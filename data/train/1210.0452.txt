    "the crab pulsar was discovered by staelin & reifenstein in 1968 through its giant pulses .",
    "giant pulses ( gps ) can be thousands of times brighter than the average pulse .",
    "the temporal occurence of gps is random but at frequencies below 3 ghz they always occur at the phase of either the crab pulsar s main pulse ( mp ) or interpulse ( ip ) @xcite . at frequencies from 4 ghz to 8.4 ghz , gps are emitted at the phases of the mp and ip as well as at the phases of two additional high - frequency components @xcite . above 8.5 ghz ,",
    "gps are again seen at only the phases of the mp and ip @xcite    the emission mechanism of gps is still an open question ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gps could be caused by increased pair production in the magnetosphere , increased coherence of synchrotron emission , or changes in beaming direction .",
    "correlating radio gps with high - energy photons is one way to determine if increased pair production is a major cause of gps .",
    "a recent model @xcite proposes that gps are generated on the last closed magnetic field line near the light cylinder via anomalous cyclotron resonance .",
    "if this is true , there would be an increase in @xmath1-rays at the times of radio gps .",
    "anomalous cyclotron resonances have been previously proposed as a cause of gp emission by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we expect the @xmath1-rays to be phase aligned with the radio gps at 1.2 ghz as the @xmath1-ray and 1.2 ghz radio profiles are aligned ( see figure [ fig : all_profiles ] ) .",
    "since we have such a large data set of gps , we can correlate them with @xmath1-ray photons to test this model .",
    "correlations between radio gps and @xmath1-ray photons have been carried out previously by @xcite and @xcite . @xcite",
    "correlated radio gps and optical photons and found a slight correlation , and work by @xcite supports this result .",
    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) is a pair conversion telescope that operates in the energy range from 20 mev to 300 gev .",
    "it has a large field of view ( 2.4 sr ) , which allows it to rapidly map the entire sky , and very good angular resolution , minimizing background contamination @xcite .",
    "the crab pulsar is a bright _ fermi _ source and has been studied at these energies .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath1-ray profile is double peaked and matches the 1.4 ghz profile , with the @xmath1-ray peaks leading the radio peaks by @xmath20.01 phase .",
    "since the lat covers the energies predicted by @xcite and observes the crab pulsar multiple times per day , we can use _ fermi _ data to test lyutikov s theory .",
    "the power - law nature of the amplitude distribution of gps is well known ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there have been varying values for the power - law index calculated , even for similar frequencies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with our large sample of gps",
    ", we can calculate power - law indices over a long timespan .",
    "since the amplitude distribution of pulses from many pulsars is log - normal @xcite , gps must have a different emission mechanism . by comparing our power - law index with those of other neutron star source classes ( pulsars , magnetars , rrats )",
    ", we may be able to put constraints on the gp emission mechanism .",
    "a @xmath1-ray flare was recently observed from the crab nebula by the agile satellite @xcite .",
    "the flare lasted from mjds 55457@xmath055461 and was also observed by _",
    "fermi _ @xcite .",
    "this occured during the span of our observations , so we can compare radio and @xmath1-ray properties of the pulsar from before the flare with a few days of data taken about two months after the flare to verify that the flare was not associated with the pulsar .",
    "current theories suggest that the flare was caused by electrons accelerated by magnetic reconnection at the termination shock of the crab nebula ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the plan for the rest of this paper is as follows .",

    "section [ stats ] discusses the gp statistics and the power - law index calculations .",
    "section [ gbtcorr ] details the correlation between 43-m and gbt gps .",
    "section [ fermicorr ] presents the _ fermi _ data used and its reduction as well as the 43-m/_fermi _ correlation . section [ flare ] discusses the recent @xmath1-ray flare .",
    "finally , conclusions are offered in section [ conc ] .",
    "we collected data over the course of 15 months using the 43-m telescope ( hereafter gb43 ) , located at the national radio astronomy observatory site in green bank , wv .",
    "the gb43 is funded by mit lincoln labs to perform bistatic radar observations of the ionosphere @xcite .",
    "most of the observations had a center frequency of 1.2 ghz with a useable bandwidth of 400 mhz , with a handful of the later observations centered at 330 mhz , with a useable bandwidth of 150 mhz .",
    "all of the observations were taken using 4096 frequency channels and varying sampling times , listed in table [ table : crab_data ] .",
    "some of the sampling times used were rather long , and this was done to decrease the data volume . in total , we observed the crab pulsar for 100 hours at 1.2 ghz and seven hours at 330 mhz .",
    "the 330 mhz mode was implemented later and used because pulsars , in general , are stronger at lower frequencies and exhibit a steep spectral index @xcite .",
    "even though the smaller bandwidth at 330 mhz reduces sensitivity by almost a factor of 2 , the steep spectrum of the crab pulsar ( @xmath3  =  3.1@xmath40.2 @xcite , where s  =  @xmath5 ) means that the pulsar is 55 times brighter at 330 mhz than at 1.2 ghz .",
    "the flux density from the crab nebula is greater at lower frequencies @xcite but , due to a shallow power - law index ( @xmath6 ) @xcite , at 330 mhz ( flux density @xmath21288  jy ) is only 1.4 times brighter than at 1.2 ghz ( flux density @xmath2909  jy )",
    ". therefore there should be many more gps above our 10@xmath7 threshold at 330 mhz than at 1.2 ghz .",
    "data were taken with wuppi , the west virginia university ultimate pulsar processing instrument .",
    "wuppi is a clone of guppi ( green bank ultimate pulsar processing instrument ) @xcite for use with the gb43 .",
    "guppi is a flexible digital backend for the gbt . like guppi",
    ", wuppi is built from reconfigurable off - the - shelf hardware and software available from the casper ( center for astronomy signal processing and electronics research ) group @xcite .",
    "both guppi and wuppi sample the data with 8-bit precision over bandwidths as large as 800 mhz , and are capable of recording all four stokes parameters . to ease disk space usage , only total intensity ( stokes i ) was recorded .",
    "the data were processed using a real - time data reduction pipeline on a 16 processor mini - cluster .",
    "the pipeline is comprised of a set of scripts , built from freely available analysis software , that can reduce a file in real time .",
    "first , a file in psrfits format @xcite has its mean bandpass divided out .",
    "frequency channels that have intensities above the resulting mean are flagged as containing radio frequency interference ( rfi ) and removed .",
    "then the resulting file is dedispersed at both a dispersion measure ( dm ) of zero and the dm of the crab , which is @xmath256.8  pc @xmath8 ; the exact values for each observation , obtained from the jodrell bank crab pulsar monthly ephemeris @xcite , are listed in table [ table : crab_data ] .",
    "the dm of the crab pulsar can vary on a monthly timescale by @xmath20.01  pc @xmath8 . in order to keep processing in real - time we did not correct for this . to ease space requirements ,",
    "raw data were not kept , so we could also not correct for this later .",
    "errors in gp arrival times due to an incorrect dm on the order of 0.01  pc @xmath8 are @xmath220  @xmath9s , which is less than the sampling time . both resulting time series",
    "are then searched for single pulses with a peak signal - to - noise ( s / n ) above 10@xmath7 using our single pulse search ( based on the algorithm described by @xcite ) .",
    "our 10@xmath7 definition of a gp is somewhat arbitrary because there is no set threshold for a gp as the weakest gps have yet to be observed .",
    "the current population of observed gps accounts for no less than 50% of the pulsed emission at frequencies around 1.6 ghz , and the inclusion of the weakest gps could bring that number up to 90% @xcite . a gp time - of - arrival ( toa ) ( measured by taking the arrival time of the peak of the pulse ) ,",
    "the s / n of that peak , and the pulse width , taken as the width of a best - fit top hat function , are recorded for each pulse .",
    "the toas from each time series are compared and if a pulse detected at the dm of the crab is within 0.1 s of a zero dm pulse , the s / n is checked for both pulses .",
    "if the s / n is higher in the zero dm pulse , the pulse is assumed to be due to rfi and removed .",
    "the pipeline outputs a profile for each gp and produces an average folded profile for the entire observation , a plot of gp arrival time vs pulse phase , and an average gp profile , made by summing all of the individual gp profiles .",
    "figure [ fig : pulse_hist ] shows the number of gps detected versus pulse phase .",
    "it is worth noting that , although there were only four post - flare observing epochs , there are many more gps than were recorded in all of the pre - flare data .",
    "this was due to a receiver upgrade which resulted in a large increase in sensitivity between our observations on mjd 55412 and mjd 55516 . at frequencies below 5 ghz @xcite ,",
    "most detected gps come at the phase of the mp , with the rest at the ip phase . in our data ,",
    "@xmath287% of detected gps were at the phase of the mp , while the other @xmath213% were at the phase of the ip .",
    "only 5% of gps detected by @xcite at 1.2 ghz were at the phase of the ip , but @xcite found that @xmath212% of gps detected at 1.4 ghz were ip gps .",
    "for detected pulses that show up out of phase with the mp and ip , the frequency versus time plots are checked by eye to see if they show the proper quadratic frequency sweep for a dm of 56.8  pc @xmath8 .",
    "if they do not , those pulses are removed . in most cases ,",
    "the rfi removal process mentioned above removes most of these false detections before they are checked by eye .",
    "we found no events at phases other than those of the mp or ip that showed the proper frequency sweep to be a real gp .",
    "most of the gps we detected have a constant intensity across the entire band .",
    "some of them , however , show variations in amplitude as a function of frequency , which have been seen before ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also see variations in amplitude between days , which is likely due to refractive interstellar scintillation ( riss ) , which can affect the strength of pulses on a timescale of days .    in order to determine if the time stamps for the gb43 are accurate , a short ( @xmath210 min ) observation of the crab pulsar was made contemporaneously on mjd 55406 at similar frequencies with the gb43 and gbt .",
    "the gb43 used a center frequency of 330 mhz , while the gbt used 350 mhz .",
    "gps were detected in each data set and their toas were compared .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : gp_ref ] , the pulse shapes of contemporaneous gps are similar , and the toas , converted to infinite frequency at the solar system barycenter , have identical arrival times to within the instrumental resolution .",
    "figure [ fig : av_profiles ] shows the average profile of the crab pulsar at 1.2 ghz and 330 mhz .",
    "the intensities are in arbitrary units .",
    "the mp and ip are visible at both frequencies .",
    "the increased width at low - frequency is due largely to dm smearing , which is on the order of 2.4  ms at the bottom of the band .",
    "the 1.2 ghz profile exhibits a weak low - frequency component ( lfc ) , about one - tenth of a pulse phase ahead of the mp ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at 330 mhz",
    "there is a precursor ( pr ) to the mp ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which is broad enough at this frequency that it shows up as the first peak of the double - peaked mp ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the frequency evolution of the pr ) , which is visible in the low - frequency gbt profile from mjd 55406 ( figure [ fig : all_profiles ] ) . due to a much larger effective resolution , the mp in the gb43 profile is unresolved and appears to have a single peak .",
    "table [ table : times ] lists the effective resolutions at the top and bottom of the band for both the 330 mhz and 1.2 ghz gb43 observations as well as the gbt 350 mhz observation",
    ".    the full - widths - at - half - maximum ( fwhms ) of the mp and ip from the gb43 profiles are @xmath2305  @xmath9s and @xmath2360  @xmath9s at 1.2 ghz and @xmath23.2  ms and @xmath21.5  ms at 330 mhz . at 330 mhz , the mp is wider than the ip due to its overlap with the pr @xcite .",
    "the average gp profiles , however , are narrower than the average folded profiles at both frequencies ( see figure [ fig : prof_comp ] ) , with fwhms of @xmath2140  @xmath9s for both the mp and ip at 1.2 ghz , and @xmath21.1  ms at 330 mhz for both the mp and ip .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that every pulse at the phase of the mp and ip is a gp , and that normal emission only comes from the pr , where no gps have been seen .",
    "we also have not seen any gps at the phase of the pr at 330 mhz in our data . even though our observed gp profiles",
    "are narrower than the average folded profiles , this hypothesis is not ruled out .",
    "@xcite found that pulse width is inversely proportional to pulse intensity , so lowering our s / n definition of a gp would include wider gps which could possibly increase the width of the average gp profile to that of the folded profile . also , the phases of weaker gps may have more deviation from the center phase of the mp and ip than stronger gps , leading to a wider average profile . unfortunately",
    ", we were unable to lower our gp threshold below 10@xmath7 as this resulted in many spurious pulses .",
    "a total of 93698 gps were observed with the gb43 . at 1.2 ghz",
    "we recorded 76707 gps at the phase of the mp and 10871 gps at the phase of the ip , and at 330 mhz 5232 mp and 888 ip gps were recorded . due to low gp statistics on some days , only 78574 mp gps and 9693 ip gps were used in fitting the amplitude distributions .",
    "we calculated , through least - squares fitting , power - law indices for the differential amplitude distributions of mp and ip gps at both 1.2 ghz and 330 mhz for each day separately .",
    "figure [ fig : amp_dist ] is an example of a power - law fit for the mp .",
    "we noted that the power - law index of gps varied daily , as was previously reported by @xcite at similar frequencies .",
    "this gave a range of power - law indices from 2.1@xmath40.3 to 3.1@xmath40.2 for mp gps at 1.2 ghz , 2.4@xmath40.4 to 2.81@xmath40.03 for ip gps at 1.2 ghz , 2.5@xmath40.2 to 2.95@xmath40.09 for mp gps at 330 mhz , and 2.4@xmath40.2 to 3.1@xmath40.2 for ip gps at 330 mhz .",
    "table [ table : indices ] lists the power - law indices for each day .",
    "these indices agree with other published power - law indices , listed in table [ table : indices_comp ] .",
    "the range of indices is likely due to wider gps having steeper spectra , as was seen by @xcite .",
    "we did not have the time resolution to separate the gps by width , as the widest gps reported by @xcite were 64  @xmath9s , which is the shortest sampling time we used .",
    "we were unable to properly calibrate the data due to lack of any off - source pointings and/or observations with a pulsed cal .",
    "there were also doubts as to the stability of the receiver over long timespans .",
    "we were able to do a rough calibration , however , by correcting for riss , which affects the strength of all gps by the same amount , so there should be no change to the power - law slope .",
    "@xcite found that the riss timescale for the crab pulsar scales as @xmath10 .",
    "based on this , the timescales at 1.2 ghz and 330 mhz are 1.7 days and 30 days , respectively .",
    "a lomb - scargle analysis @xcite of the periodicity of gp arrival times yielded periodicities of 0.41 days at 330 mhz and 0.99 days at 1.2 ghz .",
    "the @xmath2one day periodicity of the gp arrival times in the 1.2 ghz data is on the order of the riss timescale at that frequency , but the same periodicities were also seen in the randomized data set , so they are not significant .",
    "we attempted to correct for riss by scaling observations based on the brightness of their folded profiles .",
    "however , if gps dominate the average folded profile , as was seen by @xcite , any intrinsic variations in their strength will affect this correction . to determine if this was true , we removed the gps from the average profile .",
    "we found that at 1.2 ghz the amplitude of the average profile without gps was 1% less than the average profile with the gps , and at 330 mhz was 2% less .",
    "we therefore concluded that gps do not dominate the average profile .",
    "one possible reason why our results are the opposite of what was seen by @xcite is that they recorded all gps above 5@xmath7 , while we were only able to record gps above 10@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , it is possible that weaker gps dominate the average profile .",
    "if the average profile is truly dominated by gps , then correcting for riss is complicated , but since we do not see this , we used the following correction .",
    "we took the brightest folded profile from each of our three observing epochs ( pre - flare 1.2 ghz , 330 mhz , post - flare 1.2 ghz ) and scaled all of the folded profiles from those epochs to that profile .",
    "that provided us with a scaling factor for each day , by which we then multiplied the gp s / ns .",
    "we also compared our indices with power - law indices of other source classes in an attempt to constrain the gp emission physics .",
    "other source classes and their indices are listed in table [ table : source_class ] .",
    "although most normal pulsars have log - normal distributions , some pulsars have amplitude distributions that have power - law tails .",
    "these power - law exponents are included in table [ table : source_class ] under ` normal pulsars ' .",
    "our power - law indices match those of magnetars and rrats , but do not match the power - law tails seen from normal pulsars .",
    "also seen in figure [ fig : amp_dist ] is a non power - law tail , which is seen on all days in both the mp and ip .",
    "this deviation is significant , and was also seen by @xcite , who postulated these outlying gps could be supergiant pulses , indicating that there may be two distinct mechanisms for gp generation . these supergiant pulses account for slightly less than one percent of the gps used in the amplitude distributions",
    "for 16 hours over the span of eight days , we observed the crab pulsar simultaneously with the gb43 and gbt .",
    "the center frequency for gb43 observations was 1.2 ghz with 400 mhz of useable bandwidth , while that of the gbt was 8.9 ghz with 800 mhz of useable bandwidth . at high frequencies",
    "the majority of gps come at the phase of the ip , with fewer mp gps and few gps from high - frequency components ( hfcs ) ( see figure [ fig : profiles ] for a comparison of the folded profile at high and low frequencies ) . for this work , we did not use any hfc gps in our correlation analysis .",
    "we matched the barycentered arrival times of the 39900 gps with s / n @xmath11 10 recorded with the gbt ( 1035 mp gps , 38865 ip gps ) with the 7933 gps recorded simultaneously with the gb43 ( 7466 mp gps , 467 ip gps ) .",
    "we found that 236 low - frequency mp gps were also detected simultaneously at 8.9 ghz .",
    "these gps were neither the strongest nor the weakest pulses from either data set .",
    "the chance probability of this occuring is zero percent .",
    "this is not surprising , as we know that the high- and low - frequency mp are the same component .",
    "we did expect , however , that all of the mp gps detected at 8.9 ghz would be the strongest of the mp gps detected at 1.2 ghz , since the mp is significantly weaker at 8.9 ghz than at 1.2 ghz .",
    "all chance probabilities were calculated assuming poisson statistics , using the formula @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the number of detections expected and @xmath14 is the number of detections actually recorded .",
    "@xcite first noticed that the low- and high - frequency ip components of the folded profile are separated by 10@xmath15 , which is about 970  @xmath9s .",
    "we checked to see if any low - frequency ip gps were simultaneously detected at 8.9 ghz .",
    "only 23 were found ( @xmath25% ) , with a zero percent chance occurence , but this is expected since the spectral index of gps is steep @xcite .",
    "we then checked to see if low- and high - frequency ip gps commonly occured within the same rotation period of the pulsar , as was previously seen by @xcite . in our data , we found 15 instances ( @xmath24% ) of low - frequency ip gps occuring within one spin period of a high - frequency ip gp .",
    "the probability of this measurement happening by chance is 9% . in four of these instances",
    "the gps are within one @xmath9s of each other and the chance probability of this occuring is zero . in the other 11 instances ,",
    "the gps are almost one spin period apart .",
    "these are likely statistical , as there is a 10% chance of this occuring randomly .",
    "the fact that only four of the 1.2 ghz ip gps occur within one @xmath9s of an 8.9 ghz ip gp suggests that the high and low - frequency ip may be created by different physical processes @xcite possibly due to emission from different regions in the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "however , since the chance probability of detecting four low- and high - frequency ip gps within one @xmath9s is zero , it seems likely that the high - frequency ip is related to the low - frequency ip , as seen by @xcite in previous correlations of ip gps at 600 and 4850 mhz .",
    "one possibility is that both the high and low - frequency ip are reflections of the mp off of the magnetosphere @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "radio emission from the mp originating deep in the magnetosphere propagates through the electron@xmath0positron plasma that fills the magnetosphere .",
    "tranverse scattering causes the mp emission to be backscattered , causing it to arrive at a different pulse phase . if this was the case , we would expect a linear relationship between the strength of the mp and ip in the folded profile for each observation .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : mpvsip ] , we do see such a relationship at both 1.2 ghz and 330 mhz .",
    "the slopes for the 1.2 ghz and 330 mhz relations are 0.310@xmath40.004 and 0.58@xmath40.08 , respectively .",
    "one of the predictions of @xcite is that there would be increased @xmath1-ray flux during a gp . in order for this model",
    "toaccurately reproduce the data , the plasma density of the gp emission region must be @xmath210@xmath16 higher than the minimum goldreich - julian density and the duty cycle of the pulsar must be 0.001 .",
    "this increase in density could be due to enhanced pair production in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "if correct , these high - energy particles , produced during reconnection close to the y point , where the last closed magnetic field lines approach the light cylinder at the magnetic equator @xcite , are expected to produce curvature radiation from 0.1@xmath0100 gev ( depending on the value of the lorentz factor @xmath1 ) at the time of a gp .",
    "this curvature radiation would cause an increase in @xmath1-rays at the times of radio gps .",
    "data were downloaded from the _ fermi _ online archive for days when radio observations occured . ` source ' class events from pass 7 data above 100 mev were selected in an energy dependent radius ( @xmath17 @xmath18 max(6.68 @xmath0 1.76log(e),1.3)@xmath19 , where e is the energy of the photon in mev ) around the position of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "only photons in good time intervals ( gtis ) were selected and those with a zenith angle @xmath11 100@xmath19 were excluded to discriminate against @xmath1-rays generated in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the photons were converted to infinite frequency at the solar system barycenter using the _ gtbary _ utility from the fermi science tools package .",
    "we then searched for coincidences between radio gps and @xmath1-ray photons . due to clock errors in the backend on four days at 1.2 ghz ( 55097 , 55257 , 55290 , 55346 ) ,",
    "only 75131 mp and 10771 ip gps were used .",
    "however , all of the 5232 mp and 888 ip gps recorded at 330 mhz were used .",
    "this resulted in a total of 92022 gps and 393 @xmath1-ray photons , with an average @xmath1-ray photon rate of @xmath216 photons / hour , in agreement with the 15 photons / hour seen by @xcite .",
    "_ fermi _ observes the crab pulsar for about 11 hours per day , resulting in about 34 hours of simultaneous observing time .",
    "we also made energy cuts and searched for coincidences between radio gps and @xmath1-ray photons above both 500 mev and 1 gev .",
    "based on comparisons with correlations of randomized data , we found no significant correlation between mp or ip gps at both 1.2 ghz and 330 mhz and @xmath1-ray photons out to a time lag of @xmath20 spin periods .",
    "since there was not necessarily the same number of randomized @xmath1-ray photons during an observation as there were real @xmath1-ray photons , we used this large time lag to make sure that there were the same number of real and randomized correlations once all of the @xmath1-ray photons were included .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the randomized correlations were calculated by randomly assigning @xmath1-ray photon arrival times within gtis and correlating them with gp toas .",
    "figure [ fig : fermi_corr ] shows the results of this correlation analysis .",
    "the random correlations are the mean of 10000 trials , and the error bars represent one standard deviation .",
    "the largest deviation from the mean is a 2.4@xmath7 anticorrelation between @xmath1-ray photons and post - flare 1.2 ghz mp gps at a time lag of 20000 spin periods , while the largest correlation is 2.1@xmath7 for the pre - flare ip at 1.2 ghz at a time lag of 200000 spin periods .",
    "the maximum correlation / anticorrelation for each frequency at each energy cut is shown in table [ table : corrs ] .",
    "for both the mp and ip for each of the three data sets ( pre - flare 1.2 ghz , 330 mhz , post - flare 1.2 ghz ) , there are at most two time lags where the correlation exceeds 2@xmath7 .",
    "there are a total of 49 time lags included in the correlation , so two time lags are only four percent of the total data , while we statistically expect five percent of the data to have correlations beyond 2@xmath7 .",
    "given the low significance and large time lag of these results , they do not provide any compelling case for a physical origin .    selecting only @xmath1-ray photons above",
    "500 mev resulted in a total of 119 photons .",
    "the maximum correlation for this more restricted set was 2.3@xmath7 at a time lag of one spin period for pre - flare mp at 1.2 ghz .",
    "the maximum anticorrelation was 3.5@xmath7 at a time lag of 20000 spin periods for the post - flare mp at 1.2 ghz .",

    "statistically , only half of a percent of the data should be above 3@xmath7 , and two percent of our data have a 3.5@xmath7 significance .",
    "however , this is likely due to the coarseness of our time lags . given more time lags",
    ", we would expect this significance to drop below 3@xmath7 .",
    "only 65 @xmath1-ray photons had energies above 1 gev .",
    "the maximum correlation occured in the 1.2 ghz pre - flare mp with a 3.2@xmath7 significance at a time lag of one spin period .",
    "the maximum anticorrelation was 1.2@xmath7 , which occured in the 1.2 ghz pre - flare ip at a time lag of 200 spin periods .",
    "as with the 500 mev energy cut , we only see at most one time lag with above 2@xmath7 , which is insignificant . similarly , the 3.2@xmath7 siginificance is likely due to the coarseness of our time lags , and would likely drop given more time lags .",
    "the recent @xmath1-ray flare from the crab nebula was detected by the agile satellite above 100 mev @xcite .",
    "elevated @xmath1-ray flux was observed from mjds 55457@xmath055461 . no variations in pulse shape",
    "were found at @xmath1-ray @xcite , x - ray @xcite , or radio @xcite energies . @xcite also found no increase in pulsed radio flux , glitches , or changes in dm around the date of the flare .",
    "our closest observations before the flare were on mjd 55412 at 330 mhz and mjd 55352 at 1.2 ghz , and our first observation after the flare was on mjd 55516 at 1.2 ghz .",
    "we looked for changes in the average pulse profile , gp shape , power - law index , and @xmath1-ray correlation in our pre- and post - flare 1.2 ghz data .",
    "we found no significant differences in the pulse profile shape and the average gp shape ( figure [ fig : pulse_diff ] ) before and on four days about two months after the flare .",
    "the pre - flare mp power - law indices are in the range 2.1@xmath40.3 to 3.1@xmath40.2 , while the post - flare power - law indices for the mp and ip are 2.56@xmath40.05 to 2.93@xmath40.05 and 2.4@xmath40.4 to 2.81@xmath40.03 , respectively .",
    "we were unable to calculate power - law indices for the ip pre - flare due to low ip gp statistics .",
    "the largest anticorrelation between @xmath1-ray photons and gps was seen in the post - flare data , but it is still on the order of correlations / anticorrelations seen in pre - flare data , both at 1.2 ghz and 330 mhz .",
    "we compared gb43 and gbt gps and found that 3% of mp gps and 5% of ip gps at 1.2 ghz were simultaneously detected at 8.9 ghz .",
    "the probability of either of these events occuring by chance is zero .",
    "also , an additional four ip gps at 1.2 ghz were within one @xmath9s of an ip gp at 8.9 ghz , with a zero percent chance probability .",
    "this may suggest that , although the folded profiles are much different at the two frequencies , the emission mechanism is similar .",
    "however , the low percentage of low- and high- frequency ip gps within one @xmath9s could mean that the ip emission mechanism is different at higher frequencies , especially since the high - frequency ip is shifted by 10 degrees .",
    "long observations allowed us to collect the largest sample of gps to date , which we then used to calculate power - law indices for fits to amplitude distributions .",
    "these power - law indices agree with previously published values .",
    "a comparison of these indices to other source classes shows that gp emission is not exactly related to emission from other source classes and most closely matches the emission from magnetars and rrats .",

    "@xmath1-ray photons in the energy range 0.1@xmath0100 gev .",
    "there are only a few correlations / anticorrelations in the mp and ip at both frequencies .",
    "they occur at different time lags and are within 2.5@xmath7 of the mean for a correlation with randomized data .",
    "this suggests that although increased pair production in the magnetosphere may contribute to gp occurence , it is not a dominant factor .",
    "more likely possibilities for gp generation are increased coherence or changes in beaming .",
    "multifrequency correlations have been searched for previously .",
    "@xcite found a 3% increase in the brightness of optical pulses at the time of gps and @xcite found a slight correlation between gps and enhanced optical pulses , which supports our @xmath22@xmath7 correlations / anticorrelations in suggesting that there are small fluctuations in the magnetospheric particle density during gps .",
    "the anticorrelations , however , would suggest that increased particle density would lead to more radio emission and less @xmath1-ray emission , which does not make sense in the context of lyutikov s theory . since the significance of the anticorrelations are on the order of the significance of the correlations , we assume that these are insignificant .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath1-ray flux does not vary by more than 2.5 times the average flux during a gp .",
    "@xcite ruled out a strong correlation between gps at 8.9 ghz and @xmath1-ray photons above 100 mev .",
    "they were able to put an upper limit on the @xmath1-ray flux during ip gps of 8@xmath016 times the average pulsed flux , suggesting that there still might be a slight correlation between gps and @xmath1-ray photons .",
    "we could not carry out the same experiment because we did not have sufficient @xmath1-ray photons to compare the @xmath1-ray profile made with @xmath1-ray photons around gps with the @xmath1-ray profile excluding @xmath1-ray photons around gps .",
    "the recent @xmath1-ray flare from the crab nebula occured during the span of our observations , so we were able to compare the behavior of the crab pulsar before and after the flare .",
