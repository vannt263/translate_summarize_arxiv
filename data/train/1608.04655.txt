    "r0.4     understanding nuclear effects in neutrino - nucleus interactions is crucial for the reconstruction of neutrino energy spectra from which the neutrino oscillation properties are derived . by examining the kinematic correlations between final - state particles in exclusive measurements",
    ", a useful equivalence has been established between the nuclear effects and the transverse kinematic imbalance  @xcite . in this contribution , the minerva  @xcite measurement with the numi  @xcite low energy ( peak at 3 gev ) neutrino beams is presented . extending the previous analysis of ccqe - like events on ch  @xcite ,",
    "the reconstructed single - transverse kinematic imbalances are studied in simulations .",
    "based on genie  @xcite ( version 2.8.4 ) results with and without fsis are compared to demonstrate the physics sensitivity of these new variables .",
    "the event selection requires an interaction vertex in the active scintillator tracker and one muon , at least one proton , and no pion in the final state .",
    "the muon is reconstructed by the tracker and the minos near detector  @xcite .",
    "protons are identified by the tracker @xmath0 .",
    "pions are vetoed by cutting on the untracked energy and michel electrons  @xcite .",
    "once the final - state momenta are determined , they are projected onto the neutrino transverse plane .",
    "in particular , the transverse boosting angle @xmath1 is defined as in fig .",
    "[ fig : def ] . in the following sections , improvement in the momentum measurements beyond the default reconstruction and the achieved sensitivity are discussed .",
    "the proton momentum in the default reconstruction is determined by the @xmath0 profile along the track inside the tracker  @xcite . however , for non - contained or inelastically scattering protons , the profile is sensitive to the non - zero momentum at the track end point and has a distorted momentum mapping . elastically scattering contained ( esc ) protons ,",
    "whose end point momentum is 0 , are selected by @xmath0 cuts at the last 6 measurement points as they have higher @xmath0 near the end point compared to the non - esc ones .",
    "the spread of the reconstructed momentum is reduced to 60% of the default value with a reduction of statistics to 40% .",
    "an additional cut on the track fit @xmath2  @xcite further reduces the spread to 50% and statistics to 30% .",
    "cut alone the spread and statistics are reduced to 70% and 60% of the default values , respectively . ]",
    "the improvement on the detector response for the proton momentum and @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cuts ] .",
    "one notes that because non - esc protons have missing ranges , a momentum measurement by range can also be improved by selecting esc protons with such @xmath0 cuts .     and",

    "since a non - unity momentum scale leads to an instrumental apparent acceleration or deceleration of the final - state particles , it is crucial to correct the scales of @xmath4 as the imbalance is directly calculated from them .",
    "a general recipe to obtain the scales accurately is to find a @xmath4 scale - related distribution that can be described analytically . in this study ,",
    "the distributions of @xmath5 for protons and @xmath6 for muons are found to be well described by a cauchy function ( @xmath7 : transverse momentum in the detector coordinate ) .",

    "[ fig : result ] ( _ left _ ) , in the given acceptance the overall spectral shapes of the final - state momenta are not sensitive to fsis .",
