    "embedded control systems are ubiquitous and can be found in several applications including aircraft , automobiles , process control , and buildings .",
    "an embedded control system is one in which the computer system is designed to perform dedicated functions with real - time computational constraints @xcite .",
    "typical features of such embedded control systems are the control of multiple applications , the use of shared networks used by different components of the systems to communicate with each other for control , a large number of sensors as well as actuators , and their distributed presence in the overall system",
    ".    the most common feature of such distributed embedded control systems ( des ) is shared resources .",
    "constrained by space , speed , and cost , often information has to be transmitted using a shared communication network . in order to manage the flow of information in the network , protocols that are time - triggered @xcite and event - triggered @xcite",
    "have been suggested over the years .",
    "associated with each of these communication protocols are different set of advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the assignment of time - triggered ( tt ) slots to all control - related signals has the advantage of high quality of control ( qoc ) due to the possibility of reduced or zero delays , but leads to poor utilization of the communication bandwidth , high cost , overall inflexibility , and infeasibility as the number of control applications increase .",
    "on the other hand , event - triggered ( et ) schedules often result in poor control performance due to the unpredictable temporal behavior of control messages and the related large delays which occurs due to the lack of availability of the bus .",
    "these imply that a hybrid protocol that suitably switches between these two schedules offers the possibility of exploiting their combined advantages of high qoc , efficient resource utilization , and low cost @xcite .",
    "such a hybrid protocol is the focus of this paper . to combine the advantage of tt and et policies ,",
    "hybrid protocols are increasingly being studied in recent years .",
    "examples of such protocols are flexray and ttcan @xcite , used extensively in automotive systems .    while several papers have considered control using tt protocols",
    "( see for example , @xcite ) and et protocols ( see for example , @xcite ) , control using hybrid protocols has not been studied in the literature until recently .",
    "the co - design problem has begun to be addressed of late as well ( see for example , @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the design of scheduling policies that ensure a good quality of control ( qoc ) is addressed . in @xcite , the schedulability analysis of real - time tasks with respect to the stability of control functions",
    "is discussed . in @xcite , modeling the real - time scheduling process as a dynamic system , an adaptive self - tuning regulator is proposed to adjust the bandwidth of each single task in order to achieve an efficient cps utilization .",
    "the focus of most of the papers above are either on a simple platform or on a single processor .",
    "a good survey paper on co - design can be found in  @xcite .",
    "our focus in this paper is on the co - design of adaptive switching controllers and hybrid protocols so as to ensure good tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties in the plant being controlled while utilizing minimal resources in the des .",
    "the hybrid protocol that is addressed in this paper switches between a tt and a et scheme .",
    "the tt scheme , which results in a negligible delay in the processing of the control messages , is employed when a control action is imperative and the et scheme , which typically results in a non - zero delay , is employed when the controlled system is well - behaved , with minimal tracking error .",
    "the latter is in contrast to papers such as @xcite and @xcite where the underlying _ event _ is associated with a system error exceeding a certain threshold , while here an _ event _ corresponds to the case when the system error is small .",
    "the controller is to be designed for multiple control applications , each of which is subjected to a parametric uncertainty .",
    "an adaptive switching methodology is introduced to accommodate these uncertainties and the hybrid nature of the protocol .",
    "switched control systems and related areas of hybrid systems and supervisory control have received increased attention in the last decade ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and used in several applications ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "adaptive switched and tuned systems have been studied as well ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the combined presence of uncertainties and switching delays makes a direct application of these existing results to the current problem inadequate .",
    "the solution to the problem of co - design of an adaptive swtiched controller and switches in a hybrid protocol was partially considered in @xcite , where the control goal was one of stabilization . in this paper",
    ", we consider tracking , which is a non - trivial extension of @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this lies in the trigger for the switch , which corresponds to a system error becoming small . in order to ensure that this error continues to remain small even in the presence of a non - zero reference signal",
    ", we needed to utilize fundamental properties of the adaptive system with persistent excitation , and derive additional properties in the presence of reference signals with an invariant persistent excitation property . these properties in turn are suitably exploited and linked with the switching instants , and constitute the main contribution of this paper .    in section [ sec :",
    "problem ] the problem is formulated , and preliminaries related to adaptive control and persistent excitation are presented . in section [ sec : switchingadaptivecontroller ] , the switching adaptive controller is described and the main result of global boundedness is proved . concluding remarks are presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "we note that if no disturbances occur , then the choice of the algorithm in ( [ eq : protocol ] ) implies that these switches cease to exist , and the event - triggered protocol continues to be applied . and switching continues to occur with the onset of disturbances , with theorem [ thm : betaknown ] guaranteeing that all signals remain bounded with the tracking errors @xmath245 converging to @xmath246 before the next disturbance occurs .",
    "the nature of the proof is similar to that of all switching systems , in some respects .",
    "a common lyapunov function @xmath202 was used to show the boundedness of parameter estimates , which are a part of the state of the overall system ( in stage 3 ) .",
    "the additional states were shown to be bounded using the boundedness of the tracking errors @xmath247 and @xmath248 ( in stage 1 ) and the control input using the method of induction ( in stage 4 ) .",
    "since the switching instants themselves were functions of the states of the closed - loop system , we needed to show that indeed these switching sequences exist , which was demonstrated in stage 2 . to this end , the sufficient richness properties of the reference signal were utilized to show that the signal vectors of a reference model and the system converge to the same subspace .",
    "next , it was shown that the error generated by the reference model is small and thus concluded that the tracking error at the switch from tt to et stays below the threshold @xmath137 .",
    "it is the latter that distinguishes the adaptive controller proposed in this paper , as well as the methodology used for the proof , from existing adaptive switching controllers and their proofs in the literature .",
    "in this work we considered the control of multiple control applications using a hybrid communication protocol for sending control - related messages . these protocols switch between time - triggered and event - triggered methods , with the switches dependent on the closed - loop performance , leading to a co - design of the controller and the communication architecture .",
    "in particular , this co - design consisted of switching between a tt and et protocol depending on the amplitude of the tracking error , and correspondingly between two different adaptive controllers that are predicated on the resident delay associated with each of these protocols .",
    "these delays were assumed to be fixed and equal to @xmath125 for the tt protocol and greater than @xmath249 for the et protocol .",
    "it was shown that for any reference input whose order of sufficient richness stays constant , the signal vector and the parameter error vector converge to subspaces which are orthogonal to each other .",
    "the overall adaptive switching system was shown to track such reference signals , with all solutions remaining globally bounded , in the presence of an impulse - train of disturbances with the inter - arrival time between any two impulses greater than a finite constant ."
