    "the authors of @xcite proposed that this theory is related to the theory on coincident m2-branes .",
    "a careful study of the vacuum moduli space @xcite subsequently led to a more precise interpretation of this theory as describing two m2-branes at an @xmath15 orbifold singularity .",
    "a number of papers have further studied the proposal of @xcite , culminating in the results of @xcite ( abjm ) . in the latter reference ,",

    "the authors of @xcite also discussed the gravity duals of these theories , showing that they are ads@xmath18 backgrounds of m - theory , with @xmath17 units of four - form flux .",
    "these works open the way for a systematic study of ads@xmath1 m - theory backgrounds in terms of three - dimensional conformal field theories , using the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the analogous problems in the context of type iib string theory are understood rather well . in this case",
    "the gauge theories arise as the low - energy limit of d3-brane world - volume theories .",
    "the maximally supersymmetric case is the @xmath19 sym theory .",
    "one can obtain @xmath20 scfts by placing the d3-branes at a calabi - yau singularity . in the case of orbifolds or toric singularities the technology to construct these gauge theories is now standard .",
    "the gravity duals of these theories are type iib ads@xmath21 backgrounds , where @xmath22 is a sasaki - einstein five - manifold @xcite ( or orbifold ) with @xmath17 units of five - form flux . for some time",
    "an obstacle in the study of ads@xmath23/cft@xmath1 duals was the lack of examples  specifically , there existed only two ( non - orbifold ) examples where the metric was known explicitly , namely @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath26 sasaki - einstein 5-manifolds in @xcite radically improved this situation .    in dimension seven ,",
    "the classification of manifolds @xmath27 , not locally isometric to @xmath28 , admitting killing spinors falls into 3 types : weak @xmath29 manifolds , sasaki - einstein manifolds , and tri - sasakian manifolds .",
    "these admit 1 , 2 and 3 killing spinors , respectively .",
    "the killing spinor equation immediately implies that the metric is einstein with positive ricci curvature , and that ads@xmath30 , with @xmath17 units of four - form flux , is a supersymmetric solution to eleven - dimensional supergravity .",

    "we focus on sasaki - einstein manifolds that are not tri - sasakian . in dimension seven , the list of known explicit sasaki - einstein manifolds in the literature , before @xcite , consisted of the following : @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for a review of these manifolds see , for example , @xcite .",

    "in @xcite the construction of @xcite was generalised to arbitrary dimension , thus providing infinite families of sasaki - einstein manifolds in all odd dimensions .",

    "the seven - dimensional sasaki - einstein manifolds will be denoted @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we will give a presentation of the calabi - yau cones in terms of a khler quotient , also known as a gauged linear sigma model description @xcite .",
    "in fact , note that the results of this analysis were anticipated in @xcite ( see the introduction of the latter reference ) .    the description of the toric calabi - yau cones associated to the @xmath26 metrics , presented in @xcite , gave important clues that aided the identification of the dual gauge theories . in particular , the calabi - yau singularity is ( part of ) the moduli space of supersymmetric vacua of these gauge theories .",
    "it was also observed that the family of @xmath26 singularities interpolates between two limiting cases : @xmath44 and a @xmath45 orbifold of the conifold . for these the gauge theories",
    "are simple orbifolds of the @xmath19 sym and klebanov - witten theories , respectively .",
    "the geometric information in @xcite was then used in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to identify the general family of quiver gauge theories .",
    "moduli spaces of orbifolds of the abjm theory are currently under investigation @xcite .",
    "thus , the results presented here should be useful for identifying the @xmath3 conformal field theory duals to the families of ads@xmath46 backgrounds @xcite .    in the regime of parameters",
    "where @xmath47 , the backgrounds that we discuss are better described as type iia solutions of the form ads@xmath48 , with non - trivial dilaton , @xmath49 and @xmath50 rr fluxes .",
    "the non - trivial dilaton comes from the norm of the killing vector along which we reduce , and is naturally dictated by the construction of the metrics in @xcite .",

    "thus , on the natural glsm coordinates quotient . ] @xmath352 on @xmath185 , the abjm @xmath275 quotient acts as ( z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4 ) ( ^i 2/k z_1 , ^i 2/k z_2 , ^-i 2/k z_3 , ^-i 2/k z_4 )  . the coordinates on @xmath185 used in @xcite are related to the above coordinates by a non - holomorphic change of variable : @xmath353 , @xmath354 , @xmath355 , @xmath356 .",
    "notice that for @xmath119 ( and only for this value ) the action on @xmath352 and @xmath357 is obviously the same .",
    "to construct @xmath358 orbifold quivers of the abjm theory , it seems more appropriate to use the orbifold action on the @xmath352 coordinates above .",
    "however , it is not clear that the standard rules ( @xcite ) for constructing four - dimensional orbifold quivers will apply .",
    "in this paper we have studied in detail two of the families of sasaki - einstein seven - manifolds constructed in @xcite .",
    "these are the simplest examples , with the largest isometry groups .",
    "in particular , we have given gauged linear sigma model descriptions of these manifolds , discussed their topology , and also described relevant supersymmetric submanifolds and their volumes . as is the case for the five - dimensional @xmath26 manifolds @xcite",
    ", we have shown that these families interpolate between certain orbifolds of homogeneous sasaki - einstein manifolds .",
    "in particular , the family @xmath42 has a limit @xmath359 , and we discussed this orbifold in some detail .",
    "the geometric results of this paper should be a useful first step in constructing candidate ads@xmath1/cft@xmath2 dual superconformal field theories .",
    "we conclude by discussing some of the issues involved in pursuing this programme .    as a general comment ,",
    "note that a key ingredient in ads@xmath23/cft@xmath1 duality involving sasaki - einstein five - manifolds is @xmath156-maximisation @xcite . among the consequences of @xmath156-maximisation",
    "is the fact that the central charges , as well as the r - charges of a given scft , are necessarily algebraic numbers , _ i.e. _ roots of polynomials with integer coefficients .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that the volumes , and volumes of supersymmetric submanifolds , of sasaki - einstein manifolds are always algebraic numbers , in _ any _ dimension .",
    "for the examples discussed in this paper we obtain cubic irrational numbers .",
    "this strongly suggests that there should be some type of analogue of @xmath156-maximisation for three - dimensional conformal field theories with @xmath3 supersymmetry .",
    "note that the field theoretic @xmath360-minimisation of @xcite applies to such theories , although it is currently not known how to use this to obtain exact field theory results .",
    "the calabi - yau cones @xmath361 we have discussed admit explicit calabi - yau resolutions , or partial resolutions where there are residual orbifold singularities @xcite",
    ". this fact might be useful for obtaining further insight into these theories @xcite .",
    "note that such resolutions would also allow the bps `` mesonic '' spectrum to be read off @xcite from the index - character of @xcite .",
    "indeed , such generating functions have already been computed for the handful of currently - known orbifold duals in @xcite .",
    "since the geometries are toric , there will also be a dual brane web description . in this case",
    "the calabi - yau cones may be described as special lagrangian @xmath362 fibrations over @xmath147 , with certain types of degeneration of the fibres encoded combinatorially in terms of toric data .",
    "reduction and two t - dualities leads to a dual description in terms of prq-4-branes in type iia @xcite .",
    "the configuration of these 4-branes may be read off from the toric data we presented earlier .",
    "this leads to a three - dimensional `` web diagram '' , describing the locus of the prq-4-branes .",
    "the problem of finding the dual gauge theory then becomes translated into a problem of understanding the effective theory of such webs of 4-branes .",
    "again , the toric nature of these manifolds also implies that one can write down associated m - theory crystals @xcite .",
    "these are analogues of dimer configurations , although it is not clear to us how these are related to the recent chern - simons gauge theory construction of @xcite , and various follow - up papers .",
    "a possible avenue of research is to try to construct a chern - simons - matter theory that is dual to the orbifold @xmath174 .",
    "similar orbifold theories have recently been constructed and discussed in @xcite .",
    "this should be , in some sense , a limiting theory of the theories dual to @xmath42 .",
    "the aforementioned orbifold constructions simply apply the standard methods to construct the orbifold theories . however , the reasoning for this is currently obscure . in particular , the abjm orbifold @xmath363 is not simply a standard orbifold projection of the theory for @xmath364",
    " instead one changes the chern - simons level from @xmath364 to @xmath5 .",
    "a systematic understanding of how to construct orbifold theories is currently lacking .",
    "however , note that a necessary condition for a candidate theory to be dual to a particular ads@xmath365 background is that its vacuum moduli space contains the @xmath17th symmetric product of @xmath366 as a subvariety .",
    "this is because the latter is the moduli space of @xmath17 m2-branes that are transverse to the calabi - yau singularity @xmath366 .",
    "this problem , for general classes of @xmath367 , @xmath358 chern - simons quiver gauge theories , will be addressed in @xcite .",
