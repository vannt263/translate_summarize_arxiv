    "quantum error correction becomes essential for preserving coherent quantum states against not just unintended quantum transformation , but also other unwanted interactions in quantum communication and computation . with quantum error - correcting codes",
    "the original quantum information can be recovered correctly when quantum states of quantum bits , _ qubits _ , carrying the quantum information are transformed by _ quantum noise _ @xcite . unlike a classical binary @xmath4 $ ] code , which protects one of the @xmath5 discrete messages by encoding it into one of the @xmath5 codewords of length @xmath6 ,",
    "the quantum state of @xmath7 qubits is specified by @xmath5 complex coefficients .",
    "the purpose of designing quantum error - correcting codes is to encode the @xmath7 qubit state into an @xmath6 qubit state in such a way that all @xmath5 complex coefficients are perfectly stored and be able to detect and correct errors .",
    "while the importance of quantum error - correcting codes is apparent , initially , many researchers believed the nonexistence of quantum error correction codes and the process of quantum error correction is infeasible .",
    "until the mid 90 s , the discovery of the 9-qubit code by shor @xcite and 7-qubit code by steane @xcite showed that quantum error correction codes did indeed exist .",
    "their following work in @xcite showed that a class of good quantum codes , namely _ calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) codes _ , can be constructed from classical linear code @xmath8 and its dual - containing code @xmath9 .",
    "these findings have led to a rapid evolution in the research of quantum error correction and the design of quantum error - correcting codes . a general theory of quantum error correction and necessary conditions for a quantum system to form a quantum error - correcting code are given in @xcite .",
    "an encoding process of @xmath7 qubits into @xmath6 qubits is essentially a linear mapping of @xmath10 onto a @xmath7-dimensional subspace of @xmath11 , where @xmath11 denotes the quantum state space of @xmath6 qubit under tensor product ` @xmath12 ' . a special finite group of _ unitary _ transformations of @xmath11 , known as a _ clifford group _ , contains all the transformations necessary for encoding quantum codes . investigation of the connection between _ clifford group _ and existing quantum codes has led to a general construction of many new quantum codes .",
    "the initial results on this investigation were given in @xcite and later on in @xcite .",
    "several standard techniques to construct quantum codes over finite field @xmath13 and @xmath14 based on the theory of classical coding are given .",
    "thereafter , various types of quantum error correcting codes have been proposed including the formalism of _ stabilizer codes _ @xcite , @xcite , which yielded many useful insights and permitted a great number of new codes discovered using classical codes , for instance , quantum bch codes @xcite@xcite , quantum reed - solomon codes @xcite , quantum convolutional codes @xcite @xcite @xcite , codeword stabilized quantum codes @xcite , non - binary quantum stabilizer codes @xcite and quantum non - additive codes @xcite @xcite .",
    "the conventional _ cyclic _ codes are good candidates of error - correcting codes in terms of high minimum distance and low encoding complexity @xcite .",
    "these advantages enable the design of quantum cyclic codes and quantum _ shift registers _ that have been initially studied in @xcite .",
    "it is known that a conventional @xmath15 $ ] cyclic code can be fully generated from a unique monic polynomial @xmath16 of minimal degree @xmath17 over a field @xmath18 .",
    "this monic polynomial @xmath16 is often called the _",
    "generator polynomial_. however , the generator polynomial of a cyclic code is not easy to obtain especially in the field of higher order .",
    "moreover , while majority classical cyclic codes attain promising distance property , they tend to have poor sparseness when code length is large .",
    "fortunately , the conventional sparse - graph codes , particularly low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) @xcite codes ascertain both the sparseness and a large minimum distance .",
    "a well known subclass of ldpc codes , namely _ quasi - cyclic _ ldpc codes , also possess the simplicity of encoding .",
    "however , compared with the design of ldpc codes in classical settings , the commutative constraint ( also referred to as _ the symplectic inner product _ constraint ) for quantum codes that sets on a pair of parity - check matrices complicates the design of quantum ldpc codes . in particular",
    ", the classical design of ldpc codes utilizing randomness @xcite-@xcite is not helpful in the design of quantum ldpc codes .",
    "the idea of quantum ldpc codes was first given by postol in @xcite , whereas generalization of quantum ldpc codes was proposed a few years later by mackay _",
    "since then , a wide range of different types of sparse - graph quantum codes have been designed , _",
    "e.g. , _ @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate efficient methods for designing @xmath19 $ ] quantum stabilizer codes , where the double solid bracket is commonly used to distinguish from a classical @xmath4 $ ] code . in particular , we focus on the use of _ quadratic residue ( qr ) sets _ as our basic building block to explore systematic design techniques for new quantum stabilizer codes . more importantly , by taking full advantages of both conventional cyclic codes and sparse - graph codes , we aim at constructing new structured quantum stabilizer codes of variable code length .",
    "to illustrate the potential of our proposed methods , we focus on two particular categories of quadratic residue sets and show that they exhibit different properties under the same commutative constraint .",
    "we propose two types of quantum stabilizer codes of length @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , where @xmath20 is the prime modulus of a quadratic residue set for some non - negative integer @xmath21 and @xmath3 is the size of the quadratic residue set .",
    "we refer to them as type - i and type - ii quantum stabilizer codes . to illuminate the simplicity of the proposed construction methods , unlike traditional cyclic codes that are generated from a generator polynomial",
    ", we design type - i quantum stabilizer codes from _ idempotent polynomial _ of quadratic residue sets .",
    "furthermore , we give systematic design methods for type - ii quasi - cyclic stabilizer ( qcs ) codes by introducing a two step _ position - and - lift _ operation . in this design ,",
    "we first place each quadratic residue set into a special format of _ latin square _ , as we refer to as a _ proto - matrix_. then , by using _",
    "circulant permutation matrices _",
    ", we lift the pre - obtained proto - matrix and obtain the parity - check matrix for a type - ii qcs code .    the key results of the paper , the design methods for type - i and type - ii quantum stabilizer codes , can be applied to any quadratic residue set of prime modulus @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , we prove that the minimum distance for type - i stabilizer codes of length @xmath23 is upper bounded by the size of quadratic reside set @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the code rate for type - i stabilizer codes of length @xmath24 is determined by @xmath25 , and the code rate approaches @xmath26 as @xmath21 goes to infinity .",
    "furthermore , in the design of type - ii qcs codes , we use the generator element of quadratic residue sets to construct the proto - matrix . to satisfy the commutative constraint , two proto - matrices need to be _ commutative _ and",
    "_ adjunction _ of an additional element to the proto - matrix is required for codes with @xmath27 , whereas for codes with @xmath28 only one proto - matrix needs to be commutative . by using decomposition of vandermonde matrix ,",
    "we show that the dimension of type - ii qcs codes is @xmath29 if @xmath21 is odd or @xmath30 if @xmath21 is even .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follow : we review the theory of quantum stabilizer codes in the next section . in section iii",
    ", we give explicit design procedures and analysis for type - i stabilizer codes of length @xmath31 after the preliminaries on quadratic residue sets and its idempotents .",
    "thereafter , we design type - ii qcs codes from quadratic residue sets of modulus @xmath20 . before we conclude in section vi with further discussions , we present some constructed codes of both type - i and type - ii stabilizer codes in section v.",
    "the state of single qubit @xmath32 exists in the _ superposition _ @xmath33 of two basis states @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are complex numbers and @xmath38 .",
    "likewise , the state of @xmath6 qubit could exist in the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is shorthand for the tensor product @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the quantum state space of @xmath6 qubits @xmath11 is a composition of @xmath6 copies of @xmath43 through tensor product , where each copy is corresponds to a qubit .",
    "since the process of _ quantum measurement _ destroys the superposition state @xcite , quantum error - correcting codes of stabilizer framework ensure that with partial measurement outcome from _ unitary operators _ , reliable transmission of encoded states can be achieved . in the rest of the section , a brief overview of quantum stabilizer codes",
    "is given .",
    "let @xmath44 be the quantum state space of @xmath6 qubits and @xmath45,x=[\\begin{smallmatrix}0&1\\\\1&0\\end{smallmatrix}],z=[\\begin{smallmatrix}1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{smallmatrix}],y = ixz\\}$ ] be the pauli group that acts on a single qubit , where @xmath46 is the imaginary unit and @xmath47 is the overall phase factor with @xmath48 .",
