    "the discrete velocity boltzmann schemes present certain advantages compared to the continuous molecular velocity based upwind schemes by being simpler in design and analysis of numerical schemes . in this work , we introduce discrete velocities by using a novel interpretation and a slight modification of the strategy used by sanders & prendergast @xcite and further introduce a discrete velocity boltzmann scheme for solving euler equations of gas dynamics .",
    "kinetic or boltzmann schemes exploit the connection between the boltzmann equation of kinetic theory of gases and the macroscopic conservation laws of gas dynamics , obtained as moments of the boltzmann equation .",
