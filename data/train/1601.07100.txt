    "our mmoc scheme is made possible by an eit - related quantum interference effect and the long lifetime of the rydberg states .",

    "we have analysed a realistic implementation for the interconversion of terahertz and optical fields with an ensemble of trapped rubidium atoms , and find that the conversion efficiency can exceed 90% .",
    "efficient conversion requires a large spatial overlap between the mm - wave and optical fields , and we have discussed two possible scenarios how to achieve this .",
    "first , we have considered focussed terahertz beams and found that high conversion efficiencies are possible if the rayleigh length of the beams is comparable to the length of the atomic cloud .",
    "second , we investigated a setup where the mm - wave fields are transversally confined by a waveguide and the atoms are trapped inside the waveguide core .",
