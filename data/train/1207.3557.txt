    "entanglement @xcite is a quantum correlation without classical counterpart and has been widely believed as the main reason for the computational advantage of quantum over classical algorithms .",
    "however , it has been found recently that there exist strong indications @xcite that an more general quantum correlation , quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite , is the resource responsible for the speed up in the deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit ( dqc1 ) @xcite . moreover , quantum discord is more robust than the entanglement against decoherence such that quantum algorithms based only on quantum discord might be more robust than those on entanglement .",
    "quantum discord @xcite , as a up - and - coming quantum correlation , often arises as a consequence of coherence between different partitions in a quantum system , being present even in separable states .",
    "this quantum correlation has received much attention in quantum computation @xcite , quantum communication @xcite , dynamics of quantum discord @xcite , quantum phase transitions(qpts ) @xcite , witnessing @xcite etc .    on the other hand , the spin chain model have been proposed as a very reliable model for the future quantum - computing technology in different solid - state systems and a rich model for studying the novel physics of localized spin systems .",

    "the entanglement undergoes a nonergodic behavior .",
