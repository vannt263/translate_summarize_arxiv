    "understanding the formfactors of the hadronic currents is one of the main problems in particle physics .",
    "as is well known , the knowledge of the formfactors allows one the determination of the quark mixing parameters , in a unique way @xcite .",
    "moreover , it gives us a direct information about the dynamics of the hadronic processes at large distance , where perturbation theory of qcd is invalid . at present",
    "there exists no theoretical method for calculating the formfactors , starting from a fundamental qcd lagrangian .",
    "therefore , in estimating the formfactors , usually phenomenological or semiphenomenological methods are used .",
    "along these lines , there exists two well known methods for calculating the hadronic form factors .",
    "first of these is the pole model description based on the vector dominance idea , that suggests a momentum dependence dominated by the nearest pole , and the other one is the qcd sum rules method .",
    "the pole model approach does not have its roots on the basic principles of the theory and is purely phenomenological .",
    "generally , it is assumed that the vector dominance approximation is valid at zero recoil , that is at @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the square of the momentum transfer , that depends on the formfactor , and @xmath9 is the mass of the nearest vector meson . however , there are no reliable arguments in favour of the pole model , for it to be also valid at small @xmath8 , that are interesting for practical applications .",
    "the effective heavy quark theory predicts somewhat larger region of validity , characterized by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the heavy quark mass ( for more detail see @xcite and the references cited therein ) .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the pole behaviour of the formfactors is consistent with the @xmath8 dependence at @xmath12 predicted by the sum rule .",
    "this result has been confirmed independently by the calculations carried within the framework of the light cone sum rules @xcite .    in contrary to the pole model",
    ", the qcd sum rules method is based on the first principles and on the fundamental qcd lagrangian . in this work",
    "we employ an alternative version of the qcd sum rules , namely light cone sum rules method for the calculation of the formfactors .",
    "we note that using this approach , the formfactors of the @xmath13 transition @xcite , the pion formfactors at the intermediate momentum transfer @xcite , semileptonic b and d decays @xcite , radiative @xmath14 decay formfactor @xcite and @xmath15 transition formfactors @xcite are calculated .",
    "the results of all works that have been devoted to the calculation of the formfactors confirm that , the predictions of the pole model are compatible with that of the qcd sum rules method .",
    "note that , in all these works the transition formfactors between the ground state mesons are considered .    in connection with these observations",
    ", there follows an immediate question to whether the same agreement holds for the prediction of the formfactors resulting from the decays of the excited meson states .",
    "this article is devoted to find an answer to the question cited above , more precisely , we calculate the formfactors for the excited @xmath16 wave decays @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the excited @xmath16 wave meson state , and @xmath19 is the @xmath20 state .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sect.2 , we derive the sum rules for the @xmath17 transition formfactors .",
    "sect.3 is devoted to the numerical analysis and discussions .",
    "for calculation of the sum rules formfactors for the @xmath17 transition , we consider the following correlator , _ ( q_2,q ) = i d^4x  e^iq_2x  ^-(q ) |d x _",
    "q x |q 0 _ _ 5 u 0 0  , [ 1 ] where , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the interpolating currents of @xmath20 and @xmath3 , respectively , @xmath23 is the heavy quark , @xmath24 is the momentum of the @xmath20 meson and @xmath25 is the pion s momentum .",
    "when the pion is on the mass shell , i.e. , @xmath26 , the correlator depends on two invariant variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in further calculations",
    ", we will set @xmath29 .",
    "we start by considering the physical part of eq.([1 ] ) . before calculating the physical part of the eq.(1 ) , few words are in order . according to the value of angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom @xmath30 , the heavy quark effective theory @xcite , predicts the existence of two multiplets , each including the @xmath3 meson : the first one contains @xmath31 and the second @xmath32 mesons . in terms of the conventional @xmath33 states , the @xmath3 states defined above ( physical states ) ,",
    "are given by the following linear combinations @xcite : 1^+ _ & = & ^1p_1 + ^3p_1 + 1^+ _ & = & ^1p_1 - ^3p_1   .",
    "therefore , the physical part of the eq.(1 ) must contain the contributions from both of the @xmath3 mesons , and it can be written as _ = _",
    "l= ,  . [ 2 ]    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that in the heavy quark limit , @xmath34 , 1^+ _",
    "|q _ _ 5 u 0 = 0  .",
    "the full theory can only bring small corrections to this result .",
    "for this reason the contribution of the @xmath35 meson , in eq.(2 ) , can safely be neglected .",
    "therefore , in future analysis we will consider the contribution of the @xmath36 meson only , and for simplicity we denote it as @xmath37 .    the matrix elements entering in eq.([2 ] ) are defined in the standard manner : p_1 |q _ _ 5 u 0 & = & - i f_p_1 m_p_1 _ ( p )  , +    @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the leptonic decay constant , vector polarization and mass of the excited @xmath3 meson , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the formfactors that describe the @xmath44 transition .",
    "the contributions of the coefficients of @xmath42 and @xmath43 to the decay rate are proportional to m_^2 + m_p_1-m_p^ * ^2  . from this expression",
    "it is obvious that , their contributions are small in comparison to the @xmath41 s contribution .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that the contributions of @xmath42 and @xmath43 to the decay width constitute about @xmath45 of @xmath41 , and hence , we shall neglect such terms .",
    "= - i f_0 -g _",
    "+  , and in further analysis we will pay our attention to the structure @xmath46 and denote its coefficient by @xmath47 .",
    "the physical part of the above relation takes the following form : q_2 ^ 2,(q_2+q)^2 = -i + i _ s_0^  .",
    "[ 4 ] the first term on the right hand side is the pole term due to the ground state in the heavy channel , while the continuum and the higher order states are taken into account by the dispersion integral above the threshold @xmath48 .    let us now consider the theoretical part of the correlator ( [ 1 ] )",
    ". this correlator function can be calculated in qcd at large euclidean momenta @xmath28 . in this case",
    "the virtuality of the heavy quark is of the order @xmath49 , and this is a large quantity .",
    "therefore , we can expand the heavy quark propagator in powers of the slowly varying fields residing in the pion , that acts as the external field on the propagating heavy quark .",
    "the expansion in powers of the external fields is also the expansion of the propagator in powers of a deviation from the light cone at @xmath50 .",
    "the leading contribution is obtained by using the free heavy quark propagator in eq.([1 ] ) s_q^0(x ) = i e^-ikx  .",
    "hence , _ ( q_2,q ) = ( q ) |q(x ) _ k+m_q _ _ 5 u(0)0  . [ 5 ] we point out that , in eq.([5 ] ) and throughout the course of the present analysis , the path - ordered factor @xmath51 has been omitted , since in the fock - schwinger gauge @xmath52 , this factor is trivial .",
    "it follows from eq.([5 ] ) that , the answer is expressed via the pion matrix element of the gauge invariant , nonlocal operator with a light cone separation @xmath53 . following @xcite ,",
