    "stars with extremely low metal abundances are of particular astrophysical and cosmological interest because they probe very early times in the evolution of the universe and its galactic components .",
    "however , it is very difficult to determine their absolute ages to within @xmath920% .",
    "nearly all of the metal - poor stars that can be age - dated reliably are found in globular clusters ( gcs ) or dwarf galaxies , but even when tight , well - defined color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) are available for them , the ages that are inferred from fits of isochrones to the observed cmds depend critically on the adopted distances and chemical abundances .",
    "for instance , a @xmath10 mag uncertainty in the assumed distance modulus translates to a change in the estimated age by @xmath11 gyr  which is also implied by the assumption of an oxygen abundance that is altered by @xmath12 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in view of such sensitivities , it is not surprising that recent estimates of the ages of well - studied gcs like m92 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and 47 tucanae ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) range over as much as 23 gyr",
    ".    ages of considerably higher accuracy are possible for field population ii stars _ if _ they are close enough that accurate and precise trigonometric parallaxes can be obtained for them _ and _ they are in the subgiant phase of evolution .",
    "isochrones for different ages are most widely separated in the region of a cmd between the turnoff ( to ) and the base of the red - giant branch ( rgb ) ; i.e. , the luminosities of stars , at a fixed effective temperature ( @xmath13 ) or color , are predicted to depend most strongly on age when they are evolving along what is usually referred to as the subgiant branch ( sgb ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the ages of such stars can be determined directly from their locations relative to isochrones that have been computed for their observed chemical abundances .",
    "although the ramifications of temperature and/or color uncertainties are not insignificant , such comparisons between theory and observations benefit from the fact that the slope of the sgb is relatively shallow on the @xmath14-diagram and most cmds . a further big advantage of studying nearby sgb stars , as opposed to their counterparts in considerably more distant systems ,",
    "is that much higher resolution , higher s / n spectra may be used to determine their metal abundances .",
    "moreover , the foreground reddenings are small and they can be determined precisely from the interstellar naid lines .",
    "hd140283 , which has long been known to have [ fe / h ] @xmath15 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , is the most famous example of a solar - neighborhood subgiant that provides a direct constraint on the ages of field stars of similar metallicity due to its auspicious location on the h - r diagram .",
    "the parallax that was initially derived for it , @xmath16 mas , from measurements taken with the _ hipparcos _ astrometric satellite ( @xcite ) yielded @xmath17 , depending on the adopted apparent magnitude , reddening , and the statistical corrections that were applied ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding age of hd140283 was determined to be @xmath18 gyr ( where the error bar takes into account only the distance uncertainty ) by @xcite , using isochrones based on university of montreal stellar models that treated all of the important diffusive processes ( @xcite ) . at nearly the same time",
    ", the age of the universe was found to be @xmath19 gyr from the analysis by @xcite of first - year _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _ observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the similarity of these results suggests that hd140283 has the potential to provide an interesting test of stellar physics and cosmology , and to contribute to our understanding of the first epochs of star formation in the early universe , _ if _ its age can be pinned down much more precisely .    to this end",
    ", we began a program in 2003 august to improve upon the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes of hd140283 and the two other nearest metal - deficient subgiants , hd84937 and hd132475 , using the fine guidance sensors ( fgss ) on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. [ hd140283 and hd132475 , which differ in [ fe / h ] by @xmath20 dex , are arguably the best candidates for such a study because they are located approximately midway between the to and the lower rgb ; see ( * ? ? ? * his figs .  9 and 32 ) .",
    "hd84937 lies closer to the to , and in fact , it has sometimes been considered to be a blue straggler ; e.g. , @xcite .",
    "] as reported by @xcite , our reduction of the observations of hd140283 that were obtained between 2003 and 2011 resulted in a value of @xmath21 mas , which agrees remarkably well with the value derived by ( * ? ? ? * @xmath22 mas ) in his re - analysis of the original _ hipparcos _ data , but with a factor of 5 improvement in the precision of the result .",
    "on the assumption of @xmath23 ( @xcite ) and @xmath24 ( @xcite ) , the fgs parallax yielded an absolute magnitude @xmath25 . according to the many published spectroscopic studies that were consulted ( see the bond et al .",
    "paper for references ) , hd140283 has [ fe / h ] @xmath26 and [ o / h ] @xmath27 : these values were adjusted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 dex , respectively , to compensate for the predicted effects of diffusion and turbulent mixing on its surface abundances over its lifetime ( @xcite ) . from up - to - date isochrones for the resultant _",
    "initial _ metal abundances , the age of hd140283 was found to be @xmath30 gyr , where the [ o / h ] and @xmath13 uncertainties contribute more to the total error bar than the distance uncertainty ( which amounts to @xmath31 gyr ) .",
    "the current best estimate of the age of the universe is @xmath32 gyr , based on observations of the cmb using the _ planck _ satellite ( @xcite ) , in excellent agreement with the latest _",
    "derivation of @xmath33 gyr ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that the oldest population ii stars probably formed @xmath340.3 gyr after the big bang , depending on how quickly the gas from the first ( population iii ) supernovae was able to cool and condense , as well as such factors as the severity of the pop .",
    "iii feedback .",
    "hence , the age that bond et al .",
    "( 2013 ) obtained for hd140283 is about 0.8 gyr older than its expected maximum age .",
    "although 13.513.6 gyr is only just outside the @xmath35 error bar on the age of hd140283 ( when all sources of error are considered ) , which is not a severe inconsistency , it is clearly worthwhile to take a second , hard look at all of the factors that play a role in the age determination , including the parallax , the adopted metal abundances , and the stellar models . in particular , we decided to carry out our own analysis of high - resolution spectra of hd140283 ( and the other subgiants in our sample ) rather than rely on published ( sometimes discordant ) chemical abundance determinations .",
    "the next section provides an overview of the procedures used to derive trigonometric parallaxes using the fgss and the results that we obtained for our target stars .",
    "our spectroscopic analyses , the stellar models that have been used , and the determination of the ages of the subgiants are fully described in sections [ sec : atm ] , [ sec : models ] , and [ sec : ages ] , respectively .",
    "the implications of our findings for the distances , ages , and [ fe / h ] scales of globular clusters is the subject of   [ sec : gcs ] , which also includes some discussion concerning the rr lyrae @xmath36 versus [ fe / h ] relationship .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are summarized in   [ sec : sum ] .",
    "our astrometric measurements were made with the fgss onboard the _",
    "hst_. they are a set of three interferometers that can sequentially measure precise positions of a target star and several surrounding astrometric reference stars with one fgs ( fgs1r ) , while the other two ( fgs2 and fgs3 ) are locked on guide stars in order to maintain telescope pointing .",
    "our fgs observations of each halo subgiant consisted of two _ hst _ orbits each at five epochs , taken near the biannual dates of maximum parallax factor , for a total of 10 _ hst _ orbits per target ( 11 for hd140283 ) .",
    "the observations were made as follows : hd84937 between 2003 november and 2005 november ; hd132475 between 2003 august and 2006 february ; and hd140283 between 2003 august and 2006 march , with an additional single orbit of observation in 2011 march .    during each _ hst _ orbit , we used fgs1r in `` position '' mode to measure the relative positions of the subgiant and six or seven faint neighboring background reference stars .",
    "each reference star was observed for about 30  s , three to four times per orbit , interspersed with five or more measurements of the subgiant .",
    "the data gathered over the course of an orbit were processed and calibrated as a single  plate . \"",
    "( the repeated exposures of the same stars are used to model and remove telescope pointing drift resulting from the changing thermal environment as the _ hst _ orbits the earth . ) guide - star telemetry from the two guiding fgss was used to remove high - frequency spacecraft pointing jitter from the fgs1r astrometric data . because of refractive components in the fgs optical chain , color - dependent corrections to the astrometry were applied as functions of @xmath37 color for each star ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their   3.3 for details ) ) .",
    "finally , the fgs data were corrected for differential velocity aberration and geometric distortion ( `` optical field angle distortion '' ) to produce the astrometric measurements from each _ hst _ orbit .",
    "data from the ten or eleven orbits were combined using an updated version of the least - squares overlapping - plate gaussfit program ( @xcite ) , which solves for the plate constants ( rotation , translation , and scale ) along with the parallax and proper motion ( pm ) of each star . however , since the fgs measures only relative positions , the pms and estimated parallaxes of the reference stars must be input as priors to the model in order to obtain an absolute parallax and pm of the subgiant .",
    "we estimated the input reference - star parallaxes based on ground - based photometry and spectroscopic observations ( see next subsection ) .",
    "their input pms were obtained from the ppmxl ( @xcite ) or ucac4 ( @xcite ) catalogs ; we chose the input catalog for each field that yielded the lower @xmath38 value , which proved to be ppmxl for the hd84937 field and ucac4 for the other two .",
    "these reference - star data are provided to the model as observations with errors , not as fixed values .",
    "this allows gaussfit freedom to adjust the values within their stated errors to find the overall best @xmath38 solution .",
    "we assumed a 20% uncertainty in the distance of each reference star , corresponding to a @xmath39  mag uncertainty in their absolute magnitudes .",
    "( an overview of parallax measurements with the fgss can be found in @xcite . )",
    "the input ground - based pms generally have large uncertainties , relative to the high precision of the _ hst _ measurements .",
    "this results in elevated residuals in all of the other quantities computed by the model . to mitigate this , we first executed the model with the ground - based measurements and errors , and then used the resulting fgs pms and errors as input to the next iteration .",
    "we found that , while this does not appreciably change the pms after the first iteration , the resulting @xmath38 and residuals are generally reduced by a few tens of percent .",
    "the @xmath40 brightness of hd140283 necessitated the use of the f5nd attenuator ( required for targets brighter than @xmath41 ) on the subgiant , while the fainter reference stars were observed using the f583w spectral element .",
    "this introduces a cross - filter wedge effect that shifts the position of hd140283 relative to the field stars in a manner similar to parallax .",
    "fortunately , this cross - filter shift ( on the order of 8  mas ) is well calibrated near the two locations in the fgs1r field of view where hd140283 was observed over the course of the program .",
    "nonetheless , there remains a @xmath34  mas systematic uncertainty in the cross - filter calibration , which must be added in quadrature to the statistical errors computed by gaussfit .",
    "this had not been included in the uncertainties reported for hd140283 by @xcite , but is incorporated now . for the other two targets , hd84937 and hd132475 ,",
    "the f5nd filter was not used for any of the observations .",
    "we made distance estimates for the reference stars based on ground - based spectroscopy and photometry .",
    "for spectral classification , digital spectra in all three fields were obtained by us with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope and hydra spectrograph at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) in 2004 and 2007 , and by service observers on the 1.5-m smarts telescope and ritchey - chretien spectrograph at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) in 2003 through 2005 . the classifications",
    "were then determined through comparisons with a network of mk standards obtained with the same telescopes , assisted by equivalent - width measurements of lines sensitive to temperature and luminosity .",
    "photometry of the reference stars in the johnson - kron - cousins _ bvi _ system was obtained with the smarts 1.3-m telescope at ctio , using the andicam ccd camera , and calibrated to the standard - star network of @xcite .",
    "each field was observed by chilean service observers on four different photometric nights in 2003 through 2005 .",
    "additional photometry was obtained by h.e.b .  with the ctio 0.9-m telescope on one night in 2001 and with the kpno 0.9-m telescope on two nights in 2007 ; and by d.h .  with the kpno 2.1-m telescope on single nights in 2003 and 2004 .",
    "table  [ tab : tab1 ] gives the designations , coordinates , photometry , and spectral types of the reference stars in columns 1 through  7 .",
    "the uncertainties in the magnitudes and colors , based on the internal agreement , are typically about @xmath42 and @xmath43  mag , respectively . to estimate the reddening of the reference stars ( assumed to be the same for all stars in each field , since their distances place them well beyond the dust of the galactic disk ) , we compared the observed @xmath37 color of each star with the intrinsic @xmath44 color corresponding to its spectral type , and calculated the average @xmath45 for each field .",
    "the intrinsic colors were taken from literature compilationsemamajek / eem_dwarf_ubvijhk_colors_teff.dat for dwarfs , and at urls similar to http://www.pas.rochester.edu/@xmath46emamajek/spt/k0iii.txt for subgiants and giants . ] assembled by e.  mamajek .",
    "these averages agreed very well with @xmath45 values from the extinction maps of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sf11 ) , as implemented at the nasa / ipac website .",
    "our adopted values of @xmath45 were 0.037 , 0.100 , and 0.130  mag for the background fields of hd84937 , hd132475 , and hd140283 , respectively .",
    "for the distance estimations , we used a purely empirical approach , which is based on determining the luminosity class from the spectroscopic data , and then using the dereddened photometry to estimate the absolute magnitude , @xmath36 . for subgiants and giants",
    ", we found the absolute magnitudes by interpolation in a fiducial sequence [ @xmath36 vs.  @xmath47 for the old open cluster m67 ( @xcite ) , which we took to be representative of the faint population at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , in turn , for hd84937 , hd132475 , and hd140283 ) .",
    "for the reference stars classified as dwarfs , we followed the algorithm described in @xcite , which in brief is based on calibrations of the visual absolute magnitude against @xmath37 and @xmath50 colors through polynomial fits to a sample of 791 single main - sequence stars with accurate _",
    "photometry and _ hipparcos _ or usno parallaxes of 40  mas or higher ( provided online by i.  n.  reid ) .",
    "this calibration includes a correction for metallicity , estimated from each star s position in the @xmath37 vs.  @xmath50 diagram .",
    "we tested our algorithm by applying it to 136 nearby stars with accurate parallaxes and a wide range of metallicities listed by @xcite .",
    "we reproduced their known absolute magnitudes with an _ rms _ scatter of only 0.28  mag . at the distances of the reference stars , ranging mostly from about 500 to 1700  pc , this scatter corresponds to parallax errors of 0.08 to 0.24  mas .    the final two columns in table  [ tab : tab1 ] give the input estimated parallaxes and associated errors for the reference stars , and the final adjusted parallax that was output by the gaussfit routine . in most cases ,",
    "the adjustments were quite small .",
    "table  [ tab : tab2 ] presents our final astrometric results for the three halo subgiants .",
    "columns  2 through 4 show the _ hipparcos _ pm components and parallaxes , and columns 5 through  7 show our fgs results .",
    "note that we have reanalyzed the fgs data for hd140283 that were presented by @xcite , using the identical procedures employed for the other two targets in the present paper .",
    "our results for this star are thus very slightly different from those published in 2013 .",
    "the error bar for hd140283 also now includes the uncertainty due to use of the neutral - density filter , as discussed above in ",
    "[ subsec : fgs ] .",
    "the fgs pms agree very well with those found by _",
    "hipparcos_. however , there are slight offsets in the pm zero - points for the fgs measurements compared to the absolute pms of _ hipparcos _ , because the fgs reference frames are based on only about half a dozen background stars chosen from the ppmxl or ucac4 catalogs .",
    "these catalogs have errors in the absolute pms per star of several mas  yr@xmath51 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our parallaxes likewise agree extremely well with _",
    "hipparcos _ for two of our targets , but our statistical uncertainties are about 2.54 times smaller . for hd84937 ,",
    "our fgs parallax measurement is smaller than that found by _ hipparcos _ , by about 2@xmath52 in units of the _ hipparcos _ uncertainty .",
    "we note that offsets of a similar amount and sign between _ hipparcos _ parallaxes and precise fgs and/or radio - interferometric parallaxes have sometimes been found by other investigators , e.g. , for the pleiades cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we derive atmospheric parameters and the abundances of those elements that are of particular relevance for the determination of the ages of metal - poor stars from fits of isochrones .",
    "most important are o and fe , but we also comment on the abundances of c and n as well as the @xmath53-capture elements , mg , si , and ca . [ we include hd19445 among the stars that are subjected to a spectroscopic analysis because it is used in   [ sec : ages ] to check the reliability of isochrones for [ fe / h ] @xmath54 at @xmath55 ( @xmath20 mag below the turnoff ) .",
    "hd19445 is the best available subdwarf for this purpose because of its large and well - determined parallax from _ hipparcos _",
    "( @xmath56 mas ; @xcite ) . ]",
    "the abundances were derived from equivalent widths ( ews ) measured in high - resolution uves ( @xcite ) and harps spectra ( @xcite ) obtained during the eso programs that are listed in the footnote of table  [ tab : tab3 ] .",
    "an exception is hd132475 for which the ews of the oi triplet lines were measured from eso / ces spectra ( @xcite ) . the uves and harps spectra have resolutions around @xmath57 and signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios ranging from 400 to 800 . as the continuum in the spectra of these metal - poor stars",
    "is well defined , the high s / n makes it possible to measure equivalent widths of weak lines with very high accuracy .",
    "a comparison of ews measured in overlapping uves and harps spectral regions shows a _",
    "rms _ dispersion of only 0.6m , suggesting that the mean ew is measured with an accuracy of @xmath58m .",
    "plane parallel ( 1d ) model atmospheres interpolated to the @xmath13 , @xmath59 , and [ fe / h ] values of the stars were obtained from the @xmath53-element enhanced ( [ @xmath53/fe ] @xmath60 ) marcs grid ( @xcite ) and used to calculate ews as a function of element abundance , assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "interpolation to an observed ew then yields the corresponding abundance . a microturbulence of 1.4kms@xmath51 was adopted .",
    "this value is obtained for hd132475 by demanding that the derived fe abundance shows no systematic dependence on ew . for the other stars , the lines are so weak that the microturbulence parameter has no significant effect on the derived abundances .",
    "the effective temperatures given in table  [ tab : tab4 ] are based on the calibration of the infrared flux method ( irfm ) by @xcite and taken from @xcite , except in the case of hd140283 .",
    "for this star , we detect weak interstellar naid lines ( @xmath61 and 11.5m ) , which implies @xmath62 according to the calibration of @xcite .",
    "this increases the irfm temperature of hd140283 from @xmath63k , as reported by melndez et al . , who assumed @xmath64 , to @xmath65k .",
    "the statistical errors associated with the irfm temperatures are on the order of @xmath66k according to @xcite , but in addition , there could be systematic errors of the particular @xmath13-scale that is adopted .",
    "for instance , using a different implementation of the irfm based on 2mass photometry , @xcite derived @xmath67 values for hd19445 , hd84937 , and hd140283 that are an average of 80k cooler than those by casagrande et al . in the case of hd132475",
    ", they find a higher temperature ( 5815k ) , but this is probably because they assume a reddening of @xmath68 instead of the value that we favor , @xmath69 , which is based on the strength of interstellar naid lines .    as a check of the @xmath13-scale ,",
    "we have compared the irfm - based temperatures with those derived from the wings of the balmer lines .",
    "this spectroscopic determination has the advantage of being independent of interstellar reddening . for the best studied star , hd140283 , @xcite obtained @xmath70k from h@xmath53 and h@xmath71 , while @xcite found @xmath72k from h@xmath53 and @xcite determined @xmath73k from h@xmath71 .",
    "the average of these values , 5791k , agrees well with our irfm temperature of 5797k , but as discussed by nissen et al .",
    ", there may be systematic errors in the balmer - line temperatures related to the temperature structures of model atmospheres , non - lte effects , and line - broadening theory . for 10 halo stars having @xmath67 from both h@xmath53 and h@xmath71 ,",
    "the h@xmath71 temperatures are systematically higher than those from h@xmath53 by @xmath74k .",
    "this suggests that the spectroscopic @xmath13-scale is uncertain by approximately @xmath75k .",
    "furthermore , for a sample of 30 metal - poor halo stars , @xcite compared their irfm temperatures with those derived from the hydrogen lines by @xcite and @xcite . as seen in their fig .",
    "12 , there is good agreement between the two scales at @xmath76k , whereas the irfm temperatures tend to be higher by 50 to 100k at @xmath77k . in summary , we conclude that there is no evidence from the presently available spectroscopic temperatures of halo stars that the @xcite irfm scale is too low , but it may be 50100k too high for metal - poor halo stars in the turnoff region .",
    "surface gravities are derived from the standard relation @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the mass of the star and @xmath80 is the absolute bolometric magnitude ( see   [ sec : ages ] ) . from the errors , which are estimated to be @xmath81 in mass , @xmath66k in @xmath67 , and @xmath82 in the bolometric correction , as well as the error of @xmath83 arising from the parallax uncertainty ,",

    "the abundances described in the previous subsections refer to the present compositions of the stellar atmospheres .",

    "if the same corrections are applied to the absolute abundances of all of the metals , the inferred [ @xmath141/fe ] values remain unaffected .",
    "however , since the ages of very metal - poor subgiants , at their observed absolute magnitudes , depend primarily on their absolute oxygen abundances ( see below ) , the adoption of increased [ o / h ] values by 0.10.15 dex does have the effect of reducing the ages derived for them by 0.30.5 gyr , which is not negligible .",
    "that is , the ages of hd132475 and hd140283 that are derived in this study would have been higher by up to 0.5 gyr if the aforementioned adjustments to the observed abundances had not been made .",
    "for the comparisons with observations presented below , stellar models have been computed using the version of the victoria stellar evolution code that has been described in considerable detail by @xcite .",
    "the main differences relative to previous versions ( e.g. , see @xcite ) are the incorporation of the latest rates for the h - burning reactions and a careful treatment of the gravitational settling of helium , along with the implementation of additional mixing below envelope convection zones ( when they are present ) in order to satisfy the solar and  spite plateau \" ( @xcite ) lithium abundance constraints ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "scale in the vicinity of the to . at the locations of hd132475 and hd140283 near the middle of the sgb , the differences between isochrones that allow for the settling of helium , on the one hand , and those that also treat the diffusion of the metals , on the other , will be barely discernible , judging from the comparisons of evolutionary tracks presented by vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2012 , their fig .  1 ) . only in the case of hd84937",
    "will the neglect of metals diffusion be of some concern .",
    "] interestingly , the net effect of these improvements on the to luminosity versus age relations that are applicable to old population ii stars is quite small : the @xmath142% reduction of the to age that occurs when diffusive processes are treated ( @xcite ) is largely offset by a comparable increase of this quantity when recent determinations of the rate of the critical @xmath143n@xmath144o reaction ( @xcite , @xcite ) are adopted in computations of stellar models ( as first reported by @xcite ) .",
    "the physics improvements that have been made have much bigger consequences for the predicted temperatures of stars and the morphologies of their evolutionary tracks than for the dependence of the to luminosity on age .",
    "however , the model effective temperature ( @xmath13 ) scale is subject to many uncertainties ( including , in particular , the treatment of convection and the atmospheric boundary condition ) , and its accuracy can be assessed only through comparisons with empirical determinations . as shown by (",

    "in fact , similar success is obtained on many cmds ( also see @xcite ) if color@xmath13 relations ( @xcite ) based on the latest marcs model atmospheres ( @xcite ) are used to transpose the models to the observational planes .",
    "( the same transformations are used in this study to derive bolometric corrections and colors . )",
    "moreover , @xcite have shown that the same isochrones provide a close match to the shapes of gc cmds from at least @xmath145 mag below the to through to approximately the middle of the subgiant branch ( sgb ) , independently of the assumed age and metallicity ( see their figs .  2 and 3 ) . indeed , this provides an argument that the errors of the predicted to temperatures due to the neglect of metals diffusion ( see footnote 7 ) are probably quite small .",
    "the main _ concern _ with these models is that the predicted locations of cluster rgbs appear to be somewhat too cool / red , but the primary cause of this discrepancy has not yet been identified .",
    "it is possible , for instance , that the assumption of a constant value of the mixing - length parameter , @xmath146 , is at the root of this difficulty , given that calibrations of this parameter using 3d model atmospheres suggest that it should vary somewhat with @xmath13 , @xmath59 , and [ fe / h ] ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "errors in the color transformations and the treatment of the surface boundary condition could also be contributing factors . indeed , we suspect that it will be difficult to resolve this issue as long as the uncertainties associated with the derived temperatures and metallicities of metal - poor giants ( in the field or in star clusters ) remain as large as they are ( typically @xmath147  k and @xmath1480.2 dex , respectively ) .",
    "worth mentioning is the fact that the aforementioned problem concerning the rgb , which has little or no impact on the ages derived in this study , is not unique to models that are generated using the victoria code .",
    "as shown by @xcite , evolutionary tracks from the zero - age main sequence to the rgb tip ( and such properties as the helium core mass at core helium ignition ) are in excellent agreement with those obtained using the completely independent , very versatile mesa program ( @xcite ) , when essentially the same up - to - date physics is assumed .",
    "we note , finally , that new grids of tracks and isochrones ( which will be the subject of a separate paper by d.  vandenberg et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) are used in the following analysis . whereas the models used by @xcite to derive our initial estimate of the age of hd140283 assumed the solar mix of the metals given by @xcite , with various enhancements to the abundances of the @xmath53-elements ( o , ne , mg , etc . ) and then scaled to the observed [ fe / h ] value , the newly computed models assume the solar metal abundances given by @xcite as the base mixture . at low metallicities , the abundances of all of the @xmath53-elements , except oxygen ,",
    "are assumed to be enhanced by the fixed amount of 0.4 dex ( i.e. , [ @xmath141/fe ] @xmath149 ) .",
    "however , because to luminosity versus age relations are such a strong function of the oxygen abundance , which is subject to considerable uncertainties and which appears to vary to some extent from star - to - star ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and possibly from cluster - to - cluster , separate grids of models have been computed for [ o / fe ] @xmath150 and 1.0 . moreover , to address possible helium abundance variations , grids of evolutionary tracks have also been computed for helium mass - fraction abundances @xmath151 and 0.285 ( for each assumed metallicity ) .",
    "fully consistent low- and high - temperature opacities for each chemical mixture have been used in the model computations .",
    "as described by @xcite , the software developed by p.  bergbusch permits simultaneous interpolations in three chemical abundance parameters ( [ fe / h ] , @xmath152 , and either [ @xmath53/fe ] , if the abundances of all of the @xmath53-elements vary together , or [ o / fe ] , if a constant [ @xmath141/fe ] value is assumed for the heavier @xmath53-elements ) . as a result",
    ", we have the capability to generate isochrones for very close to the preferred chemical abundances .",
    "while there will still be small differences between the assumed and actual [ @xmath141/fe ] values for many of the metals , the effects of such differences on isochrones that are applicable to low - metallicity stars are of little consequence ( see below ) .",
    "what is important is that we are able to treat [ fe / h ] , [ o / fe ] , and @xmath152 as free parameters .",

    "irrespective of whether or not the statistical lutz - kelker corrections ( @xcite ) _ should _ be applied , they are negligible for the subgiants in our sample because of the high precision of our parallax determinations ( @xmath157 ) . for instance , using an equation provided by @xcite , these corrections amount to only @xmath158 mag or less ( in an absolute sense ) .",
    "consequently , they have not been included in the tabulated absolute magnitudes .",
    "the main reason why hd19445 has been included in this plot is to demonstrate that isochrones satisfy the @xmath13  constraint provided by this star very well ( as in the case of local subdwarfs of higher metallicity ; see vandenberg et al .",
    "2010 , 2014 ) .",
    "for the sake of clarity , only a small segment of a 12.5 gyr isochrone for the metallicity of hd19445 has been plotted . clearly , an appreciably older or younger isochrone would have served our purposes just as well given the fairly large uncertainties in the properties of hd19445 and the small separations between isochrones of different age at @xmath159 .",
    "faint subdwarfs provide good tests of the predictions of stellar models and they represent one of the favored standard candles for distance determinations precisely because their properties are nearly independent of age .",
    "hd84937 appears to be just beginning its sgb evolution , and in fact , it is more correctly described as a to star . at the location of hd84937 , isochrones for its observed metal abundances are more vertical than horizontal ; consequently , the uncertainty of its age is due mostly to the uncertainty associated with its @xmath13  rather than that of its @xmath36 .",
    "according to the interpolation results given in table  [ tab : tab6 ] , the age of hd84937 is 12.09 gyr , with uncertainties of @xmath160 gyr and @xmath161 gyr from the vertical and horizontal error bars , respectively .",
    "the actual uncertainty will be larger than this since , in particular , the model @xmath13 scale is uncertain by at least @xmath162 , which is the horizontal shift in the isochrones that is permitted by the @xmath35 error bars of hd19445 .",
    "( a further complication is the possibility that we have underestimated the effects of gravitational settling on the surface abundances of hd84937 , which would also impact the inferred age . ) by comparison , the _ hipparcos _ parallax , @xmath163 mas ( @xcite ) , which implies @xmath164 , would have placed this star right at the turnoff of the 12.5 gyr isochrone for its metallicity .",
    "( note that the tabulated masses were used to calculate the gravities which are listed in table  [ tab : tab4 ] using equation 1 . )",
    "similar interpolations in isochrones computed for the measured abundances of hd140283 yield an age of 14.27 gyr , with the vertical and horizontal error bars implying age uncertainties of @xmath165 gyr and @xmath166 gyr , respectively ( see table  [ tab : tab6 ] ) .",
    "because the sgb has a relatively shallow slope , the consequences of the @xmath13  uncertainty for the inferred age is much less of a concern than in the case of hd84937 , and indeed , the parallax ( and hence @xmath36 ) uncertainty is the larger of these two contributors to the error budget by just a small amount .",
    "thus , despite carrying out a new spectroscopic study of hd140283 and using new sets of stellar models , the age of this star differs only slightly from the determination of @xmath167 gyr reported by @xcite .",
    "this is not too surprising , however , since the values of [ fe / h ] and [ o / fe ] which have been derived in this investigation are quite similar to those adopted by bond et al . , and it is to be expected that the effects of small metal abundance differences in the respective isochrones will be of little consequence as long as nearly the same _ absolute _ oxygen abundance is assumed . this claim is supported by the isochrone comparisons presented in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .    in the uppermost panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] , the models assume the same helium and oxygen abundances ( @xmath168 , [ o / h ] @xmath169 ) , but different metallicities by @xmath170[fe / h ] @xmath171 dex ( and hence different values of [ o / fe ] by the same amount ) .",
    "since the [ fe / h ] value represents the factor used to scale the @xmath172 abundances of all of the metals from the assumed solar mixture ( with the adopted @xmath53-element abundance enhancements taken into account ) to the metallicity of interest , _ all _ of the metals other than oxygen have higher absolute abundances by 0.2 dex in the [ fe / h ] @xmath173 isochrones than in those for [ fe / h ] @xmath174 . despite this difference ,",
    "the _ solid _ and _ dashed _ isochrones for an age of 14.0 gyr have virtually identical to luminosities ; i.e. , with a suitable horizontal shift of either of these two isochrones , they would overlay each other nearly exactly in the vicinity of the turnoff ( and elsewhere , in fact ) .",
    "however , in this study , temperature differences are important , and the slight shift to cooler temperatures that is predicted to occur when the abundances of the metals are increased will have some consequences for the inferred age of hd140283 . judging from the separation between the 13.5 and 14.0 gyr isochrones that have been plotted as",
    "_ solid curves _ , a 0.2 dex error in _ all _ of the derived metal abundances ( at constant [ o / fe ] ) would change the derived age by about 0.2 gyr : the lower the [ fe / h ] value , the higher the age .",
    "( we chose not to plot isochrones for the specific initial abundances and age that we have determined for this star , as the clarity of the figure was improved by having the model loci slightly offset from the position of hd140283 . )    the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] demonstrates that helium abundance uncertainties have no significant impact on the age of hd140283 due to its fortuitous location close to the center of the sgb , where isochrones of the same age and metal abundances , but different @xmath152 , are virtually coincident .",
    "it is a well - known result ( e.g. , see @xcite ; @xcite ) that , at least at low metallicities , helium has only a small effect on the slope of the subgiant branch ( at a fixed age ) , but not on the luminosity near the middle of the sgb .",
    "the fact that the helium abundance does not play a role in the ages of hd140283 thus removes from consideration a parameter ( @xmath152 ) that is very difficult to measure in population ii stars , and which is known to vary within some gcs ( e.g. , ngc2808 ; see @xcite ) , possibly from cluster - to - cluster , and perhaps among field halo stars as well .    in the bottom panel ,",
    "the strong dependence of age on the oxygen abundance is illustrated . in this comparison ,",

    "the implied age of hd140283 would decrease to 14.0 gyr and an age of @xmath17813.6 gyr would be contained within the @xmath35 error bars .",
    "it is certainly well within the realm of possibility that the model temperatures are somewhat too high , which may ultimately turn out to be the main reason why our current best estimate of the age of this star is greater than the age of the universe by @xmath5 gyr . at this point in time",
    ", we simply do not have any compelling , independent evidence that the isochrones are too hot .",
    "regardless , hd140283 is clearly a very old star that must have formed soon after the big bang .",
    "the age of the last of the three subgiants in our sample , hd132475 , for which we have derived _ initial _ abundances corresponding to [ fe / h ] @xmath179 and [ o / fe ] @xmath180 , is @xmath181 gyr ( see figure  [ fig : fig3 ] and table  [ tab : tab6 ] ) .",
    "this error bar takes into account only the uncertainties associated with the fgs parallax .",
    "because the sgbs of isochrones for a fixed age have shallower slopes as the metallicity increases , the ramification of the adopted @xmath66  k @xmath13  uncertainty for the age of hd132475 ( @xmath182 gyr , which is less than that due to the @xmath36 uncertainty by a factor of 1.8 ) is considerably smaller than in the case of hd140283 .",
    "these two stars apparently differ in age by @xmath136 gyr .    as discussed by ( * ?",
    "* see their table 1 ) , reasonable estimates of the uncertainties associated with all of the many factors that play a role in the determination of stellar ages ( including , e.g. , the adopted @xmath155 magnitudes , bolometric corrections , reddenings , and chemical abundances ) would imply that the net @xmath35 error bar that should be attached to our age determinations is @xmath183 gyr ( or a little higher in the case of hd84937 ) .",
    "although it seems unlikely that the physics of stellar interiors will undergo significant revisions in the coming years , since opacities ( due mostly to bound - free and free - free processes involving h and he at low metallicities ) and nuclear reaction rates appear to be well determined , improvements to the treatment of convection and the atmospheric boundary condition , among other things , could easily impact the model temperature scale at the level of @xmath1840.01 .",
    "because such variations are comparable to current uncertainties in the empirical @xmath13 scale , especially if errors in [ fe / h ] are also taken into account , it will be difficult to advance our understanding of this aspect of stellar models until the observational constraints are tightened considerably .",

    "10 ) quite well .",
    "obviously , something is awry and , in the next subsection , we try to resolve this dilemma .    before doing that , a few remarks are in order concerning the right - hand panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] .",
    "our estimate of the _ initial _ iron abundance of hd132475 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath198 ) is well within the uncertainties of many determinations of the metallicity of m5 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , [ o / fe ] @xmath1490.6 is generally found in gc stars that constitute the high oxygen end of the o  na anticorrelation ( including members of m5 ; see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since the sgb of m5 has little vertical scatter , the total c@xmath199n@xmath199o abundance must be nearly constant , in which case , the low [ o / fe ] values that are also found in most clusters arose from deep mixing along the upper rgb ( e.g. , @xcite ) and/or the gas out of which the current stars formed had previously undergone different amounts of cno - processing , perhaps in the agb stars from a slightly earlier stellar generation ( e.g. , @xcite ) or in a primordial supermassive star ( @xcite ) . in any case , m5 appears to be chemically quite similar to hd132475 , and if the latter is used to determine the distance modulus of the former , one obtains @xmath200 .",
    "( as in the case of m92 , stetson s  photometric standard fields \" photometry of m5 has been plotted , the reddening is from sf11 , and the source of the johnson - cousins @xmath201 data for hd132475 is @xcite . )    assuming the standard value of @xmath156 , the true distance modulus of m5 is 14.24 , which agrees quite well with the value of @xmath202 that was obtained by @xcite from a fit of a zahb to the cluster horizontal branch stars .",
    "however , the latter adopted [ fe / h ] @xmath203 ( @xcite ) for m5 : the assumption of [ fe / h ] @xmath179 would have resulted in a larger modulus by a few hundredths of magnitude . still , the two independent ways of deriving the distance yield reasonably consistent results , in contrast with our findings in the case of m92 , when hd140283 is used as a standard candle .",
    "we now turn to an investigation of this problem , though we will return to a consideration of m5 afterwards .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] plots the same 14.0 gyr isochrone that appeared in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , but on the @xmath204$]-plane . on this cmd ,",
    "the inferred age of hd140283 is about 0.30 gyr younger than our best estimate from the @xmath0-diagram , though virtually the same age that was derived in ",
    "[ sec : ages ] is implied by both the @xmath37 and @xmath205 colors of hd140283 ( not shown ) . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "whose color@xmath13 relations are used throughout this investigation , uncertainties in the zero - points of the transformations at the level of 0.010.015 mag are easily possible ( for any color index ) .",
    "alternatively , it may be the observed @xmath50 color of hd140283 that is anomalously too blue by a small amount ( for whatever reason ) .",
    "this is a moot point . what _ is _ troubling is that the fit of a fully consistent zahb to the cluster counterpart in m92 yields an apparent distance modulus , @xmath206 , that is 0.22 mag higher than the value which is obtained by matching the cluster cmd to hd140283 ( see the previous figure ) .",
    "if the shorter modulus is adopted , not only would the cluster hb stars be fainter than our zahb models ( which , as already mentioned , do a good job of satisfying empirical rr lyrae luminosity constraints ; see @xcite ) , but the cluster main sequence ( ms ) would be much fainter , at a given color , than the ms portion of the isochrone for [ fe / h ] @xmath207 that has been plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "this is problematic because the separations between isochrones for low metallicities are predicted to be quite small at @xmath159 on the @xmath208 plane ( see vandenberg et al .",
    "2010 , their fig .",
    "these difficulties are almost certainly telling us that m92 and hd140283 can not have the same age  the field halo subgiant must be older  and perhaps even that they are chemically dissimilar . to examine the implications of possible age and chemical abundance differences , we have opted to fit isochrones and zahb loci to the @xmath209 photometry that was obtained by @xcite using the acs ( advanced camera for surveys ) on the _ hubble space telescope_. (",
    "the same data were recently used in the determination of the ages of 55 of the gcs in their sample by @xcite . )",
    "the main reason for this choice is that a deeper and tighter cmd for m92 can be derived from this archive than from any other publicly available source .",
    "in addition , since we intend to carry out similar fits of stellar models to the cmd of m5 , it is an important advantage of using the sarajedini et al .",
    "observations that they represent a very homogeneous data set .",
    "suppose the zahb - based distance is the correct one and that m92 and hd140283 are chemically indistinguishable . as shown in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : fig6 ] , a 12.20 gyr isochrone for the derived _ initial _ abundances of hd140283 provides quite a good match to the ms and to of m92 , aside from being slightly too red ( by only @xmath210 mag ) .",
    "to make this age determination , isochrones for different ages were adjusted in the horizontal direction by whatever amount was needed in order to match the turnoff color : the one that provided the best fit to the cluster stars from @xmath20 mag below the to to @xmath211 mag above it was taken to be the best estimate of the turnoff age . a thorough discussion and justification of this procedure is provided by @xcite , who obtained a higher age by about 0.5 gyr because the models that they employed assumed slightly lower values of [ fe / h ] and [ o / fe ] and their zahb models yielded a smaller distance modulus by 0.03 mag ( which , by itself , accounts for about a 0.3 gyr age difference ) .",
    "if m92 has the same [ fe / h ] as hd140283 , but a somewhat lower oxygen abundance ( say , [ o / fe ] @xmath212 instead of @xmath213 ) , the same distance modulus is obtained , but the predicted age increases to @xmath214 gyr ( see panel b ) .",
    "this isochrone also follows along the red edge of the cluster cmd . to obtain an age near 13.0 gyr",
    ", the models would need to assume [ o / fe ] @xmath215 .",
    "note that the zahb for higher [ o / fe ] extends to redder colors . in these and",
    "all similar plots presented in this paper , the mass of the reddest zahb model is identical to the mass at the tip of the rgb that is predicted by the isochrone which is fitted to the turnoff photometry , without taking any mass loss whatsoever into account .",
    "the intrinsic color of the reddest zahb star in m92 appears to be @xmath216 . at this color , the zahb models shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) have masses of 0.730 and 0.748 @xmath217 , respectively , whereas the corresponding rgb tip ( and to ) masses are 0.790 and 0.797 @xmath217 .",
    "thus , relatively little mass loss appears to be necessary to explain the reddest zahb stars in m92 , though @xmath218 must be lost to explain the bluest stars ( assuming that mass loss is the primary cause of the dispersion in color along the hb ) .",
    "the decreased importance of mass loss , compared with the predictions of older models , is one of the consequences of the reduced rate of the @xmath143n@xmath144o reaction ( @xcite ) .",
    "as shown by @xcite , this revision causes a zahb model for a fixed mass and chemical abundances to be shifted to significantly higher temperatures  an effect that is especially noticeable at low metal abundances .",
    "the small offset between the predicted and observed ms and to colors that are apparent in panels ( a ) and ( b ) can be eliminated if models for either a slightly higher helium abundance ( @xmath219 instead of 0.250 ) or a somewhat lower metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath220 rather than @xmath221 ) are overlaid onto the observed cmd ( see panels c and d ) . to be sure ,",
    "@xmath13 , color , and other uncertainties are large enough that this is no more than suggestive .",
    "still , the improved agreement leads one to wonder if @xcite generally found it necessary to shift isochrone ( but not zahb ) colors to the blue by typically @xmath222 in their large survey of gc ages because they adopted helium abundances that were too low , or more likely , [ fe / h ] values that were too high .",
    "although @xmath223 is within current uncertainties of recent determinations of the primordial abundance ( @xmath224 ; @xcite ) , it is possible that a somewhat larger value is more appropriate for population ii stars  perhaps especially those found in gcs , since some processing of the gas through the agb stars of an earlier stellar generation ( see , e.g. , gratton et al .",
    "2012 ) or via an initial supermassive star ( @xcite ) is suggested by the chemical abundance variations found in them .",
    "insofar as the possibility that m92 has [ fe / h ] @xmath225 is concerned , we note that @xcite have obtained [ fe / h ] @xmath226 from a spectroscopic analysis of 19 of its red giants .",
    "similar investigations by @xcite and @xcite have yielded [ fe / h ] @xmath227 for m15 , which has generally been found to have nearly the same iron abundance as m92 ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . according to roederer & sneden ( also see sobeck et al . ) the 0.3 dex larger [ fe / h ] values that some of the same investigators had obtained previously for both clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) are due to differences in the atomic data , the adopted model atmosphere grids , and the treatment of rayleigh scattering .",
    "additional support for a reduced metallicity is provided in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] , which compares the relative locations of the m92 rgb and the very metal - deficient field giant hd122563 ( @xmath228 mas from _ hipparcos _ ; @xcite ) on the @xmath229$]-diagram .",
    "hd122563 has measured [ fe / h ] values that range from @xmath230 to @xmath231 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and it seems to have normal @xmath53-element and oxygen abundances for its metallicity ( [ @xmath53/fe ] @xmath232 , @xcite ; [ o / fe ] @xmath233 @xcite ) ; consequently , it should lie on the _ blue _ side of the cluster giant branch if m92 has , e.g. , [ fe / h ] @xmath234 ( @xcite ) .    if @xmath205 colors are plotted instead of @xmath37 , the resultant comparison ( not shown ) looks qualitatively nearly identical .",
    "( photometry for hd122563 has been taken from the studies by @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "the main advantage of examining bv observations is that @xmath37 colors are considerably more sensitive than @xmath205 to metallicity differences at low [ fe / h ] values . whereas the 12 gyr isochrones for [ fe / h ] @xmath235 , and @xmath236 that have been plotted",
    "are clearly separated from one another , they are nearly coincident on the @xmath237$]-diagram .",
    "why hd122563 is offset by such a large amount from m92 giants , at the same color or at the same luminosity , is not known , but it may be that its measured parallax , which has a fairly large uncertainty , is too high .",
    "consistency with m92 ( if the latter has [ fe / h ] @xmath227 ) would be obtained if the correct parallax of hd122563 were @xmath238 mas , which is just within the @xmath101 error bar of the _ hipparcos _ value .",
    "based on the available evidence , we are inclined to adopt [ fe / h ] @xmath239 for m92 .",
    "the error bar encompasses earlier spectroscopic determinations near @xmath240 by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , and recent values @xmath227 that have been either derived for m92 ( @xcite ) or implied by studies of m15 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and hd122563 ( as discussed above ) .",
    "if m92 has [ fe / h ] @xmath241 , it would need to have [ o / fe ] @xmath242 in order for our zahb models to provide a satisfactory match to the red end of the cluster hb .",
    "as shown in panel ( d ) of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig6 ] , the zahb model for a mass that is equal to the to mass of the best - fit isochrone is predicted to have @xmath243 , which is just barely compatible with the cluster hb ( assuming that the few hb stars with redder colors are evolved stars since they tend to be brighter than a zahb ; see the other panels ) .",
    "the adoption of a lower metallicity would imply an even bluer zahb unless a higher absolute oxygen abundance is assumed : higher [ o / h ] values imply younger ages at a given to luminosity .",
    "our analysis suggests that m92 is younger than 13 gyr , and it may even be younger than 12 gyr if its stars have a very high oxygen abundance . pending further advances in our understanding , an age near 12.5 gyr is our current best estimate .",
    "thus the subgiants in m92 appear to be different from the field subgiant , hd140283 , in having both a younger age and ( probably ) a lower [ fe / h ] value .    before briefly considering the rr lyrae constraint on cluster distances ,",
    "the distance and age of m5 will be derived from fits of isochrones and zahbs to its cmd .      as in the case of m92",
    ", one could produce many different fits of stellar models to the cmd of m5 given current uncertainties in [ fe / h ] , [ o / fe ] , and @xmath152 , as well as those associated with the cluster distance and reddening .",
    "we have chosen to present just two of them .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure [ fig : fig8 ] shows that a zahb for essentially the derived abundances of hd132475 yields an apparent modulus of 14.43 mag , if @xmath244 ( from sf11 ) , which implies a to age of @xmath245 gyr .",
    "the zahb - based true distance modulus is thus @xmath246 mag larger than that inferred from hd132475 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] )  a difference that is slightly larger than the @xmath101 error bar on the @xmath36 of the field subgiant .",
    "indeed , this explains why the ages that have been determined for m5 and hd132475 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) differ by about 1 gyr . [ @xcite also obtained an age of 11.5 gyr for m5 using models that assumed the solar abundances given by @xcite as the base mixture , with suitably enhanced @xmath53-element abundances , and then scaled to [ fe / h ] @xmath203 ( @xcite ) . although they found a smaller modulus by about 0.05 mag , compared with our estimate , the effects on the age of adopting slightly larger values of [ fe / h ] and [ o / h ] in their study compensates almost exactly for this difference . ]",
    "the main difficulty with the fit to the observations in the left - hand panel is that the predicted colors for the ms and to are too red ( though by only 0.010.015 mag , which is well within the color uncertainties ) .",
    "as suggested in the previous subsection , this discrepancy may be telling us that the adopted [ fe / h ] value is too high .",
    "the right - hand panel shows that the best - fit isochrone for [ fe / h ] @xmath247 reproduces the ms and to photometry of m5 very well without requiring any horizontal offset .",
    "( this is obviously not a compelling argument for a reduced [ fe / h ] value , but neither can one rule out this possibility given current uncertainties in metal abundance determinations . ) not unexpectedly , the same age , to within the small fitting uncertainties , is obtained because both the zahb and the to luminosity at a given age become brighter as the [ fe / h ] value is reduced ( though not at identical rates ) .",
    "however , we can make use of an additional constraint to shed some light on this issue ; namely , subdwarfs in the solar neighborhood with [ fe / h ] values similar to that of m5 ( and hd132475 ) that also have well determined parallaxes from _ hipparcos_. in figure  [ fig : fig9 ] , all of the subdwarfs that we have been able to identify with @xmath248 , @xmath249 ( @xcite ) , and [ fe / h ] values within @xmath96 dex of our determination for hd132475 have been superimposed onto the cmd of m5 .",
    "for the latter , we have adopted @xmath244 ( from sf11 ) and two different values of the apparent distance modulus .",
    "the higher value , @xmath250 ( left - hand panel ) , implies the same true distance modulus as in the left - hand panel of the previous figure when the differences in @xmath251 and @xmath252 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) are taken into account .",
    "the lower value , @xmath253 ( right - hand panel ) is obtained when the cmd of m5 is fitted to hd132475 ( recall fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "the [ fe / h ] values , the photometry , and the adopted reddenings of the subdwarfs have all been taken from the study by @xcite , while the m5 observations are the same as those employed in the analysis of the marcs color@xmath13 relations by @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the mean [ fe / h ] value of the six subdwarfs that satisfied our criteria is idential to the value that we have derived for hd132475 ( i.e. , @xmath254 ) .",
    "( due to diffusive effects , the initial [ fe / h ] values are expected to be larger than the observed values by @xmath255 dex ; recall the discussion in   [ subsec : initial ] . ) small blueward or redward color offsets ( @xmath256 mag ) were applied to the subdwarf colors , as necessary , to compensate for the effects of differences between the observed and mean metallicities .",
    "these corrections were based on the differences in the predicted colors , at the subdwarf @xmath36 values , of isochrones for the observed range in [ fe / h ] .",
    "lutz - kelker corrections have not been applied to the absolute magnitudes of the subdwarfs : they are , in any case , quite small ( 0.030.05 mag for the two brightest stars , @xmath257 mag for the others ) .    effectively , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] is telling us that the apparent distance modulus of m5 , as derived from fits of the cluster main - sequence to the sample of subdwarf calibrators that we have considered is approximately @xmath258 .",
    "( although not shown , the adoption of a value as low as 14.30 or as high as 14.50 causes obvious discrepancies between the subdwarfs and the m5 cmd . )",
    "while a common age for m5 and hd132475 is within the uncertainties of the subdwarf - based distance ( see the right - hand panel ) , distance moduli based on rr lyrae stars tend to favor values of @xmath259 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , and because the modulus based on our zahb models is within the uncertainties of the values derived from the subdwarf and rr lyrae standard candles ( see the next section ) , we consider @xmath260 to be our  best estimate \" ( rounded to the nearest 0.05 mag ) of the m5 modulus . in this case , m@xmath2615 is predicted to be @xmath262 gyr younger than hd@xmath261132475 .      at the present time , the best empirical determination of the slope of the rr lyrae @xmath36 versus [ fe / h ] relation is @xmath263[fe / h ] @xmath264 by @xcite from their analysis of @xmath265 variables in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . if the true distance modulus of the lmc is 18.50 , which is within the 2% uncertainty of the distance derived from eight long - period eclipsing binary members by @xcite , the mean @xmath155 magnitude of the rr lyraes observed by clementini et al .",

    "values by @xmath276 dex in the case of m15 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and m92 ( @xcite ) .",
    "until such work is carried out , we are inclined to favor [ fe / h ] @xmath277 for m5 , with an error bar that encompasses the determinations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and that allows for the possibility of a somewhat lower value . ] needless to say , it is encouraging to find rather good consistency of these determinations with the empirical results obtained by @xcite and @xcite , to well within their @xmath35 uncertainties , and with those reported by @xcite , to within @xmath278 ( see fig .",

    "as the uncertainties associated with both the rr lyrae and subdwarf standard candles are still rather large , it is easily possible that the distance moduli derived here are too large or too small by several hundredths of a magnitude .",

    "however , the associated @xmath35 error bars overlap .",
    "the most likely explanations for these difficulties , which would impact our results for the other subgiants as well , are ( i ) the absolute oxygen abundance that we have determined is too low , ( ii ) the adopted temperature is too low , ( iii ) the isochrone @xmath13  scale is too high , or some combination of these possibilities .",

    "nevertheless , in view of such implications for broader issues , further work on hd140283 would clearly be worthwhile  including , in particular , an asteroseismic study , which has the potential to yield interesting independent constraints on its radius and age ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "had we neglected the gravitational settling of helium in the stellar models that were compared with hd140283 , the age discrepancies described in the previous point would have been @xmath303 gyr .",
    "thus , models that neglect this physics appear to be ruled out .",
    "moreover , diffusive models must allow for extra mixing just below envelope convection zones in order to obtain _ reasonable _ consistency between the predicted and observed metal abundances of to and lower rgb stars in gcs , and the chemical abundance variations along the sgb .",
    "[ the difference between the observed and initial [ @xmath141/h ] value is not expected to be the same for each metal ( as we have assumed ) given that , e.g. , some species are more affected by radiative acclerations and/or turbulent mixing than others ( see @xcite ) . to test diffusion physics , it is therefore important to compare the measured surface abundances of many elements with those predicted for stars in several evolutionary states .",
    "for instance , @xcite have recently found systematic differences between the observed and predicted metal abundances in stars belonging to the open cluster m67 .",
    "even though such efforts require exceedingly careful and precise work , they should be given strong support .",
    "hd140283 appears to be significantly ( @xmath136 gyr ) older than m92 ( and presumably other gcs of similar metallicities ; see @xcite ) .",
    "if the cluster subgiants that have the same intrinsic color as hd140283 also have the same @xmath36 , the apparent distance modulus of m92 would be @xmath304 . this would be completely at odds with expectations based on ms - fits to local subdwarfs or the application of the rr lyrae standard candle ( or zahb - based distance estimates ) .",
    "hd132475 also appears to be older ( by @xmath20 gyr ) than m5 , which is believed to have similar iron and oxygen abundances .",
    "ages greater than @xmath305 and @xmath245 gyr that have been derived here for m92 and m5 , respectively , would be favored if the gcs have significantly lower oxygen abundances than those found in the two subgiants .",
    "nonetheless , the milky way apparently contains field halo stars that are older than those which currently reside in its gcs .",
    "stellar evolutionary models that satisfy the subdwarf and rr lyrae constraints to within the ( still fairly large ) uncertainties associated with the latter seem to provide the best fits to observed gc cmds if the low metallicity end of the cluster [ fe / h ] scale is shifted to lower values by @xmath2550.15 dex . this possibility is supported by recent spectroscopic work on m92 and its near [ fe / h ] twin m15 , as well as the location of m92 giants relative to that of the field giant hd122563 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath227 ) on the @xmath229$]-diagram .",
    "the parallaxes reported here are likely to be supplanted later this decade by precise results from _ gaia _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , as we have shown , the parallax error is no longer the dominant contributor to the uncertainty in the ages of the three subgiants . in this investigation ,",
    "the error bars associated with chemical abundance determinations and the empirical @xmath13  scale are comparable to or more important than distance scale uncertainties",
    ". that will continue to be the case in the coming era when accurate distances have been measured for vast numbers of stars in the extended solar neighborhood .",
    "we thank marcio catelan for providing the mean apparent magnitudes of the rr lyraes in m5 and m92 that have been used in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] , and volker bromm for helpful comments concerning the early chemical evolution of the universe as well as a few pertinent references .",
