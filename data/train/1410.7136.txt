    "the cav@xmath0o@xmath1 compound was studied both theoretically and experimentally owing to its low - dimensional magnetism and frustrated structure  @xcite . the high temperature orthorhombic phase ( the space group @xmath3 ) undergoes the phase transition into low temperature monoclinic phase ( the space group @xmath4 ) at t@xmath5 k. the main motif of both structures is zigzag double chains of edge - sharing vo@xmath2 octahedra ( see figure  [ cavo_str ] ) . the distances between nearest and next - nearest v neighbors are nearly equal , which together with the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) type of interactions gives rise to the geometrical frustration .",
    "the electronic configuration of v@xmath6 is 3@xmath7 , making cav@xmath0o@xmath1 the appropriate compound for investigation of s=1 quasi - one - dimensional magnetism .",
    "cav@xmath0o@xmath1 has two crystallographically inequivalent types of vanadium atoms , v1 and v2 , forming the zigzag chains .",
    "the vanadium atoms are displaced out of the center of octahedra ( figure  1 of supplemetary material avaliable at  @xcite ) , yielding the existence of finite electric dipoles .",
    "however , both structures possess the inversion symmetry , meaning that the dipoles are ordered antiferroelectrically .",
    "each zigzag chain propagates along the @xmath8 axis and has two neighboring chains of other type , which are stacked along @xmath9 and @xmath10 axes ( see figures  [ cavo_str](b ) and [ cavo_str](c ) , respectively ) .",
    "each vanadium atom has six nearest vanadium neighbors forming six main exchange paths ( the notations of corresponding interatomic distances are given in the brackets ) : @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) - along the `` leg '' of the chain formed by v1 and v2 , respectively ; @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) - along the zigzag in the positive and negative direction of @xmath8 ( denoted by `` @xmath23 '' and `` @xmath24 '' , respectively ) ; and two groups of interchain interactions along @xmath9 and @xmath10 : ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , respectively ( see figure  [ cavo_str ] ) .    the magnetic structure of cav@xmath0o@xmath1 have been studied already in 70 s  @xcite but it was impossible in that time to resolve the low temperature monoclinic crystal structure and analyze correctly experimental data .",
    "it is well known that below t@xmath2951 - 78 k the long range antiferromagnetic order with a propagation vector @xmath30 sets in  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of magnetic moment @xmath31 was detected in @xmath32v nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements , muon - spin spectroscopy investigations and powder diffraction  @xcite .",
    "the collinear spin orientation was found in the first neutron powder diffraction experiments at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "however , it was questioned in more recent nmr measurements  @xcite and neutron diffraction experiments on high quality single crystals  @xcite , which suggest some noncollinear spin arrangement .",
    "since the distances in the leg @xmath33 are nearly the same as in the zigzag @xmath34 ( see figure  [ cavo_str ] ) one could naively expect nearly equal exchange interactions @xmath35 .",
    "however , the high - temperature dc susceptibility measurements of cav@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystals reveal that above t@xmath36 the system behaves like a s=1 heisenberg chain  @xcite . in order to explain this fact",
    ", it was typically assumed that ( i ) the zigzag chains , formed by v1 and v2 , are nearly equivalent ; and ( ii ) three @xmath37 orbitals of vanadium sites are oriented in such a way that their lobes are parallel to @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , giving rise to the exchange paths @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , respectively ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the notations of  @xcite ) .    in the orthorhombic phase , the lowest @xmath37 orbital was supposed to be occupied by one electron , while the second electron resides on a double degenerate level  @xcite .",
    "the direct overlap of the first orbitals leads to the strong afm interaction along the leg ( @xmath41 ) , while the interactions in the zigzag are identical ( @xmath42=@xmath43 ) and should be considerably weaker than @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the system in the orthorhombic phase could be considered as a s=1 haldane chain .",
    "this scenario was supported by results of exact diagonalization calculations , supplemented with the fitting of the experimental high - temperature susceptibility data , which yield @xmath47@xmath48 mev and @xmath49@xmath50 mev  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the same work  @xcite , yet another scenario was proposed with @xmath49@xmath51 mev and @xmath47@xmath52 mev , which equally well fits the experimental data . in both cases , the fitting yields",
    "the curie temperature @xmath53@xmath54 k and the effective magnetic moment @xmath55  @xcite .    under the transition to the monoclinic phase ,",
    "the additional distortions of the vo@xmath2 octahedra completely lifts the degeneracy of @xmath37 orbitals and make all the exchange paths inequivalent .",
    "moreover , two @xmath37 orbitals are supposed to be occupied and one orbital is empty , that should lead to the inequality @xmath56 .",
    "such magnetic structure with the strong exchange couplings along the leg and every second interaction along the zigzag corresponds to the spin-1 ladder .",
    "the above scenario was based solely on the qualitative structural consideration without taking into account the existence of two nonequivalent types of vanadium atoms .",
    "moreover , the assumed type of the orbital ordering was purely empirical and had no proper link to details of the crystal structure . in the present work we report theoretical investigation of electronic structure , orbital ordering and exchange interactions in cav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "for this purpose we construct the realistic low - energy model and derive parameters of this model from the first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "then we solve the model and obtain parameters of interatomic exchange interactions .",
    "the calculated values of exchange integrals are analyzed within superexchange theory .",
    "the spin model with the calculated exchange parameters was solved by quantum monte - carlo method in order to compare theoretical results with the experimental magnetic susceptibility .",
    "in order to analyze the electronic and magnetic properties of cav@xmath0o@xmath1 we employ the previously developed method of `` realistic modeling '' ( see  @xcite for a review ) . the same approach has been performed for the theoretical investigation of related quasi - one - dimensional compound nav@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "first , the band structure of cav@xmath0o@xmath1 was calculated in the local density approximation ( lda ) . the total and partial densities of states ( dos ) for the monoclinic phase are shown in figure  [ cavo_dos ] .",
    "the bands located near the fermi level have v-@xmath37 character .",
    "therefore , we consider the behavior of only these low - energy bands and construct for them hubbard - type model .",
    "all parameters of this model can be derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations in the wannier basis .",
    "all computational details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "most of calculations reported in this work are performed for the experimental monoclinic @xmath4 structure ( unless it is specified otherwise ) .",
    "we use the data from  @xcite , but transform them to the conventional setting with the unique axis @xmath8 and monoclinic angle @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding lattice parameters are @xmath58   , @xmath59   , @xmath60    and @xmath61 , and all atomic coordinates are summarized in supplementary material avaliable at  @xcite .    to construct the model one needs to specify the three sets of parameters , namely , the crystal field ( cf ) , transfer integrals , and screened coulomb interactions .",
    "the cf splitting of the three @xmath37 levels for the orthorhombic and monoclinic structures is shown in figure  [ cavo_cf ] .",
    "the relative position of atomic @xmath37 levels in the orthorhombic phase is ( 0 , 67 , 189 ) mev and ( 0 , 143 , 144 ) mev , while in the monoclinic phase it is ( 0 , 75 , 181 ) mev for v1 and ( 0 , 103 , 175 ) mev for v1 and v2 , respectively .",

    "small structural distortions can lead to the significant changes in the orbital ordering and magnetic properties of such compounds . in the monoclinic cav@xmath0o@xmath1 , there are two @xmath66 electrons occupying the two lowest orbitals @xmath67 and @xmath68 . by neglecting for a while small off - centering of the vanadium ions , all vo@xmath2 octahedra are compressed along the shortest v - o - v distance , which can be denoted as local @xmath69 axis and , for v1 , almost coincides with the crystallographic @xmath9 axis .",
    "then , the orbital with @xmath70 symmetry should be the lowest in energy .",
    "indeed all @xmath67 orbitals have predominantly @xmath70 character in agreement with these simple structural consideration ( see figure  [ mono_orb ] ) .",
    "the lobes of the @xmath67 orbitals on the neighboring v ions in the @xmath8 direction are pointed along the leg of the zigzag chain .",

    "as expected , the largest transfer integrals operate between @xmath76 orbitals in the legs of the zigzag chains ( @xmath77@xmath78 and @xmath24@xmath79 mev for the chains formed by v1 and v2 , respectively ) .",
    "the transfer integrals between the chains are weaker , but comparable with the intrachain ones . thus , despite the quasi - one - dimensional character of the crystal structure , the transfer integrals in cav@xmath0o@xmath1 are essentially three dimensional .",

    "first we apply constrained lda to take into account the screening of atomic orbitals .",
    "then the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) was employed to take into account the self - screening by the same 3@xmath66-electrons which participate in the formation of other bands due to the hybridization effects .",
    "the fitting of screened interactions in terms of two kanamori parameters  @xcite results in the following values of the intraorbital coulomb interaction @xmath80=3.42 ( 3.46 ) ev and the intraatomic exchange coupling @xmath81=0.63 ( 0.64 ) ev for v1 ( v2 ) .",
    "first , we solve the obtained low - energy electron model in the mean - field hartree - fock approximation . for these purpose , we consider four collinear magnetic configurations , two of which , afm2 and afm3 , was reported to be in moderate agreement with the single crystal neutron diffraction data ( see figures 5.29(a ) and 5.29(b ) in  @xcite ) .",
    "the unit cell was doubled along the @xmath8 axis in order to arrange the v spin moments antiferromagnetically as was detected in the single - crystal neutron diffraction experiments  @xcite .",

    "this result is totally consistent with direct hartree - fock calculations , where the afm3 state was found to have the lowest energy .    in order to get some insight into microscopic origin of exchange interactions",
    ", one can also estimate the parameters in the superexchange approximation , starting from the atomic limit and considering virtual hoppings to the neighboring sites in the first order of @xmath95  @xcite .",

    "o-@xmath102 and v-@xmath37 bands are separated by the large energy gap ( see figure  [ cavo_dos ] ) , we consider only the interactions caused by effective transfer integrals @xmath73 and neglect the direct contribution of the oxygen states . in the case of cav@xmath0o@xmath1 , there are two electrons residing on six spin - orbitals of @xmath37 symmetry .",
    "therefore , in the atomic limit , two majority - spin orbitals @xmath76 and @xmath103 are occupied and all other orbitals ( such as majority - spin @xmath104 and all minority - spin orbitals ) are empty .",
    "then , taking into account that the hoppings are allowed only between orbitals with the same spin , we will have : @xmath105 and @xmath106    using the values of transfer integrals , collected in table iii and iv of supplementary material avaliable at  @xcite ( note also that @xmath107 ) as well as the parameters of on - site coulomb ( @xmath80 ) and exchange ( @xmath81 ) interactions , one can obtain that for the leg of the v1 chain : @xmath108@xmath109 mev and @xmath110@xmath111 mev .",
    "therefore , @xmath112 in the superexchange approximation can be estimated as @xmath113@xmath114 mev , which is in excellent agreement with @xmath115@xmath116 mev , obtained using the theory of infinitesimal spin rotations .",
    "for the v2 chain we obtain : @xmath108@xmath117 mev and @xmath110@xmath118 mev , which yield @xmath119@xmath120 mev , being also in good agreement with @xmath121@xmath122 mev , derived from the theory of infinitesimal spin rotations .",
    "hence the difference between the leading exchange integrals for two nonequivalent types of vanadium reflects the behavior of transfer integrals .",
    "the analysis for other bonds @xmath99 can be performed in a similar way ( details can be found in supplementary material avaliable at  @xcite ) . in general , we obtain a good agreement between results of the superexchange theory and the one of the infinitesimal spin rotations .",
    "the experimental estimations of the exchange interactions in cav@xmath0o@xmath1 have been performed in two ways . on the one hand ,",
    "the high temperature susceptibility data have been fitted using s=1 chain model with the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor interactions . in notations of our paper",
    ", they corresponds to @xmath123 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the solution of this model using the exact diagonalization method leads to the @xmath124@xmath125 mev and @xmath126=0  @xcite , which corresponds to the linear s=1 haldane chains .",
    "the coupling between these chains was estimated to be @xmath127 , which corresponds to @xmath128 mev .",

    "in fact these two solutions are magnetically equivalent : in the first case @xmath132 prevails and the single spin-1 chain is realized , while in the second case @xmath126 is dominant , that corresponds to the formation of two independent spin-1 chains .",
    "this illustrates the fact that the fitting of the magnetic susceptibility data for materials with competing magnetic interactions is not unique : different sets of parameters can lead to similar behavior of the susceptibility .",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum in single crystals might settle this issue .",
    "the comprehensive analysis of complex spin wave spectrum obtained by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) technique @xcite in low temperature monoclinic phase of cav@xmath0o@xmath1 have been carried out within linear spin - wave theory and leads to the determination of ten exchange parameters as well as two single ion anisotropy for nonequivalent v ions .",

    "moreover , the exchange interactions in zigzag rungs are rather strong @xmath142 5.7 - 11 mev , while the values defined by the susceptibility fitting are much smaller @xmath143 mev .",
    "thus , it is clear that there is some controversy in the analysis of exchange interactions derived from the magnetic susceptibility and inelastic neutron scattering measurements .    to summarize this section ,",

    "it is also worth to mention that the experimental and theoretical exchange interactions seem to evidence against the ladder model ( @xmath41 , @xmath150 ) for the monoclinic phase of cav@xmath0o@xmath1 .      in order to compare the obtained values of the exchange interactions with experiment",
    "we first solve the next - nearest - neighbor spin-1 chain heisenberg model separately for v1 and v2 using exact diagonalization ( ed ) method implemented in the alps simulation package @xcite . in these calculations , for the nearest - neighbor interactions in the chain @xmath62 , we use the averaged value of @xmath151 and @xmath152 ; and for the next - nearest - neighbor interactions , we use @xmath153 . by doing so , we actually simulate the behavior of the orthorhombic phase , which is realized above 141 k and for which @xmath154 .",
    "the l=12 spins along the chain were taken into account . from figure  [ chi](a )",
    "one can see that the behavior of the single v1 chain with the leading exchange @xmath144@xmath116 mev agrees with experimental data very well , in agreement with results of  @xcite .",

    "because of the v2 contribution , the obtained susceptibility deviates considerably from the experimental one below 500 k ( see figure  [ chi](b ) ) , indicating that probably the model of two noninteracting alternating chains is not appropriate for cav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "then , we try to take into account the interactions between different chains and solve a more complex model using quantum monte - carlo method implemented in the alps simulation package  @xcite . because of the complexity of the problem ( the existence of two inequivalent chains and different types of interactions between the chains ) we have to rely on additional simplifications .",
    "first , we neglect the contributions of small and alternating ( fm and afm ) interactions @xmath155 . as the result",
    ", the problem is reduced to the analysis of a two - dimensional model .",

    "<S> the obtained behavior of exchange interactions substantially differs from the previously proposed phenomenological picture based on the magnetic measurements and structural considerations , namely : ( i ) despite quasi - one - dimensional character of the crystal structure , consisting of the zigzag chains of edge - sharing vo@xmath2 octahedra , the electronic structure is essentially three - dimensional , that leads to finite interactions between the chains ; ( ii ) the exchange interactions along the legs of the chains appear to dominate ; and ( iii ) there is a substantial difference of exchange interactions in two crystallographically inequivalent chains . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these three factors successfully reproduces the behavior of experimental magnetic susceptibility . </S>"
