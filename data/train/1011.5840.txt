    "in addition , our results show how the two components of this accretion flow vary with the changing accretion rate . in the hard state ,",
    "mostly the overall normalization changes , which is , presumably , due to a changing accretion rate . in intermediate states ,",
    "the variability is driven by variable irradiation of the inner hot flow ( with an approximately constant power ) by soft photons from the outer disc , which inner radius varies .",
    "the disc moves towards the last stable orbit in the soft states and the hot flow becomes a hot corona above the disc .",
    "the variability is then driven by changing dissipation in the corona , whereas the disc remains stable . in the last two variability patterns , the variability is due to changing of the weaker spectral component , blackbody emission from the outer disc in the hard state , and hard x - rays from the hot plasma above the inner disc in the soft state .",
