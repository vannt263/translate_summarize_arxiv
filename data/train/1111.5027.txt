    "one of the most interesting unresolved questions in the study of galaxy morphology is the origin of s0 galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are common in the denser parts of clusters @xcite , which suggests a cluster - based formation mechanism .",
    "the discovery that clusters evolve from spiral - dominated at @xmath3 to s0-dominated at lower redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is evidence that clusters may in fact be turning spiral galaxies into s0s .",
    "indeed , transformation mechanisms such as ram - pressure stripping @xcite require high orbital velocities and a relatively dense , hot igm , as found in clusters .",
    "however , s0 galaxies are also found in _",
    "low_-density environments such as small groups and even the local field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which suggests one of two things : either cluster - specific mechanisms such as ram - pressure stripping can not create s0s , or there are actually multiple channels for forming s0s , some operating in clusters and others in lower - density regions .",
    "@xcite found evidence suggesting that both ram - pressure stripping and strangulation / starvation @xcite may be operating in massive clusters , while @xcite argue that a significant fraction of local field and group s0s probably became s0s as central galaxies within their dark - matter halos , which implies mechanisms other than interactions with the igm ( e.g. , minor mergers ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the multiple - channel scenario is true , then there may be differences in s0 galaxies as a function of environment , differences which could be used to test s0 formation models .",
    "one galaxy feature which might show environmental influences quite clearly is the structure of the outer disk , which should be more vulnerable to effects such as gas stripping , tidal perturbations , and late - time accretion .",
    "recent work @xcite has shown that the surface - brightness profiles of outer disks  traditionally supposed to be purely exponential , or else exponential with sharp outer truncations ",
    "fall into three broad classes : single - exponential ( freeman [ 1970 ] type  i ) , truncated ( freeman type  ii ) , or antitruncated ( type  iii ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; see figure  [ fig : profiles ] for examples .",
    "all three profiles have been observed in spiral galaxies out to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xcite indicated that local s0 disks are evenly divided between the three main classes .",
    "that study , however , was based on a sample of galaxies including both the virgo cluster and the local field . clearly , it would be of interest to see whether there are differences in the outer disks of s0 galaxies as a function of environment .",
    "this letter explores that possibility by comparing the outer disk profiles of s0s in the virgo cluster with those of local field s0s .",
    "the virgo sample was constructed using the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , starting with all galaxies having @xmath5 _ and _ secure membership .",
    "data from rc3 @xcite were then obtained for each of these galaxies , in order to isolate galaxies which were s0 _ and _ had axis ratios @xmath6 .",
    "( ngc 4733 is classified as `` e+ '' in rc3 but has an sb0 classification in ned and clearly hosts a strong bar , so we included it in the sample . ) we then checked each galaxy for distance measurements .",
    "this showed that ngc 4600 had a surface - brightness fluctuation distance of @xmath7 mpc @xcite , indicating that is a foreground object ; we transferred it to the field sample .",
    "several other galaxies were rejected because they overlapped with bright neighbors or very bright stars , had significantly distorted outer isophotes , were clearly edge - on , or were not actual s0 galaxies .",
    "finally , we restricted ourselves to galaxies with @xmath8 ; this limit approximates the traditional boundaries between dwarf and giant galaxies , and corresponds to stellar masses @xmath9 ( assuming a typical s0 @xmath10 of @xmath11 and the color - based mass - to - light ratios of zibetti et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the result was a set of 24 virgo cluster s0 galaxies .",
    "the field sample was designed to have the same absolute magnitude limit and a distance limit of @xmath12 mpc .",
    "the starting point was a combined set of barred and unbarred galaxies , whose surface - brightness profiles were presented in @xcite and @xcite , respectively ( many of the virgo s0 galaxies were also included in those studies ) . however , those samples were diameter - limited ( @xmath13 ) and therefore tended to exclude more compact galaxies and galaxies at larger distances . to better match the virgo sample , we defined the field sample as follows : all galaxies from hyperleda with hubble types @xmath14 , @xmath0 , declination @xmath15 , and redshifts ( corrected for virgocentric infall ) @xmath16 . galaxies which were vcc members were excluded ( the only exception being ngc  4600 ; see above ) . as in the virgo cluster sample ,",
    "rc3 measurements were then used to identify s0 galaxies with axis ratios @xmath6 .",
    "after closer inspection , nine galaxies were rejected for having been misclassified ( e.g. , ngc 2853 is classified as sb@xmath17 , but is clearly an early - type spiral ) , interacting or overlapping with neighboring galaxies or bright stars , or being too highly inclined despite the published axis ratio .",
    "the resulting ( nominal ) field sample has a total of 55 s0 galaxies ; however , suitable images are not available for all .",
    "since images from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have proven more than adequate for outer - disk profile work ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we decided to use data release 7 ( dr7 * ? ? ? * ) as our primary image source .",
    "this encompasses the entire virgo cluster and much of the nearby northern field ; 43 of the field s0 galaxies have dr7 images .",
    "an additional seven s0 galaxies outside dr7 have already been analyzed using other image sources by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we include these in our final sample in order to increase the field - galaxy numbers .",
    "doing so does , however , introduce a slight bias in favor of brighter galaxies in the field sample , since the galaxies in the erwin et al./gutierrez et al .",
    "samples were selected to have @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , we check all our results by using both the full field sample ( 50 s0 galaxies ) and a `` dr7-only '' subsample , restricted to the 43 field s0 galaxies covered by dr7 .",
    "we use the term `` field '' somewhat loosely , since we did not attempt to distinguish between groups and genuinely isolated galaxies .",
    "however , we _ do _ believe that there is a clear difference between the virgo cluster and field samples : the latter does not include any truly high - mass groups comparable to virgo . in the nearby optical galaxy groups ( nogg ) catalogs @xcite , the largest group within 2500 in redshift and with @xmath18 _ other _ than the virgo cluster is the ursa major `` cluster '' @xcite , which has three of our field s0s .",
    "this spiral - dominated group has a velocity dispersion of only 148 , compared with 715 for the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "twelve field s0s have no group assignment in the nogg catalogs at all and are therefore plausible isolated galaxies .",
    "the field sample is thus a mixture of low - mass groups and isolated galaxies , providing a strong contrast with the virgo cluster sample .",
    "the two samples do not show any significant differences in absolute magnitude ( kolmogorov - smirnov @xmath19 ) .",
    "details of the process for extracting azimuthally averaged surface - brightness profiles of outer disks are presented in @xcite . here , we briefly summarize the basic approach and discuss new automated techniques used to analyze sdss images of the 28 galaxies not previously classified by erwin et al .  or @xcite .",
    "images for each galaxy were retrieved from the sdss archive ; if the galaxy was near the top or bottom of the image , the adjacent field was retrieved and the fields merged to form a larger image ( adjacent fields in the vertical direction are from a single drift - scan observing run ) .",
    "careful sky subtraction is essential , as is careful masking of bright stars and other galaxies near the target galaxy .",
    "we started by running sextractor @xcite on the @xmath20-band images .",
    "the resulting catalog was processed into an saoimage ds9 region file ( converting stars to circles and galaxies to ellipses , with sizes being multiples of the sextractor isophotal area ) .",
    "these regions were then displayed on the image and edited ( adding additional masking if necessary and removing regions corresponding to the target galaxy ) .",
    "a mask image was then generated from the region file , for use in conjunction with the ellipse - fitting ( below ) .",
    "the mask file was _ also _ used for sky subtraction : median pixel values were determined for 100150 @xmath21-pixel regions , with locations chosen randomly such that they fell outside masked regions _ and _ were not within @xmath22 of the galaxy center ( @xmath23 = half of the @xmath24 diameter ) .",
    "the final sky value was the mean of these median measurements , with uncertainty @xmath25 computed by bootstrap resampling .",
    "we used @xmath25 to compute a limiting surface brightness @xmath26 ; this is the level at which a 1-@xmath25 error in the sky subtraction would produce a 0.2 mag arcsec@xmath27 shift in the surface - brightness profile ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "median - smoothed images were inspected to identify any residual large - scale gradients ( typically vertical , due to changes in sky brightness during the sdss drift scan ) ; if present , these were removed with the iraf imsurfit task .",
    "after sky subtraction , the galaxy disk orientation was determined by fitting ellipses to the @xmath20-band isophotes , using the iraf task ellipse .",
    "ellipses corresponding to the outer disk ( i.e. , outside any bars and prominent rings ) were used to determine the overall galaxy orientation , under the assumption that the outer disk is approximately circular .",
    "we then re - ran ellipse with ellipse shape and orientation fixed to that of the outer disk .",
    "this generates surface - brightness profiles corresponding to circular averaging if the galaxy were face - on .",
    "( this approximation fails at small radii if there is a prominent , rounder bulge , but this does not affect the outer profile . ) a key advantage of this approach is that it allows measuring the profile to much fainter levels than is possible when the program must simultaneously fit variable ellipses to the isophotes ; typically , we can trace the profile to at least twice @xmath23 .",
    "finally , the surface - brightness profiles were classified into the three basic types ( figure  [ fig : profiles ] ) , with additional subtyping as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "classifications and parameters for galaxies not in @xcite or @xcite are presented in table  [ tab : results ] .    since the influence of environmental effects",
    "are expected to be stronger in the outer disk , it makes sense to concentrate on differences in profiles at larger radii . @xcite and @xcite noted that a small fraction of type  ii profiles had breaks at or interior to the bar radius ( `` type  ii.i '' profiles ) .",
    "it seems likely that these profiles are not produced by the same mechanisms that produce truncations at much larger radii ; in fact , they appear to be produced spontaneously in isolated disks due to bar formation @xcite .",
    "thus , in our statistical analyses we do not consider ii.i profiles to be true `` truncations '' , and group them with the type  i or iii profiles ( depending on the profile shape outside the bar ) . because the distinction between ii.i and ii.o profiles is only possible for barred galaxies ,",
    "we also look at the distribution of profile types for barred galaxies separately . for the s0 galaxies",
    "not previously studied in @xcite or @xcite , we carefully analyzed red ( and , if available , near - ir ) images for the presence of bars , and measured any such bars that were found ; these measurements will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the absolute numbers of type  ii.i profiles are quite small : two in the virgo cluster s0s and none in the field .",
    "the distribution of profile types is summarized in figure  [ fig : hist ] , both for the complete sample ( left panel ) and for just the barred galaxies ( right panel ) .",
    "two features are immediately apparent .",
    "first , there is a _",
    "complete absence of truncations in virgo cluster s0s _ , in contrast to the relatively high frequency of truncations in field s0s : @xmath28% of all field s0s",
    "( @xmath29% of barred field s0s ) . for the dr7-only subsample ( see section  [ sec : samples ] ) , the frequencies in the field are @xmath30% for all field s0s and @xmath31% for the barred s0s .",
    "second , type  i profiles are significantly more common in the virgo cluster ( @xmath32% ) than in the field ( @xmath33% , or @xmath34% for just the barred galaxies ; @xmath35% and @xmath36% , respectively , for the dr7-only subsample ) .",
    "type  iii profiles , on the other hand , are equally common in both environments .",
    "the difference in profile frequencies seems strong ; is it statistically significant ? rather than focus on , e.g. , just the difference in truncation frequency ( which amounts to selecting out the strongest deviation after the fact ) , we ask whether the distribution of all three profile types is similar for virgo and field galaxies . for this",
    ", we can use the extended version of fisher s exact test .",
    "for the complete virgo and field samples , the @xmath37 fisher s exact test gives @xmath38 for the null hypothesis that both field and virgo distributions come from the same parent population , and @xmath39 when only the barred galaxies are considered .",
    "restricted to the dr7-only subsample , the signficance becomes even stronger : @xmath40 for all s0s and @xmath41 for barred s0s .",
    "( when the smaller number of _ unbarred _ galaxies are considered , the differences are _ not _ significant . )",
    "so the difference in outer - disk profiles between the virgo cluster and the local field is both large _ and _ statistically significant .",
    "could we be missing truncations at larger radii in the virgo s0s , and thus mis - classifying them as type  i ?",
    "this seems quite unlikely .",
    "figure  [ fig : break - radii ] shows that break radii for field s0s occur at @xmath4212 kpc , with surface brightnesses at the break of @xmath43 mag arcsec@xmath27 ; the mean @xmath44 is 22.7 .",
    "also plotted are limits on any possible breaks for type  i profiles .",
    "the latter are all @xmath45 mag arcsec@xmath27 , much fainter than any observed breaks .",
    "-band surface brightness at the break ( @xmath46 ) versus break radius @xmath47 for truncations ( black circles ) . also shown",
    "are upper limits on @xmath46 and lower limits on @xmath47 for undetected truncations in type  i profiles ( black = field , gray = virgo cluster ) .",
    "the clear gap in @xmath46 between the detected truncations and the upper limits indicates that we are probably _ not _ missing truncations in virgo cluster galaxies due to surface - brightness limits.,width=355 ]",
    "we can summarize the difference between outer - disk profiles in the virgo cluster and the field thus : type  iii profiles are ( roughly ) equally common in virgo and in the field ; in virgo , the remaining profiles are _ all _ type  i , while in the field they are half type  i and half type  ii .",
    "( we note that maltby et al .",
    "2011 found no significant environmental differences for _ spiral _ disk - profile frequencies in and around a multiple - cluster system at @xmath48 ; however , their classification scheme used a narrow surface - brightness range and is thus rather different from ours . ''",
    "example profiles show clear type  ii breaks . ] ) if we focus on the difference between type  i and ii profiles and assume that it is indeed directly due to environmental effects , we can posit two possibilities : either something in the cluster ( or proto - cluster ) environment transforms type ii profiles into type  i , or else something _ prevents _ a type  i to type  ii transition which is common in the field .",
    "the most popular models for disk truncations combine two elements .",
    "the first is a radial dropoff in efficient star formation , either because the gas density falls below some critical star - formation threshold @xcite or because the gas density profile itself has a sharp break , possibly due to accretion - induced warping @xcite .",
    "the second element is the outward scattering of stars from the inner disk , such as produced by transient spiral arms @xcite .",
    "the main problem is that these models tend to approach disk truncation as a universal phenomenon and do not , in general , explain how and why truncations might _ not _ occur .",
    "if we assume that a significant fraction of present - day cluster s0s originally had truncations , then we can look for something which could erase truncations .",
    "one possibility is `` harassment '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where a galaxy s motion through the ( evolving ) cluster potential leads to repeated tidal shocks . the `` high - surface - brightness '' model galaxy in ( * ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "7 ) had its initially single - exponential profile transformed into a mild antitruncation by this process ; this suggests that a type  ii profile could `` flatten out '' into a type  i profile ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "more detailed simulations involving disks with initially truncated profiles are needed to see if this is a viable mechanism .",
    "( of course , this can not be the _ only _ way to form type  i profiles , since they are also found in the field . )",
    "alternatively , we can consider cluster - based mechanisms which might prevent type  ii profiles from forming in the first place .",
    "if , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite , truncations in s0s and early - type spirals are predominantly related to the same sort of bar  outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) interactions which produce outer rings , then one possible scenario might be the following .",
    "the long dynamical times in outer disks suggest  and simulations agree  that large - scale changes there such as outer - ring formation require several gyr ( see references in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since bar - olr interactions are strengthened by the presence of signficant gas in the outer disk ( gas , being dynamically cooler than the stellar disk , more readily absorbs angular momentum from the bar ) , the _ removal _ of gas should weaken olr effects .",
    "one possible signature of this might be a tendency of gas - deficient spirals to be less likely to have type  ii profiles and outer rings .",
    "if s0s in the field were able to retain gas in their outer disk for longer periods , they would be more likely to show the effects of bar - olr interactions and develop type  ii profiles .",
    "s0 galaxies in virgo , on the other hand , could have lost their gas  particularly in the outer disk ",
    "earlier on due to , e.g. , a combination of ram - pressure stripping and strangulation .    we thank dave wilman for helpful comments , michael pohlen for the initial version of the catalog - parsing code , and the referee for suggesting the possible relevance of h  i depletion .",
