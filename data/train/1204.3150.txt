    "a half - metallic antiferromagnet has one conducting spin channel and the other insulating spin channel , but shows zero net moment in a unit cell.@xcite contrary to the conventional antiferromagnet , antialigned moments of two different kinds of magnetic ions are exactly compensated by each other .",
    "thus this is more properly called a compensated half - metal ( chm).@xcite since chm has no net moment , chm is of extreme interest to spintronics and is anticipated to generate a single spin superconductor,@xcite though no true chm has yet been established .    after pickett s prediction,@xcite double perovskite ( dp ) compounds have been investigated as the most promising candidates for chm .",

    "the reasons for this are not yet clear , but some seem to result from antisite disorder on b and b@xmath8 sites.@xcite in particular , in systems having @xmath10 ions in both b and b@xmath8 sites , similar ionic radii often prevent a well - ordered sample from being established , resulting in undermined compensation of magnetic moments .",

    "the moment is consistent with pickett s theoretical prediction in the well - ordered phase,@xcite though the sample shows a small amount of antisite disorder .",
    "this implies that the effects of such a small amount of disorder on the net moment are negligible in la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 .    from the theoretical point of view",

    "however , the experimental observations show that this system is an insulating fi.@xcite    in this paper , to disentangle this controversy , first we will revisit la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1   using lsda , lda+u , the modified becke - johnson functional,@xcite and fixed spin moment ( fsm ) approach.@xcite our results confirm the insulating fi la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 , consistent with the experimental observations.@xcite second , we will address the electronic and magnetic properties of the as - yet - unsynthesized dp sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 , mainly using lda+u which shows good agreement with the results of the experiment on la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 .",
    "one of the current authors and pickett suggested a half semimetallic antiferromagnet in the isovalent and isostructural sr@xmath0cr@xmath16o@xmath1 ( @xmath16=os , ru).@xcite in the previous calculations with lsda,@xcite sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1   was suggested to be a simple metallic ferrimagnet .",
    "however , in our calculations including the coulomb correlations , dp sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1   is a precisely compensated half - metal , as will be confirmed by fsm studies .",
    "in the cubic dp ( space group : @xmath17 , no . 225 ) , the fe and cr ions sit on the @xmath18 ( 0,0,0 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20,@xmath20,@xmath20 ) sites , respectively . for la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1",
    ", we used the lattice parameter @xmath21=7.84   , which was estimated from the experiment.@xcite within lsda , the internal parameter of o ions , lying on the @xmath22 sites ( @xmath23,0,0 ) , is optimized .",
    "our optimized internal parameter @xmath23=0.2508 implies nearly identical oxidization states between the fe and cr ions .    for sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 ,",
    "our preliminary investigations using the spuds program indicate that the cubic dp is a stable structure.@xcite besides , considering tetravalent cr and fe ions ( see below ) , the tolerance factor is @xmath24 unity for the ideal dp , using the shannon ionic radius @xmath25.@xcite thus , we fully optimized the lattice and internal parameters of the cubic dp in this initial study . using lsda",
    ", our optimized lattice constant is @xmath21=7.447  , about 15% smaller volume than la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1   and sr@xmath0croso@xmath1.@xcite the internal parameter @xmath23=0.2513 leads to a cr - o bond length which is only 0.01    shorter than the fe - o bond length . here ,",
    "we neglect such a small distortion as is observed in sr@xmath0croso@xmath1,@xcite since no significant change in the net moment results from this distortion.@xcite    our calculations were carried out with lsda and lda+u approaches implemented in two all - electron full - potential codes fplo and wien2k .",
    "@xcite in these lda+u calculations , two popular double - counting schemes , the so - called around mean field and fully localized limit,@xcite show similar results for these compounds .",
    "the proper values of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath6 in these systems are unclear , but 34 ev for cr ions@xcite and 6 ev for fe ions have been often used.@xcite ( the hund s exchange integral @xmath26=1 ev was fixed for all values of @xmath6 , since results obtained from @xmath27=@xmath28 were identical with ones from separate @xmath6 and @xmath26 inputs . ) fsm calculations implemented in fplo were also carried out to investigate the robustness of our results .",
    "in addition , the becke - johnson functional modified by tran and blaha ( the so - called mbj),@xcite implemented in wien2k , was used for comparison with our lda+u results for la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 .",
    "the semilocal functional mbj is much cheaper than a hybrid functional , but provides reasonable agreement with experiments for transition metal oxides.@xcite    the brillouin zone was sampled with a regular mesh containing up to 256 irreducible k - points .",
    "the structural parameters were optimized until forces were smaller than 1 mev /    using fplo . in wien2k ,",
    "the basis size was determined by @xmath29=7 and the apw sphere radii : 2.5 for la , 1.95 for cr , 1.96 for fe , and 1.72 for o in la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 ; 2.47 for sr , 1.84 for cr , 1.89 for fe , and 1.64 for o in sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 .",
    "to unravel the discrepancies stated in the introduction , we revisit la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1   using various approaches : lsda , lda+u , mbj , and fsm . all of these calculations give consistent results ( see below ) .",
    "first , we will the address the fsm results within lsda .",
    "the energy vs. total moment @xmath30 plot is given in fig .",
    "[ lafsm ] .",
    "we obtained two solutions : fi below @xmath30@xmath313.5 @xmath15 and fm above @xmath30@xmath314.5 @xmath15 , while both states coexist in the region of @xmath323.54.5 @xmath15 .",
    "as @xmath30 is increased from the precisely compensated state ( @xmath30=0 ) , the energy decreases monotonically and reaches a minimum at @xmath30=2 @xmath15 . below the minimum ,",
    "the local moment of cr , @xmath33@xmath312.4 @xmath15 , is nearly unchanged , while that of fe increases monotonically . above the minimum ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath33 decreases and finally becomes almost zero at @xmath30=4 .",
    "the minimum state is insulating , leading to nonanalytic behavior in the fsm curve near the minimum as observed in half - metals.@xcite in the fm regime , the minimum energy occurs at @xmath30@xmath14 7 . as @xmath30 is reduced from the minimum , the ratio @xmath34 of the local moments linearly decreases .",
    "this fm minimum state has higher energy by 175 mev than the fi minimum state .",
    "thus , our fsm calculations indicate that the ground state is the insulating fi state of @xmath30=2 @xmath15 , in agreement with our self - consistent calculations ( see below ) .    in lsda calculations",
    ", we obtained both fm and fi states .",
    "as mentioned previously , fi is energitically favored over fm .",
    "this fm state has the total moment of @xmath30=7.23 @xmath15 ( 3.90 for fe , 2.74 for cr , and 0.51 for the six oxygens ) . in the fi state ,",
    "the total moment of @xmath30=2 is decomposed into local moments of 3.94 for fe , 2.37 for cr , and 0.24 for the six oxygens ( in units of @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus this system has nominally high spin fe@xmath4 ( @xmath35@xmath36 ) and cr@xmath4 ( @xmath37 ) , as is also visible in doss given in fig .",
    "[ lados ] .",
    "note that the strong @xmath38 hybridization , observable around 6 ev , substantially reduces the fe moment .",
    "the @xmath39-@xmath40 crystal field splitting of fe is 2 ev , about 1 ev smaller than the exchange splitting , leading to high spin @xmath2=@xmath5 fe@xmath4 .",
    "both the @xmath39-@xmath40 crystal field and exchange splittings of cr are about 2 ev . compared with the metallic fm state ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic interactions between fe and cr ions lead to gaps in both spin channels , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lados ] .",
    "so this system becomes a band insulator , consistent with the experiment.@xcite note that the nonmagnetic state has a much higher energy than these two states .",
    "miura and terakura claimed that the ground state was an insulating fm through lda+u calculations using a pseudopotential code,@xcite in contrast to the experimental observations .",
    "we investigated this system using the lda+u approach , implemented in two all - electron full - potential codes fplo and wien2k.@xcite we considered the coulomb correlation of both transition metals in the range of @xmath6=37 ev . as shown in the calculations of miura and terakura , two insulating fm and fi states were obtained .",
    "however , in our calculations , the fi with @xmath30=2 @xmath15 is energetically favored over the fm state with @xmath30=8 @xmath15 , regardless of the strength of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath6 . in particular , at @xmath6=4 ev for cr and 6 ev for fe , the difference in energy between the states is 86 mev .    to confirm our results , we carried out mbj calculations , which give the correct magnetic ground state in a parent compound of cuprate cacuo@xmath0.@xcite consistently with our other calculations described above",
    ", the fi state has a lower energy by 180 mev than the fm state , indicating that our results are very robust and show good agreement with the experiment.@xcite the mbj total and atom - projected doss are given in fig .",
    "[ mbjdos ] . compared with lsda results shown in fig .",
    "[ lados ] , the unoccupied @xmath39 manifolds of cr in the spin up and fe in the spin down considerably shift up , while the occupied bands show very similar features .",
    "the local moments are 4.11 for fe , 2.42 for cr , and 0.60 for the six oxygens , again resulting in the net moment of 2 ( in units of @xmath15 ) .",
    "the gaps are 2.5 ev and 1.8 ev for the spin up and down channels , respectively .",
    "the lsda total and atom - projected doss are represented in fig .",
    "[ ldados ] . in the spin down channel ,",
    "the partially filled @xmath39 manifolds of both cr and fe lie in the region of 1 to 1 ev , and come into contact with the unfilled fe @xmath41 manifold .",
    "this mixing between cr and fe @xmath39 manifolds remains significant even for inclusion of correlation effects ( see below ) , indicating an unusual charge transfer . in the up channel , the completely filled fe @xmath39",
    "manifold lies in the range of 1.7 to 1 ev , while the center of the unfilled cr @xmath39 manifold with the width of 0.5 ev is at 1 ev .",
    "for fe ions , the @xmath39-@xmath40 crystal field splitting of 1.8 ev in the spin up is accidentally equal to the exchange splitting of the @xmath39 manifold .",
    "so , some of the fe @xmath41 bands cross over @xmath42 , undermining the half - metallicity . in this state ,",
    "the cr moment of 1.32 @xmath15 is antialigned with those of fe and the oxygens ( 1.86 for fe and 0.21 for 6o ) , resulting in the total moment 0.75 @xmath15 .",
    "these results indicate formally tetravalent @xmath43 cr and @xmath44 fe ions of @xmath2=1 both in this system , in contrast to trivalent cr and pentavalent @xmath12 os / ru in sr@xmath0cr@xmath16o@xmath1 . within lsda these distinctions between the systems",
    "lead to metallic sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 , but half - semimetallic ( _ i.e. _ , band insulating ) sr@xmath0cr@xmath16o@xmath1 .",
    "thus , this requires the inclusion of correlations to sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 , as is usual in 3d systems . in the next subsection",
    ", we will address this issue .",
    "this fi state is energetically favored over the nonmagnetic state by 283 mev , consistent with our fsm calculations ( see below ) .",
    "attempts to obtain a fm state always converged to the fi or nonmagnetic state .",
    "thus , the state of the antialigned moments is very stable .      in lda+u calculations , as in la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 , we used values of @xmath6 in the range of 37 ev for both cr and fe ions , showing consistent results",
    "now , we will focus on results obtained at @xmath6= 4 ev for cr and 6 ev for fe , which have been widely used in perovskite - type oxides.@xcite    figure [ uband ] shows an enlarged band structure near @xmath42 , indicating a half - metal .",
    "the mixture of cr @xmath39 and @xmath41 manifolds in the spin up and the fe @xmath40 manifold in the spin down lies in the range from 1 to 3.5 ev . in particular ,",
    "the cr @xmath39 around 2 ev is nearly dispersionless . in the spin up ( insulating ) channel",
    ", the top of the valence bands has mostly o @xmath45 character , leading to a gap of 1.8 ev between the o @xmath45 and the cr @xmath40 bands , as clearly shown in the total and atom - projected doss of the top panel of fig .",
    "the fe @xmath39 manifold in the spin up is completely filled . in the spin down ( conducting ) channel ,",
    "the overlapped @xmath39 manifolds of fe and cr are partially filled . in this regime , each character of cr and fe is nearly identical to that of the oxygens , indicating strong @xmath38 hybridization .",
    "this substantial hybridization is also visible in doss of the top panel of fig .",
    "[ udos ] . applying @xmath6 to both fe and cr ions leads to a charge transfer of 0.5@xmath46 ( which is measured from the mullikan charge decomposition in the fplo method ) from the six oxygens to the fe ion , subsequently enhancing the @xmath45-@xmath47 hybridization . as a result",
    ", the moment of fe remarkably reduces to 0.98 @xmath15 , but that of the six oxygens increases to 0.42 @xmath15 .",
    "however , the cr moment remains nearly unchanged , resulting in zero net moment .",
    "we also carried out mbj calculations in this system .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ udos ] shows the corresponding doss , reproducing the half - metallicity .",
    "compared with lda+u results , the unfilled fe @xmath41 manifolds shift toward @xmath42 in both spin channels , leading to decreasing the @xmath39-@xmath41 crystal field splitting of fe ions . in the spin down ,",
    "the partially filled fe @xmath39 manifold moves upward , while the cr @xmath39 manifold shifts down .",
    "so , the unusual mixing between these @xmath39 manifolds , which is observed in lsda and lda+u , is considerably diminished , though some amount of the mixing is still visible .",
    "however , the net moment remains zero : 1.80 for fe , 1.96 for cr , and 0.36 for 6o ( in units of @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus , this system is a precisely compensated half - metal .      to investigate the robustness of this compensated half - metal , we carried out fsm calculations.@xcite the change in energy vs. total moment @xmath30 plot",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fsm ] . in lsda , we obtained two curves . in the range of @xmath30=0 to 2.5 @xmath15 fi solutions are obtained , while fm solutions are obtained above 2.7 @xmath15 .",
    "the fi state with @xmath30=0.75 @xmath15 is the ground state , about 50 mev lower in energy than chm . at @xmath30=0 , the nonmagnetic state",
    "has 230 mev higher energy than chm .",
    "so , a state having antialigned moments of cr and fe ions is energetically favored .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fsm ] shows fsm results for fm states in lda+u .",
    "note that the chm state with @xmath30=0 , which is set to the zero energy , has lowest energy .",
    "contrary to the lsda results , fi states could be obtained only near @xmath30@xmath310 ( not shown here ) .",
    "interestingly , a plateau appears in the range of @xmath30=1 to 2 @xmath15 .",
    "our self - consistent calculations also produce a fm state having @xmath30@xmath312 in lda+u .",
    "this implies that a meta - stable state may appear in the regime of a plateau .",
    "figure [ schemdos ] displays the schematic atom - projected doss of both transition metals in la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 , sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 , and sr@xmath0crruo@xmath1 , indicating two interesting aspects .",
    "first , fe ions are in the @xmath13 @xmath2@xmath48 high spin state in la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 , but in the @xmath44 @xmath2=1 low spin state in sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 .",
    "to uncover the origin of the transition of the fe spin states when replacing la with sr , we carried out calculations of sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1   with the same structure as la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 .",
    "our results show that sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1   has a similar electronic structure to la@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 , with the only difference being the band filling , resulting in a simple ferrimagnetic metal with a @xmath44 @xmath2=2 high spin fe ion .",
    "this indicates that the 15% volume in sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1   reduction leads to an increase in the crystal field splitting , and subsequently the transition .",
    "second , sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1   is half - metallic , while an isovalent and isostructural sr@xmath0crruo@xmath1 is semimetallic .",
    "chm sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1   remains unchanged even for our calculations with the same structure as sr@xmath0crruo@xmath1 .",
    "thus , this distinction results from chemical differences between fe and ru ions rather than differences in the crystal structure .    in summary",
