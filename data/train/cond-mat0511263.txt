    "a key quantity in monte carlo simulation of equilibrium systems is the heathbath temperature @xmath0 .",

    "temperature is usually a parameter with an imposed value , the fluctuating quantity being the energy , and this corresponds to simulate a canonical ensemble .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite that also a microcanonical formulation can be constructed , in which the system energy is constrained whereas the temperature is computed as a dependent quantity . in this formulation",
    "the temperature is found to assume the correct value at equilibrium , thus establishing the equivalence of simulating the microcanonical and the canonical ensemble .",
    "our work aims to investigate the possibility of associating an istantaneous temperature to a system even when this is out of the quilibrium .",
    "therefore we have employed the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite in a non equilibrium case , by computing the temperature of the ising model along a quench from high temperature .",
    "we have then extended the method to the potts model with @xmath4 states . with",
    "similar aims different approaches for off - lattice systems ( molecular dynamics ) have been recently introduced @xcite that however are not suitable for lattice models .    in the method adopted here computation bases on the statistical distribution of the site - site interaction energies .",
    "the most interesting finding is that the shape of the distribution computed along the quench is very similar to the one which characterizes the system at equilibrium , but corresponds to a different value of the temperature .",
    "thence it is possible to associate an instantaneous temperature to the non equilibrium states of the system .    in section",
    "ii we recall how temperature can be determined in the ising system at equilibrium ; in sec .",
    "iii the method is applied to the same system in non equilibrium and in sec .",
    "iv it is extended to the potts model with @xmath4 states .",
    "main results are summarized in sec .",
    "in ref . @xcite",
    "the equilibrium temperature is computed on the base of the statistical properties of the site - site interaction energies for a generic lattice gas model . in the case of the ising model , with hamiltonian @xmath5 where the sum @xmath6 is over nearest neighbors sites and @xmath7",
    ", the temperature is obtained from the distribution of the quantity : @xmath8 }     \\sigma_0 \\sigma_v , \\ ] ] that represents the interaction energy of a generic site @xmath9 with its neighbors @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , can be separated into @xmath11 , where @xmath12 with the the sum extended to all pairs not including the site @xmath13 .",
    "say @xmath14 the ( boltzmann ) probability for the system of @xmath15 sites to stay in the configuration @xmath16 , this is given by @xmath17 where @xmath3 is the inverse temperature ( in boltzmann s constant units ) and @xmath18 the partition function .",
    "the probability @xmath19 of a configuration with @xmath20 , @xmath21 can be obtained as @xmath22   \\exp[-\\beta { \\cal h}_r ] = \\\\ \\exp[-\\beta\\epsilon ] \\sum_{\\sigma_0}\\sum_{\\{\\boldmath{\\sigma_r}\\ } }   \\delta(\\epsilon,\\gamma)\\exp[-\\beta { \\cal h}_r],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 if @xmath24 and @xmath25 otherwise , and @xmath26 is the set of all possible configurations of the system with @xmath27 fixed .",
    "all and only those configurations yielding @xmath20 contribute to the sums in the last term , so they add to a number which only may depend on the temperature and @xmath28 , thus : @xmath29 in order to avoid the explicit computation of @xmath30 , which is as difficult as that of the partition function , let us consider : @xmath31   \\exp[-\\beta { \\cal h}_r ] = \\\\ \\exp[\\beta\\epsilon ] \\sum_{\\sigma_0}\\sum_{\\{\\boldmath{\\sigma_r}\\ } } \\delta(-\\epsilon,\\gamma)\\exp[-\\beta { \\cal h}_r].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by letting @xmath32 , thus @xmath33 , and the last expression yields @xmath34 \\sum_{\\sigma_0'}\\sum_{\\{\\boldmath{\\sigma_r}\\ } } \\delta(-\\epsilon,-\\gamma)\\exp[-\\beta { \\cal h}_r],\\ ] ] that is , since @xmath35 , @xmath36 thence the ratio @xmath37 does not depend on @xmath38 .",
    "this equation derives from the canonical distribution and can be used to estimate the lattice temperature @xmath39 in numerical simulations of the ising model since , by the law of the large numbers , one can approximate @xmath40 being @xmath41 the number of lattice sites with @xmath20 , and thence @xmath42 with @xmath43 if necessary , better estimates can be obtained by computing averages of @xmath44 over time , since the system is at equilibrium . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been checked that eq .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) is well satisfied when simulating the canonical ensemble , and has been used to compute temperature in a microcanonical monte carlo simulation with the kawasaki @xcite dynamics .",
    "monte carlo simulations are extensively employed even for studying non equilibrium properties of systems @xcite . among the others , the properties of systems prepared",
    "far from equilibrium and then allowed to relax towards their equilibrium state .",
    "if for instance the system is initially at high temperature and is put then in contact with a finite temperature heat bath , it starts to cool down and eventually approaches the heath bath temperature . despite the intrinsic artificial nature of monte carlo dynamics ,",
    "physical relevance is generally attributed to results obtained via single site dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is therefore tempting to use eq .",
    "( 2 ) for probing the system temperature during the cooling .",
    "one wishes , in particular , to answer the following two questions :    * is the system at equilibrium on very short time scales ? i.e. does eq .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) , which was derived by assuming the boltzmann ( equilibrium ) statistics , hold during the system cooling ? *",
    "if yes , how does temperature decrease in time during the cooling ?    in order to answers the above questions we have performed monte carlo simulations in which the @xmath45 ising model was quenched from infinite to finite temperature .",
    "we have found that the answer to question @xmath46 is affirmative .    in fig .  1 , @xmath47 is shown for a quench from @xmath48 to @xmath49 at some different times . in this case",
    "the quench temperature is above @xmath50 , and a few monte carlo steps are sufficient for driving the system to thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , before this happens the system already displays a linear relation between @xmath28 and @xmath51 , from which an istantaneous temperature can be derived . as seen also in the inset where @xmath52 is shown . a linear regression of @xmath51 vs @xmath28 at equilibrium yields @xmath53 , with correlation coefficient @xmath54 .",
    "a subcritical quench is shown in fig  2 . here",
    "@xmath55 . in this case",
    "the system takes a long time to reach thermal equilibrium , but eq .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) is quite well satisfied .",
    "it can be seen from the inset that deviations from the linear dependence exist .",
    "they are however small for any @xmath28 , and their average is zero .",
    "quasi - equilibrium is satisfied at any instant and in this case a linear regression on the last curve gives @xmath56 with a correlation coefficient @xmath57 .",
    "the existence of such an equilibrium - like distribution for the system allows for extracting a boltzmann temperature @xmath39 during the system coooling .",
    "figure  3 shows the behavior of the energy as function of this temperature for a quench at @xmath55 , i.e. below the critical temperature @xmath58 .",
    "it is seen that a first regime exists in which the two quantities are proportional .",
    "then , a second regime is entered where a remarkable property can be noticed : the boltzmann temperature attained that of the heatbath but , on the contrary , the energy is still relaxing .",
    "in fact this kind of systems is characterized by a coarsenig process and takes an infinite time to go to equilibrium , the energy decaying as @xmath59 , but it is seen that temperature is already at equilibrium during the coarsening . this behaviour is better pointed out in the inset , where it is seen that energy decreases algebraically while @xmath39 is constant .",
    "when the system is quenched at a temperature above @xmath50 , energy relaxes exponentially to equilibrium and the second regime does not appear .",
    "this is shown in fig .  4 and in the related inset .",
    "for comparison , the equilibrium curve is also reported in the figures , showing that it still lies below the non - equilibrium one .",
    "in order to test the above conclusions on a wider class of systems , we have derived eq .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) for the case of the @xmath4 states potts model , with hamiltonian : @xmath60 where again the sum is over the nearest neighbors , @xmath61 is the kronecker s function , and @xmath62 is the state of site @xmath63",
    ". each site can assume one out of @xmath4 different states , so that one can identify the state with an integer : @xmath64 and the system energy eq .",
    "( [ potts ] ) can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the interaction energy of the site in @xmath13 with its neighbors , and @xmath67 is the energy interaction of the rest of the system .",
    "let us now define @xmath68 the energy eq .",
    "( [ inten ] ) when @xmath69 and similarly @xmath70 the same quantity when @xmath71 . in analogy with the case of the ising model : @xmath72=\\exp[-\\beta \\gamma_{\\rho \\omega}].\\ ] ] thus the probability for @xmath73 to assume the value @xmath28 is given by @xmath74   p(\\omega,\\eta_1,\\dots,\\eta_n ) = \\\\ \\exp[-\\beta\\epsilon ] \\sum_{\\eta_1,\\dots,\\eta_n } \\delta(\\epsilon,\\gamma_{\\rho\\omega } ) p(\\omega,\\eta_1,\\dots,\\eta_n).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by multiplying the left hand side by @xmath75 and he right hand side by @xmath76 one gets @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the system configuration , and thus finally @xmath79 = \\frac{\\langle \\delta(\\eta_0,\\rho ) \\delta(\\epsilon,\\gamma_{\\rho\\omega } )   \\rangle } { \\langle \\delta(\\eta_0,\\omega ) \\delta(\\epsilon,\\gamma_{\\rho\\omega } ) \\rangle}.\\ ] ] thence even for the potts model the temperature can be derived from the site - site energy statistics . the same argument as above holds for any pair of different states @xmath80 , so that one can also write @xmath81 = \\frac{1}{q(q-1 ) } \\sum_{\\eta_0^{(\\alpha)},\\eta_0^{(\\beta ) } } \\frac{\\langle \\delta(\\eta_0,\\eta_0^{(\\alpha ) } )   \\delta(\\epsilon,\\gamma_{\\eta_0^{(\\alpha ) } \\eta_0^{(\\beta ) } } )   \\rangle } { \\langle   \\delta(\\eta_0,\\eta_0^{(\\beta ) } ) \\delta(\\epsilon , \\gamma_{\\eta_0^{(\\alpha ) } \\eta_0^{(\\beta ) } } ) \\rangle}.\\ ] ] this can be helpful for improving statistics in out of equilibrium simulations where the thermal average can not be obtained by averaging over time like in equilibrium cases .",
    "one thus replaces thermal averages with system averages in eq .",

    "it is found that the potts model obeys eq .",
    "( refpottstemperature ) aven in the non equilibrium regime , allowing to extract an instantaneous temperature @xmath39 like done for the ising model .",
    "figure 5 shows the boltzmann temperature @xmath39 vs time for a quench of a seven state potts model at @xmath82 , i.e. below the critical temperature @xmath83 .",
    "it is seen that like for the ising model a first regime exixts in which the two quantities are proportional .",
    "then even in this case the second regime is entered in which @xmath39 is that of the heatbath but the energy is still relaxing due to the coarsening process . the supercritical case reported in fig .",
    "6 shows that @xmath84 after a certain time , as for the ising model .",
    "we have performed many quenches at different final temperature @xmath0 for the the potts model with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the ising model by shifting energies by adding @xmath87 and compressing them by a factor @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "a common feature is that as @xmath0 is decreased below a given value , the system seems unable to reach the equilibrium temperature .",
    "figure  7 shows @xmath39 vs time for the ising model with linear lattice size @xmath90 .",
    "the boltzmann temperature attains the value of @xmath0 if this is above @xmath91 but if @xmath0 is equal or below this value it does nt .",

    "it can be observed that @xmath94 for potts whereas @xmath95 for ising . moreover the limit energy is clearly larger for potts tha for ising .",
    "figure  9 displays the behaviour of @xmath39 after a quench at @xmath96 .",
    "an increase of @xmath97 with increasing size for both ising and potts model is seen .",
    "although extrapolation to @xmath98 appears to give a still finite temperature , it must be point out that the evaluation of @xmath39 via eq .",
    "( [ erre ] ) becomes difficult for quenches at very low temperature , since almost all sites are in the same state and statistical sampling for @xmath99 becomes very poor .",
    "reliable estimates of @xmath39 can be obtained only for finite values of the quench temperature above a bound which depends on system size and kind .",
    "in this work a method for associating an instantaneous temperature to non equilibrium lattice models has been presented which is based on the the probability distribution of the site - site interaction energies and which is derived from the equilibrium boltzmann statistics .",
    "it is found that the same form of distribution is obeyd by the system while cooling after a quench , allowing to associate a boltzmann - like temperature to its non equilibrium states .",
    "while cooling , the boltzmann temperature decreases until the value of the heath bath is attained , both for supercritical and undercritical quenches .",
    "the latter case is particularly worth of notice , since there the system undergoes a coarsening process and equilibrium is never attained from the energetical point of view the method proofs valid for generic potts model with @xmath4 states , provided the heath bath temperature is not to low and the statistical sampling is effective for the considered system size .",
