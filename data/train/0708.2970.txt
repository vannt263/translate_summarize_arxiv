    "the nontrivial properties of the vacuum state are among the most important predictions in quantum field theory .",
    "these properties are manifested in the response of the vacuum to external influences such as external fields . a simple model of the influence",
    "is realized by imposing prescribed boundary conditions on the field operator .",
    "the distortion of the spectrum for the zero - point fluctuations of a quantum field by these conditions results in the shifts in the vacuum expectation values of physical observables , such as the vacuum energy density and stresses , and induces vacuum forces acting on constraining boundaries .",
    "this is the well known casimir effect ( see most97,plun86,bord01,milt02 and references therein ) .",
    "the casimir effect is common to all systems characterized by fluctuating quantities and has important implications on all scales , from cosmological to subnuclear .",
    "in addition to its fundamental interest this effect also plays an important role in the fabrication and operation of nano- and micro - scale mechanical systems and has become an increasingly popular topic in quantum field theory .    an interesting topic in the investigations of the casimir effect",
    "has always been the dependence of the physical characteristics of the vacuum on the geometry of constraining boundaries .",
    "analytic results can usually be found only for highly symmetric geometries including planar , spherically and cylindrically symmetric boundaries .",
    "recently exact results for the casimir force in geometries of a sphere and a cylinder above a plate are obtained in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . aside from their own theoretical and experimental interest , the problems with this type of boundaries are useful for testing the validity of various approximations used to deal with more complicated geometries . in the present paper",
    "we consider a less symmetric exactly solvable geometry of boundaries which is a combination of a wedge with coaxial cylindrical shells .",
    "the casimir effect for wedge - shaped regions is well investigated in literature most97,jphy , deutsch , breviki , brevikii , nest02 . for a conformally coupled scalar and electromagnetic fields the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor inside the wedge is azimuthal symmetric .",
    "in particular , the vacuum energy - momentum tensor is finite everywhere apart points on the edge .",
    "this property is a direct consequence of the conformal invariance in the corresponding problems and does not take place for a non - conformally coupled scalar field . for a scalar field with an arbitrary curvature coupling parameter satisfying",
    "dirichlet boundary condition on the wedge sides the vacuum energy - momentum tensor is evaluated in reza02,saha05cyl .",
    "in addition to the azimuthal dependence this tensor , unlike to the case of conformally coupled fields , is also non - diagonal with nonzero azimuthal - radial off - diagonal component .",
    "the investigations of quantum effects for cylindrical boundaries have received a great deal of attention .",
    "in addition to traditional problems of quantum electrodynamics under the presence of material boundaries , the casimir effect for cylindrical geometries is also important in the flux tube models of confinement @xcite and for determining the structure of the vacuum state in interacting field theories @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the vacuum energy for the electromagnetic field with boundary conditions defined on a cylinder turned out to be technically a more involved problem than the analogous one for a sphere .",
    "first the casimir energy of an infinite perfectly conducting cylindrical shell has been calculated in ref . @xcite by introducing ultraviolet cutoff and later the corresponding result was derived by using other methods milt99,gosd98,lamb99 .",

    "the corresponding casimir densities for the electromagnetic field with perfect conductor boundary conditions on bounding surfaces are considered in @xcite . the closely related problem with a cylindrical shell in the geometry of a cosmic string",
    "is discussed in @xcite for scalar and electromagnetic fields . in both scalar and electromagnetic cases the application of a variant of the generalized abel - plana formula @xcite enables to extract from the vacuum expectation values the parts corresponding to the geometry of a wedge without the cylindrical shell and to present the shell induced parts in terms of rapidly converging integrals .",
    "this geometry is also interesting from the point of view of general analysis for surface divergences in the expectation values of local physical observables for boundaries with discontinuities .",
    "the nonsmoothness of the boundary generates additional contributions to the heat kernel coefficients ( see , for instance , the discussion in @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate one - loop vacuum quantum effects for a scalar field in the geometry of a wedge with two coaxial cylindrical shells assuming dirichlet boundary condition on bounding surfaces .",
    "this geometry generalizes various special cases previously considered in literature for wedge - shaped and cylindrical boundaries .",
    "in addition , we also study the role of nonzero mass of the field quanta .",
    "the presence of boundaries eliminates the translational invariance and as a result the properties of the vacuum are nonuniform .",
    "the most important quantities characterizing the local properties of the vacuum are the expectation values of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source of gravity in the einstein equations .",

    "we evaluate the positive frequency wightman function .",
    "this function gives comprehensive insight into vacuum fluctuations and determines the response of a particle detector of the unruh - dewitt type .",
    "having the vacuum energy - momentum tensor we can derive the vacuum forces acting on constraining boundaries evaluating the vacuum stresses at points on the bounding surfaces . as we will see below , in the geometry under consideration these forces are position dependent on the boundary and can not be obtained by the global method using the total casimir energy ( on the advantages of the local method see also @xcite ) . in the limiting case from the results of the present paper the local vacuum densities",
    "are obtained for the geometry of a rectangular waveguide ( for the local analysis of quantum fields confined in rectangular cavities see @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "in the limit @xmath121 the main contribution into @xmath180 and @xmath179 comes from the term with @xmath129 and these quantities behave like @xmath123 . in the limit @xmath63 and for a massive scalar field the parts @xmath172 and @xmath181 are exponentially suppressed by the factor @xmath182 . in the same limit and for a massless field",
    "the main contribution comes from the summand with @xmath129 and these parts behave as @xmath125 .",

    "the graphs are given for the wedges with @xmath189 ( full curves ) and @xmath190 ( dashed curves ) and for @xmath191 .",
    "now we turn to the interaction forces acting on the cylindrical boundaries .",
    "these forces are determined by the @xmath192-component of the energy - momentum tensor evaluated on the corresponding surfaces .",
    "similar to the previous case , the effective pressure on the cylindrical shell @xmath113 is presented as the sum @xmath193where @xmath194 is the radial vacuum stress on the cylinder with the radius @xmath99 when the second cylinder is absent and @xmath195 is the additional stress on this cylindrical surface when the second cylinder is present .",
    "note that the off - diagonal component @xmath142 vanishes on the shell @xmath113 and does not contribute to the force .",
    "the part @xmath196 includes the self - action force on the cylindrical shell and belongs to the second group of quantities in the classification given in the previous section .",
    "its evaluation requires more realistic model for the interaction of the quantum field . unlike to the self - action force ,",
    "the interaction force given by the second term on the right of ( [ p1j ] ) is finite for all nonzero distances between the shells and can be evaluated by boundary condition calculations . from the last term on the right of ( vevemt_ii ) taking @xmath197 and @xmath113 one finds:@xmath198from this formula",
    "we see that @xmath199 and the corresponding forces are always attractive . the expression for the interaction forces between the cylindrical shells can also be written in the form@xmath200 ,   \\label{pjint1}\\]]where , as before , @xmath82 , @xmath83 . as for the forces acting on the wedge sides , the interaction forces do not depend on the curvature coupling parameter .",
    "now we consider the behavior of the interaction forces in asymptotic regions of the parameters . in the limit @xmath121",
    "the main contribution in the sum of formula ( [ deltap1j ] ) comes from the @xmath129 term and @xmath201 . for large values of the exterior shell radius , @xmath63 , and for a massive field",
    "the interaction forces @xmath202 are suppressed by the factor @xmath203 . in the same limit and for a massless field one",
    "has @xmath204 . for small values of the wedge opening angle , assuming that @xmath205 , in the way similar to that used for the estimation of the forces acting on the wedge sides , one finds@xmath206 in figure [ fig3 ] we have plotted the interaction forces acting on cylindrical shells , @xmath207 , as functions of @xmath208 for wedges with @xmath117 ( full curves ) and @xmath209 ( dashed curves ) and for @xmath210 in the case of @xmath162 massless scalar field .",
    "the curves a are for @xmath211 and the curves b are for @xmath212 .    note that in the geometry of two coaxial cylindrical shells without a wedge the corresponding interaction forces are given by the formula saha06cyl @xmath213where the prime on the sum sign means that the term @xmath214 should be halved . for @xmath162 massless scalar field and for @xmath210 from this formula",
    "we have @xmath215 and @xmath216 . as it has been shown in @xcite , the interaction forces ( [ pjj2cyl ] ) can also be obtained from the corresponding part in the total casimir energy differentiating over the radii of cylindrical shells . in the geometry under consideration in the present paper the casimir forces",
    "are position dependent on the boundary and can not be obtained by global methods using the total casimir energy .    in the limit @xmath217 , @xmath218 , assuming that @xmath219 and @xmath220 are fixed , from the formulae given above we obtain the corresponding results for the geometry of a rectangular waveguide with sides @xmath221 and @xmath222 . here",
    "we discuss this limiting transition for the case of the interaction forces @xmath223 .",
    "the consideration of the other quantities is done in the similar way . in the limit under consideration",
    "the parameter @xmath154 is large and we can replace the modified bessel functions by the corresponding uniform asymptotic expansions . by using these expansions",
    "it can be seen that to the leading order we have@xmath224introducing in ( [ pjjq ] ) a new integration variable @xmath225 and by making use of ( [ omlim ] ) , after some transformations , to the leading order we find@xmath226where @xmath227 .",
    "the expression on the right of this formula is the vacuum interaction force per unit surface between the facets of the rectangular parallelepiped separated by the distance @xmath221 and @xmath228 is the cartesian coordinate parallel to these facets .",
    "other facets of the parallelepiped are located at @xmath229 and @xmath230 . introducing in ( [ pjjlim ] ) @xmath231 and taking the limit @xmath232 with fixed value @xmath233 , from ( [ pjjlim ] )",
    "the vacuum forces for two infinite parallel dirichlet plates are obtained .",
    "note that the local vacuum densities for a quantum field confined within rectangular cavities are investigated in @xcite ( for corresponding global quantities such as the total casimir energy see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper we have considered one - loop quantum vacuum effects for a massive scalar field in the geometry of a wedge with two coaxial cylindrical shells .",
    "we have assumed that the field satisfies dirichlet boundary condition on the bounding surfaces .",
    "this geometry generalizes various special cases previously discussed in literature , including wedge - shaped regions , cylindrical boundaries , and rectangular waveguides .",
    "the most important local characteristics of the quantum vacuum are the vevs for the field square and the energy - momentum tensor . to evaluate these vevs , as the first step we construct the positive frequency wightman function .",
    "the corresponding eigensum contains a summation over the zeros of the combination of bessel and neumann functions .",
    "the application of the generalized abel - plana formula to the corresponding sum allows to present the wightman function in decomposed form given by formulae ( [ w4 ] ) and ( [ w5 ] ) . in this representations",
    "the first term on the right is the wightman function for the wedge without cylindrical boundary , the term @xmath234 is induced by a single shell with radius @xmath99 when the second shell is absent , and the last terms on the right are induced by the presence of the second shell . for points away from the shells the last two terms are finite in the coincidence limit and the renormalization is needed for the first term only . by taking the coincidence limit , we have obtained similar representations for the vevs of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor , formulae ( [ vevphi2 ] ) and ( [ vevemt ] ) .",
    "more symmetric decompositions are given by formulae ( interphi2 ) and ( [ tikren ] ) , where the last interference term is finite everywhere including points on the shells . in the limit @xmath121 the interference parts tends to zero like @xmath123 .",
    "for large values of the exterior shell radius , @xmath63 , the interference terms in the vevs behave as @xmath127 for a massive field and as @xmath235 for a massless one . for a wedge with small opening angle , @xmath205 , the main contribution into the interference parts of the vevs comes from the summands with @xmath129 and these parts",
    "are suppressed by the factor @xmath236 .    in section [ sec : forces ] we have considered the vacuum forces acting on constraining boundaries . in the geometry under consideration",
    "these forces are position dependent on the boundary and can not be obtained by global methods using the total casimir energy .",
    "the forces acting on the wedge sides are determined by the @xmath156-component of the vacuum energy - momentum tensor and are presented in the decomposed form ( [ p2wcyl ] ) . in this representation",
    "the first term on the right determines the force when the shells are absent and the second term is induced by the shells . in its turn",
    "the latter is decomposed into a single shell and second shell induced parts ( see formula ( [ p2 ] ) ) given by formulae ( [ p2cyla ] ) , ( [ p2cyljjp ] ) .",
    "both these forces are always attractive and do not depend on the curvature coupling parameter .",
    "further we consider the forces acting on the cylindrical shells .",
    "these force are presented in the form ( [ p1j ] ) where the first term on the right is the force acting on the cylindrical shell with radius @xmath237 when the second shell is absent and the second term is induced by the presence of the second shell .",
    "the latter , given by formula ( [ deltap1j ] ) , is always attractive and does not depend on the curvature coupling parameter . for large values of the parameter @xmath154 ,",
    "this part is suppressed by the factor @xmath155 . in the limit @xmath217 , @xmath238 , assuming that @xmath239 and @xmath240 are fixed , from the results of the present paper we obtain the corresponding formulae for the vevs in the geometry of a rectangular waveguide .",
    "we have demonstrated this on the example of the interaction force between the cylindrical shells .",
    "note that we have considered quantities which are well defined within the framework of standard renormalization procedure of quantum field theory without boundaries .",
    "we expect that similar results would be obtained from the model discussed in @xcite where instead of externally imposed boundary condition the fluctuating field is coupled to a smooth background potential that reproduces the boundary condition in a limiting case .",
    "the generalization of the results in the present paper for a scalar field with neumann boundary conditions is straightforward . for this case in the expressions ( [ eigfunc ] ) of the eigenfunctions the function @xmath241 stands instead of @xmath242 and the quantum number @xmath243 takes the values @xmath244 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues for @xmath38 are zeros of the function @xmath245 .",
    "the formula for the summation over these zeros is given in @xcite .",
    "the formulae for the wightman function and the vev of the field square in neumann case are obtained from the corresponding formulae for dirichlet scalar by the replacements @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath168 , and with the term @xmath214 included in the summation . in the expressions for the vevs of the energy - momentum tensor",
    "this leads to the change of the sign for the second term in the figure braces on the right of ( [ vevemt_ii ] ) and to the change of the sign for the off - diagonal component ( [ vevemt_12 ] ) .",
