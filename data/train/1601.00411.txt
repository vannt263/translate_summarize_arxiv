    "the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) has been a longstanding theoretical issue  @xcite . among sakharov",
    "s three conditions @xcite for successful generation of an asymmetry from a symmetric initial state , the first , i.e. baryon number violation , and the second , i.e. c and cp violation , rely most strongly on model building beyond the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics . along this line , there already exist plenty of theoretical models to generate the bau  @xcite , with different ways to depart from thermal equilibrium , e.g. from heavy particle decay outside equilibrium to first - order phase - transitions or to the dynamical affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism @xcite .    in this letter , we would like to follow an alternative route , realizing instead the leptogenesis mechanism within a phase with broken electro - weak symmetry at high temperature and relying mostly on sm physics in the neutrino sector to achieve the necessary cp - violation .",
    "the only ingredients beyond the sm that we need is the presence of various species of sm singlets , with the quantum numbers of right - handed(rh ) neutrinos , different higgs doublets , in order to allow for a non - vanishing contribution to the cp asymmetry from a @xmath0-boson loop and to keep the electroweak symmetry broken .",
    "indeed , at the level of the sm of particle physics , cp violation is related to the charged - current interaction and determined by two cp phases , one in the quark sector , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa  ( ckm ) phase @xmath1 @xcite and the other the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakada  ( pmns ) phase @xmath2 @xcite , while two more majorana phases are appearing in the leptonic sector . in a family unified grand unified theory ( gut ) , these two phases can be related if only one single complex vacuum expectation value(vev ) appears in the full theory @xcite . from the early time on , it has been an interesting issue to investigate a possibility of relating the baryon asymmetry with the sm phase(s ) @xmath1 or / and @xmath2 .",
    "the first obvious possibility is to exploit @xmath1 for the bau , but it has been known long time that such phase , appearing always with small mixing angles , is not enough for the baryon number generation in gut baryogenesis @xcite . even in other scenarios , relying on the quark sector , like the ad mechanism @xcite through baryon number carrying scalars or the electroweak baryogenesis , additional cp violating phases are needed to provide a large enough baryon asymmetry @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to explain the bau just considering the cp violation in the quark sector .",
    "a more promising road is given by baryogenesis through leptogenesis @xcite , since the phases in the leptonic sector are unconstrained and the mixings large .",
    "this mechanism relies on the fact that sphaleron processes are effective before / during the electroweak phase transition and violate both baryon  ( @xmath3 ) and lepton  ( @xmath4 ) numbers , but conserve baryon minus lepton number  ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore , baryogenesis or leptogenesis above the electroweak scale must generate a non - vanishing @xmath5 number , that is then translated into a baryon asymmetry before or at the electroweak transition .    in this paper",
    "we consider a leptogenesis scenario , which allows us to relate the cp - violation during leptogenesis to the phase @xmath2 in the light neutrino mixing matrix . in order to be able to have a well - defined neutrino mixing matrix when the lepton asymmetry is cosmologically created , we require that the sm gauge group   remains broken during the leptogenesis epoch .",
    "in fact , the brout - englert - higgs(beh ) mechanism for   breaking at high temperature is possible for some regions in the parameter space of beh bosons @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "in the leptogenesis scheme with one or two beh doublets , the lepton asymmetry arises from the decay of the lightest heavy majorana neutrino @xmath8 producing light leptons and antileptons and the higgs particle by the decay @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the i - th lepton ( antilepton ) doublet and @xmath6 is the up - type @xmath11 beh doublet .",
    "we follow here the supersymmetric notation , but the mechanism can work also without supersymmetry . in this case",
    "therefore the same mother particle @xmath12 has two decaying channels with different lepton number and therefore the model satisfies the nanopoulos - weinberg theorem @xcite . in classical leptogenesis ,",
    "the cp violation in the decay arises from the interference of the tree - level with the one - loop diagrams involving the heavier rh neutrinos @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( for the case of three generations ) and the cp violation arises in general from the complex yukawa couplings and has in general no direct relation to the low - energy cp - phases  @xcite , apart in case of particular textures  @xcite or cp conservation in the heavy rh neutrino sector @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we would like to extend the model in order to have a large contribution to the cp violation from an electroweak loop involving explicitly the pmns matrix . in order to do so",
    ", we introduce another copy of the higgs doublet @xmath15 , heavier than the sm one @xmath6 and with vanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , as well as another generation of rn neutrinos @xmath16 .",
    "all these particles can mix with @xmath17 respectively and allow for the presence of the diagram ( 2b ) in fig .  2 , where the virtual particles are all sm particles and one of the vertices include the pmns matrix directly .",
    "we consider here for simplicity the case where the field @xmath15 is heavier than the right - handed neutrino , so that the decay of @xmath18 into @xmath19 is negligible .",
    "the cp phase in the pmns matrix is required to descend down from high energy scale by a complex vev . to relate different phases , we assume that only one sm singlet field @xmath20 develops a cp phase @xmath21 .",
    "thus , all yukawa couplings and the other vevs are real and all cp violation parameters arise from @xmath21 .    while the sm higgs doublet(s ) do not carry lepton number , we define the fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 to carry the lepton number @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , and @xmath26 instead to have @xmath27 , while @xmath12 will be defined to carry @xmath28",
    ". we can then write for the higgs doublets and the heavy neutrinos the yukawa couplings : @xmath29 the yukawa couplings ( @xmath30 s ) of the inert higgs doublets @xmath31 to the lepton doublets are distinguished from those ( @xmath32 s ) of the beh doublets @xmath33 and no mixing is allowed at this level due to the different lepton number assignments .",
    "we have as well other lepton number conserving interactions as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is real .",
    "the first term of ( [ eq : ldef ] ) gives directly a majorana mass term between @xmath36 and @xmath16 without a phase because we defined it preserving the lepton number .",
    "the dirac mass for the seesaw neutrino mass is via @xmath37 which appears as in the ` type - i leptogenesis ' .",
    "the needed lepton number violating couplings are introduced by the couplings @xmath38 which allow for mixing also in the higgs sector and for the see - saw mechanism .",
    "there are more @xmath4 violating terms such as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which are not relevant for leptogenesis .",
    "we will assume @xmath41 , _",
    "i.e.  _ the @xmath4 conserving mass parameter is much larger than the @xmath4 violating mass parameters . in this case , @xmath42 are maximally mixed and we call @xmath12 the lightest mass eigenstate obtained from the mixing of these two states",
    ". we can then define an effective yukawa coupling for this lightest rh neutrino as @xmath43 by considering the large mixing angle @xmath44 between the neutrinos and also the small mixing between @xmath23 and @xmath6 .",

    "the yukawa coupling matrix of the doublet @xmath6 include powers of @xmath20 such that some symmetry behind the yukawa couplings is satisfied .",

    "more phases are present and a non - vanishing contribution from the classical loop with the heavier rh neutrinos states is present , the pmns phase could still represent the dominant part and allow for a direct correlation of the baryon asymmetry to neutrino observables .",
