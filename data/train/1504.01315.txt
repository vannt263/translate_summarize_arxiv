    "entanglement entropy associated to a region of the space @xmath4 has been extensively studied , where the degrees of freedom localized in that region are only taken into account and the rest is traced out . by using the von neumann definition of entanglement entropy @xmath5 $ ] , it is possible to quantify the inaccessibility to the full system , @xmath6 being the quantum state that results from the partial trace .",
    "this quantity has been widely used in several branches of physics , for example , quantum field theory ( qft ) ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and niza ) , condensed matter physics and black hole thermodynamics ( see met , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , eisert , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and in particular for free quantum field theory with temperature ( see @xcite , @xcite and cramer ) , in curved space - time ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , with excited states ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and non - lorentz covariant qft @xcite . in the context of quantum field theory , geometric entropy of the free klein - gordon field has been related to the bekenstein - hawing black hole ( @xcite and @xcite ) and in general , free models can reveal features that are common to all quantum field theories , in particular , the interacting ones . in @xmath7 dimensions",
    "it is shown that entropy behaves as a laurent series starting in @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a short - distance cutoff and the coefficients are functions on the boundary @xmath10 .",
    "the leading coefficient that multiplies to @xmath11 is proportional to the @xmath12 power of the size of @xmath4 , which is the area law for the entanglement entropy . in this work ,",
    "the entanglement between real particles and virtual particles is investigated , that is , the subsystems considered are not partial traces over region of space , but over the intermediate states that are necessarily introduced in the perturbation expansion . in this work ,",
    "the interacting @xmath0 field theory will be considered and the entanglement between external and internal propagators will be studied .",
    "although the virtual states are a mathematical artifact of the perturbative expansion of the correlation functions , these states contribute to the physical mass , the vacuum energy and the coupling constant . on the other hand , if virtual states are not real or they do not exist ( see @xcite ) , then it is feasible to trace out these states from the correlation function . in qft ,",
    "the particles that are created in these vertices are virtual particles because they are off shell ; that is , they do not obey the conservation laws . in this sense , the conceptual meaning of the partial trace of the internal degrees of freedom is to neglect the virtual nonphysical modes .",
    "this is consistent with the experiments of scattering because basically what is measured are the in and out states . in turn",
    ", the interpretation of the integration of the internal vertices is to sum over all points where this process can occur ( see @xcite , p. 94 ) . from the point of view of this work ,",
    "the integration over the internal vertices reflects the fact that the virtual degrees of freedom are eliminated . before computing the entanglement entropy , the quantum field theory formalism for a self - interacting system",
    "must be rewritten in a suitable way , which has been done in @xcite and @xcite with an application to nonrenormalizable theories in @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the model has been applied to the renormalization of @xmath0 theory , showing that the renormalization procedure is equivalent to a projector that neglects the diagonal part of the quantum state defined through the correlation function , which is in turn a specific representation of the operator @xmath13 defined in eq.(9.76 ) of @xcite . in @xcite ,",

    "the dirac delta that appears as the coefficient of the identity operator can be considered as a particular choice of observable that physically implies no measurement.or any other representation . ]",
    "the subscript @xmath41 in eq.([os8 ] ) refers to the external points @xmath42 and the subscript @xmath43 to the internal vertices @xmath44 .",
    "then , the generating functional of eq.([ideas7 ] ) can be written as the mean value of the quantum operator @xmath45 on the reduced operator @xmath46 as@xmath47where@xmath48where the subscript @xmath43 refers to the partial trace over the degrees of freedom that represents the internal vertices of the perturbation expansion .",
    "this reduced state contains the divergences of qft due to the correlation function @xmath15 that appears as the coefficient of the external reduced operator .",
    "what basically this model does is to duplicate the number of internal vertices .",
    "the new vertices are linked to the old vertices in such a way that identification one to one gives the feynman diagram again . in turn , the way in which the observable in eq.(os6 ) is written is suitable for a generalization , where the dirac delta distributions are replaced by some nicer well - behaved distributions .",
    "this could be interpreted as if the interaction has been smeared out ( see eq.(os1 ) ) , although this implies that a nonlocal interaction has been introduced .",
    "is considered , then the interaction term can be written as a mass term in the lagrangian , where the coefficient is @xmath49 , which acts in another space - time point .",
    "this means that the mass is not constant and depends on what happens with the quantum field in another point where the interaction occurs .",
    "this point will be considered in future works . ] this way of introducing the perturbation expansion of the generating functional of qft allows to discriminate the internal vertices from the external ones in a simple way through the observable of eq.([os8 ] ) .",
    "if the quantum operator @xmath50 is normalized , the generating functional can be interpreted as a mean value between an observable defined by eq.([os8 ] ) and a quantum density operator defined in eq.([os5 ] ) .",
    "this quantum density operator represent the probability amplitude for a particle to propagate from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , that is a distribution , that belongs to a  @xmath53 algebra and where all the machinery of the algebraic approach of qft can be applied to it .",
    "nevertheless is not the purpose of this work to discuss the algebraic and analytical properties of these states , although some issues will be considered .    as was shown in eq.([os11 ] ) , the mean value can be computed through a reduced quantum operator , where a partial trace over the internal degrees of freedom has been taken .",
    "this suggests that the partial trace over the external degrees of freedom can be considered as well .",
    "both partial traces can be used to compute the von neumann entropy defined as @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 are partial traces with respect the internal / external vertices respectively .",
    "this result could be important to understand the physical effects of virtual particles in real particles in the successive orders in the perturbation expansion and to obtain theoretical values of entanglement between these states .",
    "although the procedure introduced in this section is simple , an important point has to be considered and is the ambiguity in the choice of the operator function @xmath28 for a @xmath0 theory ( see eq.([os2 ] ) ) .",
    "as an example , for the case of the second order in the perturbation expansion with two external vertices and one internal vertex , the two operator functions imply the following open - loop connected feynman diagrams@xmath56and@xmath57which represent two different feynman diagrams , the first one with two external points and the second one with three external points .",
    "if we take the partial trace over the internal degrees of freedom we obtain the same reduced quantum state@xmath58@xmath59which is the first order contribution to the correlation function of two external points .",
    "this does not occur with the partial trace over the external degrees of freedom where two different results are obtained    @xmath60    and@xmath61 in turn , the trace of both quantum states gives the same result ( see figure [ estados])@xmath62        with these results , the only ambiguity is located in the partial trace over the external degrees of freedom which define the quantum state that represent only the internal vertices , which physically represent virtual propagation states .",
    "this could be related to the fact that in principle , the virtual states are an artifact of the perturbation expansion of the correlation function or perhaps that there are different ways of rearranging the internal vertices and links in such a way that the loop expansion of @xmath63 theory is obtained when the identification of internal and external vertices is done .",
    "this is particularly important when observables that depend on the quantum states are taken into account , for example the entanglement entropy . in this case",
    ", different values will be obtained for the external / internal entanglement entropies . in this work @xmath64 will be considered only and entanglement and relative entropies will be computed at linear order in @xmath65 .    a different point of view for the idea behind",
    "the manuscript is that the correlation function of @xmath0 theory is in fact the coefficient of a quantum density operator which is in turn a partial trace over a larger quantum operator .",
    "this quantum density operator is the correlation function for a nonlocal interaction @xmath66 or @xmath67 . in the first case ,",
    "the interaction is @xmath68 which contains its own feynman propagators . in other words ,",
    "the following process can be considered for the operator function @xmath69 :  a particle in a definite momentum is prepared in the infinite past .",
    "when the interaction is turned on , this particle annihilates and two more particles are created .",
    "if the propagation of one of the resulting particles is not taken into account , then the propagator becomes a loop and the first order in the perturbation expansion for the correlation function of two external points is obtained .",
    "to ignore one of the particles is identical to putting two observables , one in the infinite past and one in the infinite future that measure plane waves , that has some definite values of the momentum operator , or in terms of group theory , two possible values of the eigenvalues of the mass operator in the reference frame at rest of the poincar group , which is valid in the in and out states because the interaction goes to zero in those stages .",
    "one of the observables is the one which prepares the initial state and the second is the one that measures one of the particles that is a product of the interaction . in this sense , to take partial traces over the internal degrees of freedom is identical to make no measurement over the remaining particle , although it is there propagating in space - time .",
    "this point can not clarify the discussion about the reality of virtual states , but it gives a physical reason of divergences in qft :  when intermediate states are not measured they must be traced out , then loops appear and infinities proliferate . in turn , the model introduced above is suitable for a generalization of observables , in particular , those that prepare and measure in and out states and simultaneously have an effect over intermediate states in such a way to avoid divergences .    on the other hand , the partial trace over the external degrees of freedom can be interpreted as the following process :  a particle is prepared in a definite momentum in the infinite past and in a particular space - time point , it annihilates and two other particles are created . if this product of particles is not measured but an observable that measures the exact space - time point where the interaction occurs is introduced , that is , where the initial particle annihilates in two other particles , then the resulting quantum state is that of eq.([os17 ] ) . in the other case , where the trace is taken over the internal degrees of freedom , the observables only prepare and measure the in and out states , but in this case , one observable prepares a quantum state and the other observable measures the annihilation of the particle , which implies a measurement at one space - time point which would necessitate infinite energy .",
    "another important point is to note that by applying a wick rotation in the time coordinate , the generating functional of correlation functions is identical to the partition function of statistical mechanics",
    ". then it would be possible to study the entanglement of intermediate states , for @xmath70 the compton wavelength of the quanta which is the correlation length of statistical fluctuations and relate the results with those found in bran , where area law for entanglement is obtained by considering partial traces over regions of space dictated by the decay of the correlations .",
    "before computing the quantum entropy of the reduced quantum states , we must take into account the algebraic structure of the hilbert space .",
    "the quantum states can be written as@xmath72 = \\frac{1}{% tr(\\varrho ^{(n)})}\\underset{j=0}{\\overset{+\\infty } { \\oplus } } \\varrho ^{(n , i ) }   \\label{a1}\\]]where the supperscript @xmath73indicates the number of external points and @xmath74 indicates the order in the perturbation expansion .",
    "the coefficient of each quantum state will be of the form@xmath75the trace readsthat depend only on the two external points are the partial traces over the internal degrees of freedom.]@xmath76where @xmath77 is the weight factor ( see @xcite chapter 3 ) corresponding to the connected feynman diagram and @xmath78 is an operator that depends on the propagator of the respective feynman diagram . and @xmath79 ,",

    "because @xmath190 depends on @xmath191 , then the entropy computed in eq.(fi3 ) and eq.([e3.5 ] ) depends on @xmath229 and the mass scale @xmath227 considered . in all the cases , entropy has a minimum for a particular value of @xmath2 which decreases when @xmath227 increases .",
    "it should be clear that the lack of knowledge that leads to the entropy contribution at first order for the zero point correlation function comes from the absence of measurement of the propagation of a real particle from one space - time to another as can be seen from eq.([e2.1 ] ) .",
    "this measurement is not done at all because what is being considered is the process of vacuum to vacuum amplitude that occurs in short periods in time . in this case , the quantum entropy computed is not important .",
    "but it is useful in the case in which the virtual process converts to a real process , for example see @xcite , where the effect on the entanglement entropy of real particles coming from a common virtual pair is considered or the opposite process where a massive pseudoscalar particle decays into a particle - antiparticle pair ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , if the first order contribution to the vacuum correlation function is considered and one of the loop propagators is cut , then we obtain the partial trace over the internal degrees of freedom of the first order contribution of the two - point correlation function . if it is possible that some physical process that involves these two quantum states , for example a loop propagator converting in a real particle propagating in space - time then the entropy of both states can be computed separately as it was done in section ii and then compared .",
    "a relation between traces of @xmath230 , @xmath202 and @xmath231 can be found by noting that the trace over external points in @xmath202 or @xmath231 gives contributions to the perturbative expansion of @xmath232 . as an example , the first order contribution of @xmath233 can be considered @xmath234and we take the trace on the reduced state we obtain the trace        @xmath235    which is in fact one of the second order contributions to @xmath236 divided by @xmath109 ( see figure [ trazas ] , blue boxes)@xmath237that is@xmath238 in turn , the other contribution to @xmath239@xmath240is in fact proportional to the total trace of @xmath241 ( see figure [ trazas ] , black boxes)@xmath242that is is taken by considering identical arguments , that is @xmath243.]@xmath244 in a similar way , a relation between the connected feynman diagrams of @xmath88 , @xmath245 and @xmath215 correlation functions can be done , showing that a general expression can be obtained for a @xmath0 interaction in terms of the quantum state traces@xmath246   \\label{gc8}\\]]where the product of loop propagators @xmath247 corresponds to the trace of a free propagator multiplied by @xmath109 , which is the zero order @xmath169 in @xmath65 of the @xmath88 correlation function ( see figure [ trazas ] , the first feynman diagram of @xmath248 ) .",
    "the last equation can be related to the generation of correlation functions from vacuum diagrams ( see section 5.5 of @xcite , page 68 ) , where for example , by cutting one line to the first order vacuum diagram we obtain the first order contribution to the two - point function . in terms of quantum states ,",
    "the `` vacuum to two - point or four - point functions '' way can not be done because cutting a line implies introducing a new propagator , which implies the introduction of at least two quantum fields that act as external points in the correlation function and this , in algebraic terms , implies to introduce a new hilbert space in the algebraic structure .",
    "then , because the enlarged quantum state is not a tensor product of quantum states of each hilbert space , then there is no operation that allows finding the correlation functions from vacuum diagrams .",
    "the opposite way is the one introduced in eq.([gc1 ] ) to eq.([gc7 ] ) , where by using correlation functions it is possible to obtain the vacuum diagrams .",
    "in fact , because the procedure is the same and because the weight factors in each diagram match as it is pointed out in @xcite , then the weight factors match as in eqs.([gc1]-[gc7 ] ) , which enables us to obtain eq.([gc8 ] )",

    "in this work , the entanglement entropy between real and virtual propagating states has been computed by rewriting the generating functional of the @xmath257 theory in such a way to separate the internal propagators from the external ones by considering the initial and end points as labels of position states belonging to particular hilbert spaces .",
    "this formalism does not introduce new mathematical elements , but allows us to introduce the idea of observables that measure the in and out states and do not measure the intermediate states . in this way",
    ", the divergences of quantum field theory appear from the partial traces taken over the internal vertices of the respective feynman diagrams .",
    "entanglement entropy has been computed for two external points at first order in the perturbation expansion .",
    "it is shown that mutual information between real and virtual particles increase with bare mass and that the conditional entropy is negative , which implies that virtual and real particles are highly entangled . in turn , the entropy of a virtual process such as a vacuum to vacuum amplitude has been computed showing that minimum values are found for particular choices of mass factor @xmath228 .",
    "finally , general results can be found for total traces of quantum states that represent zero , two and four external point correlation functions .",
