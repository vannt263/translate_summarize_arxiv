    "two aspects of strong gravitational lensing that date back 25 years have attracted much recent interest .",
    "microlensing , or variations in the ( optical and/or x - ray ) fluxes of lensed quasar images that are induced by individual stars in the lens galaxy , was first discussed by @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon has now been observed in several lens systems @xcite . it can be used to learn about the stellar components @xcite and the relative densities of stars and dark matter @xcite in lens galaxies , and to probe structure in the source quasars at stunning micro - arcsecond resolution @xcite .",
    "central or `` odd '' lensed images were originally predicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if the inner surface mass density of a lens galaxy is shallower than @xmath5 and there is no point mass at the center , then lensing should always produce an odd number of images . nearly all observed lenses , however , exhibit two or four images .",
    "the prediction and observations can be reconciled by noting that one of the expected images should be very close to the center of the lens galaxy and demagnified by the high central surface density there ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that makes central images difficult to detect",
    " and indeed the first ones have only just been found .",
    "@xcite detected a central image at radio wavelengths in the asymmetric 2-image lens pmn j1632@xmath10033 , while @xcite detected a central image at optical wavelengths in the unusual 4-image cluster lens sdss j1004 + 4112 .",
    "our goal in this paper is to combine the two phenomena and study microlensing of central images .",
    "the issue is timely since central images are now being observed , and compelling since the images naturally form in regions where the density of stars is high and microlensing seems inevitable .",
    "we customize our calculations to the lens pmn j1632@xmath10033 , because it is both a known central image system and also a prototype for the sorts of systems that are expected to yield the most central images in the future @xcite . @xcite",
    "recently studied a wide range of mass models for pmn j1632@xmath10033 , which can be used to estimate the total convergence @xmath6 and shear @xmath7 at the positions of the images .",
    "the lens data , including the central image , are consistent with a simple power law surface mass density @xmath8 with @xmath9 , plus a small external tidal shear .",
    "table [ tbl : kapgam ] gives the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 for such a model , which we adopt as inputs for our microlensing simulations .    .",
    "total convergence @xmath6 , shear @xmath7 , and magnification @xmath10 for each of the three images in pmn j1632@xmath10033 , from spherical power law plus external shear lens models by @xcite .",
    "`` c '' indicates the central , highly demagnified image .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > \" , ]     this analysis confirms our guess that the matter at image c could be essentially all stars .",
    "by contrast , the galaxy appears to be concentrated enough that at image b the density is no more than half stars , and at the distance corresponding to image a the density is no more than 1% stars .",
    "when we combine the upper limits on @xmath0 with the @xmath11 versus @xmath0 curves in figure [ fig : sigvf ] , we obtain the upper bounds on the magnification dispersion listed in table [ tbl : smax ] .",
    "the bottom line is that microlensing is basically negligible for image a , but reasonably important for both images b and c. for large source sizes , the central image c is notably more affected by microlensing than the saddle image b , hence microlensing of such demagnified images can help reveal the source size .",
    "central lensed images , which are highly demagnified and naturally appear in places where the density of stars is high , are more susceptible to gravitational microlensing than the more familiar images that form at larger distances from lens galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is useful to understand microlensing of central images in detail .",
    "the microlensing magnification maps for demagnified images differ qualitatively from those for familiar magnified images in striking ways . for high fractional surface density in stars",
    ", the central image maps do not show any of the classic fold and cusp caustic structures , but rather have concentrated blobs of high magnification amid large regions of demagnification . as @xmath0 is decreased the maps begin to develop more and more cusps and folds .",
    "for the demagnified saddle , low values of @xmath0 yield cusps and folds , intermediate values produce blobs , and at very large values ( @xmath12 ) the cusps and folds reappear .",
    "thus the relative number of cusps and folds versus blobs has a complicated dependence on @xmath13 , @xmath7 , and @xmath0 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the central image c maps also show notable inhomogeneity on scales of tens of einstein radii .",
    "these large scale structures are evident in the 1@xmath1d auto - correlation function @xmath14 .",
    "for the central image c , @xmath15 falls to zero by @xmath16 along the direction parallel to the shear , implying structure sizes @xmath17@xmath18 .",
    "in contrast @xmath19 suggesting smaller structures with sizes @xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "the larger scale structures in the image c maps causes microlensing fluctuations to be larger for demagnified central images than for other images , even when the source is fairly large ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "our most intriguing qualitative result concerns the sensitivity of central image microlensing to the relative densities of stars and dark matter .",
    "when the source is large ( @xmath23 ) , the magnification dispersion decreases monotonically with the fraction @xmath0 of density in stars .",
    "however , when the source is small ( @xmath24 ) , the magnification dispersion _ rises _ as @xmath0 is decreased from unity , reaches a peak at some finite value of @xmath0 , and then falls to zero as @xmath25 ( as it should in the absence of microlensing ) .",
    "this dependence is similar to the behaviour seen by @xcite for a highly magnified saddle image .",
    "we do not see such behaviour for a demagnified saddle , but we do see it for a demagnified central image . while this qualitative result has little practical importance ( we expect @xmath26 for central images ) , it may be valuable as insight into how microlensing depends on the relative amounts of stars and dark matter .",
    "if we can develop a full understanding of that problem , we may be able to turn microlensing into the best tool available for probing local _ densities _ , rather than integrated masses , of dark matter in distant galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one practical goal of microlensing studies is to probe the structure of the optical continuum emission regions of quasars at very high effective spatial resolution .",
    "the light curves produced by relative motion of the lens galaxy and source quasar can be used to map out the ( 1-dimensional ) structure of the quasar on micro - arcsecond scales @xcite . in terms of raw variability amplitude",
    ", it would seem that central images are the best targets for microlensing observations . of course , there is the problem of detecting central images at optical wavelengths in the first place .",
    "a faint central image may be swamped by light from the lens galaxy .",
    "it may also be dimmed by extinction or scattering in the interstellar medium of the lens galaxy , although those effects might not be too much of a concern in the vast majority of lens galaxies that are ellipticals .",
    "it is interesting to consider the possibility that central image microlensing may allow us to probe the size of the _ radio _ emission region of the source quasar . for large sources the dispersion scales as @xmath4 , so for radio sources with @xmath27 we expect microlensing fluctuations to be no more than a few percent.434 .",
    "additionally , scintillation from the milky way may still have an appreciable effect at these source sizes for low galactic latitudes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "] for the case of pmn j1632@xmath10033 , the intensity of the central image is @xmath28750 and 500 @xmath10jy at 8 and 22 ghz , respectively @xcite , so microlensing fluctuations may be at the level of tens of @xmath10jy .",
    "presently , integration times for observing these fluctuations are prohibitively long for a monitoring campaign ( @xmath285 or 50 hrs at 8 or 22 ghz to resolve 5% fluctuations ) . however",
    ", next generation telescopes such as the evla or emerlin will make these observations feasible .",
    "our results allow us to consider how microlensing may affect various other applications that involve central lensed images .",
    "in pmn j1632@xmath10033 , the position and brightness of the central image lead to strong constraints on the density profile of the lens galaxy , and to upper limits on the mass of any supermassive black hole that may reside at the center of the lens galaxy @xcite .",
    "those constraints are based on radio data where , as noted above , the microlensing fluctuations are on the order of a few percent .",
    "however , even if they were as large as tens of percent , that would still be negligible compared with the orders of magnitude over which the macro magnifications of central images can vary due to modest changes in the smooth lens model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , microlensing does not appear to be a significant concern for constraints on lens models drawn from radio observations of central images .",
    "perhaps even more interesting is the possibility that any central macro image produced by a lens galaxy containing a supermassive black hole should be accompanied by a second , fainter central image @xcite , and that the central image pair can be used to measure the black hole mass quite precisely @xcite .",
    "the second central image would be a saddle rather than a maximum , so it would be interesting to consider whether a central saddle would have different microlensing properties than the central maximum we have considered .",
    "we suspect that , at the radio wavelengths where this application would be pursued , microlensing fluctuations are still small compared with changes in the smooth lens model .",
    "nevertheless , it would be interesting to understand in detail how microlensing of central saddles compares with microlensing of central maxima .",
