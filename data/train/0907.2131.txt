    "at the solar surface , strong magnetic fields emerge during the whole cycle , creating huge active regions with well - defined morphological and dynamical characteristics revealed by high resolution observations such as the 1 m swedish telescope in la palma @xcite and the hinode space telescope @xcite . in particular , according to joy s law , most bipolar structures statistically show an east - west orientation , with a small tilt angle of a few degrees , increasing with the latitude of emergence ( thus decreasing with the sunspots cycle ) .",
    "these active regions are believed to take part in the global dynamo process operating in the sun , and are the results of the buoyant rise of the strong toroidal fields generated at the base of the convection zone ( cz ) in the tachocline of shear via the so - called @xmath0-effect @xcite .",
    "active regions are thus thought to be the results of magnetic fields emerging at the photosphere during the whole sunspot cycle .",
    "observations indeed indicate that magnetic flux continuously emerges at the solar surface at all scales ( see * ? ? ?",
    "although the emergence rate at small scales strongly dominates over the emergence rate at large scale ( which produces active regions ) , the time scale of these large structures is much longer and they are thus likely to take part in the process of a global reconfiguration of magnetic fields in the chromosphere and the corona .",
    "violent events like cmes are a good example of the role of flux emergence at large scale since in most models of solar ejections , an emerging flux system is supposed to be the triggering mechanism . moreover , observations have shown that a certain amount of helicity of the magnetic structure could almost always be detected @xcite even if it seems to be relatively small ( according to chae & moon @xcite , a winding number of no more than 0.75 is usually observed over a whole active region ) . this particular ingredient is also thought to be responsible for the onset of some violent events like cmes through the kink instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "understanding the dynamical properties of these magnetic structures requires to investigate the rising mechanisms of strong toroidal structures through the turbulent solar convection zone ( see review of * ? ? ?",
    "many models carried out since the 80 s relied on the assumption that toroidal flux is organised in the form of discrete flux tubes which will rise cohesively from the base of the cz up to the solar surface ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* however for a less idealised view of the topology of buoyant flux structures ) .",
    "the first emergence models used the `` thin flux tube approximation '' @xcite in which the flux tube was treated as a one - dimensional magnetic object moving in an idealised solar convective envelope under the influence of magnetic buoyancy , tension , aerodynamic drag and the coriolis force .",
    "these models enabled to demonstrate that the initial strength of magnetic field was an important parameter in the evolution of the tube and that the active regions tilts could be explained by the action of the coriolis force on the magnetic structure @xcite . in the framework of thin flux tube ,",
    "choudhuri & gilman @xcite studied the evolution of magnetic flux from the base of the cz in a rotating background and showed that the trajectory of emergence was linked to the initial magnetic field strength .",
    "another parameter then appeared to be fundamental for the dynamical evolution of a flux tube : the twist of the field lines . in the absence of twist , the tube splits into two counter - rotating vortex tubes that move apart from one another horizontally and eventually cease to rise .",
    "this behaviour was analysed by schssler @xcite and longcope et al .",
    "@xcite and then emonet & moreno - insertis @xcite showed that a threshold for the amount of twist could be derived , that would ensure the coherence of the tube during its rise .",
    "three - dimensional simulations of @xmath0-loops however showed that this threshold is reduced by a sufficiently arched magnetic structure .",
    "this curvature is indeed also able to counteract vorticity generation due to the gravitational torque applied to the flux tube @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated multidimensional models @xcite in cartesian geometry were then developed and extended to the upper part of the cz and the transition to the solar atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , very few computations @xcite were performed to study the influence of convective turbulent flows on the dynamical evolution of flux ropes inside the cz and none was done in spherical geometry .",
    "the assumption that turbulent flows may not have any influence on the flux rise is only valid if the field strength is sufficiently in superequipartition compared to the kinetic energy of the strongest downflows and this argument is yet to be tested . above all , no model has ever self - consistently studied the effects of convection , rotation , mean flows , curvature forces and 3d in the full mhd approach .",
    "we propose to do so in this paper , using the ash code .",
    "such computations will allow us to assess for the first time the role of hoop stresses , coriolis force , convective plumes , turbulence , advection or shear by mean flows and sphericity on the tube evolution and on the subsequent emerging regions , along with the usual parameters such as field strength , twist of the field lines or magnetic diffusion .",

    "2 , we present the details of the simulation setup , including the equations solved , the background hydrodynamical model and the initial magnetic conditions . in sect .",
    "3 , we summarise the results obtained in the isentropic case , which will represent our reference case to which the convective cases will be compared . in sect . 4 , 5 , 6 and 7",
    "the results of the computations in a fully convective zone are presented , with a particular focus on the structure of emerging bipolar regions and the influence of mean flows on the magnetic field and finally in sect .",
    "8 , we discuss the results and interpret them in terms of dynamics of active regions in the sun .",

    "the reference state was obtained through the 1d cesam stellar evolution code @xcite which uses a classical mixing - length treatment calibrated on solar models to compute convection .",
    "we are dealing with the central portion of the convection zone but neglect for this work the penetrative convection below that zone or a stable top atmosphere .    the effective viscosity and diffusivity @xmath23 and @xmath24 are here taken to be functions of radius alone and",

    "the density contrast in this convective case is about 24 whereas it reaches a value of 40 in the isentropic case between the top and the bottom of the domain .",
    "figure [ figure_flux ] illustrates the contribution of various physical processes to the total energy flux through the shell , converted to luminosity and normalised to the solar luminosity , in both the isentropic and the convective model .",

    "the thermal diffusivity @xmath20 is derived from a 1d calibrated solar structure model @xcite computed with the cesam stellar evolution code @xcite .",
    "we adjusted it so that the radiative flux is equal to the total flux in the whole layer in the isentropic case and is equal to the total flux at the base of the cz for the convective case .",
    "in the latter case , the adjustment compared to the value obtained from the 1d model is small .",
    "the unresolved eddy flux @xmath97 is the heat flux due to sgs motions , which in our les approach , takes the form of a thermal diffusion operating on the mean entropy gradient @xcite .",
    "its main purpose is to transport energy outward through the impenetrable upper boundary where the convective fluxes @xmath94 and @xmath95 vanish and the remaining fluxes are small .    on fig.[figure_flux ] , the flux balance is represented at the time the system has reached a statistical steady state . in the isentropic case , as we do not have convection , we note that the energy is exclusively transported by radiation , explaining why the total flux is equal to the radiative flux in this case .",
    "contrary to the isentropic case , we note that several fluxes play a role in the fully convective model .",
    "the convective flux has developed to reach an equivalent luminosity of almost 110@xmath99 of the solar luminosity in the middle of the shell and the radiative and unresolved eddy fluxes carry the energy at , respectively , the bottom and the top of the domain where the enthalpy flux vanishes .",
    "the viscous flux @xmath98 is relatively small and slightly negative in most of the domain and the kinetic energy flux @xmath95 is , on the contrary , clearly negative in the whole convection zone .",
    "the asymmetry between the fast downflows and the broad slower upflows is responsible for the fact that the kinetic energy flux is negative .",
    "the very low value of @xmath98 confirms that the reynolds number of these simulations is much greater than unity .    in the convective case , where different physical processes play a significant role to transport the energy , large scale flows such as differential rotation and meridional circulation ( mc )",
    "are being created due to the action of convective motions . in brun & toomre ( 2002 )",
    ", it has been shown that convection under the influence of rotation leads to an efficient redistribution of angular momentum , energy and heat .",
    "it is found that reynolds stresses are at the origin of the equatorial acceleration of the solar convection zone , opposed by both the meridional circulation and viscous transport , the latter being negligible in the latest solar simulations @xcite .",
    "it was also found that the latitudinal enthalpy ( convective ) flux is at the origin of the variation of entropy and temperature as a function of latitude , leading to warm poles and cool equatorial regions @xcite .",
    "these thermal variations yield baroclinic effects that break the taylor - proudman constraint of invariance along the axis of rotation .",
    "figure [ figure_lsf ] illustrates the convective structure and the associated differential rotation and meridional flow realised in our simulations .",
    "the convective patterns are complex , time dependent and asymmetric owing to the density stratification , consisting of relatively weak , broad upflows with narrow , fast downflows around their periphery . by imposing in this model a weak entropy variation at the base of the convection zone , which mimics the presence of the tachocline",
    ", we were able to get an even more solar - like angular velocity profile ( see miesch * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the relative amplitude of this imposed variation corresponds to a pole - equator temperature difference of about 10 k. the second panel of fig .",
    "[ figure_lsf ] thus shows the differential rotation profile which is in good agreement with the solar internal rotation profile inferred from helioseismology @xcite . in this figure ,",
    "the angular velocity of the rotating frame is 414 nhz , corresponding to a rotation period of 28 days , the angular velocity contours at mid - latitudes are nearly radial and the rotation rate decreases monotonically with increasing latitude as in the sun .",
    "the induced meridional circulation shown on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figure_lsf ] exhibits a complex profile , multicellular both in latitude and in radius .",
    "nevertheless , close to the equator , a poleward flow of about @xmath100 strongly dominates at the surface , which is in agreement with helioseismic inversions .",
    "the fully convective model is thus far more complex that the isentropic one .",
    "continuously the dynamics is maintained with turbulent convection , heat and angular momentum redistribution , leading to the presence of large - scale flows and asymmetric up and down flows whose various effects on a magnetic flux rope will be studied .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarise the results obtained in the calculations of jouve & brun @xcite concerning the influence of the twist of the field lines , of rigid rotation and of the initial latitude of the flux rope on its dynamical evolution in a stably stratified layer . that will ease the comparison with the convective case and complete our study with new isentropic models .",
    "indeed , we have decided that the simulations would be more realistic if the tube radius was reduced to @xmath101 . in section [ sect_dif ] , we will comment specifically on the effects of the tube radius on its evolution .",
    "emonet & moreno - insertis @xcite showed that vorticity generation in the flux tube was controlled by the competition between the gravitational torque and the magnetic tension .",
    "consequently , by setting the gravitational torque to be equal to the projection of the lorentz force in the equation for the azimuthal vorticity , we can determine the threshold above which the twist of the field lines can counteract the creation of two counter vortices inside the tube .",
    "we derive the following inequality for the pitch angle value :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the pressure scale height at the base of the cz , @xmath104 is the density deficit inside the tube compared to the background stratification divided by the background density at the tube center and @xmath105 is the plasma-@xmath105 associated with the tube . in our case , the threshold value is equal to @xmath106 ( corresponding to a pitch angle of 17.4@xmath107 ) . in most twisted cases , we use for @xmath108 a value of @xmath109 ( corresponding to a pitch angle of 30 @xmath107 ) , i.e. well above the threshold , so that the tube is able to rise cohesively through the entire cz .    rotation has also an important dynamical effect on the trajectory of the tube .",
    "indeed , as shown in jouve & brun @xcite in the non - rotating case , the latitudinal component of the magnetic curvature acts to drag the tube poleward as it can not be compensated by any equatorward force ( hoop stresses ) . in the rotating case",
    ", a retrograde zonal flow is created inside the tube which induces a coriolis force directed towards the sun s rotation axis which acts to deflect the trajectory of the tube poleward .",
    "thus , we note that the deviation to the radial trajectory in this case is even more pronounced",
    ".    moreover , we also showed in jouve & brun @xcite that the rotation has an impact on the rise time of the tube .",
    "indeed , the radial component of the centrifugal force decreases the tube velocity so that after 6 days of evolution , the rise velocity of the tube in the non - rotating case is about 1.5 times that of the tube in the rotating case .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the buoyancy term is modified by an extra term coming from the rotation which has the effect of limiting the efficiency of buoyancy .",
    "the flux tubes thus emerge more slowly in the rotating case .",
    "we also investigated how flux tubes react when they are introduced at various latitudes .",
    "we find that the poleward drift due both to the uncompensated magnetic curvature force ( hoop stresses ) and the coriolis force varies as a function of the latitude of introduction of the tube . as moreno - insertis et al .",
    "( 1992 ) indicate , we can understand the poleward drift in writing the equation for the @xmath110-component of the velocity in the non - rotating case , neglecting the advection terms :    @xmath111    this equation indicates that the acceleration in the @xmath110-direction is proportional to @xmath112 which is a decreasing function of @xmath110 between @xmath63 and @xmath113 .",
    "as @xmath110 is here the colatitude , the acceleration at higher latitudes is thus more rapidly active than at low latitudes and as a consequence , the poleward drift is much more visible for a flux tube originally located at high latitudes .",
    "as choudhuri & gilman @xcite first demonstrated using the thin flux tube approximation and as fan ( 2008 ) and jouve & brun @xcite confirm with 3d mhd simulations , the initial strength of the magnetic field introduced at the base of the convection zone has a strong influence on the rising trajectory of the flux rope .",
    "we thus computed a new isentropic case where the initial field strength is @xmath114 and found that in this case , as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ figure_radial ] , the tube is strongly deviated from the radial trajectory and tends to follow a path which is parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "the deviation to the radial trajectory is due to the creation inside the tube of a retrograde zonal flow @xmath115 as soon as the magnetic structure begins its rise through the isentropic layer , as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ figure_vphi ] .",
    "the creation of this retrograde flow is the result of the conservation of the total angular momentum @xmath116 inside the tube .",
    "its main effect is to locally create a coriolis force oriented toward the solar rotation axis .",
    "this coriolis force then partially compensate the component of the buoyancy force , perpendicular to the rotation axis whereas the component parallel to the rotation axis remains the same .",
    "as soon as this compensation becomes significant , the tube is strongly influenced by the component of the buoyancy force parallel to the rotation axis and thus drifts away from the radial trajectory .",
    "we note that @xmath117 inside the tube is more and more negative to compensate for the creation of angular momentum due to the increase of @xmath118 for most cases .",
    "however , in the extremely high latitude case ( @xmath119 ) , @xmath117 inside the tube first increases .",
    "this is due to the fact that for this case , the curvature force is first acting to make the tube drift poleward ( since the curvature force acts faster at high latitudes ) , so that @xmath120 decreases faster than @xmath121 increases , leading to a decrease of @xmath122 which has to be compensated by a prograde zonal flow . for this case",
    ", @xmath117 in the tube increases until @xmath118 becomes constant and then begins to increase and only then do we recover the same behaviour as tubes introduced at lower latitudes .",
    "nevertheless , the initial magnetic field strength plays a role in this force balance . if the tube is weak like in the case of fig .",
    "[ figure_radial ] where @xmath123 , the coriolis force created by angular momentum conservation is sufficiently strong to compensate the weak buoyancy force and the main component which acts on the tube will make it rise parallel to the rotation axis , which is consistent with the results of fan ( 2008 ) .    for the rise to be radial ,",
    "we need to introduce sufficiently strong magnetic tubes .",
    "we found a threshold of @xmath124 for the initial value of the magnetic field inside the tube .",
    "for the following calculations , we thus impose an initial value above this threshold so that active regions will emerge close to the latitude where the tube was introduced .",

    "we compute a series of models where the tube is introduced in the cz after the convection and the mean large scale flows have self - consistently developed and we compare the results with reference cases in which we do not have convection .",

    "[ figure_posl ] shows that the tube has been squeezed at its apex and thus develops an oblate shape during its rise .",
    "moreover , the periphery of the tube , where the magnetic field is much lower than in the apex , has thus more difficulties to make its way through the convective zone and consequently has the tendency to be dragged downwards , contrary to the rising apex .",
    "if we look closely at the convective pattern , the downward advection of the tube periphery can be easily related to the downflows appearing at each side of the tube as it rises .",
    "we then clearly see that the background convection is strongly affected by the presence of the confined magnetic field .",
    "when the magnetic structure begins its evolution , it creates its own local velocity as we can see on the first panels of fig .",
    "[ figure_posl ] , due to the back reaction of the lorentz force on the velocity field .",
    "this velocity field due to the lorentz force consists in a strong upflow in the central region ( the apex ) and two downflows at each side of the tube .",
    "the study of the momentum equation shows that this particular configuration of the velocity is a direct consequence of the presence of the latitudinal gradient of @xmath54 in the equation for @xmath159 , which changes sign twice across the tube section . in the isentropic case , the same type of velocity field created by the presence of the magnetic tube appeared during the evolution but in this case , this configuration was much more symmetric with respect to the apex of the tube since the only background velocity was due to the tube .",
    "on the other hand , in the convective case , the velocity field created by the tube is an additional velocity to the background convection and thus a clear asymmetry is visible in the velocity field with respect to the apex . here ,",
    "especially if we focus on the 3 lower panels showing the last days of evolution , we note that the two downflows at each side of the tube are very different in extension and shape , leading to a very distorted aspect of the tube by the time it reaches the top of the domain .",
    "the effect of the coriolis force consisting in deflecting the tube poleward is thus less visible than in the isentropic case since now the velocity field in the meridian plane also plays a very significant role in the dynamical evolution of the flux tube , as we will discuss more in section [ sect_meanflows ] .",

    "this view enables to observe the longitudinal deformation of the magnetic field due to convective up and downflows . since our aim is to understand how active regions could be created at the solar surface , the study of the longitudinal deformation of the tube while it rises is of major interest .",
    "the cut of the magnetic energy and @xmath159 is made at @xmath154 of latitude , where we introduce the tube initially .",
    "we thus recover on each panel of figure [ figure_eqsl ] the strong upflow we could see on the previous figure centered at the apex of the flux tube . tracking a particular upflow ( red arrow on each panel ) and a particular downflow ( black arrow ) enables us to focus on the strong correlation existing between the regions where the magnetic structure is lifted ( pinned down ) and the convective upflows ( downflows ) .",
    "indeed , at the location of the strong downflow , the field lines are squeezed and thus retained in the solar interior , even if the tube is still globally subject to magnetic buoyancy .",

    "( 2003 ) . in this region ,",
    "even if the tube locally creates an upflow , it is not sufficient to counteract the strong background downflow and this portion of the structure is thus clearly pinned down by convection and will eventually rise significantly slower than the surrounding regions . on the contrary , the strong upflow which owes its origin both to the background convection and to",
    "the presence of the magnetic field clearly drags the field lines upward and will most probably favour flux eruption at the photosphere .",
    "we moreover see on fig .",
    "[ figure_eqsl ] that convective plumes drift longitudinally in time due to the presence of rotation .",
    "this constitutes a major difference with previous cartesian study where the convective structures were not influenced by rotation .",

    "a rough calculation of the drifting time of convective plumes in the middle of the convective zone at the latitude of @xmath162 shows that a convective plume could drift along @xmath163 longitudinally during this particular flux tube evolution ( which lasts about 10 days ) .",

    "since the initial field strength is relatively weak in this case , the convective motions first deform the tube in longitude , then the strong downdrafts pin the tube down and finally the rope loses its buoyancy by magnetic dissipation before it is able to rise through the entire convection zone .",
    "the rope is thus unable to rise to the top of the domain in this case where b is @xmath166 times the equipartition field .",
    "on the contrary , when the field is very strong compared to the equipartition field ( last panel of fig.[figure_updown ] ) , the background velocity field has almost no effect on the behaviour of the rope .",

    ", the velocity created by the tube itself is of the same order as the background velocity and the convective motions are thus able to strongly influence the tube during its dynamical evolution inside the cz .",
    "this is an interesting behaviour since even if the tube is introduced axisymmetrically , some longitudes can be favoured and structures will be able to emerge only in few places at the solar surface , thus creating localised active regions .",
    "as we saw , while it rises , the flux tube creates its own local velocity field which may strongly disturb the background velocity field , especially when the initial magnetic field intensity is strong compared to that of the equipartition field .",
    "this explains why the tube is more or less influenced by the convective motions as it evolves in the cz .",
    "indeed , if the magnetic energy of the tube is strong compared to the kinetic energy of the strongest downdrafts , the tube creates a velocity through the action of the lorentz force which dominates against the background purely hydrodynamically - generated velocity . since a strong upflow",
    "is thus created near the tube axis , the rising mechanism is very efficient and the tube reaches the top of the cz in only 4 days . in the weaker cases , the velocity field created by the magnetic structure is comparable to the background velocity field and",
    "the latter is thus able to influence the behaviour of the flux rope as it rises , the rise time is in this case of about 12 days .",
    "we now turn to discuss the characteristics of active regions created by the buoyantly rising magnetic structures .",
    "we especially focus on the field strength , the orientation and the later evolution of the bipolar active regions . however , it has to be clarified that since our upper boundary lies at about 28 mm below the actual solar surface , what we call `` flux emergence '' here is the emergence through the top of the computational domain , which is likely to be different from the emergence in the real photosphere .",
    "figure [ figure_shsl ] shows a zoom , seen from above , of an emerging bipole near the top of the domain . on this figure",
    "the radial field @xmath54 is shown , superimposed to the background radial velocity .",
    "we can here focus on the change in the convective patterns as the flux tube emerges , on the influence of particular downflows on the magnetic structure and on the late evolution of the magnetic field after the emergence .        on this figure",
    ", we clearly note that the emerging phase is characterised by the appearance of the bipolar patch in a very localised portion of the ( @xmath167 ) plane which in turn locally modifies the convective patterns .",
    "we again recover the strong upflow created by the tube and located at its apex and the downflows which appear at each side of the emerging tube .",
    "we then note that the convection organises itself very differently around the magnetic field .",
    "the strong central upflow significantly influences the background velocity field : for example , the strong downflow located on panel a ) ( before emergence ) around the longitude of @xmath119 and the latitude of @xmath154 is modified by the appearance of magnetic structures on panel b ) , the downflow is squeezed and becomes less intense in the area where the tube emerges . however , this downflow is so strong at the beginning that in spite of the influence of the magnetic field , we recover its imprint during the whole evolution on all the panels . on the other hand ,",
    "the upflows which were already present before the arrival at the top of the domain of the magnetic structure are enhanced by the flux emergence and for example the patch of positive radial velocity located in the middle of the first panel stays very strong during the whole evolution because it is reinforced by the emergence of the bipolar structure .",
    "the magnetic field has thus a strong influence on the modification of the convective patterns at the top of the domain but we can also focus on the influence of convection on the deformation of the rope and on its late evolution . indeed , the strong downflows are clearly the areas where the magnetic structures have more difficulties to emerge whereas strong upflows make it very easy for the bipolar patches to appear from the beginning . on panels b ) and c ) in particular ,",
    "we clearly see the emergence of two active regions separated by a strong downflow which causes the central area to stay deeper down in the interior .",
    "the tube thus emerges in a particular shape , with 2 distinct bipolar patches appearing and then evolving differently .    the late evolution of the flux tube after emergence also presents some interesting properties .",
    "on the first panels ( b ) , c ) and d ) ) , the field which is brought to the surface by magnetic buoyancy dominates the evolution of the simulation since it strongly perturbs the convective motions . at this stage , we can note that the tube evolution will remain dominated by the convective motions since the diffusive time scale at the surface for regions occupying about @xmath168 in longitude is of the order of 45 days , much higher than the advection time ( of the order of a few days ) .",
    "as the simulation evolves , the magnetic field begins to be advected horizontally by convection which tends to separate the two opposite polarities of the bipolar patches ( panels e ) and f ) ) .",
    "panels g ) and h ) then show the behaviour of the magnetic field and the radial velocity about 7 days after the first signs of emergence . on these panels ,",
    "the field lines become stretched by the convective motions and advected towards the strong downdrafts .",
    "we then recover some features of magneto - convection when the magnetic field is less organised than one well - defined flux tube .",
    "indeed , at this stage of evolution , the structure is much less coherent , it begins to occupy a very wide band in latitude because of the redistribution by convection .",
    "figure [ figure_shsl3d ] enables to see the 3d emergence of the bipolar structures , in showing the magnetic field lines reconstruction immediately below and above the top of our computational domain , at different times in the emergence process .",
    "panel a ) corresponds to the first signs of emergence , we clearly note ( like panel b of fig . [ figure_shsl ] ) the north - south orientation of the bipolar patches , which becomes more and more east - west as the emergence proceeds , as is shown on panels b ) and c ) . on these panels ,",
    "the complicated structure of the flux rope starts to be visible in the interior .",
    "indeed , we note the modulation both in latitude and in longitude of the tube when it reaches the top of the domain .",
    "panel c ) shows that the magnetic field of the tube connects with the external field during the emergence , even if some parts of the rope stay hidden in the solar interior and are not able to rise anymore . in particular , the fact that the tube axis dos not emerge and that only the upper part of the rope is visible outside the computational domain is probably responsible for the predominantly north - south orientation of the emerging patches .",
    "this remark thus leads us to analyse in more details the evolution of the tilt angle and of other characteristics of the emerging regions , in the same spirit of the observational studies of kosovichev & stenflo @xcite .            using a series of 96-min cadence magnetograms form",
    "soho / mdi , they analysed 715 active regions in terms of the evolution of the tilt angle , of the amount of emerging flux and of the magnetic polarities separation during emergence .",
    "we thus proceed to the same kind of analysis on our particular portion of magnetic field emerging between the longitudes of 55 and 65 degrees on panel b ) of fig .",
    "[ figure_shsl ] .",
    "we have to keep in mind that the emergence through our upper boundary ( which still lies well inside the cz ) is difficult to compare directly to observed flux emergence at the photosphere .",
    "however , this type of analysis enables us to get a better insight into the processes playing a role in the evolution of magnetic flux ropes well below the photosphere , thus allowing to predict some characteristics of the structures which will actually emerge through the upper layers .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown on fig .",
    "[ figure_shslflux ] .",
    "this figure shows the evolution of the total unsigned flux ( together with the contribution of the positive and negative polarities ) , the tilt angle and the magnetic polarities separation .",
    "the amount of flux first sharply increases during the first 3 or 4 days after the first signs of emergence and then reaches a saturation and starts to decrease as the opposite magnetic polarities stop separating .",
    "after about 4 days after emergence , the separation between the two opposite polarities is not modified by emergence anymore and the concentrations of radial field start to be advected by convection and by magnetic diffusion on a longer time scale than the rise time of our flux rope , leading to a saturation of the footpoints separation visible on the last panel of fig .",
    "[ figure_shslflux ] .",
    "finally , we investigate the evolution of the tilt angle of our emerging bipolar region and note that the orientation is mainly north - south on the first days of emergence ( the tilt angle is then equal to about @xmath169 ) .",
    "bipolar regions are thought to be the imprints of the flux tube axis emerging , creating a positive radial field at one foot of the emerging loop and a negative radial field at the other foot . in these simulations",
    ", we do not clearly see the axis of the tube emerging , the radial field which is observed is the one existing at the apex of the tube because it is twisted .",
    "however , as the emergence proceeds , we see that the orientation of the bipolar structure changes because of the convective motions , the 2 polarities are advected more and more independently and the orientation becomes more east - west ( a tilt angle of @xmath170 is reached when the active region begins its decay ) both because the structure is made sufficiently arched by the radial velocity and because the horizontal velocity acts differently on the 2 regions of opposite polarity . by applying the same kind of analysis for particular active regions created by tubes initially located at the latitudes of @xmath171 ( case cat45 ) and @xmath172 ( case cat15 )",
    ", we can assess how the tilt angle changes as a function of the initial latitude .",
    "we do not see a clear difference in the tilt angle for case cat45 in comparison to case cat described above , mainly because their rise time , the amount of flux emerging and the arching of the magnetic structure are similar .",
    "we thus not clearly see different effects of the physical processes involved to modify the tilt angle ( coriolis force , advection by convection , twist of the field lines ) between these 2 cases . on the other hand , in case cat15 , where the tube is introduced at the latitude of @xmath172 , the tilt angle reaches a smaller value ( about @xmath173 when the active region starts to decay ) .",
    "this can be explained mainly by the difference in the rise time of this particular tube compared to the others , as we will discuss in detail in sect .",
    "[ sect_difrot ] .",
    "since the rise time for this tube is longer , the coriolis force may have the time to significantly affect the tube orientation when it reaches the surface .",
    "moreover as we will see in sect .",
    "[ sect_dif ] , magnetic diffusion plays the role of untwisting the flux ropes . since the rise time is longer in this case , diffusion has acted more on this tube and the tube appears less twisted when it emerges , which leads to a tilt angle reduced in comparison to the cases at higher latitude .",
    "this particular feature may be in agreement with joy s law which states that bipolar structures emerging at lower latitudes have a smaller tilt angle than regions emerging at higher latitudes at the beginning of a new solar cycle .",
    "the initial magnetic field strength has a strong influence on the way the structure will emerge as it reaches the top of the computational domain , thus creating active regions with various morphological and dynamical characteristics .",
    "figure [ figure_emerge ] shows the radial magnetic field close to the top of the shell by the time the axis of the flux rope is situated approximately at @xmath174 , for cases cat and cbt .",
    "when the tube is strong , the tube emerges at all longitudes with very small azimuthal modulation even if the strong downflows have been able in some portions of the tube to keep it from emerging as fast as in the upflow regions .",
    "we also notice that the flux rope emerges at approximately the latitude of introduction , no poleward slip is thus visible in this case . on the contrary , in the weak b case",
    ", some longitudes are clearly favoured and some active regions can be identified .",
    "we indicated on fig .",
    "[ figure_emerge ] the intensity of the emerging @xmath54 , which is about a few kilogauss in case cat . on the other hand ,",
    "when the tube is introduced with a flux of about @xmath175 , as in the strong b case , the emerging radial field is of the order of a few tens of kilogauss . in this case",
    ", a strong flux loss would then have to be experienced by the tube during its rise up to the photosphere to match the observations of sunspots magnetic field at the solar surface .",
    "we also note that in the weak b case , the latitude of emergence is slightly higher than the latitude of introduction of the flux tube at certain longitudes .",
    "indeed , we see on the bottom panel of fig.[figure_emerge ] that the emerging structures appear at latitudes higher than the latitude of introduction ( @xmath154 ) . this drift could be explained partly by the poleward slip instability and the action of the coriolis force which were already observed in the isentropic case but may also be due to the action of the mean meridional flow as we now discuss in section [ sect_meanflows ] .",
    "as stated in sect . [ sect_hydro ] , convection in a spherical shell establishes and continuously maintains mean flows .",
    "we wish to take benefit of our self - consistent simulations to address the question of how meridional flows and differential rotation may influence the tube - like structure during its rise through the cz .",
    "the results coming from the study of flux tubes in a stably stratified spherical layer in jouve & brun @xcite showed that the dynamical evolution of flux tubes could be modified if they were introduced at various latitudes .",
    "indeed , for instance , we saw that the poleward drift was more rapidly active for tubes introduced at high latitudes , thus leading to a strong deviation of these tubes to their radial trajectory . in the fully convective cases",
    ", we saw that the convective patterns as well as the profile of the large - scale flows strongly varied in latitude and longitude ( see fig.[figure_lsf ] ) .",
    "it is thus likely that the differences between tubes introduced at various latitudes will be even more pronounced in these cases .     versus time , the second panel is the velocity of the tube versus time and the last panel shows the difference between the position in latitude of the max of @xmath158 and the latitude of introduction.,title=\"fig : \" ]   versus time , the second panel is the velocity of the tube versus time and the last panel shows the difference between the position in latitude of the max of @xmath158 and the latitude of introduction.,title=\"fig : \" ]   versus time , the second panel is the velocity of the tube versus time and the last panel shows the difference between the position in latitude of the max of @xmath158 and the latitude of introduction.,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure [ figure_latitude ] shows the temporal evolution of weak tubes initially located at the latitude of @xmath172 , @xmath162 , @xmath171 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "the first panel shows the position in radius of the maximum of @xmath158 ( corresponding to the location of the tube axis ) as the tube rises through the cz , the second panel indicates the rise velocity of each tube and finally the third panel represents the deviation in latitude of the position of @xmath178 compared to the latitude of introduction .",
    "we confirm that tubes introduced at various latitudes have different evolutions .",
    "looking at panels 1 and 2 , we see that the tube initially located close to the equator ( at @xmath172 ) can be clearly distinguished from the others , especially in the convective case .",
    "this tube indeed reaches its maximal velocity before the others and the decelerating phase is so significant that it almost stops rising after it has reached the middle of the convection zone . after 8 days of evolution , its rise velocity indeed becomes very weak ( about @xmath179 ) and the radial position of the tube axis reaches its maximum at about @xmath180 in the cz . on the other hand , the three tubes initially located in the upper part of the northern hemisphere keep on rising until the tube periphery reaches the top boundary condition where the radial velocity vanishes .",
    "this difference between tubes introduced at various latitudes is less significant in the isentropic case .",
    "for example , after 9 days of evolution in an isentropic layer , the distance travelled by a tube introduced at @xmath181 is @xmath182 less than that of a tube introduced at @xmath183 . in the convective case",
    ", this difference reaches @xmath184 .",
    "this may be explained by the presence of a differential rotation in the convective case .",
    "we showed in the isentropic case that the buoyancy term appearing in the evolution of the radial velocity was proportional to @xmath185 with @xmath110 the colatitude and @xmath0 the rotation rate .",
    "we showed that at constant @xmath0 , an increase in the colatitude @xmath110 caused a decrease of this term and thus of the efficiency of buoyancy , resulting in a slower emergence at higher colatitude or lower latitude . in this convective case here ,",
    "a solar - like differential rotation is present in the bulk of the cz .",
    "the profile of this differential rotation is conical between @xmath186 and @xmath176 and cylindrical under @xmath186 .",
    "this differential rotation may explain the major reduction of velocity in the cases at low latitudes in comparison to the cases at high latitudes as the strong rotation at low latitudes is very likely to decrease the rise velocity of the tube to such a point that it is not able to rise through the upper part of the cz .",
    "however , the effect of the centrifugal force which modifies the buoyancy may be weak compared to the total gravitational acceleration and thus the slowdown of tubes introduced in a convective background could also be caused by the coriolis force due to the retrograde flow created along the tube .",
    "panel 2 shows that because of the convective downdrafts acting to pin the flux tube down , the rising velocity is reduced compared to the isentropic case .",
    "indeed , when the tube was introduced at @xmath171 , it reached a maximal velocity of about @xmath187 while the maximal velocity is only @xmath188 in the convective case , i.e. @xmath189 less . for a tube introduced at the latitude of @xmath181 ,",
    "the difference is even more pronounced and reaches the value of @xmath190 , which in turn leads the tube embedded in the convective background to be stopped by the time it reaches the middle of the cz .",
    "the effects of intense downflows again appear to be very significant in these weak b cases and we thus show the dramatic changes that the introduction of a convective environment implies on the simulations of rising flux tube .",
    "it has to be noticed that the ratio between the rise velocity of a section of the tube located in an upflow and another located in a downflow is about 1.5 .",
    "thus for example in case cat45 where the average rise velocity is about @xmath188 , the region of the tube located in a particular upflow can reach a velocity of @xmath191 whereas a part located in a downflow will hardly reach @xmath192 .",
    "we note that these values are still lower than the rise velocity reached by a tube introduced in a stable isentropic layer , possibly showing the influence of the strong downflows over the whole tube which tries to keep its coherent structure during its rise .",
    "our study clearly shows the effects of a non - uniform rotation on magnetic ropes , especially the severe constraints on low - latitudes emergence it introduces .",
    "although the emergence through our upper boundary may have little resemblance with emergence at the real solar surface , this particular finding may still be interesting to consider when analysing the properties of the solar cycle which shows a strong decrease in the number of sunspots appearing at low latitudes in the declining phase .",
    "only sufficiently strong flux tubes would be able to rise at low latitudes , which is confirmed by some observations of sunspot magnetic field during a cycle .",
    "indeed , sunspots emerging at higher latitudes seem to possess brighter umbrae , thus indicating weaker magnetic fields @xcite , although this tendency seems to be slight and thus possibly due to an observational bias @xcite and has not been confirmed by other space - based studies @xcite .",
    "if we suppose that such effects happening deep inside the convection zone are visible during emergence at the surface , a possible explanation would thus be that differential rotation makes it more difficult for weak tubes to emerge at low latitudes and not only that they are drifting away from the radial trajectory as they rise , as they conclude in norton & gilman ( 2004 ) .",
    "panel 3 confirms the results in the isentropic case that showed that the poleward drift of the flux tubes due both to the uncompensated magnetic curvature force and to the coriolis force acting on the tube is more active at high latitudes .",
    "indeed , it is clear that at @xmath176 and @xmath177 , as soon as the tube has started rising , it is strongly deviated from the radial trajectory .",
    "we recover the particular behaviour of the tube introduced at @xmath177 which undergoes an equatorward drift because of the prograde flow being created in its interior .",
    "however , this deviation to the radial trajectory is less pronounced than in the isentropic cases , where for instance after 6 days of evolution , a tube initially located at @xmath176 had deviated by @xmath193 . in the same case here",
    ", the deviation angle hardly reaches @xmath194 at the same time , i.e. @xmath195 less .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the longitudinal flow appearing in the tube interior as soon as the tube begins to rise , which is much stronger in the isentropic cases than in the convective ones .",
    "this can be understood by considering the non - axisymmetric deformation of the tube in the convective case .",
    "this leads to friction between the magnetic structure and its surroundings which in turn transfers angular momentum to the mass elements in the tube and therefore leads to less retrograde motion .",
    "for instance , after 4 days of evolution , the tube embedded in the isentropic layer has created a longitudinal flow of about @xmath196 whereas the tube embedded in the convective zone has not developed any significant zonal motion , it is still rotating at the same velocity as its surroundings because the non - uniform rotation in radius plays a role in the conservation of the flux rope angular momentum . as a consequence ,",
    "the intensity of magnetic field needed for tubes to rise radially may be overestimated in the isentropic case .",
    "w now move to the study of the influence of the meridional flow , which may also act to advect the magnetic structure away from the radial trajectory .      as we said in the first section ,",
    "meridional flows are maintained by buoyancy forces , reynolds stresses , pressure gradients , maxwell stresses and coriolis forces acting on the differential rotation .",
    "since these relatively large forces nearly cancel one another , this circulation can be thought of as a small departure from ( magneto)geostrophic balance , and the presence of a localised magnetic field can clearly influence its subtle maintenance .    indeed , for two different initial magnetic intensity in the flux rope , it is interesting to focus on the streamfunction of the background meridional flow .",
    "figure [ figure_circmerid ] shows the position of the flux rope close to the end of its evolution through the cz , superimposed to the streamfunction of the meridional velocity .",
    "we clearly see that the situation is different in the two cases .",
    "in the strong b case , the contours of the mc streamfunction are concentrated around the flux rope and are very symmetric with respect to the tube apex . in this case , this observed velocity field is created by the flux rope itself through the back - reaction of the lorentz force on the flow and it is completely dominant compared to the background velocity .",
    "this velocity field structure , characterised by a strong upflow at the tube apex and two downdrafts at each side of the tube drives the tube radially upward , without any latitudinal drift since the magnetic structure is not sensitive to the background mc .",
    "the situation is clearly different in the weak b case . in this case , the velocity field created by the tube itself is of the same order as the background meridional flow and thus the rope is very likely to be advected in a particular direction whether it is embedded in a poleward or in an equatorward flow .",
    "here we note that by the time it reaches the top of the domain , the tube is drifting northward partly because of the poleward drift phenomenon we mentioned in the isentropic case .",
    "thus the tube ends up in a poleward flow at this particular longitude , which reinforces the poleward advection of the magnetic structure .",
    "several observational studies with mdi / soho data @xcite showed that emergence of new magnetic flux could generate perturbations on the observed surface horizontal flow .",
    "consequently , we can focus our study on the modification of this horizontal flow by the emergence of our flux tube modulated by convection .",
    "[ fig_ar_vitesse ] shows the superimposition of the emerging radial magnetic field and the horizontal velocity field close to the upper limit of the domain ( @xmath75 ) for case cat during the emergence process , and until the intensity of the emerging radial field has reached a value of about @xmath197 .",
    "on the first panel , the magnetic flux has hardly emerged ( the intensity of the radial field is below @xmath198 and the horizontal velocity field thus presents a pattern which is almost not modified by the magnetic tube .",
    "we then get the emergence of the magnetic structure , which is showed by the growing intensity of the radial field .",
    "as the structure emerges , the changes in the horizontal velocity field due to the magnetic forces are slight but visible",
    ". indeed , the intensity of the flow is growing because of the presence of magnetic field , which is especially clear on panels e ) and f ) around the positive polarity which is dominant for this particular bipolar patch .",
    "moreover , regions of converging flows become more confined between the actives longitudes , as we can see for example on panels d ) , e ) and f ) where the converging flow ( associated with a strong downflow lane around @xmath199 ) are particularly concentrated between the different emerging bipolar structures .",
    "another striking point is the acceleration of the retrograde zonal flow during emergence , as a result of the azimuthal velocity created within the tube because of angular momentum conservation .",
    "consequently , slight modifications can be seen on the structure of the horizontal flow as the magnetic structures emerge . to be more quantitative ,",
    "we focus on the creation of radial vorticity due both to hydrodynamical terms and to magnetic terms just before and after emergence and how the magnetic field plays a role in this balance to locally modify the flow structure . indeed , following the evolution of the radial vorticity",
    "enables to track the evolution of the horizontal flow profile since the radial vorticity can be expressed as follows :    @xmath200\\ ] ]    the evolution equation for @xmath201 can be decomposed on 4 hydrodynamical terms ( not depending on @xmath202 or any of its derivatives ) and 3 magnetic terms , as follows :    @xmath203_r}_{\\mbox{hydro terms}}\\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\underbrace{\\left [      \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\rho } c } \\left ( ( { \\bf b } \\cdot { \\bf \\nabla } ) { \\bf      j } - ( { \\bf j } \\cdot { \\bf \\nabla } ) { \\bf b } -{\\bf j } \\cdot { \\bf      \\nabla } ( \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\rho}})\\right ) \\right]_r}_{\\mbox{magnetic      terms } } \\label{eq_vort }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath204 the absolute vorticity defined by the relation @xmath205 .",
    "figure [ figure_radvort ] shows the value of the sum of only the hydrodynamical terms and of only the magnetic terms in the radial vorticity evolution equation [ eq_vort ] , just before emergence ( corresponding to panel a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_ar_vitesse ] ) and significantly after ( corresponding to panel f ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_ar_vitesse ] ) .",
    "we note that at the very beginning of emergence , when a small bipolar patch begins to emerge with the north - south orientation , the magnetic terms are more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the hydro terms .",
    "the latter completely determine the behaviour of the horizontal flow , especially the advection term ( second in the rhs of eq .",
    "[ eq_vort ] ) , which is dominant and peaks at about @xmath206 , whereas the dominant magnetic term hardly reaches @xmath207 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the structure has sufficiently emerged ( the structure and strength of the radial field at this time are showed on the last panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_ar_vitesse ] ) , the magnetic terms start to play a role in the vorticity generation and thus on the horizontal flow structure .",
    "they have increased by about 2 orders of magnitude and since the norm of the hydrodynamical terms stays close to the same values , all those terms begin to equally compete .",
    "we note that the magnetic source terms for radial vorticity concentrate everywhere the magnetic field gradients are sharp .",
    "this can be seen especially around the strong positive polarity around 55 degrees of longitude and 40 degrees of latitude . in this region ,",
    "the structure has emerged and thus a strong gradient in longitude of all components of the the field will act to produce currents which will in turn play a role in the radial vorticity generation . we thus conclude that the horizontal flow is modified by magnetic fields preferentially where strong gradients of field exist , for instance at the edge of the emerging structure , in agreement with what was concluded from the analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig_ar_vitesse ] .",
    "we now turn to investigate how the significant parameters of the reference case influence the flux tube in its rise through the convection zone in the case where we have a fully turbulent convection developed in the bulk of the computational domain .",
    "we will also look for new key parameters which may constrain the behaviour of the magnetic rope during its dynamical evolution .",
    "we saw that the twist of the field lines plays a fundamental role in the ability of the flux tube to rise cohesively in a stratified layer .",
    "moreover , observations of active regions show that a certain amount of twist of the field lines is often detected @xcite , especially in regions called sigmoids .",
    "these sigmoids take the shape of a reversed s in the northern hemisphere and of a s in the southern hemisphere , sign of the hemispheric law for helicity ( which is directly related to the twist ) which is found to be preferentially negative in the north and positive in the south .",
    "these regions are of particular interest because they are known to be favoured places for the triggering of cmes or other violent events at the solar surface .",
    "recent numerical simulations @xcite show that a twisted flux rope is always present at a certain point in the flux emergence ( prior to the emergence for trk & kliem and built during the emergence for amari et al . ) and that the twist is sometimes the determining factor for the eruption to occur ( via the kink - instability for example ) .",
    "consequently , both simulations and observations show the fundamental role of the twist of the field lines while flux emerges and a further investigation of this parameter is then particularly important .",
    "figure [ figure_split ] shows the behaviour of a flux tube embedded in a fully convective shell in an untwisted case ( lower panel ) and a twisted case ( upper panel ) .",
    "we recover the fact that a sufficient twist of the field lines is needed for the tube to maintain its integrity while it rises through the cz .",
    "indeed , we note that in the untwisted case , the tube splits into two parts while it rises because of the uncompensated vorticity generation created inside the flux rope by the gravitational torque , as was discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect_isen ] and in jouve & brun @xcite in the reference case . on the contrary , the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figure_split ] illustrates the fact that the twisted magnetic structure has kept its tube - like shape by the time it has almost reached the top of the shell .",
    "we also note that the deformation of the rope due to the convective up and down flows is more pronounced in the untwisted case . indeed , since the tube splits into two separate concentrations of flux , the two resulting structures are magnetically less strong and are thus more sensitive to the surrounding convective motions .",
    "moreover , when the tube is twisted , magnetic tension acts to prevent convective downdrafts from penetrating into the magnetic structure .",
    "the tube is thus more cohesive and thus less distorted than in the untwisted case ( even if the modulation in longitude is already very significant ) and is able to reach the top of the computational domain and emerge .",
    "figure [ figure_orient ] shows that the twist of the field lines is of major interest for the orientation of the emerging bipolar structures as we already saw in the preceding section . in the non - twisted case , when the tube is sufficiently strong to reach the top of the cz , the emerging radial field creates bipolar regions which have the right east - west orientation . however , these active regions have a very significant extension in latitude because of the two counter vortex rolls which drift apart horizontally and this is not what is observed in the sun where active regions are very localised in latitude . if the twist of the field lines just reaches the threshold , we see that the orientation of the patches becomes east - west quite early in the emerging process . indeed in this case ,",
    "we observe the radial field coming from the two feet of the arched ( because of convective down and up flows which deform the tube ) portion of the tube sooner than in the very twisted case where the radial field due to the twist dominates . as a consequence , if we follow the evolution of the tilt angle for this case as we did for case cat on fig .",
    "[ figure_shslflux ] , we see that it becomes east - west much more rapidly after emergence and above all that the final tilt angle we get is about @xmath208 , i.e. closer to the observations at this particular latitude .",
    "moreover , this case has an initial number of turns of 14 ( corresponding to a pitch angle of about @xmath209 ) and thus if we consider that the emerging region occupies about @xmath209 in longitude when it has expanded at the surface , the number of turns in this particular bipolar region would be of about 0.78 , in agreement with the typical value observed in most active regions .",
    "this case thus seems to be able to reproduce several interesting features of active regions such as their orientation ( even if the tilt angle is still high in comparison to observations but could be reduced with more arched structures ) , their amount of twist and the field strength inside the regions of opposite polarities , which is of the order of 1 kilogauss , as in case cat .",

    ". we vary @xmath21 from a value of @xmath212 in the middle of the convection zone ( corresponding to a magnetic prandtl number of unity ) to a value of @xmath213 ( leading to @xmath214 ) and to a value of @xmath215 ( leading to @xmath211 ) .",
    "it has been shown in previous thin flux - tube studies @xcite that a strong entropy gradient could be built between the tube interior and its surroundings during its rise through the cz . as a consequence of higher entropy within the tube",
    ", the external gas pressure decreases faster than the internal pressure and may finally reach the same value , forcing the magnetic pressure to approach zero .",
    "the tube apex then experiences a so - called explosion which causes this part of the tube to stop rising and leads to an amplification of the magnetic field in the non - exploded parts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a full mhd treatment of this process ) . in our simulations where the high diffusion of entropy may wash out the gradients responsible for such effects , our tubes do not undergo any explosion and stay magnetically buoyant from the base of the cz to the top of our computational domain .",
    "however , for this section , we wanted to keep the same convective background and at the same time keep the value of @xmath216 unchanged since it has proved to be favorable to a solar - like differential rotation ( brun & toomre 2002 ; miesch et al .",
    "this has dictated our choice of @xmath23 and @xmath24 and thus we did not consider those parameters as free anymore . at the present time , the ash code uses effective eddy diffusivities to represent momentum , heat and magnetic field transport by motions which are not resolved by the simulation .",
    "they are allowed to vary in radius but are independent of latitude , longitude and time .",
    "this type of treatment for the unresolved motions thus affects all spatial scales and it has to be stated that this may have a significant influence on the evolution of spatially localised structures such as the magnetic flux tubes introduced in our simulations and the strong subsequent currents created .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the diffusion term as a whole preferentially acts where the magnetic field gradients ( or equivalently the currents ) are the strongest .",
    "an improved treatment of sub - grid - scale motions in ash is currently being considered , which would take into account a spatial dependence of the transport coefficients .",
    "the influence of this new treatment on our results will have to be checked but for this work , we focus on the major differences which can already be pointed out between cases at various @xmath217 , thus showing the particular care with which diffusion has to be considered in this type of simulations .    after 5 days in the convection zone ,",
    "the tubes introduced with various magnetic diffusivities have evolved in a very different way , as shown on fig .",
    "[ figure_pm ] .",
    "we clearly see the difference in the expansion of the magnetic field concentration as the tube rises , each cut in the ( r,@xmath110 ) having the same dimensions .",
    "since the diffusive time goes from @xmath218 58 days for @xmath214 to 14.5 days when @xmath210 to 3.6 days when @xmath211 ( using the value of the magnetic diffusivity at the base of the convection zone ) , it is straightforward to note that the intensity of the magnetic field retained in the flux rope after the same time of evolution in the convection zone is strongly decreased ( by a factor 4.5 between @xmath214 and @xmath211 ) when the magnetic diffusivity is increased .",
    "moreover , we see that the two sharper and fainter structures at each side of the tube visible on the first panel are completely lost because of the action of diffusion in the two other cases . finally , the major consequence of increasing the magnetic diffusivity can be seen on the last panel of the figure , in the @xmath211 case . not only has the tube significantly expanded compared to the others but it seems to have split apart because of an insufficient amount of twist to maintain its coherence .",
    "we investigate the evolution of the twist of the field lines in the 3 different cases to understand how a high magnetic diffusivity has caused the tube to lose its coherence during its rise .",
    "figure [ figure_twpm ] shows the profile of the sine of the pitch angle and of the longitudinal and transverse magnetic field at the location of the flux tube at the starting time and after 5 hours of evolution for the various cases .",
    "we note that the magnetic structures in the @xmath210 and @xmath214 cases stiffen in comparison to the initial configuration , a feature which is mainly due to the creation of current sheets ahead of the flux tube when it begins its rise through the cz .",
    "the main results that we deduce from this analysis is that the transverse field gets a sharper structure than the longitudinal field as soon as the tube begins its rise .",
    "this property leads to a faster diffusion of transverse field than of longitudinal field .",
    "indeed , panel 2 shows that in the @xmath211 case , the maximum of @xmath158 is @xmath219 of the maximum for the @xmath214 case whereas the maximum of the transverse field only reaches @xmath220 of the maximal transverse field for the less diffusive case . as a consequence",
    ", the pitch angle is strongly reduced by this faster diffusion of transverse fields , the tension force is not sufficient anymore to counteract the vorticity generation inside the tube and thus the pitch angle quickly goes under the threshold value needed to maintain the tube coherence .",
    "we now turn to investigate the influence of the tube radius , which is closely linked to the study of variations of the magnetic diffusivity which we addressed in the preceding section . indeed ,",
    "since the diffusive time is proportional to the square of the tube radius , magnetic diffusion will act faster on smaller tubes and we must thus take into account its potential effects on our tubes . consequently , we choose to compute models with @xmath214 , which will limit the effects of diffusion , and we modify the tube radius from @xmath101 to @xmath221 and to @xmath222 .",
    "the initial magnetic field is chosen to be equal to @xmath126 and the sine of the pitch angle equal to 0.5 , as in our standard case cat . to compute these models ,",
    "a very high resolution is needed , in particular , in the smallest tube case ( @xmath222 ) , we use 1024 points in latitude , 2048 in longitude and 450 in radius , leading to a number of points to describe the tube section of 26 points in radius and 10 points in latitude . in the @xmath101 case with @xmath214 , we also increase the resolution in latitude compared to our previous cases ( 1024 points instead of 512 , although the results are qualitatively similar ) but keep 256 points in radius , we thus end up with @xmath223 points to resolve the tube section .",
    "finally , for the @xmath221 tube , the number of points in the tube is also @xmath223 ( as the total resolution in latitude is now 512 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the number of points is thus significant enough to have a good description of the magnetic field profile inside the rope .     in the northern hemisphere at a specific longitude for tubes with an initial radius of @xmath222 ( top panel ) , @xmath101 ( mid - panel ) and @xmath221 ( bottom panel ) after about 6.6 days of evolution in a convective model with @xmath214.,width=370 ]    figure [ figure_radius ] shows the result of the study of the influence of the tube radius on its evolution in the convection zone .",
    "we focus on the structure of the longitudinal field @xmath158 at two different longitudes and at a specific time , close to the end of the evolution ( after 6.6 days ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the concentration of magnetic flux in the tube interior is broader when the tube is larger and the amount of flux retained in the tube is smaller in the @xmath222-radius tube since the magnetic diffusion has started to play a significant role , even if choosing @xmath217 to be equal to 4 made the diffusive time to be about 14 days in the smallest tube case . as a consequence , we note on the first panel that the convection has acted to modulate the tube in longitude since the left structure has evolved very differently from the right one .",
    "this asymmetry is also visible on the second panel ( where the tube radius was originally @xmath101 ) but is less clear on the largest tube calculation , for which the competition with convective motions is in favour of the magnetic structure .",
    "the main differences in the evolution of these tubes with various radii reside in the wake that they create during their rise .",
    "we can focus on these differences by zooming on the section of the tube at a particular longitude , as shown on fig .",
    "[ figure_radius ] . in the smallest tube cases ,",
    "we clearly see two sharp structures being created at both sides of the magnetic rope and one central tail ( especially visible on the 2 last panels ) which enables to approximately follow the trajectory of the tube axis as it rose through the cz .",
    "these structures and their properties were studied in great detail in emonet & moreno - insertis ( 1998 ) and their analysis apply to what we obtain in our simulations .",
    "we can add to this study that a modification of the tube extension in radius leads to a different evolution of the wake and thus of the vorticity distribution inside the tube .",
    "indeed , the wake extends further behind the tube apex when the tube is smaller , the 2 sidelobes where the vorticity is concentrated are located significantly behind the apex whereas in the bigger radius case , the 2 sidelobes appear to stay very close to the main flux concentration , as was seen in previous calculations in cartesian geometry .",
    "one of the main goals of this work was to investigate what type of emerging structures we obtain in the upper part of the convection zone when we introduce an axisymmetric flux tube at its base .",
    "we saw that all the various flows existing in the convection zone could strongly influence the behaviour of the tube while it rises .",
    "if the tube is sufficiently weak to be sensitive to the presence of mean flows and turbulent convection close to the surface , we saw that an azimuthal modulation was created by convective motions .",
    "this modulation in longitude on the magnetic structure produces arched regions , the center of which will emerge before the `` sides '' ( or the `` feet '' ) . as a consequence , in the first phases of emergence , only a portion of the tube is visible at the surface and emerges as a bipolar region .",
    "the orientation of such a bipolar structure will first be north - south but as the emergence proceeds , different processes will act to produce the tilt angle corresponding to the statistical joy s law . as was pointed out before ,",
    "both the coriolis force acting differently on the two legs of the loop and the twist of the field lines are able to produce an angle compared to the east - west direction before and during emergence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we here showed an example of a flux tube possessing an amount of twist just above the threshold .",
    "this simulation can reproduce several characteristics of active regions , namely the amount of twist in the bipolar structure , the magnetic field strength in each polarity and the orientation of the two polarities .",
    "we moreover emphasise that convective motions advecting separately the two opposite polarities of the patch of magnetic field can also be a source of the tilting of active regions , which could not have been investigated in previous cartesian or non - convective studies . to disentangle between those various physical processes acting to produce the tilt angle necessary for some kind of dynamos to work such as babcock - leighton dynamos ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we now need to concentrate on an individual active region emerging at the solar surface and its particular morphological and dynamical properties .",
    "to do so , we plan to investigate the rise of non - uniformly buoyant flux tubes from the solar interior to the surface in a fully convective environment possessing mean flows , as in the present work .",
    "indeed , we showed in this study the particular effect of differential rotation on tubes introduced at different latitudes . as rotation has the property to slow tubes down during their rise and that rotation is stronger at lower latitudes",
    ", it would imply that tubes emerging at lower latitudes would have to be more intense to make their way up to the surface .",
    "the mean meridional flow proves to have smaller effects on the flux tube rise but may well modify the trajectory of structures slightly in superequipartition with the strongest downflows at the base of the convection zone .",
    "moreover , our simulations show that the magnetic terms can play a significant role in the horizontal flow maintenance close to the surface and thus that the appearance of magnetic patches at the top of our domain locally modifies the surface flow structure .",
    "mean flows should thus be taken into account in future simulations of rising magnetic structures , since their interactions with flux ropes are far from being negligible .",
    "we now need to consider the introduction of such flux tubes in a magnetised environment where different scales would interact and the dynamo field would probably modify the results of the present study . in particular , reconnection in the interior of our computational domain between our well - defined flux tube and a more turbulent chaotic small - scale field is likely to modify the amount of twist of the field lines contained in the rope . indeed , how twist is created in the solar interior and how it is modified during the rise of magnetic structures are still questions to be addressed .",
    "several observational studies of helicity in active regions @xcite tend to show that a systematic twist of the field lines can be observed but the intensity of which would be small compared to what is needed in simulations for tubes to rise coherently from the base of the cz to the surface . we thus need to reconcile the theoretical and observational approaches in studying the evolution of the twist of the field lines of a flux tube embedded in a realistic magnetised convection zone .",
    "we plan to do so in a future work .",
    "moreover , to allow some direct comparison to observations , the implementation of a stable layer in the ash code in which a full mhd treatment of the emergence will be applied is currently worked on .",
    "the results of this more realistic upper boundary and the emergence at the top of this new domain will be the topic of a following paper .",

    "<S> we present the first 3d mhd study in spherical geometry of the non - linear dynamical evolution of magnetic flux tubes in a turbulent rotating convection zone . </S>",
    "<S> these numerical simulations use the anelastic spherical harmonic ( ash ) code . </S>",
    "<S> we seek to understand the mechanism of emergence of strong toroidal fields through a turbulent layer from the base of the solar convection zone to the surface as active regions . </S>",
    "<S> to do so , we study numerically the rise of magnetic toroidal flux ropes from the base of a modelled convection zone up to the top of our computational domain where bipolar patches are formed . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the dynamical behaviour of flux tubes in a fully convective shell possessing self - consistently generated mean flows such as meridional circulation and differential rotation , with reference calculations done in a quiet isentropic zone .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that two parameters influence the tubes during their rise through the convection zone : the initial field strength and amount of twist , thus confirming previous findings in cartesian geometry . </S>",
    "<S> further , when the tube is sufficiently strong with respect to the equipartition field , it rises almost radially independently of the initial latitude ( either low or high ) . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , weaker field cases indicate that downflows and upflows control the rising velocity of particular regions of the rope and could in principle favour the emergence of flux through @xmath0-loop structures . for these latter cases , we focus on the orientation of bipolar patches and find that sufficiently arched structures are able to create bipolar regions with a predominantly east - west orientation . </S>",
    "<S> meridional flow seems to determine the trajectory of the magnetic rope when the field strength has been significantly reduced near the top of the domain . </S>",
    "<S> appearance of local magnetic field also feeds back on the horizontal flows thus perturbing the meridional circulation via maxwell stresses . </S>",
    "<S> finally differential rotation makes it more difficult for tubes introduced at low latitudes to reach the top of the domain . </S>"
