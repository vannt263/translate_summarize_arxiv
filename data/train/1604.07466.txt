    "we note that the term `` isotopy '' has several meanings in smooth topology : there is a standard term _ isotopy _ for two diffeomorphisms ( which is equivalent to the fact that these diffeomorphisms are in the same path - component of @xmath25 ) .",

    "we conjecture that this obstruction should provide many examples of concordant psc - metrics which are not psc - isotopic . on the other hand , we give an affirmative answer to the general question modulo of that topological obstruction : two psc - metrics are psc - concordant if and only if they are psc - isotopic up to pseudo - isotopy ( see theorem a ) .",
    "in particular , this implies that the answer to the general question is always positive for simply - connected manifolds of dimension at least five ( see theorem b ) .      to identify a potential topological obstruction , we recall a few definitions and results from smooth topology .",

    "in other words , an isotopy @xmath57 is just a smooth path of diffeomorphisms @xmath58 starting with the identity : @xmath59 .",
    "then two diffeomorphisms @xmath49 are said to be _ isotopic _ if there is an isotopy @xmath60 such that @xmath61 .",

    "the author is grateful to w. steimle for clarifying this issue .",
    "it is worth noting here that the obstruction group @xmath79 is often non - trivial ; for instance , the obstruction group is `` almost always '' non - zero if the fundamental group @xmath80 contains torsion ( see , say , @xcite for more details ) .",

    "there is another important aspect concerning the above general question .",

    "( sketch ) the proof of theorem [ thm : logic1 ] is based on a well - known fact , namely , that the problem of recognizing the trivial group out of given finite sets of generators and relations is algorithmically unsolvable .",
    "to get to a psc - concordance , we take finite `` unrecognizable '' sets of generators and relations ; this gives us finite @xmath88-complex @xmath18 , which has a unique zero cell , as many 1-cells as the number of generators , and with 2-cells attached according to the relations . by construction , @xmath89 .",
    "we embed @xmath18 into the euclidean space @xmath90 and denote by @xmath91 its closed tubular neighbourhood in @xmath90",

    "fig : exotic ] .",
    "it is indeed exotic since there is no algorithm which would turn that psc - concordance into psc - isotopy : otherwise , it would recognize along the way that the original system of generators and relations determines a trivial group .",
    "in particular , theorem [ thm : logic1 ] implies that in order to make any progress on whether a psc - concordance implies a psc - isotopy , we have to employ some tools which are `` non - algorithmic '' by their nature , such as surgery .      since in general , there are topological obstructions to finding a psc - isotopy for psc - concordant metrics , we would like to separate the _ geometric _ issues from the _ topological _ ones concerning the problem of whether psc - concordance implies psc - isotopy .",

    "the restriction @xmath1508 to the face @xmath1511 coincides with @xmath1512 ; 3 .",
    "the restriction @xmath1508 to the face @xmath1513 is surgery - ready , i.e. , it coincides with the metric @xmath1514 on the strip @xmath1515 4 .",
    "the metric @xmath1508 is a product - metric near all faces of @xmath1516 .",
    "in particular , we have that the metrics @xmath1517 and @xmath0 are psc - isotopic , as well as the metrics @xmath1518 and @xmath1519 are psc - isotopic . we use ( iii ) from proposition [ prop : surgery - corners ] and the procedure described in section [ subsec : surgery - psc - concordance ] to perform a gromov - lawson surgery on the sphere @xmath111 along the strip @xmath1520 to obtain psc - metrics @xmath1399 and @xmath1521 on the manifold @xmath110 together with psc - isotopy between the psc - metrics @xmath1399 and @xmath1522 .",
    "we note that the metric @xmath1399 is nothing but the original gromov - lawson metric on @xmath110 by construction .",

    "we conclude that if psc - metrics @xmath97 are psc - isotopic up to pseudo - isotopy on @xmath2 , then the psc - metrics @xmath1526 obtained from the metrics @xmath1527 by means of the gromov - lawson surgery , are psc - isotopic up to pseudoisotopy on @xmath110 .",
