    "the standard model predicts top quark production cross - section of 20  fb at 3 tev .",
    "accurate determination of the cross - section as well as the forward - backward asymmetry allows to test the sm .",
    "deviations from the sm predictions could give indirect evidence of @xmath4 bosons , or , the measurements could be used to exclude the bosons to masses much higher than the @xmath5 of the collider @xcite .    the main background to be considered is @xmath6 with gluon radiation .",
    "this process is important as the cross - section is almost two orders of magnitude larger than that of the signal process .",
    "the irreducible background from @xmath7 has cross - section of 2.6  fb .",
    "pythia 6.1 was used to generate processes @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ". the detector response was simulated by simdet 4.0 with clic settings , the beam spectrum was obtained using calypso , and hades was used for @xmath10 background , integrating over four bunch crossings .",
    "the @xmath0 events have three possible topologies , which require different treatment in the reconstruction .",
    "the top quarks are expected to decay @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath12 boson can decay either to leptons , @xmath13 , or to quarks , @xmath14 .",
    "the event is called hadronic ( 46  % ) , if both @xmath12 bosons decay to quarks , leptonic ( 10  % ) , if they both decay to leptons , and semileptonic ( 44  % ) , if one @xmath12 decays to hadrons and the other to leptons . only those top quarks with the @xmath12 boson decaying to hadrons",
    "can be accurately reconstructed .",
    "the main challenge in the reconstruction comes from jet clustering .",
    "it is assumed that a hadronically decaying @xmath15 produces three jets and a leptonically decaying @xmath15 one jet and an isolated lepton .",
    "therefore the number of jets in the event is forced to be either six ( hadronic case ) or four ( semileptonic case ) .",
    "however , the angles between the produced quarks are rather small , typically of the order of @xmath16  rad .",
    "also especially the @xmath17 jets can be very soft , with energies less than typical gluon jet energies .",
    "therefore , the @xmath17 jet may be merged with one of the jets from @xmath12 , or the @xmath12 jets merged together , with an additional gluon jet reconstructed .",
    "the event reconstruction was started with lepton tagging .",
    "the tagged leptons were required to have @xmath18  gev and no other tracks within 0.01  rad . the efficiency to tag a lepton",
    "was assumed to be @xmath19  % .",
    "jets were reconstructed using the jade algorithm , requiring six jets when there were no tagged leptons in event and four jets otherwise .",
    "jet @xmath17-tagging was then performed , assuming 85 % efficiency to identify a @xmath17 jet , 30 ( 10 ) % efficiency to mistag a @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) jet .",
    "only events with 1 , 2 or 3 @xmath17-tagged jets were considered further .",
    "it was assumed that each top consists of one @xmath17-tagged jet and between one and three non-@xmath17-tagged jets . among the non-@xmath17-tagged jets ,",
    "the combination that gave reconstructed mass closest to @xmath22 , was searched . when no leptons were tagged in the event ,",
    "the combinations of jets with two reconstructed tops that minimised @xmath23 was selected . in events with tagged leptons ,",
    "only one top was reconstructed and thus the combination with the smallest @xmath24 was chosen .    reduction of the background was performed based on jet energies , number of tracks in each jet and the distances between the jets .",
    "typically @xmath25 pair events have two very energetic jets and the rest of the jets are very soft , while in signal events all the jets tend to be in the mid - energy range . based on the distributions , for each event a probability was calculated for the event to be a signal event , @xmath25 pair event or @xmath26 event .",
    "also probabilities that the event is hadronic , leptonic or semileptonic signal event were obtained for use in the asymmetry measurement .",
    "for the cross - section measurement , events were required to have more than @xmath27  % probability to be a signal event if two or three of the jets were @xmath17-tagged , and more than @xmath28  % probability , if only one jet was @xmath17-tagged .",
    "only events where the reconstructed masses satisfied @xmath29  gev/@xmath30  gev/@xmath31 and @xmath32  gev/@xmath33  gev/@xmath31 were selected . the efficiency to select @xmath34 events and the fraction of these signal events in the selected sample after each selection",
    "are given in table  1 .",
    "[ tmas ] +    the obtained efficiency of @xmath35  % translates to @xmath36  % accuracy in the cross - section determination .",
    "the reconstruced top mass distribution is depicted in figure  1 .",
    "table 1 : signal event selection efficiency and purity for the cross - section measurement . +    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     after imposing these selection criteria , semileptonic @xmath37 decays were selected with @xmath38  % efficiency , and of the events in the sample @xmath39  % were signal events .",
    "largest background was @xmath25 pairs , @xmath40  % , followed by leptonic events , @xmath41  % .",
    "hadronic events were @xmath42  % and semileptonic events with wrong sign lepton were @xmath43  % .",
    "last contribution to the sample were @xmath44 events , 2  % .",
    "considering that the fully leptonic events can also be used for the asymmetry determination , the purity is @xmath45  % . with the @xmath38  % efficiency to select semileptonic @xmath37 events and @xmath46  % efficiency to select fully leptonic events , the value of asymmetry can be measured with @xmath47  % accuracy with 1 ab@xmath3 of data , assuming perfect background subtraction.the angular distributions with backgrounds are shown in figure  2 .",
    "a method for top reconstruction at clic was developed , and it was used to measure the total @xmath0 cross - section @xmath48 and the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath49 . for these measurements ,",
    "background reduction was performed by using a probabilistic variable based on the jet energies , the number of tracks in each jet and the distance between the jets . according to the analysis",
    "the accuracy of the total cross - section measurement will be of the order of @xmath50 0.014 and for the asymmetry @xmath51 0.042 for 1 ab@xmath3 of data . as the asymmetry measurement is only targeted for semileptonic @xmath37 decays ,",
    "the accuracy can be further improved by adding specific analysis for the fully leptonic channel and the fully hadronic channel .",
    "the charge in the fully hadronic channel could be obtained by selecting events with a semileptonic @xmath52 decay in at least one hemisphere , or by using methods similar to the one used in the measurement of the @xmath53 @xcite ."
