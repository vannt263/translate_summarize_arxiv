    "gravity is scale - free . in the absence of any externally - imposed length scale , such as might be set by initial conditions , it is therefore reasonable to assume that gravitational clustering of particles in the universe should evolve towards a scale - invariant form , at least on small scales where gravitational effects presumably dominate over initial conditions .",
    "observations offer support for such an idea , in that the observed two - point correlation function @xmath2 of galaxies is reasonably well represented by a power law over quite a large range of length scales , @xmath3 ( groth & peebles 1977 ; davis & peebles 1983 ) for , say , @xmath4 between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "higher - order correlation functions of galaxies also appear to satisfy a scale - invariant form , with @xmath7 as expected from the application of a general scaling ansatz ( groth & peebles 1977 ; fry & peebles 1978 ; davis & peebles 1983 ; szapudi et al .",
    "for example , the observed three point function , @xmath8 , is well - established to have a hierarchical form @xmath9 where @xmath10 , etc . in a similar spirit",
    ", the four - point correlation function can be expressed as a combination of four - point graphs with two different topologies  `` snake '' and `` star ''  with corresponding amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "@xmath13 ( fry & peebles 1978 , fry 1984a , bonometto et al .",
    "1990 , valdarini & borgani 1991 ) .",
    "it is natural on the basis of these considerations to infer that all n - point correlation functions can be expressed as a sum over all possible n - tree graphs with ( in general ) different amplitudes for each tree diagram .",
    "it is also generally assumed that there is no shape - dependence in these tree amplitudes in the highly non - linear regime : @xmath14 some numerical experiments have confirmed the validity of such an assumption , at least as far as three - point correlation function is concerned ( scoccimarro et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "this tree - level model of hierarchical clustering however is a particular case of a more general scaling ansatz proposed by balian & schaeffer ( 1988 , 1989 ) , in which the @xmath15point correlation functions can be written in the form @xmath16 rigorous theoretical motivation for these assumptions are , however , yet to be forthcoming .",
    "considerable progress has been made recently in understanding the evolution of gravitational clustering in limit of weak clustering , i.e. in the quasi - linear regime ( e.g. sahni & coles 1995 ) .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that , in the quasi - linear regime , a tree - level hierarchy of correlation functions develops which satisfies @xmath17 at the limit of vanishing variance . on the other hand ,",
    "the intermediate regime , where loop corrections to tree - level diagrams become important , and the highly non - linear regime , where perturbative calculations break down completely , remain poorly understood and answers to many questions are still unclear .",
    "theoretical studies of the evolution of correlation functions in the highly nonlinear regime have mainly concentrated on possible closure schemes for the born - bogoliubov - green - kirkwood - yvon ( bbgky ) equations ( davis & peebles 1977 ) , stability properties of these closure schemes ( ruamsuwan & fry 1992 ) and different phase - space separation schemes for hierarchical solutions of arbitrary order ( fry 1982 ; hamilton 1988 ) .",
    "although a general solution of the bbgky equations in nonlinear regime is still lacking , various interesting characteristics of the count probability distribution function ( cpdf ) and void probability distribution function ( vpf ) have been established by balian & schaeffer(1992 ) .",
    "these predictions have also been tested against numerical simulations , in both two and three dimensions , and were found to be in good agreement .",
    "however , most of the analytical results available so far relate to quantities associated only with one - point cumulants .",
    "examples are the so - called @xmath0 parameters , as well as the cpdf and vpf mentioned above .",
    "multi - point cumulant correlators ( mcc ) , which we shall introduce in this paper , are a natural generalization of the @xmath0 parameters and the two - point cumulant correlators ( 2cc ) which are generally used to analyze galaxy catalogs and compare observational data with different models of structure formation .",
    "cumulant correlators were proposed recently by szapudi & szalay ( 1997 ) and shown to be very efficient for extracting clustering information from galaxy surveys . in particular , they can be used to test gravitational instability scenario and constrain the initial power spectral index .",
    "analytical predictions regarding the 2ccs were made by bernardeau ( 1995 ) using tree - level perturbation theory in the limit of large separation .",
    "in particular , he showed how the _ bias _ of overdense cells with respect to the underlying mass distribution is related to the generating function of the 2ccs .",
    "these predictions were also successfully tested against numerical simulations .",
    "such calculations were also extended for application to projected ( angular ) catalogues and have now been shown to be in reasonable agreement with estimates of these quantities extracted from the apm survey ( munshi , melott & coles 1998 ) .",
    "bernardeau & schaeffer ( 1992 ) developed a systematic series expansion for the multi - point void probability distribution function ( mvpf ) which is essentially the generating function of the multi - point count probability distribution function ( mcpdf ) .",
    "this expansion again applies only in the highly nonlinear regime .",
    "using such a series expansion , based on powers of @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the variance in the @xmath20th cell , they were able to evaluate the bias associated with overdense regions .",
    "the bias thus calculated , which was analytically shown to depend only on a scaling variable associated with the collapsed object and an intrinsic property of the object , was later found to be in very good agreement with numerical calculations .",
    "it is clearly an interesting task to extend such analysis further and check predictions against numerical simulations .",
    "if one can believe that galaxies are in some way identified with overdensities in the matter distribution then observed estimates of the two - point cumulant correlators from a galaxy survey depend upon the bias of such regions relative to the underlying mass distribution .",
    "multipoint cumulant correlators allow more information to be deduced about the properties of bias , because the quantities related to the @xmath0 parameters of overdense cells .",
    "complete knowledge of all @xmath0 parameters ( which are related to the generating function of mccs to arbitrary order ) can also help us in constructing the count probability distribution , and related void probability distribution , for collapsed objects .",
    "unfortunately , there is at present no robust theoretical framework other than the hierarchical ansatz within which such objects can be studied .",
    "one - point statistics of collapsed objects have been studied by mo & white ( 1996 ) using the extended press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ; bond et al .",
    "1991 ; bower 1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ; kauffmann & white 1993 ) but it remains to be seen whether this formulation can be used to derive multi - point statistics for collapsed objects .",
    "the same is largely true of `` peaks theory '' which is based on an argument used by kaiser ( 1984 ) to explain the strong clustering of abell clusters using the properties of high - density regions in gaussian fields .",
    "this formalism was subsequently developed by bardeen et al.(1986 ) and its use in cosmology is now widespread .",
    "however , there is evidence that correspondence between dark haloes and density peaks is not particularly good ( frenk et al .",
    "1998 ; katz , quinn & gelb 1993 ) and one needs to take the gravitationally - induced motions of peaks into account to compute the final clustering properties of halos .",
    "progress has recently been made in overcoming these difficulties by bond & myers ( 1996a , b ) in the `` peak - patch formalism '' at the expense of considerable technical complexity .",
    "other efforts to study statistics of collapsed objects include use of the zeldovich approximation in nonlinear regime after suitably smoothing the initial potential and using the statistics of singularities of different types ( catelan et al .",
    "1998 ; lee & shandarin 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "it is also important to note that earlier derivation of bias and @xmath21 for collapsed objects in the context of hierarchical ansatz were done within the context of certain specific approximations and it is interesting to check their validity by extending such studies to higher orders , as they are widely used for error estimations of measurements from galaxy catalogs ( szapudi & colombi 1996 ) , as well as the derivation of mass function of collapsed objects ( valageas & schaeffer 1997 ) .    in a completely different context",
    "it was shown by colombi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that normalized one point cumulants or @xmath0 parameters for underlying mass distribution do not become constant in highly non - linear regime , in direct contrast to hierarchal ansatz . which is also connected to the question , if gravitational clustering at highly non - linear regime do satisfy the stable clustering ansatz ( peebles , 1980 ) .",
    "connection between stable clustering and hierarchical ansatz still remains unclear and it is also related to the question , if different initial conditions do lead to similar halo profiles . in a recent study , using stability analysis of nonlinear clustering yano & gouda ( 1998 ) showed that stable clustering may not be the most natural outcome of gravitational clustering and departure from stable clustering ansatz may mean departure from hierarchical ansatz .",
    "however their results depend on specific closure schemes . in any case",
    "such issues can only be tested if different prediction regarding hierarchical ansatz are derived analytically and tested against numerical simulations to find out their limitations , which is one of the motivation behind present study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we develop a diagrammatic method to represent cumulant correlators of arbitrary order . using these rules",
    "it is also possible to compute these quantities to arbitrary order . in section",
    "@xmath22 we use the method of bernardeau & schaeffer ( 1992 ) to compute generating functions of rccs to @xmath23 order . in section",
    "@xmath24 we use results of section @xmath22 to compute @xmath0 parameters for collapsed objects .",
    "we discuss these results in the last section , and place them in the context of other developments in this field .",
    "higher - order reduced correlation functions are typically dominated by contributions from high peaks of the density fields .",
    "it is reasonable , therefore , to infer that the generating functions of mccs are related in some way to the statistics of collapsed objects .",
    "according to the hierarchical ansatz , those tree - level diagrams which contribute to reduced correlation function of the form @xmath25 are of order @xmath26 .",
    "mccs can be constructed by identifying @xmath27 position arguments as @xmath28 , @xmath29 arguments as @xmath30 , and so on , with the @xmath28 representing the positions of `` cells '' defined by some implicit smoothing of the density field .",
    "not all contributions constructed in this way are of same order of magnitude .",
    "the dominant contribution will always come from those terms which have the minimum number of external lines joining different cells , since every extra line joining different cells contributes an extra factor of @xmath31 to the overall amplitude of the diagram .",
    "with such a construction , the complete tree diagram can be separated in two parts : ( i ) external lines joining different cells ; and ( ii ) internal lines joining the different vertices in the same cell in such a way as to keep the external tree topology unchanged .",
    "the number of internal degrees of freedom of the diagram corresponds to the number of different ways the internal vertices in a particular node can be arranged without altering the external connectivity of the tree .",
    "the external tree configuration connecting different nodes representing different cells on the other hand is very similar to the underlying tree structure of matter correlation function and depends only on the number of nodes in the tree . the number of different topologies for external tree increases with the number of nodes .",
    "the difference between the external tree structure connecting different nodes and the underlying tree structure of the matter correlations connecting different vertices is that nodes in the tree representation of mccs carry an internal degree of freedom due to the internal tree structure and represent an entire cell , whereas for the underlying matter distribution , each vertex represents a single point in space and does not carry any internal structure . if we denote by @xmath32 the number ways @xmath27 internal points can be arranged with one external leg remaining to be connected with another cell we can express the 2ccs as @xmath33 { \\bar \\xi}^{p + q -2 } = c_{pq } \\xi_{ab } { \\bar \\xi}^{p + q - 2}\\ ] ] similarly , we can define @xmath34 as an internal degree of freedom for a node with @xmath27 internal vertices and @xmath35 external legs .",
    "the 3ccs now can be expressed in terms @xmath34 and @xmath32 . in practice @xmath34",
    "can be described as number of different possible ways in which @xmath27 internal vertices can be rearranged keeping two external legs free : @xmath36 { \\bar \\xi}^{p + q + r -3 } = c_{pqr } \\xi_{abc } { \\bar \\xi}^{p + q + r - 3}\\ ] ] a similar decomposition of @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be used to define @xmath39 and @xmath40 : @xmath41{\\bar \\xi}^{p + q + r + s -4 } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & c_{pqrs } \\xi_{abcd } { \\bar \\xi}^{p + q + r + s - 4 } ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath42 { \\bar \\xi}^{p + q + r + s + t -5}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & c_{pqrst } \\xi_{abcde } { \\bar \\xi}^{p + q + r + s + t - 5 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is also possible to consider this set of new parameters @xmath43 describing the internal degrees of freedom as a set of reduced cumulant correlators ( rccs ) which can be used to decompose mccs @xmath44 . the number of subscript @xmath45s that appear in the rccs @xmath43 thus defined represents the number of external trees and @xmath27 represents the number of internal vertices . the total contribution from a cell is equal to product of all vertices in the internal tree structure and of the number of different ways one can rearrange the trees keeping the number of internal vertices and external legs fixed .",
    "the highest order vertex that appears in an internal tree of @xmath32 is @xmath27 , in @xmath34 it is @xmath46 and so on . for the purposes of counting different possible arrangements , the external hands are to be considered distinguishable , as they link different external nodes and hence represent one particular topology of the external tree .",
    "internal lines joining different vertices carry an weight of @xmath47 where , as above , @xmath19 is the variance in the @xmath20th cell .",
    "external lines carry an weight of @xmath48 , where @xmath48 represents the magnitude of the correlation function joining @xmath20th and @xmath49th cells .",
    "using these rules one can evaluate rccs to any order .",
    "we list here the contributions from different topologies at lower orders : @xmath50 the superscripts @xmath51 , @xmath52 , etc .",
    "denote different configurations of internal vertices with fixed external legs and the coefficients in each term represent the number number of possible internal rearrangements .",
    "we denote the amplitudes associated with @xmath53 order vertex of matter correlation function by @xmath54 .",
    "the sum of all internal vertices appearing in the tree - representation of mccs @xmath55 will satisfy the following equation , which guarantees that only the leading - order diagrams with the minimum numbers of external legs are considered : @xmath56 this means that , for one point cumulants , @xmath57 and for 2ccs @xmath58 .",
    "these are the same as the conditions met by the leading - order tree - level contributions of cumulants and cumulant correlators ( bernardeau 1995 ) .",
    "this can also be understood by noticing , for example , that the expression for the 3cc contains factors @xmath59 for three individual cells and two correlation functions connecting three different cells",
    "i.e. @xmath60 ( or any cyclic permutation ) , so finally we get the order to be equal to @xmath61 .",

    "this property of factorization is related to the fact that the bias associated with an overdense object is an intrinsic property of the object .",
    "the bias associated with a pair comprising two different objects can be factorised into two separate quantities which each represent the intrinsic bias of one constituent . in recent work munshi & melott ( 1998 )",

    "it is remarkable and encouraging that the hierarchical ansatz , which is known to be valid only in the highly non - linear regime , predicts the same results as this alternative formalism , which is based on smoothing of the initial density field .",
    "our starting point for this study has been the most general form of hierarchical model for the matter correlation functions in the highly non - linear regime .",
    "this is equivalent to the assumption that the correlation hierarchy can be built up as a tree structure where each vertex is assigned a different weight ( the vertex amplitude ) , but which is independent of geometrical form factors .",

    "we have adopted the method of generating functions introduced by bernardeau & schaeffer ( 1992 ) to show that such a hierarchy induces a similar tree structure for overdense cells , which we take to represent _ collapsed objects_.    we then expanded the generating functions for the joint probability distributions of several cells in terms of a series in powers of @xmath91 . at zeroth order",

    "similarly , each higher - order term reproduces the amplitude of a new vertex and the associated multipoint cumulant correlators ( mccs ) for collapsed objects .",
    "our analysis is also able to reproduce the exact number of all the higher - order hybrid and snake diagrams with their associated tree amplitudes .",
    "we found that the one - point and the multi - point statistics of collapsed objects depend physically on properties intrinsic to the objects , and thus depend mathematically only on the scaling variable @xmath195 .    assuming a very general model for the generating function @xmath79 , for the underlying mass we have computed cumulants @xmath145 and cumulant correlators @xmath196 for overdense cells .",
    "we have carried out this analysis in two limiting cases , of moderately overdense cells @xmath154 and extremely overdense cells @xmath197 , respectively .",
    "we find that for extremely overdense cells the results are independent of initial conditions , the amplitudes associated with vertices of arbitrary order tend asymptotically to unity , and the generating functions can be expressed in a closed form @xmath198 .",
    "this closed - form solution can be used to compute all other statistical quantities for over - dense cells such as the count probability distribution function ( cpdf ) or the void probability function ( vpf ) for overdense cells . for",
    "moderately overdense cells , the results depend on the initial power spectrum and we find that the @xmath0 parameters for overdense cells decrease with increasing small - scale power in this case .    we have also developed a diagrammatic method for counting different ways in which a general correlation function @xmath199 with @xmath15 arguments can be grouped in such a way that @xmath27 of its nodes are associated with one particular cell , @xmath29 are in a second cell , and so on . in leading order",
    "such a grouping of vertices in different cells generates a new level of the tree hierarchy which can be related to the correlation hierarchy for overdense cells .",
    "the only difference between the trees for the underlying mass distribution and those for collapsed objects lies in the internal structure of their constituent nodes .",
    "trees associated with collapsed objects have internal degrees of freedom for different vertices that appear in different ways . as we have shown , however , it is possible to group nodes associated with underlying mass trees in such a way as to replicate the tree structure for collapsed objects with same external topology but different internal weights .",
    "our method of counting internal degrees of freedom associated with the vertices matches with analytical results obtained by more laborious means .    in an exactly similar manner it is possible to use the trees associated with collapsed objects to study",
    "how clusters or groups of collapsed objects are correlated with each other . in this case",
    ", the nodes associated with groups of collapsed objects will have many more internal degrees of freedom as they will consist of nodes of tree structures of collapsed objects which themselves are made of point - like vertices of the underlying mass distribution .",
    "amplitudes associated with nodes appearing in the tree structure of groups of collapsed objects will definitely depend on the mass of objects that constitute the group , and will have scaling properties associated with them .",
    "we shall present a complete analysis of this problem in near future .",
    "> from an observational point of view , the results contained in this paper are important for estimating finite volume corrections .",
    "it is well known that the finite size of galaxy catalogs introduce errors in estimations of cumulants and cumulant correlators .",
    "error estimation for values of the @xmath0 parameters  normalised moments of the cpdf  extracted from finite catalogs involve volume integrals of the two - point joint probability distribution function .",
    "such an analysis , carried out by szapudi & colombi ( 1996 ) , involves the generating function @xmath200 . similar estimation procedures for",
    "multi - point cumulant correlators will involve higher - order generating functions describing correlation between more than two cells .",
    "our analytical expressions for @xmath201 will be useful in such analyses .",
    "in a slightly different approach , it is also possible to talk about the probability distribution in the context of error estimation . estimated values of different statistical quantities are affected by the presence or absence of rare objects in a finite size catalog .",
    "the higher the order of cumulant , the higher the contribution from the high-@xmath15 tail of the cpdf , which is highly sensitive to presence or absence of rare objects .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to expect that our analytical results determining the generating function for rare objects can be related to the probability distribution of estimated errors .",
    "this will extend earlier studies in this direction where only the variance of errors were considered .",
    "this is important because we know that finite volume correction not only introduces large error but measurements are more likely to underestimate the true values of cumulants or cumulant correlators .",
    "cumulants for collapsed objects have also been computed using alternative procedures , chiefly by extension of the press - schechter formalism ( bond et al .",
    "1991 ; bower 1992 ) .",
    "our results complement these studies , because they are based on a fully nonlinear approach and depend only on the assumption that there is a hierarchical structure of the correlation functions . we think this _ ansatz _ is based in relatively firm ground , and can , at least in principle , be directly related to the microscopic physics of gravitational clustering through the bbgky equations . the analysis can also be applied the mccs of arbitrary order which have not yet been investigated using any other formalism .",
    "our results for computation of @xmath0 parameters for collapsed objects match with such an analysis done using extended press - schechter formalism .",
    "however similar comparison for moderately over - dense objects are difficult as different prescriptions are used to define collapsed objects in these two formalisms .",
    "we plan to compare our theoretical predictions against numerical simulations both in 3d as well as in 2d , and will present these results in due course .",
    "it is also important to note that , owing to our incomplete knowledge of gravitational clustering in the highly non - linear regime , at least two different _ ansatze _ are often used to study nonlinear clustering , namely the hierarchical ansatz ( which we discuss here ) and the stable clustering _",
    "ansatz _ and these should not be confused . while the hierarchical _ ansatz _ relates higher - order correlation functions with the two - point correlation function , the stable clustering _",
    "ansatz _ on the other hand relates the power - law index of the two - point correlation with the initial power spectral index .",
    "thus these two _ ansatze _ are not contradictory but complement each other .",
    "our analysis is based completely on the hierarchical _ ansatz _ , and we have never used stable clustering to derive our results .    it may also be possible to extend our analysis to the joint probability distribution function of densities of concentric cells , with their centres coinciding with the centre of a dark halo .",
    "in such a context it will be interesting to check if our analysis can also predict the inner structure of haloes , i.e. their density profiles .",
    "this will also clarify the issue of whether there exists a universal halo profile as proposed by navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) and how it relates to stable clustering and to the hierarchical ansatz .",
    "we will report these results elsewhere .",
