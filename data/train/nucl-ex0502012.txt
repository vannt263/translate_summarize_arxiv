    "symmetries play an important and crucial role in physics .",
    "global symmetries give rise to conservation laws and local symmetries yield forces @xcite . to date we know four fundamental interactions : ( i ) electromagnetism , ( ii ) weak interactions , ( iii ) strong interactions , and ( iv ) gravitation .",
    "these four forces are fundamental in the sense that all observed dynamical processes in physics can be traced back to one or a combination of them .",
    "together with fundamental symmetries they from a framework on which all physical descriptions ultimately rest .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) is a remarkable theory which allows that electromagnetic , weak and many aspects of strong interactions can be described to astounding precision in one single coherent picture .",
    "it is a major goal in modern physics to find a unified quantum field theory which includes all the four known fundamental forces in physics . on this way , a satisfactory quantum description of gravity remains yet to be found and is a lively field of actual activity .    in this article",
    "we are concerned with important implications of the sm and centrally with searches for new , yet unobserved interactions . such are suggested by a variety of speculative models in which extensions to the present standard theory are introduced in order to explain some of the not well understood and not well founded features in the sm . among the intriguing questions in modern physics",
    "are the hierarchy of the fundamental fermion masses and the number of fundamental particle generations .",
    "further , the electro - weak sm has a rather large number of some 27 free parameters .",
    "all of them need to be extracted from experiments .",
    "it is rather unsatisfactory that the physical origin of the observed breaking of discrete symmetries in weak interactions , e.g. of parity ( p ) , of time reversal ( t ) and of combined charge conjugation and parity ( cp ) , remains unrevealed , although the experimental findings can be well described within the sm .",
    "the speculative models beyond the present standard theory include such which involve left - right symmetry , fundamental fermion compositeness , new particles , leptoquarks , supersymmetry , supergravity and many more .",
    "interesting candidates for an all encompassing quantum field theory are string or membrane ( m ) theories which in their low energy limit may include supersymmetry .    in the field of fundamental interactions",
    "there are two important lines of activities : firstly , there are searches for physics beyond the sm in order to base the description of all physical processes on a conceptually more satisfying foundation , and , secondly , the application of solid knowledge in the sm for extracting fundamental quantities and achieving a description of more complex physical systems , such as atomic nuclei .",
    "both these central goals can be achieved at upgraded present and novel , yet to be built facilities . in this connection",
    "a high intensity proton driver would serve to allow novel and more precise measurements in a large number of actual and urgent issues in this field @xcite .    here",
    "we can only address a few aspects of a rich spectrum of possibilities .",
    "the standard model has three generations of fundamental fermions which fall into two groups , leptons and quarks .",
    "the latter are the building blocks of hadrons and in particular of baryons , e.g. protons and neutrons , which consist of three quarks each .",
    "forces are mediated by bosons : the photon , the w@xmath1- and z@xmath2-bosons , and eight gluons .",
    "the leptons do not take part in strong interactions . in the sm",
    "there are three charged leptons ( e@xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and three electrically neutral neutrinos ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) ) as well as their respective antiparticles . for the neutrinos eigenstates of mass ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) and flavour are different and connected through a mixing matrix analogous to the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing in the quark sector ( see [ ckm ] ) .",
    "the reported evidence for neutrino oscillations strongly indicate finite @xmath12 masses . among the recent discoveries are the surprisingly large mixing angles @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) . the mixing angle @xmath15 , the phases for cp - violation , the question whether @xmath12 s are dirac or majorana particles and a direct measurement of a neutrino mass rank among the top issues in neutrino physics .",
    "the recent developments in the field of neutrino oscillation research and evidence for such from solar , reactor , atmospheric and accelerator neutrino experiments are reviewed in @xcite and @xcite in this volume .",
    "[ antenna ]      two new and unconventional neutrino detector ideas have come up and gained support in the recent couple of years , which have a potential to contribute significantly towards solving major puzzling questions in physics .    *",
    "the first concept employs the detection of high energetic charged particles originating from neutrino reactions through cherenkov radiation in the microwave region ( or even sound waves ) , which results , if such particles interact with , e.g . , the antarctic ice or the salt in large salt domes as they can be found also in the middle of europe @xcite .",
    "one advantage of such a detector is its larger density as compared to water , the typical detector material used up to date .",
    "it remains to be verified whether this concept will also be applicable for high energetic accelerator neutrinos , if timing information and narrowband radio detection techniques will be employed .",
    "* the second concept allows directional sensitivity for low energy anti - neutrinos . the reaction @xmath16 has a 1.8 ev threshold .",
    "the resulting neutron ( n ) carries directional information in its angular distribution after the event . in typical organic material",
    "the neutron has a range r@xmath17 of a few cm . with a detector consisting of tubes with a diameter of order r@xmath17 and with , e.g. ,",
    "boronated walls the resulting @xmath18-particle from the n+b nuclear reaction can be used to determine on average the direction of incoming anti - neutrinos .",
    "such a detector ( fig .",
    "[ antenna ] ) , if scaled to sufficient mass , can be used to determine the distribution of radionuclides in the interior of the earth ( including testing rather exotic ideas like the existence of a nuclear reactor in the earth s core ) .",
    "a further rather promising application would be a measurement of the neutrino generation mixing angle @xmath15 in a reactor experiment with a near and far detector in @xmath19 few 100  m and @xmath19 few 100 km distance . for this measurement",
    "the importance of directional sensitivity for low energy @xmath12 s is an indispensable requirement .",
    "the best neutrino mass limits result from measurements of the tritium @xmath0-decay spectrum close to its endpoint . since neutrinos are very light particles , a mass measurement can best be performed in this region of the spectrum as in other parts the nonlinear dependencies caused by the relativistic nature of the kinematic problem cause a significant loss of accuracy which overwhelms the gain in statistics one could hope for .",
    "two groups in troitzk and mainz used spectrometers based on magnetic adiabatic collimation combined with an electrostatic filter ( mac - e technique ) and found @xmath20 @xcite .    a new experiment , katrin @xcite , is presently prepared in karlsruhe , germany , which is planned to exploit the same technique ( fig . [ katrin ] ) .",
    "it aims for an improvement by about one order of magnitude .",
    "the physical dimensions of a mac - e device scale inversely with the possible sensitivity to a finite neutrino mass .",
    "this may ultimately limit an approach with this principle .    the katrin experiment will be sensitive to the mass range where a finite effective neutrino mass value of between 0.1 and 0.9 ev was extracted from a signal in neutrinoless double @xmath0-decay in @xmath21ge @xcite .",
    "the heidelberg - moskow collaboration performing the ge experiment in the grand sasso laboratory in italy reports a 4.2 standard deviation effect for the existence of this decay @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that neutrinoless double @xmath0-decay is only possible for majorana neutrinos .",
    "therefore a confirmed signal would solve one of the most urgent questions in particle physics .",
    "the mass and weak eigenstates of the six quarks ( u , d , s , c , b , t ) are different and related to each other by a @xmath22 unitary matrix , the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix ( table [ ckmmatrix ] ) .",
    "non - unitarity of this matrix would be an indication of physics beyond the sm and could be caused by a variety of possibilities , including the existence of more than three quark generations or yet undiscovered muon decay channels .",
    "the unitarity of the ckm matrix is therefore a severe check on the validity of the standard theory and sets bounds on speculative extensions to it .    the best test of unitarity results from the first row of the ckm matrix through @xmath23    .__ckm quark - mixing matrix resulting from recent experiments an their evaluation . _ _ [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ proton_driver ]    themselves in deviations from the newtonian laws of gravity at small distances .",
    "therefore an number of searches for such large extra dimensions has been started . at the institute laue langevain in grenoble , france , a new limit in parameter space ( fig .",
    "[ grav ] ) has been established for extra forces of the type @xmath24 where @xmath18 determines the strength and @xmath25 is the yukawa range of the additional interaction .",
    "the experiment uses quantum mechanical interference patterns from ultra - cold neutrons which may be viewed as gravitational matter `` standing '' waves @xcite .",
    "progress in the field of low energy experiments to verify and test the sm and to search for extensions to it would benefit in many cases significantly from new instrumentation and a new generation of particle sources . in particular , a high power proton driver would boost a large number of possible experiments which all have a high and robust discovery potential @xcite . in table",
    "[ proton_driver ] two possible scenarios for a 1  gev and a 30  gev machine are compared .",
    "the availability of such a machine would be desirable for a number of other fields as well , such as neutron scattering , in particular ultra - cold neutron research , or a new isol facility ( e.g. eurisol ) for nuclear physics with nuclei far off the valley of stability .",
    "a joint effort of several communities could benefit from synergy effects .",
    "possibilities for such a machine could arise at cern @xcite , femilab , j - parc and gsi with either a high power linac or a true rapid cycling synchrotron .",
    "nuclear physics and nuclear techniques offer a variety of possibilities to investigate fundamental symmetries in physics and to search for physics beyond the sm .",
    "experiments at nuclear physics facilities at low and intermediate energies offer in this respect a variety of possibilities which are complementary to approaches in high energy physics and in some cases exceed those significantly in their potential to steer physical model building .",
    "the advantage of high particle fluxes at a multi - megawatt facility allow higher sensitivity to rare processes because of higher statistics and because also in part novel experimental approaches are enabled by the combination of particle number and an appropriate time structure of the beam .",
    "the field is looking forward to a rich future .",
    "the author would like to the members of the nupecc long range plan 2004 fundamental interaction working group @xcite for numerous fruitful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the dutch stichting voor fundamenteel onderzoek der materie ( fom ) in the framework of the tri@xmath26p programme .",
