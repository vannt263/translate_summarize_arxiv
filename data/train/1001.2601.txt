    "magnetic orderings induced by impurity doping and by pressure in spin gap systems are still attracting much interest . and besides , it has been revealed that muons are the excellent probe to detect magnetic properties of randomness - introduced spin gap systems  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to investigate the microscopic properties of the pressure - induced phase in the impurity - doped spin gap system by the zero - field muon - spin - rotation / relaxation ( zf-@xmath0sr ) .",
    "single crystals used in this study were grown from a melt by the bridgman method .",

    "the observed transition temperature in pressure is consistent with the reported temperature in the case of @xmath8 0.012 deduced from the magnetization measurement@xcite . in order to discuss the development of the internal static magnetic field at the muon sites which corresponds to the ordered cu-3_d _",
    "magnetic moment , all spectra are analyzed using the two components function as follows : @xmath20 the first term is the signal from the magnetically ordered region of samples , and the second term is that from the large pressure cell and the spin fluctuating region of samples , because it is quite difficult to distinguish the relaxing part @xmath21 between the pressure cell and the samples . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the muon - spin - relaxation rate of each component , and @xmath24 is the muon - spin - rotation frequency .",
    "@xmath25 is the static kubo - toyabe function , where @xmath26 is the distribution width of nuclear - dipole fields at the muon sites .",
    "@xmath27 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon spin ( @xmath28 @xmath29 ) .",
    "the ratio of the amplitude @xmath30 is approximately 0.16 above 4 k. fitted results are shown in fig.1 as solid lines . from the fitted result , the internal static magnetic field @xmath31 at the muon sites is deduced using the relation of @xmath32 because implanted muon spins precess around the total magnetic field of the internal field and the external field at the muon sites .",

    "figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of zf-@xmath0sr time spectra in hydrostatic pressure of 4.0 kbar .",
    "spectra are analyzed in the same way with in the case for 3.1 kbar , but the ratio of the amplitude @xmath30 at 3.5 k is 0.04 in the case of 4.0 kbar .",
    "the small amplitude of the rotational signal is partially due to a slight discrepancy in the momentum tuning for implanting muons in samples and is partially due to the decrease of the volume fraction of the coherently ordered region at lower temperatures as discussed below .",
    "fitted results are shown as solid lines . deduced internal static magnetic field @xmath34 at the muon sites are summarized in fig.3 . with decreasing temperature in 3.1 kbar , @xmath31 increases monotonously , and tends to saturate to 280 oe around 4 k. however , @xmath31 decreases to 240 oe at 2.3 k. similar decrease of @xmath31 below 4 k is observed in 4.0 kbar .",
    "+ the decrease of @xmath31 suggests an orientation of the ordered moments , because the change of the magnetic structure leads to the modification of dipole fields at the muon sites .",
    "as mentioned above , in the pure tlcucl@xmath3 , the spin reorientation phase transition occurs at _ t_@xmath10 9.2 k in the high pressure of 14 kbar . in the pure sample ,",
    "the spin gap is collapsed by pressure in @xmath35 0.42 kbar  @xcite .",
    "for the mg - doped case , a finite spin gap still remains although the magnetic phase transition occurs  @xcite , and it is expected that the pressure effect is more significant in the case for mg - doped system , because the spin gap has already partially collapsed in space by the mg - doping .",
    "in other word , the pressure - induce new phase could be appeared in lower pressures compared to the case in the pure system .",
    "thus , we speculate that the spin reorientation phase transition occurs and that the oblique antiferromagnetic phase , which is observed in the pressure of 14 kbar on the pure tlcucl@xmath3  @xcite , appears in the mg - doped system .",
    "+ in the last , we discuss the decrease of the rotational amplitude in time spectra below 4 k. generally , the amplitude of the rotational signal corresponds to the volume fraction of the coherent long - range ordered region . for that reason , the decrease of the rotational amplitude suggests that , after the spin reorientation phase transition , the spin system become less coherent due to some randomness caused by the spin reorientation . in other word",
    ", some randomness caused by the spin reorientation would disturb the coherency of the ordered state .",
    "zero - field muon - spin - rotation ( zf-@xmath0sr ) measurements in hydrostatic pressures were carried out in impurity - doped quantum spin gap system tl(cu@xmath6mg@xmath7)cl@xmath3 with @xmath8 0.015 .",
    "the spontaneous muon spin precession , which indicates the existence of a long - range coherent order , is observed under pressures . with decreasing temperature in 3.1 kbar",
    ", the internal static magnetic field at the muon sites @xmath31 tends to saturate to 280 oe around 4 k , however , decreases to 240 oe at 2.3 k. similar decrease of @xmath31 below 4 k is observed in 4.0 kbar .",
    "these results suggest a rearrangement of ordered spins which leads to the change of @xmath31 .",
    "we speculate that the oblique antiferromagnetic phase , which is observed in the pressure of 14 kbar on the pure tlcucl@xmath3 , appears in the mg - doped system .",
    "we would like to thank c. m. goodway and all other members of high - pressure group of isis facility at the rutherford appleton laboratory for the technical support on @xmath0sr measurements in pressures .",
