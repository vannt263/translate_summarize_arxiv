    "the following nonlinear autonomous delay differential equation was proposed by mackey and glass @xcite to study the regulation of hematopoiesis : @xmath0 here @xmath1 are positive constants , @xmath2 is the concentration of cells in the circulating blood and the flux function @xmath3 of cells into the blood stream depends on the cell concentration at an earlier time .",
    "the delay @xmath4 describes the time between the start of cellular production in the bone marrow and the release of mature cells into the blood .",
    "it is assumed that the cells are lost at a rate proportional to their concentration , namely @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the decay rate .",
    "this equation is a model of ` dynamic disease ' .",
    "this type of population dynamics equations attracted the interest of many researchers .",
    "different aspects and properties of ( [ mg ] ) have been studied by various authors , see for example @xcite .",
    "most often , the environment is not temporally constant ; thus , it is intuitive to assume that this fact influences many biological dynamical systems and suggests the need of considering time - dependent parameters .",
    "moreover , as remarked in @xcite , more realistic models are those in which periodicity of the environment and time delay play a role ( for more details , see e.g. @xcite ) . in view of this",
    ", the following model is proposed in @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are positive integers , @xmath9 are positive @xmath10periodic functions and the delay @xmath11 is a multiple of the period determined by the environment .    in order to establish a more realistic model , it is convenient to introduce a more general delay that extends the two above - referred cases . instead of assuming that the delay is constant or a multiple of the period of the environment , more general models are obtained by assuming that the time delay @xmath4 is an arbitrary continuous nonnegative @xmath10periodic function depending on @xmath12 .",
    "the more general equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath4 are continuous positive @xmath10periodic functions was studied for example in @xcite .",
    "different aspects of equation ( [ mgcont ] ) have been considered ; in particular , existence of positive @xmath15-periodic solutions was proven , in most cases , using appropriate fixed point theorems . in @xcite ,",
    "coincidence degree theory was employed to prove the existence of a positive @xmath10periodic solution under a condition that can be regarded as a particular application of theorem [ sub ] , case @xmath16 below . moreover , when @xmath17 for some @xmath18 and when @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constant , the conditions @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively are both necessary and sufficient for the existence of positive @xmath15-periodic solutions .",
    "the following more general model was studied in @xcite and @xcite :    @xmath23    here , @xmath6 is a positive constant and @xmath24 are positive @xmath10periodic continuous functions . for @xmath25 , existence and uniqueness of positive @xmath15-periodic solutions",
    "was studied in @xcite for the particular case of constant proportional delays @xmath26 ; moreover , for general continuous , positive @xmath10periodic @xmath27 , attractiveness of some specific positive periodic solutions was studied . for the case @xmath28 and @xmath27 continuous positive and @xmath10periodic , existence and uniqueness of positive @xmath10periodic solutions of ( [ bb ] ) was proven in @xcite by fixed point methods , provided that one of the following conditions is satisfied :    @xmath29    motivated by the preceding discussion , we consider the following more general nonlinear nonautonomous model with several delays @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are positive and @xmath15-periodic functions and @xmath33 are positive constants .    existence of solutions of under appropriate conditions follows from several abstract results , although multiplicity results are more scarce . for example , in @xcite and @xcite krasnoselskii type fixed point theorem in cones were employed in order to obtain conditions for the existence of at least two @xmath10periodic solutions of the general equation @xmath34 it is observed , however , that these results can be applied only to few particular sub - cases of ( [ bbg ] ) . in such cases ,",
    "the conclusions are comparable to our results below .",
    "moreover , the existence of three nonnegative periodic solutions of ( [ yfw ] ) was studied by using leggett - williams fixed point theorem in @xcite . however , the conditions obtained in @xcite , as pointed out by the authors , are very difficult to apply to ( [ bbg ] ) with @xmath35 .",
    "thus , they established a complementary result with more straightforward conditions that can be applied to this model . unfortunately , in @xcite , the authors observed that this latter result was incorrect .    in section (",
    "* applications ) , the hematopoiesis model ( [ bbg ] ) for @xmath36 was studied , and the conditions obtained by the authors are similar to the ones proposed in theorem @xmath37 @xmath38 below .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in the referred result of @xcite , only two of the three @xmath15-periodic solutions are positive and the third one is positive if @xmath39 is not identically zero .",
    "this assumption is very restrictive and clearly is not fulfilled in ( [ bbg ] ) .",
    "moreover , all the mentioned works do not contemplate the _ superlinear _ case of ( [ bbg ] ) ( that is , @xmath40 for some @xmath41 ) .",
    "finally , we may mention the results in @xcite , in which the existence of at least @xmath42 solutions of ( [ yfw ] ) is proven , although the conditions are not applicable to our model .",
    "our goal in this paper is to establish sufficient criteria to guarantee , on the one hand , the existence of positive @xmath15-periodic solutions of ( [ bbg ] ) and , on the other hand , multiplicity of such solutions .",
    "using degree theory , we shall obtain a set of natural and easy - to - verify conditions for the existence of one or more solutions .",
    "the following notation will be used throughout the paper .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the space of continuous @xmath10periodic functions and define , for @xmath44 , @xmath45 the closure of @xmath46 shall be denoted by @xmath47 .",

    ".    then ( [ bbg1 ] ) has at least one solution in @xmath63 .    roughly speaking , if @xmath64 has different signs at both ends of some interval @xmath65\\subset\\mathbb{r}$ ]",
    "then the continuation theorem guarantees the existence of a @xmath15-periodic solution @xmath66 of ( [ bbg1 ] ) such that @xmath67 for all @xmath12 .",
    "however , the first condition of theorem [ cont ] requires , in some sense , that the sign of @xmath64 does not change too fast .",
    "the main part of our analysis shall be based on a study of the behavior of @xmath64 . for the existence of solutions it suffices , in most cases , to consider its behavior at @xmath68",
    "; for the multiplicity results a more careful study is needed , in order to find `` large enough '' intervals of positivity and negativity of @xmath64 . with that end in mind",
    ", we shall consider the sets @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71 so we may write @xmath72 for notation convenience , we also define @xmath73 .",
    "this setting proves to be useful , since the limits @xmath74 are easy to compute and , moreover , @xmath75 is strictly monotone for @xmath76 and a sum of one - hump functions for @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the behavior of @xmath64 can be understood by studying the interaction of these different terms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we adapt the abstract continuation theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 2.1 ) to equation ( [ bbg ] ) and prove the existence of positive @xmath15-periodic solutions for the different cases . in section [ mult ] ,",
    "we give sufficient conditions for the existence of @xmath78 , @xmath79 or @xmath80 positive @xmath15-periodic solutions . finally , in section [ exa ] we give an example with at least @xmath81 positive @xmath15-periodic solutions .",
    "in order to present our existence results in a more comprehensive way , we shall consider three different cases : the _ superlinear _ case ( @xmath82 for some @xmath41 ) , the the _ sublinear _ case ( @xmath83 for all @xmath41 ) and the _ asymptotically linear _ case ( @xmath84 for all @xmath41 and @xmath85 for some @xmath86 ) .",
