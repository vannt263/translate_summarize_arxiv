    "<S> the inversion procedure is analogous to the quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) effect in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) . whereas angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and stm provide surface sensitive information , our inversion procedure provides bulk electronic properties . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is essentially model independent and can be applied to a wide variety of materials .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of cuprate superconductivity has led to the discovery of a number of unexpected relationships between seemingly different spectroscopies . </S>",
    "<S> stm provides an outstanding example of this : while basically a real - space probe , it can extract momentum-(@xmath0)-space information of the electronic fermi surface and sc pairing symmetry usually associated with arpes . </S>",
    "<S> elastic scattering of cooper pairs leads to the qpi pattern measured by stm.@xcite by analyzing the qpi pattern as a function of scattering angle ( in @xmath1-space ) it is possible to reconstruct both band structure and gap information in @xmath0-space . </S>",
    "<S> while the technique was originally developed for @xmath2-wave cuprates , it is finding wide applications in other materials , including pnictides , where the sc gap is probably of @xmath3 symmetry , and in topological insulators in the non - superconducting state .    </S>",
    "<S> the development of a similar technique for ins would have obvious advantages . </S>",
    "<S> first , arpes and stm are surface sensitive probes , which in practice means that they can only be performed on materials that are readily cleaved . </S>",
    "<S> for the same reason , they are mainly restricted to quasi - two - dimensional materials , and the question always remains how sensitive the results are to surface effects , such as pinning , reconstruction , and excess scattering . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , ins is a bulk probe which does not need special surface preparation and can readily be applied to three - dimensional materials . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , ins results on heavy fermion materials were available years before the first high - resolution arpes studies . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that inelastic scattering between the particle and hole bogoliubov quasiparticles generates a similar magnetic quasiparticle scattering ( mqps ) profile which can be probed directly by ins measurements.@xcite taking all three spectroscopies together , we are able to establish a definite consistency between the @xmath4space ( stm ) , @xmath5space ( arpes ) , and @xmath6space ( ins ) dynamics of the unconventional bogoliubov quasiparticles .    </S>",
    "<S> the overall phenomenology of neutron scattering in cuprates is well - known , and a number of universal features have been experimentally identified@xcite and theoretically interpreted.@xcite the results indicate that a distinct low energy magnetic mode is present near the antiferromagnetic nesting vector @xmath7 in almost all the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of this mode is enhanced in the sc state while its energy scales @xmath8 for all cuprates@xcite , suggesting a close connection of these modes with sc pairing . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion of spectral weight away from this resonance peak also has a universal character , forming an ` hour - glass'-like pattern centered on the resonance mode and displaying a 45@xmath9 rotation on passing through the resonance peak . </S>",
    "<S> below the resonance energy , spectral weight disperses along the cu - o bond direction , while above the resonance the dispersion peak lies along the diagonal direction . despite an overall universality , many features of this ` hourglass ' dispersion are highly material specific and we show that the difference comes mainly from the nature of the pseudogap order among other band structure related properties .    </S>",

    "<S> the ins experiments , which measure the imaginary part of the transverse spin - spin correlation function @xmath19 , can also be understood through an analogy with the qpi pattern.@xcite indeed , since @xmath20 is related to the joint density - of - states ( jdos ) , the neutron scattering will be dominated by transitions from banana tips below the fermi level to banana tips above the fermi level , as illustrated by the dotted cyan arrow in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> there are 7 @xmath24vectors at any energy that connect a given banana point to the other banana points.@xcite however , in ins there is a coherence factor which allows only the poles for which @xmath25 and @xmath26 have opposite signs , since the magnetic neutron scattering cross - section is odd under time - reversal symmetry.@xcite hence we identify four neutron scattering vectors which dominate in cuprates and give rise to a spin excitation profile , which can be called mqps pattern , in analogy with the qpi patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the mqps vectors can be denoted as @xmath27 , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> however , we show below that this is not a problem : the gap and fs can be reconstructed from ins data along any @xmath31 cut . </S>",
    "<S> ins data are mostly available along the diagonal cut @xmath32 , and along the bond direction , i.e. @xmath33 $ ] and equivalent cuts as a function of energy . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore define the spanning vectors as @xmath34 and @xmath35 along the diagonal direction and @xmath36 and @xmath37 along the bond direction [ note that @xmath38 does not lie on these two special cuts ] . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal cut is a particularly simple choice , since along this cut the mqps vectors are exclusively associated with special points , for which @xmath39 . for these special points </S>",

    "<S> the associated arrows indicate the direction each vector moves as the excitation energy increases which is simply a manifestation of the shape of the fermi pocket and the @xmath10wave superconducting gap values at each fermi momentum . to see this , we draw an illustrative energy versus momentum dispersion relation for two @xmath29 vectors along the diagonal direction in fig .  1(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> branch @xmath34 disperses from @xmath42 , where the incommensurate @xmath34-vector connects pairs of nodal points , and hence measures the width of the hole pocket , to the resonance peak at @xmath43 at the maximum @xmath44 connecting the hot - spots at the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone  that is , @xmath34 is the dispersion branch associated with the magnetic resonance peak . </S>",
    "<S> branch @xmath35 represents an intrapocket scattering , and the corresponding branch starts from @xmath45 , @xmath42 at the nodal point , dispersing towards a @xmath35-vector which spans the length of the hole pocket when @xmath44 . thus both curves attain the maximal @xmath16 when the banana points correspond to the hot spots along the brillouin zone diagonals  the maximal diagonals of the hole pockets . </S>",
    "<S> a similar phenomenon is found in the experimental qpi spectra.@xcite in summary , the inelastic mqps intensity pattern at an energy @xmath46 in neutron scattering exactly corresponds to the elastic qpi pattern seen at an energy @xmath47 in stm , and hence can also be used to reconstruct the fermi surface and sc gap properties .    </S>",
    "<S> to illustrate how the above results play out in practice , we compare them to experiment and to realistic calculations of ins . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the ins spectrum of the cuprates from a one - band hubbard model , with self - energy corrections from a gw calculation called the quasiparticle - gw ( qp - gw ) model.@xcite the qp - gw hamiltonian consists of four components which are calculated self - consistently : @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic dispersion , @xmath49 , is based on a tight - binding fit to the material - specific first - principles single band dispersion of the antibonding combination of cu @xmath50 and o @xmath51 orbitals.@xcite the pseudogap state of the cuprates is treated as a spin - density wave ( sdw ) , @xmath52 , based on a hubbard term in the hamiltonian , which is treated using standard random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) theory.@xcite below @xmath53 , @xmath2-wave sc order develops @xmath54 which couples naturally to the sdw state.@xcite the resulting energy spectrum is @xmath55 , where the non - superconducting dispersion for both spin states are @xmath56 [ for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the non - interacting band in the bloch state , and @xmath60 is the effective sdw gap which produces the pseudogap above the antiferromagnetic zone boundary ] . the sdw gap causes a substantially reconstructed fermi surface ( fs ) at low - temperature as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> at low temperature the @xmath10wave superconducting gap coexists with the sdw state . by fixing @xmath61 and the pairing interaction @xmath62 , to account for the experimental values of pseudogap and superconducting gap respectively </S>",
    "<S> ( see table i ) , there are no free parameters in the susceptibility calculation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we calculate the self energy due to the magnetic and charge excitations which renormalizes the overall dispersion by a momentum independent mass renormalization .    the full susceptibility is computed in all spin channels within random phase approximation ( rpa ) . in rpa , the resonance pole is determined by the real part of the lindhard susceptibility , @xmath63 which attains a logarithmic divergence at all the bogoliubov quasiparticle scattering vectors . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously @xmath64 possess discontinuous jump due to kramer s kronig relation . in this spirit , the positive divergence in @xmath63 or the discontinuous jump in @xmath64 can be used as an indicator of the observed the magnetic spectra in the sc state . in the sdw state , the situation is more complicated , nevertheless , the overall phenomenology can be discussed approximately by the imaginary part of the transverse spin susceptibility which mainly consists of three important factors ( see appendix for more details ) : @xmath65 here , @xmath66 , which converges to eq .  2 on the fermi surface [ @xmath67 . since the ins spectrum is proportional to the rpa susceptibility @xmath19 , the associated intensity of a given pole in the spectrum is controlled mainly by the two coherence factors @xmath68 and @xmath69 associated with antiferromagnetic zone folding and sc gap symmetry breaking , which can be approximated for discussion as @xmath70 at the normal state fermi surface [ @xmath67 , the superconducting coherence factor reduces to @xmath71 which attains its maximum value of 1 whenever @xmath25 and @xmath72 have opposite signs , thereby explaining why the spectrum is dominated by the four magnetic scattering channels @xmath29 with @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at small @xmath74 , the sdw coherence factor , eq .  5 , simplifies@xcite to @xmath75 , which attains its maximum value of 1 at @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the intensity for @xmath34 branch being closer to @xmath41 dominates over the other branches and the intensity gradually increases to its maximum value at @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  2 presents our main result , showing that the dominant spectral features in neutron scattering correspond exactly to the mpqs features , in a sdw superconductor . for a specific example </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless the mqps branches @xmath34 and @xmath35 capture the essential shape of the two downward dispersions , while a spin wave branch is clearly seen dispersing upward away from the magnetic resonance feature .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two main sources of intensity variation for each @xmath86vector . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed earlier , the sdw coherence factor is strongly momentum dependent and reaches maximum at @xmath87 . since branch @xmath35 stops dispersing well </S>",

    "<S> the scattering vectors @xmath90 have one commensurate direction and one incommensurate one while @xmath91 are incommensurate along both @xmath92 and @xmath93directions except at the resonance at @xmath87 . thus @xmath94 connect twice as many fermi surface points as any other @xmath91 . as a result </S>",

    "<S> the lower branch of the experimental data which disperses downward from @xmath95 is associated with the @xmath34 scattering vectors . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by solving eq .  2 at the experimental points , we determine a map of @xmath96 which agrees very well with the theoretical fermi surface as well as with the arpes fs . </S>",
