    "the external forward shock model ( see , e.g. , rees & mszros 1992 ; mszros & rees 1993 , 1997 ; paczyski & rhoads 1993 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) has been very useful for studying the afterglow emission of grbs ( gamma - ray bursts ; for a review , see , e.g. , piran 2004 ) .",
    "this model explains the long - lasting emission in x - ray , optical and radio bands as synchrotron emission ( e.g. , sari et al . 1998 , granot & sari 2002 ) from circum - stellar medium ( csm ) electrons that have been accelerated to high lorentz factors ( lfs ) by the shock produced in the interaction between the grb jet and the csm ( for synchrotron - self - compton emission , see , e.g. , sari & esin 2001 , nakar , ando & sari 2009 ) .",
    "one of the main questions that remains unanswered is the origin of the magnetic field in the region where the electrons radiate , expressed as @xmath0 : the fraction of the total energy behind the shock in the magnetic field .",
    "there are two ways to determine @xmath0 : ( 1 ) through afterglow modeling ( e.g. , wijers & galama 1999 ; panaitescu & kumar 2002 ; yost et al .",
    "2003 , panaitescu 2005 ) ; and ( 2 ) through theoretical studies of magnetic field generation mechanisms ( e.g. , medvedev & loeb 1999 ; milosavljevi & nakar 2006 ; sironi & goodman 2007 ; goodman & macfadyen 2008 ; couch , milosavljevi , nakar 2008 ; zhang et al . 2009",
    "; mizuno et al .",
    "2011 ; inoue , asano & ioka 2011 ) .    the value of @xmath0 can be determined via afterglow modeling for grbs that have been _ extensively _ followed at different wavelengths .",
    "the reason is that the synchrotron spectrum consists of four power - law segments , which are divided by three characteristic frequencies , and observations should provide information about either the four different segments or the three characteristic frequencies ( plus the peak flux ) or a combination of the two that allows us to determine the afterglow parameters _",
    "uniquely_. in cases where extensive afterglow follow - up at different wavelengths is not available , then various assumptions have to be made in order to determine the afterglow parameters ; these assumptions add to the uncertainty in the afterglow parameters . in addition , past studies have made different assumptions , which have made comparison between different works difficult .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide a systematic study , where we make the same assumptions for all grbs in our sample .",
    "this allows us to obtain an @xmath0 distribution for which one can draw meaningful conclusions .    in this paper , using radio afterglow observations , we calculate a lower limit on @xmath0 .",
    "this value is obtained by assuming that the radio emission is produced by the external forward shock and that the time when the radio light curve starts to decay at a few to tens of days is due to the passage of the minimum ( injection ) frequency through the radio band .",
    "the observed peak of the radio light curve indicates then the spectral peak of the external forward shock , @xmath1 , which depends on @xmath0 as @xmath2 ( e.g. , granot & sari 2002 ) and allows for an estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "the reason why @xmath0 is a minimum is because we conservatively ignore if a `` jet break '' has been observed or not .",
    "the `` jet break '' occurs when the opening angle of the jet is approximately equal to the inverse of the blast wave lorentz factor and at this time the light curves show an achromatic break ( e.g. , rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran , halpern 1999 ) .",
    "after the `` jet break '' , @xmath1 decays with time faster than before it , therefore , if the light curve peaks after the `` jet break '' , our method would yield a larger value of @xmath0 .",
    "the identification of the `` jet break '' is not always a straightforward issue ( e.g. , liang et al . 2008 ; kocevski & butler 2008 ; racusin et al . 2009 ; leventis et al .",
    "this is the reason why we chose a conservative approach and estimated a lower limit on @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , a subsample of grbs in this work have available `` jet break '' times , which have been estimated in combination with optical and/or x - ray afterglows . for this subsample",
    ", the lower limit can be transformed into a measurement , but not without keeping in mind the uncertainties mentioned above .",
    "the lower limits / measurements of @xmath0 in this study depend on the blast wave total energy and the density of the csm .",
    "however , assuming a magnetic field in the csm , we can express our value of @xmath0 as a ratio of the magnetic field behind the shock , @xmath11 , to the csm shock - compressed magnetic field , @xmath12 , which turns out to be independent of csm density .",
    "this ratio , @xmath8 , allows us to determine how much amplification  beyond shock compression  is needed .",
    "since we are using mainly radio data , we make certain assumptions to determine @xmath8 ( as mentioned above ) .",
    "however , in this particular study , the only unknowns are the total energy in the blast wave , which can be determined with some degree of confidence by knowing the observed gamma - ray radiated energy during the grb , and the seed ( unshocked ) magnetic field in the csm , which is taken to be @xmath6 @xmath7 g .",
    "the method presented in this paper provides a quick way to estimate a lower limit / measurement of @xmath0 ( and @xmath8 ) ; it should not be used as a substitute for careful and dedicated afterglow modeling , but it certainly provides a novel way to handle a large number of grbs easily .",
    "the present paper follows the work by santana , barniol duran & kumar ( 2014 ) , in which they use optical and x - ray data to determine @xmath0 for a large number of bursts .",
    "the main idea of their work is to : 1 .",
    "use the optical emission to determine @xmath0 by assuming that this emission was produced in the external forward shock , and 2 . use the x - ray steep decay observed in many x - ray light curves , which does _ not _ have an external shock origin , to place an upper limit on @xmath0 by assuming that the external forward shock emission is below the observed steep decay .",
    "the present work attempts to use another wavelength , the radio band , to determine @xmath0 by yet another method , and thus compare our findings with those of santana et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and other authors .    in section ",
    "[ theory ] we present how a measurement of @xmath0 ( or a lower limit ) can be obtained using the peak of the radio light curve .",
    "we present our sample in  [ sample ] , which is taken from chandra & frail ( 2012 ) .",
    "this sample is used to obtain a lower limit on @xmath0 , and also to obtain a measurement of @xmath0 for those bursts which have an estimate of the jet break time .",
    "we present our results in the form of histograms in  [ results ] .",
    "we discuss these results and present our conclusions in  [ final ] .",
    "in the external forward shock model ( see , e.g. , sari et al . 1998 ) the injection ( or minimum ) frequency , @xmath13 , which is the synchrotron frequency at which the injected electrons with the minimum lf radiate behind the shock , decreases with time as @xmath14 . at @xmath13 ,",

    ", @xmath13 is predicted to be in the radio domain , @xmath15 .",
    "thus , radio afterglow observations provide the best opportunity to determine the value of @xmath1 .      the radio afterglow light curve , for @xmath16 ,",
    "is predicted to rise slowly with time as @xmath17 ( stay constant ) for the case of constant csm ( wind profile ) , and to start decreasing at the time when @xmath18 , which we denote as @xmath19 ( referred to as @xmath20 in the notation of sari et al .",
    "this is true if @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the jet break time ( rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran , halpern 1999 ) .",
    "the predicted synchrotron peak flux in the external forward shock occurs at @xmath13 and it is given by ( granot & sari 2002 )    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the power - law index for the energy distribution of injected electrons , @xmath3 is the isotropic kinetic energy in the external shock , @xmath4 is the csm density , @xmath25 is the redshift and @xmath26 is the luminosity distance in leventis et al .",

    ", we would like to address the possibility that the peak of the radio light curve is due to the passage of the self - absorption frequency , @xmath43 through the radio band , instead of the passage of @xmath13 as considered above .",
    "consider @xmath44 . in this case",
    ", @xmath43 is a constant for a constant csm , so we must consider a wind profile . for this profile , @xmath45 , and",
    "the passage of @xmath43 only makes the light curve transition from @xmath46 to @xmath47 ; it does not make the light curve decrease .",
    "therefore , a later passage of @xmath13 through @xmath15 ( as considered above ) is necessary to have a declining light curve . alternatively , since @xmath13 decreases very rapidly , @xmath44 could transition quickly to @xmath48 . in that case",
    ", we would first get the passage of @xmath13 through @xmath15 , which would make the light curve transition from @xmath17 to @xmath49 ( @xmath46 to @xmath50 ) for a constant csm ( wind profile ) , and then we would get the passage of @xmath43 through @xmath15 , which would make the light curve decrease . this last scenario is a definite possibility to explain the peak of radio light curves ; however , most radio light curves have a shallower rise , which strongly suggests the passage of @xmath13 through the radio band as the origin of their peak .",
    "we use the radio afterglow light curves of chandra & frail ( 2012 ) .",
    "they use a simple formula ( @xmath17 and @xmath51 , below and above the peak , respectively ) to fit the radio light curves .",
    "they acknowledge that this fit may not be too accurate to represent the entire light curve , however , it is good enough to determine the approximate values of the peak flux , @xmath31 , and the time of the peak , @xmath29 ( they use the notation @xmath52 and @xmath20 , respectively , see their table 4 ) .",
    "these two values , instead of the precise temporal properties of the emission , are the crucial values needed in our analysis .    for the case when the radio light curve starts decaying _ before _ the jet break , then it is easy to identify the fit done in chandra & frail ( 2012 ) as an indication of when @xmath13 crosses the radio band and use eq .",
    "( [ epsilon_b_peak_flux ] ) to determine @xmath0 ( see section [ theory_before_jet ] ) .",
    "this is true for the constant density medium case . for the wind case",
    ", the fit should have been @xmath47 before the peak ; however , since we are interested in the flux and time when the light curve starts to decrease , then this is also approximately valid for the wind case . for the case when the radio light curve starts decaying _ after _ the jet break , then the identification of @xmath13 is not as straightforward . for this case , strictly speaking , one should have allowed for a different fit with three power - laws : @xmath17 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 for a constant density medium , or simply @xmath47 , @xmath54 for a wind medium , as described in the previous section .",
    "however , the approximate fit done in chandra & frail ( 2012 ) and their values of @xmath29 and @xmath31 will still approximately indicate the time when @xmath13 crossed the radio band and the flux at that time .",
    "therefore , for this case we can use eq .",

    "( [ epsilon_b_peak_flux ] ) to determine a lower limit on @xmath0 .",
    "a detailed fit done to each of the radio light curves could in principle indicate the time of the jet break and the time when @xmath13 crosses the radio band ( and eliminate a possible small source of error in our calculation , which arises from differences in the fit done in chandra & frail 2012 and the one described in the previous section ) . if more than one radio band is available , then this task is even more certain .",
    "however , in cases when the radio data is sparse , or scintillation plays a major role ( frail et al .",
    "2000 ) , then one needs to rely on optical or x - ray data to extract the time of the jet break . in this particular study",
    ", we use the jet break values compiled in the table 1 in chandra & frail ( 2012 ) , which are obtained using either optical , x - ray or radio observations , and sometimes a combination of two or more bands .",
    "we begin our sample selection with all 54 grbs reported on table 4 of chandra & frail ( 2012 ) for which there were enough data points to determine @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",

    "we , therefore , conclude that our results on @xmath0 obtained using the constraint on the radio peak flux are in agreement with the location of the injection frequency at the time of the peak , keeping in mind the uncertainties in this calculation .",
    "assuming that the radio grb light curve originates in the external forward shock and that its peak at a few to tens of days is due to the passage of the injection frequency through the radio band ( before or after the jet break ) , we have found a lower limit / measurement for the fraction of the energy in the magnetic field to the total energy in the shocked fluid behind the shock , @xmath0 .",
    "this lower limit ( or measurement , for those bursts with estimates of the jet break time ) depends on the isotropic kinetic energy in the external shock , which is calculated assuming that the efficiency in producing gamma - rays is about 20 per cent .",

    "we have also expressed our results as a function of the ratio of the magnetic field behind the shock , @xmath11 , to the expected shock - compressed csm field , @xmath12 , and we have taken the unshocked csm field to be @xmath117 g .",
    "this ratio is an important quantity since it is independent of the csm density , and it indicates the level , above simple shock compression , that the magnetic field should be amplified .",
    "however , @xmath8 does depend on the assumed value of @xmath72 as @xmath118",
    ".    a clear prediction of our model is that the radio spectral index @xmath119 , @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the specific flux , should be positive ( @xmath122 ) before the radio light curve peak and then it should become negative ( @xmath123 for @xmath124 ) after it , if the peak in the light curve is produced by the passage of the injection frequency through the radio band .",
    "this can be tested for radio afterglows that have data at different radio wavelengths before and after the light curve peak .",
    "a possible uncertainty in our study is the fact that the peak in the radio afterglow light curve could also have a contribution of an external reverse shock component .",
    "chandra & frail ( 2012 ) , in their table 4 , reported : 1 .",
    "the second peak of afterglow light curves that showed two peaks and , 2 .",
    "they did not report peaks that occurred earlier than 3 days of afterglow light curves that showed a single peak to avoid a possible reverse shock contribution to the observed peak flux .",
    "nevertheless , if the peak flux in the radio afterglow light curve that we have used has a non - negligible contribution from the reverse shock , then the true value of @xmath0 in the forward shock would actually be smaller than the one we calculated , see eq .",
    "( [ epsilon_b_peak_flux ] ) .",
    "another uncertainty is the fact that the jet break could have been misinterpreted .",
    "for this reason , in addition to determining a measurement on @xmath0 ( and @xmath8 ) , we have chosen also to determine a lower limit , for which the time of the jet break is not used .",
    "this is a conservative approach , given the fact that jet breaks might be more difficult to identify as thought before ( e.g. , leventis et al .",
    "2013 and references therein ) .",
    "keeping in mind the uncertainties discussed in the previous paragraphs , we would like to determine whether the magnetic field behind the external forward shock in grbs could be produced by simple shock - compressed csm magnetic field ( as found for a small sample of _ fermi _ satellite grbs , see , kumar & barniol duran 2009 , 2010 ; barniol duran & kumar 2011a , 2011b ) or if an additional amplification mechanism is needed .",
    "the first thing to determine is the value of the unshocked csm magnetic field , which is the value of the field in the vicinity of the grb explosion and we have taken it to be @xmath73 @xmath7 g .",
    "the reason for our choice of @xmath72 is that in the milky way the field is about @xmath125 @xmath7 g near the sun and several @xmath126 @xmath7 g in filaments near the galactic center ( beck 2009 ) .",
    "values of @xmath127 @xmath7 g have been measured in radio - faint galaxies ( with star formation rate of sfr @xmath128/yr ) , @xmath6 @xmath7 g in normal spiral galaxies , @xmath129 @xmath7 g in gas - rich spiral galaxies with high star formation rates ( sfr @xmath130/yr ) , and @xmath131 @xmath7 g in starburst galaxies ( sfr @xmath132/yr ) ( beck 2012 ) .",
    "the measurements of the global field of these galaxies suggest that @xmath72 could be @xmath133 g .",
    "this means that values of up to @xmath134 could be consistent with simple shock - compression of a seed field .",
    "this suggests that for our sample of lower limits , for 22/38 bursts ( 58 per cent ) the shock compression origin of the magnetic field is not ruled out and remains a viable possibility .",
    "the same applies for 7/23 burst ( 30 per cent ) in our subsample of measurements .",
    "the remaining bursts in both samples , which have larger values of @xmath8 , would need an amplification mechanism beyond shock - compression , unless @xmath72 is larger in these bursts for some reason .    as suggested by the measurements presented in the previous paragraph ( see , e.g. , beck 2009 ) and also by larger fields of @xmath135 mg obtained in starburst galaxies with sfr @xmath136/yr ( robishaw , quataert & heiles 2008 ) , galaxies with higher sfr tend to have higher global fields .",
    "the strength of the global field might be correlated with the field in the vicinity of the grb , @xmath72 .",
    "if this is the case , then simple shock - compression would remain a viable possibility for those bursts for which we have found large values of @xmath8 , if they reside within galaxies with high sfr .",
    "this idea is in the spirit of the work of thompson , quataert & murray ( 2009 ) , where they find that for supernova remnants ( snrs ) fields larger than that due to shock - compression alone might not be needed for snr in starbursts ( nor for the average snr in most normal spirals , although it might be needed for individual snrs at particular moments of time ) .",
    "we find that 13 grbs out of our sample of 23 have their host galaxy sfr reported in savaglio , glazebrook & le borgne ( 2009 ) .",
    "we present these values in table [ table2 ] and plot them as a function of our values of @xmath8 and as a function of redshift in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "there is no correlation between sfr and @xmath8 , nor ssfr ( specific sfr ) and @xmath8 .",
    "this does not support the idea that bursts with high values of @xmath8 reside within galaxies with high sfr , and therefore they do require an amplification beyond shock - compression .",
    "this assumed however that the global galactic field is a proxy of the field in the vicinity of the grb progenitor , @xmath72 , which might not be the case with a progenitor that regulates the medium and the magnetic fields in its vicinity via winds or other mechanisms , or if the pre - shocked magnetic field is strongly amplified by instabilities that operate ahead of the shock ( e.g. , milosavljevi & nakar 2006 ) .",
    "we also report the morphology of grb host galaxies ( wainwright et al .",
    "2007 ) in table [ table2 ] , using the notation in savaglio et al .",
    "only 10 grbs of our sample of 23 have reported morphologies .",
    "table [ table2 ] is presented in descending order of @xmath8 .",
    "there is no clear indication that grbs hosted by galaxies of different morphologies have different strengths of @xmath8 .",
    "however , as mentioned above , global host galaxy properties might not represent the properties in the vicinity of the grb .",
    "we emphasize that the ideas discussed in this paragraph and in the previous one are based on small number statistics and depend on the jet break time estimate .",
    "larger samples in the future could be used to test them and redshift for the entire sample , nor for the subsample with sfr . ] .    using x - ray and optical data for a sample of grb afterglows , santana et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have also constrained @xmath0 : an upper limit with their x - ray sample and a measurement with their optical sample .",
    "we find that 4 grbs : grb 071003 , grb 080603a , grb 090313 ( in their optical sample ) , and grb 100814a ( in their x - ray sample ) , are common to our radio sample .",
    "using the same assumptions , we find that our lower limits on @xmath0 for these 4 grbs are consistent with the 3 measurements of @xmath0 ( optical sample ) and the upper limit on @xmath0 ( x - ray sample ) in santana et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , showing that their methods and ours are consistent with each other .",
    "we note that our lower limits are only smaller by a factor of @xmath137 than the measurements / upper limits of these 4 grbs .",
    "this means that for these 4 bursts the lower limits on @xmath0 are a good estimate of their actual values and , thus , require that @xmath138 .",
    "only one of these 4 grbs is in our subsample of grbs with know jet break , grb 090313 .",
    "we find that our @xmath0 estimate using radio data is a factor of 100 larger than the one reported in santana et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , since for this burst @xmath139 .",
    "this grb has the highest @xmath0 value in table [ table2 ] ( and abnormally high compared with the rest of the sample ) . after inspecting its optical / x - ray afterglow , we find that its jet break time ( @xmath140 day ) is based only on x - ray observations , since at this time the optical afterglow displays flares , and also contamination from a nearby source ( berger 2009 , mao et al .",
    "2009 , melandri et al . 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , this jet break can be regarded as questionable , but we decided to keep it in table [ table2 ] and fig .",

    "santana et al .",
    "( 2014 ) find a weak correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath0",
    ". we do not find it in our radio sample with estimated jet break times , which might be due to the uncertainties in @xmath22 .",
    "finally , the mean / median value found for @xmath10 in our radio sample ( for both the lower limits and the measurements ) agrees very well with the value found in santana et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , where they report @xmath141 .",
    "we note that three very different methods ( using radio , optical and x - ray data ) yield consistent values of the level of amplification needed in grb relativistic collisionless shocks .",
    "lemoine et al .",
    "2013 have studied bursts with @xmath142 mev ( detected by the _",
    "fermi _ satellite ) , x - ray , optical and radio data .",
    "they explain all these observations in the context of the external forward shock ( see , e.g. , kumar & barniol duran 2009 ) . however , they consider a decaying field behind the shock ( lemoine 2013 ) , where the @xmath142 mev emission is produced by electrons close to the shock front , where @xmath143 and the x - ray , optical , and radio emission is produced by electrons further downstream of the shock front , where @xmath144 . the latter value of @xmath0 is consistent with our obtained median of @xmath145 using radio data .",
    "we note that the median value of @xmath0 found in this work , by assuming @xmath65 @xmath66 and a 20 per cent efficiency in producing the prompt emission gamma - rays , is a factor of @xmath146 smaller than the median value found in , e.g. , panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 ) , in which a detailed multiwavelength analysis of several of the bursts in our sample are presented .",
    "the main difference is that the median density found in panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 ) is @xmath6 times larger and the median efficiency is @xmath147 per cent . also , the numerical pre - factor used in eq .",
    "( [ peak_flux ] ) in granot & sari ( 2002 ) is much larger than the one used in panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 ) , and since eqs .",
    "( [ epsilon_b_peak_flux ] ) and ( [ epsilon_b_peak_flux_2 ] ) depend on this pre - factor squared , then the effect is to lower @xmath0 considerably .",
    "a similar conclusion applies to our results regarding @xmath8 .",
    "we would like to finish by comparing our values of @xmath8 with the ones found for young shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "there is some evidence for field amplification in galactic snrs with levels of @xmath148 at particular moments of time ( e.g. , vlk et al .",
    "2002 , vlk , berezhko & ksenofontov 2005 , berezhko , ksenofontov & vlk 2006 , see , also , recently , castro et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar level of amplification as the one presented in this work and in santana et al .",
    "( 2014 ) is observed in these systems .",
    "taken at face value , this might indicate a common amplification mechanism in grb relativistic afterglows and non - relativistic snrs , which might even be found in other very different systems .",
    "we should caution , however , that the environment in the vicinity of the grb explosion remains uncertain and every possible effort to characterize it should be made .",
    "this work emphasizes the importance of radio afterglow observations in studying relativistic collisionless shocks . by using the simple method presented here",
    ", one can extract valuable information about the magnetic field behind the shock for grbs , which have not been monitored extensively at other wavelengths to allow for a complete and detailed afterglow modeling .",
