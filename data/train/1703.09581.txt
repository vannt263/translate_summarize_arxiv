    "infectious diseases remain a threat for developing countries as well as for developed countries .",
    "many mathematicians focus their efforts to understand the dynamics of infectious diseases , in order to find the conditions to eradicate them . in mathematical modelling of infectious disease epidemics , the population in which the disease is spreading is partitioned in several compartments according to the status of the individuals , related to the disease .",
    "every epidemic model has at least , the compartment @xmath0 of the infectious individuals who are infected and able to transmit the disease to others through contact , and the compartment @xmath1 of the susceptible individuals ( those who are not infected but may be infected if they contact an infectious individual ) .",
    "two other compartments often used are the compartment @xmath2 of the exposed or latent individuals who are already infected but not yet able to transmit the disease to others , and the compartment @xmath3 of the recovered or removed individuals ( those who are healed from the disease with a permanent or non - permanent immunity ) . in a @xmath4 epidemic ,",
    "a susceptible individual infected through a contact with an infectious , becomes infected and latent ; at the end of the latent period he / she becomes infectious and at the end of the infectious period he / she recovers with a life - long immunity .",
    "an @xmath5 epidemic is almost the same as the preceding , the only difference is that a recovered individual has a non - permanent immunity ( he / she can lose his immunity , becoming susceptible again ) .",
    "diphtheria , influenza and pneumonia are examples of diseases with latent period and non - permanent immunity @xcite .    in @xcite , britton and trapman studied stochastic sir and seir models in a growing population .",
    "they derived the basic reproduction number and the malthusian parameter of the epidemic , stated results for the initial phase and showed that the stochastic proportions process converges to a deterministic process .    in @xcite",
    ", greenhalgh studied an seirs deterministic model with vaccination and found that under some conditions , the solution has hopf bifurcations .    the aim of this paper is to study the dynamic of a stochastic seirs epidemic model with disease induced mortality , in an exponentially growing population . as in @xcite , we assume that without the disease , the population has a birth rate @xmath6 , and a natural death rate @xmath7 , such that @xmath8 .",
    "that is , initially the population process is a super - critical linear birth and death process .",
    "an seirs epidemic is introduced by infecting one individual . with the disease ,",
    "the population is divided in four compartments according to the status of the individuals , related to the disease .",
    "the compartment s of the susceptible individuals , the compartment e of the latent or exposed individuals , the compartment i of the infectious individuals , and the compartment r of the removed individuals ( those who are healed of the disease with a non - permanent immunity ) .",
    "the process is initiated by setting @xmath9 .",
    "the transfer diagram of the model is given by figure [ seirsdiagram ] .",
    "we derive the malthusian parameter @xmath10 , the basic reproduction number @xmath11 and the probability of minor outbreak @xmath12 of the epidemic .",
    "if @xmath13 , then the disease can not invade the population , that remains a super critical process . if @xmath14 , then the epidemic has a positive probability @xmath15 of taking off , with the remaining probability @xmath12 , it dies out .",
    "if the epidemic takes off , another threshold parameter @xmath16 determines the behavior of the proportion of infected individuals .",
    "if @xmath17 , then the _ fraction _ of infected stays small ; while it persists when @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath18 , or equivalently @xmath19 , then the _ number _ of the infected grows initially quicker than the population , the disease fatalities diminish the growth rate of the population . in this case the asymptotic behavior of the population rely on a third threshold quantity @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 , then the population goes on growing , while it becomes a sub - critical process when @xmath22 . in the latter case , when the number of individuals become low , the population should vanish with the disease , or regrows after the extinction of the epidemic .",
    "we start by defining the stochastic model in section @xmath23 .",
    "then , in section @xmath24 , we study the initial phase of the epidemic , thereafter we consider the deterministic model in section @xmath25 . afterward , we give some illustrations by simulating different scenarios of epidemics in section @xmath26 . in section @xmath27 , we conclude the paper and discuss some perspectives .",
    "initially ( before the introduction of the disease ) , the population model is a linear birth and death ( b - d ) process with individual birth rate @xmath6 and individual death rate @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 , that is the process is super - critical .",
    "@xmath28 denotes the _ number _ of individuals in the population at time @xmath29 .",
    "now , we define a uniformly mixing markovian epidemic model on the population described above , implying that individuals give birth at rate @xmath6 and die from other causes at rate @xmath7 , irrespective of disease status .",
    "initially ( at @xmath30 ) , the population consists of @xmath31 susceptible individuals . at this time , an seirs infectious disease is introduced by infecting one individual .",
    "the disease spreading is modelled as follow .",
    "an infected individual remains latent ( infected but not yet infectious ) for exponential time with rate @xmath32 . after this period ,",
    "he / she becomes infectious ( unless he / she dies before ) .",
    "an infectious individual remains infectious for an exponential time with rate @xmath33 ( unless he / she dies before ) .",
    "the disease induces an additional death rate @xmath34 for the infectious individuals . after the period of infectiousness , an infectious individual recovers with a temporary immunity .",
    "a recovered person remains immune for an exponential time with rate @xmath35 unless he / she dies before . after the period of immunity he / she becomes susceptible again . during the infectious period ,",
    "the infective has infectious contacts randomly in time according to a homogeneous poisson process with rate @xmath36 , each time with a uniformly selected random individual .",
    "if the contacted person is susceptible , he / she becomes infected and latent ( not yet infectious ) , otherwise the contact has no effect .",
    "there is no vertical transmission , that is all the new born individuals are susceptible .",
    "let @xmath37 respectively denote the _ number _ of susceptible , latent , infectious and immune individuals at time @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the population size at time @xmath29 is @xmath38 ( wherever @xmath31 is important an @xmath31-index is added ) .",
    "the population is initiated at @xmath39 .",
    "however , later we also derive the probability of minor outbreak for an epidemic starting with @xmath40 latent individuals and @xmath41 infectious individuals with a very small infected _ fraction _ ( @xmath42 ) .    in short , the population model has two parameters , the birth rate @xmath6 and the death rate @xmath7 ; and the disease model has five parameters , the transmission rate @xmath36 , the end of latency rate @xmath32 , the recovery rate @xmath33 , the disease death rate @xmath34 and the immunity waning rate @xmath35 .",
    "the possible events and their rates , when currently in state @xmath43 , are given in table [ notations ] .",
    "the si , sis , sir , sirs , sei , seis , seir models are special cases of the seirs model defined above .",
    "if @xmath44 , then an infected individual can not go back to the susceptible state and we get an seir model . if @xmath45 , then the recovered state vanishes and we get an seis model . if @xmath46 , then the latent state vanishes giving an sirs model .",
    "if @xmath47 , then we have lifelong infectivity and hence an sei model .",
    "if @xmath46 and @xmath45 , then the latent state and the recovered state vanish and we have an sis model . if @xmath46 and @xmath48 , then the latent state vanishes and we have lifelong infectivity , giving hence an si model .",
    "therefore from the results of the seirs model , one can deduce those of the others .",
    ".the uniform markovian dynamic seirs epidemic : type of events , their state change @xmath49 ( the old state @xmath50 is hence changed to @xmath51 ) and their rates . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     these simulations confirm that when @xmath11 is less than @xmath52 , the disease can not invade the population , and that if @xmath11 is larger than @xmath52 , then with a positive probability @xmath53 , the disease can invade the population , and in this case the _ number _ of the infected individuals grows exponentially during the initial phase .      in this subsection",
    ", we show some simulations of major outbreaks , where the epidemic starts with a positive _ fraction _ of infected individuals .",
    "so the simulations illustrate what happens once the _ number _ of infected has reached a small but positive _ fraction _ of the community .",
    "we use the blue color for the susceptible , green for the exposed , red for the infectious and black for the recovered .",
    "we start by simulating the deterministic _ fraction _ s system . in figure",
    "[ seirs1 ] , we have four cases with @xmath54 respectively . in each case",
    "we have ten solutions paths of system ( [ seirsf system ] ) with different initial values . in ( a ) as in ( b ) , the @xmath55 solutions of system ( [ seirsf system ] ) approach the disease free equilibrium , confirming that if @xmath17 , then the disease free equilibrium of the deterministic fraction system is globally asymptotically stable in the feasible region . in ( c ) , all the @xmath55 solutions approach the same endemic equilibrium @xmath56 . in ( d ) , all the @xmath55 solutions approach the same endemic equilibrium @xmath57 . the results of ( c ) and ( d ) confirm that when @xmath18 , the disease free equilibrium is unstable and that there is an endemic equilibrium that is globally asymptotically stable in the interior of the feasible region .",
    "that is the endemic level is independent of the starting value .",
    "however the endemic equilibrium of ( d ) is different of that of ( c ) , hence the endemic equilibrium vary with the parameters values .    in the following we simulate both the stochastic and the deterministic models . in each case",
    ", we have simulated the stochastic epidemic , as well as integrated numerically the deterministic system ( [ seirssystem ] ) , both starting at the same values . from the _ numbers _ , we got the _ fractions _ by setting @xmath58 .",
    "one distinguishes the stochastic solutions from the deterministic by the fact that the deterministic solutions are represented by smooth lines , while the solutions of the stochastic solutions are represented by broken lines .    in figure [ seirssd4 ] , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the _ numbers _ of latent , infectious and recovered grow exponentially as the population , but the population growth rate is even larger and the _ fractions _ of the infected compartments go to _",
    "zero_. this means that , in term of the _ number _ of infected individuals , the disease is endemic , but the disease dies out in term of the _",
    "fractions_.    in figure [ seirssd1 ] , initially the _ number _ of the infected grows quicker than the _ number _ of the susceptible .",
    "after that , the _ number _ of the susceptible declines . afterward all the compartments grow exponentially , but with a rate @xmath61 that is lower than the initial growth rate of the population @xmath62 .",
    "the _ fractions _ go to an endemic equilibrium .    for figure [ seirssd5 ] ,",
    "the parameters are chosen such that equation ( [ equation1 ] ) is verified , allowing then the existence of endemic equilibrium for the deterministic system [ seirssystem ] . the asymptotic reproduction _",
    "number _ of the population @xmath63 , then for the deterministic solution , the population stabilizes , when @xmath64 . the stochastic _ numbers _",
    "fluctuate around the deterministic _",
    "numbers_. the _ fractions _ have the same behavior as that of the _ numbers_.    in figure [ seirssd3 ] , for the deterministic model , the epidemic turned the population exponential growth to an exponential decay due to the disease induced death rate , while the _ fractions _ go to an endemic equilibrium . for the stochastic model , the population size first decreases but at some instance when there are only few remaining individuals , the disease goes extinct and then the population size starts growing again .",
    "the deterministic model suggests that the population will go extinct , whereas in the stochastic model the disease first dies out and then the population becomes super critical again , thus regrowing . in the stochastic",
    "setting , what happens when the numbers become low is random .",
    "both the disease and the population could die out , or the population can grow again after the extinction of the epidemic . only analyzing the deterministic _ fraction",
    "_ model would give a misleading conclusion since the _ fractions _ seem to stabilize , whereas in what really happens is that all _ numbers _ in the deterministic model tend to @xmath65 .    in figure [ seirssd6",
    "] , we have the case where @xmath66 . for the stochastic model the disease goes extinct , while it persists in the deterministic one . in both models",
    "the population goes on growing exponentially . in ( b )",
    "we made a zoom to see the dynamics of @xmath67 and @xmath3 .",
    "these simulations show the different possible scenarios in the case of a major outbreak .",
    "they confirm the theoretical results and show the similarities and differences between the stochastic model and the deterministic model .",
    "now we simulate two influenza epidemics in burkina faso with two different basic reproduction numbers .",
    "burkina faso is an inland country of west africa .",
    "its population in @xmath68 is about @xmath69 .",
    "the individual annual birth rate and death rate are estimated to @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively @xcite .    according to the world health organization ( who ) @xcite , influenza is caused by a virus that attacks mainly the respiratory tract : the nose , the throat , the bronchi and rarely also the lungs .",
    "the infection usually lasts for about a week .",
    "it is characterized by sudden onset of high fever , myalgia , headache and severe malaise , non - productive cough , sore throat , and rhinitis .",
    "most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment .",
    "the virus is easily passed from person to person through the air by droplets and small particles excreted when infected individuals cough or sneeze .",
    "the influenza virus enters the body through the nose or the throat .",
    "it then takes between one and four days for the person to develop symptoms .",
    "someone suffering from influenza can be infectious from the day before he / she develops symptoms until seven days afterwards .",
    "the disease spreads very quickly among the population especially in crowded circumstances .",
    "cold and dry weather enables the virus to survive longer outside the body than in other conditions and , as a consequence , seasonal epidemics in temperate areas appear in winter .",
    "much less is known about the impact of influenza in the developing world .",
    "however , influenza outbreaks in the tropics where viral transmission normally continues year - round tend to have high attack and case - fatality rates .",
    "therefore by setting one year as the time unit , we make the following estimation for the influenza parameters .",
    "the latent period is approximately @xmath72 days , the infectious period is approximately @xmath73 days and the immunity period is approximately one year , thus @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "we set the influenza case fatality rate ( cfr ) to @xmath77 and deduce the influenza related death rate @xmath78 .",
    "the reproduction number of the @xmath79 pandemic influenza is estimated to be between @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "thus we set @xmath80 and deduce the contact number @xmath81 from the other parameters and equation ( [ r0 ] ) .",
    "we simulate the epidemic for a period of @xmath55 years starting in @xmath68 by integrating numerically the deterministic system ( [ seirssystem ] ) .",
    "figure [ burkina ] gives the evolution of the _ numbers _ of susceptible , latent , infectious and recovered individuals and the corresponding fractions during the @xmath55 years .",
    "figures [ burkina ] ( c ) and ( d ) , show respectively the dynamics of @xmath2 and @xmath0 and that of the _ fractions _",
    "@xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we have a peak with @xmath84 infectious individuals at the @xmath85 week of the epidemic . after that",
    "the _ number _ of infectious declines because the _ number _ of susceptible is low .",
    "afterward we have a minor peak every year due to the immunity waning and the newborns that increase the _ number _ of susceptible .",
    "the _ number _ of recovered individuals grow quickly and reach its maximum @xmath86 at the @xmath87 week .",
    "the _ fractions _ go to an endemic equilibrium through damped oscillations .",
    "the population in @xmath88 is estimated to @xmath89 individuals with @xmath90 susceptible , @xmath91 latent individuals , @xmath92 infectious individuals and @xmath93 recovered with non - permanent immunity .",
    "the number of recovered individuals is larger than the _ number _ of susceptible individuals .",
    "the _ fractions _ go to an endemic equilibrium with more than @xmath94 of the population infected at every time . as the influenza last about one week and we have @xmath95 weeks within a year , more than @xmath96 of the population should be infected during the year @xmath88 . that will have a very important negative impact on the economy of the country .",
    "we have @xmath97 and @xmath98 , thus @xmath16 and @xmath20 are both larger than @xmath52 and according to theorem [ r2 ] the _ fractions _ should go to an endemic equilibrium and all the compartments should grow exponentially .",
    "therefore the simulations agree with the theoretical results .",
    "the basic reproduction number for the novel influenza a ( h1n1 ) has been estimated to be between @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "thus , we set now @xmath101 and deduce the contact number from the other parameters .",
    "the results of this simulation are shown in figure [ burkina1 ] . in this case",
    "the epidemic and the population have globally the same dynamics as above .",
    "but the impact of the epidemic is fewer .",
    "the major peak of the epidemic happens later , at the @xmath102 week , with @xmath103 infectious individuals .",
    "contrary to the preceding case , the number of the recovered individuals is below the number of the susceptible individuals .    in @xcite ,",
    "coburn , wagner and blower simulated an influenza epidemic using a sir model with demography .",
    "their result for the _ number _ of infectious individuals ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 ( a ) ) is similar to that of figure [ burkina ] ( c ) and figure [ burkina1 ] ( c ) .",
    "we assume no seasonal effects . adding",
    "seasonality should make seasonal effects remain ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 ( b ) ) .",
    "the simulations of influenza in burkina faso show that in spite of the epidemic the population should go on growing .",
    "but the number of infected individuals will grow also .",
    "furthermore the peak of the epidemic in the first year show that the emergence of a new strain of influenza virus will be a very serious threat for the world . the global influenza program ( gip ) of the world health organization ( who ) , provides member states with strategic guidance , technical support and coordination of activities essential to make their health systems better prepared against this threat .    in this section",
    "we have illustrated and validated the theoretical results of the previous sections by simulations .",
    "in this paper we have studied a stochastic seirs epidemic model , with a disease related death , in a population which grows exponentially without the disease .",
    "we assumed that initially , the population process is a super - critical linear birth and death process with birth rate @xmath6 and death rate @xmath7 .",
    "we have derived , the basic reproduction number @xmath11 , the malthusian parameter @xmath10 and the probability of minor outbreak @xmath12 assuming that the initial size @xmath31 of the population tends to infinity .",
    "considering the deterministic model , we derived the threshold quantity @xmath16 for the _ fractions_.    if @xmath13 , then the disease dies out with probability @xmath52 .",
    "that is , there is no possibility of major outbreak if @xmath13 . in this case",
    ", the population remains a super - critical process .",
    "if @xmath14 then , with a positive probability , the epidemic can take off .",
    "if the epidemic takes off , then the _ number _ of the infected ( exposed or infectious ) individuals grows exponentially with rate @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath104 , then the _ sizes _ of all the compartments grow exponentially while the _ fraction _ of the infected individuals goes to @xmath65 .",
    "the _ number _ of infected people grows , but at a lower rate than the population , implying that the _ fraction _ infected becomes negligible .",
    "if @xmath19 , then the _ number _ of infected individuals grows initially with a rate that is larger than the population growth rate , and different scenarios are possible .",
    "due to the additional death rate @xmath34 in the infectious compartment , the population will go on growing but with a lower rate , or the population will become a sub - critical branching process and thus have a decreasing size . in the latter case the population vanishes in the deterministic model while in the stochastic one , what happens when the numbers become low is random . both the disease and the population could die out , or the population could grow again after the extinction of the epidemic .",
    "we have illustrated and validated the theoretical results by simulations .",
    "these simulations show the similarities and the differences between the stochastic model and the corresponding deterministic model . if @xmath14 , then in the deterministic model , the epidemic will invade the population surely ; while in the stochastic model , with a positive probability @xmath12 the disease vanishes .",
    "when @xmath105 , the population vanishes surely in the deterministic model ; whereas in the stochastic model , it can regrow exponentially after the extinction of the epidemic .",
    "one need to remember that an epidemic is always a stochastic process , and the deterministic model fits only when we have a large community with a large number of infectious individuals @xcite .",
    "for some diseases ( e.g. influenza , measles ) , the susceptibility and the infectiousness vary with the age of the individuals .",
    "therefore it is more realistic to consider an heterogeneous population as in @xcite . furthermore adding seasonal forcing",
    "will increase realism for seasonal diseases .",
    "for other diseases like sexually transmitted diseases ( std ) , a close and/or long contact is required for transmission .",
    "then the dynamics of the epidemic are linked to the special network in the host population @xcite . due to the development of the migration of populations , an epidemic starting in one location",
    "can be exported to another one quickly , then a meta - population model is convenient to find the conditions for a global health security @xcite . under the leadership of the world health organization ( who ) many policies ( vaccination , medication , quarantine , etc . )",
    "are implemented to prevent major outbreak of epidemics .",
    "nevertheless the infectious diseases remain a serious threat for humanity .",
    "another step towards realism is hence to extend this model by adding vaccination @xcite and treatment @xcite .",
    "this should allow to find the optimal control strategy to realize the herd immunity , that is to prevent the major outbreaks of infectious diseases .",
