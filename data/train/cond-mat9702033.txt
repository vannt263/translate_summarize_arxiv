    "the experimental measurement of a plasma edge in the infrared reflectivity of high - tc bulk superconductors@xcite @xmath5 , @xmath6@xcite , and @xmath7@xcite has brought a renewed interest in collective oscillations with the cooper pair density .",
    "previously , such studies were hampered by the well - known argument@xcite that the coulomb interaction shifts the frequency of such oscilations to above the gap frequency .",
    "recent theoretical studies@xcite support the view of a plasma oscillations along the c - axis , the direction orthogonal to the @xmath8 planes , caused by a large superconducting gap and a high anisotropy in these materials .    in superconducting films ,",
    "plasma oscillations have distinct properties .",
    "they exist in films regardless of their anisotropy or layered structure , and regardless of the type of pairing or even of the critical temperature value .",
    "this mode was predicted @xcite some time ago and was bothly observed in thin granular aluminium films , in the hundreds of @xmath9 range@xcite , and in thin @xmath6 films@xcite , in the higher frequency range of hundreds of @xmath10 .",
    "the study of propagating modes in films is not a new research field , they have been measured since long ago , in several materials ranging from metals@xcite to semiconductors@xcite , and also discussed in the theoretical literature@xcite .",
    "the novelty for the superconducting film is the very low frequency where these modes are observed and the strong temperature dependence , explained by a collective oscillation with the cooper pair density .",
    "recently@xcite it has been proposed that , similarly to metals and semiconductors , _ two _ branches of propagating modes should be observed in highly anisotropic superconducting films , e.g. , the high - tc compounds .",
    "the experimental observation of these two modes can provide a method to independently measure the london penetration lengths , parallel and perpendicular to the film surface .    in this paper",
    "we include into the study of mode propagation in films the existence of a c - axis plasma frequency , @xmath0 , inside the superconducting state .",
    "we only consider the c - axis perpendicular to the surfaces since this configuration is the most easily grown nowadays .",
    "the propagation of plasma modes above and below @xmath0 , their dispersion relations are our goals in the present paper .",
    "we restrict our study to waves that propagate along the surfaces of the superconducting film and evanesce in the dielectric medium perpendicularly to the surfaces .",
    "two very distinct behaviors are predicted , namely , field amplitudes that also evanesce inside the film away from the interfaces ( @xmath11 ) , and confined propagation , i.e. , waves propagate inside the superconductor along an oblique direction and reflect at the dielectric - superconductor interfaces ( @xmath12)@xcite . in many aspects this last case resembles propagation in optic fibers . in conclusion",
    "this paper considers a plasma frequency @xmath0 inside the superconducting state and studies its effects into wave propagation in films .",
    "the study of plasma modes in superconducting films with a plasma frequency @xmath0 has been previously considered by artemenko and kobelkov@xcite in the context of kinetic equations for green functions generalized to the case of layered superconductors with weak interlayer coupling .",
    "the present paper provides a more complete study of such modes than theirs because it shows that there are symmetric and antisymmetric modes for @xmath11 and discusses their several distinct regimes . the antisymmetric mode is intimately connected to the transverse current component , thus being highly sensitive to the transverse london penetration length , in the same fashion that the symmetric mode depends on the longitudinal london penetration length .",
    "we claim that these properties can be used to gain a better understanding of the transverse and longitudinal supercurrent components in anisotropic and layered films . besides",
    ", the present study is done in a framework distinct from those authors , we take the simplest possible theory , the london - maxwell theory for anisotropic materials , supposedly valid when all lengths are larger than the inter - layer separation @xmath13 . in the context of this theory",
    "we determine _ exactly _ the mode frequency , @xmath14 , as a function of its wavelength along the surfaces , @xmath15 , and of the remaining parameters : the two london penetration lengths , transverse ( @xmath16 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath17 ) to the surfaces ; the dielectric constant of the non - conducting medium exterior to the film , @xmath18 ; the film thickness @xmath19 ; and the isotropy and frequency independent @xmath20 , the simplest phenomenological choice for the superconductor s static dieletric constant .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , ( [ section1 ] )",
    ", we derive the dispersion relation equations , above and below the plasma frequency , using the london - maxwell theory , and solve them _",
    "exactly_. our study is restricted to identical top and bottom dielectric media .",
    "similar conclusions should also apply to the most general asymmetric case .",
    "section [ section2 ] deals with the @xmath11 case , where we study the two possible branches , the so - called symmetric ( lower ) and antisymmetric ( upper ) branches , and their three possible regimes : optical , coupled , and asymptotic . for each branch",
    "we derive , from our exact solution , useful approximated expressions for each of the above regimes . in this fashion",
    "many of the previous film studies are shown to be suitable approximations of our exact solutions . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we study wave propagation above @xmath0 and , obtain , from our exact dispersion relation , the several dispersion relation branches found by artemenko and kobelkov@xcite .",
    "we show that symmetry still plays an important role and the two branches below @xmath0 split into several ones , the symmetry of the state being determined by the number of half - wavelengths that fit perpendicularly to the film . in section [ section4 ] we apply the present theory to the high - tc superconductors , suitably choosing the parameter values .",
    "finally in section [ section5 ] we summarize our major results .",
    "the proof of some of results from our exact solution , such as the approximated expressions , are the subject of appendix [ apen ] .",
    "in this section we apply the london - maxwell theory to describe wave propagation in a superconducting film sandwiched between two identical non - conducting dielectric media@xcite",
    ". an external electromagnetic wave of frequency @xmath14 , and wavenumber @xmath21 , is absorbed by the superconducting film , producing a mode whose dispersion relation is @xmath22 .",
    "we choose a coordinate system where the two plane parallel surfaces separating the superconducting film to the dielectric medium are at @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "propagation takes place along the @xmath25 axis such that all fields can be expressed as @xmath26}$ ] . at this point",
    "we introduce the time dependence @xmath27 to all fields into the basic equations governing the system .",
    "current transport inside the film is described by the first london equation , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the field components parallel and perpendicular to the film surfaces , respectively .",
    "the electromagnetic coupling , given by maxwell s equations , @xmath31 shows that the superconductor dielectric constant is tensorial , @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33    phenomenological theories , such as the present , describe the superconductor only at energies much lower than the pair breaking threshold .",
    "the frequency @xmath14 is much smaller than the frequency defined by the superconducting gap .",
    "consequently the frequency is much smaller than the plasma frequency along the @xmath8 planes , @xmath34 , thus rendering a negative , and large in modulus , dielectric tensor component parallel to the surfaces .",
    "@xmath35 in the present model the c - axis plasma frequency is reached when the dielectric tensor component perpendicular to the surfaces becomes null .",
    "@xmath36 hence @xmath37 changes sign as @xmath14 crosses @xmath0 .    solving maxwell s equations for this particular geometry gives two independent sets of field components , @xmath38 , the transverse electric ( te ) , and @xmath39 , the transverse magnetic ( tm ) propagating modes .",
    "for the tm mode the interfaces superconductor - dielectric acquire superficial charge densities .",
    "curiously anisotropy also implies in a volumetric charge density inside the film , @xmath40 , although it is not responsible for these low frequency propagating modes .",
    "in fact such modes were first observed in nearly isotropic thin granular aluminum films @xcite . in conclusion",
    "the tm mode supports low frequency travelling waves because of the oscillating superficial charge densities that couple the non - conducting dielectric medium to the superconducting film , their ratio given by , @xmath41 the tm field equations are given below , for the dielectric medium , ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 and for the superconducting strip ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath46    in this paper we seek propagating modes that evanesce in the dielectric medium , namely display exponential decay in the dielectric .",
    "this condition is @xmath47 > 0 $ ] , and can be interpreted as demanding a phase velocity , @xmath48 , smaller than the speed of light in the dielectric , @xmath49 . hence above the film ( @xmath50 ) one",
    "gets that , @xmath51 from the other side exponential decay inside the film is not sure to occur because the sign of @xmath52 is not uniquely defined .",
    "this sign determines different physical regimes , and for this reason , we introduce the below and above plasma condition and study their respective @xmath52 regions . hereafter , in order to simplify further discussions , we will choose the nonconducting dielectric medium to have the largest static constant , @xmath53 .",
    "0.5truecm    @xmath54 in this case both @xmath55 and @xmath37 have the same sign . introducing the eq.([cond ] )",
    "approximation , one gets that @xmath56 .",
    "the planes of constant phase are @xmath57 and field amplitudes also evanesce inside the superconductor . @xmath58",
    "0.5truecm    @xmath59 in this case @xmath60 and @xmath61 . even within the eq.([cond ] ) approximation , @xmath62 has no definite sign",
    ". the mode may be evanescent or propagative inside the superconductor .",
    "however the evanescent modes disappear for @xmath53 and then one gets that @xmath63 . in this case",
    "the planes of constant phase are @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , and we fall into the case of confined propagation , with an oblique incidence well defined at the interfaces .",
    "@xmath66 in summary for the present purposes the sign of @xmath52 is uniquely determined below and above @xmath0 by the sign of the ratio @xmath67 .",
    "the dispersion relations follow from the continuity of the ratio @xmath68 at a single interface , say @xmath23 , once assumed that the longitudinal field @xmath69 is either an even or an odd function with respect to the @xmath70 plane .",

    "the discussion of the suitable parameter range is more involving in the present case . according to eq.([tab4 ] )",
    "the function @xmath78 must remain negative for the antisymmetric problem whereas @xmath79 must be positive for the symmetric case .",
    "this restricts the parameter range @xmath80 to the intervals , @xmath81 $ ] for symmetric and @xmath82 $ ] for antisymmetric , where @xmath83 is an integer larger or equal to zero .",
    "our _ exact _ parametrized solutions @xmath22 are ready for applications , just requiring the numerical parameters . before doing so in section [ section4 ]",
    ", we find convenient to describe their physical properties in the next two sections .",
    "in this section we study the properties of propagating modes below @xmath0 .",
    "we find convenient to summarize their major physical properties and introduce some approximated expressions , each describing a different regime of the exact @xmath11 dispersion curve .",
    "we leave to the appendix [ apen ] the proof that the previous section exact results do justify our picture and yield the approximated expressions . below the plasma frequency the field amplitudes inside the film evanesce from the surfaces , and this exponential decay",
    "is characterized by @xmath84 , according to eq.([deftau ] ) .",
    "the choice of film thickness , @xmath19 , is very important in order to assure sufficient coupling between the two surfaces . for extremely thick films the surfaces decouple and the symmetric and the antisymmetric modes are the same , only independent surface plasma modes exist in this situation .",
    "indeed , in case of strong coupling between the two surfaces three distinct regimes are possible for both symmetric and antisymmetric modes . in sequence of increasing @xmath15 we call them _ optical _ ,",
    "_ coupled _ and _ asymptotic _ ( see fig.([fig2 ] ) ) .",
    "close to the origin @xmath85 , the modes are optical , that is , they are essentially plane waves travelling in a dielectric medium .",
    "there is almost no exponential decay in the surrounding dielectric semi - spaces up to appreciable distances , @xmath86 , according to eq.([ex ] ) .",
    "propagation occurs with the speed of light in the dielectric , ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of the superconducting carriers is negligible compared to the magnetic energy of the mode .",
    "the superconducting film contributes very weakly to this regime . in the optical regime",
    "one has , approximately , the linear behavior @xmath88 .    slowly the condensate s kinetic energy increases with @xmath15 until finally both energies become comparable and a first cross - over takes place .",
    "this is the onset of the _ coupled _ regime , a slow mode ( @xmath89 ) , where the condensate s kinetic energy dominates over the magnetic energy , the film and the dielectric are strongly coupled .",
    "this is the true plasma mode regime .",
    "such evanescent propagating modes are known @xcite , here we discuss the effects of a c - axis plasma frequency @xmath0 below the gap@xcite . in the coupled regime inside the film ,",
    "the fields evanesce from the surfaces very smoothly resulting into two types of coupling between the superficial plasmons , which are the antisymmetric and the symmetric modes . for the symmetric mode its dispersion relation",
    "has been theoretically studied by many authors@xcite and experimentally observed@xcite in the past : @xmath90 recently@xcite it has been proposed that the symmetric mode is just the lowest frequency branch . in fact , there is an upper ( antisymmetric ) branch mode , that can also be experimentally observed for highly anisotropic high - tc superconducting films : @xmath91 because the antisymmetric branch is the highest in frequency , it is more sensitive to the effects of the plasma frequency @xmath0 . for @xmath92 comparable ( or smaller ) to @xmath93 , this branch becomes difficult to observe since @xmath94 . for @xmath92 dominant over @xmath93 ,",
    "the symmetric and antisymmetric relations are proportional to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "the cross - over frequency between the optical and the symmetric regime is obtained at the intersection of the two branches : @xmath97 the cross - over between optical and antisymmetric modes is implicitly given by the unique real solution : @xmath98 for the antisymmetric mode , the optical and the coupled frequencies are , respectively , an increasing and a decreasing function of @xmath15 .",
    "thus the cross - over @xmath99 also gives an estimate of the maximum frequency , associated to the peak seen in the antisymmetric curve ( fig.([fig2 ] ) ) .    by increasing @xmath15 , evanescence inside",
    "the superconductor becomes stronger ( @xmath84 is large ) , up to the point where the surfaces are nearly decoupled .",
    "we have just reached the asymptotic regime .",
    "thus for sufficiently high @xmath15 , symmetric and antisymmetric modes converge to the same asymptotic frequency , @xmath100 notice that it is always true that @xmath101 .",
    "it is easy to check in the following extreme cases of a very high dieletric constant ( @xmath102 ) , and of the opposite case , namely , when anisotropy plays a more important role than the dielectric constant , ( @xmath103 ) . in the former case we obtain@xcite @xmath104 , and in the latter @xmath105 . in summary",
    "we have just reviewed the major features of the three possible regimes for both the symmetric and the antisymmetric dispersion relations .",
    "we find that the dielectric constant ratio @xmath106 must be sufficiently high in order to prevent that the @xmath15 range be extremely limited for the _ coupled _ regime . in the next section ( [ section4 ] ) we study such crossovers in case of the high - tc parameter values .",
    "the criterion for the disapperance of the coupled antisymmetric and symmetric regimes is just given by an asymptotic frequency @xmath107 smaller than @xmath108 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "as an example consider the case of an extremely large anisotropy ( @xmath109 ) , where we get that @xmath110 , eventually smaller than the crossover frequencies of eq.([crs ] ) and eq.([cra ] ) . in this limit",
    "the dispersion relation goes almost directly from the optical to the asymptotic regime .",
    "in this section propagating modes inside the superconducting film with the frequency larger than @xmath0 are considered .",
    "we summarize their major physical properties , and leave to the appendix [ apen ] their derivation from the exact parametrized dispersion relation .",
    "we are again interested in modes that evanesce in the dieletric medium . as discussed before",
    ", @xmath111 is always real with the experimental parameter choice of @xmath53 .",
    "the propagation of light inside the film can be understood by a superposition of two dispersive plane waves , @xmath112\\ } } $ ] , regarded as incident and reflected waves , thus with a well defined angle of incidence at the interfaces superconductor - dielectric .",
    "thus while outside the film light is still evanescent , in its interior the propagation can be pictured through ray optics ( see fig.([fig1 ] ) ) , similarly to an optical fiber .    the exact parametrized plasma relation , given by eq.([gapl ] ) and eq.([xapl ] ) , leads to the simple approximated dispersion relation , in the vicinity of @xmath113 , @xmath114 where m is a positive integer , odd for the symmetric modes ( @xmath115 ) and even for the antisymmetric modes ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "this approximated expression was first obtained by artemenko and kobelkov @xcite .",
    "the @xmath117 curve satisfies the evanescence condition , @xmath118 , for @xmath119 .",
    "@xmath120 at the particular value @xmath121 , the wave vector along the x - direction is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is exactly the number of half - wavelength that fit perpendicularly to the film .",
    "for @xmath124 , the relation between @xmath111 and @xmath123 is not so simple because the wave is also in the dielectric medium . in this case",
    "@xmath123 just determines the number of @xmath69 extrema along the x - direction ( see fig.([fig1 ] ) ) .",
    "for instance , when just one half - wavelength fits into the film we are facing the @xmath125 symmetric mode , which has just a single @xmath69 extremum ( maximum ) .",
    "we notice that the frequency of the plasma modes decreases for increasing m. for @xmath126 we have that @xmath127 and the modes are not evanescent , they are plane waves travelling in the dielectric medium .",
    "they have an oblique incidence at the surfaces and to see this just take the plane wave @xmath128\\ } } $ ] with the speed of light in the dielectric , @xmath129 .",
    "one obtains that @xmath130 , showing that we are in a @xmath131 regime not studied here .",
    "the present theory eventually breaks down because large @xmath111 means an infinitesimally small wavelength inside the film along the @xmath132 axis .",
    "for this reason a physical cut - off must be put into this theory , the inter - plane separation @xmath13 . the upper limit @xmath133",
    "is determined when a x - direction half - wavelength fits into the interplane distance @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath134 introducing @xmath135 in the approximated dispersion relation eq.([obap ] ) , gives the lowest frequency plasma mode : @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the josephson penetration depth .",
    "beyond @xmath133 more elaborate models should provide a description of the condensate in such scale .",
    "this can render the theory s usage quite limited , in case the ratio @xmath138 is small , because for very few half - wavelengths inside the film we reach the cut - off limit .",
    "however the applicability of this model above @xmath0 is not restricted to a small ratio @xmath138 because the propagating mode has constant amplitude inside the film , and so , no matter how far apart the surfaces are , there will always be waves reflected at the surfaces . for this reason the major conclusions of this section ,",
    "namely , the existence of slow modes above the plasma frequency , corresponding to dispersive plane waves inside the film , must remain valid even near the cut - off limit .    in the next section",
    "we take the standard parameter values for the high - tc material and discuss the properties of such propagating modes below and above the plasma frequency .",
    "for our applications we choose the following set of parameters for the high - tc ceramic superconductors .",
    "the static dielectric constant @xcite is @xmath139 .",
    "the zero - temperature london penetration length along the @xmath8 planes is @xmath140 @xcite . while the anisotropy , @xmath141 , is @xmath142 for @xmath6@xcite , it has been changing in the past for @xmath143 , ranging from @xmath144 , mainly from torque measurements studies @xcite , to much higher values@xcite .",
    "we show here that choosing the anisotropy between these two values can have important effects on the properties of the dispersion relations for @xmath11 .",
    "there is also the compound @xmath145 compound@xcite with @xmath146 .",
    "fig.([fig1 ] ) provides a pictorial intuitive view of wave propagation in the film below and above the plasma frequency .",
    "below @xmath0 the instantaneous electric field , as well as the component @xmath69 , are shown for both symmetric and antisymmetric fields .",
    "the surface charges are the sole sources of propagating electric fields .",
    "the superficial charge arrangement has strong consequences for the electric field distribuiton inside the film , leading to symmetric and antisymmetric modes , found at distinct frequency ranges , the latter being an upper mode . to understand the effects of anisotropy , or a layered structure , into these modes , where the @xmath8 planes are parallel to the film surface , consider the transverse and longitudinal field and supercurrent components . @xmath147 and @xmath148 are very intense for the antisymmetric mode and nearly zero for the symmetric one , and @xmath69 and @xmath149 , are the dominant components for the symmetric mode but not for the antisymmetric one . thus the relevant penetration depths for the symmetric and the antisymmetric modes must be @xmath17 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the anisotropy @xmath150 hardens the system along the c - axis thus making the antisymmetric mode lower in frequency . above @xmath0",
    "a dispersive plane waves travels inside the film that undergoes total reflection at the interfaces .",
    "this figure also depicts the number of extrema for the electric component @xmath69 , which determines the symmetry of the mode .    in fig.([fig2 ] ) , the symmetric and antisymmetric dispersion relations are shown for a very thin film @xmath151 and the three anisotropies , @xmath152 , @xmath144 and @xmath153 . in order to slow down as much as possible light in the dielectric , and so , lower the coupled regime frequency range , we choose @xmath154 as the exterior non - conducting dielectric medium . at low temperatures its dielectric constant",
    "is known to be high up to the ghz frequency @xcite , @xmath155 .",
    "all curves in this figure were directly obtained from the parametrized solution of eq.([gbpl ] ) and eq.([xbpl ] ) . the symmetric state crossover frequency , @xmath108 , between the optical and the square root regimes",
    "is found to be @xmath156 for the three anisotropies displayed here .",
    "the antisymmetric state crossover frequency , @xmath99 , between the optical and the coupled regime , depends on the anisotropy , being @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 for @xmath152 , @xmath144 and @xmath153 , respectively . because of this anisotropy dependence they are not indicated in this figure .",
    "notice that the symmetric mode ( dashed lines ) is always found at a frequency range lower than its corresponding antisymmetric mode ( continuous lines ) .",
    "in the low wave vector limit , all the dispersions collapse into the same linear ( optical ) regime . in the opposite limit , @xmath15 very large ,",
    "both symmetric and antisymmetric curves converge to the same asymptotic frequency .",
    "this asymptotic frequency is just the surface plasma frequency , strongly affected by anisotropy : @xmath160 for @xmath161 , @xmath162 for @xmath163 and @xmath164 for @xmath141=@xmath153 .",
    "this saturation frequency is independent on film thickness , as expected , according to eq.([omas ] ) .",
    "notice that the wave vector signaling the onset of the asymptotic regime decreases for increasing anisotropy , ranging from @xmath165 for ybco to @xmath166 for the maximum anisotropy considered here .",
    "between the optical and the asymptotic is the coupled regime , the true plasma mode , found to extend over a large range of frequency and wavenumber for an @xmath161 thin film , according to this figure . in this regime",
    "the symmetric plasma mode follows a square root and the antisymmetric mode clearly shows the inverse square root dependence . for @xmath167 , the coupled regime is shorter than in @xmath161 , ranging between @xmath168 to @xmath169 . for the maximum anisotropy of @xmath153 ,",
    "the coupled regime disappears thus only surviving the optical and the asymptotic regimes .",
    "we conclude that an extremely large anisotropy inhibits coupling between the two surfaces and enhances the surface plasma modes .",
    "fig.([fig3 ] ) , directly obtained from eq.([omas ] ) , shows the asymptotic frequency versus @xmath18 , for several anisotropies .",
    "notice that the asymptotic frequency for small @xmath18 is just @xmath0 . for @xmath161 ,",
    "the asymptotic frequency drops over an order of magnitude when @xmath18 changes by three decades . the choice of a non - conducting medium of small dielectric constant can render impossible the observation of these plasma modes because the asymptotic frequency becomes larger than the superconducting gap . in @xmath167 , and other extremely anisotropy compounds , the asymptotic regime is always much smaller than the gap . as @xmath18 increases , we have determined the crossover value , @xmath170 , where the assymptotic frequency acquires a @xmath18 dependence , thus being strongly affected by anisotropy . hence in order that the inverse square - root dependence of the antisymmetric coupled regime be observable , the condition @xmath171 must be satisfied .",
    "fig.([fig4 ] ) shows the dispersion relations above @xmath0 for a @xmath172-thick film .",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath18 is taken equal to @xmath20 .",
    "we have chosen a @xmath167 compound with an anisotropy @xmath141 = @xmath144 .",
    "therefore the c - axis plasma frequency is much smaller than the superconducting gap@xcite .",
    "the curves were directly obtained from eq.([gapl ] ) and eq.([xapl ] ) . above @xmath0 , plasma modes branch into a large number of modes when film thickness increases . for the choice of a @xmath172-thick film ,",
    "the present london - maxwell theory remains valid for the first 66 modes .",
    "we plot in this figure the @xmath173 and @xmath174 dispersion relations . for increasing @xmath123",
    "the plasma mode becomes slower , indicating that the number of reflections that the confined plane wave undergoes at the interfaces has also increased .",
    "notice that the @xmath175 plasma mode is very near @xmath0 .",
    "the m=1 branch is very near to the optical branch showing that it essentially has the speed of light in the dielectric medium .",
    "in this paper we have studied propagating plasma modes in a superconducting film surrounded by two identical dielectric media .",
    "the superconductor is anisotropic having its uniaxial direction ( c - axis ) perpendicular to the interfaces with the dielectric medium .",
    "we consider the existence of a plasma frequency along the uniaxial direction below the gap and study its effects into the propagating modes using the london - maxwell theory , which gives a good account of the physical situation for scales larger than the interplane separation .",
    "in fact we do use the interplane separation as a cut - off for the present theory .",
    "we only consider low incident frequency compare to the superconducting gap frequency .",
    "moreover the wavelength associated to the incident wave is much larger than london s penetration length along the surfaces .",
    "therefore the dielectric constant of the superconducting film along the plane is always negative and with a large modulus . along the c - axis",
    ", the situation is quite distinct .",
    "the dielectric constant of the superconducting film along this direction vanishes at the plasma frequency , being positive above . in this paper",
    "we were only concerned about modes that propagate parallel to the surfaces and evanesce in the dielectric medium . under this condition , and the requirement of the non - conducting medium dielectric constant larger than the superconductor s static constant",
    ", we find that modes are either totally above the plasma frequency , or below , thus never crossing the plasma frequency line .",
    "thus we study these two regions of frequency separately . within our london - maxwell theory framework",
    "we find the _ exact _",
    "expressions for the dispersion relations of the plasma modes in the two cases .",
    "the exact expressions are found in parametric form , the parameter being the one that characterizes the exponential behavior inside the superconductor .",
    "approximated expressions for some especial regimes of the dispersion relations are obtained from our exact parametric solution . in this way we retrieve well - known results in the literature@xcite to the context of an anisotropic film with a plasma frequency inside , and",
    "also , derive new ones .",
    "we find that propagating modes below and above the plasma frequency have quite distinct physical properties .",
    "below the plasma frequency , the amplitude also evanesce inside the superconductor , the film thickness is important in order to assure a sufficiently strong coupling between the surfaces .",
    "there are two branches of the dispersion relation corresponding to the two possible arrangements of the superficial charge densities .",
    "the symmetric branch is the lowest in frequency and has the two superficial charge density symmetrically disposed .",
    "the highest branch has opposite charge facing each other at the interfaces thus being antisymmetric .",
    "we have studied here in details the three possible regimes that can exist for these two branches , their cross - over , and the conditions for the existence of the coupled regime , the most interesting of the three regimes . in the",
    "so - called coupled regime both symmetric and antisymmetric dispersion relation branch provides independent information on the two london penetration lengths . the antisymmetric mode is intimately connected to the transverse current component , thus being highly sensitive to the transverse london penetration length , in the same fashion that the symmetric mode depends on the longitudinal london penetration length .",
    "we believe that this remarkable property can be used to gain further understanding of the transverse current component in anisotropic and layered films .    above the plasma frequency",
    "the amplitudes do not evanesce inside the film , propagation is geometrically understood , and an oblique ray can represent the plane wave inside the superconductor which is totally reflected at the interfaces ( see fig.([fig1 ] ) ) . however outside the film , in the dielectric medium , the wave remains evanescent , and we conclude that above the plasma frequency the superconducting film displays confined propagation , similar to an optic fiber .",
    "notice that the film thickness is not a crucial parameter because no matter how apart the surfaces are , there will always be plane waves travelling in its interior .",
    "contrary to below the plasma frequency , above there are many modes corresponding essentially to the number of half - wavelengths that fit inside the film along the c - axis .    in summary we have shown in this paper that superconducting films surrounded by a dielectric medium displays very interesting plasma modes propagation properties at frequencies below the gap frequency and such properties are quite distinct below and above the c - axis plasma frequency .    this work was done under a cnrs(france)-cnpq(brasil ) collabotation program .",
    "in this appendix we provide further details on how the exact parametrized solutions of section [ section3 ] leads the the pictures developed in sections [ section2 ] and section [ section3 ] for below and above the plasma frequency , respectively .",
    "the three possible regimes , optical coupled and assymptotic follow from the exact parametrized solution . in particular",
    "we show that eq.([eqs ] ) and eq.([eqa ] ) , for the coupled regime , and eq.([omas ] ) , for the asymptotic regime , follow from the eq.([gbpl ] ) and eq.([xbpl ] ) .",
    "we derive both eq.([eqs ] ) and eq.([eqa ] ) within the following approximations : _",
    "( i ) _ retardation effects are neglected ( @xmath177 ) ( @xmath178 ) ; _ ( ii ) _ fields evanesce slowly inside the film , @xmath179 .",
    "therefore the eq.([tab3 ] ) dispersion relations become @xmath180 and @xmath181 for the symmetric and for the antisymmetric modes , respectively ; and _ ( iii ) _ the film thickness is much smaller than the london penetration length along the surfaces @xmath182 so that even though @xmath183 is small we can approximate eq.([eqt ] ) by @xmath184 .",
    "direct elimination of the parameter @xmath183 leads to both eq.([eqs ] ) and eq.([eqa ] ) . in the asymptotic regime fields inside the superconductor",
    "fade away very quickly from the surfaces , thus corresponding to @xmath185 .",
    "the surface decoupling is seen from the antisymmetric and symmetric dispersion relations which converge to the same asymptotic frequency @xmath107 . according to eq.([gbpl ] ) @xmath186 and eq.([omas ] ) follows in a straighforward way from this argument .        to derive eq.([obap ] ) from the exact parametrized solution",
    "is in fact very simple , because it does not demand a detailed study of the @xmath188 curve .",
    "to do so we reparametrize the exact solution of eq.([gapl ] ) , replacing @xmath189 by a new parameter @xmath190 , @xmath191 where @xmath192 , and @xmath193 .",
    "the advantages are two - fold : both symmetric and antisymmetric modes are now defined in the same interval @xmath194 ; and the approximation is under control , corresponding to the limit @xmath195 . notice that at @xmath196 all curves satisfy the condition @xmath197 , thus justifying our claim that eq.([obap ] ) is a good approximation for the exact parametrized dispersion relation of eq.([gapl ] ) and eq.([xapl ] ) when the phase velocity is approximately given by the speed of light in the dielectric . indeed to obtain eq.([obap ] ) from eq.([gapl ] ) and eq.([xapl ] ) , notice that @xmath198 can be taylor expanded in powers of @xmath190 because the functions @xmath199 , introduced in section [ section3 ] , are well behaved in this neighborhood : @xmath200 .",
    "we introduce the approximation @xmath195 into eq.([xapl ] ) obtaining that @xmath201\\}$ ] .",
    "the key issue here is that all the parametric dependence of @xmath202 is now on @xmath131 , because the last term was approximated by a constant , @xmath203 .",
    "therefore we obtain the approximated parametrized dispersion relation , @xmath204 from where the family of curves @xmath22 of eq.([obap ] ) follow , by suitably removing the function @xmath205 .",
    "finally we would like to get some more detailed information about the parametrized exact solution , in particular the two following issues:_(i ) _",
    "@xmath22 is always an increasing function of @xmath15 ; _ ( ii ) _ near @xmath0 it suffices to consider the positive root of eq.([gapl ] ) because the positive and negative roots of eq.([gapl ] ) are just parts of the same curve and meet where the square root vanishes .",
    "the claims are of general validity but we derive them under some further working assumptions on eq.([gapl ] ) , that in leading order , acquires a very simple form , @xmath206 to have the condition @xmath207 satisfied one must choose a dielectric medium of sufficiently high constant : @xmath208 . to have at least one mode described by the above inequality , one must require that the minimal frequency satisfies the inequality : @xmath209 , which is @xmath210 . to show that the curve never saturates , take @xmath196 , where one finds that @xmath211 and @xmath212 for the positive and negative roots , respectively .",
    "obviously the positive root is the low frequency part of the curve .",
    "notice that the negative root is not physical because for @xmath212 @xmath213 is negative according to eq.([xapl ] ) . this just means that the negative square root curve must end at a finite non - zero @xmath131 , where the denominator of eq.([xapl ] ) vanishes and so @xmath202 diverges .",
    "@xmath131 is limited between zero and one , so it must also be finite at this point .",
    "consequently @xmath14 must also diverge , and so , we conclude from this that the curve never saturates in @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
