    "galaxy morphology in different wave - bands provides useful information on the nature of galaxy evolution as well as the overall distribution of galaxy constituents such as old red giants , young luminous stars , gas , dust etc .",
    "for example , the younger population i stars associated with massive gas - rich star formation regions light up the disk galaxies in optical wavelengths .",
    "the distribution of older population ii stars , the dominant matter component near the central regions of galaxies , remains hidden .",
    "the presence of interstellar dust hides the old stellar population especially in late - type disk galaxies .",
    "the nir light , on the other hand , is much less affected by the interstellar dust and more sensitive to the older populations .",
    "thus it provides a penetrating view of the core regions in disk galaxies . therefore careful analysis of morphological differences between the optical and infrared images would not only provide valuable insight into the role of population classes in morphology but also reveal whether the discrepancies are due to singular or combined effects of extinction and population differences ( jarrett et al .",

    "we use a set of measures known as the minkowski functionals ( hereafter mfs , minkowski 1903 ) to analyze the morphology of nir galaxies .",

    "2000 ; jarrett et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we have described and tested the set of minkowski parameters derived from the two - dimensional scalar , vector and several tensor mfs to quantify galaxy shapes for a small sample of 2mass images in paper i. the analyses in paper i used contour smoothing to reduce the effect of background noise .",
    "we have used the same technique in the present sample which contains nir galaxies over the entire range of hubble types including ellipticals , lenticulars and spirals .",
    "the present investigation is aimed at obtaining structural information on 2mass galaxies by measuring their shapes quantified by ellipticity and orientation . as dusty regions of galaxies",
    "become transparent in the nir , the imaging in this part of the spectrum should provide a clear view of the central core / bulge regions of these objects .",
    "a systematic study of nir images should provide valuable information regarding the central structures of galaxies ( e. g. , optically hidden bar ) which would otherwise remain absent when viewed in optical wavelengths .",
    "if only the old red giants illuminate galaxies at nir wavelengths and are decoupled from population i star lights , then the nir galaxies should show weak isophotal twist in their orientations compared to those in the visual wavelengths",
    ". therefore it would be interesting to check whether or not isophotal twist is a wavelength dependent effect .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : the 2mass sample and selection criteria are described in @xmath8 , a brief discussion of the parameters is given in @xmath9 .",
    "we discuss the robustness of the measures to identify and discern galaxy isophotes of various shapes and present our results @xmath10 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in @xmath11 . in the appendix ( @xmath12 )",
    "we demonstrate the sensitivity of several minkowski measures to image contamination by foreground stars .",

    "the 2mass images have 1@xmath19 pixel resolution and @xmath20 beam resolution .",
    "the seeing fwhm values for these images are typically between @xmath21 and @xmath22 in all three bands . for details of the 2mass observations , data reduction and analysis ,",

    "( 2000 , 2003 ) .",
    "our sample contains 112 galaxies imaged in nir @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 bands .",
    "it includes 32 elliptical , 16 lenticulars , and 64 spirals acquired from the 2mass extended source catalogue ( xsc ; jarrett et al .",
    "the spiral sample contains 19 normal ( sa ) , 21 transitional ( sab ) , and 24 barred ( sb ) galaxies .",
    "the galaxy types are taken from the rc3 catalogue ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the sensitivity and resolution ( @xmath23 ) of the nir data obtained in the 2mass is not adequate to derive independent galaxy sub - classification ( jarrett 2000 ) , therefore , we rely on the morphological classification based upon optical data derived in combination with both imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "we construct the sample by hand with a moderately large number of galaxies of each type to make statistical inferences .",
    "the primary motivation behind constructing the sample is to make a comparative analysis with previous results and to investigate the galaxies with new tools to gain further insight into overall galaxy morphology in infrared wave - bands .",
    "we consider only bright galaxies in three different bands ; the @xmath3 band total magnitude for the galaxies is @xmath24 .",
    "spiral galaxies with inclination up to @xmath25 are included in the sample .",
    "no deprojection has been made to any of these galaxies prior to the analysis since the projection effect does not pose a serious threat to the reliability of the analysis when using a parameter such as ellipticity in the structural analysis of low inclination spiral galaxies ( martin 1995 ; abraham et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "all galaxies in our sample are flat fielded and background subtracted . except for three ellipticals , foreground stars have been removed from the rest of the sample .",
    "those galaxies where a foreground star is left embedded in images are included purposely to illustrate the sensitivity of the morphological measures , as explained in the appendix .",
    "for an object with arbitrary shape a complete morphological description requires both topological and geometrical characteristics . the mfs consist of a set of measures carrying both geometric ( e. g. , area , perimeter ) and topological ( the euler characteristic , ec ) information about an object .",
    "the functionals obey a set of properties such as motion invariance , additivity and continuity ( see schmalzing 1999 ; beisbart 2000 ) .",
    "for this study we derive morphological parameters using a selection of two - dimensional scalar , vector , and tensor mfs as described in paper i.    we treat every image as a set of contour lines corresponding to a set of surface brightness levels .",
    "a contour is constructed by linear interpolation at a given level . for every contour ,",
    "the first step of the functional analysis provides three scalars : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and ec ( also represented by the symbol , @xmath28 ) ; three vectors or centroids : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ; and a total of nine components of three symmetric tensors @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 ( for details see paper 1 ) . in the next step ,",
    "the eigenvalues ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; @xmath38 ) of the tensors are found taking centroids as the origins of corresponding tensors . after calculating the eigenvalues",
    ", we proceed to construct the axes and orientations of the `` auxiliary ellipse '' ( hereafter ae ) . to construct the area tensor ae , for example , we take the eigenvalues of @xmath32 and ask what possible ellipse may have exactly the same tensor . when we find that particular ellipse , we label it as the area tensor ae .",
    "the orientation of the semi - major axis of the ae with respect to the positive x - axis is taken as its orientation .",
    "the aes corresponding to the perimeter and ec tensors are constructed in a similar manner . to discern morphologically different objects , therefore ,",
    "we use ellipticities ( @xmath39 ) and orientations ( @xmath40 ) of the aes rather than the eigenvalues of the tensors .",
    "we define ellipticity of the aes as @xmath41 where @xmath42 corresponds to one of the three tensors , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes of the aes .",
    "the use of aes effectively relates a contour to an ellipse : the similarity of three aes is a strong evidence that the shape of the contour is elliptical .",
    "for example , in case of a perfect elliptic contour , the aes will be the same .",
    "in particular , the areas of all three aes will be equal to the area of the contour , i. e. , @xmath45 , and the perimeters of the ellipses will be equal to the perimeter of the contour , i. e. , @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , the orientations of all three ellipses will coincide with the orientation of the contour .",
    "therefore , if plotted , all three aes will be on top of each other , overlapping with the contour .",
    "for that contour , all three vector centroids will also coincide with each other and with the center of the contour .",
    "note that the latter alone does not guarantee that the contour itself is elliptical in nature since for any centrally symmetric contour the centroids would coincide .",
    "however , for a non - elliptical contour all three aes will be different in size and orientation ( see fig . 1 , paper i ) .",
    "note that the sets of eigenvalues from three tensors can be used to construct three `` anisotropy '' parameters instead of three aes ( see also beisbart 2000 ) .",
    "the parameters can be defined as @xmath47 where @xmath42 has the same meaning as before . to better understand the behaviors of @xmath39 and @xmath48 , we show these parameters in fig . [ scaling ] as functions of contour area ( @xmath26 ) for four elliptic profiles of different flattening .",
    "panel 1 of the figure shows ellipticity for all four profiles .",
    "panels 2 , 3 , and 4 show , respectively , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 where each of these panels also has four profiles . for each profile , we find that the @xmath39 of the aes are identical and coincide with each other ( panel 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath48 , on the other hand , do not coincide even for perfect elliptic contours ( panels 2 , 3 , and 4 ) .",
    "we also find that the relative separations between different @xmath48 change with the flattening of the contours . from the behavior of the parameters one can think that the @xmath39 of the aes act as parameters that are scaled with respect to the @xmath48 . for contours with arbitrary flattening",
    ", the @xmath48 from the area and ec tensors need to scale down to match with the @xmath39 of the respective aes .",
    "the @xmath52 from the perimeter tensor , however , needs to scale up for spherical and moderately elongated contours . for highly elongated contours , however , all three @xmath52s need to scale down .",
    "the illustration of the `` anisotropy '' parameter serves two purposes .",
    "first , it gives us a feeling of the aes compared to the conventional parameter that deals with eigenvalues .",
    "second , it demonstrates that one can derive various shape measures from the set of mfs .",
    "apart from this parameter , one can also derive the shapefinder statistic as suggested by sahni , sathyaprakash & shandarin ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , we restrict ourselves to ellipticity and orientation since these are the two widely used measures in astronomy",
    ". we will explore the sensitivity and robustness of @xmath48 in our future work on optical galaxies .",
    "the non - parametric approach for shape analysis , such as moments technique , has been known to the astronomical community for some time ( carter 1978 ; carter & metcalf 1980 ) .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the morphological analyses based only on the moments of inertia would provide incomplete and sometimes misleading results . as an example , let us assume that one has a galaxy image which has been kept in a black box and analyzed using simply the inertia tensor without having a priori knowledge of the shape of the image .",
    "the analysis based only on the moments of inertia will provide a resultant ellipticity of the object regardless of its actual shape . using this result",
    "one can always infer an elliptical shape for the unseen object .",
    "if one raises the question of the likeliness of the elliptical shape of the object , the analysis based on the inertia tensor alone will not be able to give a satisfactory answer .",
    "one needs to invoke additional measure(s ) in order to justify the result .",
    "it is at this point where the measures derived from the set of mfs appear to be effective .",
    "subsequent analyses of the image using moments of the perimeter and ec tensor enables one to pin down the type of the galaxy and thus ensures the objectivity of the analysis .",
    "the ellipticities obtained from different aes provide information ( regarding shapes ) similar to the conventional shape measure based on inertia tensor .",
    "the main difference is that the conventional method finds the eigenvalue of the inertia tensor for an annular region enclosing mass density or surface brightness .",
    "the method based on mfs , however , finds the eigenvalues of contour(s ) where the region enclosed by the contour(s ) is assumed to be homogeneous and to have constant surface density .    in order to reduce the effect of noise present in the image we use a simple smoothing technique . instead of smoothing the whole image , we smooth contours at each brightness level using the procedure known as the unequally weighted moving average method .",
    "the goal of this smoothing is to restore the initial unperturbed contour as much as possible and measure its morphological properties .",
    "the implementation of the smoothing is described in detail in paper i.    contour smoothing considerably improves the estimates of ellipticity derived from the tensor functionals ( see figs . 8 and 9 ,",
    "paper i ) , therefore , in this study , we focus on the results obtained only from the smoothed contours .",
    "however , we note two effects that arise as a result of smoothing",
    ". first , in the outer regions of galaxies a smoothed , outer contour crosses the inner one .",
    "it happens occasionally ; however , the area within the smoothed , outer contour remains greater than the inner one and does not affect the measurement .",
    "second , in case of very large contour , we loose information .",
    "the smoothing technique is an iterative process depending on the number of points along a contour ( see paper 1 for details ) .",
    "a highly irregular contour that consists of large number of points eventually shrinks to a point due to excessive smoothing . as a result",
    "we do not get any contribution from it .",
    "however , this does not pose any threat on getting relevant information of the shape of image contours since we can always compare with the unsmoothed profiles to see how much information is lost .",
    "in this paper we use a different notation to express ellipticity than in paper i where we used @xmath53 in the range 0 to 10 . the symbol @xmath54 for the ellipticity parameter is often used for",
    "the definition of the hubble types for ellipticals and this symbol and range can be misleading when used as a parameter for other types of galaxies ( e. g. , spirals ) .",
    "we , therefore , use @xmath39 as the characteristic of shape with the range 0 to 1 .    the ellipticity and orientation can be used to isolate galaxies into two broad bins : non - barred and barred systems . for finer distinction",
    "we need to use other parameters such as luminosity , color , surface brightness , half - light radius , etc .",
    "both of these parameters have been applied to quantify properties of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. carter 1978 ; williams & schwarzschild 1979 ; leach 1981 , lauer 1985 ; jedrzejewski 1987 ; fasano & bonoli 1989 ; franx , illingworth & heckman 1989 ; peletier et al .",
    "in many recent works this set of parameters has been used to obtain information on different structural components , e. g. , bar , bulge , disk etc . of disk galaxies ( athanassoula et al .",
    "1990 ; martin 1995 ; wozniak et al .",
    "1995 ; rozas , knapen & beckman 1998 ; abraham & merrifield 2000 ; laurikainen , salo & rautainen 2002 ; peng et al .",
    "2002 , erwin & sparke 1999 ; erwin & sparke 2003 ; michel - dansac & wozniak 2004 ) .",
    "galaxies with different morphologies appear to show characteristic signatures in the ellipticity profile .",
    "for example , the profile of elliptical galaxies is generally monotonic .",
    "a barred galaxy , however , shows a distinct peak with a spherical central region , signaling the presence of a central bulge and a bar . on the other hand , for a multi - barred system",
    "several peaks appear in the profile ( wozniak et al . 1995 ; erwin & sparke 1999 ) .",
    "elliptical galaxies usually show twists ( i. e. , a change in the orientation of ae ) in the orientation profiles with varied strength depending on the flattening of the contours .",
    "barred galaxies , on the other hand , not only have large twists in their orientations but also have characteristic features such as a sharp peak , or two different but approximately constant orientations with an abrupt change in between ( wozniak et al . 1995 ; erwin & sparke 1999 ) .    in the contemporary studies , therefore , a barred galaxy is identified as the system whose ellipticity and orientation profile simultaneously show the distinctive signatures mention above . in this study",
    "we follow the same criterion to analyze disk galaxies , i. e. , we identify bars by visual inspection with the condition that both ellipticity and orientation profiles show the characteristic features simultaneously .",
    "however , identifying disk galaxies as barred systems with the above criterion ( as used in previous studies mostly in optical wavelengths ) should be used with caution .",
    "our experience shows that optically classified barred galaxies appear with distinct peaks in their ellipticity profiles but show continuous orientation over the region where the peak in the shape profiles persists .",
    "therefore we feel that more elaborate treatment is needed for identifying barred systems rather than simply relying on the behaviors of ellipticity and orientation . in this study , therefore , when we encounter these types of systems , we refrain from drawing any conclusions about these galaxies .",
    "we will explore the detailed shape properties of these galaxies in our future study including other structural measures such as fourier decomposition technique ( quillen , frogel & gonzalez 1994 ; buta & block 2001 ) .",
    "we measure ellipticity and orientation for a set of contours obtained at different surface brightness levels .",
    "generally these two parameters vary with the area of the contour , i. e. , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we analyze each galaxy at 30 different brightness levels where the levels correspond to equally spaced areas on a logarithmic scale covering almost the entire region of each galaxy . at every brightness level , contours are found and subsequently smoothed .",
    "all three aes are constructed from the smoothed contours . in order to reduce information content",
    "we present our final results using only the area tensor ae and hence drop the subscript @xmath42 .",
    "below we briefly discuss the justification of the choice . for each galaxy , therefore , we show @xmath4 and @xmath5 of this particular ae as a function of contour area ( @xmath26 ) .    for each galaxy ,",
    "a thick dashed line is used to show the mean values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 calculated from @xmath7 and @xmath3 bands .",
    "the mean values are used to estimate the overall change ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) which is defined as the difference between the highest and lowest value of the corresponding mean value .",
    "it is a single number and independent of @xmath26 .",
    "two thin solid lines are used to show the maximum and minimum of the measures obtained from different bands .",
    "the difference between these two thin solid lines is used to quantify the scatter ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) in the parameters .",
    "the @xmath61 varies at different regions of a galaxy and so depends on @xmath26 .",
    "we use it as an indicator to measure the dependence of galaxy shapes on different colors .    for each sample of galaxies ,",
    "the result is presented in increasing order of 2mass ellipticity obtained from the 2mass catalogue .",
    "the 2mass ellipticity and orientation are measured for the @xmath62 isophote in the @xmath3 band ( @xmath63 is the rms amplitude of the background noise provided by the catalogue ) . for each galaxy , the 2mass shape parameter is , therefore , a single number .",
    "our analysis , on the other hand , provides a range of values obtained at different regions ( recall that @xmath4 or @xmath5 is a function of area ) from the galactic center .",
    "we use the 2mass estimate of ellipticity and position angle as the reference .",
    "it is shown by the horizontal dashed line . in all plots the vertical dashed line represents the contour area ( @xmath26 ) corresponding to @xmath3 band @xmath62 isophote .",
    "we rescale the orientation profiles of a few galaxies to fit the desired ranges that have been chosen to show the @xmath5 profiles .",
    "note that our results presented below correspond to the area @xmath64 . the range is chosen in order to exclude discreteness effects due to the grid .",
    "the deviation ( @xmath65 ) as well as the scatter ( @xmath61 ) in the parameters , therefore , will be considered in this range .      from section @xmath66 we know that for a perfect elliptic contour , the areas enclosed by the aes will be the same whereas for non - elliptic contours they will be different",
    ". therefore , comparing the areas enclosed by different ellipses one can probe to which extent the shape of a contour can be approximated by an ellipse .",
    "galaxies appear more regular in nir wave bands than in the visual wavelengths .",
    "for example , a galaxy may appear grand in the visual bands with its giant spiral arms .",
    "however , it will lose much of its grandeur in infrared wave - bands .",
    "since spiral arms consist mostly of gas and young bright stars , they will be absent in long wavelength parts of the spectrum . to see up to",
    "what extent galaxy contours of different hubble types retain their characteristic signatures in nir and how tensor ellipses help us to understand their shapes , we draw readers attention to figs .",
    "[ aa_1 ] and [ aa_2 ] . in these figures",
    "we show the relative difference in areas enclosed by three different aes as a function of contour area ( @xmath26 ) for a selection of elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "the figures highlight only the interesting parts along the vertical axis .",
    "each panel contains a total of nine curves : three curves corresponding to three aes from each band .",
    "the dark , medium and light colors represent , respectively , the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 band .",
    "we show the area , perimeter , and ec ellipses , respectively , by the solid , dotted , and dashed - dotted lines .    apart from three galaxies that are marked by `` s '' , the isophotal contours of most of the galaxies in fig .",
    "[ aa_1 ] show elliptic nature in the nir .",
    "few of these , e. g. , ngc 3158 and ngc 2778 ( galaxy number 8 and 15 respectively ) appear slightly non - elliptic in one or two bands .",
    "the galaxies marked by `` s '' ( number 1 , 4 , and 7 ) are galaxies which have foreground stars embedded in their image . for these galaxies",
    "the notable feature is the sharp increase in area around the region of the images where the star is embedded .",
    "one can see that the same ellipse overlaps in different bands .",
    "this is most notable from the ec ellipse ( dashed - dotted line ) since the ec tensor is the most sensitive to any disturbance along the contour .",
    "the other two ellipses also behave in a similar manner but with less sensitivity .",
    "this particular behavior shows that the aes detect unusual features attached to otherwise perfectly elliptical image body .",
    "for example , when we compare ngc 3158 or ngc 2778 with those three galaxies , we notice that @xmath67 not only differs in different bands but it also spreads out differently around the edge .",
    "it tells us that the contours of these galaxies are simply non - elliptic around the edge without any abnormal feature .    when we compare galaxies of different hubble types , we find that almost all spiral galaxies ( fig . [ aa_2 ] ) show more non - elliptic nature than the elliptical galaxies",
    ". the non - elliptic nature of spiral galaxy isophotes is reflected strongly in the behavior of the ec ellipse in all bands . for these galaxies ,",
    "the ec ellipse is different not only from other two ellipses but it is also spread out arbitrarily in different bands .    from figs .",
    "[ aa_1 ] and [ aa_2 ] , it is clear that all three aes are useful for better characterization of a galaxy image .",
    "the information provided by the aes definitely help to get finer distinction of galaxies . since our current interest is to focus on the gross morphological features rather than looking at the finer details of galaxy isophotes , to reduce the information content , therefore , we will only use the area tensor ae to present our final results .",
    "the sample of elliptical galaxies has been divided into two groups .",
    "group 1 contains galaxies with small ellipticities ( @xmath68 ) while group 2 has galaxies with @xmath6 . to simply locate a galaxy within a group , we label them with an integer number .",
    "for example , ngc 4374(2 ) means that ngc 4374 is the second galaxy in its relevant group . in each group galaxy number 1",
    "has the lowest 2mass ellipticity whereas number 16 has the highest value .",
    "we follow the same format for all types of galaxies .",
    "note that below we highlight only those galaxies that have interesting / unusual morphological features .",
    "the general trends of galaxies will be investigated in @xmath11 .",

    "ngc 4374(2 ) and ngc 4261(9 ) , have uncommon profiles compared to other galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are more elongated in the region @xmath69 than either around the center or near the edge which makes their profiles look `` centrally arched '' ( marked by `` a '' ) .",
    "this particular type of behavior is shown only by sphericals and is absent in elongated galaxies .",

    "[ ellpe1 ] : ngc 4278(1 ) , ngc 3193(4 ) , and ngc 3379(7 ) .",
    "these galaxies have sharp kinks in the @xmath4 profiles .",
    "these sharp changes are caused by a foreground star and do not correspond to any structural feature ( see appendix ) .",
    "the rest of the galaxies show profiles typical of ellipticals .",
    "galaxies in this group , in general , have small scatter .    * orientation : * the orientation profiles of galaxies are presented in fig .",

    "ngc 4458(3 ) is stable from the center up to @xmath70 and shows a large deviation near the edge .",
    "ngc 3193(4 ) shows a notable peak in its orientation .",
    "its profile shows a dip around the region where the foreground star is embedded .",
    "ngc 3379(7 ) does not show any unusual feature in its profile .",
    "its position angle , as well as the scatter , gradually increases towards the galactic center .",
    "ngc 3379(7 ) has larger scatter at all distances from the galactic center than ngc 4278(1 ) and ngc 3193(4 ) .",
    "note that the presence of a star on the galaxy contours may or may not be detected by the @xmath5 profile . the @xmath4 profile , on the other hand , is sensitive to any kind of disturbance on the contour .",
    "if the unusual feature on the contour attributed by the star happens to be along the major axis , which is the case for ngc 3379(7 ) , it remains unnoticed and no peak appears in the @xmath5 profile .",
    "this is the reason why the presence of a star on the contours may be missed as a signature on the @xmath5 profile . on the other hand ,",
    "if the feature is slightly off the major axis , it changes the orientation of the contour significantly with respect to the inner and outer contours .",
    "this is the case for ngc 4278(1 ) and ngc 3193(4 ) .    in spite of being a spherical galaxy ( e1 + ) , ngc 4494(6 )",
    "has remarkably low twist ( @xmath71 ) and scatter in its orientation .",
    "it is very unusual because a spherical contour is highly susceptible to background noise .",
    "a slight perturbation caused by the noise distorts the contour s shape and the direction of perturbation becomes its orientation .",
    "vcc 1737(10 ) , ngc 3159(12 ) , and ngc 3226(13 ) have orientation profiles quite similar to disk galaxies as shown later in this section .",

    "we also discuss the sensitivity of the parameters to any disturbance present on the contour .    in order to emphasize the role of contour smoothing we show in fig .",
    "[ ellp_all_e1_unsm ] the ellipticity measured from all three aes , both for unsmoothed and smoothed elliptical galaxies in group 1 . in this figure",
    "the dark , medium , and light colors are used to represent the @xmath7 and @xmath3 band respectively .",
    "the solid , dashed , and dashed - dotted lines show the area , perimeter , and ec ellipses for each band . as we can see from the unsmoothed contours in the left panel , the ellipses differ from one another in each band mostly near the edge .",
    "this deviation is caused by the background noise since the galaxy surface brightness distribution is steeper near the center and shallower outward .",
    "we should also note that in a region far away from the center of a galaxy the absolute value of the distribution is very small . in either case",
    "any kind of background noise will have a strong effect on the outer part of the distribution .",
    "therefore when one constructs contours along the edge of a galaxy , they appear highly deviated no matter what their true shapes are .",
    "if the contours were truly elliptical , they could appear in any arbitrary shape depending on the amount distortion .",
    "since the contours are not elliptic anymore , the aes diverge from one another .",
    "this divergence reflects the apparent shape of the contours .",
    "one can see from the right panel that contour smoothing reduces the role of noise significantly .",
    "it helps restore the original shape of the contours . at the same time",
    "one can also notice that the differences among the ellipses reduce substantially .",
    "to demonstrate further , we collect first four galaxies from each group of spiral galaxies and show the ellipticity for both unsmoothed and smoothed contours in figs .",
    "[ ellp_all_spi_unsm ] and [ ellp_all_spi_sm ] , respectively .",
    "the motive , once again , is to reemphasize the role of contour smoothing .    when we compare figs .",
    "[ ellp_all_e1_unsm ] and [ ellp_all_spi_sm ] , it appears that the color difference is , in general , stronger for spiral galaxies and within spirals , it is stronger for certain hubble types .",
    "we see that the galaxies in spiral group 4 , which are mostly late - type , have significant differences in their shapes ( at least what is revealed by the @xmath4 parameter ) when studied in three different nir bands .",
    "we now proceed to check the sensitivity of the minkowski shape measures to detect image contamination by a foreground star .",
    "the @xmath1 band contours of ngc 4278 , ngc 3193 , ngc 3379 ( 1 , 4 , and 7 in elliptical group 1 ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ star_cont ] .",
    "this figure also includes the contours of ngc 5507 ( 5 in elliptical group 2 ) from the same band . note that the presence of a star is apparent in all three bands .",
    "it is most prominent in the @xmath1 band and this why we show the contour plot in this band .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ star_measure ] shows the ellipticity profiles of these galaxies and the right panel shows the relative difference in areas enclosed by three tensor aes . in the left panel we use solid , dashed and dashed - dotted lines represent the measures from area , perimeter and ec aes .",
    "the dotted line is the measure from the scalar functional ae that has not been used in this analysis .",
    "it is included only for the purpose of illustration .",
    "note that the construction of the scalar ellipse is different from the tensor ellipses . since the scalar functionals are simply the area ( @xmath26 ) and perimeter ( @xmath27 ) of a given contour",
    ", the scalar ae is an ellipse that has the same area and perimeter as the contour itself . for a perfect elliptical contour ,",
    "the scalar ae will converge with its tensor counterparts .",
    "the scalar functionals do not have enough information to attribute an orientation to its ellipse .",
    "the right panel does not show any measurement from the scalar functional .    from figs .",
    "[ star_cont ] and [ star_measure ] , we see that a foreground star embedded in an image causes galaxy isophotes to deviate from their original shapes .",
    "it usually adds small , lobe - like features to the otherwise smoothed and spherical contours .",
    "the functionals easily pick up this type of signal present on the contour and translate it to the shape parameters .",
    "this demonstration highlights the fact that mfs based measures can be used for automatic detection of features attached to the image body .",
    "our analysis is further supported by ngc 5077 ( number 5 in elliptical group 2 ) .",
    "this galaxy is interesting for our purpose since it has been archived in the 2mass catalogue as an image free from foreground star .",
    "the contour plot of the galaxy , however , reveals that it is not the case since the isophotal contours are perturbed by an uncommon feature .",
    "apart from the contour plot , the behavior of the ellipticity profile or the plot showing ratios of the sizes of aes also give strong indication of the presence of something unusual in the image body . from the extent of the feature along the radial direction",
    "one can infer the possible nature of the object that distorts the image contours . a close inspection of the contours and a comparison with the other galaxies mentioned above",
    "lead us to conclude that a foreground star is still left embedded in the galaxy image .    with these examples at hand , we feel confident to suggest that both ellipticity and the ratios of the sizes of aes can be used simultaneously as filtering tools in image processing",
    ". these measures may appear useful to reduce the chance of contamination by foreground star while constructing large galaxy catalogues from surveys such as sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ."
