    "the anisotropic formulation of lattice qcd has certain advantages when it comes to the study of the equation of state ( eos ) at various finite temperatures .",
    "the finite temperature field theory has a natural asymmetry which makes the anisotropic approach useful to reduce the lattice spacing errors associated with the transfer matrix at less cost than is required for the full continuum limit@xcite . through the introduction of anisotropy on the lattice",
    "one can make the temporal lattice spacing , @xmath0 , sufficiently small so that by varying only the number of time slices , @xmath1 , the temperature can be changed in small discrete steps .",
    "our simulations of full qcd with two flavors of staggered fermions on anisotropic lattices are aimed at the study of the thermodynamic properties of the quark - gluon system .",
    "we employ a fixed parameter scheme in which all the bare parameters of the simulation are kept constant and only the temperature is changed by varying @xmath1 ( from 4 to 64 ) .",
    "this approach separates temperature and lattice spacing effects and keeps the underlying physics scales fixed .",
    "the calculation of the eos of the quark - gluon system involves derivatives of the bare parameters with respect to the physical anisotropy @xmath2 and the spatial lattice spacing @xmath3 .",
    "these `` karsch '' coefficients@xcite are determined as a by - product of the zero - temperature calculations needed to choose the bare parameters .",
    "once determined , the karsch coefficients can be used for all temperatures since they depend only on the intrinsic lattice parameters and not on @xmath1 .",
    "this allows a straight - forward determination of the temperature dependence of the energy and pressure , again at fixed lattice spacing . with two or more slightly different values for @xmath0 , a high - resolution sampling of temperatures can be investigated .",
    "our calculations are based on the qcd action @xmath4 , where the gauge action is : @xmath5 ,       \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the fermion action is : @xmath6 \\psi(x)\\nonumber\\\\ & & +       \\sum_{x } \\overline{\\psi}(x)\\left [   \\frac{1}{\\xi_0 } \\sum_s \\slash{d}^{\\rm staggered}_s         \\right ]   \\psi(x ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to derive the eos we start from the thermodynamics identities @xmath7 and @xmath8    using the explicit form for @xmath9 and changing the independent variables with respect to which we differentiate to @xmath10 and @xmath3 we get :",
    "in our simulations we use the r - algorithm@xcite implemented for two flavors of dynamical fermions .",
    "the zero - temperature runs from table 1 are used to calculate the derivatives of the bare parameters with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath3 ( the karsch coefficients ) involved in the eos .",
    "the finite temperature runs in table 2 and 3 represent two separate sweeps through the transition region for each of which the fixed bare parameter scheme described above is applied .",
    "figure 1 shows the variation of @xmath11 through the phase transition as we gradually change the temperature by varying only @xmath1 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "figure 2 shows the final result for the eos .",
    "the errors on the pressure are significantly bigger than the errors on the energy due to the large errors on those of the karsch coefficients which are derivatives with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "the comparison with the free lattice theory ( squares ) gives an explanation of the prominent drop off of @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the high temperature sector  simply a consequence of the lattice high momentum cut - off .",
    "our results are consistent with previous isotropic results@xcite .",
    "we have studied the qcd thermodynamics using staggered fermions on anisotropic lattices .",
    "the fixed bare parameter scheme allows us to explore the temperature dependence of energy and pressure with fixed physics scales .",
    "while this approach naturally reduces finite lattice spacing errors associated with @xmath0 , the fixed lattice cut - off becomes important at increasing temperature .",
    "including improvements to the spatial parts of the staggered fermion action would be a natural step to reduce the lattice artifacts for high temperatures .    9 qcd - taro collaboration : ph .",
