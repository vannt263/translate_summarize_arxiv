    "in this paper we present an update of the analysis of double - tag two - photon events : @xmath3 already published for @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite , obtained at lep with the l3 detector .",
    "the data , collected at centre - of - mass energy @xmath6 , correspond to an integrated luminosity of 176  pb@xmath7 .",
    "both scattered electrons are detected in the small angle electromagnetic calorimeters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kin ] ) .",
    "the virtuality of the two photons , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , is in the range of @xmath10 .",
    "the centre - of - mass energy of the two virtual photons , @xmath11 , ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .    _ ]    for @xmath14 ( untagged events )  @xcite , the two - photon cross - section , @xmath15 , is dominated by vector - vector interactions , vdm  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn]a ) .     interactions .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] _ ]    with increasing @xmath16 , the vdm process is suppressed by the vector meson form factor and the quark parton model process  ( qpm ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn]b , becomes important .",
    "single - tag two - photon events , where @xmath17 , are usually analysed within the dis formalism  @xcite and a photon structure function is introduced ( _ resolved photon _ ) . since the highly virtual photon , unlike the proton , does not contain constituent quarks with an unknown density distribution , one may hope to have a complete qcd calculation under particular kinematical conditions . in this formalism , used today by the monte carlo generators , one considers one or two resolved photons ( _ single or double resolved processes _ ) to calculate the qcd leading order diagrams .",
    "an alternative qcd approach is based on the bfkl equation  @xcite . here the highly virtual two - photon process , with @xmath18 , is considered as the `` golden '' process where the calculation can be verified without phenomenological inputs  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 interaction can be seen as the interaction of two @xmath20 pairs scattering off each other via multiple gluon exchange  ( fig .",
    "2c ) . for @xmath21",
    "a diagram with one - gluon exchange could be sufficient and the cross - section would be constant  ( fig .",
    "2d ) . in the limit of high energy , @xmath22 , the diagram of fig .",
    "2c is calculable by the resummation of the large logarithms . in this scheme",
    "the cross - section for the collision of two virtual photons is  @xcite : @xmath23 here @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the beam energy , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the energy and polar angle of the scattered electrons and @xmath28 is the `` hard pomeron '' intercept . the centre - of - mass energy of the two - photon system is related to the @xmath29 centre - of - mass energy @xmath30 by @xmath31 . in leading order",
    "one has @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of colours . using @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath36  @xcite ; in the next - to - leading order the bfkl contribution is calculated to be smaller , @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "double - tag interactions have been measured in previous experiments  @xcite at lower values of @xmath16 and @xmath38 . for comparison with the prediction of the bfkl models",
    ", the cross - sections will be given as a function of the variable @xmath39 instead of @xmath38 as used in ref .",
    "the advantage in using this variable is that @xmath40 is independent of the beam energy : @xmath41 with @xmath42 . + as  @xmath43  and   @xmath44 : + @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the angle between the two photons and @xmath47 are the tagging angles .",
    "the monte carlo generators used in this analysis are jamvg  @xcite which generates events with the matrix element of figure  [ fig : feyn]b and phojet  @xcite which gives a good description of the single - tag events  @xcite and uses the grv - lo  @xcite parton density in the photon to initiate qcd processes .",
    "the dominant backgrounds are @xmath48 , simulated by jamvg  @xcite , and single - tag two - photon hadronic events , where a hadron is misidentified as a scattered electron .",
    "the contamination by annihilation processes is simulated by pythia  @xcite ( @xmath49 ) , koralz  @xcite  ( @xmath50 ) and koralw  @xcite  ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "all monte carlo events are passed through a full detector simulation using the geant  @xcite and the geisha  @xcite programs and are reconstructed in the same way as the data .",
    "a detailed description of the l3 detector is given in ref .",
    "the two - photon hadronic events are mainly triggered by two independent triggers : the central track  @xcite and the single and double tag energy  @xcite triggers .",
    "the total trigger inefficiency of the selected events is less than 1% .    and energy of the scattered electrons .",
    "the data is compared to the monte carlo predictions , normalised to the number of data events there are two entries per event .",
    "[ fig : q2 ] _ , title=\"fig : \" ]  and energy of the scattered electrons .",
    "the data is compared to the monte carlo predictions , normalised to the number of data events there are two entries per event .",
    "[ fig : q2 ] _ , title=\"fig : \" ]    two - photon hadronic event candidates , @xmath3 , are selected using the following cuts :    * there must be two identified electrons , forward and backward  ( double - tag ) , in the small angle electromagnetic calorimeters .",
    "each electron is identified as the highest energy cluster in one of the calorimeters , with energy greater than @xmath52 .",
    "the polar angle of the two tagged electrons has to be in the range @xmath53  mrad and @xmath54  mrad .",
    "* the number of tracks , measured in the polar angle region @xmath55 , must be greater than two .",
    "the tracks are required to have a transverse momentum , @xmath56 , greater than @xmath57 and a distance of closest approach in the transverse plane to the interaction vertex smaller than 10  mm . *",
    "the value of @xmath39 is required to be in the range @xmath58 .",
    "after these cuts , 108 events are selected with an estimated background of 14 events from @xmath48 and misidentified single - tag events .",
    "the contamination from annihilation processes is negligible .    ,  and the variable @xmath40 .",

    "[ fig : ggcro ] we show @xmath59 , after subtraction of the qpm contribution given in table  [ tab : ggcro ] , as a function of @xmath40 . using an average value of @xmath16 , @xmath60 , we calculate the one - gluon exchange contribution with the asymptotic formula  ( eq .  10.2 of ref .",
