    "modeling theoretically the properties of the sources that re - heated and re - ionized the intergalactic medium at the end of the cosmic dark ages is difficult , because , at present , our knowledge of the nature of ionizing sources is highly incomplete . the conventional view , held over a decade since the original work of @xcite , is that the ionization at the highest redshifts is dominated by the uv radiation from star - forming galaxies , and that the non - thermal contribution from quasars builds up only later , at @xmath2 , to dominate the double ionization of helium ( which requires photons of energies exceeding @xmath3 ) .",
    "this conventional view , however , is incomplete . in particular",
    ", it ignores an important physical process of `` secondary ionizations '' by energetic ionizing photons .",
    "it is a well - known physical fact that an ionizing photon with the energy @xmath4 in excess of @xmath5 is capable of ionizing more than a single atom - the excess photon energy of @xmath6 is deposited in the electron , which is capable of ionizing one or more additional atoms in its vicinity @xcite .",
    "these secondary ionizations can substantially increase the relative contribution of quasars to the reionization of the universe .",
    "for example , a @xmath7 x - ray photon can ionize up to @xmath8 hydrogen atoms .",
    "while this important effect has been included in many of the prior work on hydrogen reionization @xcite , it may be worth re - assessing the canonical view of the sub - dominance of the quasar population as the source of hydrogen reionization in light of recent improvements in the values of cosmological parameters and new developments in our understanding of the growth of supermassive black holes at high redshifts .",
    "there are two possible approaches to modeling reionization . in the first one , a model for the emission , propagation , and absorption of ionizing radiation from various categories of sources is constructed .",
    "ultimately , such a model must involve a cosmological numerical simulation that resolves lyman limit systems with sub - kpc resolution and clustering of galaxies and quasars on @xmath9 scales .",
    "such a large uniform dynamic range is not yet feasible in modern cosmological simulations , so this type of modeling inevitably suffers from the unknown systematic biases , but , at the same time , it offers the most complete model of cosmic reionization .    a second , much simpler ( and , therefore , much more limited ) approach consists in ignoring the absorption and propagation of ionizing photons , and restricting a theoretical model to only counting the number of ionizations per atom .",
    "a major ( but not the sole ) limitation of this approach is that the criterion for reionization - the required number of ionizations per atom - is unknown . while reasonable estimates for this number can be constructed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and discussion there ) , it , at the very least , must exceed unity systems . ] .",
    "in this brief paper , we adopt the second , simple approach , to couple theoretical expectations for both stellar sources and quasars , and to consider their relative contribution to the total number of ionizations per hydrogen atom . in line with our limited goals , we restrict our attention only to two main astrophysical types of ionizing sources , although we remain acutely aware that other , more exotic sources - including the energetic photons and electrons from dark matter annihilation - can provide a substantial or even dominant contribution to the total ionization budget ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we evolve the population of two distinct types of seed massive black holes ( mbhs ) : either `` small seeds '' , derived from population iii remnants @xcite , or  large seeds \" , derived from gas - dynamical collapse in metal  free galaxies @xcite .",
    "we adopt one single formation scenario for each realization of the universe we consider , therefore each model contains only `` small seeds '' or `` large seeds '' .    in the population",
    "iii remnants model , seed mbhs form with masses @xmath10 few@xmath11 ( see fig .  1 , top left panel ) , in haloes collapsing at @xmath12 from rare 3.5-@xmath13 peaks of the primordial density field @xcite . in the `` large seeds '' scenario , massive seeds with @xmath14 can form at high redshift , when the intergalactic medium has not been significantly enriched by metals . here",
    "we refer to @xcite , for more details of the physical mbh formation model .",
    "seeds form in gravitationally unstable pre - galactic disk with primordial composition , in halos with virial temperature @xmath15 k , cooled mainly by atomic hydrogen .",
    "the stability of gaseous disks depends on two parameters , the halo spin parameter @xmath16 , and the fraction of baryonic matter that ends up in the disk , @xmath17 .",
    "a maximum spin parameter @xmath18 exists , for which a disk is unstable as a function of the fraction of baryons forming the disk , i.e. , for every @xmath19 , disks are stable for @xmath20 .",
    "we here assume ( @xmath19 , @xmath18)=(0.2,0.2 ) . the mass of the forming mbh seeds is set by the joint characteristics of the gas flow and of the evolution of the collapsed gas @xcite . the mass function of mbh seeds peaks at @xmath21 ( see fig .  1 , top right panel ) .",
    "we study mbh evolution within dark matter halos via a monte - carlo algorithm based on the extended press - schechter formalism .",
    "the population of mbhs evolves along with their hosts according to a `` merger driven scenario '' , as described in volonteri et al .",
    "( 2003 ; 2009 ) .",
    "an accretion episode is assumed to occur as a consequence of every major merger ( mass ratio larger than 1:10 ) event . during an accretion episode ,",
    "each mbh accretes an amount of mass , @xmath22 , that scales with the @xmath23 relation of its hosts ( see volonteri & natarajan 2009 ) .",
    "accretion starts after a dynamical timescale and lasts until the mbh has accreted @xmath24 .",
    "we model the accretion rate onto mbhs in two ways . as a baseline model",
    ", we assume that accretion proceeds at the eddington rate ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in a second case , we model the accretion rate during the active phase from the extrapolation of the empirical distribution of eddington ratios , @xmath25 , found in @xcite . we adopt a fitting function of the eddington ratio distribution as a function of mbh mass and redshift ( merloni 2009 ) .",
    "we are here extrapolating such a model at much higher redshifts and lower mbh masses than originally intended .",
    "we caution readers in taking the results of this model face value.the main goal of our exercise is to probe possible sensible ranges for the accretion rates on mbhs .    at each timestep of our monte carlo simulation of halos merger trees , we calculate the average energy density emitted during each timestep by the mbh population as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total mass density ( in comoving units ) accreted by mbhs within the timestep , and @xmath28 is the average radiative efficiency , which we assume depends solely on mbh spins for radiatively efficient accretors .",
    "we evolve mbh spins according to two simple models : coherent accretion @xcite and chaotic accretion @xcite .",
    "these two models lead to rapidly spinning mbhs ( `` high spins '' , @xmath29 ) , and slow rotators ( `` low spins '' , @xmath30 ) respectively .",
    "we assume that mbhs are born non - spinning .    the energy density , @xmath31 , depends on both the accretion rate ( in eddington units , @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 .",
    "assuming constant @xmath34 and @xmath33 , at a given time @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the average mass of mbh seeds in each scenario , and @xmath38 gyr is the eddington timescale .",
    "we can see that if @xmath39 : @xmath40 . within our evolutionary scheme @xmath33",
    "is determined for each mbh , while we have used a single , average , @xmath28 in calculating @xmath31 .",
    "since it takes a few myr for mbhs in the coherent accretion model to spin - up to large spins ( i.e. for the radiative efficiency to increase from 0.06  schwarzschild hole , to 0.2  spin@xmath41 ) this scheme slightly overestimates the radiative output from mbhs in the ` high spin ' case at @xmath42 .",
    "we further assume that a fixed fraction @xmath43 of the bolometric power radiated by high - redshift quasars is emitted as hydrogen - ionizing photons .",
    "the number of ionizing photons scales as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the _",
    "mean _ photon energy ( see section 2 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a thorough discussion about the quasar spectra ; in the following we assume , conservatively , that @xmath46 .",
    "the total comoving energy density of ionizing radiation emitted by the growing mbh population is then : @xmath47 where the sum is over the timesteps between our starting redshift ( @xmath48 , timestep 0 ) , and the timestep , @xmath49 corresponding to the redshift of interest , @xmath50 .    we have also implemented a more pessimistic case for mbh accretion , loosely based on @xcite , where the accretion rate has been fixed to 30% of the eddington accretion rate . in this scenario ,",
    "the yield in ionizing radiation is lower than for the case of 100% eddington rate , but ionization histories in this scenario fall within the range spanned by our other models ; they , thus , do not change any of our conclusions and we do not consider them further in this paper .",
    "our models are consistent with the constraints from the soft x ",
    "ray background @xcite .",
    "our predicted population of high redshift agn would account for almost 5% of the measured ( 0.58 kev ) background , or @xmath51% of the unresolved one @xcite .",
    "models are also consistent with the bolometric luminosity function of quasars at @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "`` large seeds '' are preferred as our fiducial model , based on a better agreement with the bolometric luminosity function at @xmath53 , however we note that in this paper we probe much higher redshifts than those probed by the study of @xcite , hence we consider the match with the luminosity function at lower redshifts as a weak constraint .    for the stellar contribution to the total ionizing background we use the extrapolation of the observed uv luminosity functions of high redshifts galaxies @xcite and the assumed value for the relative ( to the amount of escaped uv light at @xmath54 ) escape fraction of ionizing radiation .",
    "the complete details of the methodology are described in @xcite .",
    "here we only briefly repeat that the total mass - to - light ratios of higher redshift galaxies are computed in a given cosmology by matching the observed spatial abundance of galaxies of a given luminosity to the theoretically computed abundance of halos of a given mass , so that @xmath55 ( and , optionally , an additional factor that accounts for `` bursty '' star formation rate in high redshift galaxies can be incorporated in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : nlm ] ] ; reasonable values for that factor make insignificant impact on our results ) .",
    "the obtained thus mass - to - light ratio can be extrapolated to higher redshifts .",
    "since the mass - to - light ratio is a weak function of redshift , the uncertainty of such an extrapolation does not dominate the final uncertainty of our estimate for the ionizing emissivity from galaxies . instead , the final uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty ( both observational and theoretical ) on the adopted value of the relative escape fraction for ionizing radiation @xcite .    the combined ( stellar plus quasar ) contribution to reionization",
    "can then be estimated as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of ionizations per atom , @xmath58 is the comoving number density of atoms of hydrogen or helium ( we assume that most of helium is only singly ionized during hydrogen ionization ) , and @xmath59 is the mean ionization energy per atom . the first term in this equation accounts for the contribution from stars , the second one includes primary ionizations by ionizing photons from quasars with the mean photon energy @xmath45 , and the last term accounts for secondary ionizations from energetic ionizing photons",
    ". for the gas uniformly ionized to the ionization fraction @xmath60 , the fraction of radiation energy density @xmath61 going into secondary ionizations has been computed by @xcite , and their results can be conveniently fitted by a simple but accurate formula @xcite @xmath62 in reality , of course , the universe is not uniformly ionized , so the quantity @xmath60 in equation ( [ eq : ngb ] ) is an effective value @xmath63 , such that @xmath64 and the average is mass - weighted .",
    "thus , @xmath63 is _ not _ a mass- or volume - weighted average of the cosmic ionization fraction .",
    "however , @xmath65 for the fully neutral and @xmath66 for the fully ionized universe .    the quantity @xmath67 has been computed in @xcite and is not discussed here .",
    "the mean energy of ionizing photons from quasars , @xmath45 , remains a parameter of our model .",
    "the exact value of this parameter obviously depends on the spectral shape of the quasar energy distribution . if we assume a classic multicolor disk spectrum up to @xmath68 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , and a nonthermal power - law component with spectral slope @xmath69 , with @xmath70 at higher energies , we find @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "the spectrum is harder / softer for smaller / larger mbh masses . as a fiducial value",
    ", we adopt @xmath73 ( cfr .",
    "fig  1 ) , and we investigate the sensitivity of our results to the precise value of this parameter in the next section .    equation ( [ eq : ngb ] ) can not be evaluated without an equation for @xmath63 as a function of time .",
    "a complete computation of @xmath74 requires a sophisticated three - dimensional modeling of the transfer of ionizing radiation throughout the inhomogeneous gas density distribution in the universe . since such modeling is well beyond the scope of this paper , we instead introduce the following ansatz for @xmath74 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a parameter .",
    "the motivation of this ansatz follows from the realization that if every atom in the universe is ionized exactly once , then in the beginning of reionization , while @xmath63 is sufficiently small , @xmath77 . , which is small for @xmath78 , and expand @xmath61 in taylor series around @xmath79 , then for sufficiently small @xmath60 , @xmath80 .",
    "] the factor @xmath81 therefore accounts for the loss of ionizing photons to recombinations and for more complicated dependence of @xmath63 on @xmath82 at the later stages of reionization .",
    "this factor can not be too small ( or the universe would never be reionized ) , and any value for @xmath76 above about 0.5 ( half of photons lost for recombination ) does not affect our conclusions .",
    "therefore , in the rest of this paper we adopt @xmath83 as our fiducial value . in reality",
    ", @xmath76 must be a function of time , but since it is not likely to be much lower than 1 , the exact time dependence of @xmath76 is unimportant at the level of precision of our approximations ( which is dominated by the uncertainties on the escape fraction from galaxies and the lack of knowledge for the specific parameters of our quasar model ) .",
    "lcc + @xmath84 & 0.28 & 0.28 + @xmath85 & 0.7 & 0.7 + @xmath86 & 0.82 & 0.84 + @xmath87 & 0.96 & 0.98 +    in the rest of this paper we consider two different cosmological models .",
    "the first one ( which we call `` wmap-5 '' ) is the most likely joint fit to the fifth year wmap data , baryonic acoustic oscillations from sdss , and supernovae , as presented in the second column of table 1 from @xcite .",
    "the second model ( `` wmap-5up '' ) is obtained from the first one by increasing both the amplitude of the density fluctuations @xmath86 and the scalar spectral index @xmath87 upward by 1 standard deviation .",
    "the relevant values of cosmological parameters for these two models are listed in table [ tab : cosmo ] .",
    "figure [ fig : ngb0 ] demonstrates the sensitivity of the total ionizations - to - atom ratio @xmath57 on the assumed value for the mean energy of ionizing photons from quasars @xmath45 . because ionizations from the quasar population are dominated by secondary ionizations ( which are independent of @xmath45 ) for any plausible value of @xmath45 , this parameter has only a mild effect on our results .",
    "figures [ fig : ngb1a ] and [ fig : ngb1b ] now present our main result : the computed @xmath57 as a function of redshift for two cosmologies and various parameters of the quasar model .",
    "the criterion for the universe to be reionized at @xmath1 ( @xmath88 ) we adopt from @xcite , where it is discussed and justified .    clearly , the wmap5 model ( with the most likely values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) is somewhat short of the reionization requirement . as has been discussed by @xcite ,",
    "this is not necessarily a serious problem , since the likely uncertainty on our extremely simple model is a factor of 2 or so .",
    "never - the - less , slightly higher values for @xmath86 and/or @xmath87 provide a wider breathing space for reionization modeling .    in order to illustrate a plausible estimate for the uncertainties due to observational errors on the escape fraction ( c.f .",
    "* ) , high redshift luminosity functions @xcite , etc , we show in figure [ fig : ngb2 ] the `` large seeds - high spin '' quasar model in the wmap-5up cosmology ( which we adopt as our `` fiducial model '' ) together with the estimated errors .",

    "[ fig : ngb2 ] unclosed from below .",
    "we also show the evolution of the effective ionization fraction @xmath63 as an illustrative ( but highly approximate ) reionization history .",
    "since our quasar models cover a wide range of physically plausible possibilities , we can draw some general conclusions from fig.[fig : ngb1a ] and [ fig : ngb1b ] .",
    "in particular , we notice that ( i ) by @xmath90 the quasar contribution to the total ionization budget becomes mostly sub - dominant , not exceeding 50% in the best case , and likely falling below 20% or so .",
    "never - the - less , at @xmath91 in all our models quasars contribute from over 50% up to 90% of ionizations .",
    "this conclusion is particularly important to theoretical modeling and future observational measurements of the expected redshifted @xmath92 emission from neutral hydrogen in the reionization era .",
    "while most of the currently planned pathfinder experiments rely , in part , on the existing simulations for critical design decisions , the predictions from those simulations - none of which include a quasar contribution - become inaccurate at @xmath0 .",
    "it is , therefore , important to keep in mind that much theoretical work still needs to be done before even the basic observables for the incoming @xmath92 experiments ( like the fluctuation power spectrum ) can be computed theoretically with @xmath9320% precision ( within a given cosmological model ) .",
    "most of the contribution to the quasar ionizing budget is dominated by mbhs with mass @xmath94 .",
    "such small , low - luminosity mbhs do not contribute to the bright end of the luminosity function of quasars , and are therefore difficult to account from simple extrapolations of the luminosity function of quasars .",
    "these small holes are not hosted in extremely massive galaxies residing in the highest density peaks ( 5 to 6@xmath13 peaks ) , but are instead found in more common , `` normal '' systems , @xmath95 , peaks .",
    "future generation of space  based telescopes , such as _ jwst _ and _ ixo _ , are likely to detect and constrain the evolution of the population of accreting massive black holes at early times ( @xmath96 ) .",
