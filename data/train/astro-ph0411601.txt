    "while calculations from first principles in qcd are beyond reach , it is well - known that some phenomenological strong interaction models ( such as the mit bag model ) predict metastability and even absolute stability of u - d - s quark matter for some ranges of parameters @xcite .",
    "strange matter metastability could significantly change the properties of neutron star interiors , and absolute stability ( energy per baryon below that of nuclei ) could imply , that `` neutron stars '' are actually strange stars composed of bulk quark matter @xcite .",
    "quark matter in a colour - flavour locked phase and other colour - superconducting phases , where quarks with different colour and flavour quantum numbers form cooper pairs with pairing energy as high as 100  mev is significantly more bound than ordinary quark matter , and this increases the likelihood that quark matter composed of up , down , and strange quarks rather than nuclear matter could be the ground state of bulk hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "finite size effects ( curvature and surface energies ) increase the mass per baryon for small lumps of three flavour quark matter , called strangelets , relative to bulk quark matter .",
    "this and the destabilization in a high - temperature environment would explain the non - observation of strangelets in heavy - ion collisions , even if bulk strange quark matter is stable .",
    "strangelets may thus exist in at least two possible varieties : `` ordinary '' strangelets @xcite  and colour - flavour locked strangelets @xcite .",
    "both types consist of almost equal numbers of up , down , and strange quarks so that the quark charges nearly cancel .",
    "the stability of strangelets depends on the quark masses ( especially the heaviest , strange quark ) and on the strong interaction binding ( in the mit bag model characterized by the bag constant , the one - gluon exchange coupling constant and the pairing energy ) .",
    "finite size effects generally decrease stability at low baryon numbers relative to bulk strange quark matter , though increased stability occurs near closed shells .",
    "`` ordinary '' strangelets are stable for a restricted range of parameters , and if quark matter is in a colour - flavour locked state , as seems to be the case at asymptotically high density , the stability is improved by several tens of mev per baryon , other parameters fixed .    the characteristic property of strangelets relative to nuclei is a very small charge for a given baryon number , @xmath0 , because of the near cancelation of up , down , and strange quark charges in strangelets . for a typical strange quark mass of 150  mev ,",
    "`` ordinary '' strangelets have charge @xmath1 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 for @xmath4 @xcite , and colour - flavour locked strangelets have @xmath5 @xcite . but strangelet masses can be very large ( as high as the baryon number of a gravitationally unstable strange star , @xmath6 ) , so the quark charge @xmath7 can reach values much higher than those known for nuclei in spite of the low charge - to - mass ratio .",
    "atoms can be fully ionized to the nuclear charge , but strangelet core charges can be high enough that electron - positron pairs are created in the vacuum , leaving electrons to screen the central positive charge .",
    "screened charges of several thousand are easily reached , and there is no formal maximum charge , though the screened charge increases only slowly with unscreened charge for high @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the alpha magnetic spectrometer ams-02 on the international space station @xcite is an approximately 0.5  m@xmath8  sterad acceptance particle physics detector with a superconducting magnet providing a 0.86 tesla dipole field .",
    "it is equipped with a transition radiation detector , silicon trackers , time of flight detectors , anticoincidence counters , a ring imaging cherenkov counter , and an electromagnetic calorimeter , and it will analyze the flux of cosmic ray nuclei and particles in unprecedented detail for at least three years following deployment in 2007 or 2008 . besides all the other interesting physics to be carried out , it will be sensitive to strangelets in a wide range of mass and charge , for rigidities in the gv  tv regime @xcite .",
    "a prototype ams-01 was successfully flown on the space shuttle mission sts-91 in 1998 @xcite .",
    "therefore it is of interest to know the rigidity spectrum and total flux of cosmic ray strangelets @xcite .",
    "if strange matter is stable , neutron stars are likely to be strange stars , and cosmic ray strangelets will be created when two strange stars in a binary system collide after inspiral due to loss of orbital energy in the form of gravitational radiation .",
    "the galactic coalescence rate for neutron ( quark ) star binaries has recently been updated from observations of binary pulsars to @xcite @xmath9 myr@xmath10 ( 95% confidence ) , thus of order one collision in our galaxy every 10.000 years .",
    "binary inspiral lead to tidal disruption of the stars as they approach each other before the final collision . during this stage",
    "small fractions of the total mass may be released from the binary system in the form of strange quark matter .",
    "simulations of binary neutron star collisions indicate the release of @xmath11 ( depending on orbital and stellar parameters ) , where @xmath12 denotes the solar mass .",
    "no high - resolution simulations of collisions involving two strange stars have been performed , and the physics in black hole - strange star collisions , where newtonian and semirelativistic results do exist @xcite , is too different from the strange star - strange star collision to be of real guidance . given the stiffness of the equation of state for strange quark matter , strange star - strange star collisions should lie in the low end of the mass release range found for neutron stars , so a conservative estimate of the galactic production rate of strangelets is @xmath13 .",
    "the quark matter lumps originally released by tidal forces are macroscopic in size @xcite . when estimated from a balance between quark matter surface tension and tidal forces , a typical fragment baryon number is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the surface tension in units of 20 mev/@xmath16 and @xmath17 is the distance between the stars in units of 30 km .",
    "but subsequent collisions will lead to fragmentation , and if the collision energy compensates for the extra surface and curvature energy needed to make smaller strangelets , a significant fraction of the mass released from binary strange star collisions may end up as strangelets with @xmath18 .",
    "however , these values are strongly parameter dependent @xcite .",
    "most of the total flux results for cosmic ray strangelets derived in @xcite are such that values for some given @xmath0 can be used as a lower limit for the flux for a fixed total strangelet mass injection if strangelets have a distribution with baryon numbers below @xmath0 .",
    "there is no reliable way of calculating the actual mass spectrum , so all strangelets released are assumed to have a single baryon number , @xmath0 .",
    "strangelets in many ways behave like cosmic ray nuclei , but with a very high @xmath19-ratio . due to the high strangelet rigidity , @xmath20 , at fixed velocity strangelets",
    "are efficiently injected into accelerating shocks , and most strangelets passed by a supernova shock will take part in fermi acceleration .",
    "this results in a source spectrum which is a powerlaw in rigidity .",
    "the timescales for strangelet acceleration , spallation , energy loss , and escape from the galaxy are all short compared to the age of the milky way galaxy . therefore cosmic ray strangelets can be described by a steady state distribution , which is a solution to a propagation equation of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number density of strangelets at position @xmath23 and time @xmath24 with energy in the range @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "@xmath26 is given by a sum of a source term from supernova acceleration , a diffusion term , loss terms due to escape from the galaxy , energy loss , spallation , and a term to describe reacceleration of strangelets due to passage of new supernova shock waves .",
    "the various terms and numerical as well as approximate analytical solutions to the propagation equation are discussed in @xcite ; here we limit ourselves to a few numerical examples shown in the figures , and an analytic estimate for the total flux .    .",
    "solar modulation but not geomagnetic cutoff has been included.,height=453 ]    as discussed in @xcite solar modulation ( the interaction of cosmic ray strangelets with the outflowing solar wind ) effectively cuts off the strangelet flux at rigidities of order @xmath27gv .",
    "it turns out , that the strangelet flux is governed by spallation at the cutoff rigidity , i.e. strangelet destruction in inelastic collisions with interstellar nuclei is the most important process for galactic strangelets at these rigidities .",
    "this allows an estimate for the total flux hitting the moon or earth given by @xmath28^{-1.2}\\lambda,\\ ] ] depending on whether solar modulation or geomagnetic cutoff dominates ( the cutoff rigidity for ams in the geomagnetic field , @xmath29 , is in the range from 115 gv depending primarily on geomagnetic latitude ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the normalization of the flux are hidden in the parameter @xmath30 , which is proportional to the galactic production rate of strangelets , inversely proportional to the density of the interstellar medium and the effective cosmic ray confinement volume in the galaxy , etc . the exact definition of @xmath30 is given in @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 is of order unity for typical choices of parameters , including the strangelet production rate of @xmath31 solar masses per year discussed above .    in the case of solar modulation domination ( always relevant for the moon , and relevant for ams as long as @xmath32 ) one obtains @xmath33 which reproduces the numerical results in figure 2 to within 20% for @xmath34 and to within a factor of @xmath35 even for small @xmath7 , where the assumptions of nonrelativistic strangelets and spallation domination are dubious .",
    "many uncertainties are involved in the calculation of the strangelet flux , but it is very interesting , that the predictions in figure 2 are well within reach of an experiment like ams-02 .",
    "the nature of ultra - high energy cosmic rays at energies above @xmath36ev is one of the most challenging puzzles in modern physics ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "protons and nuclei are responsible for most of the cosmic ray flux at lower energies , but they can not easily be accelerated to the highest energies , and even if they are , their interactions with photons in the cosmic microwave background radiation are sufficiently energetic to lead to photo - pion and photo - pair production , as well as ( for nuclei ) photo - disintegration .",
    "this leads to the so - called gzk - cutoff in flux @xcite at energies around @xmath37ev for protons , and @xmath36ev for iron .",
    "the observed flux shows no clear cut at these energies ( though the number of events is small , and there is inconsistency between different experiments ) , with observed cosmic ray energies as high as @xmath38ev .",
    "numerous models have been suggested for the nature of cosmic rays beyond the gzk - cutoff , a significant fraction of these involving `` new physics '' , but at present no generally accepted explanation exists @xcite .    strangelets can be much more massive and have a much higher charge than nuclei , while still keeping a low charge - to - mass ratio .",
    "these are exactly the properties required to solve the acceleration problem @xcite and move the gzk - cutoff to much higher energies @xcite .",
    "the maximum relativistic energy of a charged cosmic ray particle accelerated in an astrophysical `` accelerator '' is given by @xmath39 , where the maximal rigidity is the value of @xmath20 where the particle larmor radius in the magnetic field ( which is proportional to @xmath20 ) exceeds the size of the accelerator .",
    "thus , higher charge means higher maximal energy . for typical cosmic ray nuclei , @xmath40 , and",
    "this makes it essentially impossible to reach the highest cosmic ray energies observed by means of astrophysical source acceleration of protons or nuclei , given the astrophysical source limitations on @xmath41 .    but much higher charge and therefore maximal acceleration energy can be achieved for strangelets @xcite .",
    "the average photon energy in the 3k cosmic microwave background radiation is a mere @xmath42ev .",
    "but an ultra - high energy cosmic ray proton with a lorentz - factor in excess of @xmath43 will reach the threshold for the processes @xmath44 , leading to significant energy loss and a drop in cosmic ray flux at proton energies above @xmath37ev .",
    "photo - disintegration of nuclei has a threshold of only 10mev rather than @xmath45 in the rest frame of the nucleus , so the cosmic ray flux of nuclei should drop at a lorentz factor of order @xmath46 , corresponding to @xmath47ev ( detailed calculations result in a drop at energies somewhat lower than found by these simple estimates ) .",
    "but since the threshold energy is proportional to @xmath0 , high - mass strangelets are not influenced by these processes at the energies of interest , and therefore the gzk - cutoff for strangelets moves to energies much larger than the maximum energy cosmic rays observed to date @xcite .",
    "because of their higher charge , strangelets have larger gyro - radii in the galactic magnetic field than protons or nuclei .",
    "therefore a prediction of the strangelet model is , that the distribution of arrival directions on the sky should become more isotropic for strangelets than for nuclei @xcite .",
    "balberg @xcite has argued that a galactic flux of ultrahigh energy strangelets is basically ruled out because they would trigger transformation of all neutron stars into strange quark matter stars .",
    "he argued , that all neutron stars can not be strange stars , and therefore finds the scenario in @xcite unlikely .",
    "as i shall briefly discuss below , neither of these arguments are necessarily correct , but they revive an old discussion about the ( im)possibility of stable strange quark matter which it seems worthwhile to address .",
    "the first assumption in @xcite neglects the fact that strangelets at the relevant energies will be destroyed in collisions with the stars they are supposed to transform .",
    "strangelet fragmentation will occur if the total energy added in inelastic collisions with nuclei exceeds the strangelet binding energy , which can be some tens of mev per baryon .",
    "while the details of strangelet fragmentation remains to be studied ( much of the necessary input physics is poorly known ) order - of - magnitude estimates demonstrate that ultrahigh energy strangelets will be destroyed in collisions rather than serve as seeds to transform neutron stars into strange stars @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the extremely high energy cosmic ray strangelets treated in @xcite , even a small flux of strangelets at low energies would be able to convert all neutron stars into strange stars .",
    "this was discussed in detail in @xcite . at that time",
    "it was argued that this ruled out the hypothesis of stable strange quark matter and strangelets , because some properties of pulsars ( especially the sudden spin - up events called glitches ) seemed inconsistent with strange star properties .",
    "balberg @xcite revives these arguments and lists a set of such properties including glitches , r - mode instabilities and cooling .",
    "however at the current level of understanding one should not rule out strange stars on these grounds .",
    "the strange star glitch problem @xcite has been shown to be marginally consistent with ordinary strange stars with nuclear crusts @xcite , and may also find an explanation in the crystalline phases discovered in colour - superconducting quark matter @xcite .",
    "the r - mode instabilities that rule out the simplest colour - flavour locked strange stars @xcite could also be consistent in models with crystalline phases , and similar counterexamples exist for the other effects mentioned in @xcite .",
    "it is not known at present whether strange stars exist at all , but it is not ruled out either , that all `` neutron '' stars could be strange stars .",
    "a strangelet scenario for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays provides simple explanations for the acceleration problem and the gzk - cutoff problem .",
    "it is however only one among many models in the literature .",
    "there is no convincing evidence either in favour or against stable strangelets in ordinary cosmic rays .",
    "the flux at gv  tv rigidities could well be in a range that can be probed in the upcoming ams-02 experiment on the international space station .",
    "there is also hope for testing the stable strangelet hypothesis in a more restricted mass and charge range in a coming search in lunar soil , where strangelets could have been deposited over timespans of hundreds of millions of years .",
    "strange quark matter stability is an exciting possibility .",
    "the validity of the idea can not be decided on the basis of theory alone .",
    "fortunately , experimental tests involving cosmic rays may settle the issue within a few years .",
    "this work was supported by the danish natural science research council .",
