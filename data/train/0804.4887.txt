    "strongly correlated electron systems in one dimension ( 1d ) have become an area of immense interest from the perspective of both fundamental and technological aspects of nanophysics .",
    "intense experimental effort has focused on such realizations of quantum wires with a few or single conducting channels as cleaved - edge @xcite , v - groove @xcite , and crystallized - in - a - matrix @xcite semiconductor quantum wires , coupled quantum hall edges running in opposite directions @xcite , single - wall carbon nanotubes @xcite , polymer nanofibers @xcite , and metallic nanowires @xcite .",
    "central to much of the fascinating physics of the 1d systems is that electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions in 1d geometry can have dramatic effects leading to the emergence of a luttinger liquid ( ll ) @xcite .",

    "however , as far as a disordered ll is concerned , a number of important questions , even at the most fundamental level , remained largely unanswered until very recently ( for a review see ref .",

    ", all electron states are localized even for an arbitrarily weak random potential and the localization length is the mean free path . in the case of noninteracting electrons , the quantum localization in 1d",
    "has been studied in great detail ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "a principal complication that arises in the disordered ll is that the quantum interference phenomena yielding the anderson localization are conventionally treated in terms of fermions , by employing the concepts of interference and dephasing of fermionic excitations .",
    "the question of to what extent the notion of phase relaxation in the localization problem is applicable to the ( non - fermi ) ll is therefore of crucial importance . recently , this problem was addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the interaction - induced dephasing rate that governs the localization term in the conductivity of the disordered ll was calculated .",
    "another conceptually nontrivial aspect of the interplay between disorder and interaction concerns the nonequilibrium properties of the ll . in the homogeneous case , the ll model is completely integrable and as such does not exhibit any relaxation to equilibrium : an arbitrary excited state will never decay to the equilibrium state characterized by temperature .",
    "of central importance is therefore the question of how the equilibration of fermionic and/or bosonic excitations in the ll occurs in the presence of disorder .",

    "<S> the luttinger liquid model , which describes interacting electrons in a single - channel quantum wire , is completely integrable in the absence of disorder and as such does not exhibit any relaxation to equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we consider relaxation processes induced by inelastic electron - electron interactions in a disordered luttinger liquid , focusing on the equilibration rate and its essential differences from the electron - electron scattering rate as well as the rate of phase relaxation . in the first part of the paper , we review the basic concepts in the disordered luttinger liquid at equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> these include the elastic renormalization , dephasing , and interference - induced localization . </S>",
    "<S> in the second part , we formulate a conceptually important framework for systematically studying the nonequilibrium properties of the strongly correlated ( non - fermi ) luttinger liquid . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a coupled set of kinetic equations for the fermionic and bosonic distribution functions that describe the evolution of the nonequilibrium luttinger liquid . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the energy equilibration rate in the conducting disordered quantum wire ( at sufficiently high temperature , when the localization effects are suppressed by dephasing ) is shown to be of the order of the rate of elastic scattering off disorder , independent of the interaction constant and temperature . </S>"
