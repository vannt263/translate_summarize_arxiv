    "charged multiplicity in dis are measured in both the hadronic center - of - mass ( hcm ) frame and the breit frame , using an integrated luminosity of @xmath1 . only hadrons in the current fragmentation regions of both frames were used due to detector acceptance limitations .    the mean charged multiplicity is shown in figure [ multipli](left ) in the current region of the hcm frame as a function of energy , w , and in the current region of the breit frame as a function of @xmath2 .",
