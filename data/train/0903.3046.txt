    ", the dusty ce01 template provides a good fit to the data . for wavelengths shorter than @xmath66 m , the measured flux densities of the galaxy are fainter than the model prediction , indicating that the source is very heavily obscured by dust , as discussed in the next section",
    "finally , we note that the radio - ir sed of gn10 is virtualy identical to those of gn20 and gn20.2a that are securely confirmed to be at @xmath19 ( d09 ) .",
    "scaling them down by a factor of 1.8 , all the flux measurements for gn20 at radio - ir wavelengths agree with gn10 within the uncertainties , including the co[4 - 3 ] emission line flux .",

    "this is a remarkable degree of uniformity , to the @xmath67% level of the various measurement errors , in the dust continuum and co properties .",
    "given that the radio - ir flux ratios are in general a very strong function of redshift , this is strong evidence that the redshift of gn10 is very close to that of gn20 and gn20.2a .",
    "although a detection of additional emission lines of co will be required to definitely confirm the redshift identification , we conclude that , based on the 3 arguments presented above , there is already compelling evidence for identification of the line as co[4 - 3 ] at @xmath43 .",

    "the radio flux of @xmath74jy ( dannerbauer et al .  2008 ) corresponds to @xmath75  w  hz@xmath9 .",
    "together with our estimate of @xmath76 , gn10 lies on the local radio - ir correlation ( e.g. , yun et al .",
    "2001 ) , as found also for gn20 ( d09 )",
    ".    while the seds of gn10 , gn20 and gn20.2a are very similar at radio - ir wavelengths , the galaxies are quite different at wavelengths shorter than 10@xmath6 m , where the light is dominated by the emission of stars . gn20 and gn20.2a are classified as b - band dropouts in the hst+acs imaging , and both are relatively luminous and blue in the uv rest frame .",
    "this indicates a relatively low extinction by dust . instead , gn10 is undetected at uv and optical rest frame wavelengths , implying overall a very strong extinction of the stellar light by dust .",
    "it seems likely that the dust extinction in these galaxies is not homogeneous . among the few known smgs with",
    "confirmed co redshifts @xmath77 , gn20 , gn20.2a and the @xmath78 smg by capak et al .",
    "( 2008 ; see also schinnerer et al .",
    "2008 ) all have significant offsets of order of @xmath79 or more between the detected ( and relatively blue ) uv emission and the radio or co positions .",
    "this suggests a complex dust distribution with ` holes ' that , in some cases , allow us to directly observe the emission from stars . in the case of gn10",
    ", however , the uv / optical light seems to be wholly obscured along our line of sight .",
    "we now discuss what levels of extinction and reddening are required to explain the observed properties of gn10 .",
    "we can use the photometry comparison to gn20 and gn20.2a to derive a first guess of the amount of extinction present , assuming that to first order the stellar mass to ir continuum luminosity ratio is the same within these galaxies .",
    "normalizing the galaxies seds at wavelengths longer than 10@xmath6 m , gn10 is found to be @xmath80 mag fainter in the irac bands ( observed 0.71.6@xmath6 m rest frame ) than both gn20 and gn20.2a . for a calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) attenuation law this corresponds to @xmath2 mag . if we fit the uv rest frame to near - ir rest - frame sed with constant star formation models from the maraston ( 2005 ) library , this requires an even larger @xmath81 mag , mainly to be consistent with the very deep flux limit from the k - band observations of wang et al .  (",
    "2009 ) .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows this fit ( red curve in the top panel ) and its residuals ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the fit is redder than the trend suggested by the irac bands .",
    "fitting only the irac bands would suggest again a reddening of @xmath2 mag . the k - band flux density upper limit by wang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] is derived for a 0.6@xmath23 aperture , but the stellar light might be well distributed over a larger region . in such a case",
    "a less stringent k - band upper limit would be allowed , and solutions with less attenuation than @xmath81 mag would become plausible .",
    "we conclude that there is evidence for extreme obscuration , likely at some level between @xmath27.5 for a calzetti law .",
    "the fits imply a stellar mass of about @xmath82 ( chabrier imf ) for gn10 . given the case for extreme obscuration ,",
    "this stellar mass estimate should be treated with some caution .",
    "we note that the large co[4 - 3 ] line width of about 770  km  s@xmath9 ( very similar to those for gn20 and gn20.2a ) suggests a large dynamical mass , assuming that the size of the co emission is typical ( e.g. , a few kpc ; tacconi et al .",
    ". this would be consistent with the stellar mass that we derive .",
    "that stellar mass for gn10 is 3 times larger than the nominal completeness limit for the irac - selected sample of massive galaxy candidates at @xmath83 from mancini et al .",
    "however , gn10 is absent from the mancini sample because it is fainter than the adopted irac magnitude limit ( @xmath84 ab ) , due to its extreme attenuation .",
    "this illustrates how dust obscuration can be a significant limitation for constructing complete samples of galaxies in the distant universe , even when using surveys based on spitzer irac data .",
    "on the basis of the identitication of the line as co[4 - 3 ] at @xmath43 , gn10 is now the third smg in the @xmath19 goods - n proto - cluster structure .",
    "our finding also supports the suggestion that there is indeed a substantial population of smgs @xmath77 ( e.g. , dannerbauer et al .  2002 ; 2004 ; 2008 ; dunlop et al .  2004 ; wang et al .  2007 ; 2009",

    "contrarily to gn20 and gn20.2a , gn10 is not surrounded by an excess of b - band dropout lyman break galaxies : only two such objects are present within 25@xmath23 from gn10 , while 14 are found within the same distance from gn20 .",
    "of these two b - band dropout galaxies one has an optical spectroscopic redshift of @xmath85 ( stern et al .",
    ", in preparation ; based on the detection of ly@xmath86 emission with keck+deimos ) , placing it in the proto - cluster structure , while the other has no known spectroscopic redshift .",

    "the velocity separation of @xmath88  km  s@xmath9 ( from @xmath89 ) corresponds to a line - of - sight distance of @xmath90  mpc comoving ( this is likely an upper limit , as part of the velocity separation could be due to peculiar velocities within the structure ) .",
    "gn10 is closer to gn20.2a both in the sky and in velocity space .",
