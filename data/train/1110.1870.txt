    "since these two processes have an opposite detuning , their amplitudes cancel @xmath182 , except when the exchanged phonon belongs to the same mode @xmath183 .",

    "due to the algebraic properties of the pauli matrices , the above cancellation between the two paths does not take place in this case , and one obtains an ac - stark shift that depends on the phonons , namely @xmath186 this term has a dramatic effect on the quantum logic gates since it couples the spins to the phonons with a strength similar to that of the desired gate .",
    "hence , the spin dynamics becomes sensitive to the thermal motion of the ions , and the geometric character of the phase gates is lost .",

    "the red - sideband term becomes @xmath196 from this expression , one readily observes that the terms involving transitions between the dressed eigenstates rotate very fast for @xmath197 , and their contribution to the effective interactions will be negligible . in order to give a stronger weight to the terms diagonal in the dressed - state basis ,",
    "we perform the spin - dependent displacement @xmath198 .",
    "this canonical transformation is formalized in terms of a lang - firsov - type polaron transformation  @xcite as follows @xmath199 which has also been used in the context of trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "this unitary offers an alternative mechanism to obtain the spin interactions by virtual phonon exchange , and also allow us to calculate all the residual spin - phonon couplings to any desired order of the small parameter @xmath200 .",
    "in particular , considering the algebraic properties of the spins and phonons , it transforms the relevant operators as follows @xmath201 where @xmath202 therefore , it displaces the phonon operators , whereas it rotates the spins around the @xmath124-axis .",

    ", we have to make sure that there is no resonance with a process that does not conserve the number of phonons . for the parameters of interest to our setup , it suffices to consider that @xmath66 to avoid such processes , and thus minimize the effects of the residual spin - phonon coupling .    by refocusing the fast rotations induced by the resonant microwave ( as considered in the main text )",

    "note that the effective interaction in eq .",
    "is not modified by considering a different phase @xmath212 , or equivalently @xmath213 .",
    "intuitively , one may consider that this phase only affects the trajectory of the displaced phonons , but not the geometric phase  @xcite .",
    "formally , this is a consequence of the perturbative process where phonon excitations are virtually created and annihilated , such that the qubit - qubit couplings only depend on terms like @xmath214 , which are independent of the laser phases . according to the raman process [ fig .",
    "[ magnesium_levels ] ] , this type of terms follow from the absorption and emission of a photon in each of the two laser beams , thus canceling the dependence on the laser phase . note that the same insensitivity occurs in the presence of a strong driving  .",
    "this is a clear advantage with respect to m@xmath102lmer - s@xmath102rensen gates  @xcite , since those depend on the phases of two different sidebands that follow from a bichromatic laser beam , and are thus subjected to fluctuations in the optical path length .",
    "we have also assumed a vanishing phase of the carrier interaction  , and argued that the essence of the decoupling mechanism is not altered .",
    "let us consider the effects of a non - vanishing phase @xmath191 . in this case",
    ", the dressed - state basis must be modified to @xmath215 , and thus the red - sideband excitation   in that basis becomes @xmath216 note that we can still apply the same rotating wave approximation when @xmath217 , and thus neglect some of the terms in the above expression .",
    "this encourages a modification of the polaron - type transformation @xmath218 , where we have introduced the dressed spin operator @xmath219 . by the same argument used above",
    ", we see that the phase appearing in the polaron transformation does not play any role .",
    "hence , we would obtain an the same effective hamiltonian as in eq .  , but",

    "we have thus arrived at the final conclusion that the effective hamiltonian does only depend on the phase of the carrier excitation , but not on the phase of the red sideband .",
    "this is a clear advantage for our qubit choice , since the carrier phase comes from a microwave source , which is more stable than the laser beams leading to the sideband .",
    "the internal level structure of trapped ions can be perturbed by uncontrolled external electric and magnetic fields . since the stark shifts are typically small  @xcite , one is only concerned with magnetic - field fluctuations of the resonance frequency @xmath221 . for clock states , either there is no such magnetic - field dependence ( e.g. @xmath222 have both zero magnetic moment ) , or the linear zeeman shift vanishes at a certain magnetic field . in such cases ,",
    "the internal state coherence times can reach even minutes . on the other hand , when none of the above conditions holds , one refers to magnetic - field sensitive states whose typical coherence times are reduced by magnetic - field fluctuations to @xmath2231 - 10ms .",

    "low - frequency fluctuations ( i.e. fluctuations that only take place between different experimental runs ) can be easily prevented by using spin - echo sequences  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the effects of fast - frequency fluctuations can not be refocused unless complicated dynamical - decoupling sequences are used .",
    "we are concerned with this type of fast fluctuations , which lead to an exponential decay of the coherences @xmath227 as measured by ramsey interferometry  @xcite . in order to reproduce such an exponential decay",
    ", we use a paradigmatic model of noise where @xmath85 corresponds to a stationary , markovian , and gaussian random process .",

    "this particular stochastic differential equation can be integrated exactly yielding a gaussian random process with the following mean and variance @xmath232 which show that the correlation time @xmath87 sets the time scale over which the process relaxes to the asymptotic values .",
    "besides , the autocorrelation function @xmath233 shows that @xmath87 also sets the time scale such that the values of process are correlated or not , where we have assumed a vanishing mean as customary .",

    "let us finally comment on the modification of the lang - firsov transformation in the presence of the magnetic noise  , which would lead to extra residual spin - phonon couplings",
    ". however , these contributions are negligible for the regime of interest @xmath240-@xmath241 ms .",
    "this can be understood by considering the variance at long times , which leads to @xmath242 .",
    "since the magnetic - field noise in ion traps corresponds to the limit @xmath239 , we have considered @xmath243 throughout the text , which leads to a typical noise strength in the 0.1 - 1 khz regime .",

    "we have quantified the efficiency of the quantum gate for particular entangled bell states .",
    "however , it is also desirable to evaluate how close is the real time - evolution of the system to the desired unitary @xmath95 .",
    "this can be quantified by the following fidelity @xmath245 where one integrates over the whole hilbert space of two - qubit states @xmath246 , and @xmath247 is the quantum channel that describes the real time - evolution of the trapped - ion setup @xmath248 where @xmath249 describes the time - evolution of the complete spin - phonon system including the stochastic average over the magnetic field noise , and @xmath250 corresponds to the thermal gibbs state for the phonons . the integral over the state space in eq .",

    "we place a special emphasis on the state - of - the - art experimental implementations where the natural noise sources limiting the fidelities have been discussed ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "let us first consider the implementations of the cirac - zoller scheme for two - ion quantum gates with the highest fidelities @xmath267 for gate times @xmath268 ms  @xcite .",
    "these fidelities were limited by two error sources , namely , off - resonant contributions to the carrier transition , and fluctuating laser frequencies and magnetic fields shifting the resonance frequency .",
    "additionally , these experiments require single - ion addressing and a perfect laser cooling to the motional ground - state , which can be hard to extend to larger ion registers .",
    "as shown in the main text , our scheme overcomes all these problems .",
    "the carrier is continuously driven so that the above off - resonant contribution plays no significant role ( note , however , that we must still be careful with the off - resonant contributions to other zeeman sublevels ) .",
    "the fluctuations of the resonance frequency are cured by the continuous decoupling mechanism . besides , single - ion addressing during the gate is not required , and we have shown that there is no necessity of perfect ground - state cooling , while potentially attaining higher fidelities @xmath269 with similar speeds @xmath270 ms .",
    "let us now compare our scheme to the so - called @xmath271 geometric phase gates  @xcite , which achieved a fidelity @xmath272 for two - qubit gates with speeds @xmath273 ms .",
    "our gate scheme shares some of the advantages of this gate , such as the robustness to thermal fluctuations of the ion motion , the absence of single - ion addressability , and the resilience to off - resonant contributions to the carrier transition .",
    "it is precisely the latter which allows the @xmath271-gate to attain higher speeds as compared to the above cirac - zoller gates .",
    "in fact , these speeds are required to achieve such high fidelities in the presence of the errors due to due to drifts of the laser frequencies and fluctuating magnetic fields .",
    "besides , the photon scattering due to the raman beam arrangement introduces additional decoherence .",
    "our scheme overcomes the fluctuations in the resonance frequency by means of the continuous decoupling , which allows us to boost the coherence times far beyond the millisecond regime , reaching higher fidelities @xmath269 for slower gates @xmath270 ms .",
    "in fact , the dynamical decoupling allows still slower gates so that we may use a lower rabi frequency for the raman beams , or alternatively a larger detuning with respect to the auxiliary dipole - allowed transition , thus reducing further the noise by photon scattering  @xcite .",
    "let us finally note that a source of dephasing noise common to both gate schemes is that of fluctuating rabi frequencies of the spin - phonon couplings .",
    "this problem can be overcome by stabilizing the laser intensities on long time scales .",

    "our scheme solves the fluctuating ac - stark shifts by the dynamical decoupling , and may minimize the photon scattering at the expense of using slower gates ( note that the gates are still much faster than the coherence time enhanced via the decoupling mechanism ) .",
    "hence , it can reach higher fidelities @xmath269 while preserving the advantages of the @xmath274-gate , which is insensitive to thermal fluctuations  @xcite , uses a laser beam configuration that makes it resilient to slow drifts of the laser phases  @xcite , and overcomes magnetic field fluctuations by using magnetic - field insensitive states  @xcite .",
    "as emphasized in the main text , one of the challenges of quantum - information processing is the implementation of quantum logic gates below the fault - tolerance threshold .",
    "so far , this has only been achieved for ion optical qubits coupled by a mlmer - srensen ( ms ) scheme  @xcite , which achieved fidelities @xmath277 for two ground - state cooled ions with gate speeds of @xmath278 ms . as a consequence of the vanishingly small spontaneous decay rate on the optical transition , the scheme is completely insensitive to the photon scattering that occurs for hyperfine qubits due to the raman beams .",
    "the remaining sources of noise are caused by off - resonant contributions to the carrier transition , fluctuations of the laser frequency , and changes in the laser intensities .",
    "we note that our scheme can overcome two of these errors reaching similar fidelities @xmath269 , while it shares the sensitivity to fluctuations of the spin - phonon laser rabi frequencies .",
    "the advantage of our decoupling protocol becomes more relevant as the ion number is increased , since the sensitivity of the ms scheme to magnetic field noise grows quadratically with the number of ions  @xcite .    in the above schemes ,",

    "recently , there has been a growing interest in developing quantum gates that use radio - frequency or microwave radiation  @xcite , which directly overcome the problems due to photon scattering in the raman configuration , and benefit from the better control over the amplitude and phase of this type of radiation . in  @xcite ,",
    "two - qubit quantum gates for clock states with a fidelity of @xmath279 and speeds of @xmath280 ms were achieved by means of oscillating magnetic - field gradients generated in the near - field of microwave currents . in this case",

    "<S> we introduce a novel scheme that combines phonon - mediated quantum logic gates in trapped ions with the benefits of continuous dynamical decoupling . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate theoretically that a strong driving of the qubit decouples it from external magnetic - field noise , enhancing the fidelity of two - qubit quantum gates </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the scheme does not require ground - state cooling , and is inherently robust to undesired ac - stark shifts . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying mechanism can be extended to a variety of other systems where a strong driving protects the quantum coherence of the qubits without compromising the two - qubit couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> a quantum processor is an isolated quantum device where information can be stored quantum - mechanically over long periods of time , but also manipulated and retrieved . </S>",
    "<S> this forbids its perfect isolation , making such a device sensitive to the noise introduced by either external sources , or experimental imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the interactions between distant quantum bits ( qubits ) , as required to perform quantum logic operations , are frequently achieved by auxiliary ( quasi)particles whose fluctuations introduce an additional source of noise . as emphasized recently  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one of the big challenges of quantum - information science is the quest for methods to cope with all these natural error sources , achieving error rates that allow fault tolerant quantum error correction .    </S>",
    "<S> we address this problem in detail for a prominent architecture , namely , trapped atomic ions  @xcite . among the most relevant sources of noise in this system  @xcite , we can list the following : _ ( i ) _ thermal noise introduced by auxiliary quasiparticles ( i.e. phonons ) , _ ( ii)_fluctuating external magnetic fields , _ ( iii ) _ uncompensated ac - stark shifts due to fluctuations in the laser parameters , and _ </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) _ drifts in the phases of the applied laser beams . </S>",
    "<S> there are two different strategies to overcome these obstacles : _ ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> _ minimize the thermal fluctuations by laser cooling  @xcite , searching for gates operating faster than the timescale set by the other noise sources  @xcite , or _ ( b ) _ </S>",
    "<S> look for schemes that are _ intrinsically robust _ to the different types of noise . among the latter , </S>",
    "<S> there are certain schemes that provide partial solutions to the above noise fluctuations , such as gates that are robust to the thermal motion of the ions  @xcite , or the encoding in magnetic - field insensitive states  @xcite and decoherence - free subspaces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there has been a growing effort to implement microwave - based quantum - information processing  @xcite , exploiting the excellent control over the phase and amplitude of microwaves as compared to laser fields . despite these efforts </S>",
    "<S> , it remains a key challenge to suppress all of the above sources of noise . </S>",
    "<S> here , we propose to accomplish such a step , achieving fault - tolerant error bounds , by a continuous version of dynamical decoupling at reach of current technology .    </S>",
    "<S> while pulsed dynamical decoupling is a well - developed technique  @xcite that has already been demonstrated for ions  @xcite , its optimal combination with two - qubit gates requires a considerable additional effort  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , simpler protocols are a subject of recent interest  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we hereby present a decoupling scheme well suited , but not limited , to trapped - ion experiments with three important properties : _ generality , simplicity , _ and _ robustness_. this scheme is sufficiently general to be applied to any type ion qubits . </S>",
    "<S> it is simple since it combines two standard tools available in most ion trap laboratories , namely a carrier and a red - sideband excitation . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it relies on the strong driving of the carrier transition , which may be realized by laser beams for optical qubits , or by microwaves for hyperfine and zeeman qubits . with this independent driving source , we improve simultaneously the performance and the speed of the gate , as compared to the light - shift gates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides , this driving has the potential of simplifying certain aspects of previous gate schemes  @xcite , and is responsible for the gate robustness at different levels . on top of decoupling the qubits from the magnetic - field noise </S>",
    "<S> , it suppresses the errors due to the thermal ion motion , and to uncompensated ac - stark shifts . </S>",
    "<S> when focusing on hyperfine or zeeman qubits , we can further benefit from the phase and amplitude stability of microwaves . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , concatenated drivings may overcome amplitude fluctuations  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ the system. _ we focus on @xmath0mg@xmath1 to exploit the benefits of microwave technology  @xcite , although the scheme is also valid for other ion species . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider two hyperfine states @xmath2 with energy difference @xmath3 to form our qubit ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the ions arrange in a string along the axis of a linear paul trap characterized by the radial and axial frequencies @xmath4 ( table  [ o_magnitude ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the small radial vibrations yield a set of collective vibrational modes of frequencies @xmath5 , whose excitations are the transverse phonons @xmath6  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the qubit - qubit couplings are mediated by these quasiparticles  @xcite , the scheme becomes less sensitive to ion - heating / thermal motion , and easier to operate within the lamb - dicke regime .    as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dipole_forces]*(a ) * , a pair of laser beams in a raman configuration ( red arrows ) induces a transition between the qubit states via an auxiliary excited state . by setting their frequency beatnote @xmath7 close to @xmath8 , such that the detuning @xmath9 is much smaller than the radial trap frequency ( see table  [ o_magnitude ] for the bare detuning @xmath10 ) , one obtains the red - sideband excitation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we drive the carrier transition ( blue arrow ) . for our particular qubit choice </S>",
    "<S> , this driving can be performed with microwave radiation of frequency @xmath11 , such that the complete hamiltonian is @xmath12 where we have introduced the microwave rabi frequency @xmath13 , and the sideband coupling strengths @xmath14 scale linearly with the laser rabi frequency @xmath15 and lamb - dicke parameter @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 ( table  [ o_magnitude ] ) . here </S>",

    "<S> the states @xmath19 and @xmath20 from the groundstate manifold @xmath21 form our qubit . </S>",
    "<S> two laser beams @xmath22 drive the red sideband via an off - resonant excited state , and a microwave @xmath13 directly couples to the transition . * </S>",

    "<S> each force aims at displacing the normal modes along a closed trajectory in phase space , which is determined by the particular eigenstates @xmath37 of the pauli matrices @xmath38  @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dipole_forces]*(b ) * , we describe the action of the @xmath23-force on a single trapped ion . depending on the spin state @xmath39 , the ion follows a different path in phase space . after returning to the starting point </S>",
    "<S> , the ion picks a geometric phase independent of the motional state , and only determined by the area enclosed by the trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> the spin dependence of these trajectories , together with the collective nature of the phonons , are the key ingredients of the two - qubit geometric phase gates for trapped ions in thermal motion . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the much simpler single red - sideband , @xmath40 and @xmath41 forces are implemented , resulting in rotations around two orthogonal axis as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dipole_forces]*(c)*. in a trotter decomposition , the consecutive concatenation of these orthogonal infinitesimal displacements spoils the closed character of the trajectory . since the vibrations do not return to the initial state , the qubit and phonon states </S>",
    "<S> are generally entangled , and the gate becomes sensitive to thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this intuitive picture of the thermal noise is corroborated below by means of analytic and numerical arguments .    </S>",
    "<S> .*specific values of trapped - ion setup * [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ o_magnitude ]    for large detunings @xmath42 , the lasers only excite virtually the vibrational modes , and the phonons can be adiabatically eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is the process where a phonon is virtually created by an ion , and then reabsorbed by a distant one , which gives rise to the effective couplings @xmath43 which can be exploited to perform the phonon - mediated gates , or to implement a quantum simulation of the xy spin chain  @xcite . at certain instants of time </S>",
    "<S> , the unitary evolution corresponds to a swap gate  @xcite , which performs the logic operation @xmath44 while leaving the remaining states unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is an additional process ignored in the above explanation that spoils the performance of the gate , namely , the phonon might be reabsorbed by the same ion . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a residual spin - phonon coupling @xmath45 where @xmath46 . according to this expression </S>",
    "<S> , the ion resonance frequency fluctuates in time due to the collective motional dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be interpreted as a _ local thermal noise _ in the limit of many ions , where it leads to dephasing . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ swap_gate]*(a ) * , the critical effect of this term on the swap gate has been studied . </S>",
    "<S> we show the results of a numerical simulation of the time evolution under the full spin - phonon hamiltonian , and compare it to the effective idealized description  . as evidenced in this figure , the performance of the gate is severely modified by the thermal phonon ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the swapping probabilities only approach the effective description ( circles and squares ) for ground - state cooled ions . </S>",
    "<S> as the mean phonon number is increased , the oscillations get a stronger damping , and the generation of bell states at half the swap periods ( black arrows ) deteriorates .     </S>",
    "<S> ( squares ) , @xmath47 ( circles ) for the effective gate  , compared to the exact spin - phonon hamiltonian for a two - ion crystal with different mean phonon numbers @xmath48 ( solid lines ) . </S>",

    "<S> we represent the gate error and compare it to the fault - tolerance ( ft ) threshold @xmath55 . ]    _ achieving robustness against thermal noise. _ we now address the question of protecting the coherent spin dynamics from this thermal dephasing by switching @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> schematically , this may be accomplished by refocusing the effects of one of the spin - dependent forces using a series of spin - echo pulses that invert the atomic state  [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dipole_forces]*(d ) * ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the dynamics of the dephasing   is characterized by the difference between normal - mode frequencies , @xmath57 , and can thus be considered as a low - frequency noise . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , this noise is still much faster than the typical gate times , and simple spin - echo techniques  @xcite would not suffice to get rid of the thermal errors . instead of using complicated pulse sequences , we show below that the strong driving of the carrier transition @xmath58 implements a continuous version of the refocusing of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dipole_forces]*(d ) * , providing a viable and simple mechanism for overcoming this noise . as will become clear later on , this </S>",
    "<S> driving is not only responsible for the decoupling from the thermal noise , but it also minimizes the undesired errors due to ac - stark shifts and magnetic - field noise </S>",
    "<S> .    a helpful account of the decoupling mechanism may be the following . in the dressed - state basis of the driving @xmath59 , </S>",
    "<S> the residual spin - phonon coupling becomes @xmath60 for a strong driving strength @xmath13 , this term rotates very fast even for two vibrational modes that are close in frequency , and can be thus neglected in a rotating wave approximation . </S>",
    "<S> note that we have assumed a vanishing phase of the driving , but the same argument applies for any other stable phase  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this simple argument has to be readdressed for a combination of the carrier and red - sideband interactions  , since the residual couplings are no longer described by eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> in order to show that a similar argument can still be applied , we have performed a polaron - type transformation that allows us to find the effective interaction and residual error terms to any desired order of perturbation theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dynamics is accurately described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath61 whereas the residual spin - phonon coupling is given by @xmath62 such that @xmath63 by moving to the dressed - state basis , the residual term only involves transitions between the dressed eigenstates @xmath64 , supplemented by the transformation on the phonons encoded in the different powers of @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , all these transitions are inhibited due to the large energy gap between the dressed states set by @xmath13 . more precisely , in the strong driving regime </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 ( see table  [ o_magnitude ] ) , the leading order terms of the residual coupling   can be neglected in a rotating wave approximation .    to check the correctness of this argument </S>",
    "<S> , we integrate numerically the complete hamiltonian with both the sideband and the carrier terms  , and take into account the thermal motion of the trapped ions . </S>",
    "<S> after the unitary evolution @xmath67 , we calculate the fidelity of producing the bell state @xmath68 , @xmath69 for different initial thermal states and driving strengths . </S>",
    "<S> the results displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ swap_gate]*(b ) * demonstrate the promised decoupling from the thermal noise . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the fidelity of the gate improves considerably with respect to the non - driven case when the amplitude lies beyond @xmath70 . for driving strengths in the 4 - 5 mhz range , </S>",
    "<S> the gate error lies within the fault - tolerance threshold @xmath71  @xcite for states with mean phonon numbers @xmath72 ( see inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we emphasize that a lower fidelity should be expected when experimental imperfections are taken into account .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ decoupled_gate_scheme ] , we describe the experimental steps required to create the desired bell state . in the first step , </S>",
    "<S> the qubits are optically pumped to @xmath73 , and the initial state @xmath52 is prepared by a @xmath32-pulse @xmath74 obtained from a microwave resonant with the carrier transition ( blue ) . </S>",
    "<S> three comments are now in order . </S>",
    "<S> first , a magnetic field @xmath75 mt needs to be applied to ensure that the zeeman splitting between magnetic states is sufficiently large to avoid driving unwanted transitions . </S>",
    "<S> note that the motional excitation of the ions can be neglected when driving microwave transitions owing to the vanishing lamb - dicke factor . </S>",
    "<S> second , either the ac - stark shift from an off - resonant laser beam or a magnetic field gradient is required to effectively hide the second ion . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could use ion shuttling techniques  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> third , we account for the worst possible scenario by considering _ ( </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ different switching times of the lasers and microwaves , and _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ imperfect timing with the microwave . by introducing global @xmath32-pulses @xmath76 from the energy shift of an off - resonant strong microwave ( yellow ) , </S>",
    "<S> we refocus the fast oscillations caused by the resonant microwave and correct the possible difference of switching times . in the second step , the two - qubit coupling is applied at @xmath77 by switching on the laser beams responsible for the red sideband . </S>",
    "<S> again , a refocusing pulse at @xmath78 shall correct for the imperfect synchronization with the resonant microwave . </S>",
    "<S> let us stress that these pulses may not be required in the case of accurate synchronization . in the final step , after switching off the laser and microwaves at @xmath79 , the qubit state is measured by state - dependent fluorescence techniques . </S>",
    "<S> if the announced decoupling has worked correctly , this two - qubit gate should have generated the entangled bell state @xmath80 regardless of the phonon state . </S>",
    "<S> let us emphasize that this gate is capable of producing the remaining bell states by choosing different initial states  @xcite and , together with single - qubit rotations , becomes universal for quantum computation .    </S>",
    "<S> , followed by a local @xmath32-pulse @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the global @xmath32-pulses @xmath82 correct the possible synchronization errors . </S>",
    "<S> the two - qubit coupling is applied by switching on the laser beams responsible for the red - sideband ( red ) , and the microwaves that yield the noise decoupling ( blue ) . ]    _ resilience to magnetic - field noise and ac - stark shifts. _ so far , we have neglected the effects of the environment . in standard traps , </S>",
    "<S> the leading source of noise is due to environmental fluctuating magnetic fields , which limit the coherence times of magnetic - field sensitive states to milliseconds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly important for multi - ion entangled states experiencing super - decoherence  @xcite , and will also play a key role in our scheme considering that the two - qubit couplings lie in the @xmath83 khz regime . to study its consequences </S>",
    "<S> , we model the _ global magnetic - field noise _ by a fluctuating resonance frequency @xmath84 . here , @xmath85 is a stochastic markov process  @xcite characterized by a diffusion constant @xmath86 and a correlation time @xmath87 that determine the exponential decay of the coherences @xmath88 with @xmath89  @xcite . by fixing these parameters , we can reproduce the experimentally observed @xmath90ms [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ decoupled_gate]*(a ) * ] , and study its consequences on the two - qubit entangling gate . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the evolution within the zero - magnetization subspace is not affected by this global noise , which can be interpreted as a decoherence - free subspace . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we have studied the fidelity of generating a bell state that lies outside this subspace @xmath91 .    as shown below </S>",
    "<S> , the strong driving @xmath13 protects the qubit coherences from this magnetic noise without compromising the entangling gate , and may be considered as a continuous version  @xcite of the so - called dynamical decoupling  @xcite . to single out the effects of the noise from those of the thermal motion , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered a ground - state cooled crystal , setting @xmath92mhz to ensure that the results can be carried out to higher temperatures [ fig .  [ swap_gate]*(b ) * ] . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate numerically the fidelity of generating the bell state @xmath93 by averaging over different samplings of the random noise [ inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ decoupled_gate]*(b ) * ] . due to the decoupling , </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity approaches unity at the gate time @xmath94 ms . in the main panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ decoupled_gate]*(b ) * , we show that the gate error for shorter coherence times still lies below the fault - tolerance threshold , which demonstrates that the decoupling mechanism supports a stronger magnetic noise . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , this tells us that the gate tolerates smaller speeds , and thus lower rabi frequencies of the raman beams . </S>",
    "<S> this shall reduce even further the thermal error studied above , and the spontaneous scattering of photons due to the raman beam configuration in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dipole_forces]*(a)*. we have also calculated the fidelity of the quantum channel with respect to the desired quantum gate @xmath95  @xcite , which also lies within the fault - tolerance threshold .     for the initial states @xmath96 due to the magnetic dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> the blue circles represent the statistical average of the numerical integration of @xmath97 time evolutions , and the solid line represents the fit to an exponential decay . * </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) * error in the generation of the bell state @xmath98 from @xmath99 as predicted by the effective gate  . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - phonon hamiltonian incorporates the additional magnetic - field noise , together with a strong microwave driving @xmath92 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the error is presented as a function of the dephasing @xmath100 times . in the inset </S>",
    "<S> , we represent the time evolution of the fidelity for the typical noise dephasing time @xmath1015 ms . ]    as an additional advantage of our scheme , we note that it also minimizes the effects of uncompensated ac - stark shifts that may be caused by fluctuations of the laser intensities . in the derivation of the red - sideband hamiltonian  </S>",
    "<S> , we have neglected the carrier transition by imposing a weak rabi frequency of the laser beams . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the energy levels will be off - resonantly shifted due to an ac - stark effect . in a realistic implementation of the geometric phase gates , the shifts caused by off - resonant transitions to all possible states must be compensated by carefully selecting the laser intensities , frequencies , and polarizations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , fluctuations of these parameters will compromise this procedure introducing additional noise . in clear contrast , the effects of these energy shifts in our scheme are directly cancelled by the strong driving in the same way that the energy shifts caused by magnetic - field fluctuations have been minimized .    </S>",
    "<S> let us finally comment on the effect of phase instabilities on the gate . in analogy to the conditional phase gate  @xcite , but </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to mlmer - srensen ( ms ) gates  @xcite , our scheme does not depend on the slow drift of the laser phases . </S>",
    "<S> the second - order process , whereby a phonon is virtually excited and then reabsorbed , is associated to the creation and subsequent annihilation of photons in the same pair of raman beams , giving rise to the insensitivity to slow changes of the phase [ see eq .  ] . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the ms scheme involves two different pairs of raman beams , such that the cross talk leads to the phase sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our gate   only relies on the phase of the microwave , which is easier to stabilize as compared to the phase of the two pairs of raman beams in the ms scheme .    _ conclusions and outlook. _ we have introduced a scheme that merges the notion of continuous dynamical decoupling with warm quantum gates in trapped ions . </S>",
    "<S> the decoupling , on top of reducing effects of external magnetic field noise , is also responsible for the gate robustness with respect to thermal fluctuations and ac - stark shifts . </S>",
    "<S> the use of continuous dynamical decoupling , as opposed to pulse sequences , yields elegant schemes which are easier to analyze theoretically and realize experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the direction of combining quantum gates and dynamical decoupling is very promising .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we remark that our scheme can be applied to different ion species , and note that it could also be combined with a mlmer - srensen gate to protect it from magnetic field fluctuations and ac - stark shifts . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we emphasize that these ideas may find an application beyond the field of trapped ions . </S>",
    "<S> several quantum - information architectures also make use a bosonic data bus to couple distant qubits , whose coherence times are limited by the environment - induced dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> representative examples are trapped atoms in cavities , superconducting qubits coupled to transmission lines , color centers in nanodiamonds coupled to nanomechanical resonators , donor states in semiconductors coupled to phonons , or quantum dots coupled to excitons . </S>",
    "<S> the decoupling from the noise induced by either the environment or by the bosonic mediator can be achieved along the lines here discussed . </S>",
