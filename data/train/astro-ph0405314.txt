    "although interstellar extinction has been discussed in many papers and quantitatively determined by dedicated missions ( iue , 2mass and others ) , there is a lack of proper handling in the field of eclipsing binaries .",
    "the usually adopted approach is to calculate the amount of reddening from the observed object s coordinates and its inferred distance and to subtract it uniformly , regardless of phase , from photometric observations .",
    "this paper shows why this approach may be inadequate , especially for objects where interstellar extinction and the color difference between both components are significant .",
    "atmospheric extinction is a better - posed problem : similarly as interstellar extinction depends on @xmath4 , atmospheric extinction depends on air - mass , which is a measurable quantity , whereas @xmath4 has to be estimated .",
    "to estimate the effect of reddening on eclipsing binaries , we built a synthetic binary star model , consisting of two main sequence g9",
    "f5  v stars with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and 1 day orbital period .",
    "the simulation logic is as follows : for the given phase , we calculate the effective spectrum of the binary by convolving doppler - shifted individual spectra of the visible surfaces of both components . to this intrinsic spectrum",
    "we rigorously apply interstellar and atmospheric extinctions ( both as functions of wavelength ) .",
    "we then convolve this reddened spectrum with instrumental response function ( composed of the filter transmittivity and detector response functions ) and integrate over the bandpass wavelength range to obtain the flux .",
    "in contrast , we use the same intrinsic spectrum without rigorously applying the reddening . to simulate the subtraction of a reddening",
    "_ constant _ from photometric observations , we simply divide the intrinsic spectrum by the flux that corresponds to this constant .",
    "finally , we calculate the flux in the same manner as before and compare it to the flux obtained by applying rigorous reddening .    for building synthetic light curves we use phoebe ( pra & zwitter , 2004 ; in preparation ) .",
    "each light curve consists of 300 points uniformly distributed over the whole orbital phase range . to be able to evaluate the impact of reddening on photometric light curves exclusively ,",
    "all second - order effects ( limb darkening , gravity brightening , reflection effect ) have been turned off .",

    "the used @xmath10 response data ( filter @xmath11 detector ) are taken from adps @xcite , where we apply a cubic spline fit to obtain the instrumental response function .    for interstellar extinction",
    ", we use the empirical formula ( fig .",
    "[ redlaw ] ) , where @xmath12 was assumed throughout this study .",
    "interstellar dust catalog was used to obtain the maximum color excess @xmath13 values for different lines of sight .",
    "for atmospheric extinction we use the equation triplet for rayleigh - ozone - aerosol extrinction sources given by and summarized by .",
    "the observatory altitude @xmath14  km and the zenith air - mass are assumed throughout the study .    to rigorously deredden the observations for the given @xmath15 and @xmath13",
    ", it is necessary to determine the reddening for each wavelength of the spectrum . correcting differentially and integrating over the filter bandpass then yields the dereddened flux of the given filter .",
    "however , without spectral observations , it is difficult to calculate properly the flux correction .",
    "since formula depends on the wavelength , the usually adopted approach found in literature is to use the effective wavelength @xmath16 of the filter transmittivity curve to calculate the reddening correction .",

    "since the flux is the integral over the filter bandpass , @xmath16 has a _ conceptually _ different meaning .",
    "furthermore , @xmath16 of the given filter depends heavily on the effective temperature of the observed object and on the color excess @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ weff ] ) . to determine the subtraction constant",
    ", one has to make sure that _ the integral _ ( rather than any particular wavelength ) of the both curves is the same .",
    "[ discrepancy ] shows the discrepancy between the properly calculated light curve and the one obtained by subtracting a @xmath16-calculated constant .",
    "table [ analysis ] summarizes the differences between the proper treatment and other approaches . *",
    "2 ) * even if the subtraction constant is properly calculated , the light curves still exhibit measurable differences in both minima ( figs .",
    "[ discrepancy ] , [ minima ] ) .",
    "this is due to the effective temperature change of the binary system during eclipses . for the analysed case , the difference in b magnitude is @xmath2mag , which is generally observable .",
    "* 3 ) * if light curves in three or more photometric filters are available , it is possible to _ uniquely _ determine the color excess value @xmath13 by comparing different color indices in - and - out of eclipse .",

    "@xmath18 is the value of extinction in b filter and @xmath19 is the deviation from the rigorously calculated value .",
    "all values are calculated for @xmath17 at quarter phase .",
    "note that @xmath18 is smaller than @xmath20 , since our simulated binary is cooler than 10000k .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      atmospheric extinction is comprised of three different sources : the rayleigh scattering , the aerosol scattering and ozone absorption @xcite .",
    "it depends on the wavelength of the observed light and on the air - mass of obsevations , which is of course the same for both binary components ; we are thus left only with wavelength dependence at some inferred air - mass . to assess the impact on the photometric data , we compare the flux change imposed on the intrinsic spectrum by reddening and by atmospheric extinction ( fig .",
    "[ atmosphere ] ) .",
    "we conclude that for weakly and moderately reddened eclipsing binaries the atmospheric extinction dominates the blue parts of the spectrum due to rayleigh scattering , but for larger color excesses ( @xmath21 ) the reddening is dominant throughout the spectrum .",
    "by not properly taking reddening into account , we introduce systematics of @xmath2mag into the solution for our simulated binary .",
    "one may ask : is this difference worth bothering with ? to demonstrate that it is , let us simulate a bit more exotic eclipsing binary with blue b8 main - sequence ( @xmath22k , @xmath23 ) and red k4 type iii giant ( @xmath24k , @xmath25 ) components with orbital period of 15 days . fig .",
    "[ minima ] ( right ) shows that the discrepancy between the rigorously calculated light curve and the constant - subtracted one is as large as @xmath3mag , which means @xmath26% error in the determined distance to the observed object . on the other hand ,",
    "the reddening effect may be reduced by using narrower filter - sets , e.g.  strmgren _ ubvy _ set .",
    "furthermore , typical observed color excesses rarely exceed few tenths of the magnitude , which additionally diminishes this effect",
    ". however , future space scanning missions such as gaia @xcite will acquire measurements of eclipsing binaries without spatial bias .",
    "thus interstellar extinction should be carefully and rigorously introduced into the reduction pipeline for eclipsing binaries ."
