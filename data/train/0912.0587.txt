    "any system in the realistic world is open since it inevitably interacts with its environment .",
    "the time evolutions of open systems are simply classified into markovian and non - markovian ones according to the ways to lose energy or information  @xcite . in most situations ,",
    "markovian process uniquely determines its final steady state as an thermal equilibrium  @xcite , which is independent of its initial one . in this sense",
    "a markovian process is essentially an information erasure process , thus tends to continuously reduce the distinguishability between any two initial states  @xcite .",
    "however , markovian description for an open quantum system is only an approximation to most of realistic processes , which are of non - markovian . with many recent investigations about non - markovian dynamics by making use of various analytical approaches and numerical simulations , a computable measure of `` markovianity '' for quantum channels",
    "was introduced in ref .",
    "most recently , it was also recognized that difference between them can be measured through the continuous increment of the state distinguishability  @xcite .",
    "then this increment is intuitively interpreted as the revival of information flow between the bath and the system though there no quantitative information measure is utilized .",
    "based on this measure of the non - markovianity , a method for direct measurement of the non - markovian character was proposed  @xcite .",
    "another approach based on entanglement is proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper , the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) flow are introduced to directly characterize the non - markovianity of the quantum dynamics of open systems .",
    "actually , in the system - plus - bath approach for open quantum systems , the effective dynamics of the reduced density matrix @xmath0 is induced by tracing over environment  @xcite .",
    "the simplest reduced dynamics is the quantum markovian process described by dynamical semigroups  alickibook .",
    "there , the reduced density matrix @xmath0 at time @xmath1 is determined completely by the one at time @xmath2 .",
    "contrarily , the general reduced dynamics may be of non - markovian when the surrounding environment may retain a memory of the information about states at earlier times , and transfer it back to the system to affect its evolution . in this sense",
    "the markovian process only happens when the environmental correlation time is relatively short so that memory effects can be neglected .",
    "these memory - based considerations for the markovian approximation also mean that the information - theoretical characterizing of the non - markovianity is a quite natural fashion . however , it is still an open question that how to treat the information flow in open quantum systems based on a solid information - theoretic foundation .    in this paper",
    ", we establish such a framework by adopting the qfi flow as the quantitative measure for the information flow .",
    "the qfi characterizes the statistical distinguishability of reduced density matrix  @xcite .",
    "an intuitive picture of the memory effect of a non - markovian behavior then immediately follows from the dynamic return of the qfi , which is depicted by the inward qfi flow . for a class of the non - markovian master equations in time - local forms",
    ", we exactly calculate the information flows .",
    "the analytic results show that the total qfi flow can be decomposed into the split contributions from different dissipative channels for each fixed time . on the other hand",
    ", the qfi plays an essential role in quantum metrology  @xcite , where the highest precision of estimating an unknown parameter we may achieve is related to inverse of the qfi .",
    "we point out this qfi flow approach is feasible to work for understanding the problems of quantum metrology .",
    "we consider the quantum processes described by the following time - local master equation  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a super - operator acting on the reduced density matrix @xmath5 as  @xcite @xmath6+\\sum_{i}\\gamma_{i}\\left[a_{i}\\rho a_{i}^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { a_{i}^{\\dagger}a_{i},\\rho\\right\\ } \\right ] , \\label{eq : k_t_form}\\ ] ] with @xmath7 the hermitian hamiltonian for the open quantum system without the couplings to the bath .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the anti - commutator .",
    "if all @xmath9 and @xmath10 are time independent , and all @xmath9 are positive , equation ( [ eq : k_t_form ] ) is the conventional master equation of the lindblad form  @xcite , which describes the conventional markovian process . however , by making use of a variety of methods , such as the time - convolutionless projection operator technique  @xcite , feynman - vervon influence functional theory  fvmethod and some others  @xcite , the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the time - local master equation may explicitly depend on time , and @xmath9 even may become negative sometimes . obviously , the non - markovian character resides in these time - dependent coefficients .    taking some real number @xmath13 in the reduced density matrix @xmath14 as the inference parameter , we write down the qfi  estimationbook @xmath15 , \\label{eq : qfi}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the so - called symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) , which are hermitian operators determined by  @xcite @xmath17 .",
    "\\label{eq : sld}\\ ] ] an important essential feature of the qfi is that we can obtain the achievable lower bound of the mean - square error of unbiased estimators for the parameter @xmath13 through the quantum cramr - rao ( qcr ) theorem @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the times of the independent measurements  @xcite . from the qcr theorem",
    ", we can see that the qfi is indeed a measure of a certain kind of information with respect to the precision of estimating the inference parameter .",

    "( [ eq : qfi ] ) with respect to time @xmath2 , we obtain the qfi flow as @xmath26 ,   \\label{eq : di}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath27 is defined . by using the concrete expression of the master equation  ( [ eq : k_t_form ] )",
    ", we split the qfi flow into those individuals corresponding to the different dissipative channels as @xmath28 $ ] or @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "after some algebra , we get the decomposition @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is just given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pro ] ) .",
    "it finally proves the proposition .",
    "the above proposition and its proof contain rich implications in physics .",
    "firstly , the decomposition of the qfi flow corresponding to the different dissipative channels is due to the linearity of qfi flow equation  ( eq : di ) with respect to @xmath32 and the concrete form of the time - local master equation  ( [ eq : k_t_form ] ) .",
    "this is not a simple decomposition since each subflow depends on the whole sld @xmath16 , meanwhile , @xmath16 is deduced from @xmath33 whose evolution depends on every dissipative channel and the unitary part of the master equation .",
    "so this kind of decomposition does not mean different dissipative channels are separable to influence the change of the qfi for a period of time .",
    "however , for each fixed time @xmath34 , the qfi flow at the present moment are decomposed into the split contributions from different dissipative channels . in this sense",
    ", we interpret @xmath35 as a subflow of the qfi at time @xmath2 caused by the dissipative channel described by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the magnitude of the qfi subflow is determined by a state - independent factor @xmath9 and a state - dependent factor @xmath31 .",
    "secondly , one of the advantages of such decomposition comes from the link between the direction of each qfi subflow @xmath38 and the sign of the decay rate @xmath9 . because @xmath31 is non - positive",
    ", we conclude that a negative @xmath37 implies an inward qfi subflow ( @xmath39 ) , except the trivial case of @xmath40 .",
    "the temporary appearance of negative decay rates is already considered as the essential feature of the non - markovian behaviors  @xcite , here this is justified through the return of the qfi . for the case that all @xmath41 are positive",
    ", the master equation ( [ eq : k_t_form ] ) describes a so - called time - dependent markovian quantum process  wonderen2000,maniscalco2004,wolf2008,breuer2004 , in which cases , @xmath42 always decreases .",
    "if the total qfi flow @xmath43 is positive at time @xmath2 , it signifies at least one of @xmath37 is negative . in such cases ,",
    "the qfi flows back to the open system and the non - markovian behavior emerges .    actually , like the trace distance used in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dynamical return of the qfi is linked to the divisibility property of the dynamical map of quantum processes .",
    "if the master equation is of the form ( [ eq : k_t_form ] ) , the corresponding dynamical map is infinitely divisible provided that all @xmath9 are positive  @xcite . in such cases , for arbitrary time @xmath34 , the dynamical map from time @xmath2 to @xmath1 is a completely positive and trace - preserving map .",
    "thus the qfi decreases during this time interval since the qfi is monotonic with respect to a completely positive and trace - preserving map  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , there should be some restriction on the evolution of the qfi .",
    "it is seen from the above proof of the proposition that the coherent part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : k_t_form ] ) , i.e. @xmath44 $ ] , does not contribute to the total qfi flow directly .",
    "this observation directly leads to the no - cloning theorem in quantum information , which states that we can not use unitary operations to evolve the states @xmath45 into @xmath46 as a quantum copy  @xcite .",
    "this is because the qfi of the target states is twice as the one of the source states , due to the additivity of the qfi for the product states .",
    "besides , if the total system ( system plus environment ) is assumed closed and the qfi is only distributed in the system initially , then the qfi of the reduced density matrix during evolution should be not greater than the one at the initial time , for the invariance of the qfi under unitary evolution and the non - increasing of the qfi under partial trace operation .",
    "this restriction should be reflected in the qfi flow obtained from a proper master equation .     in an unitary operation .",
    "after the phase gate operation , the system interacts with a reservoir .",
    "the precision of the estimation is impacted by characteristics of both the reservoir and the interaction . ]",
    "now we use an example of two - level system ( qubit ) to explicitly illustrate our discovery about the intrinsic relation between the qfi flow and the non - markovianity of the open quantum system and its impaction to parameter estimation . in the quantum metrology context",
    ", the qfi gives a theoretical - achievable limit on the precision when estimating an unknown parameter , according to the qcr theorem ( [ eq : qcr ] ) . to estimate the parameter as precisely as possible ,",
    "we should optimize input states to maximize the qfi , and then optimize measurements to achieve the cramr - rao bound  giovannetti2006 .",
    "however , due to the interaction with environment , the qfi will change and affect the precision of the parameter estimation .    here",
    ", the qfi - based parameter is assumed to be induced by a single - qubit phase gate @xmath47 acting on the qubit , where @xmath48 is some inference parameters ( see fig .  1 ) . to estimate the unknown parameter @xmath49 as precisely as possible",
    ", the optimal input state may be chosen as @xmath50 , which maximizes the qfi of the output state @xmath51 , see ref .",
    "giovannetti2006 . in the following model ,",
    "after the phase gate operation and before the measurement performed , the qubit is assumed as an atom coupled to a reservoir consisting of harmonic oscillators in the vacuum .",
    "the total hamiltonian of this typical model  breuerbook , garraway1997,bellomo2007 reads @xmath52with @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the transition frequency of the atom with ground and excited states @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are respectively the creating and annihilation operators of the bath mode of frequencies @xmath58 . @xmath59 denote the coupling constants . then we consider lorentzian spectral density @xmath60\\}$ ] , where @xmath61 is the transition strength , and @xmath62 defines the spectral width of the coupling , which is related to the reservoir correlation time scale @xmath63 by @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "the lorentzian spectral density describe the reservoir composed of lossy cavity , see ref .",

    "[ fig : djc ] ( d ) , which displays the non - markovianity .",

    "it is remarkable that although @xmath83 diverges at certain time , the qfi flow does not , see figs .",
    "[ fig : djc ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "this is because the qfi flow is determined by two factors , @xmath83 and @xmath85 .",
    "in summary , based on the qfi flow , we have proposed an information - theoretical approach for characterizing the time - dependent memory effect of environment for its surrounding open quantum systems . in this approach",
    "the markovian process is considered as a qfi erasure process , and the return of the qfi , i.e. an inward qfi flow , clearly signatures the non - markovian process . using the time - local master equations ,",
    "we have showed that for each fixed time @xmath34 the qfi flow is decomposable according to different dissipative channels , and the direction of each sub - flow is determined by the sign of decay rates . with this decomposition form , the relationship between the temporary appearance of negative decay rate and the non - markovian characteristic is justified .",
    "although in the present work , the analysis of the qfi flow is based on a time - local master equation , the concept of the qfi flow may be still available in more general cases .",
