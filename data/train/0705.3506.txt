    "these states are , with regards to entanglement , particularly robust against particle loss @xcite , and they are significant for the study and application of genuine multipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "photonic systems have proven fruitful for the experimental preparation and detection of three - photon polarization - entangled @xmath14 states ( dicke states with one `` excitation '' ) @xcite and , very recently , four - photon polarization - entangled dicke states with two excitations @xcite . meanwhile ,",

    "atomic @xmath14 states  have been produced in many - atom ensembles @xcite and with small collections of trapped ions @xcite .",
    "the potentially long coherence times of ground electronic states of atoms ( two of which constitute the qubit ) make atomic systems particularly attractive for the storage and manipulation of entangled states , and a variety of schemes have been proposed for the preparation of more general dicke states of trapped atoms or ions @xcite .    here",
    "we describe a system that adds to these proposed schemes , in that it may produce collective atomic states with multiple excitations , but also yields very interesting `` entangled - state dynamics '' and conditional quantum evolution , based upon photon detection in the output field of an optical cavity containing the atoms .",
    "the cavity qed setup and excitation scheme that we employ have been considered previously in the context of generating , in steady state , two - qubit ( i.e. , two - atom ) entangled mixed states of any allowed combination of purity and entanglement @xcite , although here we consider a specific limiting case of the operating conditions ( not considered in @xcite ) that does not in fact admit a unique steady state .    in examining this specific case",

    "furthermore , for @xmath15 more than one distinct switching cycle is possible , with the different cycles distinguished by the rate of photon emissions .",
    "we start in section [ quanttrajs ] with a brief review of the cavity qed configuration proposed in @xcite , after which we formulate our quantum trajectory model , making use of a convenient change of basis , which is motivated by the particular form of the effective hamiltonian and jump operators . in section [ steadystate ]",

    "such an excitation scheme could be achieved , for example , by using orthogonal , linearly - polarized laser and cavity fields on an @xmath27 atomic transition ( as in @xmath28 ) , or on an @xmath29 transition ( as in @xmath30 ) with an applied magnetic field , as described in @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the spacings between the atoms are assumed to be sufficiently large that direct dipole - dipole interactions can be neglected .",

    ", light shifts of the atomic ground states are balanced , such that raman resonance is maintained ; see @xcite for details ) , this master equation can be written in the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the atomic density matrix , @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for @xmath45 , the dynamics of ( [ mastereq1 ] ) produces unique steady states that are non - maximally - entangled ( pure or mixed ) collective spin states @xcite . however , for the remainder of this paper we consider the case @xmath46 for which ( [ mastereq1 ] ) does not admit a unique steady state ( mathematically , the system of linear equations for the density matrix elements possesses a second zero eigenvalue when @xmath47 ) . scaling time by @xmath48 , the master equation we thus focus on takes the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the @xmath51-component of the total pseudo - spin @xmath52 of all @xmath0 qubits . note",
    "that since @xmath53 commutes with @xmath54 , the dynamics described by ( [ mastereq2a ] ) conserves the magnitude of the total spin angular momentum ( which we will take to be the maximal value in this work ) @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the time - dependent behavior of the atomic state subject to dynamics as described by ( [ mastereq2a ] ) and , as depicted in fig .  [ physsys](b ) , in photon counting measurements on the cavity output field .",
    "the method of quantum trajectories ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , summarized briefly in the appendix , lends itself nicely to this task .    in this approach , and with photon counting measurements in mind , we rewrite ( [ mastereq2a ] ) in the form @xmath55 and identify a non - hermitian effective hamiltonian , @xmath56 , and collapse operator , @xmath57 , as @xmath58 in the trajectory model , free evolution of the atomic wave function , subject to @xmath56 , is interspersed , at random times , with collapses ( or quantum jumps ) produced by the action of @xmath57 on the wave function .",
    "these collapses can be identified with photon detections in the cavity output field and the resulting wave function trajectory describes the state of the atomic spin system conditioned upon the sequence of photon detections .    given the form of both @xmath56 and @xmath57 , a particularly convenient basis for our study will be the basis of eigenstates of the @xmath51-component of the total spin @xmath52 ; more precisely , simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath59 and @xmath54 . in the more familiar representation of simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which we denote by @xmath61 ,",
    "the allowed values of the @xmath62-component are @xmath63 , where , for a system of @xmath0 effective spin-1/2 particles , as we consider here , @xmath64 may take one of the values @xmath65 .",
    "so , for example , for @xmath66 atoms and @xmath67 ,    @xmath68    while for @xmath69 ( both spins `` up '' or `` down '' ) @xmath70    where @xmath71 @xmath72 denotes the state with atom 1 in state @xmath73 and atom 2 in state @xmath74",
    ".    to obtain the eigenstates of @xmath75 , we perform the appropriate set of euler rotations on the coordinate system .",

    "this result shows explicitly that the @xmath67 component of the spin wave function in the @xmath54-eigenstate basis is unaffected by the free evolution , while the amplitudes of the @xmath91 components decay exponentially with time .",
    "conversely , the @xmath67 component is completely removed by the action of the jump operator , i.e. , @xmath92 , while @xmath93 for odd @xmath0 , there is no @xmath67 component and the ( unnormalized ) wave function takes the form @xmath94 after a time @xmath84 of free evolution ( from the initial state @xmath83 ) .",
    "hence , all components of the wave function have amplitudes that decay exponentially .",
    "now , in the trajectory formalism , the square of the norm of the wave function , @xmath95 , can be identified as the probability for a collapse ( i.e. , a photon detection ) _ not to have happened _ . from this identification and our observations",
    "above , it follows that the system under investigation can exhibit very distinct behaviors , as we detail in the following two sections .",

    "this is a dicke state , in the basis of @xmath54-eigenstates , with @xmath2 excitations , which , as mentioned in the introduction , is of particular interest in the context of multipartite quantum entanglement .",
    "in fact , for our system a necessary and sufficient condition for genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement is @xcite @xmath98 which is `` optimally '' satisfied for the state @xmath96 , for which @xmath99 .",
    "note that with a standard unitary rotation , implemented for example using coherent laser raman pulses , this state can be transformed into the corresponding state @xmath100 in the ( conventional ) @xmath62-eigenstate basis .",

    "[ pjmx0 ] .",
    "it must be emphasized that in the case that the state @xmath96 is prepared , no photons are emitted from the cavity . with a probability @xmath106 there _ is _ a collapse , or photon detection .",
    "this in fact initiates a sustained sequence of collapses ( and photon detections ) , since the amplitudes of all of the remaining ( @xmath91 ) components of the wave function decay exponentially under free evolution , i.e. , the norm of the wave function is now guaranteed to decay towards zero , meaning that a collapse is also guaranteed to occur .",
    "hence , the system exhibits a distinctly bimodal behavior : either no photons are detected , `` signalling '' preparation of the state @xmath96 , or a continuous stream of photons is detected .",
    "while this stream of photons indicates failure in the preparation of a steady state , it also signals the initiation of some remarkable dynamics of the system , which we label _ entangled state cycles _ and examine in the next section .     for preparation of the dicke state @xmath96 versus @xmath2 ( @xmath0 even ) .",

    "the rate of photon detections is proportional to the expectation value of the operator @xmath110 , and hence to the value @xmath111 .",
    "the photon detection configuration we consider can therefore be interpreted as providing a measurement of @xmath111 , so we can expect each trajectory to `` converge '' towards a particular pair of states , @xmath109 ( or possibly to the state @xmath96 for even @xmath0 ) , conditioned upon the measurement record .",
    "for example , from ( [ jumps ] ) we see that collapses increase the amplitude @xmath112 relative to @xmath113 , while from ( [ evo ] ) , we see that free evolution decreases @xmath112 exponentially relative to @xmath113 . hence , within a given time interval , the more photon detections that occur , the more probable it is for the state to converge towards states @xmath109 with larger @xmath5 ( for which , of course , a higher photon count rate is also expected ) . in contrast , the longer @xmath114 evolves without a collapse the more likely it is for the state to converge towards states @xmath109 with lower values of @xmath5 .",
    "which state or pair of states ( @xmath96 or @xmath109 ) is `` selected '' in a particular trajectory is random . in the case of @xmath109",
    ", the sequence of photon detections corresponds to a sequence of jumps , described by ( [ jumps ] ) , between the states @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "these states are also very interesting entangled states , and we label the system s behavior in this instance as an _ entangled - state cycle_. we now look at specific examples of entangled state cycles for @xmath16 .",
    "consider free evolution of the initial state @xmath118 from @xmath119 up to time @xmath84 , without any collapses having occurred .",
    "the normalized wave function is given by @xmath120 this illustrates very clearly that as time progresses and no collapses occur ( i.e. , no photons are detected ) , the more likely it is for the system to be in the state @xmath121 .",
    "such a no - collapse trajectory ( an example of which is shown in fig .",

    "such a cycle is illustrated in fig .",

    "in essence , the trajectory formalism reduces the problem of mixed - state evolution to that of a pure state , as we describe below .",
    "references @xcite provide an excellent account of the formalism .    for our quantum trajectory approach ,",
    "the output of the optical cavity is considered to be monitored continuously by photon counting , as shown in fig .",
    "[ physsys](b ) . in this scenario",
    ", each photodetection sequence corresponds to a trajectory of the @xmath0-qubit collective atomic state .",
    "consider a normalized pure state @xmath174 at time @xmath84 .",
    "the state is evolved `` freely '' over a small ( ideally infinitesimal ) time increment @xmath175 according to @xmath176 where @xmath56 is a non - hermitian effective hamiltonian and the state is renormalized after the non - unitary evolution @xcite .",
    "such free evolution is interspersed , at random times , with `` quantum jumps '' or `` collapses '' , the probability of which must be calculated at each timestep . in particular , the probability that a collapse of the state occurs over the ( infinitesimal ) time step @xmath175 is given by @xmath177 where @xmath57 is the collapse operator . to determine whether a collapse occurs or not , a uniformly distributed random number @xmath178 is drawn from the unit interval @xmath179 $ ] and compared to @xmath180 . if @xmath181 then the state becomes @xmath182 otherwise , for @xmath183 , the state is not collapsed and it continues to evolve , according to ( [ nonhermite ] ) , over another subsequent interval of @xmath175 .",
    "this process is iterated over sufficiently many time steps to build up a trajectory .",
    "note that for our system the action of @xmath57 represents the emission and subsequent detection of a photon in the cavity output field .",
