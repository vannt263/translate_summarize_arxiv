    "cloud formation in cool atmospheres is a key characteristic of planetary , exoplanetary , and brown dwarf atmospheres @xcite .",
    "we know from the study of isolated , self - luminous , field brown dwarfs that these clouds will typically not be completely uniform , but instead can have both vertical and horizontal structure , and vary in time .",
    "synoptic monitoring of objects with patchy clouds is a powerful tool to study such objects because each observation samples different regions of the surface as the target rotates .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring of brown dwarfs with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) has detected wavelength dependent phase shifts in light curve features @xcite , best interpreted as due to molecules condensing at different pressure levels within the atmosphere and cloud structures in the vertical as well as horizontal @xcite , including in some cases the presence of a low pressure haze layer @xcite .",
    "the chemistry of the clouds varies with the temperature of the brown dwarf photosphere , from the warmest condensates ( e.g. , various oxides of magnesium and calcium ) at @xmath2 @xmath1 2500k to water clouds for the coolest brown dwarfs @xcite . using the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite to obtain mid - infrared time series photometry , @xcite found that discrete cloud spots are present in most l and t - type brown dwarfs , typically producing variability in the range 0.2% to 5% .",
    "even higher amplitude variability is a characteristic of the l / t transition @xcite where cloud properties change dramatically in a narrow temperature range .",
    "cloud lifetimes apparently vary from hours @xcite to years in some cases @xcite . @xcite found that a @xmath3k y dwarf was variable at the 3.5% level , with the clouds changing in the months between observing epochs .",
    "extending this work to planetary - mass objects orbiting brighter primaries is challenging , but cloud variability in 2m1207b has been detected @xcite and the hr 8799 planets are being monitored @xcite .",
    "extensive studies of this nature likely must await the james webb space telescope or other future technologies .",
    "however , extending this work to the gas giants of the solar system is possible now . and , while the surfaces of brown dwarfs and exoplanets can not be spatially resolved , imaging of the gas giants in the solar system is possible and can provide ground truth for inferences drawn from synoptic monitoring .",
    "therefore , synoptic monitoring observations of solar system planets as  point sources \" provide a useful comparison to these brown dwarf and exoplanet results , as well as offering new insights into weather on the planets themselves .",
    "although there is an exceptional long - term optical @xmath4 and @xmath5 band photometric sequence for neptune @xcite exhibiting variations in reflected light of a few percent over time , until fairly recently there has been little in the way of intensive , short term photometric monitoring of solar system giant planets reported in the literature .",
    "most recently @xcite monitored neptune over about one rotation period in 1996 from hst and measured variability as large as 22% at wavelengths with strong methane absorption .",
    "they attributed the variability to patchy , high altitude clouds .",
    "much longer term cloud morphology changes for neptune  over years  can be found in @xcite and @xcite , who report that near - infrared high resolution imaging detects significant cloud evolution between 2009 and 2013 .    the repurposed kepler / k2 mission",
    "@xcite notably altered the status quo by providing the opportunity to obtain a continuous , months - long lightcurve of neptune in a single broad optical band ( 0.43 @xmath0 m to 0.90@xmath0 m ) .",
    "neptune was observed by k2 in late 2014 at a one - minute cadence for 49 days ( rowe et  al .",
    "2016 , in prep ) .",
    "this k2 broadband optical light curve of neptune is sensitive to light reflected from the planet and not thermal emission from the atmosphere .",
    "thus the measured time - varying lightcurve is particularly sensitive to the scattering properties and altitudes of clouds within the atmosphere and the relative altitude of the clouds compared to other sources of atmospheric opacity , primarily methane absorption .",
    "@xcite analyzed the cloud contributions to the complex neptune k2 light curve .",
    "the light curve has an amplitude of @xmath6 and is dominated by discrete cloud features which are more ( or less ) reflective than the global cloud deck .",
    "because of neptune s latitude - dependent high winds , periods from 15 to 19 hours are detected instead of a single rotation period .",
    "the most significant periodic ( @xmath7 hrs ) signal is attributed to a single , long - lived stable feature at a latitude of 45 s. this bright cloud was confirmed by contemporaneous near - infrared keck adaptive optics imaging and later hst optical imaging .",
    "contributions from smaller , rapidly evolving discrete clouds add irregularities to the dominant signal .    at jupiter ,",
    "the transition from reflected sunlight dominating the disk - averaged emission to thermal emission takes place around @xmath8 .",
    "the planet s famed five - micron hot spots , for example , are regions of thermal emission from the deep atmosphere pouring out through holes in the water and ammonia cloud decks in a region of low gas opacity .",
    "large horizontal inhomogeneity at @xmath9 corresponds to variability in the tropospheric weather layer . at the much colder uranus and neptune",
    ", the transition from scattered to emitted light takes place at longer wavelengths , at about 6 to @xmath10 , and the thermal emission originates from the higher - altitude , radiatively controlled stratosphere .",
    "examples of ice giant variability studies at thermal wavelengths include the work of @xcite who detected a bright polar region at 7.7 and 11.7 @xmath0 m in neptune , and showed that these stratospheric ethane and methane emission features are uncorrelated with the deeper cloud features observed in near - infrared imaging .",
    "based on independent , mid - ir ground - based imaging , @xcite detected a distinct rotating hot spot in ethane and methane emission ; @xcite showed that this feature has been absent in some years and may be a wave feature excited by dynamics lower in the atmosphere .    in this paper",
    ", we provide the first well - sampled mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) light curves for neptune based on thirty - five hours of continuous monitoring in early 2016 with _",
    "spitzer_. we also provide six sparsely sampled mid - ir light curves of neptune obtained in 2010 through 2015 with the wide - field infrared survey explorer satellite . while these light curves are also sensitive to reflected light , they probe different depths into neptune s cloudy atmosphere than those obtained previously with k2 and hst .",
    "our data thereby add new constraints on the composition and structure or neptune s cloud deck .",
    "section 2 describes the various sources of data we use ;  3 and  4 describe in detail the analysis steps used to construct the _ spitzer _ and _ wise _ light curves .",
    "section 5 compares the infrared light curves to those obtained at shorter wavelengths and the initial inferences we draw from these comparisons .",
    "neptune was observed between ut 2016 february 21 - 23 in both of the 3.6 @xmath0 m ( irac-1 ) and 4.5 @xmath0 m ( irac-2 ) channels of the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on _ spitzer_. the measurements were part of director s discretionary time program 12125 ( pi : stauffer ) .",
    "the time period was chosen expressly because neptune as seen from _",
    "was near the stationary point in its orbit , thus minimizing the planet s motion during the many hour observation and thereby minimizing any possible time - varying contamination from background field stars that would pass through the neptune or sky aperture for the photometry .",
    "the astronomical observation requests ( aors ) were made in irac s staring mode , where for each channel , the spacecraft is maneuvered so that the target is placed on the well - calibrated peak - up pixel and back - to - back frames taken for the total time of the aor with no dithering .",
    "for each channel , the total duration of the aor was set to cover a complete rotation of neptune , or about 17.2 hours . in channel 1 ( 3.6 @xmath0 m ) , frames with times of 100 seconds were used ( corresponding to 96.8 second exposure times ) , resulting in 622 images ; in channel 2 ( 4.5@xmath11 m ) , a frametime of 30 seconds was used ( corresponding to 26.8 sec exposure times ) , resulting in 2018 images .",
    "the image files were dark - subtracted , linearized , flat - fielded , and calibrated using the s19.2 version of the irac pipeline .",
    "we had requested that the channel 2 observations be made immediately following the channel 1 observations , but a time -critical exoplanet transit observation was inserted between the two neptune aors , resulting in the channel 2 light curve beginning about 2.3 days after the start of the channel 1 observation .",
    "flux densities were measured with aperture photometry on the _ spitzer _ basic calibrated data ( bcd ) images .",
    "after first determining the center of neptune via a `` center of light '' technique @xcite , the flux was integrated over a 5 pixel radius aperture using the idl astronomy user s library routine aper.pro .",
    "the per - pixel average background was derived for each image using an annulus centered on neptune with inner and outer radii of ( 16,18 ) pixels .",
    "this per - pixel bias was scaled to the aperture area and subtracted from the integrated flux .",
    "normally , a tighter annulus is used to derive the background for point source photometry but avoiding triton and a background star required a minimum radius of 16 pixels .",
    "we corrected the fluxes for losses due to a finite aperture size by multiplying by the aperture corrections : 1.049 at 3.6 @xmath0 m and 1.050 at 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "these corrections were derived for point source observations with post - cryogenic irac for an aperture of 5 pixels radius and a background annulus of ( 10,20 ) pixels .",
    "simulations with the irac point response function ( prf ) show that using a nonstandard ( 16,18 ) background annulus changes the flux by only 0.2% compared to the ( 10,20 ) annulus .",
    "however , these aperture corrections were not optimized for non - point objects ( neptune s angular diameter from earth ranges from 2@xmath1217 to 2@xmath1237 , whereas the irac point spread function ( psf ) at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m is about 1@xmath128 fwhm ) . we expect therefore some unaccounted - for aperture losses which do not affect relative flux estimates .",
    "additional losses due to the under - sampled psf and a variable spatial response of each pixel ( the so - called `` pixel - phase effect '' ) , _ can _ affect relative flux variations when coupled with normal spacecraft pointing fluctuations .",
    "however , the magnitude of this effect is only a few percent ( about one tick mark in figure [ fig : spitzerlc ] ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for point sources and less for partially resolved sources like neptune , and so we did not attempt to correct for it here .",
    "we converted aperture fluxes to magnitudes using the in - band flux densities of vega : 278jy ( 3.6 @xmath0 m ) and 180jy ( 4.5 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the fluxes reported for both irac and wise are not color corrected for the difference between the spectral energy distribution of neptune and the fiducial spectral shape @xmath13 used in the calibration of irac @xcite , or the @xmath14 adopted for the calibration of wise @xcite .",
    "not attempting a color correction should not affect the measured color variation unless the underlying spectral energy distribution is also varying significantly .",
    "for a detailed color comparison between the irac and wise data , a sed must be assumed and color corrections applied to account for the different bandpass profiles and the different calibration assumptions .      _ wise _ was launched on 2009 december 14 to survey the sky in four broad wavelength bands referred to as w1 ( 3.4 @xmath0 m ) , w2 ( 4.6 @xmath0 m ) , w3 ( 12 @xmath0 m ) , and w4 ( 22 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "after an in - orbit checkout , _ wise _ began surveying the sky on 2010 january 14 in a sun - synchronous polar orbit around the earth , allowing the entire sky to be mapped in just six months . along the ecliptic , each location is visited a minimum of eight times during each sky pass , and each of those visits has an exposure time of 7.7s at w1 and w2 and 8.8s at w3 and w4 .",
    "those data are generally confined to a @xmath124-hour period since the observatory sweeps through roughly one degree in ecliptic longitude per day .",
    "exceptions to this are when the scan track is temporarily toggled to either larger or smaller longitudes in order to avoid the boresight s passing within five degrees of the moon . in such cases , observations of a particular sky location",
    "may be interrupted by a couple of days while the moon passes , in which case the coverage at that epoch may be spread over a few days surrounding the gap .    _",
    "wise _ completed its first full pass of the sky on 2010 july 17 .",
    "on 2010 august 05 , during the second pass , the outer , secondary tank was depleted of its cryogen , rendering the w4 band unusable .",
    "this was followed by depletion of cryogen from the inner , primary tank on 2010 september 30 , which rendered the w3 band unusable .",
    "the two short - wavelength bands were largely unaffected , so wise continued to collect data in w1 and w2 until the spacecraft was placed into hibernation on 2011 january 31 , having then completed two full sky passes and 20% of a third . _",
    "wise _ observations resumed in 2013 december as the re - branded _",
    "neowise _ mission , which is scheduled to map the sky six additional times .",
    "_ neowise _ observations will continue through the end of 2016 .",
    "the w1 band has a central wavelength designed to fall in the middle of the strong 3.3 @xmath0 m fundamental methane absorption band seen in colder brown dwarfs and giant planets .",
    "the w2 band has a central wavelength of 4.6 @xmath0 m , where the atmospheres of these objects are relatively transparent to radiation , assuming a cloud - free atmosphere .",
    "an example is the 5-@xmath0 m region in the atmosphere of jupiter , where thermal emission can be seen through holes in the thick cloud layer ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two bandpasses therefore can sample two very different physical regimes in the atmospheres of these objects and can be used to study their chemistry and physics ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) .    as can be gleaned from the _ wise _ bandpass coverages shown in figure 7 of @xcite and the _ spitzer_/infrared spectrograph ( irs ) spectra of known brown dwarfs in figure 5 of @xcite , the w3 band samples a wavelength regime including ch@xmath15 and nh@xmath16 absorption troughs . the w4 band , however , samples a region of the rayleigh - jeans tail with no sharp , deep molecular absorption bands , at least as predicted by brown dwarf atmospheric models ( @xcite ) .",
    "neptune has been observed at six different epochs in the currently available _ wise _ and _ neowise _ data releases .",
    "its magnitudes range from w1@xmath1710.1 - 11.5 mag , w2@xmath179.5 - 11.1 mag , w3@xmath172.8 - 3.1 mag , and w4@xmath170.0 - 0.3 mag . as stated in",
    "the _ wise _ all - sky release explanatory supplement ( @xcite ) , the detectors saturate at w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 magnitudes of 8.1 , 6.7 , 3.8 , and @xmath180.4 mag , respectively .",
    "the profile - fit photometric measurements can extend the usable range to brighter magnitudes by using the non - saturated wings of the stellar profile , and this extends _ wise _ photometric measurements to w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 levels of 2.0 , 1.5 , @xmath183.0 , and @xmath184.0 mag , respectively . because the measured magnitudes for neptune are fainter than these limits  and because the apparent size of neptune ( @xmath122 ) is far less than the _ wise _ resolution ( 61 , 64 , 65 , and 120 in w1 through w4 , respectively )  the profile - fit photometry listed for neptune in the _ wise _ single exposure source data bases should be of good quality .",
    "hst is capable of providing images of with spatial resolution of neptune s atmosphere @xmath11000 - 2000 km , thus providing dozens of resolution elements over neptune s 50,000 km diameter .",
    "although hst imaging was not obtained at the same time as the _ spitzer _ data , global neptune maps were obtained in 2015 september as part of the hubble outer planet atmospheres legacy ( opal ) program ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 5 ) .",
    "these maps were obtained in multiple filters , allowing direct viewing of the current cloud features , but with coarse temporal spacing .",
    "all filters redward of 600 nm show similar cloud features , with good contrast against the background atmosphere .",
    "the filter used most often , f845 m , provides the best light curve for comparison with other data sets .",
    "a discrete storm system was visible throughout 2015 near @xmath19 s and dominated the hubble ( 16@xmath20 peak - to - trough variation at 845 nm ) and 49-day kepler lightcurves ( 2@xmath20 peak - to - trough variation ) @xcite .",
    "this bright cloud feature at 45 s was suspected to be a bright companion cloud to an unseen dark vortex , similar to the great dark spot seen by voyager 2 @xcite .",
    "the 2015 hst observations indeed detected a dark feature at blue wavelengths , which was confirmed by more recent hubble imaging acquired on 2016 may 15 and 16 @xcite .",
    "the bright companion clouds were again present in the 2016 observations , strongly suggesting that they were still present during the _ spitzer _ observations , though at that time , neptune was too close to the sun for ground - based verification .",
    "another large bright storm system was also present in the 2016 data between 15 and @xmath19 s and was the brightest feature on the planet .",
    "this data set was not optimized for temporal sampling , with only 4 views over the course of 27.5 hours .",
    "at 763 nm , neptune again showed variations of about 0.2 mag due to the larger cloud system .",
    "we display light curves of neptune measured with _",
    "spitzer_/irac in figure [ fig : spitzerlc ] .",
    "the light curve data are provided in tabular form in table  [ tab : spitzer_3.6 ] and table  [ tab : spitzer_4.5 ] .",
    "these are the first continuous neptune light curves covering a full rotation at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "the amplitude at 3.6 @xmath0 m is 1.06mag , corresponding to a peak - to - trough flux variation of more than a factor of 2.5 ; at 4.5 @xmath0 m the amplitude is 0.59mag , corresponding to a peak - to - trough flux variation of about 1.7 .",
    "these are consistent with the amplitudes measured in the similar passbands _ wise _ w1 and w2 , respectively ( see below ) , but are much larger than the amplitudes of the k2 0.65   lightcurve of 2015 january ( @xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the hst 845 nm measurements ( 16% ) .",
    "we label the upper axes of figure  [ fig : spitzerlc ] in terms of rotational `` phase , '' derived using a rotation rate of 18.0hr , corresponding to zonal winds at @xmath21 latitude @xcite .",
    "assuming these observations bear the imprint of the brightest feature seen in the 2016 may hst images , an 18hr period is the approximate mean of the two largest power spectral density ( psd ) peaks found in k2 data corresponding to zonal winds between @xmath22 and @xmath23 latitude ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : spitzerlc ] , the 4.5@xmath0 m light curve obtains its minimum about 54 hours after the 3.6@xmath0 m curve , which is near phase zero under this definition . in other words , the 3.6 @xmath0 m and 4.5 @xmath0 m light curves exhibit minimum reflectance with a timing that is consistent with the rotational period of zonal winds at @xmath24 latitude .",

    "figure  [ fig : transmission ] shows that , in a cloud - free atmosphere , each filter should be sensitive to different altitudes , with the irac-1 band most sensitive to stratospheric levels , similar to the _ wise _ w1 ( 3.4 @xmath0 m ) filter",

    "integrated mid - ir lightcurves , we see little difference between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 channels , despite the large differences in methane opacity between the two bands .",
    "this implies that any cloud opacity must lie sufficiently high in the atmosphere that both bands see a comparable contribution .",
    "judging from figure 4 , this suggests that optically thick clouds , or at least the cloudtops , must lie above about 0.30 bar .",
    "further detailed modeling is required to refine this estimate .",

    "differences in cloud evolution or wind speed as a function of altitude would manifest as different periods in the light curves . a variation in the wind speed with altitude",

    "recent keck observations have detected vertical windshear on neptune by tracking resolved cloud features at two different infrared wavelengths @xcite , although the majority of discrete tracked features are too small and short - lived to create periodic photometric signals in the short duration lightcurve reported here . in general , the unresolved observations are sensitive to very large cloud systems with significant vertical range and uniform motion , producing similar lightcurves at all wavelengths studied .",
    "mapping the _ hubble _ data at 763 nm from 2015 and 2016 , figure  [ fig : hubble_maps ] shows that patchy cloud features are visible at most longitudes .",
    "these features evolve rapidly from day to day . in the 2015 data ,",
    "the dominant feature was the cloud system near @xmath19 s , while in 2016 , it is the larger storm complex between 15 and @xmath19 s. although there is incomplete coverage , there are still clouds at most longitudes , such that a 763 or 845-nm light curve is still sensitive to features outside the largest storm system . however ,",

    "the synergy between solar system and various brown dwarf and extrasolar planet cloud decks has been apparent for some time .",
    "@xcite suggested for example that the l to t type transition in brown dwarfs might be associated with the appearance of regions of low cloud opacity , analogous to jupiter s 5 @xmath0 m hot spots .",
    "many early searches for brown dwarf variability were likewise motivated by such comparisons .",
    "however a major difficulty is that , while there is a wealth of spatially resolved snapshots of giant planet atmospheres , there was a dearth of high cadence , full disk multi - band photometry of any planet in the outer solar system .",
    "this led @xcite , for example , to synthesize an artificial light curve of jupiter from static optical and thermal infrared images .",
    "the last few years has finally seen a new interest in such observations and a number of  solar system planets as point sources \" observations have been obtained by various observatories .",
    "here we presented full disk observations of an unresolved neptune by the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope and _ wise_. large amplitude ( @xmath1 1 mag ) variability is detected , likely arising from high contrast , optically thick cloud decks that overlie much of the atmospheric methane opacity .",
    "rotational variability due to bright clouds as seen in figure  [ fig : hubble_maps ] are consistent with our @xmath13 to @xmath15 @xmath0 m photometric signal . a similar result came from comparing the time series obtained by the _ k2 _ mission with _ hst _ images .",
    "large scale cloud features evolve in height , size , and overall contrast , and they appear and disappear at different latitudes . the single _",
    "spitzer _ visit to the planet reported on here was insufficient to detect such evolution .",
