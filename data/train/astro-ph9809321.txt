    "the central problem of accretion disk theory is how angular momentum is transported outward so that matter can accrete onto the central gravitating object .",
    "ever since shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) and pringle ( 1981 ) outlined the basic structure of accretion disk ( see also @xcite ) , the origin of enhanced ( or @xmath8 ) viscosity has been the subject of hundreds of research papers . classically , high reynolds number turbulence has been invoked to explain the enhanced viscosity .",
    "the driving mechanism(s ) of the turbulence in high - temperature ( for example , active galactic nuclei ) disk systems has been a long standing problem because of the _ apparent _ absence of linear instabilities in non - magnetized keplerian disks ( see review by @xcite ) . for this reason , magnetic fields and associated instabilities have been suggested as the origin of the enhanced viscosity in disks ( @xcite ) . the widely cited magneto - rotational instability",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) occurs only when the @xmath9 field is weak .",
    "also , it has been studied only for small patches of a disk using unphysical boundary conditions on the magnetic field .",
    "the nature of the global angular momentum transport remains an open problem .",
    "this paper reconsiders the question of the stability of non - magnetized keplerian disks .",
    "in particular , we find a linear instability of non - axisymmetric perturbations for conditions where the disk quantities , such as surface density and entropy have steep radial gradients .",
    "the conditions we consider are in general nonbarotropic which distinguish our work from that of papaloizou and pringle ( 1984 , 1985 ; goldreich , goodman , & narayan 1986 ; narayan , goldreich , & goodman 1987 ) . also ,",
    "in contrast with the work of papaloizou and pringle , the modes we consider are trapped at least initially in a narrow range of radii and therefore do not depend on reflections from inner and outer radii of the disk ( or tori ) .",
    "the instability we find will give rise to rossby vortices in the nonlinear limit .",
    "these vortices are well - known in thin , two dimensional planetary atmospheres , for example , jupiter s `` red spot . ''",
    "the persistence of such vortices would be crucial for the hydrodynamic transport of angular momentum in accretion disks . here , we present our findings of initial conditions which cause rossby waves to grow , and defer the nonlinear behavior of the vortices to future publications .",
    "we emphasize that the astrophysical relevance of this instability is the assumption that in the circumstances where accretion disks are important , mass at low temperature and entropy accumulates at some external radius to a thickness such that a condition of a local maximum in entropy is created because of confinement of heat",
    ". then a wave of non - linear rossby vortex excitation carries the mass , and entropy maximum inwards , exciting further vortices that transport the angular momentum outwards .    in  2",
    ", we consider the general stability of a 2d nonbarotropic disk and point out the role of a key function @xmath10 in determining the stability .",
    "we then study a case with a significant ` bump ' in the radial distribution of entropy ( or temperature ) and calculate its growth rate and dispersion relation . in  3 , we discuss the possible nonlinear evolution of rossby waves , especially their role in angular momentum transport .",
    "we consider the stability of a thin ( 2d ) , non - magnetized keplerian accretion disk . in treating the disk as 2d",
    "we assume that the vertical thickness @xmath11 is @xmath12 , perturbation wavelengths are much longer than @xmath11 . using an inertial cylindrical @xmath13 coordinate system , we have a surface mass density @xmath14 , and a vertically integrated pressure @xmath15 , we consider the equilibrium disk to be steady ( @xmath16 ) and axisymmetric ( @xmath17 ) , with the flow velocity @xmath18 ( that is , the accretion velocity @xmath19 is neglected ) , the gravitational potential @xmath20 ( the self - gravity is neglected in this study ) , and the radial force equilibrium , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mass of the central object .",
    "the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium gives @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the sound speed and @xmath5 is the adiabatic index .",
    "the perturbations considered are in the plane of the disk so that the perturbed surface mass density is @xmath25 ; the perturbed vertically integrated pressure is @xmath26 ; and the perturbed flow velocity is @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the equations for the perturbed disk are @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 = 0~ , \\eqno(1c)\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and we refer to @xmath33 as the entropy of the disk matter . equation ( 1c ) corresponds to the isentropic behavior of the disk matter .",
    "we use equation ( 1c ) for simplicity rather than the rigorous relation @xmath34 ( see papaloizou and lin 1995 ) .",
    "we consider perturbations @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the azimuthal mode number and @xmath37 the angular frequency . from equation ( 1a )",
    ", we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 . from equation ( 1b )",
    "we have @xmath41 @xmath42 here , @xmath43^{1\\over 2}$ ] @xmath44 is the radial epicyclic frequency and @xmath45 is the azimuthal wavenumber . from equation ( 1c )",
    ", we have @xmath46 which is the perturbed equation of state and @xmath47~ \\eqno(5)\\ ] ] is the length scale of the entropy variation in the disk .",
    "the nonbarotropic nature of the disk renders @xmath48 to be finite whereas for a barotropic disk ( i.e. , @xmath4 is a function of @xmath3 only ) , @xmath49 .    to further simplify the momentum equation ,",
    "we can write the right - hand - side of equation ( 3a ) as @xmath50 , where the prime denotes @xmath51 . next , equation ( 4 ) can be used to express this as @xmath52 , where @xmath53~ \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] is the length - scale of the pressure variation . for definiteness",
    "we assume @xmath54 .    using @xmath55 as our key variable ,",
    "we can now rewrite equations ( 3 ) as @xmath56 @xmath57 solving equations ( 7 ) for @xmath58 gives @xmath59~ , \\eqno(8a)\\ ] ] @xmath60 @xmath61~ , \\eqno(8b)\\ ] ] where @xmath62    for ` corotation modes ' where @xmath63 is small compared with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 . here , @xmath67 is the vorticity .",
    "the ratio @xmath68 is commonly referred to as the potential vorticity ( see for example drazin 1978 ) .",

    "a useful quadratic form can be obtained by multiplying equation ( 10 ) by @xmath73 and integrating over the disk .",
    "assuming @xmath74 for @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath76 @xmath77 |\\psi|^2~+\\ ] ] @xmath78 @xmath79 note that only the last two integral terms on the right - hand side of this equation involve the complex variable @xmath80 .    equation ( 10 ) can be solved by several methods ( e.g. , by a relaxation method or by shooting ) , but we defer the full discussion of its solutions to a future publication . in order to bring out the essential aspects of equation ( 10 )",
    ", we make simplifying assumptions which allow an analytic solution .",
    "first , when @xmath81 is a finite fraction of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we find that the integral involving @xmath84 is small compared to the integral with @xmath85 , so that the last term in equation ( 11 ) is negligible .",
    "furthermore , for the ` corotation modes ' where @xmath86 , and for conditions where the pressure variation with @xmath87 is such that @xmath88 is positive , the function @xmath89 is positive and real .",
    "it is physically possible to have @xmath64 positive and yet have a finite @xmath72 because the pressure and entropy variations need not to be the same .",
    "in fact , this is precisely a feature of nonbarotropic flow ( see next section ) .",
    "thus , the terms containing @xmath85 in ( 11 ) can be combined to give @xmath90^\\prime    \\eqno(12)\\ ] ]    putting equation ( 12 ) back into ( 11 ) and taking the imaginary part of ( 11 ) , we find that a solution is possible only for conditions where the imaginary part of ( 12 ) vanishes ( see also lovelace & hohlfeld 1978 ; hereafter lh ) . thus , we find that an instability is possible only if @xmath91^\\prime$ ] vanishes at some @xmath87 , in other words , the key function @xmath92 has a maximum or minimum .",
    "this newly defined function @xmath10 warrants further discussion .",
    "we believe that this expression is new and more general than those given in previous studies . with the above assumptions , we can write @xmath10 as @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are of course constrained by the radial force balance in the equilibrium .    an extremum of @xmath10 necessary for",
    "instability could come from several sources : ( a ) in the limit of incompressible and isothermal flow ( cf .",
    "@xcite for an application to flow in a tornado ) ; an extremum in the radial profile of @xmath96 is required to have unstable vortices .",
    "( b ) in the studies of lh and sellwood & kahn ( 1991 ) , a cold disk was assumed and @xmath6 was effectively taken as a constant . in this case",
    "@xmath10 is simply @xmath97 , which must have a maximum or a minimum for instability .",
    "similarly , in the cases considered by papaloizou & pringle ( 1984 , 1985 ) , where a polytropic ( barotropic ) @xmath98 equation of state is assumed , @xmath6 is again a constant throughout the disk so that a maximum or minimum of @xmath99 is needed for instability .",
    "( c ) in the present study , we treat the more general case where @xmath6 varies across the disk .",
    "an extremum in @xmath10 can result from having an extremum in @xmath6 directly ( that is , a local `` bump '' in the temperature profile of the disk ) , or by having a large enough gradient in @xmath6 which causes an extremum in the epicyclic frequency @xmath64 owing to the radial force balance .",
    "furthermore , we find below that instability occurs when a threshold in the variation of @xmath10 is exceeded . in view of equation",
    "( 13 ) , a variation of @xmath100 is more important in giving a change in @xmath10 than a comparable fractional variation of @xmath101 .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the vorticity equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) by taking the curl of equation ( 1b ) and combining with ( 1a ) , @xmath102 where again , @xmath103 is the vorticity .",
    "the right - hand side of this equation represents the thermodynamic driving of the vorticity . for a barotropic flow , @xmath98 , @xmath104",
    "this is the case for most previous studies ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . equation ( 15 ) says that each fluid element conserves its specific vorticity .",
    "in contrast , the term @xmath105 destroys this conservation and allows pressure forces to `` produce '' vorticity in the flow . in the non - barotropic case surfaces ( or lines ) of constant surface density and surfaces of constant specific entropy",
    "do not coincide .      for the ` corotation modes ' ( @xmath106 ) and",
    "@xmath107 , an approximate dispersion relation follows from equation ( 10 ) by taking the @xmath108dependence @xmath109 with @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "the dominant terms in ( 10 ) are : @xmath113 or @xmath114 ^ 2 -{1+{\\bf k}^2 h^2 \\over l_sl_p}}}~\\right]~ , \\eqno(17)\\ ] ] where @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the dispersion relation ( 17 ) is the disk analogue of the rossby wave dispersion relation ( see for example brekhovskikh & goncharov 1993 ) . note in particular that the group velocity of the waves in the corotating reference frame is in the direction opposite to that of the disk rotation .",
    "instability is possible if @xmath117 ^2 < ( 1+{\\bf k}^2 h^2)/(l_s l_p)$ ] , which requires @xmath118 .    from equation ( 17 ) , the maximum growth rate occurs for @xmath119 , and it is @xmath120 @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the keplerian velocity and @xmath123 is the growth rate .",
    "the maximum growth rate is @xmath124 , for a thin disk where @xmath125 and for @xmath126 .",
    "note in particular the geometrical optics relation for a wavepacket , @xmath127 so that @xmath128const . , and @xmath129 const .",
    "thus , a wave packet initially with @xmath130 is rapidly sheared by the differential rotation . in a time of order @xmath131",
    "the wave evolves into having a very short radial wavelength , @xmath132 , trailing spiral wave .",
    "this is discussed in detail by goldreich and lynden - bell ( 1965 ) .",
    "the maximum amplification a wave can have is @xmath133 \\approx { \\rm exp } [ ( 2/3)(c_s / v_k)(r^2/l_sl_p)^{1\\over2}]$ ] .",
    "the amplification is @xmath134 and is probably not significant for @xmath126 .      here , we consider conditions where @xmath135 has a maximum or minimum as a function of @xmath87 at @xmath136 of width @xmath137 .",
    "the case where @xmath138 has an extremum was treated earlier by lh .",
    "therefore , we consider the case where @xmath139 const and where @xmath6 has an extremum .",
    "the extremum of @xmath6 is thus an extremum of @xmath100 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , a variation of @xmath100 is more important in giving a change in @xmath10 than the variation of @xmath101 . for a maximum in @xmath6",
    ", we find using equations ( 17 ) and ( 19 ) that the radial group velocity of the waves @xmath140 is directed towards @xmath136 , whereas for a minimum the waves propagate away from @xmath136 .",
    "thus , a maximum of @xmath6 can give trapping of the waves in the vicinity of @xmath136 .",
    "this trapping obviates the need for reflecting disk boundaries considered by goldreich et al .",
    "( 1986 ) .    for definiteness",
    "we take @xmath141~ , \\eqno(20)\\ ] ] where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are constants . for simplicity",
    "we consider @xmath144 . in this limit",
    ", the real and imaginary parts of equation ( 10 ) for @xmath145 can be written as @xmath146 @xmath147 here , we have omitted the detailed expressions for @xmath148 and @xmath149 , both of which are real functions of @xmath48 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath36 ( see figures ) . it can be shown that @xmath148 and @xmath149 possess the following properties ( assuming @xmath152 = 1 $ ] ) : @xmath149 is an odd function of @xmath153 and is @xmath154 when @xmath155 ; but @xmath148 is an even function of @xmath153 .",
    "@xmath148 is @xmath156 for @xmath157 , which corresponds to a classically allowed region of motion in a potential well , and is @xmath158 for @xmath155 , which corresponds to a forbidden region .",
    "it is this potential well give rise to `` bound states '' which determines the growth rates @xmath159 .",
    "the existence of wave growth ( @xmath160 ) and its dependence on @xmath161 can be obtained by first considering the potential well for @xmath162 .",
    "the first appearance of a bound state in the well is given by the bohr - somerfeld quantization condition , @xmath163 this condition corresponds to a critical value of @xmath161 so that there can be a bound state with @xmath164 ( which is the middle curve in figure 1 ) .",
    "this is physically the threshold required for the growth of rossby waves .",
    "again , we emphasize that the existence of wave growth depends critically on the nonbarotropic nature of disk , because the main contribution to this potential well comes from @xmath165 , which is always nonpositive since @xmath166 whereas @xmath167 .",
    "this term vanishes when @xmath49 .",
    "figure 2 shows sample results for @xmath168 and @xmath169 by solving equations ( 21 ) using a shooting method .",
    "we omit discussing the detailed numerical method , but only point out that one can make use of the symmetry of the potential well as well as the boundary conditions at @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "the key physical variables are @xmath161 and @xmath172 .",
    "we find @xmath159 to have the approximate dependence @xmath173^{2 / 3}$ ] for @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the mentioned critical value and @xmath176 is a constant .",
    "figure 3 shows the vortical nature of the velocity field for the same unstable case as figure 2 .      to calculate the flux of angular momentum , we first note that , with the complex factors @xmath177 removed , @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 , where the @xmath181 superscripts denote even or odd _ real _ functions of @xmath153 . such properties are obtained by expressing them using equation ( 1 ) and @xmath182 . thus across a circle of radius @xmath136 , we have @xmath183 @xmath184 @xmath185 we find in general that @xmath186 .",
    "further , we find that each of the two factors in parentheses in ( 23 ) are positive .",
    "therefore , the trapped wave causes the _ outward _ flow of angular momentum across @xmath170 .",
    "furthermore , one notes that the positive transport is from a `` nonlinear '' term ( @xmath187 ) since the first order term vanishes .",
    "the astrophysical importance of this rossby wave instability is the implication that in the nonlinear limit , multiple rossby vortices will form after these waves break and coalesce in a few revolutions .",
    "hence , they provide a plausible explanation of the hydrodynamic transport of angular momentum in thin , keplerian accretion disks .",
    "the critical condition for the inception of this hydrodynamic transport , as derived in this linear case , is a minimum contrast ( @xmath188 ) in the radial distribution of entropy .",
    "thus , it is important that heat ( and thus entropy ) be preserved against cooling by radiation in at least tens of revolutions . roughly speaking , recognizing the large dynamic range and uncertainty of opacities",
    ", this implies a minimum mass ` thickness ' @xmath189 g @xmath190 . an important implication from this minimum mass ` thickness ' requirement is the prediction on the turn - on ( active state ) and",
    "turn - off ( quiescent state ) conditions for the angular momentum transport by the rossby vortices . specifically",
    ", we could envisage the following scenario : as mass accumulates in the disk by accretion , the resulting trapping of heat allows the temperature to rise by the energy input of accretion and an episode of rossby vortex accretion ensues . depending upon the heating , opacity conditions , and mass accretion rates",
    ", there will be a radius , a thickness , and therefore a mass where the rossby instability initiates .",
    "this mass and mass accretion rate determine the event luminosity and episode rate .",
    "finally we note that a given episode terminates when its mass is accreted presumably rapidly before additional mass is supplied .",
    "this understanding of the turn - on and turn - off conditions for rossby vortex transport may prove relevant for several astrophysical systems , such as the planet formation after the solar nebula has cooled ( cameron 1962 ) and outbursts from cvs and stellar mass black holes ( vishniac 1997 ) .",
    "although a localized high entropy region ( @xmath191 ) may appear to be a large deviation in @xmath6 , the resultant pressure gradient force is still very small compared to the gravitational force . in the case represented by all the figures , we have used an unperturbed @xmath192 , which gives @xmath193 at the peak of perturbed region ( @xmath191 ) . but this deviation in @xmath6 is sufficient to drive the growth of non - axisymmetric perturbations . a possible mechanism of formation of an entropy bump is from the interaction between the matter from roche lobe overflow and the accretion disk .",
    "a spiral shock can form in this situation ( sawada et al . 1986 ) .",
    "bracco et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have studied _ barotropic _ disks with initial perturbations in the potential vorticity ( @xmath194 ) profile .",
    "they showed that vortices can have a rather long life time .",
    "another possible nonlinear effect is the formation of spiral shocks which heat the disk and thereby maintain the bump against radiative cooling . in either case , requiring a finite entropy bump for the instability to grow implies a maximum cooling rate above which a bump which develops in the disk quickly decays away and such an enhanced viscosity model turns off . what remains to be determined",
    "is whether the bump `` holds together '' as it propagates radially inward . if these rossby vortices are indeed playing a major role in angular momentum transport , then they are fundamentally different from the usual @xmath8 viscosity prescription which is based on homogeneous turbulence . in contrast ,",
    "rossby vortices are large scale , coherent structures .",
    "preliminary numerical simulations using a high resolution ppm code ( nelson et al .",
    "1998 ) appear to confirm the existence of a threshold on @xmath161 for wave growth and the formation of anti - cyclonic vortices .",
    "numerical studies are now underway to follow the nonlinear evolution of the vortices in nonbarotropic disks and to study the associated transport properties ( nelson et al ."
