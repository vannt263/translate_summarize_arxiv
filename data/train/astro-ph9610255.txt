    "observations of stars of various metallicities [ @xmath2 @xmath3 ( fe / h)/(fe / h)@xmath4 have shown that the abundance ratios be / fe and b / fe do not vary appreciably over a broad range of @xmath2 ( e.g. duncan et al . 1996 ) . for @xmath2 less than about 0.1 , most of the fe is thought ( truran & timmes 1994 ) to be produced in type ii supernovae ( snii ) .",
    "limiting our considerations to this range of metallicities , the constancy of b / fe and be / fe strongly suggest that b and be are also produced by processes related to sniis .",
    "the accepted paradigm for the origin of most of the be is production in spallation reactions of accelerated particles .",
    "b , in addition to such reactions , is also produced in neutrino interactions in sniis ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "the observed be abundance as a function of metallicity can be approximated by @xmath5 ( duncan et al .",
    "1996 ) which , with the solar fe / h=3@xmath610@xmath7 , implies that @xmath8 , independent of @xmath2 .",
    "this constant ratio greatly simplifies the treatment of the evolution and thereby allows us to clearly exhibit the strong constraints that the be and b data place on cosmic ray acceleration in the early galaxy .",
    "we can simplify the equations of galactic evolution by considering the total be , b and fe contents of the galactic gas instead of the abundance ratios of these elements relative to h. assuming that the removal rates of these trace elements from the gas due to incorporation into stars , as well as the return rates due to stellar mass loss are small relative to their production rates ( assumptions whose consistency for @xmath90.1 we demonstrate below ) , the be and fe contents ( measured in number of atoms ) can be written as @xmath10 where the @xmath11 s are production rates ( measured in atoms / sec ) . an integral similar to that for",
    "be can also be written for b , but for now we limit our discussion to be because b could contain a significant non - cosmic ray contribution due to neutrinos . using the integral for fe , we can replace the time variable in the integral for be by the iron content fe .",
    "we obtain @xmath12 since be / fe is observed to be constant as a function of @xmath2 , it will also be constant as a function of fe as long as long as @xmath2 is a monotonic function of fe . in this case",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is @xmath13 = const .",
    "the calculated ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) @xmath14fe yields per snii , averaged over the scalo ( 1986 ) imf , lead to a relatively constant @xmath14fe yield as a function of @xmath2 ( ranging from 0.09 to 0.15 m@xmath15 per snii for @xmath2 varying from 10@xmath16 to 0.1 ) . taking the @xmath14fe yield per snii equal to 0.1 m@xmath15 ( consistent with sn87a observations )",
    ", we obtain @xmath17@xmath183.6@xmath610@xmath19 atoms / snii or 2.7@xmath610@xmath20 m@xmath15/snii , independent of @xmath2 .",
    "to see when the removal of be and fe can be ignored , let @xmath21 be the removal rate of galactic gas ( mostly h ) due to star formation .",
    "the rates @xmath22 of be and fe removal ( measured in g / sec ) are then 9(be / h)@xmath21 and 56(fe / h)@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "assuming that all stars of mass @xmath010m@xmath15 form type ii supernovae , the snii formation rate is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the scalo imf ( measured in number of stars per unit stellar mass ) . with",
    "be and fe productions per snii of @xmath25 and 0.1 m@xmath15 , respectively , the be and fe production rates @xmath26 ( measured in g / sec ) are @xmath181.35@xmath27 and @xmath185@xmath28 . since @xmath29@xmath185.2@xmath610@xmath30@xmath2 and @xmath31@xmath183@xmath610@xmath7@xmath2 , the production to removal ratio for both be and fe becomes @xmath32 thus , for @xmath2@xmath330.1 , @xmath34@xmath03 ( becoming @xmath18300 for @xmath2=10@xmath35 ) , allowing us to ignore the removal .",
    "this important result is simply the consequence of the fact that , while the be and fe productions are independent of the metallicity of the ism , their removal is proportional to the metallicity .",
    "we have shown ( ramaty et al . 1996 ) that the early galactic b / be data and the predicted b - to - be production ratio are consistent with a non - negligible contribution of @xmath36b production by neutrino spallation in sniis ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) . as both the b - to - be cosmic ray production ratio as well as the imf averaged @xmath36b production by neutrinos are nearly independent of metallicity , our results for be apply also for b.",
    "be and b production by cosmic rays depends on a variety of parameters , but the required constant production , @xmath37@xmath183.6@xmath610@xmath19 atoms / snii independent of metallicity , sets strong constraints on these parameters .",
    "we have developed a libeb production code ( ramaty et al .",
    "1996 ) in which a population of accelerated particles of given composition , energy spectrum and total power @xmath38 is injected into an ambient medium of given composition .",
    "we have taken into account all primary and secondary reaction paths leading to libeb from cno .",
    "we assume that the transport of the accelerated particles in the ism is characterized by a single parameter , @xmath39 , the particle escape path length from the galaxy which we take to be energy independent .",
    "the code employs updated nuclear cross sections and works equally well at nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic particle energies . for the ambient medium composition we use solar abundances scaled with metallicity . for the accelerated particles we use three compositions :    1 .",
    "ssz , identical to the ambient composition ; this would be the composition if the accelerated particles were accelerated directly out of the ism .",
    "snii , ejecta of type ii supernovae for various @xmath2 ( 12 - 40 m@xmath15 progenitors , woosley & weaver 1995 ) , averaged over the scalo imf ; these compositions would be appropriate if the accelerated particles were accelerated directly from the ejecta of such supernovae .",
    "the snii composition is very weakly dependent on metallicity ; p / o@xmath18100 , @xmath40/o@xmath1820 , c / o@xmath180.2 .",
    "3 .   snii@xmath41 , identical to snii but with p / o=@xmath40/o=0 .",
    "we employ a shock acceleration spectrum modified with a high energy turnover , @xmath42@xmath43(@xmath44/@xmath45)exp(@xmath46 ) , were @xmath11 is the injection rate of the accelerated particles , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are momentum and kinetic energy , both per nucleon , @xmath49 is velocity , and @xmath50 is a parameter .",
    "the deposited power that accompanies the nuclear reactions is @xmath38=@xmath51 .",
    "1 shows @xmath52 as a function of @xmath2 ( panel a ) and @xmath50 ( panel b ) .",
    "the be production per snii is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the mechanical energy of an snii available for acceleration and @xmath55 is the fraction of this energy going into the particles that produce the be .",
    "for the snii@xmath41 composition , which contains no accelerated protons and @xmath40 particles , the be is produced only by accelerated cno interacting with ambient h and he ; thus @xmath52 is not dependent on the ambient medium metallicity ( fig .",
    "this is also true for snii since the metallicity of this composition is high enough so that up to @xmath2=0.1 the contributions of accelerated protons and @xmath40 s is negligible .",
    "thus , if @xmath56 is independent of @xmath2 ( a reasonable assumption ) , then both snii ( for @xmath2@xmath330.1 ) and snii@xmath41 ( for all @xmath2 ) produce constant be yields per snii , as required by the data . on the other hand ,",
    "for ssz , for which the protons and @xmath40 s make a major contribution , the be yield is increasing with metallicity ( fig .",
    "1a ) , a result which is not compatible with the observed constant be / fe .",
    "this means that the accelerated particles responsible for the be production should be accelerated from freshly nucleosynthesized matter before it mixes with the ambient ism .",
    "that in the low metallicity era of our galaxy accelerated cno , and not protons and @xmath40 s , were responsible for the production of the be and b was pointed out by duncan , lambert & lemke ( 1992 ) and cass , lehoucq , & vangioni - flam ( 1995 ) . if @xmath57=10@xmath58 erg , we require that @xmath59@xmath01.2@xmath610@xmath60 to produce 3.6@xmath610@xmath19 be atoms per snii with an acceleration efficiency @xmath55@xmath330.3 . this constraint provides another argument against ssz for which @xmath59@xmath332@xmath610@xmath35 when @xmath2@xmath330.1 ( fig .",
    "for snii , @xmath52@xmath01.2@xmath610@xmath60 implies that @xmath50@xmath050 mev / nucl ( fig .",
    "1b ) , i.e. the accelerated particle spectrum must be relatively hard .",
    "the energetic constraint on @xmath50 is less severe for the snii@xmath41 composition .    from fig .",
    "1b the minimum energy ( @xmath55@xmath57@xmath1810@xmath1 erg ) required to produce the be is obtained for the snii@xmath41 composition .",
    "as this value is much lower than the energy per supernova imparted to the galactic cosmic rays ( a few times 10@xmath61 ergs ) , the be could be produced with less energy than needed to maintain the cosmic rays .",
    "the particles could be accelerated by the reverse supernova shock in all sniis , a scenario which could lead to the preferential acceleration of metals .",
    "thus as little as 3% of the total energy in accelerated particles could go into accelerating high metallicity snii ejecta to produce the bulk of the be and part of the b ( spallation by neutrinos producing the rest ) .",
    "the remaining 97% would go into accelerating cosmic rays out of the low metallicity ism .",
    "these cosmic rays produce very little be and b for z / z@xmath15 @xmath330.1 .",
