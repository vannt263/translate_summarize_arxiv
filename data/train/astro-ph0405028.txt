    "there appears a rapid progress on the mass estimate of the supermassive black hole ( sbh ) in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , which boosts our understanding of their central structure and their evolution ( bian 2004 ) .",
    "there is a subclass of agns called narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) ( boller et al .",
    "1996 ) , which is proposed to be in the early stage of agns evolution ( mathure 2000 ) .",
    "a popular model of nls1 is that they contain less massive black holes with super - eddington accretion , which leads to the steep x - ray slope founded in nls1s ( bian & zhao 2004a ) . to test this hypothesis we need to estimate the black hole mass of nls1s .",
    "there are many methods to calculate the black hole masses in agns ( bian & zhao 2004b and reference therein ) : ( 1)virial mass derived from the fwhm(h@xmath0 ) ( or other broad line ) and the sizes of broad line regions ( blrs ) from the reverberation mapping technique or the empirical size - luminosity formula .",
    "( 2)the relation between the mass and the bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( or [ o  iii ] linewidth ) ( m-@xmath1 relation ) or the bulge luminosity ( m-@xmath2 relation ) .",
    "( 3)soft x - ray variability .",
    "( 4)the mass from spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fit from the accretion disk model , such as the method using the soft x - ray hump luminosity for agns with super - eddington accretion rate .",
    "( wang & netzer 2003 ) .",
    "up to now , there are many nls1s samples ( bian & zhao 2004c ) .",
    "we used the sample of grupe et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for its completeness .",
    "we calculated the masses in agns using three different methods : virial mass from h@xmath0 line ( @xmath3 ) , the mass from [ o  iii ] line ( @xmath4)$ ] ) , and the mass from the soft x - ray hump luminosity ( @xmath5 ) . in fig .",
    "1 we plotted the mass from the x - ray luminosity versus from h@xmath0 line for the sample of grupe et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . from fig . 1",
    ", we found that sbh masses in nls1s can be reliably derived from soft x - ray luminosity for their super - eddington accretion .",
    "the consistency of @xmath3 and @xmath5 showed that these two methods are available to estimate the mass in nls1s , which is consistent that most of nls1s are in the super - eddington accretion state .",
