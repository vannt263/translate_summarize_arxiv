    "in cosmological models of structure formation , galaxies form from the condensation of baryons within larger dark matter ( dm ) halos .",

    ", the primordial dm density perturbations have slowly increasing amplitude down to sub - galactic scales , owing to the negligible thermal velocities of the cdm particles .",
    "this yields an ever - increasing number of collapsed small - mass halos , resulting into a steep halo mass function @xmath8 and into cuspy density profiles of dm halos . although the physics of baryons and the energy injected by supernovae ( dekel & silk 1986 ) are known to suppress the luminosity - to - mass ratio @xmath9 ( see somerville & dav 2014 and references therein ) and to expand the dm distribution inside halos ( see mashchenko , wadsley & couchman 2008 ; read & gilmore 2005 ; governato et al .",

    "see bode , ostriker & turok 2001 ) , composed by particles with masses in the kev scale ( see de vega & sanchez 2010 ) , are receiving increasing attention .",
    "in fact , in such a scenario the perturbation power spectrum is suppressed with respect to the cdm case at small scales @xmath14 mpc due to the free - streaming of the lighter and faster dm particles .",
    "the corresponding lack of small - scale power results in a reduced dwarf galaxy abundance and shallower inner density profiles naturally matching the observations ( macci et al .",

    "recent works have investigated the impact of adopting a wdm cosmology on galaxy formation , showing that it can naturally match the observed number of satellites ( nierenberg et al .",
    "2013 ) , the galaxy luminosity and stellar mass distributions over a wide range of masses and redshift ( menci et al . 2012 ; benson et al . 2013 ; dayal , mesinger , pacucci 2015 ) , as well as the star formation properties of low - mass galaxies ( calura , menci , gallazzi 2014 ) , thus constituting a viable framework for galaxy formation and even for the evolution of the agn population ( menci et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the two most popular classes of wdm particle candidates are thermal relic particles and sterile neutrinos ( for a discussion see colombi , dodelson , widrow 1996 ; for recent reviews see , e.g. , biermann , de vega & sanchez 2013 ) . while for the former it is possible to derive a one - to - one correspondence with the shape of the power spectrum , for sterile neutrinos the free - streaming length ( and hence the effect on the perturbation spectrum ) depends on their production mechanism ( see destri , de vega , sanchez 2013a ) . in fact ,",
    "these can be produced at the proper dark matter abundance through different processes : i ) scattering due to their mixing with active neutrinos through the dodelson & widrow ( 1994 ) mechanism ; ii ) resonant production including the case of lepton asymmetry ( shi & fuller 1999 ) ; iii ) coupling with other fields ( kusenko 2009 ; shaposhnikov & tkachev 2006 ) .",
    "several astrophysical constraints are leading to a rather definite window for the thermal relic mass @xmath15 , yielding a power spectrum corresponding to that produced by ( non - thermal ) sterile neutrinos with mass @xmath16 kev , depending on the production mechanism .",
    "indeed , these constitute the simplest candidates ( see , e.g. , abazajian 2014 ) for a dark matter interpretation of the origin of the recent unidentified x - ray line reported in stacked observations of x - ray clusters with the xmm - newton telescope with both ccd instruments on board the telescope , and of the perseus cluster with the chandra observatory ( bulbul et al .",
    "2014 ; independent indications of a consistent line in xmm - newton observations of m31 and the perseus cluster is reported in boyarsky et al .",

    "2014 and references therein ; lovell et al .",
    "lyman-@xmath27 is a challenging tool , and requires disentangling the effects of pressure support and thermal broadening from those caused by the dm spectrum , as well as assumptions on the thermal history of the intergalactic medium and of the ionizing background ( see garzilli & boyarsky 2015 ) .",
    "additional uncertainties may derive from rendering the velocity dispersion of the real wdm particles with simulation particles which are @xmath28 times heavier .",
    "also for the comparisons of sub - halos to milky way dwarfs , these usually assume a correction factor @xmath29 to account for the number of dwarfs being missed by current surveys , and lower correction factors would appreciably weaken the constraints .",
    "given the potential systematic problems with known astrophysical wdm constraints , and the present lack of experimental determination from particle physics experiments ( see , e.g. , lasserre et al .",
    "2014 ) , it is useful to explore different probes .    a first approach is to compare predicted mass distributions with observed luminosity functions of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "in fact , the exponential suppression of small - scale structures characteristic of wdm models should yield amplified differences with respect to cdm at early cosmic times , since in any hierarchical model of structure formation low - mass objects are the first to collapse . an observed abundance of galaxies at early epochs can in principle set strong lower limits on the wdm particle mass ( e.g. barkana , haiman & ostriker 2001 ; mesinger , perna & haiman 2005 ) .",
    "this is the approach taken by schultz et al .",
    "( 2014 ; see also dayal , mesinger , pacucci 2015 ) , who compare uv luminosity functions of dropout galaxies at @xmath30 with the predicted mass function of different wdm models , after connecting the uv luminosity to the dm halo mass through the abundance matching technique .",
    "the limit of this approach is constituted by the flux limits of present surveys .",
    "observational abundances at high redshifts @xmath31 can be derived only for relatively bright objects @xmath32 , corresponding to dm masses @xmath33 .",
    "thus , at present such an approach does not allow to probe different wdm models in the low - mass regime @xmath34 where the differences are maximal ; as a consequence , relatively loose limits @xmath35 kev can be set through such a method .    in this paper",
    "we take a different approach to set stringent limits on @xmath0 .",
    "we choose to compare with the uv luminosity functions at a lower redshift @xmath1 but extending to extremely faint magnitudes @xmath36 .",
    "although at such redshifts the differences among the predicted abundances are smaller than at @xmath37 , the gain in magnitude allows to probe the mass distribution down to extremely small dm masses @xmath38 , making possible to obtain tighter and robust limits on the wdm candidate mass . in particular , the deep uv imaging of lensing clusters with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) has recently allowed to exploit the large magnifications provided by the cluster potential wells to achieve unprecedented detection limit , detecting galaxies down to @xmath2 , i.e. , 100 times fainter than previous surveys ( alavi et al .",
    "although incompleteness correction and cluster mass model can still constitute delicate issues , this strategy of surveying large numbers of background galaxies with deep observations of lensing clusters has already been adopted with deep hubble imaging of the frontier fields beginning in cycle 21 .",
    "thus the approach we propose here will be soon applicable to compare with a much larger amount of data . as we shall show below",
    ", the above detection limits allow to probe the mass function of galaxies predicted by wdm with different particle masses @xmath0 in the region around and below @xmath39 where the different models predict maximally divergent abundances .",
    "in addition , as we shall show below , at such galaxy masses the wdm mass functions show a maximum which can be compared with the observed abundances to set limits to the particle mass @xmath0 which are in practice independent on the specific baryon physics adopted to connect uv magnitudes to dm masses .    to compare with observations , we derive the galaxy dm mass function from the monte carlo realizations of the history of dm halo and sub - halos ( see menci et al . 2012 and references therein ) .",
    "the processes included in the computation are recalled in sect .",
    "2 , where we also test our model results against recent n - body simulations . in sect .",
    "3 we connect the dm masses to uv luminosity , and parametrise the present uncertainties in the @xmath40 relation through a star formation efficiency @xmath41 .",
    "this allows us to compare ( sect .",
    "4 ) the observed densities derived from the deep uv luminosity function by alavi et al . ( 2014 ) with the dm mass function computed assuming different wdm thermal relic masses ranging from 1 kev to 2 kev , for a wide range of possible values of @xmath41 .",
    "we devote sect . 5 to conclusions .",
    "the backbone of the computation is constituted by the collapse history of dm halos on progressively larger scales .",
    "realizations of such histories are generated through a monte carlo procedure on the basis of the merging rates given by the extended press & schechter ( eps ) theory , see bond et al .",
    "( 1991 ) ; bower ( 1991 ) ; lacey & cole ( 1993 ) . in this framework ,",
    "the evolution of the dm condensations is determined by the power spectrum @xmath42 of dm perturbations ( in terms of the wave - number @xmath43 ) through the variance of the primordial dm density field .",
    "this is a function of the mass scale @xmath44 of the dm density perturbations ( and of the background density @xmath45 ) given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the window function ( see peebles 1993 ) . for the latter , here we adopt a sharp-@xmath48 form ( a tophat sphere in fourier space ) with a halo mass assigned to the filter scale by the relation @xmath49 with @xmath50 ( schneider et al .",
    "in fact , both theoretical arguments ( benson et al . 2013 ) and numerical experiments ( see schneider et al . 2012 ; 2013 ; angulo et al .",
    "2013 ) show that the resulting mass distributions and eps merger trees ( conditional mass function ) provide an excellent fit to n - body results for a wide range of dm masses and redshifts ( see schneider 2015 ) .",
    "thus , the linear power spectrum @xmath42 determines the history of collapse , the evolution , and the mass distribution of dm halos . for the cdm",
    "cosmology we adopt the form @xmath51 given by bardeen et al .",
    "the wdm spectrum @xmath52 is suppressed with respect to the cdm case below a characteristic scale depending on the mass of the wdm particles ( and , for non - thermal particles , also on their mode of production ; see kusenko 2009 ; destri , de vega , sanchez 2013a ) ; in fact , the large thermal velocities of the lighter wdm particles erase the perturbations with size comparable to and below the free- streaming scale @xmath53 . in particular ,",
    "if wdm is composed by relic thermalized particles , the suppression factor can be parametrized as ( bode , ostriker & turok 2001 ; see also viel et al .",

    "a similar expression holds for sterile neutrinos provided one substitutes the mass @xmath0 with a mass @xmath59 adopting proper conversion factors .",
    "note that different relations between @xmath59 and @xmath0 hold when different production mechanisms are considered ( see kusenko 2009 for a review , and lovell 2015 for a recent discussion ) .",
    "three typical sterile neutrino models are the dodelson widrow ( dw ) model , the shi fuller ( sf ) resonant production model ( depending on the lepton asymmetry @xmath60 ) and the neutrino minimal standard model ( @xmath61msm ) . the masses of the wdm particles in different production models giving the same power spectrum are related to the thermal relic mass @xmath0 according to the following formulas ( destri , de vega and sanchez 2013a ) : @xmath62 kev @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( in the case of @xmath65 ) , and @xmath66 .",
    "such conversions are based on the wdm primordial spectrum of fermions decoupling out of thermal equilibrium , computed by solving the evolution volterra integral equations derived from the linearized boltzmann - vlasov equations in de vega & sanchez ( 2012 ) .",
    "note however that the best - fit expressions for the numerically computed power spectra of non - thermal particles provided by different authors may differ in the literature : for a discussion concerning the accuracy of the above conversion factors and the comparison with previous literature ( including viel et al .",
    "2005 ) we refer to destri , de vega and sanchez ( 2013a ) .",
    "the characteristic scale of power suppression due to free streaming in wdm can be quantified through the ` half - mode ' scale at which the wdm transfer function drops to 1/2 ( schneider et al . 2012 ) .",
    "this is given by ( see schneider et al .",

    "@xmath68 kev considered here , one obtains @xmath69 . as shown by several authors ( schneider et al . 2012 , 2013 ; angulo et al .",
    "2013 ) , at this scale the dm mass function saturates and starts to turn off .",
    "thus , effectively constraining the wdm particle mass requires probing the abundance of dm halos down to masses @xmath70 .",
    "below such a mass scale , numerical simulations in wdm cosmology have long been subject to artificial fragmentation ( see , e.g. , wang & white 2007 ) . with the advances in the resolution",
    ", it has been shown that at scales below @xmath71 simulations yield a number of proto - halos , where the density peak has not fully virialised ( angulo et al .",
    "2013 ) ; at these scales , they outnumber the virialized halos . in this paper",
    "we are not interested in providing a detailed and improved description of the mass function , but rather to derive conservative upper limits to the abundance of low - mass galaxies to compare with observations in order to obtain constraints on the wdm particle mass .",
    "thus , we consider as an upper limit to the abundance of low - mass galaxies the total ( halo+proto - halo ) mass function , which is limited from above by the relation ( angulo et al .",
    "2013 ) : @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the mass function in the cdm case .",
    "thus , to derive conservative limits for the wdm particle mass , in the following we shall show the results of our computation for both the virialized halo and the halo+proto - halo population : the first is obtained from eps computed using the variance in eq .",
    "1 ( with a sharp - k filter for the window function ) and the spectrum in eq .",
    "2 ( depending on the chosen wdm mass @xmath0 ) ; the latter is obtained from cdm merging trees after artificially suppressing the abundance of dm haloes with masses @xmath74 with a probability @xmath75 ( depending on the chosen wdm mass through the corresponding half - mode mass @xmath71 in eq .",
    "since our aim is to compute solid upper limits for the wdm mass function ( and hence lower limits for the wdm particle mass ) , we do not explicitly include the effect of residual thermal velocities ( on top of gravitationally induced velocities ) derived by benson et al .",
    "in fact , their implementation is still matter of debate , and several authors argue that their effect is negligible for the models we consider ( macci et al .",
    "2012 ; shao et al .",
    "2013 ; schneider 2013 ; angulo et al .",
    "2013 ) . in any case , all authors agree that their inclusion would provide an even larger suppression of the wdm abundances below @xmath71 ( see , e.g. , benson et al .",
    "2013 ) , so that neglecting their effect allow us to derive conservative constraints .",
    "[ 0.38 ] [ 0.36 ]    after computing the histories of host dm halos with the eps approach described above , we follow the history of collapsed dm clumps once they are included in larger virialized host dm halos ( details on the computation are given in menci et al .",
    "2012 ; 2014 ) .",
    "such sub - halos , associated to the single galaxies , are tracked in our monte carlo simulations following the canonical procedure adopted by semi - analytic models of galaxy formation : they may survive as satellites , or merge to form larger galaxies due to binary aggregations , or coalesce into the central dominant galaxy due to dynamical friction ( see , e.g. , gan 2010 ; sommerville & dav 2014 and references therein ) .    to test our computation",
    "we first compare the resulting mass function of isolated halos ( host halos ) against existing n - body simulations at @xmath76 , close to the redshift range we shall focus on when we compare with observed luminosity functions . as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "1 , the agreement is excellent for isolated virialized halos using a sharp - k filter in the computation of the variance in eq .",
    "1 . testing our computation for the dynamical evolution of sub - halos associated to individual galaxies also leads to a very good agreement with the results from the bolshoi simulations ( klypin et al .",
    "2011 ) at the faint end of the distributions for different host halo masses ( right panels in fig .",
    "1 ) ; an analogous comparison with the sub - halo mass function resulting from the millenium simulations is presented in nieremberg et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , and also shows a good matching .",
    "thus , our computation provides reliable , tested results that can be used to predict galaxy mass functions for different wdm models , and to compare with the observed uv luminosity function at @xmath77 .",

    "we stress that our results are _ conservative _ and are robust with respect to present uncertainties in the modelling of the wdm mass distribution and - most important - with respect to the details in the baryonic physics .",
    "in particular , they are robust with respect to : i ) the specific value of the star formation efficiency @xmath41 and consequently the effect of baryonic processes ( like star formation , feedback ) determining the efficiency of star formation for given mass of the host dm halo .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ultra - deep observations we are comparing with allow us to probe the dm halo mass function in the mass range around the half - mode mass where the dm mass functions are characterized by a maximum value .",
    "ii ) the modeling of the effects of residual dm dispersion velocities on the mass function of dm haloes ( see sect .",
    "2.1 ) : while in our computation these have not been included , their effect would be to provide a sharper decrease of the mass function at small masses ( see , e.g. , benson et al .",
    "2013 ) , thus yielding tighter constraints .",
    "iii ) the kind of dm clumps hosting the uv emitting galaxies .",

    "iv ) the possible effects of uv background and reionization . indeed ,",
    "such effects go in the direction of further suppressing the abundance of galaxies in low - mass halos ( sawala et al .",
    "2015 ) , so our limits are conservative with respect to these processes .",
    "we also note the importance of having pushed the magnitude limit of the measured luminosity functions to faint values . indeed , limiting the computation to @xmath127 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) would only allow to obtain @xmath17 , as indeed already obtained by smith et al .",
    "( 2014 ) based on the uv luminosity functions at @xmath128 .    while our results are robust with respect to uncertainties in the modelling of baryon physics and of the halo mass distribution , they descend from the observed number densities derived by alavi et al . (",
    "2014 ) for the faintest galaxies in their sample .",
    "thus , a delicate issue is constituted by the analysis they adopted to measure the luminosity function at the faint end .",
    "uncertainties on the result of alavi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) can be due to the selection criterion of the @xmath77 galaxies , to completeness corrections , and to the estimates of the magnification factors .",
    "as for the first , the alavi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) galaxies have been selected through the widely used uv - dropout method ; further check with spectroscopic redshifts of a sample of ( intrinsically faint ) magnified sources demonstrated that this color criterion is able to recover 75% of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts @xmath129 , thus demonstrating the robustness of the adopted method .",
    "as for the correction for incompleteness at faint magnitudes , this has been derived through detailed simulations : alavi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) studied the completeness as a function of redshift , magnitude and magnification of the sources by a monte carlo approach , randomly varying also the igm transmission and the dust attenuations .",
    "in addition , they take into account the photometric uncertainties , the size distribution of the galaxies and the instrumental effects ( e.g. charge transfer inefficiency ) . at @xmath130",
    "the typical value for the completeness of galaxies of @xmath131 with a magnification of 5 magnitudes is @xmath132 . under these considerations",
    ", we can conclude that the incompleteness correction is robust even at their faintest limits .",
    "the uncertainties on the magnification can be the dominant source of errors in alavi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) results .",
    "indeed , one galaxy at @xmath131 in the sample has a magnification of 8 magnitudes ( a factor @xmath133 in luminosity ) . while , the reliability of this galaxy is not discussed in detail in alavi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the luminosity function at @xmath134 and @xmath2 we compare with is derived from 4 galaxies in total ( 2 for each mag bin ) with much lower magnifications , between 30 and 300 in luminosity .",
    "thus , the uncertainties in the observed number densities may be larger than those related to the poissonian noise : in fact , the schecher fit to the whole luminosity function in alavi et al . ( 2014 ) , when computed in the faintest magnitude bin @xmath22 , is centered significantly lower than the measured number density .    to discuss the impact of the uncertainties in the measurements by alavi et al . ( 2014 ) and to the aim of providing a baseline for future observations , we compare in fig .",
    "3 the measured density of galaxies with @xmath2 with that expected for different wdm particle masses ( expressed as above in terms of the equivalent thermal relic mass @xmath0 ) ; the color code shows the star formation efficiency parameter @xmath41 adopted to convert from the dm mass function to the luminosity function . to discuss the impact of uncertainties in the measurement by alavi et al . (",
    "2014 ) , we show both the poissonian errorbars ( hatched region ) and ( as a dashed line ) the number density corresponding to the schechter fit of the whole sample in alavi et al . ( 2014 ) computed at @xmath2 . relying on the number density corresponding to the binned data in alavi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) implies a limit @xmath4 kev for the mass of the thermal relic wdm particle , while assuming a larger uncertainty covering the whole range between the binned data and the schechter fit yields a weaker but still significant limit @xmath5 kev .",
    "[ 0.36 ]    next results from frontier field surveys will allow for a confirmation , or even for a strenghtning , of the limits on @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , although the lensing cluster abell 1689 is at the moment the most studied cluster with deep hst images and with the most constrained magnification map ( 43 confirmed multiple systems with 24 measured spectroscopic redshifts , see limousin et al .",
    "2007 ; coe et al . 2010 ) , this database will be probably superseded soon by the advent of the hst frontier field initiative . in this respect ,",
    "we stress that , although in this paper we focus on the comparison of different dm models with the measurements by alavi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the strategy of surveying large numbers of background galaxies with deep observations of lensing clusters has been adopted with deep hubble imaging of the frontier fields .",
    "thus , the results presented here will constitute a reference baseline for deriving limits on wdm particles from such surveys in the near future .",
    "for the moment , we note that matching a given observed density requires decreasing values of the @xmath41 parameter for increasing values @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we recover the well - known result that the cdm limit corresponding to large @xmath126 kev is associated to very inefficient star formation efficiencies @xmath135 ( unless a severe suppression of galaxy formation takes place in low mass dm halos with @xmath136 , see sawala et al . 2015 ) . note that although the results in the plot have been computed at @xmath77 they remain practically valid up to @xmath137 , since the low - mass end of the mass function remains almost unchanged in such a range of redshifts .",
    "we stress that the masses @xmath0 in fig .",
    "3 are the equivalent thermal relic masses .",
    "we note in particular that a sterile neutrino with a mass @xmath138 kev , constituting the best candidate for a dm interpretation of the origin of the recent unidentified x - ray line reported in stacked observations of x - ray clusters ( bulbul et al .",
    "2014 ; boyarsky et al .",
    "2014 ) , corresponds ( in the case of shi - fuller sterile neutrinos ) to a thermal relic mass @xmath139 kev , which is consistent with the observed abundance of galaxies at @xmath2 for a wide range of star formation efficiency @xmath140 . notice",
    "that - since for @xmath141 kev the wdm scenario is nearly indistinguishable from cold dark matter on the scales relevant for galaxy formation - our results define an effective window @xmath142 kev for the ( thermal relic ) mass of wdm particles .",
    "finally , the above limits are in agreement with the lower bound obtained from applying the thomas - fermi theory to compact dwarf galaxies ( destri , de vega , sanchez 2013b ) .",
    "we showed how the magnitude limits @xmath2 of present and forthcoming uv luminosity functions allow to probe the number density of dm halos close to - or even below - the half - mode mass of warm dark matter scenario , corresponding to scales @xmath143 .",
    "this provides strong constraints on the mass of the wdm particles which are in practice unaffected by the details of the baryon physics determining the @xmath9 ratio which at present is measured only for brighter galaxies .",
    "in fact , as long as the number density of ultra - faint galaxies is high enough , our approach yields constraints on the wdm particle mass that are independent on the star formation efficiency @xmath41 .",
    "we applied our method to the observations by alavi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , who use a foreground galaxy cluster as a lens to magnify background galaxies , so as to measure uv luminosity functions down to the above magnitude limits .",
    "the measured abundance of galaxies in the faintest magnitude bin @xmath22 yields a lower limit @xmath4 kev for the mass of wdm thermal relic particles , while a limit @xmath5 kev is obtained when we compare with the schechter fit to the observed luminosity function presented in alavi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "the corresponding lower limit for the sterile neutrino mass depends on the production model ; for instance , the limit @xmath4 kev for thermal relics corresponds to @xmath124 kev in the case of the shi fuller model with vanishing lepton asymmetry ( see the discussion in sect . 2.1 for the conversion factors when other models are considered ) .",
    "the above limit is conservative and robust with respect to the theoretical uncertainties still affecting the computation of the mass function of galactic dm clumps ( effects of residual thermal velocities , inclusion of proto - halos ) and with respect to the details of the baryon physics ( star formation efficiency @xmath41 in a given dm halo , see sect .",
    "tighter constraints will be achievable when observational determinations of @xmath41 at @xmath77 will be available for galaxies with @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , or when the number density of such faint galaxies at higher redshift @xmath144 will be measured or extrapolated : the latter approach has been proposed by lapi & danese ( 2015 ) , who suggest to constrain the abundance of such faint galaxies at high redshift by requiring them to satisfy the planck constraints on reionization .",
    "of course , the above limit @xmath145 kev relies on the statistics of ultra - faint field galaxies observed through the magnification provided by lensing clusters ( see discussion in sect 3 ) , which at present is limited to a1689 .",
    "however , the present statistical limitations will be superseded by the completion of the hst frontier field initiative .",
    "the frontier field campaign ( e.g. coe et al . 2015 ) is collecting observations of 6 strong lensing clusters with 7 hst optical and near infra - red bands to a 5@xmath18 depth of  28.5 ( ab magnitudes ) .",
    "most importantly , large efforts are ongoing to complement hst observations with ancillary imaging data from space - based uv ( siana et al .",
    "2014 , similarly to the abell-1689 data discussed in alavi et al .",
    "2014 ) ground - based infra - red , spitzer mid - infrared , and with deep follow - up spectroscopy ( e.g. wang et al .",
    "2015 , karman et al .",
    "lens models of the frontier field clusters are being produced and constantly updated by several different teams , and can be found at the hubble frontier field website .. according to richard et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , between 17% to 38% of the area in the image plane in each of the frontier fields cluster pointings benefits of a magnification @xmath146 .",
    "this implies that galaxies as faint as @xmath147 , -13.3 , -13.6 ( assuming @xmath148 ) , are detectable at @xmath1493 , 4 , 5 , respectively , over a total of  7 sq .",
    "the frontier field will thus soon allow to extend the investigation of the ultra - faint end of uv luminosity functions at @xmath150 to a @xmath151 6 times wider area with respect to alavi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , while also addressing any concern due to cosmic variance thanks to the observation of six independent pointings , which should reduce it by a factor @xmath152 .",
    "such an observational program will allow to decrease the statistical uncertainty on the measured density of ultra - faint uv galaxies by a factor 3 at least .",
    "the effects of such an improvement in the statistics can be appreciated from inspection of fig .",
    "3 . as an example , assuming the same central value for the observed number density , rising the lower limit ( solid thick line ) by a logarithmic factor 0.4 would provide a constraint @xmath23 kev on the mass of wdm particles .",

    "<S> we compute the mass function of galactic dark matter halos for different values of the warm dark matter ( wdm ) particle mass @xmath0 and compare it with the abundance of ultra - faint galaxies derived from the deepest uv luminosity function available so far at redshift @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude limit @xmath2 reached by such observations allows us to probe the wdm mass functions down to scales close to or smaller than the half - mass mode mass scale @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed for an efficient discrimination among predictions for different @xmath0 which turn out to be independent of the star formation efficiency adopted to associate the observed uv luminosities of galaxies to the corresponding dark matter masses . adopting a conservative approach to take into account the existing theoretical uncertainties in the galaxy halo mass function , we derive a robust limit @xmath4 kev for the mass of thermal relic wdm particles when comparing with the measured abundance of the faintest galaxies , while @xmath5 kev is obtained when we compare with the schechter fit to the observed luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding lower limit for sterile neutrinos depends on the modeling of the production mechanism ; for instance @xmath6 kev holds for the shi - fuller mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the impact of observational uncertainties on the above bound on @xmath0 . as a baseline for comparison with forthcoming observations from the hst frontier field </S>",
    "<S> , we provide predictions for the abundance of faint galaxies with @xmath2 for different values of @xmath0 and of the star formation efficiency , valid up to @xmath7 . </S>"
