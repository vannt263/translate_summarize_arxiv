    "electronic quantum effects in mesoscopic  @xcite and in disordered conductors  @xcite are controlled by the conduction electrons dephasing  @xcite rate , @xmath4 , which is expected to vanish with the temperature  @xcite",
    ". a very intriguing apparent saturation of this dephasing rate in several systems was recently reported  @xcite at very low temperatures .",
    "serious precautions  @xcite were taken to eliminate experimental artifacts .",
    "it was speculated that such a saturation of the dephasing rate when @xmath5 might follow from interactions with the zero - point motion of the environment .",
    "these speculations have received apparent support from calculations by golubev and zaikin  @xcite , which generated a major controversy  @xcite in the recent literature .",
    "interestingly , however , this issue had appeared already in 1988 , and good arguments against dephasing by the zero - point motion have already been given then  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these results were in disagreement with other experiments , for example , by khavin _",
    "et al . _",
    "more recent experiments  @xcite showed that in _ some _ cases the presence of trace magnetic impurities , even on the ppm level , caused the apparent saturation of the low - temperature dephasing .",
    "similar effects may exist for models  @xcite with low - lying two - level systems ( tls )  @xcite , where an apparent saturation of the low - temperature dephasing rate may occur ( which will , however , be eliminated at the @xmath5 limit ) .",
    "for the case of magnetic impurities , such an elimination of the dephasing rate will occur if and when kondo screening of the magnetic moments or their freezing into a spin - glass state takes place .",
    "in fact , it is physically clear that since dephasing must be associated with a change of the environment state  @xcite , it can not happen as @xmath5 , except when a large ground - state degeneracy occurs . in that limit neither the electron nor the environment has any energy to exchange .",
    "this is a very general statement ; the only physical input needed for it to hold true is that both the interfering particle and its environment are in equilibrium at the temperature @xmath6 ( which we then let approach zero ) .",
    "this is so because the linear transport under consideration is rigorously determined by equilibrium dynamic correlation functions .",
    "obviously , nothing prevents a high - energy particle far from equilibrium to thermalize with the ( @xmath5 ) bath by giving it energy , losing its phase coherence in the process .",
    "therefore , dephasing of a particle which is far from equilibrium with a @xmath7 bath is , of course , possible . as will be discussed later in this article , an example for such a situation",
    "occurs when the energy of the conduction electrons exceeds the thermal one , due to a voltage bias larger than @xmath8 and slow relaxation  @xcite .",
    "in the theoretical part of the present paper we do not attempt to settle the important question of where have the calculations leading to @xmath5 dephasing without magnetic impurities or tls gone wrong  @xcite .",
    "we shall start by converting the above physical argumentation for the lack of @xmath5 dephasing into a more rigorous one .",
    "we shall note that , like many other physical properties , the dephasing rate can be expressed in terms of correlation functions of the conduction electron and those of the environment with which it interacts  @xcite .",
    "using very general properties of these correlators  @xcite , which are almost always valid , we prove following refs .",
    "@xcite that the dephasing rate has to vanish at the @xmath5 limit , unless a large ground - state degeneracy exists .",
    "such a degeneracy may be brought about , e.g. , by free uncompensated magnetic impurities at a vanishing magnetic field . because these magnetic moments will typically be screened or frozen when @xmath5 , the proof encompasses most systems of relevance . since it employs mainly the basic laws of thermodynamics , the proof is valid for any case in which @xmath9 is determined from _ linear _ transport measurements .",
    "experiments were performed to examine the real - life validity of the above statement .",
    "our experiments  @xcite demonstrate unequivocally that indeed when strictly linear transport is used , the apparent low - temperature saturation of @xmath2 is eliminated .",
    "extremely small measurement currents had to be used in order to be in the linear - transport regime ( see also ref .",
    "these observations , along with the apparent lack of heating of the conduction electrons ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and below ) , pose new and interesting basic questions .",
    "another novel result of the experiments is that introducing heavy nonmagnetic impurities ( gold ) into our samples produces , even in linear transport , an anomalously large dephasing rate at very low temperatures , but _ not _ at the @xmath5 limit .",
    "we show that low - lying local defects , as suggested for example in  @xcite , may produce a relatively large dephasing rate at low temperatures , which in fact vanishes when @xmath5 .",
    "in this section , we shall derive a very useful expression for the dephasing rate of a `` particle '' coupled to the `` environment '' .",
    "the latter , which will also be referred to as `` the bath '' , represents all the degrees of freedom that the particle is coupled to and are not directly observed in the interference measurement . as we show below , the dephasing rate can be expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fourier transform of the interaction @xmath13 between the conduction electron and the particles of the bath , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the dynamic structure factors of the conduction electron and the bath , respectively .",
    "these structure factors , which are the fourier transforms of the density - density correlation functions  @xcite , contain the necessary physical information on both the particle and the bath  @xcite .",
    "a subtle relevant example is provided by the case where the particle and the bath are identical fermions .",
    "the pauli principle constraints are automatically taken into account by using the @xmath16 of the particle _ in the presence of the bath_. these structure factors are in principle known for models of interest .",
    "they can , for example , be obtained from the dissipative part of the linear response function @xmath17 , by using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the physical meaning of the expression in eq .",
    "[ magic ] is simply that the rate of creating ( or annihilating ) _ any _ excitation in the environment is the sum of these rates for all @xmath18 channels .",
    "the dynamic structure factor is well known for a diffusing electron . in the classical limit , @xmath19 , it is given by a lorentzian of width @xmath20 .",
    "the low - temperature case  @xcite will be discussed later on . replacing @xmath21 with the dynamic structure factor of the electron gas , given to leading order by @xmath22 ( see , e.g. , eqs .  3.28 and 3.44 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , allows for an extremely simple calculation of the dephasing rate by electron - electron interactions , which reproduces the results of ref .  @xcite .    for a derivation of the basic equation  [ magic ] ,",
    "we start with a direct - product state of the particle and the environment , @xmath23 , and evaluate the rate of transitions into _ all different _ possible states , @xmath24 , using the golden rule . in other words , at any later time @xmath25 , the state of the total system evolves into @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is a normalization factor .",
    "the transition probability from @xmath28 is simply @xmath29 . at times larger than microscopic ,",
    "the transition rate out of the initial state is well - known to be given by ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath30 here the last integral represents the ( joint ) density of final states , @xmath31 , having the same energy as the initial one , @xmath32 .",
    "the matrix elements in the last equation are easily evaluated from the fourier representation of the interaction @xmath13 : @xmath33 where the index @xmath34 runs over the particles in the bath .",
    "the absolute value squared of this matrix element consists of `` diagonal '' terms ( @xmath35 ) which are positive , and `` nondiagonal '' terms ( @xmath36 ) whose phases are random .",
    "an important step is now to average the result over , for example , the impurity ensemble .",
    "this will eliminate all the nondiagonal terms , leaving only the diagonal ones .",
    "we now introduce a thermal averaging over the initial state , @xmath32 , by summing over @xmath37 and @xmath38 , with the factorized weight of that initial state , @xmath39 , in obvious notation .",
    "it is immediately recognized that the integral in eq .",
    "[ rate ] contains the product of the dynamic structure factors of the particle and the environment . as a result",
    ", we obtain eq .",
    "[ magic ] for the rate @xmath40 .",
    "we emphasize that this result is exact within the golden - rule formulation , which fully captures the decay of a given initial state into a continuum .",
    "based on a single - particle picture , it equally applies to low - energy quasiparticle excitations in a fermi liquid .",
    "hence this result extends well beyond perturbation theory for the _ bare electrons _ in the system . it does not apply to systems that develop a non - fermi - liquid ground state .    using fashionable terminology",
    ", @xmath40 is the rate at which the particle gets `` entangled '' with the environment . in most situations ,",
    "@xmath40 is identical to the dephasing rate @xmath41 .",
    "important exceptions having to do with the infrared behavior of the integral in eq .",
    "[ magic ] , relevant at lower dimensions , were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .      as discussed above",
    ", an important advantage of the present formulation is that all the relevant physical information is contained within the correct dynamic structure factors of both the particle and the environment .",
    "for example , at @xmath7 , when the electron is diffusing on the fermi surface , it can not lower its energy .",
    "hence its dynamic structure factor automatically vanishes for positive frequencies  @xcite , as does the dynamic structure factor of the electron gas at @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "these facts are guaranteed by the detailed balance condition : @xmath43 more generally , because of the occurrence of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the two dynamic structure factors , the integrand in eq .",
    "[ magic ] vanishes in general at any @xmath44 at the @xmath3 limit , see fig .  1 .",
    "in mathematical terms , it has `` no support '' .",
    ".4 in   as functions of @xmath46 , for @xmath42 ( schematic sketch ) .",
    "note that the product vanishes everywhere.,title=\"fig : \" ]    therefore , except for the unusual case where the environment has a massive ground - state degeneracy , the dephasing rate must vanish at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "this fact follows directly from eq .",
    "[ rate ] also prior to carrying out the impurity - ensemble averaging .",
    "if both the particle and the environment start at their lowest states , it is impossible that both @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "all this is guaranteed by basic thermodynamics .",
    "the only exception is when a large ground - state degeneracy exists in the environment , a situation which is very rare indeed , because such a degeneracy will typically be lifted by some perturbation that exists in the system .",
    "as mentioned above , this formulation breaks down in the case of a non - fermi - liquid ground state , when the elementary excitations of the system are not of single - particle nature .",
    "a notable example is provided by the two - channel kondo effect , where single - particle  to  single - particle scattering is absent on the fermi level at @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , the corresponding @xmath49 matrix has no matrix element to any outgoing state containing arbitrary finite numbers of particle - hole pair excitations  @xcite .",
    "this means that any scattering at @xmath42 necessarily leaves its mark on the environment , resulting in a finite zero - temperature dephasing rate  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the two - channel kondo effect itself stems from a ground - state degeneracy that can not be lifted .",
    "hence a macroscopic ensemble of two - channel kondo impurities likewise requires a macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "thus , the `` standard model '' of linear transport in disordered metals ( in which the defects are strictly frozen ) gives , as expected , an infinite @xmath9 at @xmath7 . on the other hand",
    ", there may be other physical ingredients that can make @xmath2 relatively short at very low temperatures ( but still _ divergent _ at the @xmath5 limit ) , _ without _ contradicting any basic law of physics .",
    "what is needed is an abundance of low - energy modes in the environment .",
    "a simple model for such modes was suggested in ref .",
    "its physics is reminiscent of models for @xmath50 noise , but the relevant frequencies here are in the gigahertz range and above .",
    "that type of model is a particular one , and its requirements may or may not be satisfied in real samples .",
    "however , other models with similar dynamics might exist as well .",
    "we reiterate that such models do _ not _ imply dephasing by zero - point fluctuations .",
    "the explanation for the large low - temperature dephasing rate is certainly not universal . in some cases this extra low - temperature dephasing depends on sample preparation , and on extremely small concentrations of stray magnetic impurities  @xcite . in other cases  @xcite `` nonequilibrium '' behavior , i.e.",
    ", the sample _ not _ being in the linear - transport regime , is the relevant issue .",
    "recent experiments on the behavior of the phase coherent time in indium - oxide films showed some intriguing features .",
    "these results did not confirm the claim  @xcite that there is ` inherent saturation ' of @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , in all cases @xmath2 diverged when @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "several aspects of the data reproduce the findings of mohanty _",
    "et al_. most importantly , over a considerable range of measurement conditions ( in particular , the electric field @xmath51 applied in the magneto - resistance measurements ) , the dephasing rate was @xmath6-independent below @xmath52k , while the resistance was @xmath6-dependent .",
    "the latter suggests that _ heating _ is not a serious problem in this range of fields , a conclusion reached by mohanty _",
    "based on the same observation .",
    "we also agree with these authors that external noise is not likely to be the source of the apparent saturation . in the indium - oxide films",
    ", however , it appears that the saturation is due to _ non - equilibrium _ effects , namely , when the conductance is no longer given by the standard second - order current - current correlation function .",
    "indeed , it was shown that the problem of apparent saturation disappeared when sufficiently small bias conditions were employed .",
    "it was also shown that in order to be in the linear - response regime , the electric field used in the magneto - resistance ( mr ) measurements must be smaller than @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the energy relaxation length .",
    "the energy relaxation length @xmath54 is the spatial scale over which the electrons lose their excess energy ( gained from their motion in an electric field ) to the environment .",
    "this length should _ not _ be confused with @xmath55 , which is the phase - coherent diffusion length . except when dominated by electron - phonon scattering",
    ", @xmath54 varies much faster with @xmath6 than @xmath55 , and may attain macroscopic values at low temperatures  @xcite . in the pure in@xmath56o@xmath57 samples , for example , @xmath54 reached values of a few mm s below @xmath52k .",
    "another intriguing finding in our studies is the behavior of the dephasing rate versus temperature of the au - doped samples .",
    "figure  3 illustrates this behavior for one such sample that was extensively studied .",
    "these measurements were all performed in the linear - response regime , which was much easier to achieve than in the pure in@xmath56o@xmath57 samples due to the relatively short @xmath54 .",
    "note that the dephasing rate is well behaved for @xmath58k , and vanishes as @xmath5 ( based on data for @xmath59k ) .",
    "the intermediate temperature regime reveals , however , an anomaly ; @xmath60 seems to be almost independent of temperature .",
    "in fact , if the measurements were carried out only down to @xmath61k , one might have concluded that @xmath9 has saturated !",
    "this behavior was observed in all our au - doped samples ( with doping levels of 1 - 3% ) , and it illustrates a new type of an apparent saturation problem .",
    "the overall shape of @xmath62 is somewhat similar to the respective behavior observed in au films doped with fe @xcite , and in cu films doped with cr  @xcite .",
    "both are well - known kondo systems , and the  hump  observed in their @xmath62 data was indeed interpreted as extra dephasing due to the kondo effect .",
    "when we tried to repeat the analysis of these authors on our data , we encountered a number of difficulties . in the first place , to fit the excess dephasing rate with the formulae used by these authors required a spin of the order of 10 ( rather than @xmath63 in their case ) , which makes no physical sense .",
    "more importantly , we failed to detect any independent evidence for magnetic impurities ( above 1ppm ) , either in the sample or in the au material that was used for doping  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is strong evidence against dephasing by magnetic impurities in the mr data themselves . consider the mr data shown in fig .",
    "the values of @xmath64 are obtained by fitting mr data to weak - localization theory , which usually is based on data taken at small magnetic fields . in the graphs of fig .  2 , however , we deliberately extended the mr measurements to include much larger fields . note that in both graphs data are shown up to fields that are high enough to cause significant spin polarization ( the zeeman energy exceeds @xmath8 ) . yet , a nearly perfect fit to the theory ( dashed black lines ) is obtained using one value of @xmath2 for each temperature .",
    "if there were a contribution from a spin - flip mechanism ( as one may expect from the presence of magnetic impurities ) , it would be impossible to fit the low - field data ( namely , for @xmath65 ) with the same @xmath2 as the one necessary for @xmath66 .",
    "the difference that might be expected is illustrated in the top graph of fig .  2 by the dotted line .",
    "the latter represents the mr that ought to be observed when the extra contribution to dephasing by the alleged kondo impurities is suppressed by @xmath67 .",
    "it would therefore appear that the anomaly represented by the  hump  around @xmath61k in fig .",
    "3 is not due to the usual spin - flip scattering , resulting from the presence of magnetic moments .",
    ".5 in   o@xmath57:au sample ( thickness 200@xmath68 with 2@xmath69 au ) .",
    "dashed lines are fits to theory using a _ single _",
    "@xmath9 for each of the temperatures shown ( one above and one below the anomaly).,title=\"fig : \" ]    we shall now attempt to explain the restricted saturation below @xmath70k in these samples based on the observation that this anomaly originates form the inclusion of gold atoms in the in@xmath56o@xmath57 matrix , and is absent in the pure material . as noted elsewhere  @xcite ,",
    "the au atoms probably reside in the oxygen vacancy ( or di - vacancy ) sites of the in@xmath56o@xmath57 ( which is typically 10% oxygen deficient , see ref .",
    "given the chemical inertness of gold , it is not implausible that a sizeable portion of the au atoms are loosely trapped in oxygen di - vacancies , thus acting as local scatterers with a low characteristic frequency . for simplicity , we model such a defect as a local tls having a typical energy @xmath71 ( associated with two nearly equivalent positions of the au in the di - vacancy ) .",

    "<S> the conduction electrons dephasing rate , @xmath0 , is expected to vanish with the temperature </S>",
    "<S> . a very intriguing apparent saturation of this dephasing rate in several systems was recently reported at very low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the suggestion that this represents dephasing by zero - point fluctuations has generated both theoretical and experimental controversies . </S>",
    "<S> we start by proving that the dephasing rate must vanish at the @xmath1 limit , unless a large ground state degeneracy exists . </S>",
    "<S> this thermodynamic proof includes most systems of relevance and it is valid for any determination of @xmath2 from _ linear _ transport measurements . in fact , our experiments demonstrate unequivocally that indeed when strictly linear transport is used , the apparent low - temperature saturation of @xmath2 is eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> however , the conditions to be in the linear transport regime are more strict than hitherto expected . </S>",
    "<S> another novel result of the experiments is that introducing heavy nonmagnetic impurities ( gold ) in our samples produces , even in linear transport , a shoulder in the dephasing rate at very low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we then show theoretically that low - lying local defects may produce a relatively large dephasing rate at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> however , as expected , this rate in fact vanishes when @xmath3 , in agreement with our experimental observations . </S>"
