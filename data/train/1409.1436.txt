    "* network formation .",
    "* there are plenty of studies on network formation models .",
    "first of all , stochastic network formation models have provided understanding of important aspects of evolving structure , starting from the seminal papers about mechanisms behind the small - world phenomena . in particular ,",
    "barabsi and albert ( 1999 ) showed that a hub node emerges in a growing network by preferential attachment process . in their model",
    ", since the probability of getting a new link is increasing in the number of existing links , the one who is more connected has the higher chance to get linked so that a network ends up with a highly centralized structure such as a scale - free network .",
    "on the other hand , a game theoretic approach emphasizes the importance of decision making in network formation .",
    "since linking is costly , individual agents optimize their connections , thus a network structure depends on the level of cost . in particular , two extreme structures arise such as the empty network under the high cost and the complete network under the low cost , and a star network appears at the moderate level of cost ( jackson and wolinsky , 1996 ; bala and goyal , 2000 ; watts , 2001 ) .",
    "note that for either stochastic network models or strategic network formation , an agent knows the whole structure of a network when a link is formed . unlike previous studies ,",
    "our model is interested in the case where full information about a network is unavailable : we add a cognitive perspective to the current network literature by developing a cognition - based strategic network formation model .    * cognition in a network . *",
    "while cognitive aspects in network formation have not been discussed , discussion about the relationship between size / layers of networks and human brain capacity has been relatively active ( rose and serafica , 1986 ; dunbar , 1998 ; 2009 ; stiller and dunbar , 2007 ; roberts and dunbar , 2011 ; sutcliffe , dunbar , binder , and arrow , 2012 ) .",
    "known as `` social brain hypothesis '' , there is biological evidence to show a relationship between the size of social groups and brain . regarding our question of cognition - based network formation , those works can support the cost of linking in strategic link formation if the capacity of a social brain related to the size and depth of a social network is interpreted as a cost .",
    "that is , the brain capacity of socializing can be a specific type of cost of linking .",
    "there are a few works more directly related to this research : since krackhardt ( 1987 ) has formalized individuals perception of a network firstly , krackhardt and kilduff ( 1999 ; 2008 ) have discussed how people perceive social networks and how network cognition affects an individual s behavior in a network .",
    "especially , recent experimental approaches to a cognition bias reveal that people perceive closer and denser than reality ( kilduff , crossland , tsai , and krackhardt , 2008 ) and perceived network structures are flatter than reality ( dessi , gallo , and goyal , 2012 ) .",
    "further than the disparity between cognition and the real network , we examine how an individual s perception converges to reality and how cognition and a network coevolve .",
    "* local interaction .",
    "* although triadic relations are widely observed in a social network , there are few theories about the formation of triadic relations .",
    "firstly , granovetter ( 1973 ) explains that two strongly connected agents are more likely to form an interaction circle with another agent . on the other hand , a recursive search model ( vzquez , 2003 ) and network - based meetings ( jackson and rogers , 2007 ) show the influence of existing links on the new link formation by combining random connections with local search .",
    "that is , since one connects with another through existing connections , any two agents who share a common neighbor are more likely to be connected , and this tendency is stronger if the already existing tie is strong .",
    "these studies emphasize a mediating node which plays a bridging role to form a cluster .",
    "our model provides a different explanation for clustering which does not need a mediator : the closer the distance between the most and the least accurate agents in a network , the more triadic relations appear .    * main results and contribution .",
    "* as mentioned , most network formation models tend to take full information about a network structure for granted , and we try to expand the discussion into how people perceive a network .",
    "in this research , people use their perceived network rather than the real network for link formation , and their cognition - based networking changes the real network structure , leading to changes in perception back .",
    "our model provides a theoretic framework for coevolution of a network and cognition : we derive the early stage of an evolving network and behavioral hypothesis and illustrate the model by an agent - based simulation .",
    "we briefly introduce key findings as follows .",
    "firstly , a network structure in the early stage of evolution is a ring , which implies that a dominantly centralized agent may not exist . in the further evolving process",
    ", a network evolves either in a complex structure by short cuts or in a global ring structure with local connections .",
    "secondly , since everyone knows his / her own link states correctly , the correct information is added on the updated perception until full information is completed . the full information with a small fluctuation caused by newly added links spreads , thus the gap between the most and the least accurate perception decreases , which weakens the incentive for a new link .",
    "thirdly , the cost of linking and the network evolution are negatively related .",
    "we find discontinuous jumps in terms of stable link density in accordance with the cost of linking : high cost leads to an empty network in a steady state , low cost results in a complex network , and a ring network arises at the moderate level of cost .",
    "additionally , we discuss how the frequency of linking affects a network structure .",
    "in particular , a clustering mechanism without a mediating node and a link concentration are investigated under a multiple agents perception update circumstance .",
    "if several agents update their perception in one time period , the most and the least accurate agents are closely located in a network .",
    "new links are added between closely located agents and a triadic relation arises in local connections .",
    "moreover , an agent who is slightly more connected than others by chance grows into a hub due to the exclusive information about newly added links .    from these findings",
    ", our paper contributes to network theory in three ways .",
    "firstly , we believe that this is the first work to explain network formation based on an individual s perception . this model is established on `` what people are really aware of '' rather than on `` what reality is '' .",
    "secondly , our findings on network formation improve our understanding of the interplay between individuals and a system .",
    "the result shows the complementarity between perception and a network structure such that differences between perception and reality trigger changes in a network and the structural changes accelerate the gap which leads to more changes in a network .",
    "finally , since this model suggests a general framework , there is potential applicability to various fields .",
    "for instance , any communication related networks such as coevolution of rumors and friendship in sociology and corporate governance and directorship in finance can be examined by this model .",
    "we consider a two - way flow communication network and an individual s perception of the network .",
    "communication for information transmission occurs between directly connected agents , and each individual has his / her own perception of who connects with whom . a network in one s perception does not necessarily coincide with the actual network , and it is natural to assume that the one who perceives a network more accurately can use it better . although perception details are not observed unless directly shared via a communication link , how well an agent utilizes a network reveals his / her overall accuracy of the perception .",
    "thus , perception itself is private information which can be shared via a link , whereas the accuracy of perception is observable to all agents by network utility .",
    "once individual agents observe others accuracy , less accurate agents may want to know the most accurate perception details in order to improve the network utility .",
    "if an agent has a link to the most accurate agent , he / she uses the existing link for the perception update .",
    "if an agent does not have a link to the most accurate one , he / she needs to create a new link which is costly .",
    "hence , the least accurate agent is willing to link to the most accurate agent only if the additional utility by updating perception exceeds the cost of linking .",
    "we are interested in how the network structure and agents perception evolve together .",
    "we firstly analyze a network in the early stage and an individual s perception update process , then characterize an evolving network structure .",
    "* network .",
    "* let @xmath2 be the set of individuals .",
    "in order to exclude perception updates without communication , we assume that @xmath0 is a sufficiently large number . at the same time ,",
    "when it comes to the cognitive problem , @xmath0 can not be a huge number in order for everyone in a network to recognize the existence of @xmath3 others regardless of the link states .",
    "we open @xmath0 as an arbitrary number .    for any pair of @xmath4",

    "we consider a time - evolving network @xmath14 in which only one link can be added in each time period . denoting @xmath19 as a network @xmath20 with a new link between @xmath16 and @xmath6 , @xmath21    individuals do not observe the actual network @xmath14 except their own link states to @xmath3 others , instead , each of them has their own perception of @xmath14 .",
    "* perception , accuracy and network utility . * in the same way of defining a network @xmath14 , individual agents perception on the network @xmath14 can be defined as @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "the network @xmath24 refers how @xmath16 perceives the actual network : if @xmath16 thinks that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are connected , @xmath25 , while @xmath26 implies that @xmath16 thinks there is no link between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the perception @xmath24 is private information which can be shared via a link .",

    "since a link is a conduit of communication to make individuals share their own perception with others , the network utility can be improved if one uses a link to obtain more accurate perception .",

    "firstly , figure [ ssntw1 ] ( a ) depicts the network in a steady state for the high cost of linking , i.e. @xmath232 $ ] .",
    "the overall structure is a ring with a few branches .",
    "figure [ ssntw1 ] ( b ) is the evolution of the average degree , showing how perception coevolves with the network structure .",
    "the average degree of individual agents perception , denoted by the blue dotted curve , quickly converges to the average degree of the actual network .",
    "note that although no new links are formed after @xmath203 , perception updates continue via existing links until all agents have almost correct information , which is shown in ( c ) as both degree distributions of perceptions and the actual network are close to each other .",
    "secondly , figure [ ssntw2 ] shows the network in a steady state for the low cost of linking , i.e. @xmath233 . the low cost of linking enables a continuous change in the network structure by adding links , thus the full information under the low cost is temporary . if a network continues evolving due to the low cost of linking , individuals are more willing to update perception because their information becomes incorrect quickly , leading to a higher benefit of link creation .",
    "thus , the least accurate agent more easily adds a link to the most accurate agent , which makes others perception more inaccurate .",
    "figure [ ssntw2 ] ( c ) shows how perception converges to the actual network , with a little gap between perception and the actual network which encourages agents to add more links , as explained .    in time periods",
    "@xmath185 $ ] , since the probability @xmath234 in ( [ qkk ] ) is low for low labeled agents , the correct information about the network spreads over many agents . whereas , @xmath235 is relatively high for high labeled agent , new links are formed as @xmath8 closes to @xmath183 , and these new links are more likely to be a short cut due to the correct information spreading . figure [ ssntw2 ] ( b ) verifies short cuts by showing the dramatically decreasing diameter .",
    "these short cuts significantly change the ring structure , and the structural change is accelerated in the further evolving process in @xmath184 .",
    "eventually , a very dense complicated structure in figure [ ssntw2 ] ( a ) arises in a steady state and degree distribution in figure [ ssntw2 ] ( d ) shows a relatively symmetric degree distribution .",
    "if all @xmath236 are allowed to update perception , new links are more likely to be a local interaction .",
    "as discussed in extension , if the single agent s update assumption is relaxed to allow multiple links to be created in one time period , we expect that the probability of creating short cuts will be very low compared to the single agent s update case .",
    "thus once the network is connected , it keeps the global ring structure with local connections . to see how the frequency of perception updates in one time period affects a network structure , we compare two networks which have the same density ( 250 in each network ) but one",
    "is formed by a single agent s update in figure [ hypo4 ] ( a ) and the other is formed by a multiple agents update in figure [ hypo4 ] ( b ) .",
    "the two networks are structurally different : in ( a ) , there are many short cuts which destroys the ring structure . in ( b ) , there are many triangle connections in the ring network .",
    "we consistently find that the clustering coefficient of the network in ( b ) is @xmath237 , which is higher than @xmath238 for the network in ( a ) .",
    "intuitively , we can interpret this result that people in a rapidly changing network are more likely to interact locally because the newest information is more accurate , whereas in a slowly changing network , information spreads throughout plenty of people so that interactions are not necessarily local .",

    "once this agent updates its accuracy and becomes the most accurate agent in @xmath243 , it attracts @xmath244 out of @xmath245 lowest accurate agents by chance .",
    "after the degree increases to @xmath246 , this agent becomes the single most accurate agent ( i.e. @xmath247 ) in @xmath248 to @xmath249 so that all the least accurate agents who is unconnected with this node form a link , emerging as a hub with degree @xmath250 .",
    "the two network snapshots in ( b ) and ( c ) illustrate this agent and all agents in @xmath49 denoted by green nodes .",
    "the degree trend in ( d ) verifies this process : in @xmath243 , the degree of this agent starts surging and reaches 74 just within a few time steps .",
    "the degree distribution of the network in ( e ) reveals a high link concentration .",
    "this paper has proposed a simple model to study the coevolution between a network and perception .",

    "we found that a network evolves in a line in the early stage and a ring structure arises once connected . due to correct information added by each individual ,",
    "the highest accuracy is improved and there must be an agent who possesses the full information in a connected network .",
    "we also showed discontinuous network density in a steady state and observed local interactions and a link concentration in a frequently changing network , which provides a plausible reasoning for clusters and a hub in a social network .",

    "<S> given a network utility as an increasing function of the perception accuracy , people infer others accuracy by observing their utility , thus we can consider the network utility as a proxy measure of the perception accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> it also leads to individuals incentive for linking to more accurately perceiving agents in order to improve their perception . </S>",
    "<S> since linking is costly , a link will be created only if the advantage of having more accurate perception exceeds the cost of linking . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , whenever a link is added to a current network , the newly added link affects individuals accuracy , hence both the advantage of high accuracy and the disadvantage of low accuracy are temporary as long as a network continues evolving . starting with an empty network in reality and an erds - rnyi random network with probability @xmath1 in cognition , </S>",
    "<S> the network dynamics ends when no one would like to add a link .    in section 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we briefly summarize related discussions and our results . </S>",
