    "just over two years ago the _ spitzer space telescope _ was used for the first direct detections of light from extrasolar planets @xcite , heralding the birth of a new field of observational astronomy : the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "so far these direct measurements are only possible for the shortest period `` hot jupiter '' exoplanets , as these planets are heated enough to radiate @xmath0 of their parent stars infrared emission , making the planet s component of the signal just separable from the stellar component . in the last couple of years",
    ", many new results have emerged in this field , including several more infrared direct detections of hot jupiters ( and a neptune ! ) through secondary eclipse measurements @xcite , measurements of infrared emission spectra @xcite , and orbital phase variation from the day - night temperature contrasts of eclipsing and non - eclipsing planets @xcite .",
    "further exciting results are expected from the last round of cryogenic _",
    "observations , the `` warm _ spitzer _ '' phase @xcite , and continuing on with the vastly increased photometric sensitivity of the _ james webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) .",
    "the launch of _ jwst _ will enable high precision measurements and the acquisition of detailed information about the atmospheres of these planets , including the ability to use the known geometry of eclipsing systems to make resolved maps of their day sides @xcite .    as the number of directly observed systems continues to grow , it is becoming increasingly apparent that not all hot jupiters are alike .",
    "differences in planetary radii , brightness temperatures or inferred efficiencies of heat redistribution from permanent day sides to cold night sides have led to theoretical speculations on possible ways to subclassify hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "perhaps we should not be surprised to discover diversity in these systems ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since even our own solar system planets exhibit a wide range of atmospheric conditions .",
    "for example , it is currently not well understood what sets the wind speeds at cloud - deck level on the solar system gas giants . since atmospheric circulation can be largely driven by insolation , one might expect those planets closer to the sun to experience stronger winds , but the fact that neptune receives much less solar illumination than jupiter and yet has faster winds illustrates how misleading simple arguments may be when applied to these complex , nonlinear flows ( @xcite ; see review by @xcite ) .",
    "even a thorough understanding of the atmospheric dynamics of the planets in the solar system would not necessarily allow us to extrapolate to hot jupiters , which are characterized by a very different atmospheric regime .",
    "these presumably tidally locked , short - period planets experience intense stellar irradiation on their constant day sides , much in excess of the internally generated heat flux , while their night sides remain in perpetual shadow . in addition , based on their relatively slow rotation periods , dynamical arguments suggest that large scale atmospheric structures can form on these planets @xcite , in contrast to the many thin jets and smaller structures observed on jupiter , for example .",
    "given this unusual combination of asymmetric heating and slow rotation , there have been several recent attempts to model the atmospheric flow on hot jupiters .    the combination of strong external irradiation ( which promotes vertical static stability ) , moderately slow rotation and large pressure scale heights in hot jupiter atmospheres results in rossby deformation radii comparable to or larger than the planetary radii themselves @xcite . the rossby deformation radius acts as a limiting scale for dynamics in a rotating stratified flow .",
    "it sets the typical horizontal size of large vortices in a turbulent atmosphere and determines the scale of the most unstable baroclinic modes .",
    "the large deformation radii in hot jupiter atmospheres may thus limit the importance of baroclinic instabilities and favor a largely barotropic atmospheric flow .",
    "these considerations led @xcite to apply the two - dimensional , equivalent - barotropic formulation of the primitive equations of meteorology @xcite to hot jupiter atmospheres .",
    "this vertically integrated formulation emphasizes the quasi - two dimensional , barotropic nature of the flow . while only adiabatic simulations have been reported so far",
    ", a great advantage of the equivalent - barotropic model is that small horizontal scales are resolved in a fully turbulent flow ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for turbulent energy spectra ) .",
    "an additional advantage of this approach is that the set of physical and numerical model parameters is limited and it includes the unknown magnitude of global average wind speed which is treated as an input parameter @xcite .",
    "this allows us to perform an analysis in which we explore a large range of possible equivalent - barotropic flows for hot jupiter atmospheres and study how these diverse flows may translate into a diversity of thermal phase curves for hot jupiters .",
    "we begin by describing the models used and our method for computing phase curves in @xmath1  2 , move on to discuss predicted model phase curves in @xmath1  3 , consider implications for current and future observations in @xmath1  4 , and finally conclude in @xmath1  5 .",
    "we use the adiabatic , equivalent - barotropic model of @xcite for the planet hd  209458b throughout our analysis .",
    "our main results for thermal phase curves do not strongly depend on the specific planetary parameters adopted  as long as one is concerned with hot jupiters of the same , broad dynamical class as hd  209458b ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a detailed description of the circulation model .",
    "briefly , the stellar radiative forcing imposes a steady day - night temperature difference on the flow . in the adiabatic equivalent - barotropic model , this forcing is represented by a forced bending of the model s bottom boundary surface , with a specified bend amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum day - night temperature variation of amplitude @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the average equivalent temperature of the modeled layer .",
    "the pre - existing background flow , with a prescribed average global wind speed , @xmath5 , produces temperature variations , which are superimposed on those due to the steady day - night difference .",
    "the combined temperature range covered by each model , as well as the range due to radiative forcing only ( case @xmath6 ) , are given in table  1 .",
    "the model runs have been performed at t63 spectral resolution ( equivalent to a fully - resolved 192 @xmath7 96 longitude - latitude grid ) , which has been found to be sufficient to capture the formation of dominant atmospheric structures @xcite . following the initialization procedure described in @xcite ,",
    "each run has been allowed to relax for 40 planetary orbits , after which we output a snapshot of the temperature structure on the planet , 100 times per orbit , for the next 60 orbits .",
    "we create the phase curves presented here by rotating each temperature map to the appropriate viewing orientation for its orbital phase angle and assumed inclination , and orthographically projecting it onto a two dimensional disk . unless otherwise specified , a @xmath8  inclination ( edge - on orientation ) is assumed by default .",
    "we sample the disk with a grid of @xmath9 $ ] resolution .",
    "we solve for three values of emergent flux from each disk element area : a bolometric value @xmath10 , and _",
    "band fluxes calculated either from a blackbody spectrum based on the local temperature @xmath11 or a spectral model interpolated from a grid of cloudless 1-d radiative transfer calculations @xcite . as we shall see , our main conclusions depend only weakly on the specific emission model adopted . after obtaining the flux",
    ", we integrate over the disk , weighting the emergent flux from each grid point by its relative area on the disk .",
    "our procedure is similar to that adopted in @xcite .",
    "we performed resolution tests of our phase curve analysis , both in the number of temperature maps sampled per orbit and the number of grid elements used to sample each map . for computational speed ,",
    "we use @xmath9 $ ] as the lowest possible resolution that is immune to noise from under - sampling .",
    "the phase curves produced using this resolution are accurate to within a few percent of those produced at higher resolutions .",
    "similarly , we find that by sampling the temperature map of the planet 50 times per orbit , we are able to adequately track the orbital flux variation without losing details in the structure of the phase curve . we have also found that 10 orbits are sufficient to sample the variable patterns seen in the phase curves , making it unnecessary to analyze the full 60 orbits of our model outputs .",
    "the temperature structures predicted by the equivalent - barotropic model consist of two superimposed components : a global day - night `` fixed '' temperature gradient ( the forced bending  see   2 ) whose strength depends on the imposed radiative forcing ( via the parameter @xmath2 ) , and a variable pattern of weather features created by atmospheric winds .",
    "the most prominent weather features are cold circumpolar vortices whose strength ( vorticity ) increases with higher values of @xmath5 .",
    "the vortices rotate around the poles with a period comparable , but not equal , to the spin ( = orbital ) period of the planet .",
    "while these vortices are the weather features that most strongly affect the emitted thermal flux in our models , other large scale , possibly transient , features generally exist in an atmosphere .",
    "for example , in the models presented here we observe a broader warm area that develops on the side of the planet opposite from the circumpolar vortices , and on occasion cold transient features that develop on the night side .",
    "these features constitute the weather on these model planets .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] shows temperature snapshots for the @xmath12 , @xmath5 = 800  model , exemplifying the type of weather features that develop .",
    "our discussion will primarily focus on the circumpolar vortices , as they are the dynamical features that most strongly affect the orbital phase curves , but it is worth noting that they do not completely determine the observable signatures in the model phase curves .",
    "the nature of the global temperature structure is determined by the relative strengths of the two superimposed components mentioned above .",
    "the models with high @xmath2 and low @xmath5 values have strong day - night temperature contrasts with weak variable weather patterns .",
    "their thermal emission phase curves are thus primarily a simple day - night ( peak - trough ) pattern with only minor deviations from weak weather features .",
    "the low @xmath2 , high @xmath5 models , on the other hand , retain some day - night temperature difference , but they can have temperature structures strongly influenced by the variable weather features .",
    "the corresponding phase curves are highly variable from one orbit to the next , since they are strongly dependent on the location of cold polar vortices relative to the day - night gradient . here",
    "we survey the @xmath13 parameter space to determine the range of possible characteristics of model phase curves .",
    "first we consider models with the radiative forcing parameter @xmath2 fixed ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : u_values ] shows the bolometric phase curves resulting from runs with average global wind strength @xmath5 ranging from 100 to 800 .",
    "one immediately apparent result is that the amount of predicted flux variation increases with @xmath5 .",
    "this is to be expected , since rotating cold polar vortices and other weather features have an increasingly dominant role in the temperature structures of models with stronger wind strengths .",
    "for example , when the vortices are on the night side , there is a stronger day - night temperature difference than would result from radiative forcing alone , and this allows for more orbital flux variation than in models where the vortex - induced temperatures are weak compared to the imposed day - night temperature difference .",
    "we do not consider global wind strengths in excess of 800 in this study .",
    "it is unclear whether much larger wind speeds can be realized in a turbulent , rotationally - balanced flow on hot jupiters .",
    "we have found that large wind speeds of a few km / s are not possible in our specific setup since they either lead to atmospheric holes in the initially balanced state or to a rapid blow up of the flow field @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in these adiabatic models the strength of the imposed day - night temperature is decoupled from the assumed global mean wind strength : it depends solely on @xmath2 .",
    "winds of greater strength may cause a decreased day - night temperature difference by , for example , more efficiently redistributing the heat between the two sides .",
    "this means that the trend of increasing phase curve amplitude with @xmath5 shown here may not be self - consistent .",
    "coupled , diabatic circulation models would address this issue more satisfactorily .",
    "the next feature that emerges in cases with higher @xmath5 is the presence of oscillations in the phase curves .",
    "whenever the cold vortices are visible on the planetary disk , they create a dip in the disk - integrated thermal flux .",
    "these dips can weaken the day side flux peak or strengthen the night side flux trough , when the vortices are predominantly at the sub- or anti - stellar point , respectively .",
    "the vortices and other weather features also produce small perturbations seen in the phase curves ( most apparent for the @xmath15  model ) , when apparent at some intermediate phase between peak and trough .",
    "the smallest of the identifiable perturbations is about 30  wide in orbital phase .",
    "it is not trivial to relate the phase size of this perturbation back to a physical scale in the planet s atmosphere , since there exists some degeneracy in interpretation between the size and brightness of any atmospheric feature .",
    "for instance , a small and extremely bright feature that is present during the entire passage across the visible disk could result in a phase curve perturbation of almost 180 . if the feature were dimmer , perhaps it would only significantly contribute to the observed flux when it was near the `` sub - observer '' point , and the size of the resulting perturbation would therefore be limited in phase . however , a diffuse feature of only slightly elevated brightness could produce a similar perturbation .",
    "thus the size and brightness of features can counterbalance each other , making it difficult to place constraints on either property .",
    "this exemplifies the ambiguity present in any interpretation of orbital phase curve data  each point in the orbit is a measure of the disk - integrated emission so that , in principle , it is possible to construct a variety of temperature structures that reproduce a given orbital variation .    in our model runs , when the circumpolar vortices are close to being aligned with the substellar point , but are some degrees of longitude displaced , the peak of the emitted phase curve is somewhat offset from the phase at which the substellar point faces the observer .",
    "the resulting apparent phase shift could be interpreted as a hot spot advected away from the substellar point , while in this example it is actually the result of the disk - integrated combination of emission from the hot substellar region and the asymmetry from the cold pattern .",
    "this point is worth emphasizing , as it shows that there can be degeneracy between models in the interpretation of even a single orbit s phase curve .",
    "examining figure  [ fig : u_values ] we find phase offsets of up to @xmath1640  ( with extreme offsets of orbit 8 at 85  and orbit 3 at 100 ) for the @xmath15  model run .",
    "the @xmath17 and 200  model runs typically produce phase shifts of @xmath1630  and @xmath1610 , respectively .",
    "next we consider the effect of increasing the amount of radiative forcing imposed on the model atmospheres , controlled by the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta_values ] shows phase curves for the full range of @xmath5 values for simulations with @xmath18 and 0.20 . as expected , the increased radiative forcing causes the regular day - night variation to dominate over the features produced by the variable weather structure .",
    "the day - night variation is completely dominant for the weakest wind models ; for @xmath19 , a wind speed of 800  is required to produce deviations of more than a few percent away from the peak - trough pattern . therefore , increasing the value of @xmath2 results in phase curves with larger amplitudes and a more regular peak - trough pattern .",
    "the cold vortices are too weak , compared to the day - night gradient , to produce the same small features seen in the phase curves of the @xmath14 models , and they now only work to change the amplitude of the variation from one orbit to the next , or to produce small shifts in the phase of the peak flux .",
    "the amount of phase offset is greatly reduced from the @xmath14 model . for @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath15  leads to @xmath1620  offsets , @xmath17  leads to @xmath1610  offsets and there are no shifts for @xmath20  or less . for @xmath19 , the only model whose curve shows a shift is @xmath15 , with an offset of @xmath1610 .",
    "in addition to sampling the @xmath21 parameter space itself , in this work we also consider the role of orbital inclination on model phase curves . a challenge in interpreting data from non - eclipsing systems",
    "is that the unknown inclination is partially degenerate with the amount of heat redistributed to the night side ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : incl_values ] we show the effect of varying the assumed inclination in our calculations of the phase curves for model runs with @xmath14 and 0.10 , and @xmath15 . we choose to plot the highest wind runs ( and likewise omit the @xmath19 run ) since the role of inclination on phase curves from atmospheres dominated by the day - night temperature contrast is simple : as the inclination is reduced ( i.e. , as the orbit is viewed from an increasingly polar orientation )",
    ", there is a trivial decrease in the amplitude of orbital phase variation .",
    "( at the @xmath22  extreme there is no variation since equal parts of the day and night sides are constantly in view . )",
    "we see this reduction in amplitude in our model curves as well , especially for the @xmath12 model , where the thermal emission is dominated by the day - night temperature contrast .",
    "another effect of decreasing the inclination is the emergence of more small features in the model phase curves . since the cold vortices revolve around the poles of the planet , as the orbital inclination",
    "is decreased , they are located closer to the center of the observed planetary disk , and therefore are given more weighting in the disk - integrated emitted flux . for a visual explanation of this effect , see figure  [ fig : images ] , where we have plotted temperature snapshots from one orbital rotation of the @xmath12 , @xmath15  model run , shown at @xmath23 90 , 60 , and 30 . here",
    "we show the @xmath12 model run because it has strong enough radiative forcing that the day - night gradient is clearly seen , while @xmath15  creates strong enough vortices that they are likewise easily visible in the global temperature maps .",
    "the top , middle , and bottom rows of figure  [ fig : images ] correspond to the top , middle , and bottom curves of figure  [ fig : incl_values]b , respectively .",
    "we see that at @xmath24 , the cold vortices are more centrally located on the apparent disk and the day - night temperature difference plays a much less significant role in producing variations of the disk - integrated flux . the decrease in day - night variation , combined with the more prominent role of cold vortices , results in the increased presence of small features in the model phase curve .      throughout our discussion",
    "so far we have been analyzing bolometric phase curves_i.e .",
    "_ , light curves calculated under the simple assumption that the emission from any area on the planetary disk is @xmath25 . here we also compute the light curves that would be measured in each _ spitzer _",
    "instrumental band to determine the wavelength dependence of these model curves .",
    "we calculate two values for the flux measured by each _",
    "spitzer _ band : one uses a blackbody for the emitted spectrum from each element area on the planetary disk , and the other one interpolates from a grid of model atmosphere spectra from @xcite .",
    "this is identical to the procedure adopted in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : bbody ] shows the wavelength - dependent phase curves for the @xmath14 , @xmath15  simulation , assuming local blackbody emission .",
    "the amplitude of variation decreases with increasing wavelength .",
    "we have verified that , in the range of temperatures covered by our model runs ( see table  1 ) , this is simply a consequence of the planck function varying more with temperature at shorter wavelengths than it does at longer wavelengths .",
    "this same general behavior is seen in figure  [ fig : smodel ] , in which we plot model phase curves for the same _ spitzer _ bands , but using the detailed spectral models for local emission .",
    "just as with a blackbody , the modeled spectra are more temperature - sensitive at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the detailed wavelength - temperature dependence of these spectral models differs from that of a blackbody , however , largely because of the presence of absorption bands , principally those due to water in the atmosphere .",
    "although the presence of water vapor spectral signatures in hot jupiter atmospheres is currently debated @xcite , the main point of figures  [ fig : bbody ] and  [ fig : smodel ] remains the same : for an atmosphere that spans the range of temperatures expected on hot jupiters , phase curves at shorter wavelengths may be generally more sensitive to temperature differentials .",
    "one needs to interpret this trend cautiously , however .",
    "it is only one of several effects that contribute to the detailed emission properties from such an atmosphere .",
    "for example , our modeling strategy based on a vertically - integrated formulation of the atmospheric flow does not capture well the possibility that shorter wavelengths may probe deeper into a planet s atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , where the circulation regime and the horizontal temperature field could in principle differ from higher up . while the model phase curves shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : bbody ] and  [ fig : smodel ] emphasize the role of horizontal temperature variations , additional wavelength - dependent effects are expected from variations of temperature with atmospheric depth .",
    "the vertical profile therefore has an effect on the wavelength dependence of phase curves which is unspecified in our models and the behavior shown here can thus only be associated with effect of horizontal temperature variations .",
    "three - dimensional radiation - hydrodynamics models will be required to address this issue reliably .",
    "the equivalent - barotropic circulation models of @xcite indicate the possible existence of large scale weather structures on hot jupiters . these structures could produce observable signatures in the thermal phase curves of hot jupiters , in the absence of obscuring elements such as clouds or haze ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have surveyed the parameter space of these models and find a diverse set of resulting phase curves .",
    "this diversity may be relevant in the interpretation of observations from various systems , especially as we are beginning to find that the label `` hot jupiter '' may in fact encompass a range of planetary types ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    even within the limited set of observed infrared phase curves",
    ", there is already evidence for significant diversity .",
    "the first published exoplanet phase curve was a set of five _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath26 observations of @xmath27 andromeda b during one of its 4.617-day orbits @xcite .",
    "these authors have found strong variation , indicative of little to no heat redistribution , and a small phase offset consistent with zero .",
    "@xcite used the irac instrument on _ spitzer _ to observe hd 209458 , hd 179949 , and 51 peg .",
    "their 8@xmath26 data placed an upper limit on the efficiency of heat redistribution on hd 179949b , while both hd 209458b and 51 peg b were given lower limits .",
    "there was no obvious phase shift evident in the data , and these authors chose to fit their data with zero phase - offset models .",
    "@xcite report 24@xmath26 phase curves , with observations at five epochs for @xmath27 and , @xmath28 bootes , and 51 peg , and at three epochs for the fainter systems hd 179949 and hd 75289 . like for 51 peg , and in contrast to @xmath27 and",
    ", there is some evidence for heat redistribution on @xmath28 boo .",
    "particularly interesting is the detection of an approximately -80  shift in the phase curve of @xmath28 boo .",
    "this is a phase lag , meaning that the minimum of the curve occurs after transit .",
    "recent most photometry of the system indicates that this phase variation may be due to the presence of an active region on the star @xcite .",
    "in such a case , it would be more difficult to disentangle the variation in emission due to any longitudinal temperature differences on the planet from additional variations due to the presence of magnetic structures . nevertheless , the possibility of both positive and negative phase offsets , as found in the phase curves presented here , and as opposed to systematically positive ones according to other dynamical models may provide important additional constraints on the regime of circulation present in these atmospheres .",
    "the most detailed observational results published to date are those of @xcite .",
    "while the interpretation of other phase observations has been limited by the necessity to fit model curves to a few noisy points spread throughout an orbital period , @xcite observed hd 189733b continuously for @xmath2933 hours , just over half an orbital period .",
    "these authors report an amplitude of variation indicating heat redistribution , although at an incomplete level .",
    "the flux maximum occurs 2.3 hours before secondary eclipse , while the minimum is 6.7 hours after transit ( = primary eclipse ) , which corresponds to two separate phase shifts : a + 16  phase shift for the flux maximum , and a @xmath3047  shift for the minimum .",
    "this means that the data can not be explained with a simple model that consists solely of a day - night temperature gradient , nor a model whose only atmospheric feature is a hot spot shifted away from the substellar point .",
    "the continuous nature of the @xcite data allows for the resolution of small features in the phase curve , which was not possible with other published measurements . by postulating a steady emission pattern over the observation time ( in the frame rotating with the synchronized planet ) , these authors reconstruct a longitudinal map of the brightness across the planetary disk .",
    "the disk - integrated flux reaches its minimum and maximum values in the same longitudinal hemisphere and a noticeable small scale feature @xmath2920  wide in phase is seen directly after transit .",
    "interestingly , we find that similar small scale perturbations can arise in the thermal phase curves of our equivalent - barotropic models . in particular , the @xmath14 , @xmath15  model ( figs .  [",
    "fig : u_values ] and  [ fig : bbody ] ) shows such features and produces an overall amplitude of phase curve variations that is qualitatively consistent with the @xcite data .",
    "the min - to - max variation in the data is @xmath2950% , a value consistent with the approximate 2080% range of single - orbit flux variation seen in this model .",
    "since the features of this model phase curve rely on the presence of large - scale moving atmospheric features , a consequence is that the shape of the phase curve would be expected to vary from one orbit to the next according to our models .",
    "this is in fact one of the main qualitative predictions of high - resolution , equivalent - barotropic models for hot jupiter atmospheres : with strong weather patterns , the temporal variability of the atmospheric temperature field should result in possibly detectable variations for repeated observations of a single system ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is particularly relevant in light of the recent 24@xmath26 observation of hd 189733b @xcite , in which another continuous measurement of the system over a similar half - orbit was performed .",
    "although the circulation regime ( e.g. , global average wind speeds ) could be different in the atmospheric layers probed at 8 and 24@xmath26 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the phase curve in @xcite is similar in amplitude and shape to the 8@xmath26 observation .",
    "thus the global temperature structure seems to have little vertical variation between the two corresponding `` photospheres . ''",
    "perhaps more importantly , as it pertains to our models , there is little difference in the observed emission pattern between these two orbits .",
    "this disfavors any atmospheric model for this planet that predicts significant orbit - to - orbit variations in temperature structure , and specifically the @xmath14 , @xmath15  model previously deemed qualitatively consistent with the 8@xmath26 observations . while the small feature seen after transit in the 8@xmath26 data",
    "is still indicative of some complexity in the global temperature structure , and the 24@xmath26 data are not of sufficient precision to observe a comparable feature @xcite , a comparison between these two phase curves points toward a mostly steady global circulation pattern on hd 189733b .",
    "the interpretation of any orbital phase curve data is subtle .",
    "measurements that consist of several discrete observations throughout one orbit may constrain the level of heat redistribution around the planet , but there are degeneracies even with the simplest models when trying to fit the data @xcite .",
    "this type of observation may not easily constrain the level of atmospheric complexity inherent in nonlinear circulation models  even for models as simple as the ones used here .",
    "the interpretation of observational data sets like those of @xcite becomes ambiguous if variable weather systems are present in hot jupiter atmospheres , since they can typically vary on orbital timescales .",
    "the assumption of a steady atmospheric field ( in the planet s rotating frame ) is necessary for the construction of a longitudinal temperature ( or brightness ) map , so that the resulting inferred properties could become inaccurate if moving features exist .",
    "repeated observations over multiple orbits help to constrain the steadiness of the global temperature field , as opposed to one which changes from orbit to orbit , like the high @xmath5 models presented here .",
    "the permanence of the day side field could also be constrained with repeated secondary eclipse measurements @xcite , which are less observationally expensive than phase curve measurements but lack information on the global day - night pattern . in the future , these two observational techniques should usefully complement each other when applied to eclipsing systems .    finally ,",
    "while we have focused our study on thermal phase curves , it is worth noting that the upcoming _ kepler _ mission could potentially also constrain the presence of large - scale weather features in ( very ) hot jupiter atmospheres .",
    "indeed , signatures similar to those in thermal phase curves may emerge in reflected light phase curves , if dynamical weather structures such as circumpolar vortices act as distinct thermodynamic regions of the atmospheric flow , with specific cloud and albedo properties .",
    "these issues would be best addressed in the future with improved atmospheric circulation models , coupled with radiation transfer calculations .",
    "the interpretation of hot jupiter phase curve data is subtle , especially if variable weather features are present in their atmospheres .",
    "we have explored the parameter space of the adiabatic , equivalent - barotropic models of @xcite to investigate the possible effects that large - scale features would have on hot jupiter thermal phase curves . despite their relative simplicity , we find that these models can produce phase curves with shapes that change from one orbit to the next , have apparent phase shifts , and contain small transient perturbations .",
    "the detection of such observational signatures would probe the regime of circulation present in these atmospheres .",
    "even the absence of such features would constrain the atmospheric dynamics regime .",
