    "spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) plays an important role in the widely studied spin - related effects and spintronic devices . in the latter",
    "it can be either directly utilized to create spatial separation of the spin - polarized charge carries or indirectly influence the device performance through spin - decoherence time . in 2d structures",
    "two kinds of soi are known to be of the most importance , namely rashba and dresselhaus mechanisms .",
    "the first one characterized by parameter @xmath0 is due to the structure inversion asymmetry ( sia ) while the second one characterized by @xmath1 is due to the bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) .",
    "most brightly both of the contributions reveal themselves when the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are comparable . in this case a number of interesting effects occur : the electron energy spectrum becomes strongly anisotropic @xcite , the electron spin relaxation rate becomes dependent on the spin orientation in the plane of the quantum well @xcite , a magnetic break - down should be observed in the shubnilov de haas effect@xcite .",
    "the energy spectra splitting due to soi can be observed in rather well - developed experiments as that based on shubnikov  de haas effect .",
    "however , these experiments can hardly tell about the partial contributions of the two mechanisms leaving the determination of the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be a more challenging task . at the same time , in some important cases spin relaxation time @xmath2 and spin polarization strongly depend on the @xmath3 ratio . in this paper",
    "we consider the tunneling between 2d electron layers , which turns out to be sensitive to the relation between rashba and dresselhaus contributions .",
    "the specific feature of the tunneling in the system under consideration is that the energy and in - plane momentum conservation put tight restrictions on the tunneling . without soi the tunneling conductance exhibits delta function - like maximum at zero bias broadened by elastic scattering in the layers @xcite , and fluctuations of the layers width @xcite .",
    "such a behavior was indeed observed in a number of experiments @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit interaction splits the electron spectra into two subbands in each layer . at",
    "that energy and momentum conservation can be fulfilled for the tunneling between opposite subbands of the layers at a finite voltage corresponding to the subbands splitting . however , if the parameters of soi are equal for left and right layers , the tunneling remains prohibited due to orthogonality of the appropriate spinor eigenstates . in @xcite it was pointed out that this restriction can also be eliminated if rashba parameters are different for the two layers .",
    "a structure design was proposed @xcite where exactly opposite values of the rashba parameters result from the built - in electric field in the left layer being opposite to that in the right layer .",
    "because the soi of rashba type is proportional to the electric field , this would result in @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the rashba parameters for the left and right layers respectively . in this case",
    "the peak of the conductance should occur at the voltage @xmath7 corresponding to the energy of soi : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is fermi wavevector . in this paper",
    "we consider arbitrary rashba and dresselhaus contributions and show how qualitatively different situations can be realized depending on their partial impact . in some cases",
    "the structure of the electrons eigenstates suppresses tunneling at ever voltage . at",
    "that the scattering is important as it restores the features of voltage - current characteristic containing information about soi parameters .",
    "finally the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be obtained in the tunneling experiment which unlike other spin - related experiments requires neither magnetic field nor polarized light .",
    "we consider two 2d electron layers separated by potential barrier at zero temperature ( see fig.[fig : layers ] ) .",
    "we shall consider only one level of size quantization and not too narrow barrier so that the electrons wavefunctions in the left and right layers overlap weakly .",
    "the system can be described by the phenomenological tunneling hamiltonian @xcite :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the partial hamiltonians for the left and right layers respectively , @xmath12 is the tunneling term . with account for the elastic scattering and soi in the layers",
    "the partial hamiltonians and the tunneling term have the the following form in representation of secondary quantization : @xmath13 here index @xmath14 is used for the layer designation and can take the values @xmath15 for the right layer , @xmath16 for the left layer . by @xmath17 here and further throughout the paper we denote the wavevector aligned parallel to the layers planes , @xmath18 denotes spin polarization and can take the values @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the energy of an electron in the layer @xmath14 having in - plane wavevector @xmath17 .",
    "it can be expressed as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 being electron s effective mass , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the size quantization energy and the energy shift due to external voltage for the layer @xmath14 .",
    "we shall also use the value @xmath26 defined as @xmath27 .",
    "similar notation will be used for spin polarization denoted by indices @xmath18 , @xmath28 . the second term in the hamiltonian ( [ eqh ] ) @xmath29 is the matrix element of the scattering operator .",
    "we consider only elastic scattering .",
    "the tunneling term @xmath12 in ( [ eqh ] ) is described by the tunneling constant @xmath30 , which has the meaning of size quantization levels splitting due to the wavefunctions overlap . by lowercase @xmath31",
    "we shall denote the overlap integral itself .",
    "our consideration is valid only for the case of weak overlapping , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "parametrically @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the electrons fermi energy .",
    "the term @xmath35 describes the spin - orbit part of the hamiltonian : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the pauli matrices , @xmath38 are respectively the parameters of rashba and dresselhaus interactions for the layer @xmath14 . in the secondary quantization representation : @xmath39 the operator of the tunneling current can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 we shall assume the case of in - plane momentum and the spin projection being conserved in the tunneling event so the tunneling constant @xmath30 has the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the cronecker symbol .",
    "the tunneling current is then given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the expectation value in quantum - mechanical sense .",
    "for further calculations it is convenient to introduce vector operator @xmath46 .",
    "this vector fully determines the current because the latter can be expressed through the difference @xmath47 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath48 is governed by : @xmath49\\ ] ] in the standard way of reasoning @xcite we assume adiabatic onset of the interaction with characteristic time @xmath50 .",
    "we will set @xmath51 in the final expression",
    ". with this ( [ drodt ] ) turns into : @xmath52\\ ] ] here @xmath53 represents the stationary solution of ( [ drodt ] ) without interaction . by interaction here",
    "we mean the tunneling and the elastic scattering by impurities but not the external voltage .",
    "the role of the latter is merely shifting the layers by @xmath54 on the energy scale . from such",
    "defined interaction it immediately follows that the only non - zero elements of @xmath53 are that with @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in further abbreviations",
    "we will avoid duplication of the indices i.e. write single @xmath14 instead of @xmath57 and @xmath17 instead of @xmath58 : @xmath59 with use of fermion commutation rules @xmath60 the calculations performed in a way similar to @xcite bring us to the following system of equations with respect to @xmath61 : @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a known matrix , depending on @xmath17 and parameters of spin - orbit interaction in the layers .",
    "here we also introduced the quadratic forms of the impurities potential matrix elements : @xmath65 as ( [ system1 ] ) and ( [ system2 ] ) comprise a system of linear integral equations these quantities enter the expression ( [ current ] ) for the current linearly and can be themselves averaged over spatial distribution of the impurities . in order to perform this averaging",
    "we assume the short range potential of impurities : @xmath66 the averaging immediately shows that the correlators @xmath67 and @xmath68 have different parametrical dependence on the tunneling transparency @xmath31 , namely @xmath69 we emphasize that this result holds for non - correlated distribution of the impurities as well as for their strongly correlated arrangement such as a thin layer of impurities placed in the middle of the barrier .",
    "the corresponding expressions for these two cases are given below .",
    "index rand stands for uniform impurities distribution and cor for their correlated arrangement in the middle of the barrier @xmath70 : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are bulk and surface concentrations of the impurities , @xmath74 is the lateral area of the layers , @xmath75 is the width of the barrier and @xmath76 is the eigenfunction corresponding to the size quantization level , @xmath77 is coordinate in the direction normal to the layers planes , @xmath78 corresponding to the middle of the barrier@xcite . unlike @xcite and according to ( [ t2 ] )",
    "we conclude that the correlator @xmath79 has to be neglected as soon as we shall be interested in calculating the current within the order of @xmath80 . in the hereused method of calculation",
    "this result appears quite naturally , however , it can be similarly traced in the technique used in @xcite ( see appendix ) . for the same reason the tunneling term should be dropped from ( [ system2 ] ) as it would give second order in @xmath81 if ( [ system2 ] ) substituted into ( [ system1 ] ) . according to ( [ correlators ] ) @xmath82 can be expressed in terms of electrons scattering time : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the 2d density of states @xmath85 . by means of fourier transformation on energy variable the system ( [ system1]),([system2 ] ) can be reduced to the system of linear algebraic equations .",
    "finally @xmath86 can be expressed as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "consequently the current ( [ current ] ) becomes a function of @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "for the considered case of zero temperature : @xmath90 where @xmath91 . without loss of generality we shall consider the case of identical layers and external voltage applied as shown in fig.[fig : layers ] : @xmath92 the calculations can be simplified with account for two small parameters : @xmath93 with ( [ eftau ] ) calculation yields the following expression for the current : @xmath94 where @xmath95}}{{\\mathop { \\left ( { f + 2d\\sin2\\varphi } \\right)}\\nolimits^2 k^4   - 2\\left ( { c^l } \\right)^2 \\left ( { c + 2a\\sin2\\varphi } \\right)k^2   + \\left ( { c^l } \\right)^4 } } , \\ ] ] @xmath96 @xmath97 parameters @xmath98-@xmath99 are various combinations of the rashba and dresselhaus parameters of soi in the layers .",
    "both types of soi are known to be small in real structures so that : @xmath100 this additional assumption together with ( [ deltaef ] ) reduces ( [ currentfinal0 ] ) to @xmath101d\\varphi } \\ ] ] the integral over @xmath102 in ( [ currentfinal ] ) can be calculated analytically by means of complex variable integration .",
    "however , the final result for arbitrary @xmath38 is not given here for it is rather cumbersome .",
    "in the next section some particular cases are discussed .",
    "the obtained general expression ( [ currentfinal ] ) can be simplified for a few particular important relations between rashba and dresselhaus contributions .",
    "these calculations reveal qualitatively different dependencies of the d.c .",
    "tunneling current on the applied voltage .",
    "the results of the calculations shown below were obtained using the following parameters : fermi energy @xmath103 mev , spin - orbit splitting was taken to resemble @xmath104 structures : @xmath105 mev .      in the absence of soi ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) the energy spectrum for each of the layers forms a paraboloid : @xmath108 according to our assumptions ( [ current0]),([current ] ) , the tunneling takes place at : @xmath109 both conditions are satisfied only at @xmath110 so that a nonzero external voltage does not produce any current despite it produces empty states in one layers aligned to the filled states in the other layer ( fig.[fig : layers ] ) . the momentum conservation restriction in ( [ conservation ] ) is weakened if the electrons scatter at the impurities .",
    "accordingly , one should expect a nonzero tunneling current within a finite voltage range in vicinity of zero .",
    "for the considered case the general formula ( [ currentfinal ] ) is simplified radically as all the parameters ( [ constants ] ) have zero values .",
    "finally we get the well - known result@xcite : @xmath111 the conductance defined as @xmath112 has lorentz - shaped peak at @xmath110 turning into delta function at @xmath113 .",
    "this case is shown in ( fig.[fig : tunnelingmain],a ) .",
    "all the curves in fig.[fig : tunnelingmain ] show the results of the calculations for very weak scattering .",
    "the corresponding scattering time is taken @xmath114 .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction gives qualitatively new option for the d.c .",
    "conductance to be finite at non - zero voltage .",
    "soi splits the spectra into two subbands .",
    "now an electron from the first subband of the left layer can tunnel to a state in a second subband of the right layer .",
    "let us consider a particular case when only rashba type of soi interaction exists in the system , its magnitude being the same in both layers , i.e. @xmath115 , @xmath107 . in this case",
    "the spectra splits into two paraboloid - like subbands `` inserted '' into each other .",
    "fig.[fig : spectrarashba ] shows their cross - sections for both layers , arrows show spin orientation . by applying a certain external voltage @xmath116 , @xmath117",
    "the layers can be shifted on the energy scale in such a way that the cross - section of the `` outer '' subband of the right layer coincides with the `` inner '' subband of the left layer ( see solid circles in fig.[fig : spectrarashba ] ) . at that both conditions ( [ conservation ] ) are satisfied . however ,",
    "if the spin is taken into account , the interlayer transition can still remain forbidden .",
    "it happens if the appropriate spinor eigenstates involved in the transition are orthogonal .",
    "this very case occurs if @xmath118 , consequently the conductance behavior remains the same as that without soi .",
    "contrary , if the rashba terms are of the opposite signs , i.e. @xmath4 the spin orientations in the `` outer '' subband of the right layer and the `` inner '' subband of the left layer are the same and the tunneling is allowed at a finite voltage but forbidden at @xmath110 .",
    "this situation , pointed out in @xcite should reveal itself in sharp maxima of the conductance at @xmath119 as shown in fig.[fig : tunnelingmain],b . from this dependence",
    "the value of @xmath0 can be immediately extracted from the position of the peak . evaluating ( [ constants ] ) for this case and further the expression ( [ currentfinal ] ) we obtain the following result for the current : @xmath120}}{{\\left [ { \\left ( { eu - \\delta } \\right)^2 + \\left ( { \\frac{\\hbar } { \\tau } } \\right)^2 } \\right]\\left [ { \\left ( { eu + \\delta } \\right)^2   + \\left ( { \\frac{\\hbar } { \\tau } } \\right)^2 } \\right]}},\\ ] ] where @xmath121 . the result is in agreement with that derived in@xcite , taken for uncorrelated spatial arrangement of the impurities .",
    "as we have already noted we do not take into account interlayer correlator @xmath79 ( @xmath122 ) because parametrically it has higher order of tunneling overlap integral @xmath31 than the intralayer correlator @xmath123 .",
    "therefore the result ( [ currentraikh ] ) is valid for arbitrary degree of correlation in spatial distribution of the impurities in the system .",
    "it is worth noting that the opposite case when only dresselhaus type of soi exists in the system leads to the same results .",
    "however , it is rather non - practical to study the case of the different dresselhaus parameters in the layers because this type of soi originates from the crystallographic asymmetry and therefore can not be varied if the structure composition is fixed . for this case to be realized one needs no make the two layers of different materials .",
    "the presence of dresselhaus term in addition to the rashba interaction can further modify the tunneling conductance in a non - trivial way .",
    "a special case occurs if the magnitude of the dresselhaus term is comparable to that of the rashba term .",
    "we shall always assume the dresselhaus contribution being the same in both layers : @xmath124 .",
    "let us add the dresselhaus contribution to the previously discussed case so that @xmath125 .",
    "the corresponding energy spectra and spin orientations are shown in fig.[fig : spectrard ] .",
    "note that while the spin orientations in the initial and final states are orthogonal for any transition between the layers , the spinor eigenstates are not , so that the transitions are allowed whenever the momentum and energy conservation requirement ( [ conservation ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "it can be also clearly seen from fig.[fig : spectrard ] that the condition ( [ conservation ] ) , meaning overlap of the cross - sections a. and b. occurs only at few points .",
    "this is unlike the previously discussed case where the overlapping occurred within the whole circular cross - section shown by solid lines in fig.[fig : spectrarashba ] .",
    "one should naturally expect the conductance for the case presently discussed to be substantially lower . using ( [ currentfinal ] ) we arrive at a rather cumbersome expression for the current :    @xmath126 , \\label{currentspecial}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath127 alternatively , for the case of no interaction with impurities a precise formula for the transition rate between the layers can be obtained by means of fermi s golden rule .",
    "we obtained the following expression for the current : @xmath128 where @xmath129 comparing the results obtained from ( [ currentspecial ] ) and ( [ currentprecise ] ) is an additional test for the correctness of ( [ currentspecial ] ) .",
    "both dependencies are presented in fig.[fig : goldenrule ] and show a good match .",
    "the same dependence of conductance on voltage is shown in fig.[fig : tunnelingmain],c . as can be clearly seen in the figure",
    "the conductance is indeed substantially suppressed in the whole voltage range .",
    "this is qualitatively different from all previously mentioned cases .",
    "furthermore , the role of the scattering at impurities appears to be different as well . for the considered above cases characterized by resonance behavior of the conductance",
    ", the scattering broadens the resonances into lorentz - shape peaks with the characteristic width @xmath130 .",
    "contrary , for the last case the weakening of momentum conservation , caused by the scattering , increases the conductivity and restores the manifestation of soi in its dependence on voltage .",
    "fig.[fig : tunnelingmain],d shows this dependence for a shorter scattering time @xmath131 .",
    "the reason for that is the weakening of the momentum conservation requirement due to the elastic scattering .",
    "one should now consider the overlap of the spectra cross - sections the circles in fig.[fig : spectrard ] having a certain thickness proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "this increases the number of points at which the overlap occurs and , consequently , the value of the tunneling current . as the calculations show , for arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath1 the dependence of conductance on voltage can exhibit various complicated shapes with a number of maxima , being very sensitive to the relation between the two contributions .",
    "the origin of such a sensitivity is the interference of the angular dependencies of the spinor eigenstates in the layers .",
    "a few examples of such interference are shown in fig.[fig : variousrd ] , a  c .",
    "all the dependencies shown were calculated for the scattering time @xmath131 s. fig.[fig : variousrd],a summarizes the results for all previously discussed cases of soi parameters , i.e. no soi ( curve 1 ) , the case @xmath133 ( curve 2 ) and @xmath134 ( curve 3 ) .",
    "following the magnitude of @xmath135 all the reasonances are broadenered compared to that shown in fig.[fig : tunnelingmain ] .",
    "fig.[fig : variousrd],b ( curve 2 ) demonstrates the conductiance calculated for the case @xmath136 , fig.[fig : variousrd],c ( curve 2 )  for the case @xmath137 . the curve 1 corresponding to the case of no soi is also shown in all the figures for reference . despite of a significant scattering parameter all the patterns shown in fig.[fig : variousrd ]",
    "remain very distinctive .",
    "that means that in principle the relation between the rashba and dresselhaus contributions to soi can be extracted merely from the i - v curve measured in a proper tunneling experiment .",
    "as we have shown , in the system of two 2d electron layers separated by a potential barrier soi can reveal itself in the tunneling current .",
    "the difference in spin structure of eigenstates in the layers results in a sort of interference in the tunneling conductance .",
    "the dependence of tunneling conductance on voltage appears to be very sensitive to the parameters of soi .",
    "thus , we propose a way to extract the parameters of soi and , in particular , the relation between rashba and dresselhaus contributions in the tunneling experiment .",
    "we emphasize that unlike many other spin - related experiments the manifestation of soi studied in this paper should be observed without external magnetic field .",
    "our calculations show that the interference picture may be well resolved for gaas samples with the scattering times down to @xmath138 s , in some special cases the scattering even restores the traces of soi otherwise not seen due to destructive interference .",
    "this work has been supported in part by rfbr , president of rf support ( grant mk-8224.2006.2 ) and scientific programs of ras .",
    "in this section we discuss an approach to the calculation of the tunneling current based on green s function formalism .",
    "as we shall see this approach used in@xcite gives the same results as that based on the operator motion equation ( [ drodt ] ) .",
    "however , one should be accurate with averaging over spatial distribution of the impurities .",
    "the starting point for this calculation is the tunneling hamiltonian ( [ ht0 ] ) in which the coupling between the two layers sits merely in the tunneling term @xmath12 ( [ eqh ] ) .",
    "whenever such hamiltonian is assumed , its part connected to the scattering at the impurities is the following @xmath139 where @xmath140 are the matrix elements of the scattering operator calculated on the electrons eigenfunctions .",
    "note that this hamiltonian does not contain interlayer matrix elements @xmath141 , which would have appeared after straightforward secondary quantization of the impurities external field ( [ impuritiespotential ] ) .",
    "this is reasonable because these elements are parametrically small compared to intralayer elements @xmath142 and also to the tunneling term @xmath12 . to prove the first we recall from ( [ correlators1 ] ) that @xmath143 while the intra - layer matrix elements @xmath144 .",
    "taking into account ( [ t2 ] ) we have : @xmath145 the interlayer matrix elements are also parametrically small compared to the tunneling term in the hamiltonian . indeed , from ( [ tau]),([t2 ] )",
    "also follows that @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) , while as was mentioned earlier @xmath148 , hence : @xmath149 the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be rewritten as : @xmath150 the calculation of the current can be carried out by means of perturbation theory with @xmath151,@xmath12 treated as two perturbations . at first step",
    "only the tunneling term @xmath12 is considered as a perturbation while the rest of the hamiltonian describes the system treated as unperturbed .",
    "the tunneling constant @xmath81 is a small parameter as soon as our consideration is restricted to the case of weak tunneling .",
    "tunneling current can be calculated adjusting the kubo formula to the tunneling current@xcite .",
    "the kubo formula treats the perturbation to the leading order so that the leading order for the current is @xmath80 .",
    "we obtain the following formula for the d.c .",
    "tunneling current expressed through the unperturbed greena functions : @xmath152 where @xmath153 is electron lateral momentum , @xmath154 are the components of the unperturbed green s functions ( which are matrices in our case ) .",
    "index @xmath155 tells that at this stage , while only @xmath12 is considered as a perturbation , these unperturbed green s functions include the scattering by impurities . at the second step the green s functions @xmath156 are to be expressed in terms of the known unperturbed green s functions @xmath157 of the non - interacting 2d electron gas .",
    "the conventional perturbation theory leads to the summation of diagrams of the two types shown in fig.[fig : diagrams ]    the branches correspond to the unperturbed green s functions @xmath157 while the crosses correspond to the matrix elements @xmath29 .",
    "the ladder diagrams of type b. give vertex corrections discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , in our opinion , the ladder diagrams do not give any significant impact to the tunneling current .",
    "it can be easily shown that if the interaction part of the hamiltonian is as given by ( [ scatteringhamiltonian ] ) , the upper branches of the diagrams in fig.[fig : diagrams ] ( corresponding to @xmath158 ) contain only @xmath159 while the lower branches have only @xmath160 .",
    "hence the diagrams of type a. contain the quadratic forms of the intralayer matrix elements @xmath161 ( [ correlators ] ) while the diagrams of type b. contain only interlayer elements @xmath162 .",
    "it follows from ( [ t2 ] ) that after averaging over the impurities ( with any degree of their spatial correlation ) the interlayer matrix elements give higher order with regard to the tunneling parameter @xmath81 and therefore must be omitted in the leading order calculations .",
