    "the effects of thermal fluctuation near the superconducting phase transition have been an interesting issue for many years , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "these effects attract much attention particularly for strongly type - ii superconductors of recent interest , for example , the high-@xmath1 cuprate superconductors , the organic superconductors , and the heavy fermion superconductors , because the effects of thermal fluctuation are enhanced by the short coherence length and the anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the superconducting fluctuation leads to a divergence of a number of physical quantities , such as , the specific heat , the susceptibility , the dc nonlinear electrical conductivity , and the ac linear electrical conductivity .",
    "one of the remarkable features of the superconducting fluctuation is a scaling behavior appearing in these diverging quantities .",
    "detailed analyses of such scaling behavior provide important information on the universality class of the second order phase transition . among these physical quantities ,",
    "ac conductivity is one of the most powerful probes to investigate the fluctuation effect , because the frequency and temperature dependences of complex conductivity enable the direct verification of a dynamic scaling theory @xcite .",
    "although the theory predicts the scaling behavior in other dc quantities , as well as in the frequency dependence of the ac conductivity , @xmath5 , the latter has an additional advantage .",
    "the scaling analysis generally needs two scaling parameters to be determined .",
    "it is , however , impossible to determine these two parameters uniquely from the dc ( not complex ) experimental data .",
    "therefore , the scaling analyses of dc data usually assume a particular dimension in order to establish a certain relationship between these two parameters .",
    "this reduces the degrees of freedom in the scaling analyses from two to one , leading to less convincing analyzed results .",
    "contrary to this , complex @xmath5 can provide the unique determination of the scaling parameters without any assumptions .",
    "recently , the dynamic scaling analyses on ac conductivity have been performed for some kinds of high-@xmath1 cuprates .",

    "this is , in part , due to the lack of systematic studies on high-@xmath1 cuprates and fundamental studies on conventional superconductors which are very important as reference results for many more exotic superconductors of recent interest .",
    "previous studies on the ac fluctuation conductivity of conventional superconductors have been published .",
    "for instance , lehoczky and briscoe @xcite measured the temperature dependence of fluctuation conductivity on lead films at several fixed microwave frequencies .",
    "tanner @xcite measured the temperature dependence of the characteristic frequency of the fluctuation on lead films by far - infrared transmission .",
    "although these studies were in agreement with the calculation on gaussian theory @xcite , the frequency dependence was insufficient to examine the scaling analysis .",
    "in addition , these studies compared the measured conductivity or some other physical quantities with the theoretical prediction based on a particular microscopic model . in contrast , dynamic scaling analysis works without any explicit calculations of the individual models .",
    "this is the most significant merit of dynamic scaling .",
    "however , there are no studies of dynamic scaling analysis of ac fluctuation conductivity on conventional superconductors in zero magnetic field , though this approach has been applied to the vortex - glass transition in conventional superconductor , indium @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report the frequency and temperature dependences of ac conductivity of films of a conventional superconductor , nbn , and perform dynamic scaling analysis on excess conductivity due to the superconducting fluctuation effects in zero magnetic field .",
    "the comprehensive examinations of the fluctuation conductivity , including the scaling behavior itself , critical exponents , and also the explicit temperature and frequency dependences of fluctuation conductivity , clarify the validity and the limit of the dynamic scaling analysis .",
    "the first successful theory of the dc fluctuation conductivity in superconductors was provided by aslamazov and larkin @xcite .",
    "they considered the thermal relaxation of the order parameter to calculate the direct contribution of the superconducting pairs created by fluctuations ( al - term ) , as follows , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the thickness , @xmath13 is the coherence length at @xmath14 k , and @xmath15 .",

    "the mt term explained a larger magnitude and an anomalous temperature dependence of the fluctuation conductivity observed on cleaner superconductors @xcite .",
    "as for the dynamic aspect of the fluctuation , the frequency dependence of the al - term was calculated by schmidt @xcite using the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation , as follows ,    @xmath19 ,                              \\nonumber \\\\",

    "it is expected that higher @xmath1 , shorter coherence length , longer magnetic penetration depth , and quasi - two dimensionality enhance the temperature region where the gaussian theory is not valid . to study such a critical region , fisher , fisher and huse @xcite formulated a dynamic scaling rule on fluctuation conductivity in the vicinity of a second order phase transition , as follows , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a complex universal scaling function , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 are scaling parameters whose temperature dependences are related to that of a correlation length , @xmath25 , which diverges at @xmath1 , as follows , @xmath26^{z+2-d } ,                              \\nonumber \\\\",
