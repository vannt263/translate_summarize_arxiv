    "let @xmath0 be a polygon with @xmath1 vertices in @xmath2 .",
    "we express @xmath0 by its vertices , @xmath3 , with suffixes modulo @xmath1 .",
    "a polygon @xmath0 is called _ equilateral _ if the edge length @xmath4 is constant , and _ equiangular _ if the angle @xmath5 is constant .",
    "this angle between two adjacent edges is called the _ bond angle _ and will be denote by @xmath6 in this paper .",
    "an equilateral and equiangular polygon can be considered as a mathematical model of a cycloalkane .",
    "we are interested in the set of all the possible shapes ( which are called conformations in chemistry ) of cycloalkanes when the number @xmath1 of carbons and the bond angle @xmath6 is fixed , i.e. in the language of mathematics , the configuration space of equilateral and equiangular polygons .",
    "gordon crippen studied it for @xmath7 ( @xcite ) . to be precise ,",
    "what he obtained is not the configuration space itself , but the space of the `` _ metric matrices _ '' , which are @xmath8 matrices whose entries are inner products of pairs of edge vectors , and then he gave the corresponding conformations .",
    "when @xmath9 ( cyclobutanes ) and @xmath10 ( cyclopentanes ) he considered all the possible bond angles , but when @xmath11 ( cyclohexanes ) and @xmath12 ( cyclopentanes ) he fixed the bond angle to be the ideal tetrahedral bond angle @xmath13 ( figure [ tetrahedron ] ) .",
    "he showed that if @xmath11 the conformation space is a union of a circle which contains a _ boat _ ( figure [ boat6 ] ) and an isolated point of a _ chair _",
    "( figure [ chair6 ] ) , and that if @xmath12 it consists of two circles , one for boat / twist - boat and the other for chair / twist - chair . in these two cases",
    ", he showed it by searching out all the possible values of the entries of the metric matrix through numerical experiment with 0.05 step size .",
    "0.5 cm        0.5 cm        in this paper we study the configuration space of hexagons for any bond angle .",
    "we give explicit expressions of all the possible configurations in terms of our parameters illustrated in figure [ double - cone ] .",
    "we show that the topological type of the configuration space depends on the bond angle @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 is big ( @xmath14 ) the situation is same as that of cyclohexanes of ideal tetrahedral bond angle studied by crippen . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath6 is small ( @xmath15 ) , a new configuration ( `` _ inward crown _ '' illustrated in figure [ cylinder ] ) appears , and the one dimensional continuum of deformation of a boat is divided into two pieces , which implies that we can not deform a boat into its mirror image .",
    "we remark that we distinguish vertices in our study .",
    "hence our configuration space is not equal to the space of shapes .",
    "we have an exceptional case if @xmath16 , when the inward crown , which degenerates to a doubly covered triangle , can be deformed to boats via newly appeared families of configurations .    in any case",
    ", a chair is an isolated configuration , whereas a boat allows one - dimensional deformations starting from and ending at it .",
    "moving pictures of deformation of a boat can be found at    ` http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/knotnrg/math/configuration.html `    of course , as extremal cases , we have a @xmath17 times covered multple edge and a regular hexagon when @xmath18 .",
    "there have been a great number of studies of the configuration spaces of _ linkages_. an excellent survey can be found in @xcite .",
    "if we drop the condition of being equiangular , it is known that the space of equilateral polygons has a symplectic structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is based on the author s talk at `` knots and soft - matter physics , topology of polymers and related topics in physics , mathematics and biology '' , yitp , kyoto , 2008 ( a short announcement of the result without proof was reported in _",
