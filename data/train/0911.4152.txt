    "since the reports@xcite of epitaxially grown mn@xmath0ge@xmath1 with @xmath2 @xmath3 3.5% in crystalline form showing the curie temperature , t@xmath4 , up to 116 k , mn@xmath0a@xmath1 alloys , where a is a group - iv element , have attracted much attention as potential candidates for spintronic materials . in particular , there were interesting experiments @xcite measuring the transport and magnetic properties of mn@xmath0si@xmath1 grown by post thermal treatment of amorphous mn - si films , ion implantation , and arc - melting methods .",
    "in addition , the growth of fe in si has also been carried out by su et al .",
    "@xcite who used the molecular beam epitaxial method to successfully grow film forms of fe@xmath0si@xmath1 with x at 4.0 and 7.0% , respectively .",
    "their samples show uniform distribution of the transition metal element ( tme ) .",
    "theoretically , there have been many model calculations of mn doped in si@xcite .",
    "many of them examined the relative energetics involving more than one mn atom .",
    "weng and dong @xcite also report diverse magnetic properties , such as both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases , based on energetic arguments , and magnetic moments in si doped with cr and fe .    because si technologies are the most mature among all the semiconductors the prospect of realizing spintronic devices using si - based alloys is more promising than doping tme in other semiconductors . to use a material for fabricating spintronic devices , one should consider the following issues : ( a ) can the material be easily grown ? ( b )",
    "how large can the saturation magnetic moment / vol or the magnetic moment / tme be ?",
    "( c ) how can possible distortions near the doping sites , contraction or expansion , be predicted before growth ? and",
    ", ( d ) what is the relative stability between the doping sites , in particular a substitutional ( s ) and a tetrahedral interstitial ( i ) sites ?",
    "there is also a higher energy and less stable six - fold coordinated interstitial site @xcite which we do not consider in this paper .",
    "why is ( c ) important ?",
    "our earlier work on mnc@xcite shows that small volume around mn can diminish the magnetic moment of the compound because there is not enough space available for all electrons localized at the tme to align their spins , causing spin flips and reducing the saturation magnetic moment .",
    "this also demonstrates that issues ( b ) and ( c ) can be inter - related .",
    "such entangled issues make it difficult to use only physical intuition to guide the growth .",
    "furthermore , there is a calculation indicating that an s site is less stable than the i site based on energetic considerations@xcite .",
    "however , we found that in order to explain the large magnetic moment / mn determined by bolduc et al .",
    "@xcite in mn@xmath0si@xmath1 with x = 0.1% it is necessary for the mn to occupy an s site@xcite . despite such complications , exploring more new spintronic materials by doping various tmes in si",
    "is still an appealing option .",
    "because the issues involved are just coming into focus , it would be a major undertaking to use a trial and error approach to grow new si - based alloys without a judicious choice of tmes . in this paper",
    ", we provide a basic understanding of the energetic and magnetic properties of singly doped fe and mn in si . a brief discussion of the models and the method of calculation are given in section ii .",
    "results and discussion will be given in section iii . in section iv , we summarize the results and make some suggestions concerning the growth .",
    "we construct models of single tme dopants by starting with a conventional cell of the diamond crystal having 8-atoms / unit - cell and increasing the cell size up to 216-atom / unit - cell by stacking the conventional cells in three directions . as an example",
    ", models for the 8-atom case including the atoms at the boundaries of the unit cell and with one tme at the s and i sites are shown in fig . 1 on the left and the right , respectively .",
    "the different supercell sizes simulate in some way the degree of isolation of the single atom dopants in the alloys , although the supercell approach precludes directly modeling random alloys because it is implicitly periodic ordered in real space .",
    "there is a possibility that disorder in the real alloys may affect the validity of our results , particular at high concentrations .",
    "the popular coherent potential ( cpa ) @xcite and virtual crystal approximations @xcite , include disorder through scattering or crystal structure , but both of these may introduce unphysical effects .",
    "a more direct method is the special quasirandom structures ( sqs ) approach @xcite .",
    "previous work @xcite found deviations of order 0.01from vegard s law , which states that the alloy lattice constant scales linearly with @xmath2 between the a and b lattice constants for a binary alloy of @xmath5 , in group iv semiconductors alloyed with sn using the sqs method .",
    "we expect that including disorder may change our results by less than 0.01 , because some deviation from vegard s law can already be accommodated within the ordered alloys we model . in any case , our single dopant results will be most reliable for low concentration limits , in which the random nature of the alloys should be unimportant .",
    "we used the vasp code @xcite to determine the basic structural and magnetic properties of the alloys using ultrasoft pseudopotentials of si , fe and mn with the normal electronic configurations . the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew 91@xcite",
    "was used to treat the exchange - correlation of the electrons . a planewave basis with 650 ev cutoff energy and a ( 15,15,15 ) monkhorst - pack * k*-point mesh @xcite was used for the 8-atom case .",
    "as the cell size increased , we reduced the mesh points according to the inverse ratio of the lattice constant of the large cell to the one of the 8-atom case . because of the doping , the forces acting on the atoms may initially be large .",
    "we therefore relax the positions of the atoms in each unit cell to reduce the forces acting on all atoms to less than 6.0 mev /  .    in the spirit of first - principles calculations",
    ", the lattice constant of the crystalline si was optimized with respect to the total energy .",
    "it is 5.45 , which is 0.4% larger than the experimental value .",
    "this lattice constant was used to determine the bond length , 2.36 , between any pair of si atoms in the supercells before the tme was inserted and the force relaxation was subsequently carried out .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in general , for the tme at an s site , the ionic model @xcite applies .",
    "each of the four neighboring si take one electron away to participate in d - p hybridization leaving the rest of electrons near the tme to align their spins according to the first hund s rule and reduce their coulomb repulsion .",
    "the model predicts the moments for mn and fe to be 3.00 and 4.00 ( @xmath6/tme ) , respectively .",
    "these two results serve as references .    refs . @xcite",
    "give the measured magnetic moment / mn , m , in mn@xmath0si@xmath1 .",
    "the values range from the maximum 5.0 @xmath6/mn at x = 0.1% to 1.5 @xmath6/mn at x = 0.8% .",
    "they are summarized in table iii .",
    "the unusually large value of the moment , 5.0 @xmath6/mn , at x=0.1% requires the mn to occupy an s site and is not completely due to the mn alone @xcite .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments for all cases are given table ii .",
    "for the 8-atom case with mn at the s site , the constricted relaxation due to the small cell size causes the magnetic moment to be 0.03@xmath6/mn less than the value predicted from the ionic model .",
    "this indicates there is an interaction between cells . when the size of the cell increases , the calculated magnetic moment agrees with the predicted value for the mn .    on the other hand , the magnetic moments at an s site for the fe doping",
    "is only 1.76 @xmath6/fe , much smaller than the predicted 4.0 @xmath6/fe , and are zero for an fe in 64- and 216-atom cells .",
    "as shown in table i for the fe at an s site , the bond lengths are 2.32 , 2.26 and 2.25 for the 8- , 64- and 216-atom cells , respectively . for the 8-atom case ,",
    "the situation is similar to the case of mn doping .",
    "the restricted contraction and the interaction between the neighboring cells together determine the magnetic moment . for larger supercells ,",
    "the significant contraction of the bond length renders the volume around the fe atom too small to align either the four or even the two spin moments and still obey the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the four electrons oppositely pair their spins in order to coexist in the confined volume .",
    "the resultant spin moment for the alloy is zero .",
    "when a mn is at an i site , the magnetic moment is larger than 3.00 @xmath6/mn for the 8-atom case while it is 3.00 @xmath6/mn in the other two cases , respectively . as shown in fig . 4 , four of the d - electrons shift their charges into the open regions between bonds formed by the neighboring si atoms .",
    "the three electrons left at the mn atom align to give 3.00 @xmath6/mn . for the 8-atom case",
    ", the cell is small .",
    "the four shifted electrons are polarized by the spin moment localized at the mn through the exchange interaction via the weak overlap of their wave functions .",
    "with fe at the i site , the bond lengths expand but not as much as with mn .",
    "for the 8-atom case , the calculated moment is 2.05 @xmath6/fe . the volume around the fe determined by the bond length of 2.36is sufficient to align two spins .",
    "the overlap of the wave functions associated with the local spins and the d - states shifting into the interstitial space provide the weak exchange interaction causing the extra 0.05 @xmath6/fe .",
    "for the two larger cells , even with greater volumes around the fe , there is still not enough space to accommodate the alignment of all four spins .",
    "one electron flips spin and the resulting moment at the tme is 2.00 @xmath6/fe .    fully explaining the measured non - integer magnetic moments in table iii requires more sophisticated models that account for randomness and the interaction between dopants atoms , perhaps by considering interactions between supercells or using different models , such as clustering in the alloys instead of one tme per supercell .",
    "our numerical results suggest that in order to get a large magnetic moment for a tme doped si dilute alloy , it is best to choose a tme having nearly , but less than , half filled d - states .",
    "we compare the most basic properties of mn and fe doped in si by carrying out first principles calculations based on density functional theory .",
    "alloy models of 8- , 64- and 216-atoms are considered . in each model , two possible dopant sites , the s site and the i site , and two possible dopant species , fe and mn , are investigated .",
    "the relaxation around the dopant at the s site depends on its atomic radius .",
    "a contraction is consistently obtained for fe because its atomic radius is smaller than that of a si atom .",
    "the opposite behavior is determined for doping mn . at an i site ,",
    "the surrounding si atoms move away from either dopant independent of the tme radius because some of the d - states shift their charges toward the open space under the attractive interaction with the si nuclei .",
    "these shifted charges repel the bond charges between the si atoms and expand the bond near the tme .",
    "the effect of the contraction due to relaxations can have a detrimental effect on the value of the magnetic moment - diminishing the magnetic moment / tme .",
    "the resulting small volume can force all the spins of the metal atom s electrons to pair",
    ". a high concentration of either fe or mn can constrict the relaxation through dopant - dopant interactions .",
    "we make a few suggestions for doping tmes in si .    to begin , atoms with close to but less than half filled d - states will be better choices because the valence electron spins can potentially align to yield a large magnetic moment / dopant in the alloy .",
    "secondly , it is better to dope with a tme with a larger atomic radius . as shown in the s site cases , contraction of the lattice around the smaller fe reduces the available volume and restricts the spin alignment , lowering the moment , while the lattice expansion around the larger mn at an s site allows for a greater moment .",
    "third , near an i site the volume expands independent of atomic radius .",
    "the expansion may not , however , be enough to maximize the spin alignment .",
    "fourth , the 8-atom results , most relevant to high doping concentrations , yield unexpected magnetic moments because of coupling between the dopant atoms .",
    "furthermore , the relaxation around tmes can also exhibit unaniticipated behavior .",
    "therefore , if the doping concentration is over 10% , one should take the interaction between the dopants into account .",
    "the first two suggestions are common sense .",
    "we confirm them by carrying out explicit numerical calculations .",
    "we see that the magnetic properties of the isolated tme are modified by the si lattice environment .",
    "the third and fourth point may not be so intuitively obvious , showing that the expansion at the i site and dopant - dopant interaction between cells affect both lattice relaxations and the resultant magnetic moments at high concentrations .",
    "finally , we note that doping tmes at s sites may be possible with low temperature molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "otherwise it is necessary to break bonds for the metal atoms to occupy the s site .",
    "other methods , such as the ion implantation growth scheme , are necessary .",
    "there are recent suggestions that co - doping with pnictides can reduce the s site formation energy and increase the magnetic moment per unit cell .",
