    "x - ray pulsars are binary systems consisting of bright massive star and neutron star . the last one draws a matter from a massive bright star and forms an accretion disk around itself .",
    "the accretion disk emits x - ray radiation within the range of energies from hundreds ev to tens kev .",
    "x - ray pulsar cen x-3 is a pair of blue giant and neutron star at a distance of 8  kpc from the earth .",
    "the mass of the neutron star is 1.2  @xmath3 and mass of the giant is 20  @xmath3 .",
    "this object was discovered in 1967 with the help of sub - orbital rocket .",
    "x - ray pulses with period of 4.84  sec caused by neutron star spin were detected by uhuru satellite @xcite in 1971 .",
    "the binary system was optically identified in @xcite .",
    "the binary has eclipses with orbital period of 2.09  days . out of eclipse phase the iron emission line in the spectrum of cen x-3",
    "is detected at 6.5  kev @xcite .",
    "this source was observed by series of different modern high - energy telescopes : gamma - satellite integral within the range of @xmath4  kev @xcite , ground - based cherenkov telescope mark-6 at energies above 400  gev @xcite and x - ray space observatories chandra and xmm - newton within the range of @xmath5  kev . our goal was to process and analyse xmm - newton data of cen x-3 .",
    "in our investigations we used the data obtained by xmm - newton satellite on january 27 , 2001 during 67  kiloseconds observation .",
    "these data are public available on heasarc ( high energy astrophysics scientific archive resources center ) database web - page ( http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) .",
    "xmm - newton satellite contains three epic cameras ( mos1 , mos2 and pn ) that allows us to build the images , spectra and light curves for x - ray sources . during this observation two cameras ,",
    "pn and mos2 , worked in imaging mode , and mos1 camera worked in the light curve building mode ( timing mode ) . during observations in timing mode time resolution and sensitivity of the camera increase , which is very useful for obtaining spectra and light curves . in this mode",
    "it is possible to build only histogram instead of two - dimensional image . for data processing sas ( science analysis system )",
    "shell ver .",
    "1.52.8 was used .    during this observation",
    ", namely in its end , a solar flare appeared , which led to sharp rise of the light curve during 900 seconds .",
    "this time interval was excluded , and the resulting data contained 66  kiloseconds observation . for this last time interval",
    "we obtained an image using the data from pn camera , which has the greatest sensitivity and time resolution compared to other epic cameras .",
    "another reason for choosing of pn camera is significant pile - up effect in mos2 camera .",
    "this effect lies in the following .",
    "if two separate photons arrive during the time which is less than time resolution , then only one photon is detected by ccd matrix pixel instead of two and its energy is equal to the sum of energies of two photons .",
    "the influence of pile - up effect on spectrum is the following : firstly , continuum level increases at high energies and decreases at low energies ; secondly , a part of photons is lost at all .",
    "in paper @xcite the formula for calculation of cen x-3 eclipses moments was derived taking into account the changes of system orbital period . using this formula we determined the orbital phase of cen x-3 system for the beginning and the end of xmm - newton observation we consider .",
    "these phase values are -0.03 and 0.33 .",
    "phase 0 corresponds to the mid - eclipse and phases @xmath6 correspond to the case when pulsar is in front of the star .",
    "the light curve of the observation for pn camera is presented in fig .  1 .",
    "one can see that x - ray flux significantly increases during post - eclipse phase .    to build the spectrum we select a circle region from the image with radius equal to 48  arcsec ,",
    "thus the circle touches the image border . from the spectrum of this region",
    "the background spectrum was substracted .",
    "the background spectrum was taken from the rest part of the image .",
    "it is worth to note that we select the maximum possible resolution of the instrument , 15  ev , as the energy resolution of the spectrum .",
    "the resulting spectrum was handled by xspec software package ver .",
    "we excluded @xmath7  kev range , because xmm - newton is not sensitive in this energy range , and obtained the spectrum , which is presented in  fig .",
    "this plot was built without taking into account any physical models of radiation .",
    "we fit the continuum level by the powerlaw model taking into account the photoelectric absorption along the line of sight @xcite and the iron absorption limit at 7.2  kev . following @xcite we used frozen values for spectral power - law index @xmath8 and hydrogen column density @xmath9  @xmath10 .",
    "we obtained the values of normalization factor @xmath11@xmath10  s@xmath12kev@xmath12 , absorption limit energy @xmath13  kev and optical depth @xmath14 . in @xmath15  kev range of the spectrum one can see 3 iron emission lines .",
    "the first line of triplet is @xmath1 line , which is emitted by neutral and low - ionised iron atoms .",
    "the second and the third lines are formed by helium - like ion fe xxv and hydrogen - like fe xxvi correspondingly . for more detailed study of these lines we rebuilt the spectrum for @xmath16  kev region .",
    "we fitted emission lines by gaussian and lorentzian profiles and found that the first one is more suitable .",
    "we obtained the central energies , widths and intensities for all lines and uncertainties of these parameters .",
    "the iron emission triplet can be seen in fig .  3 and parameters of lines are presented in table  1 .",
    "in addition to gaussian profile we used `` diskline '' model describing relativistic accretion disk @xcite .",
    "this model allows us to estimate the angle between accretion disk and line of sight and the inner and outer radii of the accretion disk .",
    "we found that the sum of diskline and gaussian profiles is needed to account the finite width of @xmath17 line due to thermal broadening .",
    "we obtained the following inclination angles of the accretion disk : @xmath18 for k@xmath19  line and @xmath20 for fe  xxv and fe  xxvi lines .",
    "the difference of inclination angle for @xmath21  line and other lines is due to the fact , that it is formed in the outer atmosphere of the binary system .",
    "according to our model the accretion disk has inner radius of 4500  km and outer radius ( by fe  xxv and fe  xxvi lines ) of 405000  km .",
    "our results agree within the errors with previous observations @xcite according to which the inclination angle is equal to @xmath22 .",
    "the iron triplet with diskline approximation is presented in fig .",
    "beside xmm - newton cen x-3 was observed by other satellites in particular chandra @xcite and asca @xcite .",
    "these two satellites obtained cen x-3 spectra in which iron lines in @xmath15  kev region were detected .",
    "we compared iron lines parameters from these observations with our results .",
    "chandra observed cen x-3 on december 30 , 2000 during of 48 kilosecoonds at orbital phases of @xmath23 .",
    "chandra group determined the equivalet width of @xmath1 line and compared it with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we compared our @xmath1 line parameters with chandra data during post - eclipse phase which partially corresponds to xmm - newton time of observations .",
    "the central energies of the line are the same for both satellites .",
    "line intensity for xmm - newton data is less than for chandra : @xmath24@xmath10s@xmath12 and @xmath25@xmath10s@xmath12 correspondingly .",
    "this difference lies within the errors and is negligible .",
    "according to @xcite @xmath1 line width is equal to @xmath26  ev , which is 5 times less than for xmm - newton observation .",
    "we fixed @xmath1 line width at 11  ev and obtained increasing of the @xmath27 value from 1.0126 to 1.2463 and corresponding f - statistics @xmath28 .",
    "this means that models with 11  kev and 52  kev are similar with probability of @xmath29 .",
    "thus we concluded that for xmm - newton observation intrinsic line width is significantly larger and this effect can not be explained by the differences in energy resolution of xmm - newton and chandra detectors .",
    "chandra observed cen x-3 when it was in outburst state while the time of xmm - newton observation ( 4 week later ) corresponds to quiescent state of system .",
    "thus the differences in x - ray emission can be explained by the different states of cen x-3 .",
    "the values of continuum level and power - law normalization factor for xmm - newton data is 19 times less that also agrees with quiescent state .",
    "it is clearly seen from the light curve that the source brightness varies significantly with the orbital phase .",
    "we considered the changes of the intensity of iron lines with phase .",
    "this effect was discussed at first time in @xcite .",
    "the authors examined the changes of cen x-3 iron lines using asca x - ray satellite .",
    "this satellite observed cen x-3 during june @xmath30 , 1993 at the following orbital phases : @xmath31 ( pre - eclipse ) , @xmath32 ( ingress ) , @xmath33 ( eclipse ) , @xmath34 ( egress ) .",
    "xmm - newton observation interval corresponds to a part of asca eclipse interval and the whole egress interval .",
    "for these two phase intervals we built the source spectra from xmm - newton observation and found the parameters of iron lines ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we compared parameters of iron lines for xmm - newton and asca in eclipse and egress phases .",
    "taking into account the difference of effective areas of satellites detectors we found that continuum levels within 6.5  kev region are equal .",
    "intensities of all lines from xmm - newton observation coincides with asca data within errors .",
    "we confirmed the orbital variations of iron lines .",
    "positions of the lines also coincide within errors . when comparing the equivalent widths of the lines we revealed the following .",
    "during eclipse phase fe  xxvi line is two times broader for xmm - newton than for asca , but two other lines coincide within errors . during egress phase all lines from xmm - newton observation have 1.5  times larger width than from asca .",
    "these differences depend on the features of cen x-3 accretion state at the time of asca observation ( june @xmath30 , 1993 ) .",
    "therefore the main comparison results are the confirmation of orbital variations , identified by the group of japanese satellite asca @xcite and quantitative conformity of lines parameters , namely positions and intensities .    in @xcite",
    "the discovery of fe  xxv triplet instead of single line was reported .",
    "the components of triplet were interpreted as forbidden transition , intercombination and resonance lines . in xmm - newton spectrum",
    "we can see only single fe  xxv line with the parameters given in table  1 .",
    "this gives us an evidence that fe  xxv triplet could be resolved only at high state of binary system .",
    "also we found fe  xxvi line at 6.9  kev , which was observed by asca group but is absent in object spectrum from chandra .",
    "we found that lines parameters , namely their orbital variations , position and intensity , obtained from asca and xmm - newton observations coincide . in @xcite the authors explained the lack of fe  xxvi line by the stellar wind decreasing .",
    "taking into account high state of cen x-3 during chandra observation we conclude that stellar wind rate is not the crucial factor that affects x - ray luminosity of the system .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
