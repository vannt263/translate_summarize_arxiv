    "beyond the orbit of neptune there exists a population of bodies remnant from the formation of the solar system , planetesimals whose number density inhibited further accretion and whose orbits are , in general , stable on solar system time scales .",
    "these are the so - called trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) , also known as edgeworth - kuiper objects ( ekos ) or kuiper - belt objects ( kbos ) .",
    "postulated by @xcite and @xcite , their existence has only recently been confirmed observationally by @xcite .",
    "the edgeworth - kuiper belt ( ekb ) is also most probably the source of the short - period comets @xcite and a transient population of objects between the orbits of jupiter and neptune : the centaurs .",
    "although there are no strict definitions , the tnos are generally classified in three groups : resonant objects , classical objects and scattered objects .",
    "the resonant are objects trapped in orbital resonances with neptune , mainly in the 2:3 like pluto , and are therefore also called plutinos .",
    "the classical objects have semi - major axes mostly confined between 40 and 48 au .",
    "scattered objects have highly eccentric and inclined orbits .",
    "presently , about 590 tnos and 33 centaurs are known .",
    "the physical properties of the tnos and centaurs are still poorly understood .",
    "spectroscopic studies of these objects are only possible with 8 - 10 meter class telescopes and limited to the brightest ones . therefore , broadband photometry is still the most feasible method allowing a compositional survey relevant for statistical work . at present ,",
    "several adequate samplings of the visible colors of these objects are published , allowing already some statistical analysis ( e.g. : * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , this data is not yet enough to support or refute some claimed relations between colors , sizes and orbital parameters . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite showed the importance of the @xmath4 color in any taxonomical work characterizing the tnos , but with @xmath9 objects measured so far ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ir data is still scarce .",
    "precise and unequivocal determination of tnos rotational periods is difficult to accomplish .",
    "@xcite detected for the first time lightcurve variability among this class of objects , estimating rotational periods for @xmath10 qy@xmath11 , @xmath12 vk@xmath13 and @xmath12 tb .",
    "presently , three more tnos have published periods with good accuracy : varuna @xcite , @xmath14 to@xmath15 @xcite and @xmath2 sm@xmath3 @xcite",
    ". this latter object has recently been found to be a binary @xcite .",
    "centaurs , which are brighter and easier to study , are better sampled , with rotational periods published for chiron @xcite , asbolus @xcite , pholus @xcite , @xmath0 ug@xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 qc@xmath18 and @xmath19 pt@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "knowledge of rotation rates of tnos and centaurs may provide insight into their collisional evolution .",
    "indeed , the present wide color diversity among tnos may have originated from collisional resurfacing processes . moreover ,",
    "albedo measurements , spectroscopic studies , and accurate multicolor photometry on these objects depend critically on the knowledge of their rotational properties ( or magnitude variations ) .",
    "this is necessary due to the non - simultaneity of the observations in the several bands and the long exposure time needed , particularly in the infrared .",
    "large samples are usually necessary for precise determination of the rotational periods .",
    "such samples are hard to obtain due to the faintness and small magnitude variations expected in the vast majority of the tnos .",
    "the identification of short term magnitude variations is , consequently , of most importance , as it allows us to filter candidates for rotational period detections .",
    "we here report on observations of two tnos .",
    "our results consist of a possible determination of a rotational period for @xmath2 sn@xmath3 and a measurement of the @xmath4 color for @xmath0 tc@xmath1 . within our observational errors",
    "we can exclude a rotational period inferior to 8 hours for @xmath0 tc@xmath1 .",
    "these two objects are of increasing interest , since @xmath0 tc@xmath1 has recently been reported to possess a companion object @xcite and it has been suggested that @xmath2 sn@xmath3 belongs to a new dynamical sub - class of tnos @xcite .",
    "this study is based on two observational campaigns : one dedicated to j - band photometry and the other to lightcurve analysis .",
    "j - band photometric data was obtained on the 9th of august 2000 , with the arnica near - infrared camera on the 3.58 m italian national telescope ( tng ; la palma , spain ) equipped with a hgtecd array detector with @xmath21 pixels ( pixel scale=1  , pixel size=40 @xmath22 ) .",
    "v - band relative photometric data was obtained on the 30th of september 2000 , at the 3.6 m new technology telescope ( ntt ; eso , la silla , chile ) with the susi2 ccd camera on the f/11 nasmith focus , equipped with a mosaic of two eev ccds with @xmath23 pixels each ( pixel scale=0.16  , pixel size=15 @xmath22 ) .",
    "this night was non - photometric  seeing varied from 1.3  to 2.6  .",
    "the sufficiently small angular motion of the targets allowed for sidereal tracking rate in all runs ( see table [ tab : obs_circums ] ) .",
    "v - band lightcurve data was reduced with iraf s ccdred package . for @xmath0 tc@xmath1 , we used an aperture radius of 4.5  centered around the object ( and reference stars ) with the sky level estimated by using the mode value within a concentric ring between 11.2  and 12.8  ( farther than 4.3 times the worst seeing ) .",
    "relative magnitude was computed relative to a `` superstar '' made with the 3 brightest field stars , whose stability was verified . to check for the significance of eventual magnitude variations on the target , two stars of about the same magnitude as the object",
    "were also measured . for @xmath2 sn@xmath3 ,",
    "an aperture of 3.8  was used .",
    "this object was fainter than the previous and more sensitive to sky variations , therefore a smaller aperture was used in order to improve the s / n ratio .",
    "sky was estimated on a ring between 8.0  and 9.6  in most of the images due to the presence of a close star in some of the frames . however , for images with seeings above 2.0  , the sky ring was moved away to 11.2  to ensure that the sky was being estimated at distances were no ( significant ) signal from the object was expected .",
    "magnitude was computed relative to a `` superstar '' made with the 2 brightest field stars that were also checked for stability .",
    "a star with magnitude close to the object s was taken as a reference for fluctuations .",
    "relative magnitudes obtained are presented in table [ tab : tc36_sn165 ] .",
    "note that we may expect some flux loss in a few bad seeing images with the fixed apertures used .",
    "however , since we performed relative photometry , this effect will not change the measured relative magnitude if the reference stars have the same fwhm as the object .",
    "we check for all cases and discard any images presenting seeing variations above 0.3  .",
    "near - infrared j - band data was reduced using both iraf and midas following the standard techniques of flatfielding , using twilight flats , estimation of a sky frame , subtraction of the sky from all frames , after proper scaling , determination of the offsets between frames based on the image headers and final image registration .",
    "details on the reduction procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 color of @xmath0 tc@xmath1 was calculated using the v magnitude reported by @xcite , which was obtained with only 22 minutes of time difference with our j - band data ( see table [ tab : colors ] ) . to compare the spectral behaviors , we quote also the @xmath24 colors for @xmath0 tc@xmath1 and @xmath2 sn@xmath3 @xcite , and @xmath4 color for @xmath2 sn@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "relative spectral reflectances at the central wavelengths of the broadband filters , normalized to the v filter , are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "analysis of figure 1 shows that @xmath0 tc@xmath1 possess a red spectrum at all studied wavelengths , indicating that its surface may be covered by some organic material @xcite , while @xmath2 sn@xmath3 presents an almost flat spectrum at all wavelengths .",
    "this illustrates the wide color diversity seen among the tnos population , with colors varying from gray ( @xmath2 sn@xmath3 ) to red ( @xmath0 tc@xmath1 ) .",

    "in figure [ fig : sn165 ] we plotted the lightcurve for @xmath2 sn@xmath3 resulting from the data in table [ tab : tc36_sn165 ] . we have also plotted the data for a reference star of about the same magnitude as the object , used to check for the significance of any eventual variability .",
    "it seems patent that the object has a periodic variation of magnitude .",
    "a first test for non - random variation was performed with the chi - square test , in which the _ null hypothesis _ is : _ there is no non - random variation _ @xcite .",
    "the weighted mean magnitude is calculated for the object ( @xmath51 ) and then the chi - square : @xmath52    were @xmath53 are the relative magnitude values , @xmath54 the corresponding errors and @xmath55 the number of data - points .",
    "assuming that the errors are gaussian , and that @xmath55 is a large number , the mean limiting distribution is @xmath56 and the variance is @xmath57 . for @xmath2 sn@xmath3 and using a 26 data - point sample , we obtained @xmath58 , which is @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) above the mean @xmath61 . since the result is larger than @xmath62 , we have a significant rejection of the null hypothesis .",
    "to search for any periodic signal concealed in the data , we applied the lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite .",
    "a high peak is detected at the frequency @xmath63 with a power of @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lomb_sn165 ] ) .    to check for the level of significance in the estimated period",
    ", we carried out a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "holding fixed the number of data - points , their time locations @xmath65 and the corresponding errors @xmath54 , 10000 random data - sets were constructed .",
    "each random @xmath66 was generated following a gaussian distribution of standard deviation @xmath54 . applying the lomb - scargle periodogram to each one of these random data - sets",
    ", we may estimate the probability of our detected frequency being due to noise  the _ false period probability _ ( @xmath67 ) . with only 4 events with higher powers than @xmath64 we have a @xmath68 , that is , a _ significance level _ of @xmath69 .    by fitting a sine - wave of @xmath63 to the data with the levenberg - marquardt algorithm",
    ", we determine the magnitude variation , _",
    "i.e. _ , peak to peak amplitude , of @xmath70 . after subtracting this signal sine - wave to the data , we obtained a noise sample with standard deviation @xmath71 , which is of the order of our average error bars .",
    "this revealed a good signal subtraction .",
    "to determine the error in the frequency , we also performed a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "analogously to the previous simulation , we generated 1000 data - sets , now adding the gaussian noise to the signal obtained from the fitted sine wave and applying the lomb - periodogram to each set .",
    "the resulting distribution had a mean value of @xmath72 and a standard deviation of @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , our detected frequency is : @xmath74    the error in the amplitude is estimated by taking the two extreme values ( amplitude plus or minus its error from the fit ) , resulting from fitting the sine - wave with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we get a lightcurve amplitude of : @xmath77    however , we should be cautious in considering the significance of the detected frequency , since the lightcurve is not sufficiently sampled to allow detection of eventually more complex behaviors than a single sine - wave variation .",
    "nevertheless , we may still make considerations on its rotational period and possible asymmetry .",
    "assuming an uniform surface albedo for the object , the lightcurve is the result of the variation of the projected cross - section area of an elongated shape in rotation .",
    "therefore , a full rotation produces a lightcurve with two minima and two maxima . with this assumption ,",
    "the period found with our observations is only due to half rotation .",
    "hence , the estimated rotation period is : @xmath78    supposing a tri - axial ellipsoidal body ( with @xmath79 ) rotating along the shortest axis ( @xmath80 ) perpendicular to the line of sight , from the determined amplitude of the lightcurve @xmath81 we estimate a minimum value for the ratio between the semi - axis @xmath82 and @xmath83 , from the equation @xmath84 : @xmath85    however , the hypothesis of a rotating non - uniform albedo object producing a mono - peak lightcurve can not be ruled out , in which case the rotational period would be half of the computed value above .    in order to check for the real variability of the object s magnitude",
    ", we performed also the chi - square test on a reference star .",
    "a @xmath86 was found , which is only @xmath87 above the @xmath88 , well within the @xmath62 bounds of the null hypothesis .",
    "the results assure the stability of the relative photometry and thus confirm that the object s variability is real . also , the lomb - scargel periodogram applied to the reference star did not reveal any significant periodic signal .",
    "we observed @xmath0 tc@xmath1 over 8.362 hours and no apparent periodic variation seems present within this time span ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tc36 ] ) .    with a sample of 30 data - points ,",
    "we expect a @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    ". the chi - square test on the object , resulted in a @xmath91 , which is @xmath92 above the @xmath88 .",
    "this would imply a rejection of the null hypothesis .",
    "however , if we reject the 2 lowest points that seem slightly wayward , we obtain a @xmath93 , now only @xmath94 above @xmath88 and within the null hypothesis interval .",
    "once more , we performed the same test on a close magnitude field star ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tc36 ] ) , obtaining a @xmath95 , only @xmath96 above @xmath88 .",
    "this again assures the stability of the relative photometry .",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram does not find any significant period in the data , neither in the object nor in the reference star .",
    "comparing the data samples of the object and the reference star , we see a slight systematic magnitude decrease for the object ( @xmath97 ) , that might indicate this object as a good candidate for a longer rotational period .",
    "however , this result should be taken with caution since the scatter of data at the end of the night increases due to the degradation of seeing conditions .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that the objects does not possess a detectable periodic variation below @xmath98 within the observed errors .",
    "a periodic signal of frequency @xmath99 ( periodicity @xmath100 ) with a confidence level above @xmath101 is present on our v - band lightcurve of @xmath2 sn@xmath3 with a peak - to - peak magnitude variation of @xmath102 .",
    "a possible rotational period of @xmath6 and asymmetry ratio of @xmath103 are estimated .",
    "this rotational period is to be taken with caution and should be confirmed with better sampled observations . for @xmath0 tc@xmath1 , we do not detect any periodic variation over our @xmath98 time - span within the uncertainties . if @xmath0 tc@xmath1 has a detectable rotational period it warrants longer observations . from the relative reflectance spectra obtained with the bvrij colors , of @xmath0",
    "tc@xmath1 we see that it possesses a red spectrum , probably resulting from a cover of organic material on its surface .",
