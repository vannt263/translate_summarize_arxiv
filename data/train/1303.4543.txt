    "antonov in 1962 @xcite discovered an instability that later became known as antonov s instability or gravothermal catastrophe @xcite .",
    "it signified the beginning of the study of thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems @xcite and the nowadays rapidly developing field of statistical mechanics with long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "+ in the original formulation of antonov s instability @xcite , the system consists of particles ( stars ) bound by a spherical shell with insulating and perfectly reflecting walls .",
    "the particles interact only with newtonian gravity ( no cosmological constant or any relativistic effects are present ) and the number of particles and the energy of the system are constant , i.e. the system is studied in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "it was found that the entropy of the system has no global maximum and that for @xmath0 no equilibrium states exist",
    ". for @xmath1 there exist local entropy maxima , i.e. metastable states , only for density contrast below the critical value @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the central and edge densities , respectively . + in gravity",
    "the ensembles are not equivalent . in the microcanonical ensemble , stable equilibria with negative specific heat",
    "this negative specific heat region is replaced by a phase transition in the canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "the antonov system in the canonical ensemble ( with no cosmological constant ) , is studied in detail by chavanis @xcite .",
    "he found that the free energy does not have a global minimum and equilibria exist only for temperatures greater than the critical dimensionless temperature @xmath5 which corresponds to dimensionless inverse temperature @xmath6 .",
    "these equilibria are stable only for density contrast less than the critical value @xmath7 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , as well ) .",
    "+ we studied the gravothermal instability with a cosmological constant @xmath8 in the microcanonical ensemble in ref .",
    "it was found that for a fixed energy , the maximum radius ( which equals @xmath9 with no @xmath8 ) is increasing with increasing @xmath8 , while for @xmath10 there appears a second critical radius which is decreasing and the two radii merge at some marginal @xmath8 .",
    "this was identified as a reentrant behaviour ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details on reentrant phase transitions in statistical systems with long - range interactions ) . in the present work ,",
    "the system is placed in a heat bath and the walls are non - insulating , i.e. we study the canonical ensemble .",
    "in contrast to the microcanonical one , we find that the critical radius @xmath11 , for a fixed temperature and mass , is decreasing with increasing cosmological constant .",
    "in addition the instability occurs for @xmath12 in the canonical ensemble , in contrast to the microcanonical one .",
    "this is evident in case @xmath13 , since then there exist no equilibria if @xmath14 for a fixed temperature and mass .",
    "a reentrant phase transition appears in the canonical ensemble , when one examines the system with respect to the temperature for a fixed radius .",
    "there appear two critical temperatures for @xmath10 . for the intermediate temperature values , no thermodynamic equilibria are possible .",
    "in the newtonian limit , the poisson equation is modified @xcite in the presence of a cosmological constant @xmath8 as : @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the gravitational potential can be decomposed to two parts @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the newtonian and @xmath19 the cosmological potential , that are given by @xmath20 for convenience we call the newtonian limit of de sitter ( @xmath21 ) and anti - de sitter ( @xmath22 ) spaces @xcite just ds and ads , respectively . + we consider a self - gravitating gas of @xmath23 particles with unity mass inside a spherical non - insulating shell inside a heat bath and restrict only to spherical symmetric configurations .",
    "we work in the mean field approximation , for which the @xmath23-body distribution function is replaced by the one body distribution function @xmath24 .",
    "the boltzmann entropy is defined as @xmath25 .",
    "the helmholtz free energy is equal to @xmath26 .",
    "equivalently one can work with the massieu function @xcite @xmath27 that gives @xmath28 the maximization of @xmath29 with constant @xmath30 and the maximization of @xmath31 with constant @xmath32 ( and constant @xmath33 in both cases ) , with respect to perturbations @xmath34 , are the same @xcite to first order in @xmath34 , i.e. give the same equilibria , described by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution function @xmath35 where @xmath36 this is proved in @xcite without a cosmological constant , and holds in the presence of @xmath8 as well , with the difference being that @xmath37 does not satisfy poisson equation now , but equation ( [ eq : poisl ] ) .",
    "the two ensembles have the same equilibria . however , the second variations of @xmath29 and @xmath31 are different .",
    "therefore , what is different in the two ensembles is the turning point at which an instability sets in .",
    "this causes a great qualitative difference for the two ensembles .",
    "+ introducing the dimensionless variables @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and using equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) , equation ( [ eq : poisl ] ) becomes @xmath41 called the emden-@xmath8 equation .",
    "let us call @xmath42 the value of @xmath43 at @xmath44 . in order to generate the series of equilibria needed to study the stability of the system , the emden-@xmath8 equation has to be solved with initial conditions @xmath45 , keeping @xmath33 constant and for various values of the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath3 .",
    "this is a rather complicated problem , since , unlike @xmath13 case , while solving for various @xmath48 , mass is not automatically preserved , because of the mass scale @xmath49 that @xmath8 introduces .",
    "a suitable @xmath50 value has to be chosen at each @xmath48 .",
    "we define the dimensionless mass @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mean density of matter .",
    "calling @xmath42 the value of @xmath43 at @xmath44 , equation ( [ eq : mdef ] ) can also be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the dimensionless inverse temperature .",
    "it can be calculated by integrating the emden-@xmath8 equation , to get : @xmath55 we developed an algorithm to solve equation ( [ eq : emdenl ] ) for various values of @xmath50 , @xmath48 keeping @xmath56 fixed . from equation ( [ eq : mdef ] ) it is clear that solving for various fixed @xmath56 can be interpreted as solving for various @xmath46 and/or @xmath44 for a fixed @xmath33 .",
    "+ we find that in ds case there exist multiple series of equilibria for a given cosmological constant , while in ads case there is just one series likewise @xmath13 case .",
    "studying the series @xmath57 for both ads and ds , we determined the critical values of radii and temperature beyond which there are no equilibria .",
    "these critical values are plotted in figures [ fig : rcr ] and [ fig : tcr ] , with respect to @xmath46 , where the unshaded region is the region of instability in both figures .",
    "+ in figure [ fig : rcr ] the radius denoted @xmath58 is the minimum radius for which thermodynamic equilibria exist in the canonical ensemble .",
    "@xmath59 is the radius of the homogeneous solution which exists only in ds and is defined by equation @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 . in the shaded region of figure [ fig : rcr ] there",
    "can always be found metastable states . for ads case ( @xmath22 )",
    ", these have always monotonically decreasing density ( @xmath62 ) and suffer a transition to unstable equilibria at a critical density contrast @xmath63 whose value depends on @xmath46 .",
    "for ds case and for @xmath64 , the metastable states suffer a transition to unstable equilibria likewise ads , but the density is not necessarily monotonic , neither does @xmath62 always hold .",
    "for each @xmath46 there exists a tower of solutions with qualitative ( and quantitative of course ) different density functions . in the region @xmath65 ,",
    "all metastable states have @xmath66 .",
    "the ones , whose density is a monotonic function of @xmath44 do not suffer any transition to unstable equilibria , while all others series have a turning point .",
    "+ in figure [ fig : tcr ] we see that in ads the critical temperature is decreasing for increasing cosmological constant , while in ds there appears a reentrant phase transition . for small positive values of @xmath46 ,",
    "compared to the mean density @xmath52 , the system can not stabilize for low temperatures .",
    "it needs higher temperature values to obtain a significant pressure gradient to balance gravity . as @xmath46 is increasing , the cosmological repelling force increases , enforcing the total outward pushing force and hence , enabling the system to stabilize at lower temperatures .",
    "point @xmath67 , denotes the marginal value @xmath68 for which a dynamically static equilibrium is allowed .",
    "this limiting configuration corresponds to a singular solution at which all mass is concentrated at the edge .",
    "it can easily be calculated : @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 . for @xmath74 ,",
    "solutions with @xmath75 ( static dynamical equilibria ) do exist and as @xmath46 increases the mass is allowed to be closer to the center .",
    "all thermodynamic equilibria below the lower critical branch ( low temperatures ) have increasing density ( @xmath66 ) . for fixed @xmath44 , @xmath33 and a fixed @xmath46 with @xmath76 ,",
    "as we increase the temperature beginning from zero , we pass from a region of metastable states with @xmath66 to a region of no equilibria , at a first critical temperature @xmath77 .",
