    "relativistic a+a collisions are an important source of experimental information about the qcd phase diagram and the strongly interacting matter properties . the last stage of such collisions is traditionally analyzed within the statistical approach which gives us an excellent opportunity to reveal the parameters of chemical freeze - out .",
    "this approach is based on the assumption of the thermal equilibrium existence during the last stage of reaction .",
    "such an equilibrium can be reached due to intensive particle scattering .",
    "the stage of the system evolution when the inelastic reactions between hadrons stop is referred to as a chemical freeze - out ( fo ) .",
    "particle yields are determined by the parameters of fo , namely by chemical potentials and temperature .",
    "this general picture is a basis of the hadron resonance gas model ( hrgm ) @xcite which is the most successful one in describing the hadronic yields measured in heavy - ion experiments for energies from ags to lhc . despite a significant success of the hrgm in the experimental data analysis",
    "there are a few unresolved problems . in general",
    "they are related to the description of hadron yields which contain ( anti)strange quarks .",
    "especially the energy dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ratios was out of high quality description .",
    "excess of strange hadrons yields within the hrgm led physical community to ponder over strangeness suppression .",
    "the first receipt to resolve this problem was to introduce the strangeness suppression factor @xmath0 which should be fitted in order to describe the experimental data @xcite .",
    "however , such an approach is not supported by any underlying physical model and the physical meaning of @xmath0 remains unclear @xcite .",
    "in addition the strangeness suppression approach in its original form does not contain a hard - core repulsion between hadrons , while the latter is an important feature of the hrgm .",
    "a significant role of the hard - core repulsion was demonstrated once more in refs . @xcite where the global fit of hadron yield ratios was essentially improved ( to @xmath1 1.2 ) compared to all previous analyses .",
    "the most advanced way to account for the hard - core repulsion between hadrons is to consider a hadron gas as a multi - component mixture of particles with different radii @xcite . within this approach all baryons and mesons except for the kaons and the pions",
    "are endowed by the common hard - core radii @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . at the same time",
    "the kaon and the pion radii @xmath9 and @xmath10 are fitted independently in order to provide the best description of @xmath5 ratio @xcite .",
    "this is an important finding since the non - monotonic energy dependence of @xmath5 ratio may indicate some qualitative changes of the system properties and may serve as a signal of the deconfinement onset .",
    "this is a reason why this ratio known as the strangeness horn is of a special interest .",
    "note , that the multi - component approach substantially increased the strangeness horn description quality , without spoiling the other ratios including @xmath6 one .",
    "however , even this advanced approach does not reproduce the topmost point of the strangeness horn indicating that the data description is still not ideal . in order to resolve this problem in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 factor was considered as a free parameter within the hrgm with multi - component repulsion .",
    "although the @xmath0 data fit improves the strangeness horn description quality sizably , it does not seem to be useful for the description of other hadron multiplicities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the claims established on the low - quality fit @xcite , at low energies it was found @xcite that within the error bars in heavy ion collisions there is an enhancement of strangeness and not a suppression .",
    "however , the effect of apparent strangeness non - equilibration can be more successfully explained by the hypothesis of separate chemical fo for all strange hadrons .",
    "since all the hadrons made of @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks are under thermal equilibration whereas the hadrons containing @xmath13 quark are not , then it is reasonable to assume two different fos for these two kinds of particles . following this conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite a separate strangeness fo ( sfo ) was introduced .",
    "note , that according to @xcite both fo and sfo parameters are connected by the conservation laws of entropy , baryonic charge and isospin projection , while the net strangeness is explicitly set to zero at fo and at sfo .",
    "these conservation laws are crucial elements of the concept of separate sfo developed in @xcite which allows one to essentially reduce the number of independent fitting parameters .",
    "another principal element that differs the hrgm of @xcite from the ideal gas treatment used in @xcite is the presence of multi - component hard - core repulsion .    using the hrgm of @xcite it was possible to successfully describe all hadron multiplicities measured in a+a collisions at ags , sps and rhic energies with @xmath1 1.06 .",
    "the concept of separate sfo led to a systematic improvement of all experimental data description .",
    "however , the topmost point of the strangeness horn again was not fitted even within the experimental error .",
    "note , however , that the general description of @xmath14 ratio energy dependence was rather good except for the upper point .",
    "since an introduction of the @xmath15 factor demonstrated a remarkable description of all points of the strangeness horn , whereas the separate sfo led to a systematic improvement of all hadron yields description , we decided to combine these elements in order to describe an experimental data with the highest possible quality .",
    "this ambitious task is the main aim of the present paper .",
    "in addition , the problem of residual strangeness non - equilibration should also be clarified due to its importance from the academic point of view .",
    "evidently , the best tool for such a purpose is the most successful version of the hrgm , i.e. the hrgm with the multi - component hadronic repulsion and sfo . as it will be shown below , such an approach makes it possible to describe 111 hadron yield ratios measured for 14 values of the center of mass collision energy @xmath16 in the interval from 2.7 gev to 200 gev with the highest quality ever achieved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic features of the developed model are outlined in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present and discuss the new fit of hadronic multiplicity ratios with two chemical freeze - outs and @xmath0 factor , while section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "in what follows we treat a hadronic system as a multi - component boltzmann gas of hard spheres . the effects of quantum statistics are negligible for typical temperatures of the hadronic gas whereas the hard - core repulsion between the particles significantly affects a corresponding equation of state @xcite .",
    "the present model is dealing with the grand canonical treatment .",
    "hence a thermodynamical state of system under consideration is fixed by the volume @xmath17 , the temperature @xmath18 , the baryonic chemical potential @xmath19 , the strange chemical potential @xmath20 and the chemical potential of the isospin third component @xmath21 .",
    "these parameters control the pressure @xmath22 of the system .",
    "in addition they define the densities @xmath23 of corresponding charges @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . introducing the symmetric matrix of the second virial coefficients @xmath26 with the elements @xmath27",
    ", we can obtain the parametric equation of state of the present model in a compact form @xmath28 the equation of state is written in terms of the solutions @xmath29 of the following system @xmath30^{-1 } } \\biggr ] \\",
    ", , \\quad \\quad \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-4mm}\\phi_i ( t )   = \\frac{g_i}{(2\\pi)^3}\\int \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{k^2+m_i^2}}{t } \\right)d^3k   \\ , .",
    "% \\label{eqiv } % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth to note , that quantities @xmath31 have a meaning of @xmath32 sort of hadrons partial pressure .",
    "each @xmath32 sort is characterized by its full chemical potential @xmath33 , mass @xmath34 and degeneracy @xmath35 .",
    "function @xmath36 denotes the corresponding particle thermal density in case of ideal gas . finally , the superscript @xmath18 here is the symbolic notation for operation of a column transposition which yields a row of quantities @xmath29 .",
    "the obtained model parameters for two freeze - outs and their dependence on the collision energy are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : saguni]-[fig : saguniii ] .    in order to account for the possible strangeness non - equilibration",
    "we introduce the @xmath15 factor in a conventional way by replacing @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eqii ] ) as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a number of strange valence quarks plus number of strange valence anti - quarks .",
    "the principal difference of the present model from the traditional approaches is that we employ an independent chemical fo of strange particles .",
    "let us consider this in some detail .",
    "the independent freeze - out of strangeness means that inelastic reactions ( except for the decays ) with hadrons made of s quarks are switched off at the temperature @xmath40 , the baryonic chemical potential @xmath41 , the strange chemical potential @xmath42 , the isospin third projection chemical potential @xmath43 and the three - dimensional emission volume @xmath44 . in general case",
    "these parameters of sfo do not coincide with the temperature @xmath40 , the chemical potentials @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the volume @xmath44 which characterize the freeze - out of non - strange hadrons .",
    "the particle yields are given by the charge density @xmath45 in ( 1 ) and the corresponding volume at fo and at sfo .",
    "at the first glance a model with independent sfo contains four extra fitting parameters for each energy value compared to the traditional approach ( temperature , three chemical potentials and the volume at sfo instead of strangeness suppression / enhancement factor @xmath15 ) .",
    "however , this is not the case due to the conservation laws . indeed , since the entropy , the baryonic charge and the isospin third projection are conserved , then the parameters of fo and sfo are connected by the following equations @xmath46 the effective volumes can be excluded , if these equations are rewritten as @xmath47 thus , the baryonic @xmath41 and the isospin third projection @xmath43 chemical potentials at sfo are now defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fo_sfo1 ] ) .",
    "note , that the strange chemical potentials @xmath48 and @xmath42 are found from the condition of vanishing net strangeness at fo and sfo , respectively .",
    "therefore , the concept of independent sfo leads to an appearance of one independently fitting parameter @xmath40 .",
    "hence , the independent fitting parameters are the following : the baryonic chemical potential @xmath19 , the chemical potential of the third projection of isospin @xmath21 , the chemical freeze - out temperature for strange hadrons @xmath40 , the chemical freeze - out temperature for all non - strange hadrons @xmath49 and the @xmath15 factor .",
    "an inclusion of the width @xmath50 of hadronic states is an important element of the present model .",
    "it is due to the fact that the thermodynamical properties of the hadronic system are sensitive to the width @xcite . in order to account for the finite width of resonances we perform the usual modification of the thermal particle density @xmath37 .",
    "namely , we convolute the boltzmann exponent under the integral over momentum with the normalized breit - wigner mass distribution . as a result , the modified thermal particle density of @xmath32 sort hadron acquires the form @xmath51 here @xmath34 denotes the mean mass of hadron and @xmath52 stands for the threshold in the dominant decay channel .",
    "the main advantages of this approximation is a simplicity of its realization and a clear way to account for the finite width of hadrons .",
    "the observed hadronic multiplicities contain the thermal and decay contributions .",
    "for example , a large part of pions is produced by the decays of heavier hadrons .",
    "therefore , the total multiplicity is obtained as a sum of thermal and decay multiplicities , exactly as it is done in a conventional model . however , writing the formula for final particle densities , we have to take into account that volumes of fo and sfo can be different : @xmath53 here the first term on the right hand side is due to decays after fo whereas the second one accounts for the strange resonances decayed after sfo .",
    "the factor @xmath54 can be replaced by @xmath55 due to baryonic charge conservation .",
    "@xmath56 denotes the branching ratio of the y - th hadron decay into the x - th hadron , with the definition @xmath57 = 1 used for the sake of convenience .",
    "the input parameters of the present model ( masses @xmath34 , widths @xmath50 , degeneracies @xmath35 and branching ratios of all strong decays ) were taken from the particle tables of the thermodynamical code thermus @xcite .",
    "* data sets and fit procedure*. the present model is applied to fit the data .",
    "we take the ratios of particle multiplicities at midrapidity as the data points .",
    "in contrast to fitting multiplicities themselves such an approach allows us to cancel the possible experimental biases . in this paper",
    "we use the data set almost identical to ref . @xcite . at the ags energies ( @xmath58 agev or @xmath59 agev ) the data are available with a good energy resolution above 2 agev . however , for the beam energies 2 , 4 , 6 and 8 agev only a few data points are available .",
    "they corresponds to the yields for pions @xcite , for protons @xcite , for kaons @xcite ( expect for 2 agev ) .",
    "the integrated over @xmath60 data are also available for @xmath61 hyperons @xcite and for @xmath62 hyperons ( for 6 agev only ) @xcite . however , as was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the data for @xmath61 and @xmath62 should be recalculated for midrapidity .",
    "therefore , instead of raw experimental data we used the corrected values from @xcite . next comes the data set at the highest ags energy ( @xmath63 agev or @xmath64 agev ) .",
    "similarly to @xcite , here we analyzed only the na49 mid - rapidity data @xcite .",
    "since the rhic high energy data of different collaborations agree with each other , we analyzed the star results for @xmath65 gev @xcite , @xmath66 gev @xcite , @xmath67 gev @xcite and 200 gev @xcite .",
    "the criterion to define the fitting parameters of the present model is a minimization of @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are , respectively , the theoretical and the experimental values of particle yields ratios , @xmath71 stands for the corresponding experimental error and a summation is performed over all available experimental points .",
    "* combined fit with sfo and @xmath0 factor*. recently performed comprehensive data analysis @xcite for two alternative approaches , i.e the first one with @xmath0 as a free parameter and the second one with separate fo and sfo , showed the advantages and disadvantages of both methods .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 fit provides one with an opportunity to noticeably improve the strangeness horn description with @xmath72 , comparably to the previous result @xmath73 @xcite , but there are only slight improvements of the ratios with strange baryons ( global @xmath74 ) .",
    "the obtained results for the sfo approach demonstrate a nice fit quality for the most problematic ratios for the hrgm , especially for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "although the overall @xmath79 is notably better than with the @xmath0 factor @xcite , but the highest point fitting of the horn got worse .",
    "these results led us to an idea to investigate the combination of these two approaches in order to get the high - quality strangeness horn description without spoiling the quality of other particle ratios .    for 14 values of collision energy",
    "@xmath80 2.7 , 3.3 , 3.8 , 4.3 , 4.9 , 6.3 , 7.6 , 8.8 , 9.2 , 12 , 17 , 62.4 , 130 , 200 gev the best description with two separate freeze - outs and the @xmath15 fit gives @xmath81 = 42.96/41 @xmath82 1.05 , which is only a very slight improvement compared to the previously obtained results @xmath81 = 58.5/55@xmath82 1.06 found for two freeze - outs ( strange and all other particles ) , which are connected by the conservation laws .",
    "note , however , that the value of @xmath83 itself , not divided by number of degrees of freedom , has improved notably , although the deviation of the @xmath15 factor from 1 does not exceed 27 % ( see fig . [",
    "fig : saguniii ] ) .",
    "these findings motivate us to study what ratios and at what energies are improved .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , at each collision energy there are five independent fitting parameters in the considered model with the simultaneous sfo and the @xmath0 fit , while for some collision energies the number of experimental ratios is lower or equal to the number of parameters .",
    "for example , for the energies @xmath16 = 2.7 , 3.3 , 3.8 , 4.3 , 9.2 , 62.4 gev the number of available ratios is small ( 4 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 5 , respectively ) from which only kaons and @xmath61 contain strange quarks .",
    "therefore , for these energies we obtained a perfect data description since we had to solve the above equations . as a result for these energies",
    "the relative deviation of the fit is almost a zero , but it gives us somewhat larger uncertainties for the fitting parameters .",
    "for the energies @xmath80 17 , 130 gev we observed that the resulting fit quality became better compared to the work @xcite .",
    "the most significant improvements correspond to the collision energies @xmath80 6.3 , 7.6 , and 12 gev , that are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sagunv ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : sagunv ] demonstrates very nice fit quality , especially for such traditionally problematic ratios as @xmath14 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for @xmath80 7.6",
    "gev the seven ratios out of ten are improved .",
    "a special attention in our consideration was paid to the strangeness horn , i.e. to @xmath14 ratio .",
    "another reason for a through study of the strangeness horn is a traditional problem of the hrgm to fit it .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : saguniv ] , the remarkable @xmath14 fit improvement for @xmath80 2.7 , 3.3 , 4.3 , 4.9 , 6.3 , 7.6 , 12 gev justifies the usage of the present model .",
    "quantitatively , we found that @xmath81 improvement due to sfo+@xmath15 introduction is @xmath81=1.5/14 , i.e. even better than it was done in @xcite with @xmath81=3.3/14 for the @xmath15 fitting approach and @xmath81=6.3/14 for sfo and @xmath87 .",
    "in addition , in fig . [",
    "fig : sagunvi ] we give the @xmath88 and @xmath89 ratios to show that two separate freeze - outs inclusion with the @xmath15 fit still does not improve these ratios .",
    "the @xmath88 fit quality , for instance , is ( @xmath81=10/8 ) .",
    "hence , up to now the best fit of the @xmath88 ratio was obtained within the sfo approach with @xmath87 . as it was mentioned in @xcite",
    "a too slow decrease of model results for @xmath88 ratio compared to the experimental data is typical for almost all statistical models .",
    "evidently , the too steep rise in @xmath88 behavior is a consequence of the @xmath90 anomaly @xcite .",
    "similar results are reported in refs .",
    "@xcite as the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 selective suppression .",
    "since even an introduction of the separate strangeness freeze - out with the strangeness enhancement factor does not allow us to better describe these ratios , we believe that there is an unclarified physical reason which is responsible for it .    within the present model we also found a selective improvement and a certain degradation of the fit quality of various ratios for different collision energies .",
    "for instance , the @xmath84 ratio is slightly increased for @xmath80 6.3 and 7.6 gev , but the situation drastically changes for @xmath80 12 gev .",
    "the same tendency is typical for @xmath91 . on the contrary , for @xmath92 ratio",
    "there is a noticeably worse data description within sfo+@xmath15 approach at @xmath80 6.3 , 7.6 gev , but for @xmath80 12 gev the fit quality is sizably better compared to all previous approaches .",
    "thus , within the present model we reveal a noticeable change in the trend of some ratios at @xmath80 7.6 - 12 gev .",
    "we have performed an elaborate fit of the data measured at ags , sps and rhic energies within the multi - component hadron resonance gas model . the suggested approach",
    "to separately treat the freeze - outs of strange and non - strange hadrons with the simultaneous @xmath15 fitting gives rise for the top - notch strangeness horn description with @xmath81=1.5/14 .",
    "the developed model clearly demonstrates that the successful fit of hadronic multiplicities includes all the advantages of these two approaches discussed in @xcite . as a result for @xmath80 6.3 , 7.6 , 12 ,",
    "130 gev we found a significant data fit quality improvement .",
    "the achieved total value of @xmath81 is @xmath93 1.05 , while the @xmath15 values are consistent with the conclusion @xmath94 ( within the error bars ) .",
    "a possible exception is the topmost point of the strangeness horn , at which the mean value of the strangeness enhancement factor is @xmath95 , but with the large error bars .",
    "in addition , the description of ratios containing the non - strange particles , especially such as @xmath84 and @xmath91 , gets better compared to previously reported results @xcite . at the same time",
    "the lack of available data at @xmath16 = 2.7 , 3.3 , 3.8 , 4.3 , 9.2 , 62.4 gev forced us to solve the corresponding equations which in combination with the large experimental error bars led to rather large uncertainties of the fitting parameters .    from a significant improvement of the data description",
    "we conclude that the concept of separate chemical freeze - out of strange particles is an essential part of heavy ion collision phenomenology which should be taken into account in further studies of strongly interacting matter properties . however , the remaining problem with @xmath2 , @xmath96 , @xmath4 ratios led us to a conclusion that there is an unclarified physical reason which is responsible for them .",
    "the residual non - equilibration of strange particles found here seems to be weak and , perhaps , the better experimental data will help us to reduce it further .",
    "the obtained description of the hadron multiplicity ratios reached the highest quality ever achieved and this fact demonstrates that the suggested approach is almost a precise tool to elucidate the thermodynamics properties of hadron matter at two chemical freeze - outs . the fresh illustrations to this statement",
    "can be found in @xcite . however , to get more reliable conclusions from this approach we need more experimental data with an essentially higher accuracy .",
