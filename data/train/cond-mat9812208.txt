    "it can be seen from fig [ fig1 ] that the system has a significant screening of the electric field of the test charge at distances considerably larger than the magnetic length .",
    "as the filling factor @xmath28 approaches the value 1/2 , the dependence @xmath67 becomes oscillatory .",
    "note that an increase in the value of @xmath17 weakens the effect .",
    "a decrease in this parameter leads not only to an increase in the amplitude of the effect , but also to a wider range of filling factors for which @xmath67 oscillates as a function of the distance .",

    ", we confine the analysis to two equivalent layers .",
    "fractional quantum hall effect in the system  ( [ 29 ] ) is realized for filling factors @xmath86 ( @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the filling factor per layer ) .",
    "carrying out a procedure analogous to the one carried out in sec .",
    "i , we arrive at the following expression for the action of the electromagnetic field of the system  ( [ 29 ] ) : @xmath89 where @xmath90 matrices @xmath91 and @xmath92 in eq .",

    "( [ 29 ] ) and ( [ 30 ] ) become meaningless for @xmath95 , the expressions  ( [ 31 ] ) and ( [ 32 ] ) remain valid even in this case .",

    "it can be verified that in this case also we arrive at the relations ( [ 31 ] ) and ( [ 32 ] ) .    for the geometry",
    "in which the @xmath15-coordinate of the first and second layer is equal to @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively , we obtain from eq .",

    "it can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ 35])([37 ] ) that screening in a two - layer system depends on parameter @xmath93 as well as @xmath94 .",
    "hence for a fixed value of the filling factor which depends only on the first of these parameters , the expression  ( [ 35 ] ) differs for the cases @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "consequently , a transition from a state with @xmath110 to a state with nonzero @xmath85 ( such a state corresponds to the halperin s wave function ) will be manifested in a variation of the dependence of screened field of a test charge on the distance .",
    "let us consider a system with @xmath112 .",
    "in such a system , the fractional quantum hall effect may correspond to sets of parameters ( @xmath113 and @xmath110 ) and ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the dependence @xmath67 for these two cases for the same values of the system parameters as in sec .",
    "ii and for @xmath116 .",
    "it can be seen from the curves that the dependences @xmath67 differ considerably for these two cases .",
    "an experimental observation of such a sharp variation in screening upon a slight variation in the separation between layers points towards a phase transition between different ground states in a two - layer system .",
    "note that the situation considered in this work differs from the one considered by us in ref .",
    "@xcite where we studied screening in a two - layer system in an infinite medium with two test charges located in the opposite layers .",
    "in such a case , the screening of the test charge field depends only on parameter @xmath93 , and the variation of the spatial distribution of the induced charge during a phase transition between generalized laughlin states is associated just with a variation of this parameter with a simultaneous reversal of the sign of @xmath25 .",
    "only a few of the possible transitions satisfy this condition .",
    "in particular , the transition considered above for @xmath112 ( which is most suitable for observation since it corresponds to lowest level in the hierarchy of the generalized laughlin states ) does not satisfy such a condition .",
    "the origin of the effect considered in this work is associated with the asymmetric arrangement of the test charge relative to the two - layer system . in particular , this is manifested in that a decrease in the separation between layers leads to a suppression of the effect .",
    "thus , we have considered in this work the screening of the electric field of a test charge by a monolayer and a two - layer systems of composite fermions .",
    "the expressions for the screened field are obtained by taking into account the effect of the interface .",
    "it is shown that a partial screening of the test charge electric field occurs in the system at distances much larger than the magnetic length .",
    "the specific form of the dependence of the screened field on the distance from the test charge is modified considerably upon a variation of the ground state of the system .",
    "the observation of the screening effect as a function of the filling factor and separation between layers ( in a two - layer system ) can be treated as a possible experimental verification of the model of composite fermions and the method of observing changes in the topological order in fractional quantum hall systems .",
    "the solutions obtained in this work pertain to the case when the test charge and the electric field detector are placed on the surface of the sample containing a two - dimensional electron layer .",
    "the approach used in this work can be modified to describe a different geometry of the experiment .",
