    "setting the scattering amplitude is the coefficient of the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of an outgoing solution of the reduced wave equation . to establish the aforementioned result , he studies the radiation pattern of a solution which approximates this outgoing solution near the boundary of the obstacle .",

    "the last assumption means that the cut - off resolvent is a fourier integral operator microlocally near some incoming and outgoing directions .",
    "the first assumption is made so that the notion of applying semi - classical pseudodifferential operators ( which here are defined up to residual terms in @xmath88 ) makes sense .",
    "it will be used explicitly in the discussion of the resolvent near a non - trapped trajectory in sections [ snt ] and [ str ] .",
    "we also note that implicit in our assumptions is the fact that @xmath89 is non - resonant , in the sense that the resolvent does not have a pole at @xmath90    we can now state our    * main theorem .",
    "*    _ suppose that assumptions 1 and 2 hold . _",

    "we recover the phases in  see theorem [ tmicrol ] below . we expect that a finer analysis based on our method would give a precise description of amplitudes .",
    "what is different here is the fact that we can handle the cases in which the scattering relation can not be parameterized simply . that always occurs at the transition between the perturbation and free propagation  see figure  [ fig : pert ] .",
