    "charge - symmetry is the equality of proton - proton ( @xmath7 ) and neutron - neutron ( @xmath8 ) forces  after electromagnetic effects are removed .",
    "this symmetry , which is slightly broken , has long been a subject of research in nuclear physics ( for reviews see , e.  g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . traditionally , the empirical information on the charge - asymmetry of the nuclear force comes mainly from few - body systems .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) scattering length in the @xmath3 state plays a special role .",
    "as there exists an almost bound state in that partial wave , the ( negative ) scattering length is extremely sensitive to small differences in the strength of the force .",
    "the @xmath7 effective range parameters ( scattering length , @xmath9 , and effective range , @xmath10 ) are obtained with very high precision from low - energy @xmath7 cross section data . however , since we are interested here in the strong force , electromagnetic effects have to be removed , which introduces model dependence . using several realistic @xmath0 potential models , the pure strong - interaction @xmath7 effective range parameters are determined to be  @xcite @xmath11 where the errors state the uncertainty due to model - dependence .",
    "since @xmath8 scattering experiments are not yet feasible , the @xmath8 effective range parameters are not measured directly ; they are extracted from few - body reactions , mainly @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "recent measurements of these reactions and their analysis have resulted in the following recommended values  @xcite @xmath14 it is thus evident that in the @xmath3 state , the @xmath8 strong interaction is slightly more attractive than the @xmath7 one . from the above semi - empirical values",
    ", we see that charge - symmetry is broken by the following amounts @xmath15    information about charge - symmetry - breaking ( csb ) can also be inferred from binding energy differences of so - called mirror nuclei .",
    "the most studied case is the @xmath16he@xmath16h mirror pair .",
    "experimentally it was found that @xmath16h is more deeply bound than @xmath16he by 764 kev .",
    "model - independent calculations of the coulomb energy difference and other subtle electromagnetic effects yield a binding energy difference of about 683@xmath1729 kev @xcite . it has been shown that the remaining discrepancy can be explained by a charge symmetry breaking nuclear force that is consistent with the empirical asymmetry in the singlet scattering length @xcite .    according to our current understanding , csb is due to a mass difference between the up and down quark and electromagnetic interactions . on the hadronic level , this has various consequences : mixing of mesons of different isospin but same spin and parity ; mass differences between hadrons of the same isospin multiplet .",
    "the difference between the masses of neutron and proton represents the most basic cause for csb .",
    "therefore , it is important to have a very thorough accounting of this effect .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper .    the @xmath18 mass difference , which is well known to be 1.2933 mev  @xcite , affects the kinetic energy of the nucleons .",
    "besides this , it has also an impact on all meson - exchange diagrams that contribute to the nuclear force .    in sect .",
    "ii , we will briefly outline the formalism of the bonn model for the @xmath0 interaction that this study is based upon . in sect .",
    "iii , we will go ",
    "step by step  through the various meson - exchange contributions to the nuclear force and calculate for each step the csb effect due to nucleon mass splitting . in particular , we will present the effect on the singlet effective range parameters and on phase shifts of @xmath0 scattering up to 300 mev laboratory energy and up to orbital angular momentum @xmath19 .",
    "section iv concludes the paper .",
    "we base our investigation on the comprehensive bonn full model for the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "this model has been described in length in the literature  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will summarize here only those facts which are important for the issue under consideration .",
    "the bonn model uses an effective , field - theoretic approach , in which the interaction between two nucleons is created solely from the exchange of mesons ; namely , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . besides the nucleon ,",
    "also the @xmath25 isobar is taken into account . in its original version",
    "@xcite , the bonn model used averages for baryon and meson masses and , thus , was charge - independent ; it was fitted to the neutron - proton data . in this paper , these subtleties will be treated accurately .",
    "the interaction lagrangians involving pions are @xmath26 with @xmath27 the nucleon , @xmath28 the @xmath29 ( rarita - schwinger spinor ) , and @xmath30 the pion fields .",
    "@xmath31 are the usual pauli matrices describing isospin 1/2 and @xmath32 is the isospin transition operator . h.c . denotes the hermitean conjugate .",
    "the above lagrangians are devided by @xmath33 to make the coupling constants @xmath34 dimensionless . following established conventions  @xcite",
    ", we always use @xmath33 as scaling mass .",
    "it may be tempting to use @xmath35 for @xmath36 coupling .",
    "notice , however , that the scaling mass could be anything",
    ". therefore , it is reasonable to keep the scaling mass constant within su(3 ) multiplets  @xcite .",
    "this avoids the creation of unmotivated charge - dependence .",
    "it is important to stress that  as evidenced by the above @xmath37 langrangian  we use the pseudovector ( pv ) or gradient coupling for the pion . alternatively , on can also use the pseudoscalar ( ps ) coupling , @xmath38    for an on - shell process , the two couplings yield the same if the coupling constants are related by , @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 the masses of the two nucleons involved .",
    "this relationship is charge - dependent due to the two nucleon masses . as a consequence",
    ", csb effects will come out ( noticably ! ) different depending on if the ps or the pv coupling is used .",
    "non - linear realizations of chiral symmetry , which are currently fashionable , prefer the pv coupling over the ps coupling . following this trend , we use the pv coupling .",
    "the couplings of @xmath42-mesons to nucleons and @xmath29-isobars are described by the lagrangians @xmath43 we have to draw attention to the fact that  no matter to which nucleon the @xmath42 couples  in the second part of the @xmath44 langrangian , we always use the proton mass @xmath45 as scaling mass . with this",
    ", we follow established conventions , as discussed above in conjunction with the pion langrangians .",
    "we note that disregarding this point would generate noticable , but unmotivated csb .",
    "finally , the lagrangians for @xmath46 and @xmath47 are : @xmath48    starting from these lagrangians , irreducible diagrams up to fourth order are evaluated using old - fashioned / time - ordered perturbation theory . some important diagrams ( but not all )",
    "are shown in figs .",
    "the sum of all irreducible diagrams included in the model is , by definition , the quasi - potential @xmath49 .",
    "mathematically , this quasi - potential is the kernel of the scattering equation . for an uncoupled partial wave with angular momentum @xmath50",
    ", this equation reads : @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 the magnitude of the relative momenta of the two interacting nucleons in the initial , intermediate , and final state , respectively ; @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 the correct mass of the nucleon involved in the scattering process under consideration .",
    "the principal value is denoted by @xmath58 and @xmath59 is commonly called the k - matrix . by solving this equation , the kernel / quasi - potential is iterated infinitely many times .",
    "this is equivalent to solving the schroedinger equation .    from the on - shell @xmath59-matrix , phase shifts for uncoupled partial waves",
    "are obtained through : @xmath60 where @xmath52 denotes the on - shell momentum in the center - of - mass system of the two nucleons which is related to the laboratory kinetic energy by @xmath61 .",
    "further details concerning the formalism can be found in appendices a to c of ref .",
    "it is the purpose of the present investigation to take the nucleon mass splitting accurately into account , which leads to csb .",
    "therefore , we use exact values for the proton mass @xmath45 and neutron mass @xmath62  @xcite : @xmath63    we start with @xmath7 scattering for which the one - boson - exchange contribution is depicted in fig .",
    "1b and @xmath1-exchange contributions are shown in fig .",
    "2b , 3b , and 4b . note that in all of these diagrams , the proton carries the exact proton mass @xmath45 and the neutron , which occurs in some intermediate states , carries the exact neutron mass @xmath62 . for the @xmath29-isobars , that are excited in some intermediate states in figs .  3 and 4 ,",
    "the average mass @xmath64 mev is used .    for the @xmath7 case , our model yields @xmath65 fm for the singlet scattering length and 2.88 fm for the corresponding effective range , consistent with eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .    switching now ",
    "step by step  from @xmath7 to @xmath8 scattering will change the effective range parameters and the phase shifts , in violation of charge - symmetry .",
    "the differences that occur for the effective range parameters are given in table  i and ii .",
    "note that the relationship between the csb potential and the corresponding change of the scattering length , @xmath66 , is highly non - linear . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , when the scattering length changes from @xmath67 to @xmath68 due to a csb potential @xmath69 , the relationship is @xmath70 or @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 the zero - energy @xmath3 wave functions normalized such that @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the perturbation expansion concerns the invers scattering length . as clearly evident from eq .",
    "( 20 ) , the change of the scattering length depends on the `` starting value '' @xmath67 to which the effect is added . in our calculations ,",
    "csb effects are generated step by step , which implies that the starting value @xmath67 is different for different csb effects .",
    "this distorts the relative size of the scattering length differences . to make the relative comparison meaningful ,",
    "we have rescaled our results for @xmath66 according to a prescription given by ericson and miller  @xcite , which goes as follows .",
    "assume the `` starting value '' for the scattering length is @xmath67 and a certain csb effect brings it up to @xmath68 .",
    "then , the resulting scattering length difference @xmath75 is rescaled by @xmath76 with @xmath77 fm and @xmath78 fm . this will make @xmath79 independent of the choice for @xmath67 .",
    "the numbers given in table i and ii for @xmath66 are all rescaled according to this prescription .    to state the effects of csb on the @xmath0 phase shifts , we introduce for each @xmath80 state the csb phase shift difference @xmath81 , defined by @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the @xmath8 and @xmath84 the @xmath7 phase shifts ( without electromagnetic effects ) , respectively .",
    "the irreducible diagrams included in the quasi - potential / kernel can be subdivided into several groups .",
    "after discussing the effect from the kinetic energy , we will describe each group of diagrams and the implications for csb .    1 .",
    "* kinetic energy * ( kin .  en . ) . the kinetic energy is smaller for the neutron because of its larger mass .",
    "this reduces the magnitude of the energy - denominator in eq .",
    "( 15 ) for @xmath8 scattering as compared to @xmath7 , thus , enhancing the ( attractive ) integral term for @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , the factor @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( 16 ) is larger for the larger nucleon mass , which results in an overall enhancement of the magnitude of the @xmath8 phase shifts .",
    "the combined effect yields larger @xmath8 phase shifts as compared to @xmath7 if the nuclear potential is attractive , and vice versa if the nuclear potential is repulsive . this can be understood more easily in the frame work of the radial schroedinger equation in which the effective potential is @xmath86 .",
    "thus , no matter if the nuclear potential @xmath49 is attractive or repulsive , its effect on the phase shifts is always enhanced for the larger nucleon mass @xmath57 .",
    "this explains why in @xmath87 the csb phase shift splitting , eq .",
    "( 22 ) , comes out negative ( repulsive potential , negative phase shift ) , while it is positive in all other partial waves listed in table iii ( column ` kin.en . ' ) where the potentials are attractive ( positive phase shifts ) .",
    "the magnitude of the singlet scattering length increases by 0.25 fm ( cf .",
    "table i , column ` kin.en . ' ) for @xmath8 scattering as compared to @xmath7 .",
    "this is , of course , well known , and the effect on the scattering length is usually quoted to be 0.30 fm  @xcite .",
    "our value is slightly smaller which can be attributed to the use of relativistic kinetic energies in our model .",
    "* one - boson - exchange * ( obe , fig .  1 ) contributions mediated by @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . in the bonn model  @xcite , the @xmath47 describes only the correlated @xmath1 exchange in @xmath90-wave ( and not the uncorrelate @xmath1 exchange since the latter is calculated explicitly , cf",
    ".  figs .",
    "symmetry is broken by the fact that for @xmath7 scattering the proton mass is used in the dirac spinors representing the four external legs ( fig .",
    "1b ) , while for @xmath8 scattering the neutron mass is applied ( fig .",
    "the csb effect from the obe diagrams is extremely small ( cf .",
    "table  i and iii , column ` obe ' ) .",
    "* @xmath1-exchange with @xmath0 intermediate states * ( @xmath91 ) , fig  2 .",
    "notice first that only non - iterative diagrams are to be considered , since the iterative ones are generated by the scattering equation ( 15 ) from the obe diagrams .",
    "in our calculations , we include always all time - orderings ( except those with anti - baryons in intermediate states ) ; to save space , we display , however , only a few characteristic graphs in fig .  2 ( this is also true for all diagrams shown or discussed below ) . part ( a ) of fig .",
    "2 applies to @xmath8 scattering , while part ( b ) refers to @xmath7 scattering . notice that when charged - pion exchange is involved , the intermediate - state nucleon differs from that of the external legs",
    "this is an important subtlety that we account for accurately in our calculations ; neglecting this effect causes a systematic error in the order of 100% .",
    "numerical results for this class of diagrams are given in table  ii and iv , column ` @xmath91 ' .",
    "@xmath1-exchange with n@xmath29 intermediate states * ( @xmath92 ) , fig .",
    "3 . this class of diagrams causes by far the largest csb effect on the scattering length ( table  ii ) as well as on the phase shifts ( table  iv ) .",
    "again , it is important in all of these diagrams to take the intermediate - state nucleon mass correctly into account .",
    "* @xmath1-exchange with @xmath93 intermediate states * ( @xmath94 ) , fig .  4 .",
    "the effects are smaller than for @xmath92 because there are no nucleon intermediate states .",
    "thus , the nucleon mass splitting affects only the outer legs which typically results in a small effect . 6 .",
    "* @xmath2-exchange with @xmath0 intermediate states * ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "graphically , the @xmath95 diagrams can be obtained by replacing in each diagram of fig .  2 , one pion by a @xmath42-meson of the same charge state ( because of this simple analogy",
    ", we do not show the @xmath2 diagrams explicitly here ) .",
    "in our calculations , the csb effects of the @xmath2 diagrams with @xmath0 intermediate states are taken into account accurately .",
    "the effect is typically opposite to the one from @xmath91 exchange .",
    "* @xmath2-exchange with n@xmath29 intermediate states * ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "concerning the @xmath2 diagrams with @xmath29 intermediate states a comment is in place . in the bonn model  @xcite ,",
    "the crossed @xmath2 diagrams with @xmath29 intermediate states are included in terms of an approximation .",
    "it is assumed that they differ from the corresponding box diagrams ( i.  e. , the diagrams on the left - hand side of figs .  3 and the ones in the first row of fig .",
    "4a and 4b , but with one @xmath20 replaced by one @xmath42 ) only by the isospin factor .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 box diagrams with @xmath29 intermediate states are multiplied by an isospin factor that is equal to the sum of the isospin factors for box and crossed box .",
    "the @xmath96 effect is in general substantial and typically of the opposite sign as compared to @xmath92 .",
    "* @xmath2-exchange with @xmath93 intermediate states * ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the effects are very small .",
    "* further @xmath98 and @xmath99 contributions * ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the bonn potential also includes some @xmath98-exchanges that can be approximated in terms of @xmath101 diagrams and @xmath99-exchanges of @xmath102 type .",
    "the sum of these contributions is small .",
    "these diagrams have @xmath0 intermediate states ( similar to fig .  2 , but with one of the two exchanged pions replaced by an isospin - zero boson ) and , thus , are of intermediate range . except for @xmath3 ,",
    "their effect is negligible .",
    "this finishes our detailed presentation of the relevant diagrams and their csb effects which are plotted in figs .  5 and 6 .",
    "the total csb splitting of the singlet scattering length amounts to 1.58 fm ( cf .",
    "last column of table  i ) which agrees well with the empirical value @xmath103 fm , eq .",
    "the sum of all csb effects on phase shifts is given in the last column of table  iii and plotted by the solid curve in fig .",
    "the largest total effect listed in table  iii is 1.8 deg in @xmath3 at 1 mev .",
    "in the @xmath4-wave , the effect decreases with energy and is 0.15 deg at 300 mev . in @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "waves the csb effect on phase shifts increases with energy and is typically in the order of 0.1 deg at 300 mev .",
    "we do not list our results for partial waves with @xmath104 , since the csb effect becomes negligibly small for high @xmath105 : less than 0.02 deg at 300 mev and 0.01 deg or less at 200 mev for @xmath106 and @xmath107 waves and even smaller for higher partial waves .",
    "since the pion is involved in almost all diagrams considered in this study , the csb effect depends on the @xmath37 coupling constant . in the present calculations , we follow the bonn model  @xcite",
    ": we assume charge - independence of the coupling constant and use @xmath108 which , via eq .",
    "( 10 ) , translates into @xmath109 . in recent years",
    ", there has been some controversy about the precise value of the @xmath37 coupling constant .",
    "unfortunately , the problem is far from being settled . based upon @xmath0 phase shift analysis",
    ", the nijmegen group  @xcite advocates the ` small ' charge - independent value @xmath110 , while a very recent determination by the uppsala group  @xcite based upon high precision @xmath111 charge - exchange data at 162 mev seems to confirm in the large ` text book ' value @xmath112 .",
    "other recent determinations are in - between the two extremes : the vpi group  @xcite quotes @xmath113 from @xmath114 and @xmath0 analysis with no evidence for charge - dependence .",
    "bugg and machleidt  @xcite obtain @xmath115 and @xmath116 from the analysis of @xmath0 elastic data between 210 and 800 mev . because of this large uncertainty in the @xmath37 coupling constant , it is of interest to know how the csb effects depends on this constant .",
    "naturally , the @xmath1 contributions are proportional to @xmath117  @xcite and the @xmath2 ones to @xmath118 .",
    "since the two contributions carry ( in general ) opposite signs and vary in their relative magnitude from partial wave to partial wave , there is no simple rule for how the total csb effect depends on @xmath119 .",
    "the value @xmath120 is currently fashionable among the new generation of high - precision @xmath0 potentials  @xcite .",
    "for that reason , we have repeated our csb calculations using @xmath120 and find that the total @xmath66 is reduced by about 15% as compared to the calculation using @xmath121 ( table i ) .",
    "the phase shift differences are reduced by roughly the same percentage in most partial waves .",
    "the exact numbers for @xmath120 will be published elsewhere .",
    "based upon the bonn meson - exchange model for the @xmath0 interaction , we have calulated the csb effects due to nucleon mass splitting on the phase shifts of @xmath0 scattering and the singlet effective range parameters .",
    "we give results for partial waves up to @xmath19 and laboratory energies below 300 mev .",
    "concerning phase shift differences , we find the largest in the @xmath3 state where they are most noticable at low energy ; e.  g. , at 1 mev , the difference is 1.8 deg , indicating that the _ nn _ nuclear force is more attractive than the _ pp _ one .",
    "the @xmath3 phase shift difference decreases with increasing energy and is about 0.15 deg at 300 mev .",
    "the csb effect on the phase shifts of higher partial waves is small ; in @xmath5 and @xmath6 waves , typically in the order of 0.1 deg at 300 mev and less at lower energies .",
    "this is substantially smaller than what is required phenomenologically to solve the so - called @xmath122 puzzle in elastic nucleon - deuteron scattering at low energies  @xcite .",
    "the major part of the csb effect comes from diagrams of @xmath1 exchange where those with @xmath123 intermediate states make the largest contribution .",
    "we also study the csb effect from irreducible diagrams that exchange a @xmath20 and @xmath42 meson . to our knowledge , this class of diagrams has never before been considered in any calculation of the csb nuclear force .",
    "we find that the @xmath2 diagrams give rise to non - negligible csb contributions that are typically opposite to the @xmath1 effects . in most partial waves ,",
    "the @xmath2 effect reduces the csb from @xmath1 exchange in the order of 50% .",
    "coon and niskanen  @xcite have investigated the csb effect on the singlet scattering length from the diagrams of figs .  2 and 3 , using a nonrelativistic model .",
    "their total result , @xmath124 fm ( applying the dtrs @xmath0 potential  @xcite and a cutoff mass of 1 gev at the pion vertices ) , agrees well with our total . however , there are large differences in the details : from @xmath91 and @xmath92 , coon and niskanen obtain 1.28 fm and 0.24 fm , respectively ; while we get 0.37 fm and 1.85 fm , respectively .",
    "thus , the ratio of the two contributions is very different . from ref .",
    "@xcite it is known , that the @xmath92 contribution to the nuclear force is about four times the one from @xmath91 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the csb effect scales roughly with the size of the contribution that generates it .",
    "this is true for our result , which is why we have confidence in our findings . in the bonn model ,",
    "a cutoff mass of 1.2 gev is used at the pion vertices , while coon and niskanen use 1 gev .",
    "this may explain why our overall contribution from @xmath1 exchange is larger .",
    "on the other hand , our model also includes the important @xmath2 diagrams ( that are omitted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which reduce the overall csb effect .    from the diagrams displayed in figs .",
    "3 and 4 it is evident that additional csb could be created from @xmath29-mass splitting .",
    "unfortunately , the charge - splitting of the @xmath125-baryon mass is not well known  @xcite .",
    "since our present investigation is restricted to reliably known baryon - mass splitting , we do not consider any @xmath29-mass splitting and use the average value for the @xmath29-mass ( 1232 mev ) throughout .",
    "it is , however , worthwhile to mention that our model includes everything needed for a systematic investigation of csb effcts caused by an assumed @xmath29-mass splitting .",
    "this may be an intersting topic for a future study .",
    "traditionally , it was believed that @xmath126 mixing explains essentially all csb in the nuclear force .",
    "however , recently some doubt has been cast on this paradigm .",
    "some researchers  @xcite found that @xmath126 exchange may have a substantial @xmath127 dependence such as to cause this contribution to nearly vanish in @xmath0 .",
    "our finding that the empirically known csb in the nuclear force can be explained solely from nucleon mass splitting ( leaving essentially no room for additional csb contributions from @xmath126 mixing or other sources ) fits well into this new scenario .",
    "however , since the issue of the @xmath127 dependence of @xmath126 exchange is by no means settled ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for discussion and more references ) , it is premature to draw any definite conclusions .",
