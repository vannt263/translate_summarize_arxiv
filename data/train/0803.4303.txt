    "we will mostly concentrate on the hartee approximation ( i.e. when @xmath43 this is because the main conclusions concerning the aharonov - bohm oscillations in the system at hand are qualitatively similar for the spinless hartree case ( @xmath44 ) and the spin - resolved dft case ( @xmath45 ) .",

    "we also calculate the conductance of the open dot in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation where the self - consistent electron density and potential are given by the standard tf equation at zero field .",
    "this approximation does not capture effects related to electron - electron interaction in quantizing magnetic field such as formation of compressible and incompressible strips and hence it corresponds to noninteracting one - electron approach where , however , the total confinement is given by a smooth fixed realistic potential , see refs . for details .    in order to provide correct interpretation of the results reported in this paper , it is important to outline the validity and limitations of the present approach .",
    "our calculations correspond to a so - called standard approach@xcite based on the ground - state dft in the landauer formula .",

    "this is due to the uncorrected self - interaction errors in the standard dft approach ( related to the lack of the derivative discontinuity in the exchange - correlation potential ) for the case when localization of charge is expected to occur . because of this , we do not expect the present approach to provide a reliable conductance for the case of the weak coupling @xmath59 ( fig .",

    "this is because the interferometer contains a large number of electrons , @xmath60 and thus the electrostatic charging caused by a single electron hardly affects the total confining potential of the interferometer .",
    "thus the results of the present study provide an accurate information concerning the locations of the propagating states and the structure of compressible / incompressible strips in the interferometer .",

    "was designed such that the intermode scattering was practically absent . as a result , the lowest @xmath6 states propagated through the dot adiabatically with very little reflection , whereas highest states with the transmission @xmath112 gave rise to the coulomb blockade effects in the conductance .",
    "we argued in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] that while the present standard approach  is not expected to describe single - electron tunneling effects ( leading to the coulomb blockade peaks in the conductance ) , one can expect that it correctly reproduces a global electrostatics of the interferometer and microscopic structure of the quantum mechanical edge states regardless whether the conductance is dominated by a single - electron charging or not . in its turn , such information can be a basis for phenomenological models aiming at description of the effects of single - electron charging in the ab interferometer .",
    "such model calculations have been recently reported by rosenow and halperin who studied the effect of the single electron charging on the periodicity of the ab interferometer@xcite . in the absence of detailed microscopic picture of the edge state structure in the interferometer",
    ", the authors considered several possible scenarios of coupling between the edge states in the leads and states in the island .",
    "the important feature of their model was the presence of the compressible region in the center of the island .",
    "our macroscopic calculations however do not support the assumption of the formation of the compressible strip inside the interferometer .",
    "our calculations for @xmath24 demonstrate only the onset of the formation of the compressible region where just a few resonant levels of the dot become pinned to the fermi energy .",
    "the formation of the compressible region inside the interferometer occurs at larger fields corresponding to @xmath59 ( where however the conductance is dominated by the single - electron effects anyway because @xmath113 note that dharma - wardana _ et al . _",
    "s model@xcite of single electron charging in the open ab interferometer does not seem to rely on the presence of the compressible island inside the dot .",
    "a microscopic picture emerging from our calculation can be summarized as follows .",
    "( _ i _ ) the lowest @xmath6 states pass through the qpc almost adiabatically contributing very little to the conductance oscillations ( see fig . [",
    "fig : psi ] ( d ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : psi_dft ] ( a)-(c ) ) .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the state @xmath10 passes through the interferometer with the transmission probability @xmath114 giving rise to the transition region between the conductance plateaus that is modulated by the ab oscillations . inside the interferometer this state retains its edge - state character ( see fig . [",
    "fig : psi ] ( e ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : psi_dft ] ( d ) ) .",
    "the ab oscillations are related to excitation of the resonant states of the dot that are situated close to the dot boundary and thus are strongly coupled to the leads .",
    "these states are manifest in the density of states as relatively broad peaks with broadening @xmath115 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : resonances],[fig : ldos],[fig : gvg ] ) .",
    "( _ iii _ ) the @xmath10 state ( and , to a lesser extend , all lowest @xmath110 states ) also excite very narrow resonant states with broadening @xmath116 situated inside the island and thus weakly coupled to the leads ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : resonances],[fig : ldos],[fig : gvg ] ) .",
    "these states are pinned to the fermi energy and the excitation of these states corresponds to the onset of formation of the compressible island inside the interferometer .",
    "note however that compressible island inside the interferometer forms at much larger fields , see inset to fig .",
    "fig : ab_oscillations ( d ) .",
    "because both broad and narrow states correspond to the addition ( or subtraction ) of one electron to ( or from ) the dot , both of them can contribute to single - electron charging giving rise to modification of the conventional ab periodicity according to eq .",
    "( period_f_c ) .",
    "( _ iv _ ) finally , the @xmath117 state is almost completely reflected by the qpc , see ( see fig . [",
    "fig : psi ] ( f ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : psi_dft ] ( e ) ) .",
    "this state might or might not form a compressible strip in the leads ( depending on whether it is respectively the last filled ll or not ) . however , because of the weak coupling to the states in the dot , the compressibility of this state has a little significance for the transport through the interferometer .",
    "finally we stress that our approach corresponds to the coherent electron transport through the interferometer .",
    "it does not account for incoherent processes such as spin flips and interlevel scattering that might lead to redistribution of electrons between outer ( broad ) and inner ( narrow ) resonant states in the dot .",
    "such electron transfer between different lls is shown to influence an addition spectrum of a closed ( strongly coulomb - blockaded ) dot@xcite . however , in the case of open dot considered in this study it is not clear whether such processes would significantly affect the conductance of the interferometer , because the dwell time of the electrons in the open dot might be much smaller that inelastic scattering time associated with the interlevel relaxation .",
    "we provide a microscopic picture of the quantum transport in the aharonov - bohm interferometer taking into account electron interaction within the hartree and the spin - dft approximations .",
    "we discuss the structure of the edge states for different numbers of the landau levels in the leads , structure of the states in the dot , coupling between the states in the dot and the leads , and the formation of compressible / incompressible strips in the interferometer .",
    "we discuss the applicability of our approach and argue that it provides a reliable description of a global electrostatics of the interferometer and a microscopic structure of the quantum mechanical edge states and coupling between them . on the other hand , the present approach",
    "is not expected to reproduce the conductance in the weak coupling regime of the coulomb blockade , if the electron number inside the interferometer becomes quantized .",
    "we compare our conductance calculation with the experimentgoldman_2005,goldman_2007 and argue that the inability of the present approach to reproduce the unexpected periodicity of the ab oscillations , eq .",
    "( [ period_f_c ] ) , can be taken as an indirect evidence that this periodicity is caused by the coulomb blockade - type effects .",
    "our transport calculations thus demonstrate that an accurate description of the conductance of the ab interferometer would require theories that go beyond the standard approach@xcite based on the ground - state dft in the landauer formula that was utilized in the present paper .",
    "such the theories ( as e.g. reported in refs . ) essentially rely on specific phenomenological models of the states in the leads and in the central island and their coupling in the interferometer .",
    "our work , therefore , provides a basis for such the theories , giving a detailed microscopic description of the propagating states and the global electrostatics in the system at hand .",
    "such a microscopic description is summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in particular , our findings does not directly support the model of rosenow and halperin that relies on the existence of the compressible island inside the interferometer and its coupling to the leads .",
    "our findings thus indicate that an accurate explanation of the unexpected periodicity of the ab oscillations might need exploring alternative theories based on the microscopic picture of interesting electrons developed in the present paper .    _",
