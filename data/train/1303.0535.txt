    "boundary - layer theory is crucial in understanding why certain phenomena occur .",
    "it is well known that the instability of boundary layers is sensitive to the mean velocity profile , so that a small distortion to the basic flow may have a detrimental effect on its stability .",
    "prandtl ( 1904)*@xcite * proposed that viscous effects would be confined to thin layers adjacent to boundaries in the case of the motion of fluids with very little viscosity i.e. in the case of flows for which the characteristic reynolds number , @xmath5 , is large . in a more general sense",
    "we will use boundary - layer theory ( blt ) to refer to any large - reynolds - number . ho and denn studied low reynolds number stability for plane poiseuille flow by using a numerical scheme based on the shooting method .",
    "they found that at low reynolds numbers no instabilities occur , but the numerical method led to artificial instabilities.lee and finlayson used a similar numerical method to study both poiseuille and couette flow , and confirmed the absence of instabilities at low reynolds number .",
    "r. n. ray et al * @xcite * investigated the linear stability of plane poiseuille flow at small reynolds number of a conducting oldroyd fluid in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "they found that viscoelastic parameters have destabilizing effect and magnetic field has a stabilizing effect in the field of flow but no instabilities are found .    in this paper , we study the linear stability of boundary layer in a plane + poiseuille flow . for this , we derive two fourth - order equations name modified fourth - order orr - sommerfeld equations governing the stability analysis in boundary layer for the flow .",
    "the first is obtained by making dimensionless quantities by the inertial effects .",
    "the second takes into account the form adopted by the rheologists i.e. make the quantities dimensionless by normalizing by the viscous effects .",
    "this allowed us to see the effect of each type of normalization on the stability in the boundary layer .",
    "so , we solve numerically the corresponding eigenvalues problems .",
    "we employ matlab in all our numerical computations to find eigenvalues .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "the boundary layer theory is presented . in the third section we present the general formulation , highlighting the fundamental equations that model the flat - plate boundary layer flow according to the normalization by inertial and viscous effects . in the fourth section",
    "the modified orr - sommerfeld equations governing the stability analysis in boundary layer are checked and in the fifth section , analysis of the stability is investigated .",
    "the conclusions and perspectives are presented in the final section .",
    "when applying the theory of complex potential around an airfoil in considering the model of inviscid incompressible irrotational plan flow , we know that the model allows to deduce the lift but the drag is zero .",
    "this is contrary to experimental observations which show that the drag affects all flows of real fluids .",
    "these are viscous .",
    "they adhere to the walls and the tangential component of the velocity is zero if the wall is fixed",
    ". the latter condition can be satisfied by the perfect fluid . moreover ,",
    "the irrotational condition is far from reality as we know that the production of vorticity occurs at the walls . to remedy the deficiencies of the theory of perfect fluid",
    ", it must appeal to the theory of the boundary layer which is a necessary correction for flows with high reynolds numbers .",
    "theoris the boundary layer is due to l. prandtl**@xcite**. the boundary layer is the area of the flow which is close to the wall or of an obstacle present in a uniform flow at the upstream infinity or on the confining walls of internal flow . within",
    "the boundary layer is a thin zone , it is estimated that viscous effects are of the same magnitude as the inertial effects .",
    "the boundary layer is the place of intense generation of vorticity which will not diffuse into the area outside thereof .",
    "this leads to a very modern concept of comprehensive approach to the problem by breaking it down into two areas : firstly the boundary layer where we will consider the viscous effects in a model of simplified navier - stokes and other from the outer area where we will use the complex potential theory in the inviscid incompressible flow .",
    "this outer zone has speeds which are of the same order of magnitude as that of the incident flow .",
    "the boundary layer along an obstacle is therefore thin since the fluid travel great distances downstream of the leading edge during the time interval during which the vortex diffuse only a small distance from the wall .",
    "the creation of vorticity in the boundary layer allows the physical realization of the fluid flow around the profile .",
    "this movement gives rise to a wake in the area near the trailing edge .",
    "the importance of the wake depend on the shape of the obstacle and the angle of incidence of the upstream flow at the leading edge .",
    "we consider incompressible flow of a fluid with constant density @xmath6 and dynamic viscosity @xmath7 , past a body with typical length @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that a typical velocity scale is @xmath9 , and the reynolds number is given by    @xmath10    for simplicity we will , for the most part , consider two - dimensional incompressible flows , although many of our statements can be generalised to three - dimensional flowsand / or compressible flows .",
    "boundary layer theory applies to flows where there are extensive inviscid regions separated by thin shear layers , say , of typical width @xmath11 .",
    "for one such shear layer take local dimensional cartesian coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 along and across the shear layer respectively .",
    "denote the corresponding velocity components by @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , pressure by @xmath16 and time by @xmath17 . on the basis of scaling arguments",
    "it then follows that    @xmath18    further , it can also be deduced that the key approximations in classical boundary layer theory are that the pressure is constant across the shear layer i.e.    @xmath19    and that streamwise diffusion is negligible , i.e. if @xmath20 represents any variable    @xmath21    the former approximation is more significant dynamically .",
    "now , using the transformations    @xmath22    and taking the limit @xmath23 , the boundary layer theory equations can be deduced from the navier - stokes equations :    @xmath24    @xmath25    for flow past a rigid body the appropriate boundary conditions are @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the inviscid slip velocity past the body .",
    "further , from ( 6 ) evaluated at the edge of the boundary layer    @xmath28    we define the viscous blowing velocity out of the boundary layer to be    @xmath29    @xmath30 indicates the strength of blowing , or suction , at the edge of the boundary layer induced by viscous effects .",
    "it is good diagnostic for dynamically significant effects within the boundary layer much better than , say , the wall shear @xmath31 which can remain regular while @xmath32 becomes unbounded .",
    "consider an incompressible boundary layer over a flat plate as illustrated in the following figure**@xcite**.        the streamwise coordinate @xmath33 is scaled with the length scale @xmath34 , which is a fixed distance from the leading edge .",
    "the wall - normal and spanwise coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , are scaled with the boundary - layer parameter @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and @xmath39 is the streamwise freestream velocity at the distance @xmath34 from the leading edge .",
    "the streamwise velocity @xmath40 is scaled with @xmath39 , while the wall- normal and spanwise velocities @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , are scaled with @xmath43 . the pressure @xmath44 is scaled with @xmath45 and the time @xmath46 is scaled with @xmath47 . the reynolds numbers used here are defined as @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is useful to note the relations @xmath50 .",
    "we want to study the linear stability of a high reynolds number flow .",
    "the non - dimensional navier ",
    "stokes equations for an incompressible flow where pressure and time are normalized by inertial effects    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54    where @xmath55    are linearized around a two - dimensional , steady base flow @xmath56 to obtain the stability equations for the spatial evolution of three - dimensional , time - dependent disturbances @xmath57 .",
    "the base flow and the disturbances are scaled in the same way .",
    "the disturbances are taken to be periodic in the spanwise direction and time , which allows us to assume solutions of the form    @xmath58    where @xmath59 represents either one of the disturbances @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 or @xmath44 .",
    "the complex streamwise wave number @xmath60 captures the fast wavelike variation of the modes and is therefore scaled with @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath60 itself is assumed to vary slowly with @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath33 is scaled with @xmath34 , the factor @xmath3 appears in front of the integral .",
    "the @xmath33-dependence in the amplitude function @xmath62 includes the weak variation of the disturbances .",
    "the real spanwise wave number @xmath63 and angular frequency @xmath64 are scaled in a consistent way with @xmath36 and @xmath46 , respectively . introducing the assump- tion ( 11 ) in the linearized navier ",
    "stokes equations and neglecting all third order terms in @xmath65 or higher , we arrive at the parabolized stability equations in boundary - layer scalings    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    @xmath69    where @xmath70 .",
    "if we normalize pressure and time by viscous effects i.e. @xmath46 scaled with @xmath71 and @xmath44 scaled with @xmath72 the navier - stokes equations take the following forms    @xmath51    @xmath73    @xmath74    @xmath75    the linearized navier - stokes equations with the previous disturbances under the same considerations become @xmath66    @xmath76    @xmath77    @xmath78    where @xmath70 .",
    "considering temporal the stability problem with @xmath79 and @xmath80 real , we will simplify the problem",
    ". our strategy will be first to eliminate @xmath14 , @xmath81 , @xmath16 to leave a single equation in @xmath15 .",
    "this can be used finally to determine the linear stability ( or instability ) in the boundary layer oy the base flow .",
    "remember that @xmath82 and if @xmath83 , the flow is stable ; @xmath84 , the flow is unstable and we have neutral stability if @xmath4 .",
    "taking @xmath85 + @xmath86 we get    @xmath87    using the continuity equation ( 16 ) , ( 28 ) becomes @xmath88    operating across ( 29 ) with @xmath89 , using the assumptions in boundary layer and the equation ( 18 ) we get the modified orr - sommerfeld equation for the boundary layer    @xmath90    considering normalization with viscous effects we would have    @xmath91",
    "we put equations ( 30)-(31 ) respectively in the form @xmath92 and @xmath93 in order to investigate the application of the squire theorem , consider first the normalization with inertial effects ( [ iner ] ) . often , however , we are only interested in the instability that appears first as the control parameter @xmath94 is increased . in this case ,",
    "squire s theorem tells us that we need only consider @xmath0 disturbances .",
    "consider a base state @xmath95 .",
    "imagine a growing @xmath96 disturbance to this base state at reynolds number @xmath97 , with wavenumbers @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "this corresponds to a solution @xmath101 , @xmath15 with @xmath84 ( of the modified orr - sommerfeld equation @xmath102 now consider a @xmath0 disturbance at a reynolds number @xmath103 .",
    "this has @xmath104 , @xmath105 and must satisfy the @xmath0 modified orr - sommerfeld equation @xmath106 for values @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , this @xmath0 modified orr - sommerfeld equation has the form @xmath110 which is exactly the same as [ td ] .",
    "it must therefore have the same growing solution @xmath111 with @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , corresponding to the growing @xmath96 disturbance at @xmath112 with @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , there exists a growing @xmath0 disturbance at @xmath103 with @xmath109 and @xmath113 .",
    "these conditions lead to @xmath114 and we get that the disturbances are two - dimensional . finally , we get @xmath115 , not @xmath116 . and so , we can not applied the squire s theorem in the boundary layer of the flow .    using the same assumptions in ( [ vis ] ) , we get first @xmath117 with @xmath118 i.e. @xmath119 and",
    "secondly @xmath120 with @xmath118 i.e. @xmath119 . so we have first @xmath121 and secondly @xmath116 because @xmath122 .",
    "we see therefore that we must take @xmath123 and so @xmath114 . we find the same result that the disturbances are two - dimensional and then squire s theorem ca nt be applied .",
    "finally , we still consider our three - dimensional disturbances so without using the theorem of squire .",
    "thus we write @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",
    "this will allow us to deduce numerically whether the application of squire s theorem in the boundary layer .",
    "indeed @xmath1 corresponds to a two dimensional disturbance i.e @xmath126 .",

    "are solved numerically with the suitable boundary conditions .",
