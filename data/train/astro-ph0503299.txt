    "estimating accurate masses of self - gravitating systems , such as star clusters , is of central importance in astronomy .",
    "most estimates of such masses have been based on radial velocities from a few tracers of the system .",
    "however , the advent of the next generation telescopes , proper motion data will become more accurate and reliable within an observation time of a few years .",
    "proper motions at the milky way s center has already proven a boon ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "combined with radial velocities , proper motions can provide us with 5 components of the 6-dimensional phase space of a large number of tracers .",
    "such a wealth of information will help to set accurate limits to masses of objects in the local group .",
    "apart from the masses , this new kinematic data can uncover more subtle dynamic processes in star clusters , helping us to verify some of our present understanding and models of star clusters .",
    "the idea of using proper motion data for cluster dynamics is not new .",
    "kudworth was the first to implement this idea in the 70 s , but he was limited by the data and telescopes of the time .",
    "@xcite showed that proper motion data was sufficient to predict the dynamic mass of the cluster .",
    "however , there was no complete proper motion data sample of a star cluster at the time .    at the present ,",
    "data from hst have reached sufficient quality to study internal cluster kinematics astrometrically @xcite . also , diffraction limited imaging at the vlt",
    ", keck and other 8 m class telescopes is now a reality , and with the next generation of telescopes coming online ( e.g. the lbt with 23 m resolution imaging , @xcite ) , proper motions are becoming a broadly competitive dynamical tool , and are not restricted to areas with long time - baseline data , such as @xmath0 centauri ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence , it is crucial to understand how best to use proper motion data for setting mass limits and to learn to deal with the systematic and random errors inherent to this technique .    in section [ sec : estimators ] , we undertake a review of present mass estimators and develop tools geared towards proper motion data , in the hope of extracting maximum information about the same .",
    "we then apply these tools to a proper motion data set of @xmath0 centauri ( figure [ fig : problem ] ) in section [ sec : omega ] to predict the mass of the cluster .",
    "the virial theorem has been traditionally and widely used to estimate the masses of self - gravitational systems from the motions of individual tracers or constituents . however",
    ", a major drawback of estimators that are based on the virial theorem is that they tend to be biased and formally have an infinite variance .",
    "@xcite compared the virial mass estimator to an alternative method called the projected mass estimator first proposed by @xcite for binary galaxies .",
    "@xcite later expanded their work to develop the projected mass estimator for self - gravitating systems .    while for many self - gravitating systems ( e.g. extra - galactic ones ) radial velocities are the only measurable quantities , it has become increasingly clear in the last decade that proper motions studies could be used to estimate the masses of nearby clusters .",
    "@xcite extended this approach to include proper motions in the mass estimate of the open cluster m35 .",
    "projected mass estimators try to exploit the directly observable , projected properties of a self - gravitating system .",
    "in addition , they are efficient , unbiased and have a finite variance .",
    "the estimators are derived by taking moments of the jeans equation for a spherical system .",
    "the projected mass estimator for proper motion velocities can be rewritten as ( @xcite eq .",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the radial and transverse proper motion velocities , @xmath7 is the projected distance and @xmath8 is the total mass of the cluster .",
    "since the projected mass estimator involves a line - of - sight projection , care must be taken to have a proper radial sampling of the tracers of the system .",
    "note that in the projected mass estimator , particles at larger projected distances are given more weight than particles at smaller projected distances , because of the inability to reconstruct the true radial distance for particles at small projected distance .",
    "the projected mass estimator becomes biased when the velocity measurements have significant error bars .",
    "the estimated mass bias is a quadratic effect w.r.t the error in velocity .",
    "however , we can modify the projected mass estimator to take into account the velocity errors . since @xmath9 ,",
    "a reasonable unbiased estimator is @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "the projected mass estimator does not provide a `` formula '' for mass error estimates .",
    "however bootstrapping methods can be used to set limits to the mass .",
    "correcting for the errors in the velocities as in the above estimator is a statistical process , and may fail with a limited number of particles .",
    "overestimation or underestimation of the errors in the proper motion velocities may bias the estimator .      here",
    "we develop a maximum likelihood method mass estimator that is geared towards proper motion measurements and accounts for significant , and individually varying , error bars .",
    "it uses high - precision measurements effectively and extracts maximum information from low - precision velocity measurements .",
    "the key to this method is a suitable model to predict the proper motion velocity dispersions ( both radial and transverse ) as a function of the projected radius .",
    "for example , the velocity dispersion can be predicted by the family of king models or by jeans modelling of the cluster .",
    "the data then simply set the mass normalization of the model .",
    "let us consider that we can model the proper motion velocity distribution locally as a maxwellian distribution .",
    "thus the probability of a star in the cluster to have a certain proper motion velocity @xmath12 given that the total mass of the cluster is @xmath8 is : @xmath13 where the velocity dispersions vary with radius and scale with mass as @xmath14 and @xmath7 is the projected radial distance .    on the other hand ,",
    "every observation of proper motion velocity @xmath15 has a certain error @xmath16 associated with it .",
    "the probability of actually measuring the velocity @xmath15 at a projected distance @xmath17 is a gaussian distribution given by : @xmath18    thus the probability that the cluster has a mass @xmath8 given an observation of proper motion velocity @xmath15 , at a projected distance @xmath17 with an observational error @xmath16 is , @xmath19    the log - likelihood of the cluster to have a mass @xmath8 given @xmath20 observations is : @xmath21 where one sums over both radial and transverse proper motion velocities .",
    "the most probable mass of the cluster corresponds to the parameter @xmath8 of the maximum of the likelihood function .",
    "limits of uncertainty of @xmath22 can also be set to the mass of the cluster by searching for the parameter @xmath8 such that @xmath23 ( in the astrophysical context see @xcite , whose statistic s @xmath24 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the southern globular cluster @xmath0 centauri ( ngc 5139 ) is approximately at a distance of 5.1 kpc @xcite .",
    "its large mass and size sets it apart from the bulk of globular clusters in the galaxy . in recent years , it has evoked interest because of the recent discovery of its multiple populations which implies a complex formation history @xcite .",
    "the cluster is also isotropic @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a definite rotation in the cluster .",
    "@xcite reports that there is very little mass segregation in the cluster , which means that the cluster is not in equipartition .",
    "there has also been a considerable debate on the mass of @xmath0 centauri .",
    "previous estimates of the mass of @xmath0 centauri have ranged from @xmath25 @xcite to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "setting accurate limits to the mass of @xmath0 centauri is essential to differentiate between the various theories of its formation process .",
    "@xcite have completed a project providing the largest available set of proper motion data for a star cluster .",
    "this large data set on @xmath0 centauri made available offers a fore - taste of the proper motion data which may be soon made available for more clusters .      for our mass estimates",
    ", we use the proper motion studies of @xmath0 centauri @xcite , which are based on 100 plates obtained with the yale - columbia 66 cm refractor , and ranging in epoch from 1931 till 1935 and 1978 till 1983 , differential proper motions are obtained for 9847 stars . the limiting magnitude ( photographic )",
    "is 16.0 for the centre of the cluster , 16.5 for the outer part .",
    "the precisions of the proper motions range from an average of 0.1 mas / yr for the brightest to an average of 0.65 mas / yr for the faintest stars .",
    "@xcite uses the proper motions to study the internal kinematics of the cluster .",
    "the centre of the cluster was taken to be @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that the distance of the cluster is 5.1 kpc away @xcite .",
    "we project the absolute celestial coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 into cartesian coordinates ( relative to the cluster centre ) onto the plane of the sky along the line - of - sight vector through the cluster centre : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a scaling factor ( @xmath32 to have @xmath33 and @xmath34 in radians and @xmath35 to have @xmath33 and @xmath34 in units of degrees ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the cluster centre coordinates , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite divide their proper motion observations into 4 classes based on the errors in the proper motion determination which depend upon crowding and plate quality .",
    "they also calculate the membership probability of each star to belong to the cluster .",
    "we only use stars taken from high - quality classes 0 and 1 , since the errors appear to be relatively well behaved ( see fig . 11 of @xcite ) .",
    "the mass estimators are very sensitive to outliers and field stars in the cluster .",
    "thus the mass estimates show a direct correlation to our membership probability cut - off criterion .",
    "we use a conservative cut - off criterion : we use stars having a membership probability higher than or equal to @xmath40% ( @xmath41 ) to belong to the cluster .",
    "this gives us a limited sample of 4056 stars , which have a @xmath42 probability to belong to the cluster , due to the integral nature of the membership probability assigned by @xcite .",
    "these we term as class a stars .",
    "there are 772 stars having a membership probability between @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 to belong to the cluster .",
    "these are class b stars . to diminish the effect of any non - members on the mass estimators ,",
    "we construct a monte - carlo test by using any subset of class b stars along with class a stars . in choosing our subset ,",
    "we ensure that the number of class b stars does not exceed @xmath46 of the class a stars .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : problem ] , the errors in the proper motion data becomes comparable to the velocity dispersion profile at a magnitude of 16 , especially for stars in the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "thus reasonable and robust estimates of the mass can be obtained at magnitude of 15 .",
    "recent proper motions observations of @xmath0 centauri by @xcite with the wfpc2 aboard the hst have shown that the data from @xcite may be problematic at the centre of the cluster .",
    "@xcite obtain proper motions dispersions much lower than reported in the proper motion study of @xcite ; however , the two groups agree with each other farther out .",
    "this will not affect our mass estimates from the pme , as it gives a lower precedence to data at the centre of the cluster .",
    "for the mle , we neglect stars from the inner region of @xmath47 ; this is indicated by the shaded region of figure [ fig : problem ] .",
    "the radial stellar profile was taken from @xcite .      in this section",
    ", we attempt to estimate the mass of @xmath0 centauri from the proper motion data set of @xcite using the tools we have developed in the previous section .",
    "first , we apply the pme ( eq . [ eqn : proj2 ] ) to the data set ; then we use the mle from section [ sec : mle ] with various models of the projected velocity dispersion profile .",
    "one must be wary of selection effects in applying the pme .",
    "crowding effects and lack of colour information at the centre of the cluster leads to a bias in the radial sampling of stars with proper motions .",
    "a simple check can be made by calculating the average projected radius as a function of the limiting magnitude for our restricted sample : we find that fainter sub - samples lie at larger radii .",
    "thus we have a larger number of faint stars away from the centre of the cluster in the sample .    ) as a function of the class 0 and 1 stars from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath48 error bars are calculated using bootstrapping .",
    "the closed symbols use class a stars only .",
    "the open symbols use both class a and class b stars in a monte - carlo method.,width=317 ]    we can correct for this effect by using a monte - carlo algorithm to choose our tracers for the pme such that we always maintain the surface density profile of the cluster . for this purpose ,",
    "we fit a kings density profile to surface density data ( see figure [ fig : problem ] ) published by @xcite .",
    "the 1-@xmath49 error bars ( see figure [ fig : estimator ] ) are calculated using bootstrapping . at very bright magnitudes",
    ", we have high precision measurements , but only few stars .",
    "the large error bars demonstrate the lack of information due to the limited amount of tracers of the system .    in trying to extract the maximum information in an economic way with the pme , one has to trade off between the above two effects . at magnitude of 15 using only class a stars , the pme estimates the mass of the cluster as @xmath50 , while the combination of class a as well as class b stars in a monte - carlo method predicts @xmath51 .",
    "to apply the mle to @xmath0 centauri , we require a suitable model for the velocity dispersion .",
    "we start with the classic king model @xcite framework for this task .",
    "given a suitable dynamical model of the cluster , the tracers of the system effectively scale the projected velocity dispersion curve with the help of a maximum likelihood method to estimate the independent parameter : the mass of the cluster .    as with the pme , we also correct for `` proper radial '' sampling .",
    "we also neglect all stars in the central region of @xmath52 due to the uncertainty in the central velocity dispersion from crowding effects . at most @xmath53 of all the tracers of our limited sample",
    "are present in this central region .      in figure",
    "[ fig : single - mass - kings - model ] , a single mass king model is fit to the surface density profile of @xmath0 centauri .",
    "the central scaled potential used is @xmath54 , to match the surface radial profile @xcite .",
    "since the search for anisotropy in @xmath0 centauri has yielded very limited results @xcite , we are justified in using one integral models .",
    "even though the surface density profile provides a relatively good fit , we are unable to reproduce the projected velocity dispersion profile in the inner parts of the cluster ( even well outside @xmath52 ) .",
    "the resulting mass estimate from the mle as a function of limiting magnitude is also shown .    at magnitude of 15 using only class a stars ,",
    "the mle with the king model estimates the mass of the cluster as @xmath55 , while the combination of class a as well as class b stars in a monte - carlo method predicts @xmath56 .      without assuming any restrictive form of a distribution function",
    ", we can still reconstruct the velocity dispersion using jeans equation . under the hypothesis of isotropy and neglecting the rotation in the cluster ,",
    "the isotropic jeans equation for a spherical system is : @xmath57 where @xmath49 is the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath58 is the observable number density distribution , and @xmath59 is the potential generated by the matter distribution at the considered point .",
    "note that @xmath0 centauri is one of the few systems known to be isotropic from direct observations .",
    "we use the three dimensional number density distribution by @xcite using non - parametric analysis .",
    "assuming that mass does not follow light , we try to disentangle the mass profile from the luminosity profile , by giving it an independent king profile @xcite .",
    "note that the king mass profile only defines the potential well of the cluster , and does not assume the particular form of the kings distribution function .",
    "the mass profile was adjusted until the form of the velocity dispersion curve predicted by jeans equation matched the kinematic data of @xmath0 centauri as derived by @xcite .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : jeans - model ] .",
    "the velocity dispersion curve is then used to predict the mass of the cluster using the mle .",
    "the shape of the mass profile is consistent with the fact that @xmath0 centauri exhibits very little equipartition , as shown by the results of @xcite , where it was found that stars of a considerable range of mass down the main sequence of @xmath0 centauri differed very little in their radial distribution ; the differences found indicate only a small evolution towards equipartition .",
    "the lack of equipartition is to be expected with a cluster of such large mass , and hence a very long relaxation time .    at lower magnitude",
    "the error - bars are large due to lack of information in the limited number of tracers . at magnitude of 15 using only class a stars ,",
    "the mle with the jeans model estimates the mass of the cluster as @xmath50 , while the combination of class a as well as class b stars in a monte - carlo method predicts @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting mle mass estimates for the cluster from the two models differ by @xmath3 because of the difference in the velocity dispersion profiles at the central region of the cluster ( @xmath61 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the results of the mle with jeans modelling are consistent with the results of the pme .",
    "in this paper , we implement two independent methods to determine the mass of a cluster from the proper motion data .",
    "when using the pme , one must be careful to correct for the errors in the velocities ( eq . [ eqn : proj2 ] ) and to use a `` proper radial sampling '' to correct for the incompleteness at the centre of the cluster .",
    "the pme provides us an unbiased and robust estimate of the mass of the cluster , so long as the errors in the velocities are as large as the velocity dispersion itself .",
    "using stars above this limiting magnitude leads us to a systematic error .",
    "we independently estimated the mass of the cluster using the mle in conjunction with two dynamical models for the velocity dispersion profile . in this paper",
    ", we use the king model and jeans modelling .",
    "disentangling the mass profile from the density profile in the jeans modelling , gives us a better prediction of the shape of the velocity dispersion profile .",
    "both models give us very similar mass estimates of the cluster within a @xmath3 systematic error .",
    "the mass estimators are susceptible to a systematic bias due to contamination by outliers and field stars in the cluster .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the absolute mass estimate is the distance to @xmath0 centauri which enters as the third power .",
    "a comparison of the radial velocity dispersion @xcite with the proper motion velocity dispersions indicates a distance of the cluster of @xmath62 kpc @xcite",
    ". however we follow @xcite in interpreting these results with caution , and assume that the cluster is at a distance of @xmath63 kpc away .    thus , when implemented correctly , the two independent methods predict the mass of the cluster within @xmath64 on the basis of the @xcite data .",
    "the mass of @xmath0 centauri is @xmath65^{3}$ ] with a @xmath2 statistical error and a @xmath3 systematic error which arises from the various models used .",
