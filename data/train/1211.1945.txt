    "studying the behavior of solid state systems under the simultaneous action of disorder and interactions is a significant challenge in condensed matter physics .",
    "strong correlations in interacting systems often give rise to sharp quasiparticles .",
    "scattering of such quasiparticles from weak disorder should just limit their lifetime . for strong disorder and no interactions ,",
    "it is well understood@xcite that constructive interference of the backscattered waves can localize single particles such that they lose their itinerancy .",
    "if interactions are turned on , there is no consensus about the effect of disorder on the quasiparticles of interacting systems .",
    "for example , consider polarons , which are the focus of this work , and which are quasiparticles comprising a charge carrier plus a cloud of phonons describing the lattice distortions in the vicinity of the charge .",
    "if one views the polaron as a particle with a renormalized mass , large disorder should result in anderson localization .",
    "however , phonon - assisted hopping of carriers between localized states is well established as a conduction process in lightly doped semiconductors.@xcite this suggests that , for suitable electron - phonon couplings , polarons may still be itinerant in a disorder potential that would localize particles with the same effective mass .",
    "a possible explanation for this was offered recently in refs . and , where the momentum average ( ma ) approximation was used to show that the electron - phonon coupling renormalizes the disorder potential in a strongly energy - dependent manner , so that the effective disorder seen by polarons can be drastically different from the bare disorder",
    ".    references and focused on the effect of a single impurity potential on the polaron , although , as explained there , ma generalizes straightforwardly to other types of on - site potentials , including disordered ones .",
    "as such , it could be used to study numerically the effect of disorder , by generating results for various disorder realizations and analyzing their statistics .",
    "such results have already been obtained for the holstein@xcite polaron using the statistical dynamic mean - field theory ( sdmft).@xcite given the quite different underlying approximations , it might be useful to check whether ma leads to similar results .",
    "a different approach , valid for weak disorder , is to use perturbation theory and perform the disorder average analytically , similarly to the born approximation widely employed for charge carriers in the absence of electron - phonon coupling.@xcite because localization can not be described within a perturbational calculation , the polaron eigenstates remain extended and self - averaging over all disorder realizations is appropriate .    here",
    "we follow the latter approach and calculate , using ma and for weak disorder , the disorder - averaged green s function of the holstein polaron and the resulting polaron lifetime and energy shift .",
    "ma is an accurate analytical method originally developed for calculating the green s function of holstein polaron in clean systems,@xcite and later extended to other types of coupling.@xcite ma is nonperturbative in the electron - phonon coupling as it sums all diagrams in the self - energy expansion , up to exponentially small terms that are neglected .",
    "it also has a variational interpretation , in terms of the allowed structure of the polaron cloud.@xcite ma can also be systematically improved by increasing this variational space,@xcite giving rise to the ma@xmath0 , ma@xmath1 , etc . , flavors which become more accurate but at an increased computational cost .",
    "because here we focus only on the lowest - energy polaron states , which are already accurately described at the ma@xmath0 level , in the following we restrict ourselves to this flavor and call it ma for simplicity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the hamiltonian for a single holstein polaron in a lattice with random on - site energies is @xmath2 where the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian , @xmath3 , is divided into @xmath4 , describing the on - site disorder potential experienced by the charge carrier , and @xmath5 describing the kinetic energy of charge carrier plus the ( optical ) phonon energies ( @xmath6 ) .",

    "the strength of disorder , @xmath19 , is taken to be weak compared to polaron bandwidth in the clean system , so that it can be treated perturbationally . as a result , the polaronic picture remains valid but its lifetime is expected to become finite due to scattering from the disorder potential @xmath20 .",
    "it is precisely this disorder - induced lifetime that interests us .    since @xmath21 is weak compared to other terms in the hamiltonian",
    ", we treat it as a perturbation . dividing the hamiltonian as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the hamiltonian of the holstein polaron in the clean lattice , we use dyson s identity , @xmath24 , to relate the resolvent @xmath25 of the system with disorder , to @xmath26 of the clean system . to the second order in @xmath21",
    ", we find @xmath27    because disorder breaks translational invariance , the eigenstates for any individual disorder realization are not labeled by the momentum @xmath28 .",
    "however , averaging over all disorder configurations restores the translational invariance and makes momentum a good quantum number again . as a result , @xmath29 and we only need to calculate the diagonal matrix element :    @xmath30    here , @xmath31 is the polaron green s function in the clean system . for completeness , its ma solution is briefly reviewed in appendix a.    since @xmath32 for symmetric disorder , the first - order contribution vanishes ( a finite average can be removed trivially by an overall shift of the energy ) . because of uncorrelated disorder , @xmath33 , and the disorder - averaged green s function becomes @xmath34    the challenge is to use ma to calculate the matrix elements appearing in the second term to the same level of accuracy as @xmath35.@xcite    these matrix elements can be broken into products of generalized green s functions by inserting identity operators , @xmath36 , between the creation and annihilation operators . since the ma flavor we use here is equivalent with assuming that the phonon cloud only extends over one site,@xcite at this level of accuracy it suffices to truncate @xmath37 , i.e. , to ignore states with phonons at two or more sites ( such states can be added systematically in higher flavors of ma ) .",
    "this leads to : @xmath38 this expression involves two sets of generalized propagators , namely @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we now evaluate them .",
    "first , as detailed in appendix b , to the level of accuracy of ma , for @xmath41 the first propagator vanishes unless @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , we have to evaluate @xmath43 for @xmath41 .",
    "note that @xmath44 is already known : @xmath45 , since momentum is a good quantum number in the clean system .",

    "this broadening measures the rate at which the polaron leaves that momentum state due to scattering from the impurity potential @xmath20 . in a clean system ,",

    "mathematically , this is a consequence of the fact that ( in the absence of disorder ) the polaron self - energy @xmath66 has a vanishing imaginary part for all energies inside the polaron band .",

    "( [ self ] ) corresponds to @xmath68 , therefore @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the momentum - averaged free propagator .",
    "the resulting spectral weight has a peak of width @xmath71 centred at energy @xmath72 , found from the pole condition @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    because @xmath76 is small for weak disorder , we approximate @xmath77 . using this in eq .",

    "( [ w00 ] ) , the inverse lifetime becomes @xmath83 however , @xmath84 is proportional to the total density of states ( dos ) for the clean system , @xmath85 so that : @xmath86 the last equality is simply fermi s golden rule . since the density of states vanishes outside the bandwidth of the clean system , this result predicts infinite lifetime for all states with @xmath87 , and finite lifetime for all states in between .",
    "we will return to this point below .    when the electron - phonon coupling is turned on the analysis is performed similarly , but now using the appropriate total self - energy .",
    "the results are discussed next .",
    "we first consider weak electron - phonon coupling , @xmath88 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) we plot the polaron inverse lifetime for states in the polaron band , for two different values of the disorder strength , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( squares and circles , respectively ) .",

    "the weak disorder does not shift the eigenstates significantly .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , the average density of states in the disordered system @xmath100 is nearly identical to that of the clean system , although the band becomes slightly broader with increasing @xmath62 .",
    "the inverse lifetime vanishes below the clean system bandedge , @xmath101 , and above it increases like @xmath102 , which is the expected clean system dos at the bottom of the band .",
    "this is very similar to the @xmath67 results , except for the renormalization of the dos by the electron - phonon interactions .",
    "indeed , if we think of the polaron as a simple quasiparticle whose density of states is @xmath103 [ renormalized from @xmath104 for a free electron ] , the inverse lifetimes we find at the bottom of the polaron band are in good agreement with those predicted by fermi s golden rule ( fgr ) , i.e. , with @xmath105 ( see full lines ) .",
    "while the agreement between the two is good near the bottom of the band , it becomes systematically worse at higher energies . to verify that this amount of disorder is still sufficiently small so that the disagreement is not due to using perturbational results outside their validity range , we also show average t - matrix ( ata ) results ( dashed lines ) .",

    "it is well known@xcite that this flavor of ma fails to reproduce the correct polaron+one phonon continuum , which should start at @xmath107 ( this problem is fixed by ma@xmath1 and higher flavors ) .",
    "one consequence is that ma overestimates the bandwidth of the polaron at weak couplings . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) we see that the polaron band extends well past @xmath107 .",

    "the inverse lifetime for a free electron with the same momentum is shown by triangles .",

    "both curves show the expected @xmath114 increase predicted by fermi s golden rule , but the polaron lifetime is somewhat shorter .",
    "the most likely reason for this is the renormalization of the polaron mass by interactions . indeed ,",
    "if instead we plot @xmath109 vs @xmath110 for the polaron ( empty squares ) , the results are much closer to those of the free electron , especially for small values of the disorder .",
    "the conclusion , thus far , is that fermi s golden rule agrees well with our results at energies where this flavor of ma can be trusted . in other words , at weak electron - phonon coupling , the effect of disorder can be quantitatively understood if we think of the polaron as a simple particle with a renormalized mass ( or dos ) , and use fermi s golden rule .",

    "for comparison , the polaron dos in the absence of disorder , @xmath103 , is also shown ( dashed line ) .",
    "let us consider the dos , first .",
    "as in the other cases , we see that with increasing disorder , the bandedge shifts down to lower energies . however , the effect is quantitatively much more significant here than at weaker couplings because the polaron band is much narrower .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where we show the same densities of states but over the full polaron band .",
    "one surprise is that the entire polaron band moves to lower energies with increasing disorder .",
    "this is different from what happens for a simple particle , where the band broadens symmetrically on both sides .",
    "the different behavior at the upper edge is likely due to the difference in their spectra .",
    "while for a simple particle its band is the only feature in its spectrum , the spectrum of the polaron is quite complicated , with many other features , such as a band associated with the second bound state , the polaron+one - phonon continuum , etc . , lying above the polaron band.@xcite with increasing disorder all these features should move toward lower energies .",
    "level repulsion from higher - energy states would explain why the upper edge of the polaron band moves to lower energies .",
    "displayed in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , but now shown for the entire polaron band . ]    for the inverse lifetime we see that , as in the other cases , it vanishes for states with energy below the bandedge of the clean system , @xmath120 . because the shift of the disorder - averaged dos is now significant , this means that , for a quite large energy range at the bottom of the band , the polaron has an infinite lifetime despite the presence of disorder .",
    "we emphasize that this is qualitatively similar to the result for a simple particle at the bottom of its band ; the effect is simply quantitatively more pronounced here .",
    "the meaning of this ( un - physical ) infinite lifetime for these low - energy states is discussed in the conclusions ; briefly , we believe that it signals a failure of the perturbation theory at these energies .",
    "these low - energy states are most susceptible to localization , so the perturbational calculation and its predictions are suspect here .    for higher - energy polaron states with @xmath121 , the lifetime in the presence of disorder becomes finite , as expected . however , here the ma results disagrees quantitatively with the fgr and ata results at all energies .",
    "the latter two are nearly indistinguishable , suggesting again that these levels of disorder are small enough that perturbation theory should be valid .",
    "the disagreement can not be blamed on ma in this case ; at such strong couplings and correspondingly low energies , ma is extremely accurate for the entire polaron band.@xcite the disagreement is , therefore , meaningful .",
    "its origin can be quite easily traced .",
    "if we explicitly separate the @xmath122 contribution in the disorder self - energy , eq .",
    "( [ self ] ) becomes @xmath123        if the contribution of the terms with @xmath124 can be ignored , this result leads to fermi s golden rule , since @xmath125 .",
    "the disagreement between ma and fgr , then , comes from the contribution of the terms with @xmath124 .",
    "these terms can not be ignored at strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "consider , for instance , @xmath126 , which is proportional to @xmath49 and therefore is responsible for its appearance in @xmath127 .",
    "if we fourier transform to real times , @xmath128 is proportional to the amplitude of probability that if an electron is injected in the system at some moment , at a time @xmath129 later we find the electron in the presence of @xmath54 bosons , all at the same site . at strong couplings , the electron dresses itself with a large phonon cloud to become a polaron , so the probability of finding it with many phonons in its vicinity should be considerable , while the probability of finding the electron without any phonons @xmath130 is exponentially small . in the large @xmath98 limit , the terms which are expected to contribute most are those with @xmath131 , i.e. , values close to the average number of phonons in the polaron cloud .",
    "in contrast , for small @xmath98 the phonon cloud is very fragile and , in fact , most of the time the electron is alone ( resulting in a large quasiparticle weight ) .",
    "this is why , for weak coupling , keeping only the @xmath122 term in the sum provides a good approximation .",
    "these considerations are illustrated diagramatically in fig .",
    "panel ( i ) shows the born approximation for the disorder averaged green s function of a carrier , which leads to fermi golden s rule expression for the lifetime , as already discussed .",
    "panel ( ii ) shows its equivalent for the disorder averaged green s function of the polaron ; as discussed above , this is equivalent with keeping only the @xmath122 term in the disorder self - energy , eq .",
    "( [ self ] ) .",
    "since each clean polaron propagator starts and ends with a free carrier propagator , this approximation means that the electron can scatter on disorder only in the absence of phonons ; this is why this approximation fails at large electron - phonon coupling , where a large phonon cloud forms .",
    "in contrast , the full ma expression includes diagrams such as shown in panel ( iv ) , where phonon and disorder lines cross .",
    "one can think of these as leading to an effective renormalization of the disorder strength , especially since these diagrams are very similar to those which result in the renormalization of a single impurity potential , discussed in refs . and .    our results in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] reveal that this renormalization of the disorder ( considerably ) lowers the polaron lifetime .",
    "thus , the strong electron - phonon coupling effectively enhances the strength of the disorder potential .",
    "why this is so is not easy to infer from the results for a single impurity potential , where renormalization can either increase or decrease the bare potential , and even change its sign , and all these behaviors are seen at different energies ( retardation effects are very significant ) . in any event ,",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that this renormalization is quantitatively significant .    a more detailed picture of the evolution of @xmath132 and @xmath133 with disorder @xmath62 at strong coupling @xmath98 is shown in fig .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] showed that using the fgr estimate , i.e. , @xmath146 , is quantitatively wrong .",

    "the disagreement is even worse .",
    "this shows that for intermediate and large electron - phonon coupling , where a heavy small polaron forms , its lifetime in the presence of disorder is not described quantitatively by the predictions corresponding to a simple particle with renormalized mass .",
    "the polaron has an internal structure which manifests itself in significant corrections to fermi s golden rule even for weak disorder .",
    "the scattering of the electron in the presence of its phonon cloud is quite different from that of a simple particle of the same effective mass , but without a cloud.@xcite",
    "using ma to deal with the electron - phonon coupling and perturbation theory to deal with the weak disorder , we derived an expression for the disorder - averaged green s function of the holstein polaron in a simple cubic lattice with random on - site energies .",
    "this allowed us to find an analytic expression for the lowest - order contribution from disorder to the polaron self - energy .",
    "the disorder - averaged spectral weight was used to extract the lifetime and energy shift of various polaron states . for weak electron - phonon coupling",
    ", we found that the ma results are in reasonable quantitative agreement with those predicted by fermi s golden rule for a free particle with an appropriately renormalized mass .    at intermediate and larger electron - phonon coupling where a small polaron forms , however , the ma results quantitatively disagree with",
    "fermi s golden rule estimate everywhere the lifetime is finite and for all levels of disorder .",
    "the reason for this is the fact that the scattering of the electron in the presence of its ( robust ) phonon cloud is quite different from the scattering of a simple particle with renormalized mass .",
    "this is the same physics that leads to a significant renormalization of the disorder potential seen by a polaron as compared to the bare disorder.@xcite this demonstrates that , in the small polaron limit , it is wrong to assume that the only effect of the polaron cloud is to renormalize the polaron s mass .",
    "it is important to note that this calculation is only valid for weak disorder .",
    "it is based on perturbation theory , and in principle it can be improved by going to higher orders along the same lines we used to calculate the lowest - order contribution .",
    "however , one should remember that as disorder becomes stronger , anderson localization will eventually occur , and that this can not be captured within perturbation theory .",
    "also , once disorder is large enough to lead to localization , the disorder - averaged green s function loses its meaning and usefulness .",
    "instead , here the signature of localization becomes manifest in the distribution of various quantities such as the local density of states , not in their average value .",
    "a surprise , at least at first sight , is the fact that this calculation predicts an infinite lifetime for a range of energies at the bottom of the polaron band .",
    "this interval can include a significant fraction of the polaron states , especially at stronger electron - phonon coupling and larger disorder .",
    "as we already mentioned , this is in fact similar to what happens for a free particle , which also is predicted , within this level of perturbation theory , to have an infinite lifetime for all momenta for which @xmath147 .",
    "the difference is only quantitative : the energy shift for a free particle is tiny compared with its @xmath148 bandwidth , whereas for a small polaron this shift can be comparable with its significantly narrower bandwidth even for rather weak disorder .    a likely reason for this can be inferred from the fact that , for a free particle , states at the band edge become localized immediately upon introduction of disorder . in other words , we already know that there is a finite range of energies ( which , for weak disorder , falls outside the free particle bandwidth ) where treating disorder perturbationally and calculating the disorder - averaged green s function is meaningless .",
    "it is then reasonable to conclude that the states for which this perturbational scheme predicts infinite lifetimes are , in fact , already localized .",
    "if this is correct and generalizes to the polaron case , it suggests that , unlike for a free particle , for a polaron localization sets in differently at the lower vs the upper polaron bandedge . we have already speculated that this difference may be due to the influence of the higher - energy states that exist in the polaron spectrum .",
    "confirmation of these conclusions will require a study going beyond a perturbational treatment of disorder .",
