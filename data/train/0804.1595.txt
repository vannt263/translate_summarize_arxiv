    "the rare - earth nitrides ( rn , r = rare - earth atom ) have gained attention recently as simple ( nacl ) structures for which the influence of strong correlations on the electronic band structures can be treated with some confidence @xcite . in",
    "parallel with theoretical advances there has developed an experimental interest in the growth and passivation of thin films @xcite .",
    "this interplay of theory and experiment has revealed a number of interesting properties of both fundamental and technological importance .",
    "firstly the ambient - temperature paramagnetic phase has a narrow indirect gap that varies systematically across the series . secondly in the ferromagnetic state ( which may be the ground state for them all ) they are predicted to have spin - polarised carriers , opening the potential to doped spintronic structures .",
    "early data on these compounds were plagued by a lack of stoichiometric reproducibility and a rapid degradation of the rn under atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties in particular are very sensitive to nitrogen vacancies and oxygen impurities , which are difficult to control in these materials . even the exchange interactions between the rare earth @xmath10 spins are not well understood , though a number of theoretical models have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the exchange is usually described to operate within two competitive channels of superexchange via the nitrogen atom .",
    "the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction is configured at @xmath11 and is believed to be ferromagnetic .",
    "it strongly depends on the carrier concentration and becomes dominant when rkky indirect interactions take place via the polarisation of conduction electrons .",
    "the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction is configured at @xmath12 , is antiferromagnetic and in principle dominant for non - metals .",
    "note that the existence of a ferromagnetic order in semiconducting rare - earth nitrides implies that a ferromagnetic interaction dominates even in the absence of free carriers @xcite .",
    "the most thoroughly studied of these compounds is gdn , which has a half - filled @xmath10 shell with the maximum @xmath13 net spin and zero net orbital angular momentum .",
    "it is ferromagnetic below @xmath14  k , with a saturation moment of @xmath15 and is an indirect - gap semiconductor with an optical gap of @xmath16  ev in the paramagnetic phase , reduced to @xmath17  ev below the curie temperature @xcite . for the lighter rare - earths ,",
    "hund s rules specify that @xmath18 is anti - parallel to @xmath19 in the ground state . within that scenario smn",
    "is of special interest ; sm@xmath6 , with two electrons below half - filling , has @xmath20 and @xmath21 and a net magnetic moment given by @xmath22 .",
    "there is thus the potential for sm compounds to condense into a ferromagnetic phase in which the spins are ferromagnetically ordered , but with their spin moment nearly cancelled by an opposing orbital moment .",
    "moments substantially smaller than the free - ion moment of @xmath23 are not unknown in ferromagnetic sm compounds @xcite , but its occurrence in a semiconductor has to our knowledge not been reported previously .",
    "such a material offers special advantages for spintronics : ( i ) it can inject spin - polarised electrons into a conventional semiconductor without the deleterious effects of a fringe magnetic field @xcite , and ( ii ) in principle it can form field - free , fully spin - polarised electronically active structures .",
    "early magnetic measurements suggested that smn was antiferromagnetic below @xmath24  k @xcite , but this was not confirmed by neutron diffraction @xcite , suggesting that it might indeed be ferromagnetic but with near - cancellation between the spin and orbital moments .",
    "more recently we reported clear ferromagnetism in gdn @xcite and dyn @xcite , but somewhat weaker ferromagnetic evidence in smn @xcite .",
    "the resistivities of the films show them all to be semiconductors , with the expected anomaly at @xmath0 signalling a narrowed gap in the ferromagnetic state . in the present work we report magnetic experiments performed on thicker smn films , seeking to resolve the uncertainties concerning the magnetic state of this unusual material , and clear picture of near - zero moment ferromagnetism emerges .",
    "smn films were grown in a vacuum chamber pumped to a base pressure in the @xmath25  mbar range .",
    "sm metal was evaporated in the presence of an atmosphere of pure n@xmath26 gas at a pressure of @xmath27  mbar ; the growth conditions , the structure and stoichiometry have been reported previously @xcite . for the present measurements",
    "the films were deposited on si substrates covered by their natural oxide .",
    "x - ray diffraction exhibits the bragg peaks of only the rock salt cubic structure and establishes the films as untextured polycrystalline with an average crystal grain size of @xmath28  nm .",
    "the lattice parameter ( @xmath29   ) is consistent with the previous data for the rare earth nitride series , confirming that samarium is trivalent .",
    "all ex - situ measurements are performed on films protected by a cap layer of nanocrystalline gan .",
    "conductivity and x - ray spectroscopies on the films have established them to be semiconductors in both the ambient - temperature state and to @xmath30  k in the magnetically ordered low temperature state  @xcite .",
    "three films of differing thickness ( @xmath31  nm ) were used for magnetic measurements reported here .",
    "these magnetic properties were investigated with a squid magnetometer ( quantum design mpms ) working up to a maximum applied field of @xmath2  tesla .",
    "all experiments were performed with the magnetic field applied parallel to the film plane .",
    "the films were prepared in parallel on both thick ( @xmath32 m ) and thin ( @xmath33 m ) si substrates in order to apply more reliable corrections for substrate signals , which are of the same order of magnitude as the smn signal .",
    "si is diamagnetic and the susceptibility is supposed to be temperature independent .",
    "the susceptibility measured on the uncovered si substrates is in agreement with the theoretical susceptibility @xmath34 at room temperature within a @xmath35 error .",
    "this si signal is characterized well enough to permit a trouble - free correction in the data shown below .",
    "the magnetic signal from the capping layer is somewhat more problematic .",
    "gan is weakly paramagnetic mainly because self - doping is provided by n vacancies , for which we collected reference data from a measurement on a si substrate covered with a gan layer of the same thickness . in a phenomenological approach",
    ", we have fit the temperature variation of the magnetisation using a theoretical calculation by sonder and schweinler @xcite predicting a modified curie law for the susceptibility of interacting donor centres in doped semi - conductors : @xmath36 . in this model",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is proportional to the donor concentration @xmath38 .",
    "we find @xmath39 and @xmath40 , but uncertainty about the donor concentration prevents further analysis .",
    "we note that this approach has been used to explain the susceptibility of a zinc - blende gan thin film @xcite .",
    "the authors derive @xmath41 for which they estimate @xmath42 @xmath43 , in agreement with the experimental value attributed to nitrogen vacancies .    however , the susceptibility of gan is very sensitive to n vacancy concentration @xcite .",
    "there is some variation in the susceptibility of the gan capping layers associated with minor differences in stoichiometry resulting from the ion - assisted deposition process .",
    "nevertheless we are able to subtract the capping layer signal to reasonable accuracy , so the evidence of the remarkable magnetic behaviour of smn is not strongly affected by this uncertainty .",
    "below we present the data both uncorrected and after correction for the substrate / capping layer signals .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the temperature variation of the magnetisation of sample i in an applied field of @xmath44  t , after cooling in zero field ( zfc ) or in @xmath44  t ( fc ) .",
    "the curves are superimposed down to @xmath45  k , below which a sharp increase of the fc curve denotes ferromagnetic order with a spontaneous magnetic moment .",
    "the same behaviour has been confirmed in an applied field as low as @xmath46  mt . in the zfc curve the increase of the magnetisation below @xmath24  k is assigned to the gan cap layer .",
    "the transition temperature estimated from the maximum of the zfc curve is found at @xmath47  k. the other two films gave curie temperatures of @xmath48  k and @xmath49  k. we have not been able to relate these small differences to the films compositions or structures , so we quote @xmath50  k. note in this regard that it is known that n vacancies lower the curie temperature in gdn @xcite .",
    "our films are close to stoichiometric , but absolute measurements of the composition have an accuracy of about @xmath35 .",
    "it is notable that earlier heat capacity @xcite and magnetisation @xcite measurements suggested curie temperatures in the @xmath51  k range ; they were likely performed on n deficient samples .",
    "above @xmath0 the magnetisation @xmath52 is linear in field @xmath53 with a paramagnetic susceptibility that includes both curie - weiss and temperature - independent van  vleck contributions as will be discussed in the following section . at @xmath0 @xmath54 becomes nonlinear , and an hysteresis loop develops .",
    "the evolution of the loop as the temperature is lowered is shown in figure [ fig2 ] . here the left side [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a , b , c ) ] represents the loops uncorrected for gan while in the right side [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](d , e , f ) ] the correction is included .",
    "we first focus on the loops measured after cooling the films in zero field ( red full dots ) . at @xmath3  k [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] the saturation is achieved at @xmath55 t. beyond the irreversibility point , the magnetisation is linear in field , due to the paramagnetic contribution of gan .",
    "after correction for gan the loop exhibits a coercive field of @xmath17  t [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) ] . at @xmath28  k [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] the reversible part at high field is missing ; the closing field lies above the @xmath2  t maximum available .",
    "this behaviour is exactly as expected when the maximum applied field is insufficient to achieve the reversal of the moments , so that only minor loops are measured , signaling a magnetocrystalline anisotropy that grows at lower temperature @xcite . at @xmath46",
    "k the loop shows only a very small opening and at @xmath4  k [ fig .  [ fig2](c ) ] the hysteresis has completely disappeared , so that only the gan paramagnetic contribution is seen in the zfc data .",
    "clearly the magnetic field necessary to even initiate the reversal of ferromagnetic domains is higher than @xmath2  t at these temperatures , and the magnetisation process is dominated by the reversible paramagnetic contribution .",
    "hysteretic behaviour can nonetheless be confirmed at these temperatures by cooling in the presence of the maximum field of @xmath2  t to prepare the film in a magnetised state .",
    "thus figure [ fig2 ] compares the hysteresis patterns obtained at @xmath3  k , @xmath28  k and @xmath4  k after zero - field cooling ( red full dots ) and after cooling in @xmath2  t ( black open squares ) .",
    "the loops are superimposed at @xmath3  k [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a , d ) ] , but at the lower temperatures the patterns are shifted from one another [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b , e ) and fig .",
    "[ fig2](c , f ) ] .",
    "exactly the same behaviour is observed when cooling the system under @xmath56  t , though with the shifts found in the opposite sense .",
    "the results confirm that the coercive and saturation fields are larger than @xmath2  t at these temperatures .",
    "in addition a very small spontaneous moment is observed on the saturated loops ; the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment down to @xmath57  k is interesting to evaluate . at @xmath3",
    "k , @xmath58sm , compared to @xmath59sm at remanence when the field is reduced to zero . the difference is due in part to single - domain crystallites relaxing to an easy - axis magnetisation in the remanent state , leaving the moments distributed in a cone about the field direction .",
    "the easy axis in smn is as yet unknown , but if it lies along one of the high - symmetry directions @xmath60 , @xmath61 or @xmath62 , the field - parallel component of the moment is reduced by about @xmath63 , explaining about one half of the measured reduction from the saturation to the remanence .",
    "we conclude that the remnant moment provides a reasonable lower limit for the single - domain spontaneous magnetisation . to refine the estimate we have performed experiments in which the material is prepared in the magnetised state by cooling in @xmath2  t , followed by measurements of the magnetisation in a small field of @xmath24  mt . the resulting remnant magnetisation drops to zero at the curie temperature from a zero - temperature magnetisation of @xmath64sm averaged over the three films . assuming that this value represents somewhat less than @xmath65 of the spontaneous moment we quote that moment as @xmath66sm at the lowest temperature .",
    "such a small moment explains the null result in the early neutron search for ferromagnetic order @xcite , and is in agreement with the near cancellation of spin and orbital moments suggested by larson  _ et  al . _",
    "the saturation field is large , rising above our @xmath2  t maximum available field below @xmath3  k. it is important in this regard to note that the ferromagnetic state , with its very small moment , couples relatively weakly with the magnetic field .",
    "remarkably , the small moment found in the ferromagnetic phase is not carried across the transition , rather the paramagnetic behaviour of smn can be fully understood within the established description of sm in the crystalline environment .",
    "we start by recalling that the ground state configuration of the sm@xmath67 free ion is @xmath68 with @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the land factor is @xmath72 and the magnetic moment is @xmath73 .",
    "the first excited multiplet @xmath7 is not thermally populated , but a paramagnetic moment will partly arise from an admixture of the multiplets induced by the applied magnetic field . as usually observed in trivalent sm compounds , the reciprocal susceptibility is therefore not linear in temperature , preventing a curie - weiss - like analysis .    with the inclusion of the @xmath74 admixture in the @xmath8 ground state ,",
    "the paramagnetic susceptibility of sm@xmath67 compounds is reasonably well described by the van  vleck approach , with @xcite    @xmath75    the second term is the conventional curie - weiss susceptibility involving the effective magnetic moment @xmath76 for @xmath71 , with @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the sm ion density .",
    "the van  vleck term @xmath79 depends on the energy difference @xmath80  k between the two lowest @xmath81 multiplets @xcite :    @xmath82    we have used equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) to fit the measured paramagnetic susceptibility curves above @xmath0 as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ eq:1 ] for the magnetisation curve obtained under @xmath44  t. it can be seen that the free - ion van  vleck term , with no adjustable parameters , provides an excellent fit to the temperature - independent tail at high temperatures . the diverging contribution below @xmath83",
    "k yields a curie temperature @xmath84  k , in excellent agreement with the value of @xmath85  k where this film showed a cusp in the zfc magnetisation curve .",
    "similar agreement has been found also with the other two films , as can be seen on figure [ fig3 ] for sample _ ii _ .",
    "a sense of the relative strength of the contributions to the susceptibility can be obtained by comparing the van vleck term @xmath86 obtained from equation  [ eq:2 ] to the curie - weiss term @xmath87 .",
    "for example with @xmath88 , at 300 k @xmath89 and at 100 k @xmath90 .",
    "the effective magnetic moment derived from the curie constant @xmath91 for the three films is @xmath92 per sm ion , somewhat smaller than the free ion effective paramagnetic moment of @xmath93^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\mu_b = 0.845 \\mu_b$ ] , though still larger than the value of @xmath94 in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the paramagnetic moment is understood by noting that the @xmath71 level is decomposed by the cubic octahedral crystal field into a doublet @xmath95 and a quartet @xmath96 .",
    "specific heat data @xcite quoted in @xcite report that the @xmath95 sublevel is the ground state with a separation of @xmath97  k to the @xmath96 sublevel for the bonding configuration of smn .",
    "we can therefore assume that at @xmath45  k only the ground doublet is significantly populated and calculate an approximate value of the low temperature susceptibility .",
    "the @xmath95 kramers doublet @xcite can be described with the equivalent wave functions @xmath98 for a fictitious spin @xmath99 , for which we have calculated a land factor , @xmath100 , of @xmath101 .",
    "we obtain @xmath102^{\\frac{1}{2 } } = 0.41 \\mu_b$ ] , in good agreement with the experimental effective moment .",
    "it is important to note that these results establish quite clearly that the entire sm population in the films participates in the paramagnetic curie - weiss signal diverging at @xmath0 , emphasising that the full population also participates in the ferromagnetic order .",
    "the present work gives strong evidence for a ferromagnetic state in smn .",
    "the magnetic moment in the ferromagnetic phase is an order of magnitude smaller than in the paramagnetic state , confirming a nearly - zero - moment ferromagnet below @xmath103  k. the magnetic behaviour in the paramagnetic phase is in quantitative agreement with the expected moments of sm , showing the effects of both the excited spin - orbit state and the constraints imposed by the crystal field .",
    "the reduced ferromagnetic moment is established quite clearly by the experiments , but remains a theoretical challenge .",
    "the near - zero moment ferromagnetic state in a semiconductor has clear potential for various fundamental studies and devices involving control of spin- and charge - degrees of freedom without the perturbing effects of a fringe magnetic field . for device applications it would clearly be interesting to investigate the prospect of raising the curie temperature of this material , either by alloying or strain . however , there is also considerable possibility that specific high technology spintronics devices that run at @xmath104  k ( and even he temperature ) will be used in the future .",
