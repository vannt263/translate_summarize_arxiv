    "nowadays , the available bandwidth to transfer data has become one of the most important and costly communication resources due to increasing use of communication networks and significant exponential growth of the internet traffic load .",
    "considering the fact that internet video traffic has become the main part of all consumer internet traffic @xcite , using novel approaches such as caching seems to be of high significance in reducing bandwidth consumption .",
    "content delivery networks ( cdns ) are typical examples of enterprises using the caching techniques to deliver requested content to the consumers @xcite .",
    "simply put , in such methods the geographically distributed storage units cache content during network low - peak hours based on the statistics of demands , given their cache sizes .",
    "then , upon consumer requests arrival , this cached data will be used during network high - peak hours to relieve congestion . both _",
    "cache content placement _ and _ content delivery _ phases need careful design considerations to manage network congestion .",
    "employing the caching idea in communication networks has been the subject of many recent works .",

    "propose using cache - enabled _ helpers _ in cellular networks to offload traffic from congested base stations @xcite . in @xcite , the idea of device - to - device",
    "( d2d ) communication with distributed caching has been investigated .",
    "also , in @xcite and @xcite , the authors analyze the role of proactive edge caching in 5 g wireless networks .",
    "finally , the throughput - memory trade - off for cache - enabled ad - hoc networks has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the concept of _ coded caching _ introduced in @xcite considers the caching problem from an information theoretic perspective , resulting in substantial performance gains .",
    "subsequent works extended the results to the d2d setting @xcite , networks with hierarchical caches architecture @xcite , multi - server setup @xcite , cache - enabled interference channels @xcite , and miso broadcast channels with delayed csit @xcite , @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we consider an interference channel where both transmitters and receivers are equipped with cache memories of limited size . in the cache content placement phase ,",
    "the caches of both sides are filled with content from a library , without knowing the actual requests of the receivers . in the content delivery phase , by knowing the receivers requests , the transmitters send proper signals on the wireless medium to fulfill these demands .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , which considers the same setup with full csit , here we assume a mixed csit setting .",
    "in other words , in order to provide csi at the transmit side , the transmitters send training symbols at the beginning of each time coherence block .",
    "based on this training process , the csi is fed back to the transmitters , leading to delay in obtaining csit .",
    "this model is closer to practical scenarios where csit should be provided by some sort of feedback @xcite .    as shown in @xcite , with full csit assumption , increasing cache size at the transmitters or receivers results in higher dof .",
    "that is due to the fact that , by providing memory at the transmitters , they can cooperate in sending data , and the more the storage size is , the higher the cooperation chances will be . on the other hand ,",
    "receive - side memories provide multi - casting opportunities as discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the interesting result of @xcite emphasizes that the transmitter and receiver memories are of equal importance in terms of dof , when there is full csit . on the contrary , in this paper with the mixed csit model , we prove that the receive - side caches are much more valuable than the ones at transmit side .",
    "in fact , the cooperation of transmitters heavily relies on perfect instantaneous csit , which diminishes in practical mixed csit scenarios .",
    "the multi - casting opportunities provided by receive - side caches , however , are not sensitive to such information .",
    "this result has an important practical design guideline on storage allocation in interference channels : _ push the storage towards end - users_.    other closely related works to our study are @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the papers @xcite and @xcite also consider cache - enabled interference channels , with the difference that they assume memory only at the transmit side . in @xcite ,",
    "zhang et al . consider the effect of delayed csit in a miso boradcast channel , which is equivalent to having unlimited memory at the transmit side , similar to @xcite . here , in contrast , we consider limited transmit - side memory .",
    "finally , @xcite considers a wyner model , and that the transmitters are connected via a cloud ran , which makes their model different from ours .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : system_model ] , we present the system model . in section [ sec : perfectcsit ] ,",
    "dof of a cache - enabled interference channel with full csit is derived . in section [ sec : delayedcsit ] , we introduce dof of a cache - enabled interference channel with mixed csit . finally , section [ sec : num ] presents numerical illustrations , and concludes the paper .",
    "* notation : * @xmath0 represents transpose operation .",
    "@xmath1 denotes the cardinality of a set , and @xmath2\\triangleq\\{1,2, ... ,k\\}$ ] , for any @xmath3 .",
    "we consider a block time - varying memoryless wireless interference channel through which @xmath4 transmitters are connected to @xmath5 receivers .",
    "such channel , at each time instant @xmath6 , can be modeled as a @xmath5-by-@xmath4 matrix which is denoted by @xmath7 \\in \\mathbb{c}^{k_r\\times k_t}$ ] , whose entry in the @xmath8th row and the @xmath9th column represents the channel gain from transmitter @xmath9 to the @xmath8th receiver , and is an independent complex gaussian random variable @xmath10 .",
    "this matrix relates the channel s inputs to the outputs by following equation : @xmath11 in which , @xmath12 is the vector consisting of all the transmitted messages , @xmath13 represents the output vector which includes the received signals , and @xmath14 denotes the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with the covariance matrix @xmath15 .",
    "then , we define the channel gain vector to the @xmath16th receiver as follows : @xmath17 which is the transpose of the @xmath16th row of matrix @xmath18 , so the received signal of receiver @xmath16 based on the channel s input vector is as follows : @xmath19    we divide the time domain into time slots of equal length , @xmath20 , such that the channel state during each time slot is fixed , while it is completely independent for different time slots . in other words , the channel transfer matrix elements do not alter in the middle of any time slot , so a discrete - time process , i.e. @xmath21={\\bf h}(\\tau|(m-1)t_c\\le \\tau < mt_c)$ ] , represents channel transfer matrix for all time slots @xmath22 .    in this paper , we assume that the csi is measured at the receivers from training symbols sent by the transmitters . then , via a feedback channel",
    ", this information is fed back to the transmitters .",
    "we assume this training / feedback procedure takes the time of length @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , in the first @xmath23 seconds of each time coherence block of @xmath20 seconds , the transmitters do not have any instantaneous csi , while in the rest of the coherence time they possess full csi , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we define @xmath24 , as a measure for channel training efficiency , with @xmath25 denoting full csit , and @xmath26 representing delayed csit .",
    "this model is called _ mixed csit _ in the literature @xcite .",
    "we consider a library of @xmath27 files , @xmath28 , of size @xmath29 bits each .",
    "we also assume that each transmitter has a cache of size @xmath30 bits , and each receiver is equipped with a cache of size @xmath31 bits . for later use ,",
    "we define parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we , further , suppose that aggregate cache size of the transmitters is greater than the total size of all the @xmath27 files in the library , so the condition @xmath34 should be satisfied .",
    "the network operates in two phases , namely _ cache content placement _ and _ content delivery_. in the former , the cache of transmitters and receivers are filled with data from the library , without prior knowledge of receivers actual requests . in the latter ,",
    "each receiver requests a single file from the library , where file @xmath35 is demanded by @xmath16th receiver .",
    "then , accordingly , the transmitters cooperate to send proper data such that each receiver is able to retrieve its demanded file using the received data and the content stored in its cache .    in this paper , as the performance metric , we use degrees of freedom ( dof ) as a measure of the number of non - interfering parallel paths which can be used to deliver different data streams simultaneously ( or equivalently in our case the number of users being served at the same time ) , defined as follows .    for an interference channel consisting of @xmath4 transmitters , each with a cache of size @xmath30 bits , and @xmath5 receivers , each with a cache of size @xmath31 bits ,",
    "the optimum dof is defined as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the supremum of all achievable sum - rates received by all the receivers for normalized cache sizes of @xmath38 and @xmath39 on transmit and receive sides respectively , as well as a power constraint of @xmath40 held for transmitter antennas .    according to this definition",
    ", the value of dof can not be greater than the number of all receivers in the system ( @xmath5 ) .",
    ".33       .33       .33    in this section , we derive dof when full csit is available .",
    "first , we consider the special case of @xmath41 , which is stated in lemma [ lem:1 ] .",
    "then , the main result of this section for general @xmath42 is presented in theorem [ thm:0 ] .",
    "[ lem:1 ] suppose an interference channel with a transfer matrix of i.i.d .",

    "the main point of lemma [ lem:1 ] is that each transmitter has access to the full library as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2a ] .",
    "next , in theorem [ thm:0 ] , we generalize lemma [ lem:1 ] to the case where transmitters have limited memories , such that no transmitter is able to cache the entire library .",
    "[ thm:0 ] suppose an interference channel with a transfer matrix of i.i.d .",

    "first , we divide each file into @xmath48 equal - sized non - overlapping sub - files : @xmath49,|{\\cal t}| = t_t,\\nonumber\\\\      & & { \\cal r } \\subseteq [ k_r ] , |{\\cal r}| = t_r ) .",

    "it can be seen that @xmath57 , |{\\cal r}| = t_r)$ ] is present in the caches of exactly @xmath38 transmitters , i.e. the ones which belong to @xmath58 .",
    "so , we can divide the primary library @xmath59 into @xmath60 sub - libraries as follows : @xmath61,|{\\cal t}|=t_t,\\ ] ] each of which is completely cached in precisely @xmath38 transmitters , and also is comprised of @xmath27 smaller files each of size @xmath62 bits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] ) .",
    "let us consider one of these sub - libraries , say @xmath63 .",
    "we define sub - problem @xmath64 to be the problem of delivering @xmath65 by @xmath38 transmitters ( members of @xmath66 ) all having access to the whole sub - library @xmath63 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2c ] .",
    "consequently , if the necessary transmissions of all sub - problems @xmath67 are fulfilled in sequence , each receiver @xmath16 will be able to decode @xmath35 .",
    "this reduces the original problem to @xmath68 multi - server problems with smaller sub - libraries .",
    "then , the result of lemma [ lem:1 ] can be applied with @xmath38 transmitters to each sub - problem , which states that , for each @xmath66 , the delivery of @xmath65 can be accomplished with a dof of    @xmath69    since sub - problems are handled in sequence , the same dof is achievable for the whole library , and this concludes the proof .    it should be noted that a similar result , for the full csit case , has also been obtained independently in @xcite , via a different proof approach without relying on lemma [ lem:1 ] . since , in the next section , we need more details of the delivery scheme , we have provided the delivery details in the .",
    "the interesting result of @xcite shows that delayed csit can still be of much benefit in order to achieve greater dof than the one without csit . considering a miso broadcast channel in which transmitters access channel coefficients of all preceding time slots excluding the present time slot , the authors in @xcite propose a novel method which employs such past knowledge to achieve an optimum dof of the channel .",
    "we will state the main theorem of the aforementioned work in the following lemma .",
    "[ lem:2 ] for a miso broadcast channel with @xmath70 transmit antennas , @xmath71 receivers , and one - time - slot - delayed csit , for @xmath72 we have : @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the maximum dof to transfer messages of order @xmath9 ( messages which are intended for exactly @xmath9 receivers ) .    based on lemma [ lem:2 ] ,",
    "we can state the following result for the delayed csit cache - enabled interference channel .",
    "[ corol:1 ] _ in a cache - enabled @xmath75 interference channel with delayed csit the following dofs ( and their lower convex envelope ) are achievable : @xmath76 where @xmath47 and @xmath45 , and @xmath77 should be held true .",
    "_    choosing a @xmath38-subset of transmitters , @xmath58 , and a subset of receivers of cardinality @xmath78 , @xmath79 , according to the procedure introduced in , results in a pair @xmath80 such that messages of order @xmath81 ( each beneficial to a @xmath82-subset of @xmath79 ) can be generated using the content which is present in the caches of transmitters in @xmath58 . drawing the analogy between the aforementioned set - up and the one in lemma [ lem:2 ] , we observe that dof order @xmath81 can be calculated from above lemma substituting @xmath81 , @xmath38 , and @xmath78 for @xmath9 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 respectively : @xmath83 thus , the procedure described in algorithm [ alg:1 ] results in the desired dof .",
    "@xmath84 + @xmath85 + @xmath86 +     +    now , we proceed to state the main theorem that introduces the achievable dof which can be attained in case that transmitters experience a feedback channel resulting in mixed csit .",
    "[ thm:1 ] for an interference channel comprising @xmath4 transmitters and @xmath5 receivers , each transmitter with a cache of size @xmath30 bits and each receiver equipped with a @xmath31-bit memory , and a library including @xmath27 files each of size @xmath29 bits , if the state of csit availability is characterized by a factor @xmath87 , the following dof is achievable : @xmath88 where @xmath47 , @xmath45 , and @xmath77 should be held true .",
    "availability of mixed csit characterized by the parameter @xmath89 shows that during @xmath89 portion of time , transmitters access csit with a delay of one time slot , and have current csit for the rest of time .",
    "thus , in each time coherence block @xmath20 , during the training phase algorithm [ alg:1 ] is used for delivery , and , in the remaining period algorithm [ alg:2 ] is used .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the total dof equals the linear combination of the ones in theorem [ thm:0 ] and corollary [ corol:1 ] with coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath89 respectively , which leads to .",
    "in this section , we examine the result of theorem [ thm:1 ] in order to gain an insight into how each of parameters which describe the system model contributes to the achievable dof in . to this end",
    ", we consider two main parameters of the system and investigate the interaction of achievable dof and these parameters .",
    "the first one is the portion of each time block during which perfect csit is not available denoted by @xmath89 as we previously defined .",
    "the latter one is the portion of all cache size allocated to the receivers to the total cache size in the transmit side , which we denote by @xmath91 .",
    "[ fig:3 ] represents the impact of @xmath89 on the achievable dof in . as shown in the diagram",
    ", we can see that the dof is inversely related to @xmath89 in a linear manner , for fixed cache sizes at both transmit and receive sides . for a fixed @xmath92 ,",
    "it also can be figured out that increasing total cache size of system not only leads to a greater dof , but also steepens the slope of the diagram of dof versus @xmath89 , which means that the more the system aggregate cache size is , the more the influence of full csit on enhancing dof will be .",
    "also , the effect of @xmath92 on dof is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "this figure indicates how the caches at receive side can be more beneficial in practical conditions than the caches at transmit side . in this figure , we assume a fixed normalized total cache size @xmath93 .",
    "the case @xmath25 refers to the setup in @xcite which indicates equal value for allocating memory at either transmit or receive side for the current csit case . for @xmath94 , i.e. mixed csit case , by increasing @xmath92 ( allocating more storage to the receive side ) , dof will increase .",
    "therefore , considering an interference channel with caches at both transmit and receive sides , the present study demonstrated that equipping receivers with caches benefits content delivery phase in terms of dof more than doing so for transmitters when a more practical scenario is encountered .",
    "in particular , we assumed a pragmatic approach of providing csit including a training / feedback process , leading to a combination of current and delayed csit availability , namely mixed csit .",
    "we introduced an achievable dof in such setting that accentuates the superiority of receive - side caches over transmitters memories for lower qualities of feedback .",
