    "the importance of narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1 ) became apparent on the discovery of the ` primary eigenvector ' ( pc1 ; eigenvector 1 ) in the boroson & green ( 1992 ) principle component analysis of pg quasars .",
    "pc1 showed a strong anticorrelation between the strengths of  and  in the optical spectra , with nls1 as a class showing the strongest  emission and weakest . while the physical driver of pc1 is still debated , there are strong indications that the fraction of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath3 ) at which the object is emitting at is responsible , implying that nls1 are relatively high accretion rate systems .",
    "since there are no significant differences between nls1 and broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( bls1 ) in their x - ray , optical , or bolometric luminosities ( grupe 2004 ) , it naturally follows from the condition of higher accretion rates that nls1 possess a lower mass black hole compared to bls1 of similar luminosity .",
    "black hole mass measurements confirm lower mass black holes in nls1 ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ; peterson 2000 ; grupe & mathur 2004 ) .",
    "the strong  emission in nls1 is prevalent in the uv ( e.g. laor 1997 ; constantin & shields 2003 ) , optical ( e.g. boroson & green 1992 ) , and infrared ( e.g. rodriguez - ardila 2002 ) .",
    "the observed line widths and absence of forbidden emission suggests that  is formed in the dense blr , but photoionisation models can not account for all of the  emission .",
    "the `  discrepancy ' remains unsolved , though models which consider non - radiative heating ( probably due to shocks produced in outflows ) , with an overabundance of iron are promising ( see collin & joly 2000 for a review ) .",
    "perhaps the most interesting characteristics of nls1 are manifested in the x - ray regime .",
    "the origin of the strong soft excess emission below about @xmath4 , known since  observations ( e.g. puchnarewicz 1992 ; see also boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) , is still debated ( e.g. mineshige 2000 ; gierlinski & done 2004 ; crummy 2005 ) ; as is the nature of the extreme , rapid variability . with , came the discovery that the @xmath5 spectrum in nls1 also appeared steeper than in bls1 ( brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 ) .",
    "the result could be understood as arising from significant compton cooling of the accretion disc corona due to the strong soft x - ray excess found in most nls1 .",
    "the lower energy gain per scattering ( smaller compton @xmath6 parameter ) would yield steeper , hard x - ray slopes .    with the high - sensitivity of  came what may be the most interesting discovery with regards to nls1 , and that was the presence of a sharp , spectral drop at @xmath7 in h  ( boller 2002 ) .",
    "since then , a number of drops at @xmath8 ( or more generally ` high - energy curvature ' ) have been observed in several nls1 ( e.g. pounds 2003 , 2004 ; longinotti 2003 ; boller 2003 ; uttley 2004 ; reeves 2004 ) .",
    "the exact nature of this behaviour , which seems to be a characteristic of nls1 , is uncertain .",
    "two models which appear probable are partial - covering ( e.g. tanaka 2004 and references within ) and reflection ( e.g. fabian 2002 ) .    in terms of partial - covering ,",
    "the @xmath9 drop is produced by absorption of the continuum emission by a dense material , which only partly obscures the primary emitter .",
    "this can , in principle , explain the absence of other absorption features ( e.g. intrinsic cold absorption , fe  l absorption , fluorescence emission ) , and if the absorber is allowed to be in radial motion , it can possibly account for the various edge energies which are seen ( e.g. gallo 2004a ) .",
    "it is important to realise that partial - covering does not describe the nature of the primary continuum source .",
    "although a simple blackbody plus power law continuum is often assumed , other physical descriptions of the primary continuum are not dismissed , nor do they discriminate against partial - covering .",
    "reflection of the power law continuum source off the cold accretion disc can also adequately describe the x - ray spectra of nls1 ( e.g. fabian 2004 ) . in this case , the sharp drop at high energies is the blue wing of a relativistically broadened iron line . in combination with light bending effects close to the black hole ( e.g. miniutti & fabian 2004 ) ,",
    "the reflection model nicely describes the shape of the x - ray continuum and the principle of ` reflection dominated ' spectra .",
    "it stands to reason that regardless of the correct model , the process may be ubiquitous in nls1 and probably in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . by varying the prevalence of the physical process",
    "( e.g. the degree of absorption or amount of reflection ) one can potentially describe the different types of x - ray spectra that are observed .",
    "objects , such as 13224  or h , manifest ` the process ' significantly ; thus exhibiting sharp and deep spectral drops .",
    "other nls1 , like ngc  4051 , demonstrate the process only moderately , only displaying gentle curvature over the hard x - ray band . in most other nls1 ,",
    "the process is minimal and likely not detected .    in this work",
    "we examine what , if anything , is unique about the nls1 which appear to possess high - energy complexity .",
    "leighly & moore ( 2004 ) began to address this issue when they examined how the uv properties of 13224  and h  were remarkable compared to other nls1 . they found that 13224  and h  possessed weaker emission lines , significant asymmetry in the c  iv profile and steeper spectra .",
    "they concluded that many of the differences in the two nls1 could be explained in terms of radiative line driven wind models ( e.g. proga , stone & kallman 2000 ; leighly 2004 ) .",
    "here , we continue to probe this issue by investigating multiwavelength properties of a sample of nls1 , which includes a larger number of ` extreme ' objects .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we define a complex sample of nls1 , which appear to exhibit high - energy complexity in their  ( jansen 2001 ) spectra ; and a general sample of nls1 , which do not show significant evidence of the complexity described here .",
    "in addition , the x - ray data processing is described .",
    "the dependence of x - ray flux state in defining the samples is investigated in section  3 . in section  4 , the calculation of the optical - to - x - ray spectral index from contemporaneous uv and x - ray data are described and presented . in section  5",
    "the multiwavelength parameters obtained from the literature ( or estimated by us ) are compared and our findings are highlighted .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ sect : disc ] and give our summary in section  [ sect : conc ] .",

    "finally , if more than one observation of the same object was available , the highest sn data were used .",
    "this filtering process resulted in the sample of 28 nls1 , which possess high - quality , intrinsic @xmath5 spectra ( table  [ tab : xmm ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this study is to focus on the nature of nls1 which exhibit complexity in their intrinsic @xmath25 spectra . to identify these objects , each spectra above @xmath26 ( rest - frame ) was fitted with a baseline model composing of a power law modified by galactic absorption ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) plus , if necessary , an unresolved ( @xmath27 ) gaussian profile between @xmath28 .",
    "the intention of this baseline model was not to determine the ` best - fit ' to the spectrum , but to identify the objects which , to first order , could not be explained by the most basic agn model .",
    "sources for which the null hypothesis of this baseline model was @xmath29 were marked as nls1 with high - energy complexity .",
    "we purposely adopted a low value for the null hypothesis to identify the most extreme cases which , in turn , should make it easier to identify other extreme characteristic of the sample .",
    "six nls1 ( pg  1211 + 143 , 13224 , h , 1535 , pg  1402 + 261 and 4051 ) were categorised as having high - energy complexity .",

    ", the filled circles will mark the members of the c - sample and the open squares will identify the s - sample population .",
    "the distribution of sn is comparable for the c- and s - sample .",
    "therefore , even though identifying x - ray spectral complexity obviously depends on sn , it does not appear that it will be a significant bias in selecting our sample .",
    "for illustrative purposes the pn data for  during revolution 302 are also included ( blue star ) .",
    "we chose to include  as it is perhaps the most obvious display of high - energy spectral complexity in a type 1 agn .",
    "we considered what effect x - ray variability could have on the sample definition by examining the historic @xmath5 light curve for each object . specifically , we compared the  x - ray fluxes measured for each object with past measurements from other missions .",
    "fluxes were available either from vaughan ( 1999 ) or the tartarus archive for ten of the objects in the s - sample .",
    "five objects also had  measurements ( comastri 2000 ) resulting in an x - ray flux measurement for eleven nls1 in the s - sample ( four having  and  measurements ) .",
    "we found that for ten of them the flux varied by less than 50 per cent , although more typically on the @xmath32 per cent level .",
    "this degree of variability is not abnormal for nls1 on hourly time scales ; therefore it seems that most members of the s - sample are in a typical flux state ( of course , this is based on limited observations ) . the  flux of iras  13349 + 2438 diminished by more than @xmath33 per cent since the two  observations . during the  observation , iras  13349",
    "+ 2438 was another @xmath33 per cent dimmer then during the  pointing . due to our strict criteria , iras  13349 + 2438",
    "has not been included in our c - sample , but it does appear to possess some high - energy complexity ( longinotti 2003 ) . it could be that in even lower flux states , such as that observed with , the spectrum would appear even more complicated .    for three members of the c - sample ,",
    "h , ngc  4051 and pg  1211 + 143 , it can be established from long - term , multi - mission light curves that the objects were in low - flux states during the  observations ( see leighly ( 2002 ) for h , uttley ( 2003 , 2004 ) for ngc  4051 , and yaqoob ( 1994 ) for pg  1211 + 143 ) .",
    "similarly , from a 10-day long  observation ( dewangan 2000 ) and comparison with the  observation ( comastri 2000 ) it can be shown that iras  132243809 was also in an x - ray low - flux state during the  observation .",
    "data are sparse for pg  1535 + 547 , pg  1402 + 261 and phl  1092 . compared only to the  fluxes ,",
    "the  flux for pg  1535 + 547 was comparable while for pg  1402 + 261 it was @xmath34 per cent lower .",
    "for phl  1092 the  flux was about @xmath35 per cent lower than during the observation .",
    "it is difficult to determine if this indicates a low - flux state for phl  1092 .",
    "variations of this order are typical on hourly time scales in the @xmath36 range ( brandt 1999 ; gallo 2004b ) ; however the @xmath5 variability is found to be negligible over similar time scales ( gallo 2004b ) .",
    "if not convincing , it appears rather suggestive that the s- and c - samples defined in this work are , by coincidence , representative of nls1 in x - ray typical- and low - flux states , respectively .",
    "therefore , it also follows that objects could transit from one sample to another depending on their x - ray flux state .",
    "an advantage afforded with  is the availability of optical and uv data obtained with the optical monitor ( om ; mason 2001 ) simultaneously with x - ray observations . for many of the nls1 observations ,",
    "om imaging data were also collected at uv or optical wavelengths .",
    "therefore , whenever possible , we determined rest - frame @xmath37 luminosities and optical - to - x - ray spectral indices ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the standard definition of @xmath1 is : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the intrinsic flux densities at @xmath14 and @xmath37 , respectively ; and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the corresponding frequencies . in many of the observations the rest - frame @xmath37 was directly observed within one of the om broad - band filters .",
    "consequently , the flux density at @xmath37 was estimated from the source count rate in that filter ( chen 2004 ) .",
    "however , when this was not the case it was necessary to extrapolate from some measured uv wavelength ( @xmath43 ) to @xmath37 .",
    "the modified expression for @xmath1 is then : @xmath44 where the second term on the right - hand side is the spectral slope between the measured uv flux density at @xmath43 and @xmath37 .",
    "if measured by constantin & shields ( 2003 ) , the source - specific value for the uv spectral slope was used ( the value shown in table  [ tab : samp ] ) .",
    "if the source - specific value was not known we adopted the spectral slope of the composite sdss quasar spectrum between @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ; vanden berk 2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath37 flux density was measured from the available pre - processed pipeline products for each source . for most observations ,",
    "multiple images were taken in the same filter , in which case the average source count rate was used to estimate the flux densities ( chen 2004 ) . for mrk  1044 ,",
    "mrk  896 and mrk  493 , images were only made in the @xmath47-band ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "for these observations an extrapolation to @xmath37 was not done given that the optical spectra of agn show a break in the continuum slope at about these wavelengths , which would introduce systematic uncertainties in the measurements of these three nls1 .",
    "host - galaxy contribution was not excluded ; thus will introduce a level of uncertainty in the reported values .",
    "in addition , fwhm ( ) and /  ratios were collected from the literature for as many objects as possible .",
    "these are also included in table  [ tab : samp ] .",
    "in order to probe the multiwavelength behaviour of these nls1 we collected various parameters from the literature such as : radio loudness , optical emission line strengths , c  iv strength , black hole mass and eddington luminosity ratios . comparing the two samples in all parameter spaces possible with these data reveled no clear difference between the c- and s - sample ; thus these parameters will not be considered further .",
    "measurements of @xmath1 from simultaneous uv and x - ray data clearly demonstrate a difference in the slope of the optical - x - ray continuum in the two samples ( figure  [ fig : aox ] ) .",
    "the average index for the s - sample is @xmath49 compared to @xmath50 for the c - sample .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test comparing the two distributions yields a probability of @xmath51 per cent that they are drawn from the same sample .    in figure",
    "[ fig : aox ] we have plotted @xmath1 as a function of @xmath37 monochromatic luminosity . for comparison , the uv luminosity dependence of @xmath1 for radio - quiet , type 1 agn ( @xmath52 ) is also shown ( strateva 2005 ) .",
    "the s - sample appears to follow this relationship relatively well , but most of the c - sample fall below the strateva relation . in combination with the fact that the c - sample objects are in x - ray low - flux states ( section  3 ) this clearly demonstrates x - ray weakness in these complex objects during the observations .    for five nls1 in the overall sample ,",
    "at least two x - ray observations with contemporaneous om data are available .",
    "three of these objects ( ton  s180 , mrk  478 , akn  564 ) are from the s - sample , the other two ( h , ngc  4051 ) are from the c - sample .",
    "the epoch - specific @xmath1 and @xmath53 were calculated for each of these observations .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig : aox ] as crosses . for the objects in the s - sample , the fluctuations in @xmath1 are small and perhaps even negligible if a complete error analysis was considered .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1 variations are much more significant for the two objects in the c - sample ( h  and ngc  4051 ) . figure  [ fig : aox ] also indicates that the variations in @xmath1 are driven by changes in the x - ray flux , but that the uv flux also changes .",
    "for example , during the second observation h  was about six times brighter in the x - rays , while its uv flux diminished by @xmath54 per cent .",
    "increasing x - ray flux and decreasing uv flux was also seen in ngc  4051 .",
    "we also note that in the second observations of h  and ngc  4051 , both objects portray simpler high - energy spectra .",
    "that is , the null hypothesis for a power law plus gaussian fit for h  and ngc  4051 at these epochs was 0.176 and 0.456 , respectively . by our definition , neither object would have been considered ` complex ' at those times , suggesting that when measured in `` typical '' flux states , these source also follow the strateva relation .      in figure",
    "[ fig : feii ] , the /  ratio is plotted against the fwhm ( ) . the average ratio for the s - sample is @xmath55 with modest scatter as indicated by the reported standard deviation .",
    "the average of the c - sample is @xmath56 with considerable more scatter .",
    "the two samples clearly overlap . from a ks - test",
    "it is determined that the probability that they are drawn from the same sample is 8 per cent . although not highly significant there are indications that the strongest emitters are the ones that also display high - energy spectral complexity .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : aox ] , objects that possess complexity in their @xmath0 spectrum appear to be x - ray weaker ( i.e. they are found below the average @xmath57 relation ) . at least in two of the objects",
    "( ngc  4051 and h ) for which multiple , simultaneous , x - ray / uv observations are available , extreme epoch - to - epoch changes are seen in @xmath1 , demonstrating that when the spectrum appears less complex , x - ray emission is stronger and @xmath1 is more typical .",
    "the transiting of objects from the c- to the s - sample with increasing flux is predicted by both partial - covering and reflection models . in terms of partial - covering the increased spectral complexity during the low - flux states",
    "occurs because the intrinsic spectrum ( presumably a blackbody plus power law ) is highly absorbed , imposing edges and curvature in the detected spectrum . for reflection , the low - flux spectrum will likely be reflection dominated and the spectral curvature and drops will be associated with various reflection components ( predominately the blurred iron line and soft excess ; e.g. ross & fabian 2005 ) .",
    "the x - ray weakness is , of course , in agreement with absorption models such as partial - covering where the x - ray emitting region is more absorbed than the uv region .",
    "this could occur , for example , if the absorber is located somewhere between the x - ray and uv emitting regions of the accretion disc .",
    "consequently , uv fluctuations could arise from e.g. changes in the accretion rate , while the x - rays variations will appear larger because of the addition affect of the changing absorption .",
    "therefore the extreme changes in the x - ray flux due to absorption can drive the fluctuations in @xmath1 when compared to the relatively unabsorbed and less variable uv flux .",
    "we also note that in the multi - epoch observations of h  and ngc  4051 the uv flux diminished when the x - ray flux was higher .",
    "a prediction of the partial - covering model ( e.g. tanaka 2004 ) is that changes in the covering fraction or column density of the absorber(s ) will account for , at least , the long - term spectral variations ; but that the unabsorbed , intrinsic flux will remain relatively constant over time .",
    "we can test this prediction by reexamining the two  observations of h  ( gallo 2004a ) . during both observations ,",
    "the absorbed component of the intrinsic spectrum was seen through a column density of @xmath58 ; however during the first , low - flux state observation the covering fraction of the absorber was much greater .",
    "the intrinsic , @xmath14 flux density during the first and second observation of h  was @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "this yields @xmath61 at @xmath62 epochs , demonstrating that a common intrinsic flux modified by partial obscuration is possible in accounting for the differences in brightness over time .",
    "steep and fluctuating @xmath1 is not inconsistent with models , such as light bending ( e.g. miniutti & fabian 2004 ) , which incorporate general relativistic effects close to the black hole to account for some of the x - ray variability . in these models the low - flux , reflection dominated spectrum results when most of the emission from the primary , power law component is bent back toward the black hole and never reaches the observer . in comparison with the relatively constant uv emission ( most likely produced by the colder accretion disc )",
    "@xmath1 will be smaller ( x - ray weaker ) . as the emission from the power law continuum becomes important",
    ", the x - ray source becomes brighter and @xmath1 begins to flatten .",
    "not all of the nls1 in the c - sample possess strong optical  emission ( specifically / ) , but it does appear that the most extreme  emitters ( e.g. /@xmath63 ; 13224 , h , phl  1092 ) are spectrally complex .",
    "firm conclusions can not be drawn due to the small number statistics , but this raises the possible conjecture that not all object which display complex x - ray spectra possess strong iron emission , but possibly all objects with extreme  emission do possess the mechanism to create high - energy complexities .",
    "a simple test would be to make x - ray observations of a few extreme  emitters , say with /@xmath63 , as suggested by figure  [ fig : feii ] , and determine if their high - energy spectra are complex .",
    "however , the fact that a source can transit from one sample to another depending on its x - ray flux state ( section  3 ) raises further issues and limits the conclusions we can make regarding  emission .",
    "the primary issue is whether the  emission is variable and if it depends on the x - ray continuum flux .",
    "there are several studies which show evidence for ( e.g. kollatschny & fricke 1985 ; kollatschny 2000 ; vestergaard & peterson 2005 ; wang , wei & he 2005 ) and against ( goad 1999 ; kollatschny & welsh 2001 ) significant  variability . since the  measurements presented here are not contemporaneous with the x - ray measurements , we can only speculate on a possible connection between  strength and x - ray spectral complexity .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the strongest  emitters simply show the greatest variability .",
    "if so , this makes it more likely to catch the strongest  emitters in an extreme ( low ) flux state , as opposed to an average nls1 .",
    "13224 , h  and  are certainly know for there strong emission and significant variability . from the current analysis it is difficult to distinguish the two theory .",
    "we have investigated the nature of nls1 which exhibit complexity in their high - energy ( @xmath0 ) spectrum .",
    "we identified seven out of twenty - eight nls1 whose high - energy spectrum show significant deviations from a simple power law .",
    "we compared multiwavelength properties of this complex sample of seven nls1 with the larger sample to investigate whether we could identify any underlying physical processes that could be responsible for the spectral complexity .",
    "the main results follow .    * considering long - term x - ray variability of the sources , the complex sample of nls1 ( c - sample ) seems representative of objects in x - ray low - flux states , whereas the nls1 in the general sample ( s - sample ) appear to be in a typical flux state . * in cases where multi - epoch measurements of @xmath1 were possible , it appeared that @xmath1 approached more typical values as the complexity in the high - energy spectrum diminished . for h  and ngc  4051 ( both in the complex sample ) the variations in @xmath1 were extreme and while predominately due to variability in the x - rays , the uv flux did also change .",
    "specifically , in these two objects , the uv flux actually diminished when the x - ray flux was high and the spectral complexity less prominent .",
    "this is not inconsistent with either partial - covering or reflection scenarios . *",
    "on average , the c - sample showed stronger  emission ( / ) than the general sample .",
    "specifically , the three most extreme  emitters ( with /@xmath2 ) of the twenty - eight nls1 , were all part of the c - sample of only seven .",
    "this raises an intriguing possibility that we may be able to identify complicated x - ray nls1 based on the strength of the optical  emission .",
    "it is not certain from this current analysis if the possible connection between x - ray spectral complexity and  strength is due to high iron abundances or because strong  emitters may exhibit greater x - ray variations and consequently are more likely to be caught in an extreme ( low ) flux state .",
    "both absorption and reflection models predict the observed behaviour in @xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case of h  a common , intrinsic @xmath1 is predicted by the partial - covering model and is consistent with the  observations .",
    "partial - covering models make no strong assumption on the nature of the intrinsic spectrum , only that it is partly obscured . in this",
    "sense reflection models , which can describe the broad - band x - ray properties are attractive . while it seems obvious that reflection close to the black hole should occur it also seems premature to abandon concepts which employ absorption in the black hole environment to explain some of the x - ray behaviour .",
