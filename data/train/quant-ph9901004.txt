    "in contrast to the ensemble description based on master equations , quantum trajectories make available further information about details which are lost by ensemble averaging . the study of quantum trajectories of open systems @xcite@xcite has therefore found broad application in various fields to analyze fundamental processes .",
    "it is important to distinguish the quantum trajectories in hilbert space from the feynman paths @xcite : whereas the latter are defined in the underlying classical phase space and contribute with a complex probability amplitude to the path integral , the hilbert space quantum trajectories contribute with a real and positive probability to the ensemble density matrix @xcite .",
    "+ hence in the feynman path integral formulation the classical limit can be obtained in a direct way when the interferences between the paths basically reduce to the classical path .",
    "in contrast the hilbert space does not have a direct classical analogue . here , we define a hilbert space - trajectory as  classical \" , if it is constrained to orthogonal states . the jumps in the hilbert space imply jumps in observable space like energy or angular momentum : the orthogonal states can then be interpreted as the eigenstates of some observable ; its spectrum will here taken to be discrete and finite (  telegraph signal \" ) .",
    "while the non - classicality of states has attracted much interest recently @xcite , the non - classicality of the dynamical evolution , in particular on the level of trajectories , has received little if any attention so far .",
    "it is tempting to expect that an increasing dissipative interaction with the classical environment should make the trajectories more and more  classical \" .",
    "one may wonder , however , to what extent this expectation can be verified quantitatively .",
    "one may also wonder whether there is a relationship between non - classicality of states and of trajectories .    in this paper",
    "we introduce statistical distribution functions to account for the non - classicality of quantum trajectories , show their properties and their relation to the non - classicality of states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ cluster - operators ] we define a convenient operator set for the description of quantum networks , the states of which will be discussed in section [ quantum_states ] . the unraveling of the linblad master equation into single quantum trajectories is summarized in section [ stochastic_unraveling ] . in section [ measures_of_state_distance ]",
    "we discuss some properties of the measure of state distance , which are applied to the quantum trajectories in section [ state - distance_distributions_and_entanglement ] and [ co - jumps ] .",
    "the concept of jump- and co - jump - distances is exemplified in section [ co - jump_properties_of_model_states ] for special two- , three- and four - particle states . in section [ jump_statistics_of_simulated_trajectories ]",
    "we present numerical results exploiting this jump - concept for simulated trajectories .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary .",
    "we consider a network consisting of @xmath0 subsystems of @xmath1 states each .",
    "the local states are @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , allowing to introduce the transition - operators @xmath5 .",

    "is then given by the @xmath10 product - operators : here we will restrict ourselves to @xmath11 , @xmath7 , in which case we have @xcite @xmath12 the number @xmath13 of indices unequal zero is the number of subsystems this operator acts on .",
    "there are @xmath14 such @xmath13-cluster - operators , with @xmath15 .",
    "operators @xmath16 acting on different subsystems commute .",
    "any network - operator in a given liouville space @xmath17 can be expressed in terms of such cluster operators : in particular , for the density - operator @xmath18 one finds ( again for @xmath11 , @xmath7 , cf .",

    "+ these expectation - values @xmath21 uniquely specify the state ; they decompose into @xmath22 @xmath13-point correlation functions .",

    "the @xmath13=1-terms are the ( local ) bloch - vectors , @xmath24 , @xmath25 etc . , which can be found from local ( ensemble-)measurements .",
    "the @xmath26-terms are typically inferred from coincidence - measurements ( ensemble measurements ) .",
    "one easily convinces oneself that these correlation functions @xmath27 factorize if and only if the state @xmath18 exhibits some product form : for example , if @xmath28 , then @xmath29 or if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 subsystems and groups of subsystems which do _ not _ factor are called  entangled \" ( @xmath18 of the total system is taken to be pure and to describe a single network ) . without any entanglement , all @xmath13-point correlation functions are thus reducible to local expectation values ( i.e.  of type @xmath32 ) .",

    "these @xmath63-functions can be used instead of the  entropies of entanglement \" ( = entropy of the respective reduced density operators ) @xcite ; the @xmath64-terms are easier to calculate and , furthermore , can be made basis of approximation schemes ( see below ) .",

    "the probability for a quantum jump of type @xmath68 after the time interval @xmath69 is given by @xmath70    we suppose that these projections can be expressed in terms of , in general , non - hermitian operators , @xmath71 which are taken to act locally on one of the subsystems @xmath72 , @xmath73 for the characterization of these pure - state - trajectories the timing of jumps plays a central role because it may give rise to measurable events and to count- and waiting - time - statistics @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , these give only indirect evidence for the non - classicality of trajectories ( like , e.g. , anti - bunching ) .",
    "we therefore propose to supplement the analysis by directly referring to the motion in liouville - space .",
    "the characterization of single quantum trajectories with respect to classicality measures could be done in different ways .",
    "in addition to the possibilities presented below one may think of calculating the distribution functions of local as well as non - local coherence measures ( cf .",
    "( [ coherence_measures ] ) ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that these properties depend on the basic operators chosen for the state description . in the case",
    "that the coupling to the environment leads to the built - up of states which do not happen to coincide with eigenstates of the local operators @xmath74 , this approach will not show a classical limit ( i.e.  @xmath75 and/or @xmath63 remain unequal zero ) .",
    "there have been different proposals for defining a metric for density matrices ( see , e.g.  the bures metric @xcite , fidelity @xcite or mutual information @xcite ) . for the non - orthogonal glauber - states @xmath76 , e.g. , a  distance \"",

    "the maximum ( squared ) distance of 2 applies to orthogonal states . in the case of pure states",

    "sampling over one individual trajectory we find the corresponding distribution functions , @xmath107 .",
    "these are normalized : @xmath108      one easily shows that for any complete ( povm)-type measurement @xcite , the _ ensemble - averaged _ co - jump must be zero : for this purpose we write , for the ( ensemble ) density - operator after measurement in ( 2,1 ) , e.g.   @xmath109 with @xmath110 and consider ( overlines indicate ensemble - averaging ) @xmath111 here we have made use of the fact that @xmath112 and @xmath113 commute as they act on different sub - spaces .",
