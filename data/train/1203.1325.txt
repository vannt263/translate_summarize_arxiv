    "the discovery of neutrino masses @xcite motivates the introduction of right - handed neutrinos into the standard model and , by extension , into the minimal @xmath6 supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this right - handed neutrino extended mssm can arise from vacua of the @xmath7 heterotic superstring @xcite .",
    "specifically , smooth compactifications on elliptically fibered @xmath1 schoen manifolds @xcite with @xmath0 `` extension '' bundles @xcite can lead to four - dimensional , @xmath6 supersymmetric theories with exactly the particle spectrum of the mssm with three families of right - handed neutrino chiral supermultiplets , one per family , and no vector - like pairs or exotic states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the theory is invariant under the @xmath8 gauge group of the standard model .",
    "however , the fact that this `` extended '' mssm arises from heterotic string theory has important theoretical and phenomenological implications .",
    "first , and foremost , is the fact that the low energy gauge group @xmath9 must contain one extra @xmath10 factor .",
    "this is due to the fact that the last step in the symmetry breaking sequence @xmath11 group , as it is commonly called in the model building literature , as @xmath3 to be more mathematically correct . ]",
    "is accomplished by two `` wilson lines , '' each corresponding to a generator of the @xmath1 isometry group . since these wilson lines are abelian , they preserve the rank of the gauge group .",
    "it follows that the rank 5 @xmath3 group is spontaneously broken to the rank 4 standard model group plus an additional factor of @xmath10 , which can be associated with b - l ( baryon minus lepton number ) .",
    "that is , @xmath12 . a renormalization group analysis of this b - l mssm theory , including the radiative breaking of both b - l and electroweak symmetry , the associated b - l / ew hierarchy and predictions for the masses of the @xmath13 boson , the higgs bosons and all superpartners was presented in @xcite .",
    "the implications for proton decay , and dark matter , as well as a discussion of the associated cosmic strings , were given in @xcite and @xcite respectively , while consequences in the neutrino sector were discussed in @xcite    meanwhile , supersymmetric theories associated with b - l have had a long , rich history because of the intimate relationship between r - parity ( first defined in  @xcite ) and b - l : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the spin .",
    "the fate of r - parity plays a crucial role in the phenomenology and cosmology of supersymmetry .",
    "this relation was originally explored in the context of a global symmetry  @xcite and later expanded to gauged symmetries  @xcite and more minimally in  @xcite ; all of which resulted in r - parity violation .",
    "this was followed by a medley of works exploring both facets of the fate of r - parity in a variety of contexts , including  @xcite .",
    "recently , this b - l mssm theory was advanced in a series of papers  @xcite as the simplest b - l supersymmetric theory , since it only extends the mssm by the right - handed neutrinos required by anomaly cancellation .",
    "an automatic prediction follows : r - parity violation is spontaneously broken in minimal b - l models because only the right - handed sneutrino can break the b - l symmetry in a realistic way .",
    "these papers explored many of the consequences of this theory and showed it to be consistent with present experimental data .",
    "furthermore , these papers were recently supplemented by a discussion of the lepton number violating signals that could accompany the b - l mssm at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "therefore , from both the top - down and bottom - up point of view , the b - l mssm theory appears to be very compelling .",
    "the analyses in @xcite , in order to elucidate the mechanism for radiative b - l breaking and the b - l / ew hierarchy , necessarily was carried out over a relatively restricted set of initial parameters .",
    "in addition , the basis of generators of @xmath16 and @xmath17 is not `` orthogonal '' in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath18 .",
    "hence , the associated @xmath19 and @xmath20 field strengths exhibit `` kinetic mixing '' , both initially and at all lower scales .",
    "this greatly complicates the rges of the gauge couplings and was analyzed only approximately in @xcite .",
    "finally , the running parameters of the b - l mssm generically experience five mass `` thresholds '' , that is , scales where the coefficients of the associated rg beta functions change . in @xcite ,",
    "this was approximated by only three such masses , the other two being sufficiently close to these that , in a restricted regime of parameter space , they could safely be ignored .    in this paper",
    ", we rectify the last two of these problems .",
    "the first issue , carrying out the rg analysis for a greatly expanded set of initial parameters , will be analyzed in forthcoming work @xcite .",
    "we begin by presenting a detailed mathematical analysis of the cartan subalgebra of @xmath18 , deriving the two - dimensional subalgebra that commutes with @xmath4 and introducing the `` canonical '' basis which spans it .",
    "wilson lines derived from any linearly independent elements @xmath21 and @xmath22 of this subalgebra will spontaneously break @xmath23 .",
    "many , but not all , such bases will lead to the right - handed neutrino extended mssm spectrum at low energy . we will restrict our attention to those bases that do such as @xmath24,@xmath25 and @xmath26,@xmath25 , as well as to the specific `` non - canonical '' basis introduced and analyzed in appendix a. we show that , as with the @xmath16 , b - l generators discussed in @xcite , the quark / lepton and higgs superfields in both the canonical and non - canonical bases each arise from different @xmath27 and @xmath28 representations of @xmath3 respectively .",
    "it follows that the soft supersymmetry breaking terms , as well as the yukawa couplings , are uncorrelated by their origin in @xmath3 multiplets .",
    "this `` liberates '' the initial parameter space of these theories and has important implications for low energy .",
    "next , we introduce the killing inner product on the cartan subalgebra .",
    "it is shown that as long as the basis elements @xmath21,@xmath22 are orthogonal , that is , that their killing bracket vanishes , then kinetic mixing of the associated gauge field strengths at the initial `` unification '' scale will also vanish .",
    "both the canonical and specific non - canonical basis elements , but not the @xmath24,@xmath25 generators of @xcite , satisfy this condition .",
    "henceforth , we restrict our discussion to such orthogonal bases . using the rg analyses presented in @xcite",
    ", we then show that kinetic mixing will continue to vanish at all lower energy - momentum scales if and only if @xmath29 over the entire matter and higgs spectrum of the b - l mssm is zero . the canonical basis is shown to satisfy this condition and , hence , never exhibits kinetic mixing .",
    "however , in appendix a we show that the specific non - canonical basis does not .",
    "furthermore , we prove a theorem that the only orthogonal basis satisfying this condition is precisely the canonical basis , and appropriate multiples thereof .",
    "we note in passing that the @xmath24,@xmath25 generators of @xcite also do nt have vanishing trace over the b - l mssm .",
    "thus , in this paper , we identify a unique basis of generators @xmath26,@xmath25 whose low energy gauge group , @xmath30 , does not exhibit kinetic mixing at any scale .    for this reason , the bulk of this paper analyzes the mass thresholds , boundary conditions and rg running of the gauge parameters and soft gaugino masses associated with this canonical basis .",
    "an important aspect of the analysis is that the wilson lines associated with each of @xmath26,@xmath25 need not `` turn on '' at the same scale .",
    "rather , because the inverse radius of the `` hole '' in the calabi - yau threefold that they wrap depends on moduli , one such mass scale can precede the other , perhaps by as much as an order of magnitude . allowing for this , there are then two different `` breaking patterns '' . in the first ,",
    "@xmath3 is broken by the @xmath25 wilson line to an intermediate region containing a left - right type model .",
    "this has gauge group @xmath31 with a specific spectrum that we calculate directly from string theory . at a lower scale , @xmath32 ,",
    "the @xmath26 wilson line turns on and the theory becomes the extended mssm .",
    "conversely , if the @xmath26 wilson line turns on first , then @xmath3 is broken to a pati - salam type theory with gauge group @xmath33 and an explicit spectrum .",
    "again , we calculate this directly using string theory . at a lower scale , @xmath32 ,",
    "the @xmath25 wilson line turns on and the theory becomes the extended mssm .",
    "it is proven that in either case , subject to imposing the experimental values of the gauge couplings at the @xmath34-mass , @xmath32 can be chosen so as to enforce the unification of all gauge couplings , albeit for different values of @xmath32 . of course",
    ", if both wilson lines turn on simultaneously , then @xmath3 is broken immediately to the b - l mssm . in this case",
    ", gauge unification can not occur .    using this technology , in the final section we present a detailed discussion of the five mass thresholds , the boundary conditions at these scales , explicit computer analysis plotting the running of the gauge couplings and a discussion of the gaugino soft masses .",
    "this is done independently for both the left - right and pati - salam intermediate breaking patterns , imposing the experimental values of the gauge couplings at the @xmath34-mass .",
    "these plots show the unification of these couplings , and the explicit mass threshold behavior .",
    "the unification scale , the unified gauge coupling and the value of @xmath32 associated with such unification are evaluated in each case .",
    "finally , we present the results when both wilson lines are simultaneous and explore the extent to which the gauge parameters `` miss '' unification .",
    "we begin by searching for the most general @xmath5 subgroup of @xmath3 that commutes with @xmath35 .",
    "this is most easily carried out using the associated lie algebra @xmath18 , whose relevant properties can be found , for example , in @xcite .    we will identify the color subalgebra @xmath36 with the @xmath37 and @xmath38 nodes of the @xmath18 dynkin diagram shown in figure 1 .",

    "it follows that the initial value of @xmath61 at the unification scale , @xmath154 , must vanish .",
    "hence , there is a third property that the non - canonical basis shares with the canonical basis .",

    "_ + once the @xmath3 symmetry is broken by both wilson lines , either by turning them on at the same scale or sequentially , one expects the mixing parameter @xmath61 to regrow due to radiative corrections . in this case , the abelian field strengths develop a non - vanishing mixing term which greatly complicates the renormalization group analysis of the low energy effective theory .",
    "as discussed in detail in subsection [ pcb ] , at an arbitrary scale the covariant derivative can be written in an `` upper triangular '' realization given by @xmath507 with @xmath508 the rge for the off - diagonal coupling @xmath178 was presented in , and .",
