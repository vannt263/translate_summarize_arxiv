    "as is well known , high-@xmath6 superconductivity",
    "is realized by doping carriers into the cuo@xmath2 plane for the parent mott insulator .",
    "the insulator - metal transition ( imt ) of high-@xmath6 superconductors is significantly different from that of a doped semiconductor in the sense that the doped carriers exhibit superconductivity as soon as they become metallic .",
    "in fact , the mechanism of the imt is quite unconventional . for la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath7 ,",
    "for example , the doped carriers form a stripe , and the stripe direction changes from the diagonal to the parallel direction at imt @xcite .",
    "the bi - based cuprate bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( bi-2212 ) is considered to be the counter part to la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath7 .",
    "this compound is away from the stripe instability , and no static stripe order is reported for the parent insulator of bi-2212 .",
    "we have studied the transport properties of the parent insulator of bi-2212 , and proposed that the high - temperature charge dynamics is essentially similar to that for high-@xmath6 superconductors @xcite .",
    "previously we successfully prepared single crystals of the parent insulator bi@xmath2sr@xmath2rcu@xmath2o@xmath3 for various rare earth ions r ( r = dy , er , y ) , and found that r = er is most conducting @xcite .",
    "however the carrier concentration of the r = er sample was 0.03 hole per cu , which is still smaller than the critical concentration ( @xmath80.05 ) . in order to dope more holes in the cuo@xmath2 plane , we focus on the pb substitution . as is well established , the pb substitution for bi supplies holes for the superconducting samples of bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cuo@xmath9 and bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite . here",
    "we report on the characterization and charge transport of bi@xmath0pb@xmath1sr@xmath2ercu@xmath2o@xmath3 single crystals .",
    "-axis length of the prepared crystals as a function of the starting pb composition.,width=302 ]",
    "single crystals of bi@xmath0pb@xmath1sr@xmath2ercu@xmath2o@xmath3 were prepared by a bi@xmath2o@xmath10/cuo flux technique . a mixture of bi@xmath2o@xmath10 , pbo , srco@xmath10 , er@xmath2o@xmath10 and cuo powder was charged in an al@xmath2o@xmath10 crucible , heated up to 1373 k , slowly cooled down to 1173 k with a rate of 0.5 - 1 k / h .",
    "the ratio of the starting powder was bi : pb : sr : er : cu=2-@xmath4:@xmath11:2:1:2 , which is nearly stoichiometric except that the pb content was doubled . obtained crystals were plate - like , and the sizes were larger for larger @xmath4 with a typical dimension of 3@xmath123@xmath120.05 mm@xmath13 for @xmath4=0.6 and 0.8 . an energy - dispersive x - ray ( edx ) analysis revealed that bi+pb and sr are slightly excessive , and the content was estimated to be ( bi+pb)@xmath14sr@xmath15er@xmath16cu@xmath2o@xmath17 ( within an experimental error of 10% ) .",
    "the resistivity was measured with the four - probe method , and the @xmath18-plane thermopower was measured with the steady - state technique described previously @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-axis dielectric constant from 10@xmath19 to 10@xmath20 hz was measured with an rf lcr meter ( agilent 4287a ) with a similar technique by bhmer _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "pb@xmath1sr@xmath2ercu@xmath2o@xmath3 single crystals.,width=264 ]",
    "in fig . 1 is plotted the actual pb content and the @xmath5-axis length of the prepared crystals as a function of the starting pb composition .",
    "the actual pb content is well controlled , and well corresponds to the starting composition .",
    "the @xmath5-axis length does not systematically change with the pb content , whose reason is not understood at present .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath18-plane ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath5-axis ( @xmath22 ) resistivity . @xmath21 and @xmath22 decrease with increasing pb content , which indicates that the substituted pb supplies holes in the cuo@xmath2 plane . for @xmath4=0.8 , @xmath21 at 300 k is of the order of m@xmath23 cm , and a tiny drop ( a trace of superconductivity ) in @xmath21 and @xmath22 near 70 k is observed .",
    "these results clearly indicate that the doping level is very close to the imt .",
    "figure 3 shows the @xmath18-plane thermopower .",
    "although the magnitude systematically decreases with the pb content , the increase in the hole concentration is much smaller than expected . estimated from the room - temperature thermopower @xcite , the hole concentration per cu is increased only from 0.03 to 0.04 by increasing the pb content from 0 to 0.8 .",
    "this is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the value calculated by assuming that one pb@xmath24 ion supplies one hole .",
    "perhaps this is because the substituted pb removes the excess oxygen , which compensates the carrier concentration .",
    "in fact , the modulation structure in the bi@xmath2o@xmath2 plane due to the excess oxygen disappears near @xmath4=0.8 @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows the @xmath5-axis dielectric constant at 80 k. a systematic change with the pb content is seen , and the most conducting sample of @xmath4=0.8 exhibits a small and frequency - independent value .",
    "this is quite different from our previous measurement on the pb - free bi-2212 crystals , where the large magnitude with the dielectric relaxation is seen @xcite . at present we can not specify the reason of the difference , but we wonder whether the excess oxygen plays an important role . recent scanning tunnel microscope / spectroscopy has revealed unexpected inhomogeneous electronic states of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "_ @xcite found that the local density of states are inhomogeneous in the cuo@xmath2 plane of the optimally doped bi-2212 , where the doped carriers form a metallic patch .",
    "considering that the metallic patch is located near the excess oxygen , we think it natural that the charge is more or less homogeneous in the pb substituted ( and consequently excess - oxygen free ) sample . since the dielectric constant is a measure of the inhomogeneity @xcite , it would be small where the charge is homogeneously distributed . in any case",
    ", the dielectric constant does not diverge near the imt , which makes a remarkable contrast with the imt in doped semiconductors @xcite .",
    "single crystals of the pb - substituted bi-2212 parent insulator bi@xmath0pb@xmath1sr@xmath2ercu@xmath2o@xmath3 were successfully synthesised from @xmath4=0 to 0.8 .",
    "holes are systematically doped with increasing pb content , but the increased concentration is as small as 0.01 per cu from @xmath4=0 to 0.8 .",
    "the most conducting sample of @xmath4=0.8 is very close to the imt , and a tiny trace of superconductivity is observed .",
    "the dielectric constant is measured to be small and frequency - independent , which would imply that the charge is distributed more homogeneously than in the pb - free sample .",

    "they also thank a. fujimori , n. harima and k. tanaka for fruitful discussion .",
