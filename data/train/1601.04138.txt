    "it was established in @xcite that sssr-2 , sssr-3 do not hold , in general , for the photon multipolarity @xmath114 .    in @xcite the experiments on the test of sssrs with the absorption processes in he - like ion of uranium",
    "were suggested where the lasers can be used as a source for the the equivalent photons .",
    "an advantage of the use of the laser source is that all the photons will have the same frequency .",
    "if we divide this frequency by an integer number @xmath115 and adjust the laser frequency @xmath116 to the value of transitions frequency @xmath117 , @xmath118 , the number of photons @xmath115 in the absorption process will be fixed .    using transitions with the initial total electron momentum @xmath119 and the final momentum @xmath120 we will fix the total momentum of the photon system @xmath121 equal to @xmath122 .",

    "the value of the total angular momentum @xmath126 for @xmath127-photon system can be fixed by choosing the appropriate values @xmath128 and @xmath129 for the initial ( lower ) and final ( upper ) levels in the transition process .    in laser beam",
    "all the possible multipolarities of photon are presented .",
    "thus it should produce all the transitions with the same total parity : e1e1e1 , e1m1e2 , e1e1m2 etc .",
    "however the processes with the photons of higher multipolarities are usually strongly suppressed in atoms . due to this suppression",
    "the e1e1e1 transition will be dominant .",
    "measuring the absorption rate at the @xmath118 frequency one can establish the validity or non - validity of the particular sssrs : the atomic vapour should be transparent for the laser light at the frequency @xmath118 .",
    "note also that unlike the spontaneous emission which is very weak for multiphoton transitions , the multiphoton absorption depends on the laser intensity and can be well observed in the experiments .    in our examples we considered transitions between fine structure components with fixation of a certain fine structure subcomponents .",
    "varying the nuclear charge @xmath3 we can find the situation when each photon will be in optical range ( @xmath130 ev - @xmath131 ev ) .",
    "for example , to test the sssrs the h - like ions with @xmath132 can be examined . in this case transitions between fine structure components @xmath133 can be chosen .",
    "the energy intervals between @xmath134 and @xmath135 states for @xmath132 are listed in the 8th column of table iii and corresponding @xmath136 for @xmath123 is in the optical region .",
    "the nuclei of these ions are stable @xcite .",
    "it is important that for @xmath132 the hyperfine splitting both for @xmath0 and @xmath2 are resolvable ( see table iii ) i.e. the transition @xmath137 can be well separated out .",
    "the @xmath138 transition rate value is @xmath139 times smaller then the one - photon m2 transition rate .",
    "however tuning the laser frequency to the one third of transition frequencies excludes one - photon absorption .",
    "thus the frequency distribution depicted in fig . 1 ( and its two - dimensional sectional cut fig .",
    "2 ) should be observable in experiments of such type .",
