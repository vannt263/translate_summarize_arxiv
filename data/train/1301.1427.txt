    "dust grains produce extinction and reddening of stellar light from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the infrared ( ir ) ( draine 2003 ) . accurate determination of reddening to a star is vital for reliable derivation of its basic stellar parameters , such as distance , effective temperature and intrinsic spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .    using the _ iras _ and dirbe data , schlegel et al .",

    "they also find that the sfd map traces the dust well , but it overestimates @xmath2  by 14 per cent and reddening in @xmath28 and @xmath29 colors by up to 40 per cent .",

    "reddening of the target in a given color can then easily be calculated by comparing its observed color and intrinsic value , with the latter derived from its control stars . in a previous paper , we have used the `` standard pair '' technique ( stecher , 1965 ; massa , savage & fitzpatrick , 1983 ) to detect and measure diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) towards sightlines of a large sample of reddened stars ( yuan & liu 2012 ) . in the current work , the same technique is used to measure and study dust reddening and extinction from the uv to the mid - ir by combining data from the sdss and other photometric surveys , including the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ; martin et al .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the data sets and method used to measure the reddening in different colors .",
    "the reddening coefficients for different colors and extinction coefficients for different passbands are presented in section 3 and compared with previous studies and the predictions of a variety of galactic reddening laws .",

    "extinction curves are usually measured using the `` standard pair '' technique ( stecher , 1965 ; massa , savage & fitzpatrick , 1983 ) by comparing the photometric and/or spectrophotometric measurements of two stars of the same spectral type , one has negligible foreground dust while the other heavily reddened .",
    "comparison of the seds of the two stars , together with the assumption that the dust extinction goes to zero at very long wavelengths , allows one to determine the extinction @xmath30 as a function of wavelength @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the observed flux and @xmath33 is the flux in the absence of extinction .",
    "the method has been used to measure extinction curves for many sightlines , in many cases over a wavelength range extending from the vacuum uv to the near - ir .",
    "we use a similar `` standard pair '' method to measure reddening and then derive reddening coefficient of a given color .",
    "this method requires a target sample of highly reddened stars and a control sample of unreddened or of extremely low reddening stars of matching spectral types .",
    "control stars of matching spectral type are used to estimate the intrinsic colors of a target star . in order to maximize the numbers of target and control stars for different passbands ,",

    "with `` star pairs '' selected from sdss spectroscopic archive , combing the sdss , galex , 2mass and wise photometry that ranges from the far uv to the mid - ir , we have measured dust reddening in the @xmath80 and @xmath1 colors for thousands of stars . the measurements , together with @xmath2  values from sfd , are used to deduce the observed , model - free reddening coefficients for those colors .",
    "the new coefficients are compared to previous measurements in the literature and to the predictions of different dust reddening laws .",
    "the results show that :    * the dust reddening map of sfd over - estimate @xmath2  by about 14 per cent , consistent with the earlier studies of s10 and sf11 ; * after taking into account the differences in reddening normalization , our newly deduced reddening coefficients for the @xmath80 and @xmath1 colors differ by respectively @xmath51640% , 15.5% , 12.6% , @xmath50.8% , 3.4% , @xmath50.7% , 3.5% , 2.5% , 1.4% , 2.2% and @xmath550.7% from the predictions of the @xmath6  =  3.1 fitzpatrick reddening law , and by respectively @xmath51730% , 13.0% , 8.1% , 10.0% , 8.0% , @xmath513.5% , @xmath51.7% , @xmath56.7% , @xmath517.1% , @xmath517.7% and @xmath558.6% from the predictions of the @xmath6  =  3.1 ccm reddening law ; * the new reddening coefficients for colors from @xmath70 to @xmath1 prefer the @xmath6  =  3.1 fitzpatrick reddening law to the @xmath6  =  3.1 ccm and odonnell reddening laws",
    ". however , the fitzpatrick law seems to under - predict @xmath60 and @xmath61 by about 12 per cent , indicating an update of the fitzpatrick law in the uv is needed .    using the extinction coefficient of @xmath9 band given by the @xmath6  =  3.1 fitzpatrick law and the observed reddening coefficients presented in this work , we have obtained new extinction coefficients for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 passbands .",
    "we recommend that the new reddening and extinction coefficients should be generally used when performing reddening correction of galactic stars with the sfd dust map in future .",
    "we stress however that the @xmath12- and @xmath13-band coefficients should be used with caution given their relatively large measurement uncertainties .    *",
    "acknowledgments * we would like to thank the referee for his / her valuable comments , which helped improve the quality of the paper significantly .",
