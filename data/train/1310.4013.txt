    "thus we can consider the statistical error of the conductivity calculation to be about 2% .",
    "we can use expression ( [ eq : statisticalerror ] ) to estimate the statistical error only if the ionic configurations are independent .",
    "the significant decrease of the velocity - velocity autocorrelation function during the time between two subsequent configurations could be a good criterion of the independence of configurations . in this work , however , this criterion is not used .",

    "[ fig : natomsdependence ] shows the dependence of the calculated dynamic electrical conductivity on the number of atoms in the supercell .        the change of the number of atoms from 108 to 256 leads to the significant changes in the dynamic electrical conductivity . for example for the frequency @xmath90  ev the conductivity changes by the factor of 1.3 .",
    "at the frequencies near to zero the change of the conductivity is about 10% .",
    "evidently , even larger numbers of atoms should be taken to achieve the convergence .",
    "but at the current stage it looks more reasonable to take the results obtained with the largest ( 256 ) number of atoms .    it should be mentioned , that the convergence with the number of atoms is strongly connected with the dependence of the results on the broadening of the @xmath36-function in the kubo - greenwood formula .",

    "a ) b )      the dependence of the calculated transport and optical properties on the broadening @xmath38 of the @xmath36-function in the kubo - greenwood formula ( [ eq : deltabroadening ] ) is rather important ( especially at low frequencies ) .",
    "the dependence of the dynamic electrical conductivity at low frequencies on the broadening of the @xmath36-function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaedependence]a .",
    "the kubo - greenwood formula takes into account the transitions between all bands . in the real substance",
    "the number of atoms is very large , the bands are very close to each other",
    ". therefore a smooth curve of dynamic electrical conductivity @xmath29 is formed .",
    "the number of atoms in numerical calculation is rather small , and the transition between each two bands gives its own @xmath36-peak to the curve of dynamic electrical conductivity . to form a smooth curve ,",
    "each @xmath36-peak is to be broadened by the gaussian function ( [ eq : deltabroadening ] ) . if the broadening @xmath38 is too small ( 0.02  ev in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaedependence]a ) , the transitions between bands are still noticeable and the curve is oscillating . if the broadening @xmath38 is too large ( 0.2  ev in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaedependence]a ) , too many transitions contribute to each point on the @xmath29 curve and the physical dependence on the frequency is smoothed .",
    "we consider , that the convergence according to the broadening @xmath38 must occur as follows : when the broadening is diminished , at first , excessive smoothing of physical dependence disappears .",
    "then for some @xmath38 value the further diminishing of the broadening does not affect the @xmath29 .",
    "for some range of @xmath38 the curves do not depend on the broadening and any curve from this range may be taken as final . and",
    "only at very small values of @xmath38 the oscillations appear .    at rather high frequencies ( above 1  ev in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaedependence]a ) the situation is similar to the described above .",
    "but at low frequencies the situation is different .",
    "when the broadening is diminished the oscillations appear earlier than the convergence of the dynamic electrical conductivity is reached .",
    "the convergence with the broadening @xmath38 can be improved by the increasing of the number of atoms . when the number of atoms is relatively big , it becomes possible to take smaller value of @xmath38 to reach the convergence according to this parameter and avoid the appearance of oscillations .",
    "[ fig : deltaedependence]b confirms this statement : the curves for the same values @xmath38 are less smooth than in fig .  [ fig : deltaedependence]a .",
    "at the currently available number of atoms ( 256 , fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaedependence]a ) the error connected with the choice of @xmath38 is not less than 3% ( the difference between the curves for @xmath83  ev and @xmath91  ev ) .",
    "the value of energy cut - off @xmath82  ev is used during the precise resolution of the band structure .",
    "the increasing of the energy cut - off to the value of 400  ev leads to the negligible ( less than 1% ) change of dynamic electrical conductivity within the whole range of frequencies under consideration . on the other hand , the diminishing of the energy cut - off to the value of 100  ev leads to the excessive ( up to 13% ) changes in the dynamic electrical conductivity .",
    "therefore the value @xmath82  ev is optimal during the precise resolution of the band structure .    during the qmd simulation",
    "the smaller value of the energy cut - off @xmath81  ev is used .",
    "the increasing of the energy cut - off to the value 200  ev leads to the changes of dynamic electrical conductivity not larger than 3% in the whole range of frequencies under consideration . on the other hand ,",
    "the qmd simulation with the energy cut - off 200  ev requires significant computation time .",
    "therefore the error connected with energy cut - off convergence is estimated as 3% .",

    "this leads to some difficulties . at this stage",
    "we get pseudo wave functions from vasp , use them to calculate pseudo matrix elements @xmath92 , and then use them to calculate the dynamic electrical conductivity via the kubo - greenwood formula ( [ eq : kubogreenwoodsigma ] ) .",

    "the vasp package provides the module that calculates all electron matrix elements @xmath93 .",

    "if some of the occupied bands are neglected , their contribution to electron density will be missed and ionic configurations will be calculated inaccurately .",
    "we consider the bands with the fermi - weights larger than @xmath94 ( standard vasp precision during output of the fermi - weights ) to be occupied .",
