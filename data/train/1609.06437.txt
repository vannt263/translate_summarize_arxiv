    "dynamical decoupling is a powerful method to combat decoherence of quantum systems caused by coupling to slow - varying environment @xcite .",
    "conventional dynamical decoupling requires to apply a sequence of strong instantaneous pulses @xcite , with the pulse duration shorter than other time scales in the system so that the control sequence can be approximated by @xmath0-pulses or unbounded control hamiltonians .",
    "decoupling schemes based on finite - width pulses , such as the magic - echo trains , have been proposed and implemented in experiments @xcite , however , they still require the driving amplitude to be much higher than other dynamical parameters in the system @xcite . dynamical decoupling has been used in a number of quantum information systems to suppress decoherence , with particular applications to the solid state spin qubits @xcite .",
    "as any control hamiltonian in real systems always has bounded parameters , the need of strong pulses with amplitudes larger than other dynamical parameters may impose a serious restriction on applications of the dynamical decoupling method .",
    "theoretically , a method called the eulerian decoupling scheme has been proposed to overcome this problem @xcite .",
    "the eulerian decoupling is highly robust to variation in the pulse length and shape as long as the integral of the pulse completes a @xmath1-rotation on the target spin , eliminating the challenging requirement on the pulse amplitude or duration .    in this paper",
    ", we report an experimental demonstration of effectiveness of the eulerian decoupling scheme .",
    "we test performance and robustness of the eulerian decoupling under various noise environments , using the solid - state spin qubits carried by the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in a diamond sample .",
    "recently , the nv centers in the diamond have stood out as a promising system for realization of quantum information processing 15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 .",
    "the coherence of this system can be well controlled and manipulated even at room temperature @xcite . here",
    ", we use this system as a testbed for various dynamical decoupling protocols and show that the eulerian decoupling scheme with long soft pulses is almost equally effective as the conventional schemes based on strong instantaneous pulses . the natural nuclear spin environment around the diamond nv  centers",
    "provides a source of dephasing noise . to study the effectiveness of the eulerian decoupling scheme under general noise including both dephasing and relaxation , we realize a general noise model by injecting microwave noise . under various noise models ,",
    "we demonstrate that the corresponding eulerian decoupling scheme can increase the coherence time of the system by two orders of magnitude in our experiment .",
    "the demonstration of effectiveness of the eulerian decoupling scheme may stimulate applications of this powerful method to systems where strong control pulses are hard to achieve compared with the system - environment coupling rate .",
    "in the dynamical decoupling scheme , the control hamiltonian is denoted by @xmath2 with its corresponding propagator given by the time - ordered integration @xmath3 . in the conventional scheme based on instantaneous pulses ,",
    "the propagator @xmath4 suddenly changes from @xmath5 to @xmath6 by the pulse @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) with @xmath9for @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the time segment between adjacent pulses and the whole control cycle consists of @xmath12 pulse with total time @xmath13 .",
    "the evolution operators @xmath14 form a group @xmath15 and the dynamical decoupling works as we require the system - environment coupling hamiltonian is averaged out to zero over this group @xmath15 . for the eulerian decoupling scheme , the instantaneous pulse is replaced by any continuous pulse which satisfies the condition @xmath16 .",
    "for the eulerian decoupling scheme to work , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) over one complete control cycle has to follow the so - called eulerian path in the graph with @xmath19 as the vertices .",
    "if the noise is purely dephasing ( @xmath20 error ) , the simplest eulerian path is given by @xmath21 , which corresponds to the conventional car - purcell - meiboom - gill ( cpmg ) echo pulse sequence @xmath22 .",
    "we use @xmath23 in this paper to denote the three pauli operators .",
    "so the cpmg  sequence should work for the dephasing noise even when we replace the instantaneous @xmath24-pulse by a slow pulse as long as the pulse area is @xmath25 for each control segment .",
    "if the noise is universal including both dephasing and relaxation ( @xmath23 errors ) , the simplest decoupling sequence with instantaneous pulses is the xy4 sequence @xmath26",
    ". the simplest eulerian path in this case , however , is given by @xmath27 , which corresponds to the xy8 pulse sequence @xmath28 .",
    "according to the eulerian decoupling scheme , the xy8 sequence should work for any slow pulse of arbitrary shape as long as the pulse area integrated over the duration @xmath29 is @xmath24 for each segment .      in our experiment , we use the electron spin qubit of a nv center in a single crystal diamond to test effectiveness of the eulerian decoupling scheme . our experimental setup is described in detail in ref . @xcite and the appendix .",
    "we compare the performance of various pulse sequences under both dephasing and universal noise .",
    "the pulse sequences tested in this paper are shown in fig .",
    "1 . note that we use the cpmg  ysequence @xmath30 instead of the x sequence to combat the dephasing noise ( z error ) as the y sequence is more robust to the systematic x error if we prepare and measure the superposition state with x pulses in the ramsey measurement scheme . the dephasing noise in our experiment is provided by the natural coupling of the electron spin to the surrounding nuclear spins in the diamond crystal , which induces dephasing with @xmath31 @xmath32 measured through the free induction decay under an external magnetic filed of @xmath33 g applied along the nv  axis ( shown in fig .",

    "we compare the performance of the xy4 and xy8 sequences under slow and fast pulses with the following two observations : first , we note that the overall coherence time becomes shorter , and the xy4 sequence is significantly inferior to the xy8 sequence in performance even under fast pulses .",
    "this is caused by the requirement of a smaller pulse period @xmath44 in this case and thus fast accumulation of the systematic pulse errors .",
    "as it is well known , the xy8 sequence is more insensitive to accumulation of the systematic pulse errors compared with the xy4 sequence as it suppresses the systematic errors and the spin relaxation noise to a higher order @xcite . under pure dephasing",
    ", the pulse period @xmath44 is required to be small compared with the bath correlation time ; while under both dephasing and relaxation , the pulse period @xmath44 needs to be small compared with the time scale of @xmath71 and @xmath50 ( the inverse of the relaxation and the dephasing rates ) . the latter sets a more stringent requirement and we need to reduce @xmath44 by about a factor of @xmath54 in our experiment .",
    "the overall coherence time correspondingly decreases under the same number of pulses .",
    "second , for the xy4 sequence the fast pulses significantly outperform the slow pulses , while for the xy8 sequence they give similar results .",
    "this is in agreement with prediction of the eulerian decoupling theory . in fig .",
    "4d , we also test performance of the slow pulses under different pulse shapes , for instance , with a gaussian instead of a square shape , and find that the slow pulses under different shapes all give very similar results , with performance comparable to that of fast instantaneous pulses .     and",

    "in summary , we have reported an experimental test of the eulerian dynamical decoupling scheme in a solid state spin system and find that the slow soft pulses , under appropriate conditions , are able to give noise suppression comparable to the performance of strong instantaneous pulses .",
    "the experimental demonstration of the eulerian decoupling scheme with slow pulses and its effectiveness eliminates a challenging requirement in conventional dynamical decoupling techniques and may find important applications in physical systems where the system - environment coupling is large and it is difficult to apply strong control pulses with amplitudes much higher than any other system or environment dynamical parameters 8 .",
