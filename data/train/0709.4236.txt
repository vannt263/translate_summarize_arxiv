    ". a binary fraction of about 9% at wide separations ( a @xmath6 25 au ) was obtained by allen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , after examining more than 1200 high - velocity and metal - poor stars . other smaller surveys of metal - deficient stars indicate a slightly higher frequency of @xmath214% ( e.g. martn & rebolo 1992 ) .",

    "however , latham et al . ( 2002 ) conducted a spectroscopic survey of high proper motion stars , and found no difference in the fraction of halo and disk binaries at close separations ( a @xmath4 7 au ) .",
    "a similar result was obtained at wide separations ( a @xmath7 100 au ) by chanam@xmath8 & gould ( 2004 ) , who found no significant differences between the binary characteristics in the halo and the disk populations .",
    "these authors thus concluded that the two binary populations probably formed under similar environmental conditions .",
    "zapatero osorio & martn ( 2004 ) report a binary fraction of about 9% in wide orbits ( a @xmath9 30 au ) for their sample of metal - poor gkm stars , with no obvious discrepancy in the orbital separations of metal - depleted binaries and solar - metallicity multiple stars . using a conservative limit of k - band flux ratios larger than 0.1 , zinnecker et al .",

    "if there exists a significant number of m subdwarf binary systems with faint very low - mass ( @xmath50.1 @xmath3 ) companions , this would result in a steeper drop at the faint end of the halo luminosity function than that observed .",
    "a high fraction of equal - mass m subdwarf binaries on the other hand would result in a broader peak , shifted towards the brighter end .",
    "the presence of unresolved m subdwarf binary systems could thus alter the observed halo luminosity function .",
    "the observed luminosity function can be converted into the corresponding mf by the application of a mass - luminosity relation .",
    "there exists no calibration of such a relation for the lowest - mass metal - poor stars , making it crucial to identify a binary star system suitable for empirical mass measurements .",
    "we present here results from a _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) snapshot search for binary systems among nearby m subdwarfs .",
    "this supplements a previous snapshot program that only obtained nine observations ( gizis & reid 2000 ; hereafter gr ) . for their nine targets , gr failed to identify a single binary system and thus concluded that below 0.3 @xmath3 , the halo binary fraction is less than or equal to that in the disk .",

    "we note that the reality of this bimodality is not firmly established , and their distribution is based on small numbers .",

    "our survey is sensitive to sub - stellar companions at separations in the range of 6 - 30 au .",
    "however , none could be detected for any of the targets .",
    "combining our results with those from gr , we have a binary fraction of about 3% ( 1/28 ) . including the probable wide binary system lhs 1074 increases the fraction to 7% .",
    "reid & gizis ( 1997 ) report a fraction of 35% for disk m dwarfs within 8 pc of the sun .",

    "this indicates a weak probability ( at a high confidence level ) for the m subdwarf fraction to be as large as what is found in the disk .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of a few m subdwarf binary systems mentioned above suggests that the fraction must be higher than the 3% obtained here .",
    "gelino & kirkpatrick ( 2006 ) have reported a 13% fraction for metal - poor gkm stars , similar to the 15% obtained by latham et al .",

    "2 indicates that the probability for the m subdwarf binary fraction to be between 10 and 15% is about 17% , at a confidence level of 68.3% .",
    "thus while the binary frequency for the lowest - mass stars in the halo may be less than that in the disk , there is a fair probability that it may be as high as what is found for the solar - type halo stars . among these higher mass stars , while no significant differences have been observed by latham et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , zapatero osorio & martn ( 2004 ) and other surveys in the characteristics of the disk and halo binaries , the fractions reported by these authors ( 13 - 15% ) are much smaller than that found by duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 ; 57% ) .",
    "if we consider only the wide - binary fraction with separations @xmath730 pc , then the fraction reported by duquennoy & mayor would be half of 57% , or about 30% . nevertheless , this suggests that overall , multiplicity may be rarer among gkm halo stars than those in the disk population . as suggested by stryker et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , since the initial distribution of binary - system separation has not been greatly altered with time , any differences in the binary frequency of the disk and halo populations would reflect differing conditions in the collapsing galaxy and its effects on stellar condensation .    considering the case of lhs 1074 , we can estimate the expected number of stars within 3@xmath10 of the target .",
    "the acs ( wfc ) channel has a field of view of @xmath2202@xmath12 202@xmath10 . within this field of view",
    ", the estimated number of background stars is found to be 3.5e-04 , which results in the expected number of stars within 3@xmath10 to be 0.0099 .",
    "in other words , there is a @xmath21% probability of detecting a background star within a 3@xmath10 radius of the target , or a 99% probability of not detecting any background star within this radius . in a sample size of 28 then , there is a 3 in 4 chance of not finding a background star within 3@xmath10 .",
    "the faint object at 2.1@xmath10 separation from lhs 1074 thus has a weak 25% probability of being a background star .",
    "if indeed lhs 1074 is a binary and this is not a chance alignment , then an absolute _ i _ magnitude of 17.93 would make the faint star most likely sub - stellar .",
    "dynamical evolution can lead to significant differences between the present day mf and the initial mf ( imf ) .",
    "the presence of a substantial number of unresolved binaries may drastically alter the present day mf .",
    "the luminosity of a binary is caused by light from both stars . if the light is interpreted to be only from a single star , then the mass of the star would be overestimated .",
    "graff & freese ( 1996 ) have studied the effects of unresolved binaries on the derived mf in the halo , and have shown that the mfs generated by their binary models are steeper towards lower masses compared to the no - binary model .",
    "decreasing the metallicity also causes the mf to steepen towards lower masses .",
    "de marchi et al . (",
    "2004 ) have discussed whether the shift seen in the peak of the imf for gcs , compared to that for young clusters ( yc ) , indicates dynamical evolution in the gcs .",
    "for ycs of ages between @xmath20.5 and @xmath2800 myr , these authors estimate the imf to peak at @xmath20.15 @xmath3 .",
    "the present day gc mf is found to peak at about 0.33 @xmath3 . since the mf of a dozen gcs",
    "are found to be very similar ( paresce & de marchi 2000 ) , this suggests they could all share the same imf with a peak at @xmath20.33 @xmath3 . as discussed in de marchi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , since any low - mass stars lost by gcs should populate the halo , if the imf of gcs was originally similar to that of the ycs , then the halo mf should also peak at @xmath20.15 @xmath3 .",
    "this is found to be true .",
    "however , the large uncertainties due to various factors discussed earlier make the current derivation of the halo mf inaccurate . on the other hand ,",
    "if the presence of a substantial number of unresolved binaries results in a halo mf similar to that currently observed in the gcs , this would indicate that their present day mf does not differ significantly from the imf ( de marchi et al .",
    "observations of large samples of metal - poor low - mass stars are required to accurately determine the halo binary fraction and test these hypotheses .",
    "our survey is not sensitive enough to detect very short - period binaries ( separations less than @xmath20.1@xmath10 ) , or sub - stellar companions at separations less than 6 au .",
    "radial velocity surveys can play an important role in detecting sub - stellar companions or objects at very close separations , that may have been missed out in imaging searches .",
    "the absence of any binary systems in our sample other than lhs 2140/2139 could be explained by selection biases . among disk stars ,",
    "a drop in the wide ( @xmath6 20 au ) binary frequency is observed for primaries with masses less than 0.1@xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with the sharp decline observed in the number of stars with masses below the peak ( 0.1 @xmath3 ) in the disk mf .",
    "the gc mf is found to peak at about 0.33@xmath3 , with a drop in the number of stars per unit mass below the peak mass .",
    "all of our targets have masses below @xmath20.2 @xmath3 , suggesting that the decrease in multiplicity with decreasing mass seen in the disk for masses below 0.1@xmath3 might also be happening in the halo , but at a higher mass of about 0.3@xmath3 .",
    "a higher fraction may be obtained if the m subdwarf primaries selected have masses higher than the peak in the mf .",
    "combining ours and gr survey , a sample of 28 is still too small in size .",
    "a larger sample of metal - poor m - type stars needs to be examined to determine the differences in the binary frequencies of the disk and the halo populations , that may reflect upon the differing conditions in the early galaxy and its effects on binary formation .",
