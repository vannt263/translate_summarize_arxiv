    "the orbital degree of freedom of the electron has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to the rich variety of electronic , magnetic , and transport properties exhibited by orbitally degenerate systems such as the ferromagnetic manganites , which have highlighted the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in these correlated electron systems.@xcite orbital fluctuations , correlations , and orderings have been observed in raman spectroscopic studies@xcite of orbiton modes in @xmath7 , polarization - contrast - microscopy studies@xcite of @xmath8 , magnetic susceptibility and inelastic neutron scattering studies@xcite of @xmath9 , and resonant inelastic soft x - ray scattering studies@xcite of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . a new detection method for orbital structures and ordering based on spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy is of strong current interest@xcite in orbitally active metallic systems such as strontium ruthenates and iron pnictide superconductors .",
    "the role of orbital fluctuations on magnetic couplings and excitations is of strong current interest in view of the several zone - boundary anomalies observed in spin - wave excitation measurements in the metallic ferromagnetic phase of colossal magnetoresistive ( cmr ) manganites.@xcite the presence of short - range dynamical orbital fluctuations has been suggested in neutron scattering studies of ferromagnetic metallic manganite @xmath12.@xcite these observations are of the crucial importance for a quantitative understanding of the carrier - induced spin - spin interactions , magnon excitations , and magnon damping , and have highlighted possible limitations of existing theoretical approaches .",
    "for example , the observed magnon dispersion in the @xmath6-x direction shows significant softening near the zone boundary , indicating non - heisenberg behaviour usually modeled by including a fourth neighbour interaction term @xmath13 , and highlighting the limitation of the double - exchange model .",
    "similarly , the prediction of magnon - phonon coupling as the origin of magnon damping@xcite and of disorder as the origin of zone - boundary anomalous softening@xcite have been questioned in recent experiments.@xcite furthermore , the dramatic difference in the sensitivity of long - wavelength and zone - boundary magnon modes on the density of mobile charge carriers has emerged as one of the most puzzling feature . observed for a finite range of carrier concentrations , while the spin stiffness remains almost constant , the anomalous softening and broadening of the zone - boundary modes show substantial enhancement with increasing hole concentration.@xcite    theoretically , the role of orbital - lattice fluctuations and correlations on magnetic couplings and excitations has been investigated within an orbitally degenerate double exchange model with an inter - orbital interaction @xmath14 and the jahn - teller coupling.@xcite based on a strong coupling expansion , this approach is restricted to the strong coupling limit @xmath15 .",
    "the final calculations for the magnon self energy , carried out in terms of a phenomenological parameter , show significant zone - boundary magnon softening only for ferromagnetic orbital correlations , and extremely close to the orbital ordering instability .",
    "if orbital fluctuations have signature effects on magnetic excitations in a ferromagnet with orbital degree of freedom , they can be probed indirectly through neutron scattering studies .",
    "a detailed investigation of the orbital fluctuation magnon self energy is therefore of strong current interest , especially with respect to dependence on inter - orbital interaction strength , band filling , and different orbital fluctuation modes . in this paper",
    "we will present a theory for spin - orbital coupling and magnon self energy , and examine how the correlated motion of electrons in the presence of strong orbital correlations near the orbital ordering instability influences magnetic couplings and excitations .",
    "we will employ a diagrammatic approach which allows interpolation in the full range of interaction strength from weak to strong coupling . in this approach correlation effects in the form of self energy and vertex corrections",
    "are incorporated systematically so that the goldstone mode is preserved order by order .",
    "based on a systematic inverse - degeneracy expansion scheme,@xcite the approach has been used recently to study spin - charge coupling effects , which give rise to strong magnon energy softening , damping , and non - heisenberg behaviour in metallic ferromagnets.@xcite    the present work will also extend the recent investigation into role of orbital degeneracy and hund s coupling on magnetic couplings and excitations in a band ferromagnet.@xcite orbital degeneracy and hund s coupling were shown to enhance ferromagnetism by strongly suppressing correlation - induced quantum corrections to spin stiffness and magnon energies . an effective quantum parameter was obtained for determining the magnitude of quantum corrections , and the theory was applied to calculate the spin stiffness for a realistic multi - orbital system such as iron .",
    "we will show here that the spin stiffness remains essentially unaffected by the interaction @xmath14 due to the non - heisenberg @xmath5 behaviour of the magnon self energy resulting from orbital fluctuations and correlations .    in manganites , an important role",
    "is also played by the cooperative jahn - teller distortion of o@xmath16 ions which lifts the two - fold degeneracy of @xmath17 electronic levels of mn due to a combination of orbital geometry and electrostatic repulsion , leading to staggered orbital correlations .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the local orbital moment and staggered orbital correlations introduced by the inter - orbital density interaction @xmath18 which relatively pushes up the @xmath19 orbital energy if the @xmath20 orbital density @xmath21 is more than average , thus self consistently lifting the orbital degeneracy .",
    "therefore , orbital correlations and fluctuations due to dynamical jahn - teller distortion can be qualitatively treated in terms of an effective inter - orbital interaction .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "starting with a degenerate two - orbital hubbard model including an inter - orbital interaction @xmath14 , the first order quantum correction diagrams for the irreducible particle - hole propagator are obtained in section ii . as basic ingredients in the diagrammatics , spin and orbital fluctuations",
    "are briefly discussed in section iii .",
    "the magnon self energy contributions due to orbital fluctuations and spin - orbital coupling are obtained in sections iv and v. the interplay between magnetic and charge contributions to the spin - orbital interaction vertex is discussed in section vi , and orbital fluctuations near @xmath0 are shown to yield strong zone - boundary magnon softening .",
    "extension to finite hund s coupling @xmath22 and the ferromagnetic kondo lattice model are discussed in sections vii and viii , and conclusions are presented in section ix .",
    "we will consider a two - orbital hubbard model @xmath23 on a simple cubic lattice with two orbitals ( labeled by @xmath24 ) per site and intra - orbital nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath25 .",
    "the coulomb interaction matrix elements included here are the intra - orbital interaction @xmath26 , the inter - orbital density interaction @xmath14 , and the inter - orbital exchange interaction ( hund s coupling ) @xmath22 .",
    "the last term represents the transverse part ( @xmath27 ) of the hund s coupling , and the density interaction term yields the longitudinal part @xmath28 , so that altogether the hund s coupling term has the form @xmath29 .",
    "the hamiltonian therefore possesses continuous spin rotation symmetry , and hence the goldstone mode must exist in the spontaneously broken symmetry state .",
    "hund s coupling has been shown to strongly enhance ferromagnetism in an orbitally degenerate system by strongly suppressing the correlation - induced quantum corrections.@xcite an effective quantum parameter @xmath30/[u+({\\cal n}-1)j]^2 $ ] was obtained for determining the magnitude of quantum corrections for an @xmath31-orbital system , in analogy with @xmath32 for quantum spin systems .",
    "the rapid decrease of this quantum factor from 1 to @xmath33 as @xmath34 increases from 0 to 1 results in strong suppression of quantum corrections and hence significant stabilization of ferromagnetism by hund s coupling , particularly for large @xmath31 .    in order to highlight the role of inter - orbital coulomb interaction @xmath14 and orbital fluctuations on magnetic couplings and excitations in this paper",

    "this systematic approach is non - perturbative with respect to the interaction terms and therefore yields a controlled approximation which remains valid in the strong coupling limit .",

    "( 7 ) .    for the spin - orbital coupling magnon energy , however , the interaction ladders in diagrams fig . 1(d ) and fig . 2 now involve hund s coupling @xmath22 as well , and since the transverse part of @xmath22 flips the orbital index in the ladder series , there are now two contributions to the irreducible particle - hole propagator : @xmath161 ^ 2   v_{\\rm eff } ^{\\alpha\\mu } ( { \\bf q - q},\\omega-\\omega)\\ ] ] involving intra @xmath162 and inter @xmath163 orbital spin and orbital fluctuations . involving ladders of @xmath26 and @xmath22 , the effective intra and inter - orbital transverse spin interactions : @xmath164   \\approx \\frac{(u+j)^2}{2 } \\left [ \\frac{\\chi_0}{1-u^+ \\chi_0 } \\pm \\frac{\\chi_0}{1-u^- \\chi_0 } \\right ] \\ ] ] can be expressed as in - phase @xmath162 and out - of - phase @xmath163 combinations of the acoustic and optical branches,@xcite with @xmath165 .",
    "similarly , the effective intra and inter - orbital density interactions : @xmath166 involve odd and even number of bubbles .",
    "now , in the investigation of role of hund s coupling on quantum corrections,@xcite it was shown that the inter - orbital component @xmath167 yields a small @xmath78-integrated contribution due to partial cancellation from the out - of - phase combination of the acoustic and optical modes , essentially reflecting an inter - orbital incoherence .",
    "therefore , the inter - orbital component @xmath168 should be relatively small , and the intra - orbital component @xmath169 is approximately given by eq .",
    "( 15 ) , with @xmath14 replaced by @xmath160 and @xmath26 replaced by @xmath170 .    due to the purely opposite - spin density interaction @xmath159 , the interaction line @xmath26 connected to the bubble in the third diagram in fig .",
    "2(b ) for the three - fermion vertex @xmath109 is also replaced by @xmath170 .",
    "this is consistent with the enhanced exchange splitting to @xmath171 in the @xmath172 energy denominator , which changes the magnon pole condition to @xmath173 , and ensures that the three - fermion vertex @xmath109 exactly vanishes at @xmath45 in accordance with the goldstone - mode condition ( see appendix ) .",
    "magnetic couplings and excitations in ferromagnetic manganites have been theoretically investigated using the ferromagnetic kondo lattice model ( fklm ) and its strong coupling limit , the double exchange ferromagnet . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath174 core spins due to localized @xmath175 electrons of the magnetic mn@xmath176 ions are exchange coupled to the mobile @xmath17 band electrons , represented by an interaction term @xmath177 , with @xmath178 of order bandwidth @xmath72 .",
    "the fermionic representation approach for evaluating magnon self energy corrections in the fklm , which allows conventional diagrammatic tools to be employed for evaluating quantum corrections beyond the leading order,@xcite can be readily extended to include effects of orbital fluctuations .    with",
    "an inter - orbital interaction @xmath14 included between the two degenerate @xmath17 orbitals , the fklm magnon self energy due to spin - orbital coupling can be directly obtained from our magnon renormalization analysis of fig .",
    "the required correspondence is : @xmath179 and @xmath180 , so that the exchange splitting @xmath181 .",
    "the fklm magnon self energy is thus obtained from our calculated hubbard model result using a multiplicative factor @xmath182 . with @xmath183 , @xmath102 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185",
    ", we obtain @xmath186 .",
    "as the fklm bare magnon energy @xmath187 is smaller than the hubbard model bare magnon energy @xmath188 by roughly the same factor , the fklm renormalized magnon energy @xmath189 will also be as in fig .",
    "6 , only scaled down by a factor ( 1/6 ) . taking the hopping energy scale @xmath190mev corresponding to a realistic bandwidth @xmath191ev , the magnon energy scale in fig .",
    "6 is @xmath192mev for ferromagnetic manganites , in agreement with the measured magnon energies.@xcite    since the fklm magnon self energy goes as the fourth power of @xmath193 explicitly , the anomalous zone - boundary softening effect should be especially pronounced in narrow - band systems .",
    "indeed , zone - boundary magnon softening is clearly seen to occur in the relatively low-@xmath194 or narrow - band materials , and broad - band materials such as @xmath195 show nearly heisenberg behavior , in agreement with this prediction .",
    "systematic studies of doping dependence of the zone - boundary magnon softening indicates that the higher the doping level , the larger the zone - boundary softening.@xcite furthermore , doping dependence of spin dynamics indicates that the measure spin stiffness @xmath196 mev @xmath197 remains essentially unchanged , while the zone - boundary magnon softening ( denoted by the ratio @xmath198 ) is found to be enhanced linearly with increasing doping .",
    "the correlated motion of electrons in the presence of strong orbital fluctuations and correlations was investigated in an orbitally degenerate ferromagnet with two orbitals per site with respect to magnetic couplings and excitations .",
    "a systematic goldstone - mode - preserving approach was employed to incorporate correlation effects in the form of self energy and vertex corrections , so that both long - wavelength and zone - boundary magnon modes could be studied on an equal footing .",
    "our investigation focussed on the anomalous momentum dependence of the three- and four - fermion interaction vertices which determine the magnon self energy and the role of different orbital fluctuation modes , particularly near the orbital ordering instability where orbital fluctuations are relatively soft .",
    "orbital fluctuations were generically shown to impart an intrinsically non - heisenberg @xmath199 character to the magnon self energy in the @xmath6-x direction of interest .",
    "this generic behaviour was ascribed to a quadratic structure of the spin - orbital interaction vertex resulting from a new class of diagrammatic contributions associated with the orbital degree of freedom .",
    "these diagrams are absent in the single - orbital case , the essential difference being that orbital fluctuations couple to electrons of both spin .",
    "the absence of any @xmath200 contribution in this non - heisenberg magnon self energy for small @xmath97 implies that the spin stiffness is not renormalized by orbital fluctuations generated by the inter - orbital density interaction @xmath14 . in a multi - orbital ferromagnet , with intra - orbital coulomb interaction @xmath26 , inter - orbital interaction @xmath14 , hund s coupling @xmath22 , and orbital degeneracy @xmath31",
    ", the spin stiffness therefore continues to be essentially determined by the intra - atomic factors @xmath26 , @xmath22 , @xmath31 , through the effective quantum parameter @xmath30/[u + ( { \\cal n}-1)j]^2 $ ] as obtained earlier,@xcite and the interaction @xmath14 does not play an important role .    however , the strong enhancement of magnon self energy near the zone boundary resulted in a strong anomalous magnon softening in the @xmath6-x direction , which increases significantly with hole doping away from quarter filling .",
    "our investigation thus clarifies the completely different roles of interactions @xmath22 and @xmath14 , representing magnetic and charge parts of the inter - orbital coulomb interaction .",
    "while hund s coupling enhances ferromagnetism by strongly suppressing the effective quantum parameter , orbital fluctuations and correlations due to @xmath14 destabilize ferromagnetism by strongly suppressing zone - boundary magnon energies near the orbital ordering instability .    with regard to relative importance of different orbital fluctuation modes ,",
    "staggered fluctuations with @xmath201 near @xmath69 and @xmath99 were found to be most important for the orbital fluctuation magnon self energy .",
    "the spin - orbital coupling magnon self energy was found to be strongly sensitive to orbital fluctuation modes due to an interference between magnetic and charge terms in the interaction vertex .",
    "thus , while the magnetic part showed strong anomalous momentum dependence for orbital modes near @xmath69 , the net contribution to the total vertex was found to be small due to cancellation with the charge term .",
    "rather , fluctuation modes near @xmath0 were found to be important for the total vertex including the charge part .",
    "the strong zone - boundary magnon softening near @xmath202 , arising from staggered orbital fluctuations with @xmath201 near @xmath0 , suggests an instability towards a composite structure of spin - orbital correlations involving period @xmath1 orbital ordering in ferromagnetic planes and intra - orbital af spin correlations in the perpendicular direction .",
    "these results provide a plausible explanation of the observed anomalies in neutron scattering studies of spin - wave excitations in ferromagnetic manganites , where spin stiffness is seen to remain essentially unchanged whereas the zone - boundary magnon softening is enhanced with increasing hole doping and the approach towards ce - type charge - orbital ordered states near @xmath203 .",
    "our results of strong anomalous magnon self energy contribution from different orbital fluctuation modes such as @xmath69 and @xmath0 show the zone - boundary softening to be a more generic feature of spin - orbital coupling . only ferromagnetic orbital correlations extremely close to the orbital ordering instability were found to yield significant magnon softening in earlier studies.@xcite    the observed zone - boundary magnon softening has been usually modeled by including a fourth neighbour interaction term @xmath13.@xcite as @xmath13 yields no contribution to the zone - boundary magnon energy , but contributes significantly to spin stiffness , it must be accompanied by a corresponding reduction @xmath204 in the nn coupling so that the spin stiffness remains unchanged , as observed experimentally ; the net magnon energy reduction then has the non - heisenberg form @xmath205 .",
    "our anomalous magnon self energy result of this form thus provides fundamental insight into the role of orbital fluctuations on magnetic couplings and excitations .    instead of the inter - orbital interaction @xmath206 considered here ,",
    "inter - site interactions @xmath156 would generate similar diagrammatic contributions to the magnon self energy , which become important near the charge - ordering instability where charge excitations become relatively soft , resulting in similar magnon self energy and anomalous zone - boundary magnon softening .",
