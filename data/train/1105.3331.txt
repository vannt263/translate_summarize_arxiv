    "it is well known that if quantum effects are taken into account , a threshold energy scale , over which general relativity looses its validity , emerges .",
    "this threshold is called the planck scale . for the 4-dimensional spacetime ,",
    "the planck energy is defined by @xmath0  gev , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are the speed of light , dirac constant , and newton s gravitational constant , respectively .",
    "the circumferential radius of a spherically symmetric black hole of mass @xmath4 is equal to its reduced compton wavelength @xmath5 , and hence such a black hole will behave as a gravitating quantum object whose behavior is unpredictable in the framework of general relativity .",
    "the planck energy , @xmath6 , is much larger than the electroweak scale ( @xmath7  gev ) , and this fact is recognized as the hierarchy problem in the elementary particle physics .    the large extra - dimension scenario was proposed as a solution for the hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "this scenario is inspired by superstring theories , and in this scenario , the fundamental planck energy , @xmath8 , may be as low as @xmath9  gev scale .",
    "the peculiarity of this scenario is that the length scales of the compactification of extra - dimensions can be much larger than the fundamental planck length @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the gravity can be described by a higher - dimensional classical theory ( e.g. , higher - dimensional general relativity ) for the distance scale smaller than the compactification scale and larger than @xmath11 .",
    "also in this scenario , the classical theory of gravity will loose its validity in the super - planckian domains .    for non - gravitational interactions ,",
    "a length scale ( e.g. , compton wavelength ) , which is usually explored by a particle scattering , decreases with increasing its energy measured at the center of mass frame .",
    "however , this relation may not hold for the phenomena in which gravity plays an important role .",
    "it is widely believed that collisions of particles with the super - planckian energy scale would produce black holes , and hence , physical processes characterized by the length scale shorter than @xmath12 are hidden inside black holes  @xcite .",
    "this is a kind of the cosmic censorship hypothesis for the super - planckian domain , but it is not trivial whether this hypothesis is correct .",
    "the original cosmic censorship hypothesis claims that , roughly speaking , naked singularities are not formed in our universe  @xcite .",
    "however , we have to note that even if the cosmic censorship hypothesis is correct , it does not necessarily imply that the super - planckian physics is hidden inside horizons . in the framework of general relativity or in the large extra - dimension scenario , the super - planckian curvature is not a spacetime singularity as long as it is finite , and thus the presence of the super - planckian domains may be irrelevant to the cosmic censorship",
    ". indeed , nakao , harada , and miyamoto ( nhm ) recently suggested , by a simple dimensional analysis , a possibility that visible super - planckian domains may be produced in high - energy particle collisions , if the spacetime dimension is larger than four  @xcite .    to theoretically explore the phenomena in a higher - dimensional gravity ,",
    "numerical relativity is probably the unique approach . in the past a few years , several implementations for the higher - dimensional numerical relativity have been developed  @xcite , and now , it is feasible to explore the nonlinear physics such as high - velocity collision in higher dimensions as in 4 dimensions  @xcite . in this paper , we numerically show that in a scattering of two black holes in the framework of 5-dimensional ( 5d ) general relativity , super - planckian domains may be indeed visible .",
    "hereafter , we adopt the natural units @xmath13 and the abstract index notation : latin indices except for @xmath14 denote a tensor type and greek indices denote a component with respect to some basis vectors  @xcite . in this paper , we define the fundamental planck energy @xmath8 such that 5d einstein s equation is written as @xmath15",
    "we define a super - planckian domain as a region where 5d general relativity looses its validity . in the case that quantum effects on a spacetime geometry are not very large , quantum corrections to the einstein - hilbert action might be given in the form of scalar polynomials of the riemann tensor .",
    "hence , we adopt the square root of the absolute value of the kretschmann invariant @xmath16 as a reference quantity .",
    "to determine a reasonable threshold value of @xmath16 over which the domain becomes super - planckian , we adopt , as a reference , the 5d schwarzschild - tangherlini ( st ) black hole which is a spherically symmetric vacuum solution in 5d general relativity . by the definition of @xmath8 through eq .",
    "( [ einstein ] ) , the circumferential radius of the st black hole with mass @xmath17 is equal to @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the st black hole with @xmath19 will behave as a gravitating quantum object which actually can not be described by general relativity , because the reduced compton wavelength of this black hole agrees with its circumferential radius .",
    "@xmath16 at the event horizon of this black hole is equal to @xmath20 .",
    "hence , by introducing a dimensionless reference quantity @xmath21 , we can define a super - planckian domain @xmath22 by @xmath23 note that the above condition will be one of sufficient conditions for the appearance of a super - planckian domain , because a domain , in which one of scalar quantities defined from the riemann tensor exceeds an appropriately determined critical value , should be regarded as a super - planckian one  @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we consider a scattering of two non - rotating black holes with identical mass @xmath17 . a procedure for setting initial data of the scattering problem with negligible junk radiation was presented in  @xcite , which we follow .",
    "when the distance between two black holes is much larger than their gravitational radii @xmath24 , the metric near each black hole in each rest frame is well approximated by that of the st black - hole spacetime , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 . to obtain an approximate metric in the vicinity of each black hole in the _ center - of - mass frame _ of the two - black - hole system ,",
    "we perform coordinate transformations for the above metric twice .",
    "first , a boost transformation , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , is performed , where the velocity @xmath33 is a positive constant less than unity , and @xmath34 is the lorentz factor .",
    "next , a spatial translation , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , is performed , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are positive constants , respectively . as a result ,",
    "we obtain two coordinate systems in which the world line of the black hole ( puncture ) is given by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and the line element is @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with @xmath46 . the components of the extrinsic curvature of the spacelike hypersurface labeled by @xmath47 are @xmath48,\\\\ k^\\pm_{xx}&=&k^{\\pm}_{yy}=k^{\\pm}_{zz } = \\mp\\frac{\\gamma v(w\\mp\\ell_w\\pm vt)\\alpha_\\pm\\psi_\\pm'}{b_0\\psi_\\pm r_\\pm } , \\\\ k^\\pm_{wx}&=&\\mp\\frac{\\gamma v(x\\mp\\ell_x)b_\\pm}{r_\\pm}\\left[\\alpha_\\pm '",

    "the zoom - whirl orbit was never found in 5 dimensions in contrast to the 4d case  @xcite , because the law of the gravitational force is modified : note that in the newtonian limit in 5 dimensions , both gravitational and centrifugal forces are proportional to @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the separation of two objects .    for a high velocity with @xmath76 , by contrast , we were not able to determine the value of @xmath68 using our current code .",

    "by contrast , when the separation is equal to 2@xmath89 , a highly elongated domain with a large value of @xmath90 is formed between two black holes [ see fig .",
    "finally , two black holes are scattered away , and the domain with a large value of @xmath83 disappears [ see fig .  2(c ) ] .     at the center of mass as a function of the coordinate separation between two black holes .",

    "the maximum value @xmath94 in the best resolution run is @xmath95 in this scattering process , the event horizons of these black holes do not merge with each other , because these black holes go away toward infinity separately after this scattering .",
    "hence , by the symmetry of this system , the center of mass is not enclosed by the event horizon .",
    "this fact implies that even if each black hole is a classical object before the scattering , a visible super - planckian domain can emerge in the vicinity of the center of mass in 5d general relativity .",

    "the results only for @xmath81 are plotted .",
    "this shows that the maximum value of @xmath100 increases steeply with @xmath33 , and thus , the super - planckian domain appears to be always visible in high - velocity collisions .",
    "this also suggests that for @xmath101 , the maximum value of @xmath100 would be much larger than @xmath102 .",
    "probing the short - distance physics would be limited if scattering processes at energies well above the planck scale were hidden behind a black hole horizon",
    ". if this hypothesis is correct , possible productions of small black holes in particle colliders , such as the cern large hadron collider , could be probably the unique opportunity for exploring the nature of the quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in this paper , a visible super - planckian domain can be generated even through a scattering process of two classical black holes in 5d spacetime .",
    "we may say in the practical sense that the cosmic censorship does not hold in 5d spacetime , because a super - planckian domain should be regarded as an effective singularity in the classical gravity .",
    "the visible super - planckian domain is formed even for @xmath103 , i.e. , in a mildly relativistic scattering , and visible super - planckian domains can be generated through gravitational scatterings more efficiently than a guess by nhm . it should be emphasized that such domain could emerge even in the absence of special spacetime symmetry or special assumption of spacetime geometry .",
    "the present result implies that it is necessary to study quantum gravitational effects in the super - planckian domain of no horizon .",
    "although , at present , we do not know what happens in the super - planckian domain , we expect that the semi - classical particle creation in the sub - planckian region could occur around the visible super - planckian domain  @xcite .    finally , we comment on the scatterings for @xmath104 with @xmath105 for which our numerical simulations do not keep sufficient accuracy probably due to the emergence of a very large spacetime curvature .",
    "we performed simulations for @xmath81 with several grid resolutions .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath83 becomes larger for the finer grid resolution for a given value of @xmath91 .",
    "it also increases with approaching @xmath65 .",
    "these facts suggest that ultra - high spacetime curvature , which is not encompassed in a horizon , may be realized at some impact parameter for @xmath106 , i.e. , the formation of a naked singularity .",
