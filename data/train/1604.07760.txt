    "mhd turbulence in the solar wind is considered to be a cascade of energy over different scales caused by the nonlinear interaction between counterpropagating alfvn waves , which has been studied in detail by asymptotic solution @xcite and numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "the cascade is anisotropic with the cascading direction mainly perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "when the oppositely directed alfvn waves carry unequal energy , the turbulence is imbalanced .",
    "imbalanced weak @xcite and strong @xcite turbulence have been studied intensively . in some theoretical studies , the energy spectrum of the elssser variables ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 )",
    "@xmath15 have a same scaling with different amplitudes .",
    "the scaling is @xmath16 with the phenomenon of dynamic alignment @xcite , while the scaling is @xmath17 without the phenomenon of dynamic alignment @xcite . in the solar wind , especially in fast streams , imbalanced turbulence",
    "is usually observed ( one of @xmath3 is dominating ) .",
    "we define the dominant mode as @xmath8 which is typically the alfvn wave propagating outward from the sun , while the subdominant mode @xmath10 is weak and complicated .",
    "the subdominant mode has been suggested to be inward propagating alfvn wave at high frequency and compressive events at low frequency ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , magnetic structures @xcite .    without temperature anisotropies and relative drifts ,",
    "if the mhd turbulence is only composed of counterpropagating alfvn waves with no nonlinear interaction , the residual energy @xmath18 would be zero . however in the solar wind , outward propagating alfvn waves are often observed , while inward propagating alfvn waves are rarely observed . besides , there are also many structures like tangential discontinuities in the solar wind which may contribute more to the magnetic disturbances than the velocity fluctuations",
    ". these factors would lead to the residual energy being nonzero .",
    "residual energy is high at low frequency / small @xmath19 from observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however it remains unknown whether the residual energy is mainly distributed along @xmath12 or @xmath9 . in the solar wind turbulence ,",
    "the residual energy at small scales near the dissipation range is usually less than 0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is also noted in simulations .",
    "as revealed from recent simulations , the residual energy is concentrated at small @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the residual energy in the wave - vector space will allow us to compare with these simulation results .",
    "the presence of a mean magnetic field may lead to spectral anisotropy of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the anisotropy in a balanced strong mhd turbulence with vanishing cross - helicity , revealing a spectrum perpendicular to the magnetic field of @xmath20 , a parallel spectrum @xmath21 , and a scaling relation @xmath22 based on the critical balance assumption , i.e. , the linear wave periods are comparable to the nonlinear turnover timescales .",
    "the anisotropic power and scaling of magnetic field fluctuations in the inertial range of high - speed solar wind turbulence is first reported by @xcite , who introduced the method to estimate the scale - dependent local @xmath23 .",
    "the reduced spectrum has an index near -2 when @xmath24 and an index near @xmath25 when @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the angle between the magnetic field and the flow .",
    "@xcite gave similar results using magnetic field measurements from the stereo .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also got a similar conclusion for the magnetic structure function .",
    "when the second order structure function of the magnetic fluctuations is decomposed into the components perpendicular ( @xmath28 ) and parallel ( @xmath29 ) to the mean field , both components show spectral index anisotropy between the ion and electron gyroscales in the fast solar wind @xcite . at these small scales",
    "the spectral index of @xmath28 is -2.6 at large angles and -3 or steeper at small angles .",
    "this kind of spectral anisotropy of solar wind turbulence in the inertial range is probably related to the intermittency @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the anisotropy of the elssser variables in fast solar wind based on the reduced spectrum , finding that the dominant elssser mode is isotropic at low frequencies but becomes increasingly anisotropic at higher frequencies while the subdominant mode is anisotropic throughout .",
    "this result suggests that the anisotropy of the subdominant mode may be stronger than the dominant mode .",
    "the spectral anisotropy has been studied extensively based on the reduced spectrum , while the anisotropy in wave - vector space is relatively rarely studied .",
    "the k - filtering method has been applied to the cluster observations to investigate the anisotropy in wave - vector space ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , this method is sensitive only to a limited number of wave modes and the scales comparable to the inter - spacecraft distance @xcite . based on single spacecraft measurements ,",
    "@xcite first constructed the normalized power spectral density ( psd ) of magnetic field fluctuations ( * b * ) in 2d wave - vector space .",
    "they found that the psd of * b * shows an anisotropic distribution , which is mainly characterized by a ridge distribution inclined more toward @xmath9 as compared to @xmath12 .",
    "the spectral anisotropy of velocity and elssser variables in wave - vector space has not been previously investigated .",
    "we will study them in this paper using the method contributed by @xcite .",
    "moreover , we will investigate the distribution of residual energy @xmath30 , alfvn ratio @xmath31 and elssser ratio @xmath32 in the wave - vector space .",
    "to test the conversion between @xmath33 and @xmath34 based on the projection - slice theorem , we first assume a double gaussian distribution , a strong parallel component and a weak perpendicular component , for @xmath33 using the formula given below : @xmath35 based on this assumption , there are three ways to obtain the @xmath34 .",
    "the first way is to get the @xmath34 directly from the corresponding formula : @xmath36 the second way is to do the transformation based on the projection - slice theorem .",
    "firstly , we make the 1 dimensional integration ( 1d - int ) of @xmath33 along the direction ( @xmath37 ) normal to @xmath38 to get 1d - cf at each angle using the following formula : @xmath39 secondly , we calculate the fourier transformation ( ft ) of the 1d - cf to get the corresponding slice of 2d - psd at each angle using the following formula : @xmath40 finally , the @xmath34 is assembled by putting the slices of 2d - psd at each angle together . the third way is to do the two dimensional fourier transformation ( 2d - ft ) of @xmath41 : @xmath42    here , we set @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46",
    ". the origin @xmath33 and the transferred @xmath34 obtained by the three methods above are given in figure  [ fig1 ] . from figure  [ fig1 ] , the @xmath34 obtained by the three different ways are in accordance with each other .",
    "this confirms that the the conversion between @xmath33 and @xmath34 based on the projection - slice theorem is credible .",
    "four fast solar wind streams , with their magnetic field measured by the magnetic field investigation ( mfi ; @xcite ) and particle distribution measured by the three - dimensional plasma analyser ( 3dp ; @xcite ) , are investigated at the time cadence of 3s .",
    "the time intervals for the four fast solar wind streams are from 12:00ut 30 january to 00:00ut 4 february in 1995 ( stream 1 ) , from 06:00ut 17 january to 06:00ut 20 january in 2007 ( stream 2 ) , from 00:00ut 11 february to 12:00ut 14 february in 2008 ( stream 3 ) , from 12:00ut 12 july to 12:00ut 15 july in 2008 ( stream 4 ) , respectively .",
    "the four streams are typical fast streams , with a speed more than 600km@xmath47 , a density roughly 2 - 4@xmath48 , a temperature around 20ev , and a magnetic field about 4 - 6nt .",
    "the transformation from @xmath33 to @xmath34 based on the projection - slice theorem @xcite is applied to @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 to calculate @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "this method yields the relative normalized values ( @xmath57 ) . to get the absolute values , we use the following formula : @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 . @xmath61 and",
    "@xmath62 stand for the lower and upper limit of the frequency range used to calculate the power , respectively . here , @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "are set to @xmath63 and 0.067  hz .",
    "@xmath64 is obtained by the fast fourier transformation of the whole time sequence",
    ". then the residual energy @xmath65 , alfvn ratio @xmath66 and elssser ratio @xmath67 in wave - vector space are investigated consequently .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] displays the spectra @xmath34 of magnetic field * b * ( upper panels ) and velocity * v * ( lower panels ) for the four fast streams .",
    "the spectra @xmath34 of magnetic field * b * behave similar to that obtained by @xcite",
    ". the spectra @xmath34 of * b * for the four fast streams show a similar anisotropic distribution in wave - vector space .",
    "the psd is distributed mainly along a ridge which is inclined toward the @xmath9 axis .",
    "besides the similarity , the distribution of the spectra @xmath34 also shows some difference between different streams .",
    "for example , stream 1 and stream 2 show a component which is aligned with the @xmath9 axis .",
    "we are not currently sure whether the difference between different streams is caused by some underlying physical difference or by the method uncertainty or by both . in the future",
    ", more effort is needed to be done to quantitatively estimate the method uncertainty and distinguish it from the physical signal .",
    "the spectra @xmath34 of velocity * v * show a similar anisotropy pattern as that of magnetic field * b * , suggesting the signature of oblique alfvn waves .    to investigate the spectral anisotropy of elssser variables , the elssser spectra in wave - vector space",
    "are obtained and shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the spectra @xmath34 of @xmath8 and @xmath10 both show anisotropy in the wave - vector space . however , the anisotropy pattern is different for @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "the spectra @xmath34 of @xmath8 share a similar anisotropic pattern with that of magnetic field * b * , and velocity * v * , while the spectra @xmath34 of @xmath10 show a very different anisotropy with the main features of @xmath34 distributed along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the spectra @xmath34 of @xmath10 normalized to the @xmath34 with the same @xmath9 but with @xmath68 ( upper panels in figure  [ fig4 ] ) reveal further evidence that the spectra @xmath34 of @xmath10 is mainly distributed at small @xmath12 .",
    "these results suggest that the anisotropy of the subdominant mode @xmath10 is stronger than that of the dominant mode @xmath8 , which is consistent with the observational result based on the reduced spectrum @xcite and the simulation result @xcite .",
    "the residual energy @xmath4 for all the four fast streams is less than 0 , meaning that the magnetic energy is dominant over kinetic energy .",
    "the residual energy @xmath4 is normalized to @xmath9 axis , using the formula @xmath69 , and shown in the lower panels in figure  [ fig4 ] . as seen from the normalized residual energy @xmath70 , the residual energy @xmath4",
    "is concentrated at small @xmath12 .",
    "this result gives the clear observational support to the simulation results of @xcite and @xcite , which showed a condensate of magnetic energy during cascading of alfven waves due to the breakdown of the mirror symmetry in nonbalanced turbulence .",
    "the distribution of @xmath5 ( upper panels in figure  [ fig5 ] ) and @xmath6 ( lower panels in figure  [ fig5 ] ) both show anisotropy . close to the @xmath9 axis ,",
    "@xmath5 becomes smaller , suggesting that the dominance of magnetic energy over the kinetic energy becomes significant at small @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath6 close to the @xmath9 axis is much larger than at other angles , suggesting that the difference between the energy of @xmath8 and that of @xmath10 is larger close to the @xmath9 axis .",
    "in this paper , we first did a benchmark test of the conversion between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , confirming that the conversion obtained directly from the corresponding formula , by the transformation based on the projection - slice theorem , and by the transformation based on two dimensional inverse fourier are in accordance with each other .",
    "this experiment manifests the applicability of the transformation based on the projection - slice theorem to estimate @xmath34 .",
    "based on the transformation , we investigated the spectral anisotropy of elssser variables in 2d wave - vector space for the first time .",
    "we also studied the distribution of residual energy @xmath4 , alfvn ratio @xmath5 and elssser ratio @xmath6 , which have not been studied in the @xmath7 space before .",
    "four fast streams observed by the wind spacecraft were studied in this work .",
    "the spectra @xmath34 of @xmath51 and @xmath52 both show anisotropy in the wave - vector space . however , the anisotropic pattern of @xmath51 and @xmath52 is different and the anisotropy of @xmath52 seems stronger than that of @xmath51 , which is consistent with the observational result from the reduced spectrum @xcite and the simulation result @xcite .    for each of the four fast streams , the spectra @xmath34 of * b * , *",
    "v * , and @xmath51 share a similar anisotropic pattern as that obtained by @xcite , the spectra @xmath34 is distributed mainly along a ridge which is inclined toward the @xmath9 axis .",
    "this suggests that @xmath51 probably correspond to the oblique alfvnic fluctuations propagating outwardly .    differently from that of * b * , * v * , and @xmath51 , the spectra @xmath34 of @xmath10 is distributed mainly along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the elssser ratio @xmath6 is larger at large @xmath71 angles than at other angles , suggesting that the difference between the spectra @xmath34 of @xmath8 and that of @xmath10 becomes more evident when it is getting close to the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the spectra @xmath34 of @xmath10 normalized to the @xmath34 with the same @xmath9 but with @xmath68 further demonstrates that the power of @xmath10 is concentrated at small @xmath12 .",
    "the alfvn ratio @xmath5 close to the @xmath9 axis is much smaller compared to that at other angles .",
    "if the plasma is thermally anisotropic and component - drifted , the alfvn ratio will be very low , even when @xmath10 stands for the inward propagating alfvn wave .",
    "so , the presence of inward propagating alfvn waves can not be excluded .",
    "if the cascade of @xmath10 is driven by @xmath8 , this may suggest that the cascade is anisotropic and probably mainly along the @xmath9 direction .",
    "the magnetic structure without velocity fluctuations and the non - alfvnic fluctuation with @xmath68 both could lead to the power concentration of @xmath10 and the low alfvn ratio .",
    "further work is required in the future to understand what @xmath10 mostly represents .",
    "though the spectra of * b * and * v * share a similar spectral anisotropic pattern , there are still differences between them as revealed by the anisotropic distribution of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "close to the @xmath9 axis , @xmath5 becomes smaller and @xmath72 becomes larger , suggesting that the dominance of the magnetic energy over the kinetic energy becomes significant .",
    "the residual energy condensate at small @xmath12 confirms observationally the findings in the simulation results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , @xmath10 may be anti - correlated with @xmath8 due to the dominance of magnetic energy over kinetic energy .",
    "the unequipartition between magnetic and kinetic energy may be the case for alfvn waves with kinetic effects if the plasma is thermally anisotropic and component - drifted .",
    "we have tried to re - estimate the spectra @xmath34 of @xmath8 and @xmath10 after correcting for kinetic effects from the thermal anisotropy .",
    "the recalculated distribution of @xmath34 of @xmath8 remain almost unchanged .",
    "however , the @xmath34 of @xmath10 after correcting the thermal anisotropy can not be reconstructed with good quality , which might be due to the possible over - correction of the thermal anisotropy on the weak signal of @xmath10 .    in the critical balance theory of @xcite , the eddies are filament shaped . in simulations",
    "the eddies usually have a ribbon shape @xcite rather than a filament .",
    "@xcite extended critical balance theory to account for this 3d anisotropy .",
    "@xcite investigated the local three dimensional structure functions of the inertial range plasma turbulence based on observation for the first time .",
