    "infotaxis is an olfactory search strategy proposed in 2007 by vergassola , villermaux and shraiman @xcite to address the problem of finding the source of a volatile substance transported in the environment under turbulent or noisy conditions . in the lack of such complications , chemotaxis ,",
    "i.e. moving upwards in concentration gradient , performs well as a search strategy and many living organisms are known to use this strategy to perform their natural tasks . however ,",
    "when detections are scarce or the concentration profile is not smooth , it is no longer possible to estimate the concentration and its gradient at a given point . in this regime , chemotaxis becomes unfeasible and infotaxis reveals its true significance .",
    "some insects are known to navigate and find their targets under these scenarios , @xcite .",
    "learning from their strategies has inspired robotic devices designed to perform complicated search tasks with technological applications ( finding dangerous substances such as drugs or explosives or exploring inhospitable environments ) @xcite , for which robustness and performance of the search is of main concern @xcite .",
    "turbulent or noisy environments are usually modeled by stochastic processes . in the simplest model ,",
    "spatio - temporal correlations in the concentration profile are neglected , and the number of detections is modeled by considering a poisson process at each point of space .",
    "the rate of detections at each point depends on the position of the source and the parameters of the transport process , and is usually obtained from the solution of an advection - diffusion equation .",
    "the searcher agent has a built - in model of the environment , and it is able to calculate the estimated number of detections at its current location , given the position of the source . instead of knowing the true position of the source , the agent uses a probability distribution that expresses his belief about the position of the source .",
    "this belief function is constantly updated following bayesian inference using the built - in model and the number of detections actually registered by the sensors at a given point .",
    "the most innovative feature of infotaxis is the criterion for the motion of the agent : instead of moving towards the most probable position of the source , the agent moves in the direction where it expects to gain more information about its position . in a sense",
    ", it is a greedy search in _ information _ , as opposed to _ physical _ space .",
    "infotactic searches involving fleets of cooperative agents have been considered in @xcite .",
    "extensions of the algorithm to continuous space and time and to three dimensions have been treated in @xcite .",
    "recently , masson has proposed an information based search strategy similar to infotaxis where the searching agent does not have a global space perception , @xcite .    in a previous work ,",
    "@xcite we analyzed the performance of infotaxis as the initial position of the agent relative to the source and the boundary of the search domain was changed .",
    "the surprising result was that the mean search time was not always an increasing function of the distance to the source : in some cases , starting further away from the source led to shorter and more efficient search processes .",
    "this a priori counterintuitive result was explained by the fact that the first step in an infotactic search is not stochastic but deterministic , and depends only on the boundaries of the search domain and the parameters of the transport process ( rate of emission and correlation length ) , not on the position of the source .",
    "this is natural , since at the beginning of the search the agent has no information about the position of the source , the initial belief function is uniform and entropy is maximum .",
    "the search domain was shown to be partitioned into regions of constant first step , and these regions are limited by smooth curves .    in this work",
    "we extend our study of the performance of infotaxis to consider two different situations :    1 .",
    "variation in performance as a function of the environment , assuming perfect knowledge of the environment parameters . 2 .",
    "variation in performance due to an imperfect modeling of the environment .    in the first case",
    "we shall assume that the environment model used by the infotactic agent to do bayesian inference is exact , but we shall probe infotaxis under different ranges of values of the parameters of the environment . in the second case",
    "we will explore the drop in performance caused by an imperfect modeling of the environment , i.e. when there is a mismatch between the true environment parameters and those in use by the agent .",
    "both of these problems are of great practical relevance : it is essential to know the range of parameter values in which infotaxis remains an efficient search strategy , and likewise it is important to know how much uncertainty in the estimation or measurement of the parameters of the transport process can be allowed . while some of these questions have been briefly addressed in the recent literature @xcite , a thorough and systematic analysis as the one performed in this work was absent .",
    "it should be stressed at this point that our implementation of the infotaxis algorithm includes one differential feature from the ones considered in the literature . in previous studies a _ first passage _",
    "criterion was typically used , i.e. the search terminates when the position of the agent coincides for the first time with the position of the source .",
    "instead , we have used a _ first hit _ criterion : the search terminates when the entropy falls below a given threshold , i.e. when the agent has sufficient certainty about the position of the source .",
    "the reason to use this criterion is twofold .",
    "first , the agent needs no external information about the source : it decides to halt based on its own computations and measurements .",
    "second , it allows detection at a distance , i.e. successful searches when the agent knows where the source is , even if it is a distance away from it .",
    "this criterion emphasizes vicinity in the information rather than the spatial sense .",
    "note that with our criterion it could happen that the agent passes on top of the source without actually knowing it , and the search would continue . in practice",
    ", however , it usually happens that when the agent first passes by the source , it decides not to move and entropy rapidly decreases below the threshold signaling the source detection . in some extreme cases as those studied in this work ,",
    "deviations from this standard behavior could happen .    in order to assess the performance of infotaxis as an efficient search strategy",
    ", several measures can be used .",
    "the most obvious one is the _ rate of success _ , which of course involves a proper definition of successful / failed searches .",
    "we shall consider a search to be failed if the search time exceeds an upper bound , or if the maximum of the probability distribution when the entropy falls below the detection threshold does not coincide with the real position of the source .",
    "the next measure of performance is the mean search time , together with its fluctuations .",
    "the motivation of this work is geared towards applications in the development of future sniffers and their use for resolving practical problems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after a brief review of the infotaxis algorithm in section  [ sec : infotaxis ] , we discuss its performance as a function of the parameters of the environment in section  [ sec : param_analisis ] . in section  [ sec : misspecifications ] we perform a quantitative analysis of the drop in performance due to an imperfect modelling of the transport process in the environment .",
    "finally , a discussion of the results is presented in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the infotaxis search algorithm , and refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details and insights ( see also section ii of @xcite ) .",
    "infotaxis was designed as an olfactory search strategy that is able to find the location of a target that is emitting chemical molecules to the environment which is assumed to be turbulent @xcite . by decoding the trace of detections and non detections of such chemicals @xmath0",
    ", the infotactic searcher solves a bayesian inference problem to reconstruct at each time a probabilistic map for the position of the target .",
    "this map , commonly named _",
    "belief function _ in the context of information theory , is refined in time by the searcher by choosing its movements as those that maximize the local gain of information .",
    "a suitable indicator of a successful search is the shannon entropy associated to the belief function , approaching zero when the belief function becomes a delta function located at the position of the target .",
    "the infotaxis search strategy has two key elements : on one hand the average rate of detections @xmath1 , which is a function of the searcher s position @xmath2 and the assumed target s position @xmath3 , and on the other hand the belief function itself @xmath4 .",
    "the rate function @xmath5 models how the the chemicals emitted at a position @xmath3 are transported by the environment , and it is usually taken to be the solution of an advection - diffusion equation in free space @xcite . in two dimensions , the rate function becomes @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the rate of emission of chemicals , @xmath8 is their isotropic effective diffusivity , @xmath9 is the characteristic size of the searcher , @xmath10 is the modified bessel function of order 0 , and @xmath11 the _ correlation length _ , given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the lifetime of the emitted molecules , and @xmath14 the mean current or wind ( which blows , without loss of generality , in the negative @xmath15-direction ) .",
    "the correlation length @xmath11 can be interpreted as the mean distance traveled by a volatile particle before it decays .",
    "the rate function is used by the bayesian inference analysis , weighting the actual number of detections with the expected one , to reconstruct the belief function representing the searcher s knowledge about the target s location .",
    "this function is a time - varying quantity that is updated , given the trace of detections @xmath0 at time @xmath16 , using the bayes formula . if one assumes statistical independence of successive detections ( i.e. a poisson process ) the probability function at time @xmath16 posterior to experiencing a trace @xmath0 is given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the total number of detections registered by the searcher at successive times @xmath20 .",
    "the searcher uses the belief function , choosing its movements not towards the most probable value of @xmath4 but to the position at which the expected gain of information about the target s position is maximized .",
    "assuming that the search domain is a square lattice and quantifying the uncertainty of the searcher about the target s position with the shannon entropy associated to @xmath4 , the maximization process means that the searcher moves from its current position @xmath2 at time @xmath16 to a neighboring position @xmath21 at time @xmath22 , for which the decrease in entropy @xmath23 is largest .",
    "the expected variation of entropy upon moving from @xmath24 to @xmath25 is given by @xmath26\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the probability of having @xmath28 detections during the time @xmath29 , with @xmath30 the mean number of detections at position @xmath25 , and @xmath31 is the expected reduction in entropy assuming that there will be @xmath28 detections during the next movement .",
    "the first and second term in eq .",
    "( [ deltas ] ) evaluate respectively the reduction in entropy if the target is found or not at @xmath21 in the next step .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ deltas ] ) naturally represents a balance between exploitation and exploration .",
    "the numerical experiments reported in the rest of this paper are set as follows : at time @xmath32 the search starts with a uniformly distributed belief function , _",
    "i.e. _ , the searcher is totally ignorant about the target s position .",
    "the initial state is therefore of maximal entropy .",
    "the search ends when the shannon entropy takes a value below a certain threshold , which we set to @xmath33 ( first hitting time criterion ) . during the search the associated entropy approaches zero , not necessarily monotonously , as the belief function gets narrower and under very general circumstances it becomes a delta peak centered at the target s location .",
    "we will show however that this may not always be the case .",
    "this motivates us to distinguish two different situations for an unsuccessful search : when the entropy threshold is reached but the maximum of the belief function does not coincide with the position of the source ( type i ) , and when the search exceeds the maximum time limit @xmath34 without reaching the entropy threshold ( type ii ) .",
    "we first study the dependence of the search time on the different parameters involved in the environment model , namely the diffusion coefficient @xmath8 determining the typical size of the area the searcher agent explores between successive updates of the belief function , the emission rate @xmath7 related to the amount of information the searcher can receive through the detections and the wind speed @xmath14 that breaks the symmetry of the search by distinguishing the regions of the search domain where the target is most likely located .",
    "we recall that changes in @xmath8 and @xmath14 modify the correlation length eq .",
    "[ eq : lambda ] , that roughly speaking , determines the way in which the searcher approaches the target .",
    "naturally , the modification of any of these parameters is reflected on the balance between the explorative and exploitative tendencies of infotaxis @xcite .    to be precise , we consider a search domain consisting on a two - dimensional lattice of size @xmath35 with reflecting boundary conditions , meaning that if at any instant the agent is located on the boundary of the search domain the movement pointing outward is supressed . in the numerical experiments reported in this section , the target",
    "is located at coordinates @xmath36 and the searcher is placed initially at @xmath37 .",
    "all positions are given with respect to the central lattice site @xmath38 of the search domain .",
    "furthermore , we impose that the search starts at time @xmath32 with the searcher having registered one detection .",
    "the size of the searcher is set to @xmath39 and the molecule s life time to @xmath40 .      in this section",
    "we study the variation of the search time with @xmath8 in the absence of wind @xmath41 .",
    "note that with this choice any change in @xmath8 corresponds to a quadratic change in the correlation length @xmath11 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : lambda ] ) .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] , where we can distinguish two different regimes : at small diffusivities the search time decreases two orders of magnitude as @xmath42 , reaching a minimum value at @xmath43 . at larger diffusivities @xmath44 increases and saturates at @xmath45 .",
    "both regimes can be understood simply in terms of the variation of the correlation length @xmath11 . at small diffusivities",
    "the correlation length is small , meaning that the effective area inside which the bayesian inference has an effect is small compared to the whole domain .",
    "as @xmath8 increases @xmath11 increases and the search becomes more effective as this implies an increase of the effective region where the searcher explores to find the source s position , enhancing the searcher s `` field of vision '' . for @xmath46",
    "the correlation length becomes of the same order of the length of the domain ( @xmath47 ) , and the minimum search time is attained . at this point",
    "the exploitative terms in infotaxis become important . at the second regime where the correlation length becomes larger than the search domain the infotactic search looses resolution as larger values of @xmath11",
    "entail further uncertainty about the source position , and the search time increases again and saturates .",
    "in the presence of wind @xmath48 , the same qualitative behaviour is expected .",
    ", obtained as an average over @xmath49 trajectories .",
    "the different symbols identify the direction of the initial step the searcher takes at time @xmath50 : circle ( down ) , square ( left / right ) and diamond ( up ) .",
    "the error bars correspond to the data s standard deviation .",
    "the rest of the parameters were set to @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath41.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it is interesting to note that the fluctuations around the search time also have a different behaviour in these two regimes .",
    "the behaviour of the fluctuations was recently studied in @xcite , and associated to the direction of the initial step taken by the searcher .",
    "there it was found that the initial step in infotaxis is fully determined by the geometry of the boundary and by the searcher s proximity to it , forming a partition with elements of similar initial behaviour .",
    "more importantly , the area and shape of the elements of the partition was mainly affected by the value of the correlation length .",
    "therefore , for a fixed initial position of the searcher , a variation in @xmath11 might change its initial step and the different symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] distinguish this initial behaviour .",
    "the increase of fluctuations around the search time in the regime of large diffusivity is in agreement with our previous findings in @xcite .",
    "we now turn our attention to the dependence of the search time on the wind speed @xmath14 .",
    "we show this in fig .",
    "[ fig : v ] for two different starting positions of the searcher : @xmath37 ( solid symbols ) corresponding to a searcher starting inside the region of frequent detections and @xmath54 ( empty symbols ) at which the searcher is in a region of low detections .",
    "the presence of wind breaks the radial symmetry of the search and more importantly , changes the correlation length @xmath11 .",
    "this will affect not only the mean search time but its fluctuations as discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the search time does not seem to change much with the variation of the wind speed .",
    "moreover , we observe that the dependence of @xmath44 on the wind speed is qualitatively the same irrespectively of the starting position of the searcher .     for two different starting positions of the searcher : @xmath55 ( solid symbols ) @xmath56 ( empty symbols ) .",

    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]      larger emission rates mean that the source emits more information about its presence to the environment , which in turns implies that the searcher will have more information about the source .",
    "this is what we observe in fig.[fig : gamma ] , where the search time decreases with increasing emission rate @xmath7 , independently of the magnitude of the wind .",
    "interestingly , we find that at large emission rates @xmath58 , the search last less at zero wind than in the presence of it . at first sight",
    "this appears counterintuitive since the presence of wind acts as an additional source of information about the direction in which the source is located .",
    "however , we have found that these longer search times in the regime of large @xmath7 are due to the additional time the searcher spends during the initial explorative zigzagging motion when it is far from the source and the detections are scarce . in the absence of wind",
    "the searcher tends to move directly to the center of the domain , thus closer to the source and to the region in which the detections are more frequent .     for @xmath59 ( solid symbols ) and @xmath60 ( empty symbols ) .",

    "[ deltas ] requires to truncate the infinite sum corresponding to the weighted probability of having any possible number of detections during the searcher motion from @xmath24 to @xmath61 .",
    "we do this by summing all terms until the cumulative probability of @xmath28 detections reaches a value close to @xmath62 ( @xmath63 in our computations ) .",
    "however , at high emission rates the mean number @xmath28 of detections increases drastically , demanding a much larger number of terms to consider in the infinite sum , entailing an important increase of the computational cost . to keep the infotaxis computationally efficient",
    "we have approximated the entropy variation of eq .",
    "[ deltas ] by truncating the infinite sum to a maximum number of detections @xmath64 , irrespectively of the value of the cumulative probability @xmath65 , and found some interesting aspects of the infotatic search that we discuss now .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : maps_gamma ] we show the density of visited sites of the trajectories that lead to a successful search in the absence ( upper row ) and presence ( lower row ) of wind .",
    "surprinsingly , under this approximation we observe that the belief function peaks exactly at the source even thugh the searcher never reaches the source position but get stucks away of it .",
    "this is evidenced in the density of visited sites in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : maps_gamma ] . as a matter of fact",
    ", we have found that the searcher remains for long times over the density curve corresponding to @xmath72 . in this region",
    "the agent feels a number of detections that would correspond to be very close to the source , thus changing from an explorative search to an exploitative one , emphasizing a major contribution of the first term of eq.[deltas ] in the decision making processs .",
    "this is evidenced by comparing the highest density of visited sites on the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : maps_gamma ] with the shape of the corresponding mean concentration field that we show in the left column of the same figure . notwithstanding this ,",
    "the bayesian inference continue to refine the belief function by making the probabilistic triangulation from a distance , until it becomes a peaked distribution over the source position .",
    "this surprising effect stresses one of the most important sources of the robustness of the infotaxis search strategy : the location of the source is possible even if the searcher never reaches its position .",
    "in this section we focus on the performance of infotaxis , as measured by the success rate and mean search time , when the searcher does not have an exact knowledge of the parameters of the transport process .",
    "it is natural to expect a drop of perfomance in this regime , but we are interested in a quantitative analysis .",
    "it is hard to overemphasize how important this matter is for practical purposes , as measuring devices introduce some uncertainty in the best case , and other parameters that are harder to measure can only be estimated .",
    "we begin our performance analysis with the misspecification in the correlation length parameter @xmath11 , fig.[fig : fpt_d_est ] .",
    "we recall that @xmath11 is defined in , so we will keep the rest of the parameters constant and let the diffusion coefficient @xmath8 change .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath73 the diffusion coefficient used by the searcher for his bayesian inference and @xmath74 the true diffusivity of the transport process ( and likewise for the rest of the parameters ) .",
    "our results ( see figure [ fig : fpt_d_est ] ) show that for @xmath75 the performance of infotaxis is largely unaffected by the mismatch : the sucess rate is close to @xmath76 and the mean search time is close to the case of perfect knowledge . as in the previous section , when @xmath77 , the searcher assumes that the information collected during the search process comes from a region larger than it really is , causing a slower learning to find the source position and thereby , a larger search time .",
    "however , such increase in the search time is hardly observed in this case due to the dilute conditions of the search and the particular starting position of the searcher chosen for the numerical simulations ( its first step at low detection rate is persistently directed towards the source ) .",
    "however , an underestimation of @xmath11 causes a drastic drop in performance .",
    "this is specially evident when @xmath78 is less than or of the order of the initial distance of the agent to the boundary of the search domain . in these cases ,",
    "the initial step of the search changes and the search time increases because the searcher explores the space and learns about the source position in steps smaller than it should .",
    "we should remark that all the unsuccessful searches occur when @xmath11 is underestimated and they correspond to type i failures : the maximum of the belief function when the entropy threshold is reached does not coincide with the true position of the source .    .",

    "it is worth stressing that while the other parameters of the transport process , such as the diffusivity an the wind velocity can be measured with appropriate equipment , the rate of emission of volatile particles that are transported by the medium is harder to measure and subject to greater variability , e.g. if infotaxis is used by a robotic agent to find the source of a plague in a crop field , the emission rate of volatiles will depend on the biological state of the infected plant @xcite .",

    "[ fig : success_gamma_est ] is that , as opposed to the results exhibited in section [ sec : param_analisis ] , the search is not always successful .",

    "the reason of this increase in mean search time is a deficient bayesian inference , as the agent believes the source to be farther away or much closer than it really is for a given rate of detection . in other words",

    "we have shown , in accordance with the previous literature , that the search time shows strong dependence not only of the initial step of the search , but also in the way in which the searcher explores the environment ( mainly determined by the correlation length @xmath11 ) and exploits the information collected during the search process . in the case of a perfect knowledge of the environment , we find that the searches are always successful but the mean search time changes with the parameters of the transport process . as a function of the correlation length @xmath11 , the mean search time reaches a minimum value when @xmath11 has the size of the search domain .",
    "the dependence of the mean search time of the wind velocity is very mild as well as its dependence on the initial position of the agent relative to the source and wind direction . the mean search time decreases with emission rate @xmath7 , as information is released to the agent at a higher rate",
    ". however , at very high @xmath7 the computational complexity of the algorithm increases , and we have found that simplifying the computation still leads to succesful searches even when the agent never reaches the source .",
    "we have studied the drop in performance of infotaxis caused by an imperfect modelling of the environment expressed through an inaccurate estimation of the parameters of the transport process .",
    "our results show that in practical cases it is safer to overestimate the correlation length @xmath11 than to underestimate it , as in the former case no significant drop in performance occurs while in the latter the sucess rate quickly drops .",
    "the situation is different when the mismatch between real and estimated value occurs for the emission rate @xmath7 . in this case",
    "there is a window around the real value where infotaxis remains robust , but overestimation or underestimation by a factor of two leads to a rapid decay in performance , with lower success rates and higher mean search times .",
    "our results places some limits on the performance of infotaxis , and have practical consequences for the design of future infotaxis based machines to track and detect an emitting source of chemicals or volatile substances .    this work has been supported by grant no .",
