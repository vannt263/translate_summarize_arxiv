    "the corresponding damping timescales involve the shear and bulk viscosities of neutron star interior .",
    "both viscosities depend on density , temperature and composition of dense matter",

    "viscous damping of pulsations of newly born hot neutron stars turns out to be due to the bulk viscosity .",
    "another role of the viscosity of neutron star matter is that it can damp gravitational radiation driven instabilities in rotating neutron stars and , therefore , could be important for determination of the maximum rotation frequency of neutron stars . in the absence of viscosity all rotating neutron stars",
    "would be driven unstable by the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "viscous damping timescales enter explicitly the criteria for the appearance of these instabilities .",
    "similarly , as in pulsating non - rotating neutron stars , viscous damping of gravitational radiation driven instabilities in rapidly rotating newly born neutron stars is dominated by bulk viscosity of neutron star interiors ( e.g. , lindblom @xcite , zdunik 1996 , lindblom et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper , we focus on the viscosity of matter in the neutron star cores ( which extend from the layers of density @xmath0 g @xmath1 to the stellar centers ) .",
    "it is well known that the cores consist of baryons ( neutrons @xmath2 , protons @xmath3 and possibly hyperons ) and leptons ( electrons @xmath4 and muons @xmath5 ) .",
    "all constituents of matter are strongly degenerate fermions .",
    "the electrons and muons form almost ideal fermi gases .",
    "the electrons are ultrarelativistic while the muons may be non - relativistic or relativistic depending on density .",
    "the nucleons are , to a good approximation , non - relativistic and constitute strongly interacting fermi liquid . at the densities close to the normal nuclear density ( baryon number density @xmath6 @xmath7 which corresponds to the mass density @xmath8 g @xmath1 ) , neutron star matter is composed of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . at higher densities [ @xmath9@xmath10 some models of dense matter predict appearance of hyperons . at still higher densities ,",
    "some calculations indicate possible presence of exotic phases ( pion condensate , kaon condensate , deconfined quark matter ) .",
    "we will not consider the hyperonic or exotic phases but restrict ourselves to the study of the @xmath11 matter .",
    "our analysis is additionally complicated by possible superfluidity of nucleons in the neutron star cores .",
    "the superfluidity is thought to be produced by cooper pairing of nucleons due to attractive parts of nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the superfluidity of nucleons in the neutron star cores has been the subject of numerous papers ( as reviewed , for instance , by yakovlev et al .",
    "various microscopic theories predict very different superfluid gaps ( critical temperatures @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) of neutrons and protons depending on specific model of strong interaction employed and specific many - body theory used to account for medium effects .",
    "however , all these results have important common features . in particular",
    ", the proton pairing occurs mainly in the @xmath14s@xmath15-state since the @xmath16 interaction is attractive in this state everywhere in the neutron star core due to not too high number density of protons . as for the neutrons ,",
    "their interaction in the @xmath14s@xmath15 state turns from attraction to repulsion at densities @xmath17 but the interaction in the @xmath18p@xmath19 state may be attractive and may lead to cooper pairing . the critical temperatures @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the neutron star cores predicted by different microscopic theories depend on density and scatter in a wide range from about @xmath20 to @xmath21 k. under these conditions we will not rely on any specific microscopic theory of nucleon superfluidity , but will treat @xmath12 and @xmath13 as free parameters .    the viscosity , we are interested in , is well known to consist of the shear viscosity and bulk viscosity .",
    "the standard source of the shear viscosity of the neutron star matter is scattering between its constituents .",
    "classical calculations of shear viscosity for the @xmath22 model of non - superfluid matter were done by flowers & itoh ( @xcite ) .",
    "their results were used in the studies of damping of neutron star pulsations by cutler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . in the superfluid core of a rotating neutron star ,",
    "there is an additional viscous mechanism , called mutual friction , resulting from the scattering of electrons off the magnetic field trapped in the cores of superfluid neutron vortices ( lindblom & mendell @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk viscosity may partly be determined by particle scattering .",
    "however , this component of bulk viscosity is usually much smaller than the shear viscosity ( e.g. , baym & pethick @xcite ) .",
    "the main contribution into the bulk viscosity of sufficiently hot @xmath11 matter comes from the neutrino processes of urca type associated with electron and muon emission and capture by nucleons .",
    "we will focus on such bulk viscosity .",
    "generally , the neutrino processes in question are divided into the _ direct urca _ and the _ modified urca _ processes .",
    "a direct urca process is a sequence of two reactions ( direct and inverse one ) and can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is either electron or muon , and @xmath25 is an associated neutrino .",
    "the most important is the process ( lattimer et al .",
    "@xcite ) involving electrons ( @xmath26 ) ; it consist of the beta decay of neutron and subsequent beta capture . it should be emphasized that the both direct urca processes are forbidden by momentum conservation of reacting particles for the simplest model of dense matter as a gas of noninteracting fermi particles ( e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky @xcite ) at any density @xmath27 in the neutron star cores .",
    "nevertheless they are allowed ( lattimer et al .",
    "@xcite ) for some realistic equations of state at densities higher than some threshold densities ( of several @xmath28 ) .",
    "thus , the direct urca processes may be open in the inner cores of rather massive neutron stars .",
    "the threshold density for the muon process is always higher than for the electron one .",
    "if allowed , the direct urca processes produce the most powerful neutrino emission from the neutron star cores ( lattimer et al .",
    "corresponding neutrino emissivities were calculated by lattimer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and used in numerous simulations of the neutron star cooling as reviewed , for instance , by yakovlev et al .  ( @xcite ) .",
    "in the absence of nucleon superfluidity , the direct urca processes lead to the _ fast _ cooling of neutron stars . if allowed , the direct urca processes produce the main contribution into the bulk viscosity we are interested in .",
    "however , for many equations of state the direct urca processes are forbidden by momentum conservation at any density in the neutron star cores .",
    "moreover , they are prohibited at @xmath29 for the majority of equations of state . in such cases",
    ", they do not operate in the low and medium - mass neutron stars and in the outer cores of all neutron star models constructed using these equations of state .",
    "if so , the bulk viscosity is determined by the the reactions of the modified urca processes @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an additional nucleon required to conserve momentum of the reacting particles .",
    "for instance , in @xmath22 matter one has two modified urca processes corresponding to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , which can be referred to as the neutron and proton branches of the modified urca process ( e.g. , friman & maxwell @xcite , yakovlev & levenfish @xcite ) . the rates of the modified urca processes are typically 35 orders of magnitude lower than the rates of the direct urca processes .",
    "the modified urca processes either have no density threshold ( as the neutron branch in @xmath22 matter ) or have much lower density thresholds than the direct urca processes .",
    "thus they operate in the entire neutron star core .",
    "if the direct urca processes are forbidden and matter is non - superfluid , the modified urca processes produce the main neutrino emission from the neutron star cores leading to _ slow _ ( _ standard _ ) cooling of neutron stars .",
    "their role in the neutron star cooling theory has been studied in many papers ( see , e.g. , yakovlev et al .",
    "@xcite , for review ) .",
    "thus , the problem of calculating the bulk viscosity due to neutrino processes is quite complicated : there are several neutrino processes involved influenced by possible nucleon superfluidity .",
    "so far the bulk viscosity has been studied only for non - superfluid @xmath22 matter .",
    "the viscosity due to the neutron branch of the modified urca process was analyzed by sawyer ( @xcite ) while the viscosity produced by the nucleon direct urca process was considered by haensel & schaeffer ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of superfluidity have not been analyzed for the problem of bulk viscosity but studied thoroughly for the neutrino emissivity produced in different reactions ( e.g. , yakovlev et al .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the relative importance of the bulk viscosity produced by neutrino reactions with respect to the shear viscosity produced by collisions can be estimated by comparing the results by sawyer ( @xcite ) and haensel & schaeffer ( @xcite ) with the values of the shear viscosity calculated by flowers & itoh ( @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison shows that the neutrino bulk viscosity dominates in the neutron star cores for temperatures @xmath34 k if the direct urca processes are switched on and for @xmath35 k if the direct urca processes are forbidden . in superfluid matter",
    ", the bulk viscosity can be even more important .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the bulk viscosity produced by the direct urca processes in @xmath11 matter of the neutron star cores .",
    "in analogy with the effects of superfluidity on the neutrino emissivity , we will analyze the effects of superfluidity of nucleons on the bulk viscosity .",
    "consider the bulk viscosity produced by the direct urca process ( involving muons and electrons ) in non - superfluid @xmath11 matter .    due to very frequent collisions between particles , dense stellar matter should very quickly ( instantaneously on macroscopic time scales ) achieve a quasi - equilibrium state with certain temperature @xmath36 and chemical potentials @xmath37 of different particle species @xmath38 .",
    "typically , all particle species are strongly degenerate .",
    "we assume that the matter is transparent for neutrinos , which therefore do not contribute to the thermodynamical quantities .",
    "a quasi - equilibrium state described above does not mean full thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the latter assumes additionally the equilibrium with respect to the beta and muon decay and capture processes .",
    "we will call it the _ chemical equilibrium_. relaxation to the chemical equilibrium depends drastically on a given equation of state and local density of matter @xmath27 .",
    "it is realized either through direct urca or modified urca processes ( sect .  1 ) .",
    "consideration of this subsection is valid for all urca processes although the practical expressions ( sects .",
    "2.3  2.4 ) will be obtained for the direct urca processes .    the urca processes of both types , direct and modified ,",
    "are rather slow .",
    "although the chemical relaxation rate depends strongly on temperature , in any case it takes much more time ( from tens of seconds to much longer time intervals ) than the rapid relaxation to a quasi - equilibrium state described above .",
    "therefore , a neutron star can be in a quasi - equilibrium , but not in the chemical equilibrium , for a long time .",
    "if the chemical equilibrium is achieved , then the chemical potentials satisfy the equalities @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which imply @xmath41 . under these conditions , the rates of the direct and inverse reactions , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath24 = @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) , of any urca process are equal .",
    "let us assume that the neutron star undergoes radial pulsations of frequency @xmath44 .",
    "associated temporal variations of the local baryon number density will be taken in the form @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the pulsation amplitude and @xmath47 is the non - perturbed baryon number density ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we assume further that @xmath47 corresponds to the chemical equilibrium .",
    "this chemical equilibrium is violated slightly in pulsating matter .",
    "if the pulsation frequency @xmath44 were much smaller than the chemical relaxation rates , the composition of matter would follow instantaneous values of @xmath49 , realizing the chemical equilibrium every moment of time .    in reality , the typical frequencies of the fundamental mode of the radial pulsations @xmath50@xmath51  s@xmath52 , are much higher than the chemical relaxation rates . as a result ,",
    "the partial fractions @xmath53 of all the constituents of dense matter are almost unaffected by pulsations ( i.e. , almost constant ) .",
    "owing to the slowness of the urca reactions , these fractions lag behind their instantaneous equilibrium values , producing non - zero differences of instantaneous @xmath37 : @xmath54 this causes an asymmetry of the direct and inverse direct urca reactions , and , hence , slight deviations from the chemical equilibrium .",
    "the asymmetry , calculated in the _ linear approximation _ with respect to @xmath55 , is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the coefficients specified in sect .",

    "our definition of @xmath57 is the same as was used by sawyer ( @xcite ) for the case of @xmath22 matter .",
    "notice that @xmath57 defined in this way is negative .",
    "the non - equilibrium urca reactions provide the energy dissipation which causes damping of stellar pulsations .",
    "accordingly , they contribute to the bulk viscosity of matter , @xmath61 . using the standard definition of the bulk viscosity ,",
    "the energy dissipation rate per unit volume averaged over the pulsation period @xmath62 can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the hydrodynamic velocity associated with the pulsations .",
    "the latter equality is obtained from continuity equation for baryons , @xmath65 ( pulsations do not change their total number ) , which yields @xmath66 .    the hydrodynamic matter flow implied by the stellar pulsations is accompanied by the time variations of the local pressure , @xmath67 .",
    "the dissipation of the energy of the hydrodynamic motion is due to irreversibility of the periodic compression - decompression process .",
    "averaged over the pulsation period , this dissipation rate in the unit volume is @xmath68 for a strictly reversible process , @xmath69 .",
    "however , in our case the quantities @xmath70 and @xmath71 follow variations of @xmath49 in different ways .",
    "the specific volume @xmath72 varies instantaneously as @xmath49 varies , i.e. , the oscillations of @xmath71 and @xmath49 are in phase but the pressure varies with certain phase shift . in @xmath11 matter at quasi - equilibrium the pressure can be regarded as a function of four variables : @xmath49 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath36 .",
    "variations of @xmath36 are insignificant , for our problem , and may be disregarded .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to assume that @xmath75 .",
