    "optical probes of the axion - like particle ( alp ) parameter space , such as polarimetric measurements or  light - shining - through - walls ",
    "setups , are enhanced by applying strong external ( electro-)magnetic fields @xmath0 over a large spatial extent @xmath1 .",
    "conventionally , dipole magnets are used to modify the propagation of probe beams .",
    "but with the remarkable increase in available laser intensity over the past years , multi - terawatt laser systems have become competitive with dipole magnets in providing @xmath2 and can be expected to eventually exceed them .",
    "still , the limited temporal and spatial extent of pulsed high - intensity beams disfavors standard setups used for alp search and requires different observables which are particularly useful for purely laser - based experiments .",
    "such an observable can , e.g. , be a diffraction pattern @xcite , or a frequency shift @xcite .",
    "the latter will be the subject of this contribution .",
    "as we are interested in the effects of the nonlinear interaction of laser photons due to the presence of an axion or alp , we start from the equations of motion for the two fields : @xmath3 for the following discussion , we split the field strength tensor @xmath4 into contributions of a probe field @xmath5 and two external high - intensity beams @xmath6 , and linearize in the probe field . coupling to the first external beam in eq . , the probe photons can be converted into alps , denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "successively , by means of eq . , the alps can be reconverted into photons through the second external field . for simplicity",
    ", the following discussion will be limited to a one - dimensional setup where the probe photons propagate along the positive @xmath8 axis .",
    "then , the above equations of motion can be solved using a green s function approach @xcite .    in order to motivate the findings for a purely laser - based setup we first review the probe photon dynamics for static or slowly varying external fields spanning a length @xmath1 as e.g. provided by a dipole magnet . in this case , employing an incoming plane wave probe beam of frequency @xmath9 in eq .",
    "yields via eq . an outgoing wave that carries the original frequency @xmath9 after the intermediate propagation as an alp , necessitating the use of a light - blocking wall or polarimetric measurements .",
    "in addition , the outgoing wave s amplitude picks up two factors of @xmath10 with @xmath11 arising in the conversion and back - conversion processes , respectively , causing it to be maximal at @xmath12 . from this",
    "it follows that the alp search with dipole magnets is most sensitive for small alp masses , cf .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] .    from another perspective",
    ", the sensitivity for small axion masses being maximal is related to momentum conservation as reflected by the requirement @xmath12 for both the photon - axion conversion and back - conversion process .",
    "r0.6        from the preceding consideration it becomes obvious that employing lasers as external fields will modify the momentum balance as they carry a further frequency scale .",
    "this changes the sensitivity characteristics with respect to the alp mass .",
    "moreover , in accordance with energy conservation , the frequency of the outgoing photon will in general be modified .",
    "this happens in close analogy to the processes of sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) and difference - frequency generation ( dfg ) known from nonlinear optics .",
    "the frequency of the outgoing electromagnetic wave will be the sum or difference of the incident frequencies and , analogous to the phase matching conditions within sfg and dfg , the wave vectors of the external beams ( being different in general ) enter the requirements will be substituted by the natural spatial extent of gaussian beams , being the waist size @xmath13 and the rayleigh length @xmath14 of the beams . ]",
    "@xmath12 . in summary",
    ", we thus suggest the measurement of a frequency shift @xmath15 of probe beam photons as an observable of photon - alp interaction , which is feasible for unsuppressed interaction amplitudes , i.e. @xmath12 for the conversion and back - conversion process .",
    "this perfectly accommodates the features of the high - intensity beam making the use of a light - blocking wall or polarimetric measurements superfluous . with hindsight ,",
    "we choose a configuration in which the photon - axion conversion is mediated by an external beam of frequency @xmath16 propagating orthogonally to the @xmath8 axis , while the back - conversion process from the alp to a photon is due to a counter - propagating beam with @xmath17 , cf .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .    then , as within sfg and dfg , one obtains from eq .",
    "alp partial waves carrying frequencies @xmath18 , while the corresponding ` phase matching condition ' becomes @xmath19 with @xmath20 in case of transmission and reflection of the alp wave , respectively .",
    "above , @xmath21 is realized in the case of transmission ( i.e. @xmath22 ) for @xmath23 , whereas @xmath24 can not satisfy the requirement of a non - negative alp frequency @xmath25 .",
    "thus , only the ` sfg solution ' @xmath26 is kept in the following .",
    "note that , since the wave vector of the external @xmath27 beam has no component along @xmath8 , it does not enter _ explicitly _ in the momentum conservation in eq . .",
    "this is different for the back - conversion process mediated by the @xmath28 beam .",
    "the outgoing electromagnetic partial waves now carry frequencies @xmath29 , whilst momentum conservation requires that @xmath30 as argued above , eqs . and have to hold simultaneously for a feasible sensitivity while we demand @xmath31 as an observable for the photon - alp conversion . requiring positivity of all frequencies",
    ", it can be checked that this is only possible for dfg and transmission of the wave , i.e. @xmath32 in eq . .",
    "in particular , choosing @xmath33 , we see that @xmath34 for axion masses @xmath35 yielding @xmath36 .",
    "this constitutes an observable of the alp - photon interaction ) oriented field and back - conversion can be due to the counter - propagating ( @xmath28 ) field as the interaction order is not assessable for synchronized pulses . the conversion process with the opposite order @xmath37 results in @xmath38 for axion masses around @xmath39 and @xmath33 , thus defining a second resonant mass besides @xmath40 @xcite . ] . as the resonant masses @xmath41 and @xmath42 are of the same order of magnitude as the laser frequency scales being @xmath43 , purely laser - based searches are _ complementary _ to standard dipole setups",
    "of course , to facilitate the detection of the frequency shift requires @xmath44 to lie feasibly outside the spectral widths @xmath45 of all interacting beams .",
    "at last , it is worth emphasizing that the condition @xmath33 is in fact an enormous experimental advantage since second harmonic generation is a standard technique even for high - intensity lasers , thus requiring the employment of only _",
    "one _ external high - intensity beam .",
    "an estimate of the alp discovery potential for purely laser - based searches is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] , see @xcite for details . here , the black wedge - like curves and the black line correspond to a feasible setup at ioq @xcite employing the multi - tw class laser jeti as probe and the pw class laser polaris as external beam , which could be realized in the near future . for the estimate , single - photon detection",
    "is assumed for the frequency - shifted photons can be increased ( @xmath46 per day at ioq @xcite ) . ] .",
    "the wedge - like structures of the bounds around @xmath41 and @xmath42 are a consequence of the fixed frequencies within the setup .    using optical parametric amplification ( opa ) for the probe beam , a larger range of the mass - coupling plane can be explored , as indicated by the black line .",
    "however , as opa limits intensity , the sensitivity to the alp coupling is decreased .",
    "nevertheless , we see that a setup at ioq could provide the strongest model - independent @xcite bounds for alp masses at @xmath47 .",
    "even smaller alp coupling values can potentially be probed at the future exawatt class facility eli @xcite . already with single shot measurements it can be possible to almost complement the currently best laboratory bounds provided by alps @xcite in the @xmath47 mass range as shown by",
    "the red dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] . in order to surpass even the cast @xcite bounds on solar axions",
    ", one would require @xmath48 at eli ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "this constitutes a rather ambitious aim , but would allow for a direct probe of the qcd axion parameter space ( given as a yellow band in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] ) , making it a worthwhile task for the future .",
    "the rapid increase in available laser intensity strongly suggests to investigate the potential of high - intensity lasers for axion and alp search .",
    "as argued , a possible observable in this context is the measurement of a probe beam frequency shift .",
    "this is particularly useful since the limited temporal and spatial extent of the pulses disfavors conventional setups such as polarimetric measurements and light - shining - through - walls . in summary ,",
    "high - intensity probes of alps can constitute a new tool in the general quest @xcite for weakly interacting slim particles .",
