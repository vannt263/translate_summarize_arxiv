    "magneto - phonon resonance in these systems are pronounced because ( i ) they are gapless and low energy direct ( @xmath4 ) electronic excitations exist , and ( ii ) because of the kohn anomaly  @xcite at the @xmath3 point of the phonon brillouin zone which makes phonon energies _ ultra sensitive _ to modifications of the electronic excitation spectrum .",

    "this experimental setup can host various optical filters which are used to filter the excitation laser light at the output of the mono mode fiber ( laser line filter ) , to selectively reflect the excitation laser and transmit the scattered signal ( dichroic mirror ) , to reject the scattered laser before the collection fiber ( notch filter ) , and to impose a circular polarization ( linear polarizers and quarter wave plate ) .",

    "this low value of the magnetic field for the onset of magneto - oscillations is an indication that the carrier density in this sample is lower than half of the @xmath20 phonon energy .",
    "the resonant values of the magnetic field are different in the two polarization configurations , @xmath25 in the @xmath26 configuration and @xmath27 in the @xmath24 configuration",
    ". moreover , the electron - phonon coupling appears to be more efficient at particular values of the magnetic field ( indicated above by the bold typeface ) where the amplitude of the observed oscillation is enhanced with respect to other resonant magnetic fields .",
    "this nontrivial behavior is different from the one observed for epitaxial graphene , for graphene - like domains on the surface of bulk graphite or for k - point carriers in bulk graphite , where the amplitude of the oscillations was found to increase with the magnetic field as the effective electron - phonon coupling strength depends on the degeneracy of the landau levels which increases linearly with  @xmath28 .    to determine the number of landau level fan charts contributing to the observed magneto - phonon resonance",
    ", we extract from the spectra presented in figure  [ fig3]a and in figure  [ fig4]a the evolution of the amplitude of the scattered light at the phonon energy at @xmath29 as a function of the inverse magnetic field .",
    "this quantity shows oscillations which are representative of the phonon oscillations : each time the phonon feature splits or is shifted due to the resonant interaction with an electronic excitation , the amplitude of the scattered light at the phonon energy at @xmath29 decreases .",
    "this evolution is presented in figure  [ fig4]b .",
    "it is then possible to numerically calculate the fourier transform of this signal , presented in figure  [ fig4]c , which shows two distinct frequencies at about 21 and 49  t , corresponding to two periods @xmath30 of about @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "their appearance can be understood qualitatively using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the electronic spectrum of a @xmath33-layer graphene .",
    "namely , the spectrum is similar to that of a bulk graphite , but instead of the continuous quantum number  @xmath8 , @xmath34 ( the wave vector , perpendicular to the layers , in the units of the inverse interlayer spacing ) , only @xmath35 ( for @xmath33 even ) or @xmath36 ( for @xmath33 odd ) discrete values , @xmath37 or @xmath38 , respectively , are allowed .",
    "now , instead of a continuum of inter - landau - level excitations for all  @xmath8 in graphite , which couple to the phonon  @xcite , in the 4-layer graphene one has two series of inter - landau - level excitations , corresponding to the two allowed values of  @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the presence of two periods indicated that our sample has either three or four layers .    in the two - band approximation for the effective bilayer model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the values of the magnetic field @xmath39 at which the magnetophonon resonance occurs , are determined by @xmath40 where @xmath41  is the fermi velocity in the monolayer , and @xmath42 is the nearest - neighbor inter - layer matrix element .",
    "approximating @xmath43 , we obtain @xmath44 the coefficient in front of  @xmath6 thus gives the period @xmath30 for each value of  @xmath8 .",
    "for the monolayer - type spectrum at @xmath45 , the same consideration ( again , approximating @xmath43 ) gives @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 solving this equation brings an inverse period of 7.1  t , which is too small compared to the smallest observed 21  t. thus , we exclude the possibility that our sample could be a trilayer graphene . for four layers",
    ", we have @xmath49 , which , for @xmath50 , gives two frequencies of 16 and 41  t. this is an indication that the sample has four layers .    to give more solid arguments , we perform a quantitative modelling of the spectra .",
    "the raman scattering spectra presented in figure  [ fig4 ] can be described by lorentzian functions to extract the energy corresponding to the maximum of scattered light and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the phonon feature .",
    "these results are presented by the black dots in figure  [ fig5 ] ( a - d ) for both polarization configurations .",
    "again , the observed behavior is not a simple series of oscillations ; rather , two series of oscillations can be distinguished .",
    "qualitatively , this is explained by the same arguments as above ( two allowed values of  @xmath8 ) .",
    "the theoretical curves are shown in figure .",
    "[ fig5 ] as solid curves on top of the experimental symbols .",
    "evolution of the maximum of scattered light and of the fwhm of the g band as a function of the magnetic field in the @xmath21 ( a and b ) and in the @xmath22 polarization configurations .",
    "red solid lines are the result of the calculation detailed in the text.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "in contrast to bulk graphite , where due to the translational invariance in the @xmath51  direction , the momentum conservation holds , which implies that only phonons with the wave vector @xmath52 are probed ( assuming the photon momentum to be very small ) , and that the electronic transitions involved are those from states with some @xmath8 into states with @xmath53 , the 4-layer graphene lacks the translational invariance in the @xmath51  direction , which introduces some additional difficulties in the theoretical description of the magneto - phonon resonance , as compared to the bulk graphite .",
    "( i )  there is _ a priori _ no reason to focus on one particular phonon mode . in total , there are eight degenerate optical phonon modes with zero in - plane wave vector ( two for each layer ) .",
    "the circular basis for the in - plane polarizations is still a good one , thus for each circular polarization there are four phonon modes .",
    "we assume that their degeneracy is lifted by the electron - phonon interaction , neglecting the elastic coupling between the layers .",
    "thus , for each of the two circular polarizations , the normal modes should be found as eigenvectors of the electronic polarization operator @xmath54 , which is a @xmath55 matrix .",
    "( ii )  the electronic polarization operator not only has a contribution from the @xmath8-diagonal electronic transitions , but also from transitions between states with different  @xmath8 , since no momentum conservation holds .",
    "this gives not just two series of transitions , but four , corresponding to all possible combinations of @xmath56 .",
    "still , it can be naturally expected ( and is confirmed by the actual calculation ) that the overlap between states with different  @xmath8 is much smaller than that between states with the same  @xmath8 ; this is why two series of oscillations instead of four are seen in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "( iii )  generally speaking , all four phonon modes should contribute to the raman spectrum .",
    "the intensities of the four components are determined by the projections of the corresponding mode eigenvectors on the raman matrix element ( photon - photon - phonon vertex ) , which is also a four - component vector for each given circular polarization configuration . in bulk graphite , due to the momentum conservation",
    ", the raman vertex would be simply proportional to a @xmath57-function @xmath58 , but in the 4-layer sample it has a non - trivial structure .",
    "the electronic band structure of multilayer graphene is modelled similarly to koshino and ando  @xcite .",
    "namely , in the nearest - layer tight - binding approximation , the band structure of any bernal - stacked multi - layer graphene can be deduced from the one of the bulk graphite by selecting specific values of  @xmath8 corresponding to the possible standing waves perpendicular to the basal plane of the multilayer graphene specimen .",
    "the monolayer graphene then corresponds to a single value of @xmath45 , the bilayer to @xmath59 , the trilayer corresponds to two values of @xmath60 , etc . at each value of @xmath8",
    ", the hamiltonian has the form of an effective graphene bilayer : @xmath61,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the distance between the neighboring carbon atoms in the same layer , @xmath65 are the in - plane momenta counted from the corners of the hexagonal first brillouin zone , and @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 are the parameters of the tight - binding slonczewski - weiss - mcclure ( swm ) model  @xcite , whose values we take the same as in ref .  @xcite . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have neglected the @xmath72  term , responsible for the trigonal warping , in order to simplify the diagonalization of the electronic hamiltonian with an external magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath73 terms in the swm model correspond to the second - nearest - layer coupling , and their non zero values modify the electronic wave functions on the layers with respect to the simple recipe of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we consider the wave functions of ref .",
    "@xcite but we still include the @xmath74 and @xmath75 terms in eq .",
    "( [ bilayerham= ] ) , since the experimental transition energies are better reproduced when also considering these terms .",
    "thus , even though eq .",
    "( [ bilayerham= ] ) , strictly speaking , does not correspond to the swm model , we use it as an effective electronic hamiltonian for the 4-layer graphene . given eq .",
    "( [ bilayerham= ] ) , the calculation of the polarization operator is analogous to the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite with summation over @xmath76 instead of integration over  @xmath8 . following points ( i ) and ( ii ) discussed at the beginning of this section",
    ", we also introduce a layer index for the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the solid curves presented in figure .  [ fig5 ] were obtained using the values @xmath77 , @xmath78 for the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling constant and the electronic broadening respectively , but the values @xmath79 , @xmath80 or @xmath81 , @xmath82 differ very little .",
    "( we remind that the main purpose of the present modelling is not to extract precise values of parameters but to demonstrate that the sample is quadri - layer graphene . )    the third difficulty , mentioned at the beginning of this section , can be bypassed since we are interested only in the positions and widths of the raman peaks , determined by the complex eigenvalues of the electronic polarization operator @xmath54 , i.  e. , by the complex roots of the equation @xmath83=0,\\ ] ] and not in their intensities .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the four eigenvalues behave quite differently upon varying the magnetic field .",
    "only one eigenvalue exhibits pronounced magneto - oscillations , while other three remain close to the bare phonon frequency .",
    "this behavior can be understood by noting that near each resonance  @xmath84 , the polarization operator can be approximated as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the frequency and the broadening of the corresponding transition , and @xmath88 is the corresponding matrix element of the electron - phonon coupling ( the indices @xmath89 label the layers where the phonon displacements occur ) .",
    "then , near the resonance , one phonon eigenvector is along @xmath90 , and other three are orthogonal to it , so that they are effectively decoupled from the resonance .",
    "the theoretical curves in figure  [ fig5 ] correspond to the eigenvalue exhibiting the non - trivial oscillating behavior .",
    "nevertheless , the contribution of other modes , not subject to oscillations , can also be distinguished in the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) around the strongest resonance at @xmath91 .",
    "finally , we note that the possibility to avoid the calculation of the raman matrix element in the 4-layer structure is quite fortunate , since its calculation requires a significant effort even in the monolayer graphene  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that magneto - phonon resonance in multi - layer graphene specimens can be used to determine the specific band structure of these systems .",
    "we demonstrate this possibility in this work with a 4-layer graphene flake deposited on sio@xmath2 .",
