    "a rare event is one which occurs with a very small probability .",
    "however , when they do occur they can have a huge effect and so it is often important to estimate the actual probability of their occurrence .",
    "examples where rare events are important are in banking and insurance , in biological systems where important processes such as genetic switching and mutations occur with extremely small rates , and in nucleation processes .",
    "rare events are also of importance in nonequilibrium processes such as charge and heat transport in small devices and transport in biological cells .",
    "the functioning of nano - electronic devices can be affected by rare large - current fluctuations and it is important to know how often they occur .    in this paper",
    "our interest is in predicting probabilities of rare fluctuations in transport processes .",
    "a number of interesting results have been obtained recently on large fluctuations away from typical behavior in nonequilibrium systems .",
    "these include results such as the fluctuation theorems  @xcite and the jarzynski relation @xcite . in the context of transport one",
    "typically considers an observable , say @xmath0 , such as the total number of particles or heat transferred across an object with an applied chemical potential or temperature difference .",
    "this is a stochastic variable and for a given observation time @xmath1 this will have a distribution @xmath2 .",
    "the various general results that have been obtained for @xmath2 give some quantitative measure of the probability of rare fluctuations .",
    "analytic computations of the tails of @xmath2 for any system are usually difficult .",
    "this is also true in experiments or in computer simulations since the generation of rare events requires a large number of trials .    for large @xmath1",
    "the probabilities of large fluctuations show scaling behavior @xmath3 , where the function @xmath4 is known as the large deviation function  @xcite . for a few model systems exact results have been obtained  @xcite for either @xmath4 or its legendre transform @xmath5 , which can be defined in terms of the characteristic function as @xmath6 . recently an algorithm has been proposed @xcite to compute @xmath5 .",
    "however , as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite there may be problems in obtaining the tails of @xmath5 using the algorithm of ref .",
    "the algorithm proposed in this paper is complementary to the one discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the sense that we obtain @xmath2 directly .",
    "our algorithm , based on the idea of importance sampling , computes @xmath2 for any given @xmath1 and accurately reproduces the tails of the distribution .",
    "algorithms based on importance sampling @xcite have earlier been used in the study of equilibrium systems @xcite and in the study of transition rate processes @xcite .",
    "however , we are not aware of any applications to the study of large fluctuations of currents in nonequilibrium systems and this is the main focus of this paper .",
    "here we choose two prototype models of transport , namely , heat conduction across a harmonic chain and particle transport in the symmetric simple exclusion process .",
    "we illustrate the implementation of importance sampling in the computation of large fluctuations of currents in these two nonequilibrium systems .",
    "consider a system with a time evolution described by the stochastic process @xmath7 .",
    "for simplicity we assume for now that @xmath7 is an integer - valued variable and time is discrete .",
    "let us denote a particular path in configuration space over a time period @xmath1 by the vector @xmath8 and let @xmath0 be an observable which is a function of the path @xmath9",
    ". we will be interested in finding the probability distribution @xmath2 of @xmath0 and especially in computing the probability of large deviations about the mean value @xmath10 . as a simple illustrative example consider the tossing of a fair coin .",
    "for @xmath11 tosses we have a discrete stochastic process described by the time series @xmath12 where @xmath13 if the outcome in the @xmath14th trial is heads and @xmath15 otherwise .",
    "suppose we want to find the probability of generating @xmath0 heads ( thus @xmath16 ) .",
    "an example of a rare event is , for example , the event @xmath17 .",
    "the probability of this is @xmath18 and if we were to simulate the coin toss experiment we would need more than @xmath19 repeats of the experiment to realize this event with sufficient frequency to calculate the probability reliably . for large @xmath20 this is clearly very difficult .",
    "the importance sampling algorithm is useful in such situations .",
    "the basic idea is to increase the occurrence of the rare events by introducing a bias in the dynamics .",
    "the rare events are produced with a new probability corresponding to the bias .",
    "however , by keeping track of the relative weights of trajectories of the unbiased and biased processes it is possible to recover the required probability corresponding to the required unbiased process .",
    "we now describe the algorithm in the context of evaluating @xmath2 for the stochastic process @xmath9 .",
    "we denote the probability of a particular trajectory by @xmath21 . by definition : @xmath22 for the same system let us consider a biased dynamics for which the probability of the same path @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 .",
    "then we have : @xmath25 thus in terms of the biased dynamics , @xmath2 is the average @xmath26 and in a simulation we estimate this by performing averages over @xmath27 realizations to obtain : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the path for the @xmath30th realization .",
    "for @xmath31 we obtain @xmath32 which is the required probability .",
    "note that the weight factor @xmath33 is a function of the path . in a simulation",
    "we know the details of the microscopic dynamics for both the biased and unbiased processes .",
    "thus we can evaluate @xmath33 for every path @xmath23 generated by the biased dynamics .",
    "a necessary requirement of the biased dynamics is that the distribution of @xmath0 that it produces [ i.e. , @xmath34 should be peaked around the desired values of @xmath0 for which we want an accurate measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "as we will see the required dynamics can often be guessed from physical considerations .",
    "we first explain the algorithm for the coin tossing experiment . in this case",
    "we consider a biased dynamics where the probability of heads is @xmath35 and that of tails is @xmath36 . if we take @xmath37 then the event @xmath17 , which was earlier rare , is now generated with increased frequency and we can use eq .",
    "( [ pest ] ) to estimate the required probability @xmath38 . for any path consisting of @xmath0 heads the weight factor",
    "is simply given by @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "choosing @xmath40 it is easy to see that for @xmath41 we can get the required probability @xmath38 with more than @xmath42 accuracy using only @xmath43 realizations as opposed to at least @xmath44 required by the unbiased dynamics .",
    "note that for this example @xmath33 has the same value for all paths with the same @xmath0 .",
    "in general of course @xmath33 depends on the details of the path , _ e.g. _ for a random walk with a waiting probability .",
    "we will now illustrate the algorithm with non - trivial examples of computing large deviations in two well known models in nonequilibrium physics .",
    "these are the ( i ) symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) with open boundaries and ( ii ) heat conduction across a harmonic system connected to langevin reservoirs .",
    "this is a well studied example of an interacting stochastic system consisting of particles diffusing on a lattice with the constraint that each site can have at most one particle .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to one - dimension and study the case of an open system where a linear chain with @xmath45 sites is connected to particle reservoirs at the two ends .",
    "the dynamics can be specified by the following rules : ( a ) a particle at any site @xmath46 can jump to a neighboring empty site with unit rate ; ( b ) at @xmath47 a particle can enter the system with rate @xmath48 ( if it is empty ) and leave with rate @xmath49 . at site",
    "@xmath20 a particle can leave or enter the system with rates @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the biased dynamics can be realized in various ways , for example , by introducing asymmetry in the bulk hopping rates or by changing the boundary hopping rates .    for ssep ,",
    "the configuration of the system at any time is specified by the set @xmath52 where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) gives the occupancy of the @xmath56th site .",
    "the dynamical rules specify the matrix element @xmath57 giving the transition rate from configuration @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "we write @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 correspond to transitions whereby a particle enters the system from the left bath or leaves the system into the left bath , respectively , while @xmath63 corresponds to all other transitions . at long times",
    "the system will reach a steady state with particles flowing across the system and we are here interested in the current fluctuations in the wire .",
    "specifically , let @xmath0 be the net particle transfer from the left reservoir into the system during a time interval @xmath1 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath1 we want to obtain the distribution @xmath2 of @xmath0 , in the steady state of the system .",
    "it is useful to define the joint probability distribution function @xmath64 for @xmath0 number of particles transported and for the system to be in state @xmath65 , given that at @xmath66 the system is in the steady state .",
    "clearly @xmath67 .",
    "we also define the characteristic functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is then easy to obtain the following master equation @xcite : @xmath70\\,\\tilde{r}(z,\\mathcal{c'},\\tau).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the general solution of this equation for arbitrary @xmath45 is difficult but for @xmath71 an explicit solution can be obtained for @xmath72 and @xmath73 . we will here first discuss a special case @xmath74 for which @xmath73 can be inverted explicitly .",
    "the choice of steady state initial conditions gives the solution : @xmath75 $ ] . in fig .",
    "( [ fig-1-part ] ) we plot the exact distribution along with a direct simulation of the above process with averaging over @xmath76 realizations . as we can see",
    "the direct simulation is accurate only for events with probabilities of @xmath77 .",
    "now we illustrate our algorithm using a biased dynamics .",
    "we consider biasing obtained by changing the boundary transition rates .",
    "we denote the rates of the biased dynamics by @xmath78 and these are chosen such that @xmath79 has a peak in the required region . in our simulation",
    "we consider a discrete - time implementation of ssep .",
    "for every realization of the process over a time @xmath1 ( after throwing away transients ) the weight factor @xmath33 is dynamically evaluated .",
    "for instance , every time a particle hops into the system from the left reservoir , @xmath33 is incremented by @xmath80 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig-1-part ] ) we see the result of using our algorithm with two different biases .",
    "using the same number of realizations we are now able to find probabilities up to @xmath81 and the comparison with the exact result is excellent .     for @xmath82 for the one - site ssep model with @xmath83 .",
    "mc refers to direct monte carlo simulations . left",
    "bias corresponds to @xmath84 and right bias to @xmath85.,width=312 ]     for @xmath82 for the three - site ssep model with @xmath86 .",
    "mc refers to direct monte carlo simulations . for left ( right ) bias simulations , the particles in bulk hop to the left ( right ) with rate @xmath87 and to the right ( left ) with unit rate",
    "the boundary rates are kept unchanged.,width=312 ]    we next study the case with @xmath88 with rates chosen such that the system reaches a nonequilibrium steady state with @xmath89 . finding @xmath90 analytically involves diagonalizing an @xmath91 matrix .",
    "we do this numerically and after an inverse laplace transform find @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig-3-part ] ) we show the numerical and direct simulation results for this case and also the results obtained using the biased dynamics ; in this case we consider a biased dynamics with asymmetric bulk hopping rates .",
    "again we find that the biasing algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of finding probabilities of rare events using the same number of realizations ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "for @xmath93 for heat conduction across a single free particle with @xmath94 .",
    "the parameters have been chosen to correspond to a region in parameter space where the fluctuation theorem is not satisfied @xcite .",
    "mc refers to direct monte carlo simulations .",
    "the left bias corresponds to @xmath95.,width=312 ]    next we consider the problem of heat conduction across a system connected to heat reservoirs modeled by langevin white - noise reservoirs . here",
    "we are interested in the distribution of the net heat transfer @xmath0 from the left bath into the system over time @xmath1 .",
    "first let us consider the simple example of a single brownian particle connected to two baths at temperatures @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this model was studied recently by visco  @xcite who obtained an exact expression for the characteristic function of @xmath0 .",
    "the equation of motion for the system is given by : @xmath98 where @xmath99 are gaussian delta - correlated noises with zero mean and unit variance , thus @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the heat flow from the left bath into the system in time @xmath1 is given by @xmath102 .",
    "for the single brownian particle in this problem it is sufficient to specify the state by the velocity @xmath103 alone .",
    "if we choose @xmath104 then @xmath2 will have a peak at @xmath105 .",
    "it is clear that to use the biasing algorithm to compute probabilities of rare events with @xmath106 we can choose a biased dynamics with temperatures of left and right reservoirs taken to be @xmath107 and @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "the calculation of the weight factor @xmath33 is somewhat tricky since computing @xmath110 $ ] from @xmath111 $ ] is non - trivial .",
    "also one can not eliminate @xmath112 to express @xmath0 as a functional of only the path @xmath113 . to get around this problem",
    "we note the following mapping of the single - particle system to the over - damped dynamics of two coupled oscillators @xcite given by the equations of motion : @xmath114 .",
    "the variable @xmath115 satisfies the same equation as @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ visco1 ] ) .",
    "thus with the same definition for @xmath0 as given earlier we can use the above equations for @xmath116 and @xmath117 to find @xmath2 . in this case",
    "we do not have the problem as earlier and both @xmath0 and @xmath33 can be readily expressed in terms of @xmath118 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath119 the parameters of the biased system .",
    "also let @xmath120 be the noise realizations in the biased process that result in the same path @xmath118 as produced by @xmath99 for the original process .",
    "choosing @xmath121 for @xmath122 it can be shown that : @xmath123 .",

    "( [ fig - visco ] ) we show results for @xmath2 obtained both directly and using the biased dynamics .",
    "again we see that for the same number of realizations ( @xmath126 ) one can obtain probabilities about @xmath127 times smaller than using direct simulations .",
    "the comparison with the numerical results obtained from the exact expression for @xmath128 @xcite also shows the accuracy of the algorithm .     for @xmath129 for heat conduction across two particles connected by a harmonic spring with unit spring constant and @xmath130 .",
