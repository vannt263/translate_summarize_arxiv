    "<S> this paper generalizes two previously known techniques for generating minimally coupled einstein - scalar field solutions in 4 dimensions ; the buchdahl and fonarev transformations . </S>",
    "<S> two generalizations are made : i ) the transformation is generalized to arbitrary dimension , and ii ) the new transformation allows vacuum solutions with non - zero cosmological constant as seed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by applying this solution generation technique , minimally coupled einstein - scalar field solutions can be generated from vacuum solutions with arbitrary cosmological constant in arbitrary dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the only requirement to a seed solution is that it posesses a hypersurface - orthogonal  killing vector field .  </S>",
    "<S> the generalization that allows us to use seed solutions with arbitrary cosmological constant uncovers a new class of einstein - scalar field solutions that has previously not been studied . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the new solution transformation to the @xmath0 vacuum solution . transforming the resulting einstein - scalar field solution to the conformal frame , a two - parameter family of spatially finite , expanding and accelerating cosmological solutions </S>",
    "<S> are found that are conformally isometric to the einstein static universe @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we study null geodesics and find that for any observer , the solution has a cosmological horizon at an angular distance of @xmath2 away from the observer . </S>",
    "<S> a subset of these solutions are studied in particular : a solution of this kind has an initial point singularity that vanishes at early times as well as another point singularity that emerges at late times . </S>",
    "<S> the solution is non - singular in between those events . </S>",
    "<S> the late time singularity is hidden behind an event horizon , and these solutions can therefore be naturally interpreted as expanding cosmologies in which a scalar black hole is formed at late times . </S>",
    "<S> the energy density is positive definite only in parts of the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> the conformally coupled scalar field satisfies the weak energy condition as long as the energy density is positive , while the strong energy condition is generally violated .    </S>",
