    ", these non - perturbative parton densities can be probed universally in a multitude of inelastic scattering processes , for which it is possible to separate ( `` factorize '' ) the long - distance physics relating to nucleon structure from a partonic short - distance scattering that is amenable to qcd perturbation theory . combined experimental and theoretical efforts",
    "have led to an improved understanding of the spin structure of longitudinally polarized nucleons , @xmath4 , in the past years .",
    "in contrast , the `` transversity '' distributions @xmath5 , first introduced in @xcite , remain the quantities about which we have the least knowledge .",
    "current and future experiments are designed to further unravel the spin structure of both longitudinally and transversely polarized nucleons .",
    "information will soon be gathered for the first time from polarized proton - proton collisions at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "collisions of transversely polarized protons will be studied , and the potential of rhic in accessing transversity @xmath5 in transverse double - spin asymmetries @xmath6 was recently examined in @xcite for high transverse momentum @xmath0 prompt photon and jet production .",
    "several other studies of @xmath6 for these reactions have been presented in the past @xcite , as well as for the drell - yan process @xcite . with the exception of the latter reaction @xcite ,",
    "all of these calculations were performed at the lowest order ( lo ) approximation only . as is well known ,",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections are generally indispensable in order to arrive at a firmer theoretical prediction for hadronic cross sections and spin asymmetries . only with their knowledge",
    "can one reliably confront theory with experimental data and achieve the goal of extracting information on the partonic spin structure of nucleons .    in this paper",
    "we extend the results of @xcite for isolated high-@xmath0 prompt photon production , @xmath7 , to the nlo of qcd . apart from the motivation given above ,",
    "also interesting new technical questions arise beyond the nlo in case of transverse polarization . unlike for longitudinally polarized cross sections where",
    "the spin vectors are aligned with momentum , transverse spin vectors specify extra spacial directions , giving rise to non - trivial dependence of the cross section on the azimuthal angle of the observed photon . as is well - known @xcite , for @xmath6 this dependence is always of the form @xmath1 , if the @xmath8 axis is defined by the direction of the initial protons in their center - of - mass system ( c.m.s . ) , and the spin vectors are taken to point in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "integration over the photon s azimuthal angle is therefore not appropriate . on the other hand , standard techniques developed in the literature for performing nlo phase - space integrations usually rely on the choice of particular reference frames that are related in complicated ways to the one just specified",
    "this makes it difficult to fix @xmath10 in the higher order phase space integration .",
    "the problem actually becomes more severe if dimensional regularization techniques are used for dealing with the collinear and infrared singularities , as is customary .",
    "even for the kinematically rather simple drell - yan process the nlo calculation for the cross section with transverse polarization is quite more complicated as for the unpolarized or longitudinally polarized cases @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will present a new general technique which facilitates nlo calculations with transverse polarization by conveniently projecting on the azimuthal dependence of the matrix elements in a covariant way .",
    "this method then allows us to carry out phase space integrals with standard tools known from unpolarized calculations .    after presenting our technique and verifying that it recovers the known result for the transversely polarized nlo drell - yan cross section",
    ", we apply it to high-@xmath0 prompt photon production .",
    "we also present some first numerical calculations of the cross sections and the transverse spin asymmetry for this process at nlo . here",
    "we of course have to rely on some model for the transversity densities , for which we make use of the soffer inequality @xcite . as in experiment",
    ", we impose an isolation cut on the photon . we find a moderate size of the nlo corrections and the expected reduced scale dependence of the cross section at nlo .",
    "the transversity density @xmath11 is defined @xcite as the difference of probabilities for finding a parton of flavor @xmath3 at scale @xmath12 and light - cone momentum fraction @xmath13 with its spin aligned ( @xmath14 ) or anti - aligned ( @xmath15 ) to that of the transversely polarized nucleon : @xmath16 ( an arrow always denotes transverse polarization in the following ) .",
    "the unpolarized densities are recovered by taking the sum in eq .",

    "when the transverse polarization is described as a superposition of helicity eigenstates , @xmath5 reveals its helicity - flip , chirally odd , nature @xcite . as a result",

    "an estimate of such effects could follow the lines in @xcite . ] .",
    "the property of helicity conservation in qcd hard scattering processes implies that there have to be two soft hadronic pieces in the process that each flip chirality , in order to give sensitivity to transversity .",

    "we recall from the previous section that we have performed an analytical integration over the full phase space of the unobserved particles in the final - state .",
    "this seems at first sight to preclude the implementation of an isolation cut `` afterwards '' .",

    "the lower part of the figure displays the so called `` @xmath152-factor '' @xmath153 one can see that nlo corrections are somewhat smaller for @xmath154 and increase with @xmath0 . as we have mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "one reason why it is generally important to know nlo corrections is that they should considerably reduce the dependence of the cross sections on the unphysical factorization and renormalization scales . in this sense ,",
    "the @xmath152-factor has actually limited significance since it is likely to be rather scale dependent through the presence of the lo cross section in its denominator .",
    "the improvement in scale dependence when going from lo to nlo is , therefore , a better measure of the impact of the nlo corrections .",
    "the shaded bands in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] indicate the uncertainties from varying the scales in the range @xmath155 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are always for the choice where all scales are set to @xmath0 , and so is the @xmath152 factor underneath .",
    "one can see that the scale dependence indeed becomes much weaker at nlo .",
    "figure  [ fig : att ] shows the spin asymmetry @xmath156 which is perhaps the main quantity of interest here , calculated at lo ( dashed lines ) and nlo ( solid lines ) .",
    "we have again chosen all scales to be @xmath0 .",
    "due to a larger @xmath152 factor for the unpolarized cross section , the asymmetry is smaller at nlo than at lo .",
    "we also display in fig .",
    "[ fig : att ] the statistical errors expected in experiment",
    ". they may be estimated by the formula @xcite @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the transverse polarization of each beam , @xmath159 the integrated luminosity of the collisions , and @xmath160 the unpolarized cross section integrated over the @xmath0-bin for which the error is to be determined .",

    "we have presented in this paper the complete nlo qcd corrections for the partonic hard - scattering cross sections relevant for the spin asymmetry @xmath2 for high-@xmath0 prompt photon production in transversely polarized proton - proton collisions .",
    "this asymmetry could be a tool to determine the transversity content of the nucleon at rhic .",
    "our calculation is based on a largely analytical evaluation of the nlo partonic cross sections .",
    "we have presented a simple technique for treating , in an nlo calculation , the azimuthal - angle dependence introduced by the transverse spin vectors .",
    "we will apply this technique to other @xmath6 in the future , such as for inclusive pion and jet production @xcite .",
    "we found that at rhic energies the nlo corrections to the polarized cross section are somewhat smaller than those in the unpolarized case .",
