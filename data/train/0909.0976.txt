    "cold atoms constitute a promising route to simulate _ model _ hamiltonians of strongly correlated many - body physics with accurate control of system parameters@xcite . after major experimental breakthroughs with ultracold bosonic atoms like the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of alkali gases @xcite or the observation of the superfluid - mott insulator transition in a bosonic hubbard model @xcite ,",
    "the field of ultracold atoms is currently addressing problems of strongly correlated fermionic systems@xcite .",
    "arguably the most prominent goal is the understanding of the phase - diagram of the fermionic hubbard model , which is believed to be of major importance for high - temperature superconductivity @xcite . a two - component fermi - gas in an optical lattice",
    "is well - described by the single - band hubbard model , whenever the energy gap to higher bands is much larger than onsite interaction , temperature , and chemical potential@xcite .",
    "only recently the fermionic mott transition has been realized experimentally@xcite .",
    "the major challenge for studying magnetism of the fermionic hubbard model is to reach temperatures below the nel temperature@xcite .",
    "in addition to the preparation of the antiferromagnetic state , characterization tools have to be developed to allow a clear identification of the magnetic structure .",
    "possible experimental techniques include bragg spectroscopy@xcite , local measurements of the magnetization@xcite , noise correlations@xcite , or the recently realized quantum gas microscope@xcite .",
    "the experimental control of spin imbalance in fermi gases offered a unique way to study pairing phenomena beyond the standard bcs picture for attractive interactions@xcite .",
    "motivated by these results , we address in this work the effect of spin imbalance on the repulsive fermionic hubbard model@xcite .",
    "while we study strong optical lattices , where a single - band hubbard model is realized , the magnetic structure of weak to intermediate lattice strength including multiple bands has also been discussed@xcite .",
    "we find rich physics arising from the interplay between antiferromagnetic and stoner ferromagnetic instabilities and spin imbalance .",
    "the magnetic order of the two - dimensional repulsive hubbard model has been extensively studied in the past , see e.g. ref .. cold atoms in optical lattices differ in several ways from typical condensed matter systems .",
    "first , there is a superposed external confinement potential , which divides the system in an incompressible mott state in the center of the trap and a compressible region at the edge .",
    "second , the total spin is conserved , which means that we need to minimize the energy of the system given a global magnetization rather than a finite zeeman field . one interesting problem concerns the spatial distribution of the imbalance between mott plateau and edge , and it turns out that the solution strongly depends on the interaction strength .",
    "the constraint of spin conservation affects the ferromagnetic instability at the edge by enforcing nontrivial spin textures@xcite which also affects the neel order in the mott plateau in the center , as we will discuss in section  [ topology ] .    in this work we study the repulsive fermionic hubbard model including a parabolic confinement potential . in the first part of this work we perform unrestricted hartree - fock calculations for the 2d case .",
    "relevant physics for this system can be identified based on the mean - field phase diagram for the repulsive 2d homogeneous hubbard model@xcite .",
    "up to a critical interaction strength @xmath0 it predicts antiferromagnetic order close to half -filling and paramagnetic order elsewhere . in the spirit of a local density approximation",
    "one might then expect that cold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice have antiferromagnetic correlations in spatial regions with one atom per site and are paramagnetic elsewhere . in order to account for a finite imbalance",
    ", the system has to change its magnetic structure . using an unrestricted hartree - fock approach for the 2d system",
    "we find a canted antiferromagnet in the mott plateau in the trap center and a partially polarized edge .",
    "we note that canted antiferromagnetic order close to half - filling has been reported previously in ref .  .",
    "with spin polarization along the @xmath2-direction , the canted antiferromagnet accommodates the imbalance forming a constant @xmath2-component of the local magnetization , and simultaneously it benefits from the superexchange interaction by building up an alternating magnetic order perpendicular to the @xmath2-direction .",
    "fixing the global imbalance and increasing the interaction strength results in more imbalance flowing to the edge .    above a critical interaction strength @xmath0",
    "the unrestricted hartree - fock calculation predicts that the system turns ferromagnetic at the edge of the trap , in agreement with the ferromagnetic stoner instability of a homogeneous system away from half - filling .",
    "furthermore , the orientation of the antiferromagnetic order in the mott plateau is perpendicular to the direction of the ferromagnet in the edge .",
    "spin conservation has again a strong impact on the magnetic structure of the system , since a uniformly polarized ferromagnetic edge together with an antiferromagnetic mott plateau are generally not allowed .",
    "we will discuss spin textures in 2d and 3d lattices for @xmath3 , which fulfill spin conservation and which show the two prominent features predicted by the mean - field calculation , namely a ) magnetic instabilities towards ferromagnetism in the compressible edge and antiferromagnetism in the mott plateau and b ) at the interface between mott plateau and compressible edge , the orientation of the antiferromagnet and the ferromagnet are perpendicular to each other .",
    "we are aware that the chosen mean - field approach generally overestimates symmetry breaking and therefore the critical on - site interaction strength , @xmath0 , corresponding to the appearance of an intrinsic ferromagnetic edge , will presumably be higher than the one predicted here .",
    "however , intrinsic ferromagnetism away from half - filling is expected for sufficiently large interaction strength@xcite and in fact experimental indications for itinerant ferromagnetism in a fermi gas of ultracold atoms have been reported recently in ref .. given the tunability of the ratio between onsite interaction and nearest neighbor hopping , @xmath4 , the interaction strength required for the presented phase separation should be accessible in experiment ( @xmath5 have been reported in ref . ) .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ] we summarize our findings and comment on the experimental significance of our results .",
    "we consider the fermionic single band hubbard model on a 2d and 3d cubic lattice with an external parabolic confining potential . the hamiltonian is @xmath6 where @xmath7 labels the two fermionic components , which are the eigenstates of the @xmath2-component of a spin algebra .",

    "the associated energy scale is the confinement strength at the edge of the atom cloud with one atom per site , denoted by @xmath18 . in 2d @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the particle number .",
    "we now apply a hartree - fock mean - field decoupling in the spin and the density channel .",
    "since the trap breaks translational invariance , the mean - field parameters will be site - dependent . allowing for arbitrary spin and density at each site we obtain the following mean - field hamiltonian@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the spin operator at site @xmath10 ( @xmath23 is the vector of pauli matrices ) and @xmath24 is the local magnetization .",
    "magnetization and density are determined self - consistently for fixed total particle number @xmath20 . in the following we assume zero temperature .",
    "the energy of the self - consistent solution is given by the sum over the lowest @xmath20 single - particle energies of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : mf2 ] ) plus the constant energy @xmath25 .",
    "an important subclass of self - consistent solutions are the ones with collinear magnetization where @xmath26 on all sites . in particular , the generic phases of the homogeneous hubbard model@xcite have a collinear magnetization ; either ferromagnetic @xmath27 , antiferromagnetic @xmath28 , or paramagnetic @xmath29 .",
    "however , we will show that generally the combination of trapping potential and imbalance will lead to a non - collinear magnetization profile .",
    "we are interested in the ground state for a given imbalance , characterized by the polarization @xmath30 , which is an experimentally controllable parameter@xcite .",
    "the imbalance is conserved , since the two components correspond to different internal states of the atoms ( typically different hyperfine states ) and transitions between these states are energetically forbidden unless they are driven by additional lasers .",
    "the single particle eigenstates of the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "the parabolic confinement will decrease the density away from the trap center . in a local density approximation",
    ", a cross section through the trap corresponds to a cut through the @xmath33 phase diagram at constant interaction @xmath13 .",
    "polarization can most easily be accommodated by ferromagnetism , but also antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic regions can account for finite imbalance . as discussed in the introduction , in a canted antiferromaget a spatially constant component aligned with the field is added to the alternating component perpendicular to the imbalance .",
    "the paramagnetic region can be partially polarized in the spirit of pauli paramagnetism , where the polarization is proportional to the applied field . in the following",
    "we show that canted antiferromagnetic order is realized at half - filling , and we study how the imbalance is distributed between mott plateau and edge as a function of interaction and imbalance .",

    "then the ferromagnetic order at the edge points in the @xmath2-direction and the antiferromagnet in the mott plateau is canted as shown in the lower panel of fig  [ fig : imbal ] .",
    "we now increase the number of particles so that the center of the trap is more than half - filled . in agreement with the symmetry of the homogeneous hubbard model around half - filling , we find that the edge between the mott plateau and double occupied sites shows similar features as the outer edge discussed above .",

    "the hartree - fock calculation predicts that above a critical interaction strength @xmath0 the edge of the atom cloud turns ferromagnetic , even in absence of any imbalance or fictitious magnetic field . in the previous section we defined a critical polarization , @xmath64 , corresponding to a fully polarized ferromagnetic edge along the @xmath2-direction and an antiferromagnetic mott plateau . in this section",

    "the remaining two energy terms describe the interface between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order at the edge of the mott plateau and the energy of the spin structure in the mott plateau .",

    "we minimize the interface term by choosing the orientation of the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic order to be perpendicular to each other at the interface between mott plateau and compressible edge . in the following we discuss solutions , where the mott plateau has no net imbalance .",
    "in fact , in the limit of large interactions @xmath76 , the superexchange @xmath70 vanishes , so that one could allow for a strong polarization of the edge , by polarizing the mott plateau in the opposite way .",

    ", the antiferromagnet in the mott plateau will have an in - plane magnetization forming a vortex and a @xmath2-component .",
    "the lowest energy corresponds to the maximally allowed @xmath2-component of the antiferromagnetic order parameter thus minimizing the in - plane vortex .",
    "we now give quantitative arguments for the physics described above based on a comparison of the energies of a ferromagnetic edge with different topologies ; either a vortex , a domain wall , or a skyrmion as depicted in figs  [ fig : topology2da ] and  [ fig : topology2 ] .",
    "first we discuss the balanced system . for the vortex",
    "the direction of magnetization is independent of radius but it rotates by @xmath90 on each circumference .",
    "a particular realization of a vortex is @xmath91 .",
    "however , for the balanced system there is global rotation invariance and the plane of the vortex is arbitrary . using eq .",
    ", the energy cost of a vortex is given by @xmath92 . even in the absence of a mott - plateau",
    ", the lattice spacing , @xmath93 , gives a natural cutoff for the core energy leading to @xmath94 .",
    "a vortex naturally fulfills the requirement of vanishing global magnetization in all three spatial directions .",
    "another possibility is the formation of a domain wall . in the inner ring @xmath95",
    "there is a uniform polarization ( e.g. @xmath96 ) and within a finite region , @xmath89 , the sign of the magnetization is inverted , e.g. @xmath97 . in the outer ring , @xmath98 , the magnetization points in opposite direction , e.g. @xmath99 .",
    "while the inner and outer rings have a perfect uniform ferromagnetic order , the domain wall is energetically costly due to the suppression of the amplitude of the order parameter .",
    "the energy cost is given by @xmath100 , with @xmath101 denoting the coherence length . @xmath102 and @xmath103 are not independent of each other but related by the condition of vanishing global magnetization . in absence of any mott - plateau , @xmath104 , the smallest allowed value is @xmath105 which increases with @xmath72 . neglecting the term containing the coherence length",
    "we therefore obtain a lower bound for the energy of the domain wall : @xmath106 .    finally , we estimate the energy of a skyrmion . the magnetization is uniform ( e.g. @xmath96 ) in the inner ring , @xmath95 , and",
    "then it rotates by an angle @xmath107 around a local axis in a ring of width @xmath103 , @xmath89 , e.g. @xmath108 . for @xmath109 ,",
    "the magnetization in the outer ring is inverted , while for other angles it has a vortex structure , e.g. @xmath110 .",
    "the skyrmion interpolates between the inner and outer rings by tilting the order parameter , keeping the amplitude of the magnetization fixed in constrast to the domain wall where the amplitude is suppressed . in the region , @xmath89 , the magnetization of the skyrmion changes in the radial direction and along the circumference .",
    "the radial dependence of the magnetization gives rise to an energy contribution given by @xmath111 .",
    "again the variables @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath16 are not independent of each other but related by the condition of vanishing global magnetization . by minimizing this energy only , and neglecting the energy cost of the change of magnetization along the circumference",
    ", we get a lower bound for the skyrmion energy : @xmath112 .    according to these estimates",
    "the lower bound of the energy for the domain wall is larger than the total energy of the vortex for @xmath113 , and the lower bound for the skyrmion is larger than the vortex energy for @xmath114 .",
    "in fact , the real minima for both skyrmion and domain wall will be larger .",
    "since the radius of the whole atomic cloud is about 50 lattice sites@xcite , our conservative estimate shows that the vortex should be favored for practically any size of the mott - plateau .",
    "we note that for the results shown in the main part of this paper @xmath115 . for the balanced system",
    "there is global rotation invariance and the plane of the vortex structure is arbitrary .",
    "however , in presence of a finite imbalance the energetically preferred magnetization will be a vortex in the @xmath77-plane with a uniform ferromagnetic @xmath2-component .",
    "assuming that the directions of the ferromagnetic edge and the antiferromagnet in the mott - plateau are perpendicular , we expect the direction of antiferromagnet to have a large @xmath2-component .      minimizing the free energy in eq .",
    ", one finds that the preferred structure of the ferromagnetic edge in a balanced 3d system is a hedgehog@xcite .",
    "we now explain why we expect the antiferromagnetic order in the center to have a planar vortex structure for @xmath3 and @xmath61 .",
    "first , at the edge of the mott plateau , the preferred direction of the antiferromagnetic order is perpendicular to the orientation of the ferromagnet order in the edge . a violation of this requirement will cost an energy that scales with the area of the interface @xmath84 . in order to fulfill the boundary condition at the edge of the mott plateau , the antiferromagnetic order in the trap center can neither have perfect nel order nor a hedgehog configuration , since the latter needs to be oriented in the radial direction .",
    "one possibility is to build up the 3d magnetization from the preferred 2d solution for each plane @xmath2 , which is given by @xmath116^{1/2 } \\vec{e}_z\\right\\}$ ] , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are cylindrical unit vectors .",
    "however , this solution is not realized in 3d , since the change in the @xmath2-component of the magnetization between different planes costs a large energy that scales with the volume of the mott plateau @xmath119 .",
    "in fact , the preferred magnetic orders in the mott plateau are either planar vortex structures like @xmath120 or 3d solutions like @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are spherical unit vectors .",
    "for the balanced system these solutions have the same energy given by @xmath121 .",
    "however , imbalance will deform the hedgehog at the edge of the trap leading to a net @xmath2-component .",
    "such a deformation increases the energy of these solutions except for a vortex in @xmath79plane .",
    "therefore we expect the magnetization profile in 3d for @xmath3 and small imbalance to be given by a ( slightly deformed ) hedgehog ferromagnet at the edge of the trap and an antiferromagnetic order with a vortex structure in the @xmath79plane in the center of the trap .",
    "in contrast with the 2d case , where we expect a strong @xmath2-component in the antiferromagnetic order for @xmath3 and @xmath61 , we expect a vanishing @xmath2-component of the antiferromagnetic order in the mott plateau in 3d .",
    "in section  [ topology ] we propose spin structures for @xmath3 and @xmath61 that minimize the total energy while fulfilling the spin conservation  .",
    "the constraints   prohibits the formation of a uniform ferromagnet at the edge of the trap if simultaneously the mott plateau has an antiferromagnetic structure with zero net imbalance .",
    "however , since the constraints   apply to the whole system , one could imagine a system consisting of a fully polarized ferromagnetic edge and a mott plateau strongly polarized in the opposite direction , such that the global imbalance is small or even zero .",
    "we now justify why such solutions are energetically more costly than the ones proposed in section  [ topology ] .",
    "we therefore discuss the magnetic structure of a balanced fermi gas in a 3d trap .",
    "the system can be divided into a mott plateau for radius @xmath122 and an edge for radius @xmath123 . in section  [ topology ]",
    "we claimed that the ferromagnetic structure at the edge forms a hedgehog . applying the ginzburg - landau type free energy in eq .  , the energy of a hedgehog can be estimated .",
    "we strongly simplify our calculation by assuming a constant density at the edge.@xcite the magnetitude @xmath68 of the ferromagnetic magnetization is therefore constant along with the stiffness , @xmath67 , in eq .. we now estimate the energy of the ferromagnetic hedgehog as @xmath124 . the stiffness of a homogeneous fermi gas is given by @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the fermi wavevector , @xmath127 the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath128 the mass of the fermions , and @xmath129 is the density ( see e.g. ref .  ) . for sufficiently small densities",
    "the mass of a particle hopping between nearest neighbors in a 3d cubic lattice is given by @xmath130 , where @xmath16 is the lattice constant and @xmath14 the hopping matrix element between nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the stiffness on a 3d cubic lattice is therefore given by @xmath131 and the energy of the balanced hedgehog becomes @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the number of atoms at the edge of the trap .",
    "this energy could be gained by uniformly polarizing the edge . however , due to the conservation of the total imbalance the mott plateau would then also be polarized by @xmath134 , where @xmath135 denotes the number of atoms in the mott plateau . the corresponding cost in energy",
    "can be estimated as @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the number of nearest neighbors in the mott plateau and @xmath138 is the superexchange .",
    "the energy cost of polarizing the mott plateau is smaller than the energy gain of forming a uniform ferromagnetic edge if @xmath139 .",
    "this is not satisfied for realistic particle numbers @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "we thus conclude that in 3d for @xmath142 and @xmath61 the mott plateau is not significantly polarized .",
    "the magnetic structures that minimize the total energy and fulfill eq .",
    "are therefore the ones presented in section  [ topology ] .",
    "we expect similar arguments to hold in 2d .",
