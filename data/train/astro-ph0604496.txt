    "it has been long known ( persic , salucci & stel 1996 , pss hereafter ) that the shape of rotation curves of spirals is rigidly determined by a single global parameter , e.g. , luminosity or the number of baryons in a galaxy .",
    "this feature was stressed in pss by an empirical construction of a universal rotation curve ( urc ) which describes quite well the rotation velocity at any radius and for any galaxy as a function of , say , the galaxy luminosity only .",
    "it follows that the distribution of the dark matter ( dm ) in galaxies carries a universal character as well , and is a function of the luminous mass .",
    "note that the standard cold dm ( cdm ) models fail to explain this strong dark - to - luminous matter coupling , by an obvious reason : in any model where dm is built from hypothetical non - baryonic particles ( e.g. , cdm , worm dm , or self- interacting dm ) the number of the dm particles in the halo of a galaxy is , essentially , a free parameter and relating it to the number of baryons in the galaxy requires some very strong nonlinearity .",
    "moreover , it is well established that the dm density in galaxies shows an inner core , i.e. a central constant density region ( e.g. , see gentile et al . , 2004 and references therein ; weldrake , de blok & walter 2003 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ; for spirals and gerhard et al . , 2001",
    "; borriello , salucci & danese 2003 for ellipticals ) , which is in a clear conflict with the predictions of @xmath2 cdm models yielding nfw - type profiles with a cusp ( e.g. @xmath3 ) in the central region of a galaxy ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) .",
    "the strong coupling between dm halos and baryons ( see also donato , gentile & salucci 2004 ) definitely requires some new physics .",
    "the coupling can be described by a rigid relation between the sources of dark , @xmath4 , and visible , @xmath5 , matter , the so - called bias relation ( kirillov 2006 ) . in the linear case",
    "the most general form of the bias relation is @xmath6 the homogeneity assumption @xmath7 allows one to fix empirically the bias operator @xmath8 . indeed , in this case the fourier transform of the bias relation ( [ br1 ] ) gives @xmath9 where we added a dependence on time to account for the cosmic evolution .",
    "the empirical bias function @xmath10 @xmath11 , in virtue merely of its definition , will perfectly describe dm effects at very large scales ( i.e. in the region of linear perturbations ) .",
    "the present universe is not quite homogeneous though , e.g. it is not uniform at galaxy scales",
    ". still we would expect relation ( [ br2 ] ) to hold in the geometrical optics limit ( i.e. for rather short wavelengths as compared to the hubble scale , or to a cluster scale when a single galaxy is considered )",
    ". parameters of the bias function may then vary for different spatial regions , i.e. @xmath8 may include an additional slow dependence on the location in space : @xmath12 . in order to fit observations , any theoretical source of dm should reproduce properties of the bias function @xmath8 in detail .    in the linear gravity , the bias relation ( [ br2 ] )",
    "can be interpreted as a modification of the newton law : @xmath13 the asymptotically flat rotation curves in galaxies require that the correction to the newton s potential should be logarithmic , i.e. the gravitational acceleration should switch from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "this , according to ( [ br3 ] ) , implies @xmath16 , or @xmath17 at galaxy scales .",
    "in fact , observations suggest the same behavior of @xmath18 for much larger scales ( kirillov 2006 ) .",
    "indeed , the distribution of the luminous mass shows characteristically fractal behavior : the mass @xmath19 within the ball of radius @xmath20 grows , essentially , as @xmath21 with @xmath22 on distances up to at least @xmath23mpc ( pietronero 1987 ; ruffini , song & taraglio 1988 , labini , montuori & pietronero 1998 ) .",
    "the bias function ( [ br4 ] ) leads then to @xmath24 , i.e. to a homogeneous distribution of the dm and , hence , of the total mass .",
    "thus , bias ( [ br4 ] ) is just one that reconciles the two seemingly contradictory observational facts : the fractal distribution of baryons with the dimension @xmath22 and the large - scale homogeneity of the metric .",
    "a theoretical scheme capable of explaining the origin of such bias was proposed in ( kirillov 1999 , kirillov & turaev 2002 ) .",
    "it was shown there that processes involving topology changes during the quantum stage of the evolution of the universe unavoidably ( and , in fact , model - independently ) lead to a scale - dependent renormalization of the constant of gravity @xmath25 , and this effect can be imitated by the emergence of dm , whose distribution is linearly related to the distribution of actual matter .",
    "importantly , assuming the thermal equilibrium during the quantum stage predicts in almost unique way a very specific form of the bias function ( kirillov & turaev 2002 ; kirillov 2003 ) @xmath26where @xmath27 @xmath28 has the meaning of the primordial temperature at which the topology has been tempered and @xmath29 is the mass of primordial scalar particles if they do exist .",
    "this means that at scales @xmath30 the bias becomes the constant @xmath31 and the standard newton s law restores .",
    "however at galaxy scales it should be @xmath32 and in what follows we take @xmath33 in ( [ b3 ] ) . and",
    ", therefore , @xmath34 .",
    "however so far scalar particles have not been observed which makes us think that scalar fields are not more but phenomenological objects . ]",
    "thus in the coordinate representation the bias takes the form @xmath35bias ( [ b3 ] ) is of form ( [ br4 ] ) , so it predicts the logarithmic correction to the newton s potential for a point source : @xmath36  at @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( see for details kirillov & turaev 2002 ; kirillov 2006 ) .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath39 plays the role of the scale at which dm starts to show up , so in galaxies it has to be estimated as a few kpc .",
    "as bias ( [ b3 ] ) has a thermodynamical origin , there have to be certain fluctuations in the value of @xmath39 ( this effect is analyzed in the next section ) .    in the present letter",
    "we demonstrate that bias ( [ b3 ] ) , ( [ b4 ] ) gives a very good agreement with the empirical urc constructed in pss and , therefore , it seems to be reasonable to believe that the nontrivial topological structure of the universe gives indeed a correct explanation to the dm phenomenon .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 in ( [ b4 ] ) has the meaning of the temperature at which the topology has been tempered ( kirillov & turaev 2002 ; kirillov , 2003 ) .",
    "we expect that in the very early universe it had the order of the planck temperature @xmath40 ( recall that at @xmath41 quantum gravity effects are thought to dominate ) .",
    "when , on the further stages of the universe evolution , topology changes were suppressed , this parameter evolved as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the scale factor .",
    "note , however , that the present value of @xmath27 has the sense of the primordial temperature . as it is extremely small : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the temperature of cmb radiation ( @xmath46 ) , we have to admit the existence of a specific phase in the past when the nontrivial topological structure might decay ( kirillov 2002 , 2003 ) , causing a certain re - heating of matter . during the decay phase , @xmath47 was a decreasing function of time , i.e. the scale @xmath38 , that corresponds to the cross - over from the standard newton s law to the logarithmic behavior of the potential of a point mass , grew faster than the scale factor @xmath48 .",
    "note that the homogeneity of the universe requires the total mass distribution ( luminous plus dark components ) to have a constant density in space . with the bias of form ( [ b3 ] ) , ( [ b4 ] ) , this corresponds to a fractal distribution of baryons ( kirillov 2002 , 2003 ) , i.e. the number of baryons within the sphere of a radius @xmath49 behaves as @xmath50 with @xmath22 , while for @xmath51 @xmath39 the fractal distribution is unstable ( for the newton s law restores and baryons dominate over the dm ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath52 allows one to assume that in the very early universe there was a moment @xmath53 when @xmath54 @xmath55 , i.e. baryons had the fractal distribution ( [ frd ] ) at all scales . after the topology decay phase , as the scale @xmath56 `` jumps '' towards a new , higher value ,",
    "the fractal distribution is preserved at scales larger than @xmath39 , but it becomes unstable on smaller scales .",
    "the instability develops and baryons under a certain scale of order @xmath39 start to redistribute , governed by newtonian dynamics .",
    "this means that we can relate @xmath39 to the scale of galaxy formation .",
    "then , according to ( [ frd ] ) , we should expect the number of baryons in a galaxy to be @xmath57 with the values of @xmath39 and @xmath58 corresponding to the moment when a galaxy started to form .",
    "note , however , that during the formation of a galaxy the value of @xmath59 switches off from the hubble expansion ( kirillov 2006 ) , i.e. law ( [ nbtf ] ) remains valid for the present - time values of @xmath60 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is easy to see that this relation leads directly to the tully - fisher law @xmath61 ( tully & fisher 1977 ) , where @xmath62 is the luminosity and @xmath63 is the rotation velocity of a galaxy .",
    "indeed , recall that @xmath64 fluctuates in space : small spatial fluctuations of the primordial temperature @xmath27 ( @xmath65 @xmath66 ) represent seeds for the present - time scatter in the local value of @xmath67 in different galaxies .",
    "accordingly , the masses of galaxies @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 is the baryon mass ) fluctuate as @xmath70 this fixes the choice of @xmath71 in the bias ( [ b3 ] ) , ( [ b4 ] ) for any given galaxy . sufficiently far from the center",
    ", the galaxy can be considered as a point - like object , so ( [ br3]),([b3 ] ) yield the following law for the gravitational acceleration at a sufficient distance from the edge of the optical disc : @xmath72as @xmath73 , the tully - fisher relation for the asymptotic rotation velocity @xmath74 follows now from ( [ nl ] ) , ( [ mutf ] ) : @xmath75with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus , in our interpretation of the dm , the tully - fisher law reduces to relation ( [ mutf ] ) which , in turn , can be read as an indication of the fractality of the primordial distribution of baryons with the dimension @xmath22 ( see ( [ frd ] ) ) .",
    "let us now compute the rotation curve ( rc ) of a galaxy modeled by an infinitely thin disk with surface mass density distribution @xmath78 . from ( [ br1 ] ) , ( [ b4 ] ) , we find for the dm halo density ( we use the notations @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) @xmath81where @xmath82 lies on the plane @xmath83 , while @xmath84 is the 3-dimensional vector . for the sake of convenience we present the fourier transform @xmath85where @xmath86 is the step function : @xmath87 for @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is the ( non - dark ) mass of the galaxy .",
    "first of all we note that this distribution is quite consistent with the observed cored distribution ( gentile et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "indeed , in the central region of the galaxy @xmath92 while for @xmath93 we find @xmath94 if we neglect the oscillating term and compare this with the pseudo - isothermal halo @xmath95 we find for the core radius @xmath96 according to pss , the core radius can be estimated as @xmath97 with @xmath98 , which makes @xmath99 a certain function of the luminosity .",
    "consider now circular velocities predicted by the above mass distributions . for the disk contribution to the equilibrium circular velocity , we get pss @xmath100and for the dark halo contribution we find from ( [ dhf ] ) the expression @xmath101where @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 are the bessel and the modified bessel functions and @xmath105 .",
    "thus for the rotation curve we find the expression @xmath106 as we see , the shape of the rotation curve depends indeed on one parameter @xmath107 . via relation ( [ r ] ) , or equivalently ( [ av ] ) , @xmath99 is expressed as a function of the total number of baryons @xmath60 in the galaxy ; there is , however , an uncertainty in @xmath99 due to the variation of the ratio @xmath108 for different galaxies . at the moment of the galaxy formation @xmath109 which corresponds to the same initial value @xmath110 in all galaxies . on subsequent stages of",
    "the evolution @xmath107 becomes different in different objects .",
    "indeed in smaller galaxies supernovae are more efficient in removing the gas from the central ( stellar forming ) region of a galaxy than in bigger galaxies ( e.g. , see shankar et al . , 2006 and references therein ) and this creates the fact that in smaller objects the disc has a smaller baryonic density ( a lower surface brightness ) and the ratio @xmath111 .    to compare expression ( [ urc ] ) with that from pss we rewrite it as @xmath112 where @xmath113 corresponds to the optical radius of a galaxy",
    "the plot of this curve for different values of @xmath99 is presented in fig.1 .",
    "while the similarity of our rc ( [ urc1 ] ) with the empirical urc of pss is quite good , we note that the topological bias ( [ b4 ] ) predicts a new feature in rotation curves ",
    "specific oscillations in the dm density with the characteristic wavelength @xmath114 ( or in dimensional units @xmath115 ) .",
    "indeed at a sufficient distance from the edge of the optical disc ( i.e. , as @xmath116 ) a galaxy can be considered as a point - like object .",
    "then from ( [ nl ] ) for the rotation velocity we find the expression@xmath117which shows the presence of a specific oscillations with the decaying amplitude @xmath118 .",
    "such oscillations are , in turn , rather difficult ( though possible ) to extract from observations . indeed in the case of hsb ( high surface brightness )",
    "galaxies when @xmath119 ( i.e. , for rather long periods @xmath120 ) the expression ( [ urc2 ] ) gives a very good quantitative approximation to the exact formula ( [ urc1 ] ) starting already from @xmath121 .",
    "however the reliable rc data available extend usually not more than to @xmath122 . in this range oscillations are not established yet and the beginning of oscillations is seen ( e.g. , see fig.1 . ) as not flat rc slopes .",
    "the slopes observed are known to take values between @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( e.g. , see pss ) .",
    "in the case of lsb galaxies @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) , the amplitude of oscillations is somewhat suppressed @xmath127 and the small amount of the stellar mass in the range @xmath128 considerably smooths such oscillations which results in a some deviation of ( [ urc2 ] ) from the exact expression ( [ urc1 ] ) . moreover , in deriving ( [ urc1 ] ) we do not take into account the presence of gas which due to supernovae does not trace the brightness , i.e. , it deviates the exponential profile .",
    "essentially this is true for lsb galaxies .",
    "thus , to observe such oscillations we have either to measure velocities for sufficiently large distances @xmath129 ( e.g. , for hsb ) , or to improve the accuracy of available observational data in lsb .",
    "as it can be seen from fig.1 , the topological bias ( [ b3 ] ) predicted in ( kirillov & turaev 2002 ; kirillov 2003 ) shows quite a good agreement with observations .",
    "indeed , it repeats all features of the empirical urc of pss : the amount of dm progressively increases with the decrease of the luminosity ( cf .",
    "pss ) , dm shows the cored distribution ( cf .",
    "gentile et al . , 2004 ) with the strong correlation ( [ a ] ) between the core radius and the disk size ( cf .",
    "donato , et al . , 2004 ) , and the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) is explicitly present ( see ( [ av ] ) ) .",
    "there is no doubt that the tuning of a single free parameter @xmath108 allows to fit any rc .",
    "at least , it is claimed in ( e.g. , see milgrom & sanders 2005 and references therein ) for the rcs obtained via milgrom algorithm mond ( milgrom 1983 ) , and our rcs are phenomenologically quite close to those , although the physics in our approach is completely different . in this respect",
    "we can claim that the topological bias gives a rigorous basis for applying the mond - type algorithm in galaxies ( which however allows for the tully - fisher relation to have @xmath130 ) .",
    "therefore , there is enough evidence that bias ( [ br1 ] ) , ( [ b4 ] ) gives an adequate description of galaxies .",
    "we repeat that our approach produces as good fit to the observed rcs as the milgrom algorithm ( known to be quite successful empirically ( milgrom & sanders 2005 , see however gentile et al .",
    "2004 , donato et al . 2004 ) ) can do .",
    "however , contrary to mond , our theory remains linear in weak fields , and the superposition of forces holds .",
    "in fact , our approach does not presume any modification of the theory and basic equations : there is actually no modification of gravity , while the bias appears merely as a result of a disagreement between the actual topology of the physical space and that of the flat space ( e.g. , see sec . 2 in kirillov 2006 ) .",
    "thus , there are all reasons to believe that the dm phenomenon has indeed the topological origin .",
    "once we accept the topological origin of the bias ( [ br1 ] ) , ( [ b4 ] ) , the tully - fisher relation @xmath131with @xmath132 serves as a strong indication of the fractal behavior in the primordial distribution of baryons with the dimension @xmath22 .",
    "such fractal distribution changes essentially the estimate for the baryon number density in the universe ( e.g. , see kirillov 2006 ) .",
    "the currently accepted post - wmap cosmology has ( roughly ) : @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 , which implies @xmath137 .",
    "we stress that such estimates are model dependent , for they are strongly based on the standard model ( e.g. , the content , evolution , the homogeneity of the baryon distribution , the power law of initial spectrum of perturbations , etc . ) and fix an arbitrary model @xmath138 , we find in a unique way the initial primordial spectrum of @xmath139 . to fix the model we have to know both the measured @xmath140 and the initial values of @xmath141 which a priori are unknown . ]",
    ". moreover , the direct count of the number of baryons gives @xmath142 for the whole nearby universe out to the radius @xmath143 ( e.g. , see persic & salucci , 1992 ) , which means that in the standard cosmological models most of baryons are somewhere hidden .",
    "when the topological bias is accepted such estimates require essential revision . indeed , according to ( [ b3 ] )",
    "the topological bias modifies the newton s law in the range of scales @xmath144 where the equilibrium distribution of baryons has the fractal behavior . on scales",
    "@xmath145 the standard newton s law restores ( and baryons cross over to the homogeneity ) but dynamically every particle becomes heavier in @xmath146 times , which gives for the effective dm fraction @xmath147 @xmath146 .",
    "the scale @xmath148 is directly measured in galaxies by rcs and is estimated as a few kpc . however the mean value @xmath149 for the homogeneous universe should be @xmath150 times bigger ( kirillov 2006 ) .",
    "the maximal scale @xmath151 is the scale where the primordial fractal distribution of baryons crosses over to the homogeneity .",
    "this scale is not so easy to measure without a detailed investigation .",
    "indeed , the large - scale structure , e.g. , the existence of huge ( @xmath152 ) voids with no galaxies inside and thin ( @xmath153 ) walls filled with galaxies , fits quite well into the fractal picture and suggests only the lower boundary @xmath154 .",
    "this gives for the dm fraction @xmath155 which is consistent with the observed value @xmath156 .",
    "however the maximal possible value @xmath157 ( @xmath158 is the hubble radius ) which gives @xmath159 can not be excluded . to avoid misunderstanding",
    "we stress that the topological nature of the bias makes the fractal distribution to be equilibrium and consistent with the homogeneity of the metric and the observed cmb fluctuations @xmath140 ( e.g. , see kirillov 2006 ) .",
    "the topological nature means that the same bias appears in all interactions .",
    "if the bias would not modify the electromagnetic field , then the fractal distribution of baryons would be in a severe conflict with observations and surely had to be rejected as it does take place in the standard models ( e.g. , the fractal distribution produces too strong fluctuations @xmath140 @xmath160 ) .",
    "the topological nature of the bias however creates the fact that the coulomb force and all green functions are also modified at galaxy scales ( kirillov & turaev 2002 , kirillov 2006 ) which reduces @xmath161 to the observed value @xmath162",
    "@xmath163 @xmath164 ( e.g. , for sufficiently remote objects @xmath165 the apparent luminosity has to behave as @xmath166 instead of @xmath167 which gives for the number of objects brighter than @xmath168 somewhat higher ( with respect to @xmath169 ) value @xmath170 ) .",
    "thus the topological bias and the observational definition of @xmath151 requires the careful and thorough revision of the standard model and all basic formulas .    in conclusion , we point out that bias ( [ b4 ] ) predicts the existence of specific oscillations in the distribution of dm with the characteristic wavelength @xmath171 . when the observational data allow , this can be used to verify the theory and , thus , to make a more definite conclusion on the nature of dm .",
