    "taken the importance of transportation networks in different types of natural and man - made structures the relevance of their stability against disturbances be they individual failures or complete breakdown is obvious . in turn",
    ", one may single out two main ingredients which determine this stability , these are ( _ i _ ) dynamical features of transport processes that take part on such networks , i.e. their fluctuating _ load _ and ( _ ii _ ) structural features of the networks themselves , i.e. their _ topology _ @xcite . whereas a comprehensive treatment of transportation network stability has to deal with both of these mentioned factors ,",
    "the complexity of the problem often calls for a separate account and analysis of each factor .",
    "moreover , recently network structure stability has become the subject of a separate field of research within complex network science , where the _ attack vulnerability _ of a complex network is treated by means of a combination of tools of random graph theory @xcite and those of percolation theory @xcite and statistical physics @xcite .",
    "the very notion of attack vulnerability of a complex network originates from earlier studies of computer networks and reflects the decrease of network performance as caused by the removal or dysfunction of either their nodes or links ( or both ) @xcite .",
    "the study of network vulnerability against failure or attack has conceptually much in common with studies of percolation and they gained a lot from concepts and insights in percolation theory .",
    "however , standard percolation theory @xcite deals with homogeneous lattices whereas the non - homogeneity of complex networks gives rise to a variety of phenomena which are particular for these structures . to give an example , the empirical analysis of numerous scale - free real - world networks ( the www and the internet @xcite , metabolic @xcite , food web @xcite , protein @xcite networks ) has revealed that these networks display an unexpectedly high degree of robustness under random failure .",
    "however , if the scenario is changed towards `` targeted '' attacks , the same networks may appear to be especially vulnerable @xcite .",
    "it is the non - homogeneity of networks that allows to choose different attack scenarios , i.e. to remove network links or nodes not at random , but following specific sequences prepared according to characteristics determining their ` importance ' . for vertex - targeted attacks ,",
    "the sequence may be ordered by decreasing vertex degree @xcite or betweenness centrality @xcite for the unperturbed network and the attack successively removes vertices according to this original sequence .",
    "one may further extend the above scenarios by recalculating the characteristics of the remaining vertices after each removal step and reordering the lists @xcite .",
    "former analysis has shown that attacks according to recalculated lists often turn out to be more effective @xcite .",
    "so far , the prevailing analytic results on complex network stability have been obtained for idealized models of infinite networks .",
    "in particular , important insight on network structure stability may be gained assuming that a complex network may perform its function as long as it possesses a giant connected component ( gcc ) i.e. a connected subnetwork which in the limit of an infinite network contains a finite fraction of the network . under this assumption",
    ", the network robustness may be judged using the molloy - reed criterion , which has been formulated for essentially treelike networks with a given node degree distribution @xmath3 but otherwise random linking between vertices .",
    "the criterion for a gcc to be present in such networks is @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 means the ensemble average over networks with given @xmath3 . defining the molloy - reed parameter as the ratio of the moments of the degree distribution @xmath6 one may rewrite ( [ 1 ] ) as : @xmath7 for an uncorrelated network the parameter @xmath8",
    "can be equally represented by the ratio between the mean number @xmath9 of next neighbors ( which is by definition equal to the mean node degree @xmath10 ) and the mean number @xmath11 of second nearest neighbors : @xmath12 in terms of @xmath13 , condition ( [ 3 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath14    for obvious reasons , relations ( [ 3 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) can not be directly applied to real - world networks , which usually are correlated and are of finite size . therefore ,",
    "an important issue which arises in the analysis of attack vulnerability of real - world networks is the choice of the observables which may be used to measure network stability . since the gcc is well - defined only for an infinite network , often the size of the largest network component @xmath15",
    "alternatively , one can estimate network stability from the average shortest path lengths or their inverse values @xcite . recently , a unique measure for robustness was introduced @xcite and has been used to devise a method to restructure a network and to make it more robust against a malicious attack . observing the normalised size @xmath0 of the largest component as function of the share @xmath1 of removed vertices or links a measure of stability is provided by the area a under the curve for the interval @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "we will normalise this value as @xmath16 here , the size of the largest component is normalised such that @xmath17 . in this respect",
    ", the measure captures the network reaction over the whole attack sequence .",
    "the goal of this paper is to elaborate criteria , which allow to give _ a priori _ information on the attack stability of real world correlated networks of finite size and to check how these criteria correspond to the analytic results available for the infinite uncorrelated networks . as a case study ,",
    "we consider public transportation networks ( ptn ) of several major cities of the world .",
    "this paper continues studies initiated in @xcite , where we have considered ptn attack vulnerability .",
    "the results presented below complement ref . @xcite by describing the effects of link - targeted attacks as well as by applying the above mentioned measure for network robustness @xcite to evaluate attack efficiency .    for the remaining part of the paper we will use the following set - up . in the next section",
    "we will shortly describe our ptn database , attack scenarios and the observables used to describe different features of the ptns considered here .",
    "results for the transportation network stability against node - targeted and link - targeted attacks will be given in sections [ iii ] and [ iv ] , correspondingly . in section [ v ]",
    "we present some observed correlations between ptn characteristics measured prior to attack and the ptn stability during attacks following different scenarios .",
    "discussions and outlook are presented in section [ vi ] .",
    "the systematic analysis of ptn using tools of complex network theory dates back to the early 2000-s @xcite and continues to this day @xcite .",
    "it has been revealed that these networks share common statistical properties : they appear to be strongly correlated small - world structures with high values of clustering coefficients and comparatively low mean shortest path values .",
    "the power - law node degree distributions observed for many ptn give strong evidence of correlations within these networks .",

    "this number of network nodes is to be related to comparatively low values for the mean and maximal shortest path . as mentioned above ,",

    "recall that the clustering coefficient @xmath31 of a given node @xmath32 is the ratio of the number of links @xmath33 between the @xmath34 nearest neighbours of node @xmath32 and the maximal possible number of mutual links between these : @xmath35 the values of @xmath22 quoted in table [ tab1 ] give convincing evidence for the presence of strong local correlations .    in our earlier work on the ptn resilience to attacks of different types we introduced different scenarios to remove network nodes or links , to model random failure or attack .",
    "however , the focus of that work was primarily on node - targeted attacks . in previous work",
    "@xcite , the present authors have shown that for ptns the most effective attack scenarios correspond to removing nodes @xmath32 either with highest degree @xmath34 or with highest betweenness centrality values @xmath36 . for a given node @xmath32 ,",

    "the results presented below show the outcome of node- and link - targeted attacks , where either nodes or links are removed following specific sequences corresponding to so - called scenarios . for node - targeted attacks we concentrate on five different scenarios , by selecting the nodes : ( i ) at random , ( ii ) according to their initial degree ( prior to the attack ) ( iii ) according to their degree recalculated",
    "after nodes of higher degree have been removed ( iv ) according to their initial betweenness centrality ( v ) according to their recalculated betweenness centrality .",
    "the same five scenarios are implemented for the link - targeted attacks . however , in this case one has to generalize the notions of node degree and betweenness centrality for links .",
    "we will define the degree @xmath41 of the link between nodes @xmath42 and @xmath39 with degrees @xmath34 and @xmath43 as : @xmath44 for the simple graph with two vertices and a single link , the link degree will be zero , @xmath45 , while for any link in a connected graph with more than two vertices the link degree will be at least one , @xmath46 .",

    "the two subsequent sections demonstrate how ptns react on attacks of the above described scenarios when these attacks are targeted on ptn nodes ( section [ iii ] ) and links ( section [ iv ] ) .",

    "the vulnerability behavior of the dallas ptn under link - targeted attacks appears not to differ from the corresponding random vertex removal approach . for paris",
    "the situation is quite different .",
    "the main observation is that initially the random vertex attack is more effective than any link - targeted attack , until breakdown and further , and only once the near to 50% of the links have been removed the recalculated link degree ( @xmath64 ) targeted scenario starts to be more harmful . comparing different link - targeted scenarios one notices similar behavior between these",
    ", only the recalculated degree scenario line initially decays slower , however to become more effective near to the breakdown . in the following section",
    "we will compare outcomes of node- and link - targeted attacks in more detail .",
    "the special behaviour of the recalculated link degree behaviour may be explained as follows : in each removal step the links with highest link degrees are removed , however , these may belong to a number of different nodes .",
    "the affected nodes will therefore remain , however , with lower degrees .",
    "after recalculation the links on these nodes affected in the last step will have moved to lower places in the ordered list such that other links will be affected .",
    "this will continue until the degrees of all nodes have been reduced to three or less . at that point",
    "the removal of almost any link will cut down the connected component and a rapid breakdown of the largest component takes place .",
    "when the sequence for the removal of links is calculated using the initial degrees of the vertices , then obviously in the first 1% step a set of all links connected to the highest degree vertices are removed which is approximately equivalent to removing the corresponding 1% of all highest degree nodes . as far as no recalculation",
    "is involved the second step will essentially cut the links off the second 1% of highest degree nodes . disregarding correlations between these operations one may therefore expect that the initial link and node degree scenarios result in  similar breakdown behaviour .",

    "another observation is that attacks performed according to the lists of nodes recalculated after each step of the attack scenario appear to be more effective than those performed according to the lists prepared prior to the attack .",
    "moreover , this difference is much more pronounced for the highest betweenness centrality targeted nodes as for those with highest node degree .",
    "on the other hand , for link - targeted attacks the most effective appear to be the highest link degree targeted attacks according to the recalculated ( ptn of berlin , dallas , dsseldorf , istanbul , london , moscow , paris ) or initial ( rome , sapaolo ) lists of links . only for the ptn of hamburg , hong kong , taipei , and sydney the highest betweenness centrality scenario appears to be the most effective , however even in this case",
    "the difference between different scenarios is not much pronounced .",

    "it is interesting to mention that for three ptn ( hamburg , istanbul , sydney ) which are not very resilient against any kind of attacks ( however not for ptn of dallas , which is least ) , most efficient is the scenario of removing links with initial highest values of the betweenness centrality @xmath66 .",

    "[ fig7]*a * and [ fig7]*b * we show the correlation between the fitted node - degree distribution exponent @xmath24 and @xmath70 for the random and recalculated node degree scenarios .",
    "one observes a notable tendency to find ptns with smaller values of @xmath24 to be more resilient as indicated by larger values of @xmath70 .",
    "this tendency holds even if we include the ptns which are better described by the exponential decay of the node - degree distributions .",
    "in this paper we have presented an empirical analysis of the reaction of ptns of different cities of the world upon random failure or directed attack scenarios",
    ". there may be numerous reasons for individual failure , ranging from a random accident to a targeted destruction .",

    "our analysis is motivated by practical interest in the stability of individual ptns thereby comparing the operating features of different ptns . on the other hand we were seeking to identify criteria , which allow to judge _ a priori _ on the attack stability of real world correlated networks of finite size checking how do these criteria correspond to the analytic results available for the infinite uncorrelated networks .    to perform the present analysis we have used previously accumulated @xcite data on ptns of several major cities of the world",
    "( see table [ tab1 ] ) and simulated attacks of different scenarios targeted on the ptn nodes and links . to quantify the ptn stability to attacks of different scenarios we use a recently introduced @xcite numerical measure of network robustness . in our case",

    "the measure captures the overall resilient behavior over the complete attack sequence .",
    "table [ tab2 ] allows to compare the robustness of a given ptn to attacks of different scenarios as well as to compare the relative robustness of different ptns .    the comparison of ptn characteristics measured _ prior _ to the attack with the ptn robustness monitoring its behaviour _ during _ the attack allowed us to propose criteria that allow an a priori estimate of ptn robustness and stability with respect to an attack .",
