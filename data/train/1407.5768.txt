    "the visualization of features of a physical system which have no counterpart in classical statistical physics has attracted increasing interest . the most prominent nonclassical phenomenon in multidimensional systems is entanglement , which is a key resource for quantum technologies such as quantum computation and quantum teleportation  @xcite . however , that the generation of an entangled state of the radiation field in the output beams of a beam splitter necessarily requires one input field to be prepared in a nonclassical state  @xcite .",
    "hence it is a subject of great importance to have powerful and general criteria to certify the nonclassicality of a given quantum state .",
    "an established definition of nonclassicality of the radiation field is based on the glauber - sudarshan representation of the quantum state  @xcite , @xmath1 in terms of coherent states @xmath2 , which are closely related to the classical behavior .",
    "if the @xmath0  function has the properties of a classical probability density , then eq .  ( [ eq : p - repr ] ) corresponds to a classical mixture of the ( almost classical ) coherent states .",
    "such quantum states are called classical ones , for nonclassical states @xmath3 fails to have the properties of a probability density  @xcite . for a large number of quantum states the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0  function can have negativities .",
    "such states exhibit quantum effects arising from quantum superpositions of coherent states  @xcite ; their properties are unknown in classical physics . in general",
    ", @xmath3 is highly singular , so that it is often impossible to reconstruct it from experiments in order to certify the nonclassicality of a given quantum state .",
    "even if the @xmath0  function is well behaved  @xcite , its experimental reconstruction requires some _ a priori _ knowledge of the set of possible states in the considered physical system . in such cases ,",
    "a cutoff of the fourier transform of the characteristic function must be properly chosen  @xcite in order to suppress the experimental sampling noise effects .    a universal method for verifying nonclassicality introduces a regularized @xmath0  function by applying a so - called nonclassicality filter  @xcite .",
    "negativities of this regularized function are proof of the nonclassicality of the state .",
    "in contrast to the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0  function , it is a regular function for any quantum state and can , in general , be reconstructed from experimental data .",
    "this filtering procedure is a very efficient technique since it only requires the optimization of three real parameters .",
    "other nonclassicality criteria , for example nonclassicality conditions  @xcite derived from the bochner criterion  @xcite or criteria using normally ordered moments  @xcite , in general require an infinite number of conditions to certify nonclassicality .",
    "special signatures of nonclassicality , such as a sub - poisson photon statistics  @xcite , quadrature squeezing  @xcite , or negative values of the wigner function  @xcite , identify only the nonclassicality of a subset of all nonclassical states .",
    "the practicability of the nonclassicality filtering has been demonstrated in different experiments  @xcite .",
    "little attention has been paid so far to the following question : which filter needs a minimal number of experimental data points to obtain significant negativities of the experimentally reconstructed regularized @xmath0  function ?    in the present paper",
    "we study known two types of such filters can even be given in an analytic form , which is advantageous for the practical application in experiments .",
    "we compare different filters to identify the optimal strategy for uncovering quantum effects of a given system .",

    "the glauber - sudarshan leads to a singular @xmath0  function .",
    "the regularization of this function is based on the multiplication of the characteristic function with a filter @xmath5 before the fourier transform is carried out .",
    "this leads to the regularized @xmath0  function  @xcite , @xmath6 which is also referred to as filtered @xmath0  function or nonclassicality quasiprobability . for classical states",
    "any choice of @xmath7 yields a nonnegative function @xmath8 .",
    "exists such that @xmath8 has negativities , directly revealing the nonclassicality .    the filter function @xmath5 , appearing in eq .  , has to be chosen in a special way .",
    "it is important that the filtered quasiprobability @xmath9 can visualize the quantumness of any nonclassical state .",
    "in addition , the filter must suppress the sampling noise of the measured data .    _",
    "condition 1_. @xmath10 is square integrable for all @xmath11 .",
    "this guarantees that the nonclassicality quasiprobability is a regular function for any quantum state .",
    "moreover , it fully suppresses the experimental sampling noise in the characteristic function of the @xmath0  function .    _",
    "condition 2_. negative values of @xmath8 should only arise from the nonclassicality of the state and not from the filter procedure itself .",
    "therefore , the fourier transform of @xmath5 has to be nonnegative for all @xmath11 .    _",
    "condition 3_. @xmath12 and @xmath13 , so @xmath9 is a real function and @xmath14 .    _",
    "condition 4_. if @xmath7 tends to infinity , @xmath9 has to approach the original glauber - sudarshan @xmath0  function , which implies that @xmath15 must hold .",
    "a function satisfying _ conditions 1 _ - _ 4 _ is referred to as a nonclassicality filter  @xcite .",
    "if the quantum state is completely known , i.e. , if it is , for example , given by its density operator or its characteristic function , it is useful to add another condition .    _",
    "condition 5_. @xmath16 for all @xmath17 and @xmath11 .",
    "this ensures that the regularized @xmath0  function represents all quantum states uniquely , without any loss of information .",
    "if a nonclassicality filter satisfies this condition , we refer to it as an invertible nonclassicality filter . for sampling the regularized @xmath0  function from data points .",
    "it is advantageous to use radial symmetric filters since the sampling formulas for the reconstruction of the regularized @xmath0  function from quadrature or photon number data are easier to handle in this case .",
    "therefore , we add a further requirement .    _",
    "condition 6_. @xmath18 . together with _",
    "condition 3 _ , one infers that @xmath5 is a real function in this case .      in the following",
    "we will give a brief overview of presently known nonclassicality filters , and we will introduce another analytical nonclassicality filter .",
    "one possibility to construct nonclassicality filters is based on the autocorrelation function , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gamma function . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , function   is a nonclassicality filter for @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding quasiprobability then reads @xmath22 in the case @xmath23 one recovers the well - known @xmath24-parametrized quasiprobabilities , such as the wigner function ( @xmath25 ) or the husimi @xmath26  function ( @xmath27 )  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath28 , however , the quasiprobability can still be highly singular for some states , which renders an experimental reconstruction impossible .",
    "thus , this gaussian filter violates _ condition 1 _ and is , therefore , not a nonclassicality filter .    in the limiting case @xmath29",
    ", we obtain the analytical expression @xmath30\\mathrm{rect}\\left(\\dfrac{|\\beta|}{4w}\\right),\\ ] ] with @xmath31 under more general conditions , for @xmath32 , the filters @xmath33 must be determined numerically .",
    "this implies some partial loss of information on the detailed structure of the quantum states under study  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : autq ] shows the linear and logarithmic shapes of these filters along the radial direction in phase space , for various values of @xmath34",
    ". the parameter @xmath34 mainly controls the decay of @xmath33 for @xmath35 , which becomes stronger with increasing @xmath34 . in",
    "the following sections we will see that this @xmath34-dependent decay behavior exceedingly determines the statistical significance of the negativities of the experimentally reconstructed regularized @xmath0  functions .",
    "an important question arises : for which @xmath34 values does a minimal number of experimental data points suffice to reach a reasonable statistical significance of the visualized nonclassicality ?",
    "we will deal with this question in sec .",

    "<S> nonclassicality filters provide a universal method to visualize the nonclassicality of arbitrary quantum states of light through negativities of a regularized glauber - sudarshan @xmath0  function , also denoted as nonclassicality quasiprobability . </S>",
    "<S> such filters are introduced and analyzed for optimizing the experimental certification of nonclassical effects . </S>",
    "<S> an analytic filter is constructed which preserves the full information on the quantum state . for balanced homodyne detection , the number of data points is analyzed to get the negativities of the nonclassicality quasiprobability with high statistical significance . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applied to different scenarios , such as phase randomized squeezed vacuum states , single - photon - added thermal states , and heralded state engineering with array detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the generalization to visualize quantum correlations of multimode radiation fields is also considered . </S>",
