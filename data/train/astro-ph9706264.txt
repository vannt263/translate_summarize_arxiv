    "these studies are important for understanding the physics of the broad - line region ( blr ) since fe  ii is a major , and sometimes the dominant coolant of the blr ( e.g. phillips 1977 , 1978 ; miley & miller 1979 ; bergeron & kunth 1984 ; joly 1981 ; lipari , terlevich , & macchetto 1993 ) .",

    "the rest frame positions of various lines are marked above the spectrum .",

    "we make no attempt here to identify the many fe  ii emission blends present . the various fe  ii multiplets designated in fig.2 are taken from moore ( 1952 ) , and serve only as an illustration of possible fe  ii features .",
    "the number of possible fe  ii multiplets is extremely large , and a reliable identification requires detailed theoretical calculations , which are beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "the spectrum was obtained in a single exposure and is affected by cosmic ray hits , which were deleted by taking out 5 small patches ( width 1 - 2   ) from the spectrum .",
    "the absolute flux calibration is not secure .",
    "the wavelength zero point was set using ca ii  @xmath36 galactic interstellar medium absorption lines .",
    "since the hst wavelength zero point is also based on low ionization species ( si  ii , al  ii , fe  ii ) , it probably matches well the optical spectrum zero point . the hst fos g270h spectrum which overlaps with the optical spectrum in the 3183    to 3280    region is also shown in fig.2d , shifted down by a factor of 0.37 in log flux .",
    "apart from the flux discrepancy , the spectral features match very well .",

    "these parameters were measured by fitting a set of gaussians to each emission feature , as described in laor et al .",
    "( 1994a , 1995 ) . in strongly blended features , or in very weak features ,",
    "some of the emission parameters could not be measured reliably , and are therefore not listed .",
    "we preferred not to assign errors to the measured parameters since such errors may not be very meaningful given the very complicated overall spectrum and the subjectivity of both the placement of the continuum and separation of blended features .",
    "figure 3 presents a comparison of an  profile to the observed profile of most of the strong emission features .",
    "direct comparison of line profiles is not meaningful in most cases since most lines are strongly blended ( despite their narrow profile in ) .",
    "the comparison is therefore made using a template profile , which allows us to test if the observed profile can be reconstructed with a sum of template components representing the various lines which may contribute to the blend .",
    "for the template we use the high s / n spectrum of  obtained for  as part of the bg92 study .",
    "the  line is used since it has the highest s / n , and is least blended . the wavelength used to set the velocity scale",
    "is given in each sub - panel .",
    "most features are blends , and in each subpanel we list the ratio of fluxes in the blend components assumed in the fit . when searching for the best fit we allowed the continuum level to be below the apparent continuum level , since the observed continuum may be contaminated by weak unresolved emission ( see in particular the mg  ii doublet fit , discussed in  3.1.5 ) .",
    "note that the  profile is slightly asymmetric with some excess flux on the blue wing ( e.g. see the c  iv 1/1 doublet fit ) .",

    "alternatively , this feature may be just another fe  ii feature , many of which are scattered throughout the spectrum .",
    "however , we find the he  ii identification more likely since c  iv and n  v also display large blue shifts ( @xmath41 ) , and the he  ii velocity shift is typically twice that of c  iv ( e.g. laor et al .",
    "1995 , table 7 ) .",
    "in addition the he  ii/  flux ratio of @xmath42 measured using the 1629.5    feature is typical of quasars ( e.g. laor et al .",

    "however , since the he  ii  @xmath5 line is very broad and asymmetric , the he  ii  @xmath40 upper limit may have been somewhat underestimated , while some of the flux attributed to he  ii  @xmath46 may be due to blended fe  ii features . therefore , the @xmath47 does not provide a useful contraint on the reddening .",

    "resonance scattering of continuum photons may also contribute significantly to the c  iii@xmath48 emission if the velocity dispersion within the blr clouds is large enough ( ferguson , ferland & pradhan 1995 ; laor et al .",

    "the [ c  iii ]  @xmath59 line may be present in .",

    "kwan & krolik ( 1981 ) have found that @xmath89 can increase from unity to 1.3 due to balmer continuum absorption of @xmath76 photons , and the production of @xmath84 photons by collisional excitation of o  i ions in the @xmath82 level . a third mechanism which can increase @xmath89 , noted by grandi ( 1983 ) , is the significant probability for a @xmath90 @xmath91 semi - forbidden transition for @xmath92 , or equivalently @xmath93 , which would further increase @xmath89 .",
    "kwan ( 1984 ) included the o  i ]  @xmath91 transition and indeed found @xmath94 , where most of the increase from unity is due to the `` re - routing '' of @xmath76 photons to @xmath91 .",

    "a specific template deblending is shown in fig.3 , using  as a template , which implies a si  iv / o  iv ] flux ratio of 1/2 .",
    "however , this ratio is not well constrained since the intrinsic line profile is probably not symmetric , as suggested by the large observed blue excess flux , and the fact that all other high ionization lines display a strong blue excess flux ( see  3.2 ) .",

    "observed he  ii  @xmath5 flux the absorber must absorb most photons just above the he  ii bound - free edge at 4  rydberg . as described above , when @xmath260  @xmath25 the uv absorber is within a factor of three of the column density required to form an `` he  ii '' region , i.e. it absorbs @xmath261 of he  ii ionizing photons , and thus if the column density of the uv absorber is close to the upper limit , and its covering factor is close to unity , it may contribute significantly to the observed he  ii  @xmath5 emission .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray absorber becomes optically thick below 0.2  kev .",
    "it is therefore highly optically thick at 4  rydberg and can produce the observed he  ii  @xmath5 emission if its covering factor is reasonably large ( @xmath262% ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that oke & lauer ( 1979 ) found evidence for [ o  iii ]  @xmath263 and [ ne  iii ] @xmath264 emission components at @xmath265 which corresponds to a @xmath266  blueshift with respect to the @xmath28 used here .",
    "the same feature was also noted by van groningen ( 1993 ) in a high spectral resolution profile of [ o  iii ] @xmath263 .",
    "if these emission components also originate in the uv absorber then their flux can be used as an additional constraint on the density , column density , and ionization parameter of the uv absorber .",
    "higher spectral resolution observations of the  n  v and c  iv absorption lines would allow a much more accurate determination of the absorption profile , and thus of the absorber s column .",
    "if the h  i column density is indeed close to the upper limit , as required to `` unite '' the uv absorption , x - ray absorption , and he  ii emission , then the  absorption profile , for example , would appear as a @xmath267  wide , steep sided , and flat bottomed trough going down to zero flux .",
    "the metal absorption lines should also be resolved as deep narrow optically thick absorption lines with damping wings .",
    "if the absorption lines remain shallow and broad then the lower limits to the absorbing columns would apply .",
    "the metal lines absorption doublet ratios can be used to establish the covering factor of the uv absorber .",
    "higher s / n x - ray spectra below 0.5  kev are required to establish whether the soft x - ray absorption hinted at by the _ rosat _ pspc is indeed real .",
    "the strong optical fe  ii emission of , its weak [ o  iii ] emission , strong ir emission , and `` red '' uv continuum are all typical properties of low ionization broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ; weymann et al .",
    "1991 , boroson & meyers 1992 ; sprayberry & foltz 1992 ) .",
    "the presence of weak uv absorption at a blueshift of @xmath4   in  suggests it may be a `` failed '' low ionization balqso , i.e. a balqso where our line of sight just grazes the outflowing high ionization wind , and misses the low ionization outflow , as suggested by turnshek et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in the case of pg  0043 + 039 .    is the red continuum , excess blue flux in the high ionization lines , associated absorption , and dense blr , unique to , or are they typical uv properties of narrow line quasars ?",
    "no complete uv study of narrow line agns is available to answer these questions , but some hints may be obtained from existing observations ( see also discussion in lawrence et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "baldwin et al . ( 1996 ) studied the emission line properties of a heterogeneous sample of seven @xmath268 quasars with a range of emission line properties .",
    "some of their objects have strong fe  ii , fe  iii , and al  iii emission as observed in .",
    "baldwin et al . analyzed in detail the uv spectrum of q@xmath269 , where a high s / n ratio was available , and found excess emission in the blue wing of the high ionization uv lines , which they interpreted as a high ionization outflowing component in the blr , although there was no direct evidence ( through absorption ) for such a component , as probably observed in .",
    "it is also interesting to note that bg92 found that strong optical fe  ii emitting quasars , which tend to have narrow , also tend to have blue excess flux in , and boroson & meyers found that low ionization balqsos , which are generally  like , have blue excess flux in .",
    "it is not known , however , whether this property extends to the uv lines as well .    if the uv absorption system in  is indeed producing the blueshifted components of the high ionization lines , then the absence of a corresponding redshifted component indicates that the far side of this outflow has to be obscured .",
    "this may either be due to an extended highly optically thick gas , such as an accretion disk , or it may result from absorption within each cloud , if the clouds column density is large enough ( see ferland et al .",
    "1992 for discussion ) .",
    "the doublet ratios observed here indicate that the low ionization lines are thermalized and will not be emitted isotropically .",
    "however , the large velocity gradients in the wind may strongly reduce the optical depth for the high ionization lines in the wind . the observed blueshifted emission in c  iv and n",
    "v is far too broad to determine the observed doublet ratio and can not be used to determine if the emission from that gas is optically thick or thin .",
    "has particularly weak c  iii ]  @xmath270 emission (  3.1.2 ) but normal si  iii ]  @xmath271 emission , which we interpret here as evidence for a relatively dense ( @xmath272  ) blr , at least for the region which produces the the low ionization lines .",
    "baldwin et al . ( 1988 ) noted the weakness of c  iii ]  @xmath270 in four other quasars with narrow uv lines , and this trend is also apparent in baldwin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) quasars .",
    "the most extreme case is of h@xmath273 where essentially no c  iii ]  @xmath270 emission was observed ( hartig & baldwin 1986 ) .",
    "this quasar has very narrow lines , and is also a low ionization balqso .",
    "independent evidence for a dense blr with @xmath10  is provided by the significant ew and thermalized doublet ratio of the al  iii  @xmath1 doublet (  3.1.6 ) , and by the significant ew of c  iii@xmath48 (  3.1.2 ) .",
    "another indication for a dense blr in  is provided by its optical spectrum .",
    "the na  i  @xmath274 emission line is rather strong ( oke & lauer 1979 ; phillips 1976 ) , which thompson ( 1991 ) and korista et al .",
    "( 1997 , their figure 3 g ) find can only be produced for @xmath10  , and a large column density ( required to shield neutral na  i from ionizing radiation at @xmath275  ev )",
    ".    has a `` red '' continuum (  3.3 ) , which is rather rare among quasars .",
    "two of the four quasars with narrow lines described by baldwin et al .",
    "1988 also have a @xmath276 uv spectral slope , but the other two narrow line quasars have @xmath277 and @xmath278 , which are typical values .",
    "it thus appears that some of the properties of , in particular the relatively weak c  iii ]  @xmath270 , and the blueshifted excess emission in the high ionization lines , may be common in narrow line quasars . a more systematic study of the uv emission of narrow line agns is required to establish their typical emission line properties , their relation to low ionization balqsos , and to eventually understand the underlying physics .",
    "a high s / n uv spectrum of  was obtained with the _ hst _ fos with a spectral resolution of @xmath279 over the 1150 - 3250    spectral region .",
    "the following main results are obtained from our analysis of the uv spectrum of .    1 .",
    "the mg  ii  @xmath0 doublet is partially resolved .",
    "the measured doublet ratio is 1.2/1 , consistent with theoretical predictions that the blr is highly optically thick to absorption in this line . 2 .",
    "the al  iii  @xmath1 doublet is clearly resolved with an `` optically thick '' doublet ratio of 1.25/1 .",
    "the line optical depth provides an upper limit to the clouds distance from the ionizing source which is consistent with the `` standard '' blr radius .",
    "the strength of this line requires a blr component with @xmath142  .",
    "a weak uv absorption system is detected in n  v , and possibly c  iv and  as well , indicating an outflow with a line of sight velocity of @xmath2  and velocity dispersion @xmath3 .",
    "lines from ions of increasing ionization level show increasing excess flux on the blue wing , and an increasing shift in the velocity of the emission line peak , reaching a maximum blueshift of @xmath4  for he  ii  @xmath5 .",
    "this may indicate an outflowing component in the blr , visible only in the approaching direction , where the ionization level increases with velocity .",
    "the highest velocity part of this outflow may produce the observed uv absorption system .",
    "the small c iii]@xmath6 ew , and the small c iii]@xmath7  and c",
    "iii]@xmath7si iii]@xmath280 flux ratios indicate that the bulk of the gas in the blr has a density of @xmath157  , about an order of magnitude larger than typically seen in agns .",
    "very weak [ c iii]@xmath11 and [ si iii]@xmath12 emission may be present , indicating there may be a nlr component with @xmath13  .",
    "the c  iii@xmath48 line is clearly detected .",
    "its strength indicates a blr component with @xmath10  .",
    "prominent fe  ii  uv  191 emission is seen , together with weaker emission lines at 1294    and 1871   .",
    "these three features have been proposed in the literature as evidence for significant  pumping of the 8 - 10 ev levels of fe  ii . 9 .",
    "significant fe  iii emission is present .",
    "fe  iii uv  34 and uv  48 multiplets are clearly resolved , and fe  iii uv  1 , uv  47 , uv  50 , and uv  68 may also be present .",
    "the implications of significant fe  iii emission for the conditions in the blr needs to be explored .",
    "the suggestion by grandi ( 1983 ) that the o  i  @xmath76 emission line is partly converted to o  i ]  @xmath91 is ruled out in the case of , indicating that the bulk of o  i  bowen flouresence occurs in the blr clouds at a depth where @xmath97 .",
    "the strong suppression of o  i  @xmath76 in  is either due to reddening , or to balmer continuum absorption .",
    "the hst spectrum of  demonstrates the richness and complexity of quasars emission line spectra .",
    "it is not clear whether some of the emission features are unique to , or whether they are typical of most agns .",
    "many of the features detected here would be blended and unidentifiable in typical quasar spectra , creating a deceptively simple emission spectrum .",
    "a close inspection of the francis et al .",
    "composite ( fig.1 ) suggests that most of the features detected here are indeed present in other agns .",
    "the rich uv emission spectrum of  should serve as a useful benchmark for photoionization codes , in particular for codes attempting to calculate the complex emission spectrum of fe  ii .",
    "many weak features remain unidentified , and it is likely that at least some of these are weak fe  ii features .",
