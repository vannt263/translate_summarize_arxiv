    "measuring the volt - ampere characteristic of superconducting cable - in - conduit conductors is one of the most important way to completely characterize their dc behavior . in order to measure the voltage drop along the conductor",
    ", voltage taps are placed on the conduit ( a ti or stainless - steel jacket ) at some distance apart in the high field region of the sample .",
    "this distance should be greater than the length of the twist pitch of the last cabling stage in order to comply with the request of complete transposition of strands .",
    "the superposition of the magnetic field produced by the transport current in the sample and the external background field @xmath0 results in a linear magnetic field gradient in the sample cross - section as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "two typical strand trajectories in a given section of the cable with a field gradient as a result of the superposition of the uniform background field with the self - field of the cable . in this configuration the field gradient points in the ox direction.,width=288 ]    on a certain line the magnetic field will vary between a minimum @xmath1 and a maximum value @xmath2 . each strand among the thousands of strands in the cable travels on a complicated spiraled path trough this field gradient and has therefore different locally defined critical currents .",
    "two typical strand trajectories are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "assuming that all strands are charged uniformly with current by a perfect joint , as soon as the strands arrive in the high field region of the cable , the condition is met that some strands will happen to carry a current higher that the local critical current imposed by the local magnetic field in the cable at this position .",
    "depending on the degree of transversal conductance between the strands , a more or less intensive current transfer process starts .",
    "if the transversal conductance is high and the length of the strand path is large , at steady state the current in each strand will be modulated following more or less the magnetic field pattern seen by the strand on its path .",
    "the measured electric field is then an average of the electric fields generated by the strands in the cable .",
    "the average electric field can be calculated by integrating the electrical field along the length of the strands .",
    "assuming that the cable is ergodic @xcite this average is equal with the cable cross - section ensemble average calculated using the strand geometrical probability distribution @xcite .",
    "this geometric averaging and some subtleties involved in their calculation is the object of the present investigation .",
    "excepting the cables made of insulated strands , in real cables there is always a certain current transfer possible . depending on the inter - strand transversal resistance ,",
    "the current transfer length @xmath3 is defined as the length needed to balance an initial current inhomogeneity . extending ( without proof ) to a full - size cable the relation proposed earlier by ekin @xcite for the filaments in a strand , we can define a current - transfer length @xmath3 by    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the cable diameter , @xmath6 is the transversal resistivity , a measure of the inter - strand contact resistance and @xmath7 is the resistivity criterion , @xmath8 defined with the help of the electric field criterion @xmath9 and the critical current density @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the power - law index from the nonlinear current - voltage characteristic of the superconducting strands    @xmath12    the strand position in the cable cross - section @xmath13 can be described with a very good accuracy by the following equations :    @xmath14    where : @xmath15 is the axial coordinate along the cable axis , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the radius and the twist - pitch of the @xmath18-th stage and @xmath19 the number of stages .",
    "the index @xmath20 and the phases @xmath21 are introduce to describe different strands with different initial positions .",
    "@xmath22 is the number of strands in the cable .",
    "we adopt here the convention that the twist - pitch increases with the @xmath18 index , the smallest being @xmath23 and the greatest @xmath24 .",
    "if we follow and record the position of one strand at enough many slices at coordinate @xmath25 , an integer multiple of the last twist - pitch length , we will see that these recorded positions cover almost uniformly the cross - section of the cable .",
    "moreover , if we look at all strands position in one slice we will see a similar uniform distribution . from a statistical point of view",
    "we can not distinguish between the two pictures . in this case",
    "we say that the cable is ergodic and we can replace the average over the length of one strand by an average over all strands in one slice . stated in a more simple way , the average over the length @xmath26 of any physical cable property @xmath27 can be replaced by a cross - section average with a suitable probability distribution function @xmath28    @xmath29    with @xmath30 the coordinate along the cable length and @xmath31 is the average of @xmath27 .",
    "the fact that the cable cross - section is circular and is covered by a magnetic field distribution in the form of a linear gradient as shown in fig.[fig1 ] forces us to calculate the probability distribution function of the strands having coordinate between @xmath32 and @xmath33 but an arbitrary value of @xmath34 .",
    "all this strands feel the same magnetic field .",
    "this new distribution function can be calculated with the relation    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the number of strands having coordinate between @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath22 the total number of strands in the cable .",
    "if the strands are uniformly distributed in the cable cross - section with a density @xmath37 , @xmath36 and @xmath22 are proportional to the area of the stripe of width @xmath38 ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , @xmath39 and the total cross - section area of the cable , @xmath40 .",
    "after substitution in eq.[prob ] one obtains    @xmath41    if the twist pitch length of the last stage @xmath42 is long , the strands on the high field region of the cross - section field gradient will have a local critical current which is lower than the carried current and the strands on the low field region of the gradient , a critical current higher than the own current .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig2]a .",
    "effect of magnetic field gradient in the cable cross - section on the critical current of strands .",
    ", width=336 ]    in this case the averages can be calculated with a different probability function , p(b ) which can be calculated with the help of the probability distribution @xmath43 .",
    "let us represent the magnetic field distribution in the cable as    @xmath44    where @xmath0 is the background magnetic field and @xmath18 a proportionality constant .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we treat now @xmath32 as a random variable defined on the interval @xmath47 $ ] with the distribution @xmath43 given by eq.[pxfinal ] . by virtue of eq.[field ] , b(x ) is also a random variable .",
    "let us calculate now the probability distribution function of @xmath48 , a function of the random variable @xmath32 with probability distribution function @xmath43 .",
    "we start with the standard definition of a probability distribution of a random variable which is a function of another random variable with known distribution    @xmath49    the integral in eq.[newdistr ] can be calculated with the help of the following known relation in the theory of @xmath50-distribution function    @xmath51    where @xmath52 are the roots of the equation @xmath53 . in our case , @xmath54 , has a single root @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "substituting this in eq.[newdistr ] we obtain    @xmath57    this function is the probability distribution of the field @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "if we perform a change of variable @xmath59 , the probability distribution function can be written as    @xmath60    where now the variable @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "let us apply this relation to the calculation of the average critical current in a cable . from eqs.[ergodic ] and [ pxfinal ] we have    @xmath62",
    "if the twist pitch is shorter than the current - transfer length , the current - carrying capacity of the strand will be determined by the critical current at the most highly field in the cable cross - section .",
    "the strand who crosses the @xmath2 position at @xmath63 will keep its current @xmath64 all over the way down from that section and will create a circular region of constant current @xmath65 .",
    "the same is true for all other strands who pass a region with a field intensity @xmath66 thus creating circular regions of constant current @xmath67 as shown in fig.[fig2]b .",
    "the linear field gradient on the cable cross - section , created by the overlapping of the self and background fields , is replaced by a circular current distribution .",
    "applying eq.[prob ] to this case and observing that @xmath68 and @xmath69 we obtain the distribution function for this case    @xmath70    where @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the probability distribution of the field can be calculated similar with the calculation performed before for the long twist pitch case .",
    "we have    @xmath72    with @xmath73 in the range @xmath74 $ ] . if we change the field variable @xmath75 and observe that @xmath76 we can write the probability distribution as    @xmath77    where @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "the average of critical current calculated with this distribution is    @xmath79    and applies if the last twist pitch of the cable is shorter than the current - transfer length .",
    "the average calculated with the geometrical probability distribution function does not take into account the fact that not all strands cut the cable section at the same angle . a longitudinal cut trough",
    "a cable reveals this problem . as shown in fig.[fig3 ] , the cut - off cross - section of strands close to the cable center is very large ( elongated ellipses ) indicating that these strands are almost parallel with the cable axis . moving away from cable axis in the radial direction , the cross - section area of the strand - cuts decrease reaching a minimum ( almost circular ) at the cable edge , where the strands are almost perpendicular to the cable axis .     a longitudinal cut in a cable in conduit conductor .",
    "the cross - section of the cut in the strands is decreasing radially from center to the edge.,width=288 ]    therefore , besides the uniform distribution of strand position in the cable cross - section which leads to the geometrical probability distribution @xmath43 of eq.[pxfinal ] , we have also a radial distribution of strand angles relative to the cable axis . both distribution overlap ,",
    "coexist and are interrelated .",
    "the cable phase - space is therefore not restricted to the set of points @xmath80 .",
    "it should be extended to the set @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the tangent of the angles the strand makes with the @xmath86 and @xmath87 axis .",
    "@xmath88    in this section a new average formula will be developed which accounts for this extension .",
    "usually , one calculates the average electric field by considering a geometry as in fig.[fig1 ] where the vertical stripe of width @xmath38 includes all strands sensing the same local magnetic field @xmath48 .",
    "the strand cut - angle has a radial distribution as illustrated in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the angular average is calculated using a set of concentric rings of width @xmath89 containing strands having the same cut - angle @xmath90 as shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the variation of the cut - angle with the radius is encoded in the @xmath91 dependence of @xmath92 , a smooth convex function . in order to calculate the probability distribution function",
    ", we make a change of variable from initial variables @xmath93 to the variables @xmath94 .",
    "the transformation is     the distribution of strand cut - angles in a typical cable in conduit conductor.,width=326 ]    @xmath95    the jacobian of this coordinate transformation is    @xmath96    the average electric field @xmath97 is calculated with the basic relation    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the cross - section area of the cable .",
    "if we use the jacobian , eq.[eq5 ] we get    @xmath100    where we have taken into account that only the normal component of the current density @xmath101 contributes to the axial electric field . separating the variables one finally obtains    @xmath102^n \\int_x^{r_c}dr \\dfrac{r\\cos^n(\\theta ( r))}{\\sqrt{r^2-x^2}}\\ ] ]    this formula has a very simple structure . the average electric field is first the `` sum '' of local electric fields in the cable cross - section of constant field times a weighting factor @xmath43 which is contained in the second ( the @xmath92-integral ) .",
    "the limiting case is when all strands are parallel to the cable axis .",
    "then , @xmath103 for all @xmath104 $ ] and we get    @xmath105    which is the well known geometric probability distribution function @xcite for a simply connected cable with circular cross - section .    in other words",
    "we can keep the standard formula for the average electric field    @xmath106    but with a modified weight or probability distribution function    @xmath107    unfortunately , the integral in eq.[eq11 ] has no analytical solution in terms of simple functions .",
    "it is remarkable that the angular distribution keeps track of the power - law index @xmath11 . in @xcite",
    "it was inferred , based on unpublished numerical simulation that @xmath108 as a function of @xmath92 is given by    @xmath109    where @xmath110 .",
    "it can be seen that this dependence satisfies the condition that the strand angle is small close to the cable axis and large at the cable edge .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper show that there are two limiting cases concerning the current transfer in cable in conduit conductors which influence the average procedure which must be performed when calculating different cable properties .",
    "let us follow the strand position as it meanders in the cable cross - section starting from a position at or very close to the @xmath1 position .",
    "the initial current in the strand is @xmath111 . as the strand is moving in regions with higher field @xmath112 where @xmath113 some current transfer ought to take place to neighboring strands . if the transversal inter - strand resistance is negligible small , the excess current , @xmath114 is easily transfered and the current in the strand follows nearly the variation of @xmath115 in the cable cross - section .",
    "the consequence is that the cable cross - section is divided in vertical stripes where the field and the current in the strands are constant and the average is calculated with the distribution function from eq.[pxfinal ] .",
    "if the transversal resistance is very large , the surplus current can not be transfered and strands with an excess current will penetrate in the high field region of the cable . in this case",
    "the cable cross - section is divided in circular regions where the local magnetic field varies linearly between @xmath0 at the center and @xmath2 on the cable boundary .",
    "the average is calculated with a different distribution function eq.[pb2new ] .",
    "the boundary value of the transversal resistivity , @xmath116 between the two regimes can be set by comparing the current - transfer length , eq.[eq2 ] with the length of the last twist pitch of the cable @xmath117    @xmath118    solving for @xmath116 one gets    @xmath119    as can be seen , if the inter - strand transversal resistivity @xmath120 , the current redistribution is very effective .",
    "the limit value is proportional to @xmath11 the power -law index of the strands , increases with the square of the last twist pitch length and is inverse - proportional to the square of the cable diameter .",
    "cables with large @xmath11 , long last - stage twist - pitch length @xmath117 and small diameter @xmath5 have large @xmath116 values and better tolerance to higher transverse inter - strand contact resistance .    in both cases formulas for the calculation of the probability distribution function for the magnetic field",
    "are also presented .",
    "a second issue treated in this paper is connected with the fact that the strands in a cable - in - conduit conductor do not cut the cable cross - section at right angles nor at any other constant angle .",
    "the cut angle is rather distributed , increasing monotonically from a small value for strands near the center of the cable to almost 90@xmath121 at the cable border .",
    "the strand is therefore characterized not only by the position coordinates @xmath122 and @xmath123 in the cable cross section but also by the angle it has with a given transversal cut through the cable .",
    "the cable phase - space must be extended to the set @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the new distribution function , taking into account this effect is given in eq.[eq11 ] .",
    "the statistical mechanical approach sketched in this paper , based on the concept of viewing the strands as particles in movement could be very useful for the complete understanding of the complicated thermal and electromagnetic properties of cable - in - conduit conductors with twisted strands and multi - stage structure .",
    "we used here only one concept borrowed from statistical mechanics , the concept of ergodicity which allows one to replace the average over the length by an average over the cable cross - section .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the memory of dr .",
