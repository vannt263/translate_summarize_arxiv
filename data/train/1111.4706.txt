    "recent experimental work with ultracold molecules has generated a revolution in molecular physics @xcite .",

    "an emerging direction in this field aims to extend the cooling techniques and study of ultracold diatomic molecules to large polyatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "cooling complex polyatomic molecules to cold and ultracold temperatures , if possible , will open up exciting opportunities for studying novel phenomena in physics and chemistry .",
    "for example , kpper _ et al _ have recently demonstrated how to manipulate the motion of polyatomic molecules in molecular beams using external fields @xcite .",
    "this may lead to the development of new experiments on precision measurements of large molecule collisions .",
    "one can also use intense laser fields @xcite or static electric fields @xcite to align cold molecules along a certain axis in the laboratory frame , which may provide a diversity of applications in molecular optics @xcite , controlled chemistry @xcite , and spectroscopic analysis @xcite .",
    "cooling ensembles of polyatomic molecules is also necessary for the research of cold chemistry @xcite .    among all cooling techniques ,",
    "buffer - gas cooling is the most powerful and versatile method that produces molecules in translationally and internally cold states @xcite .",
    "this technique relies on energy thermalization of molecules in a buffer gas ( e.g. , helium ) maintained at a cold temperature . until recently",
    ", it was expected that polyatomic molecules , when placed in a cold buffer gas , will collect buffer gas atoms into clusters , which should make cooling polyatomic molecules difficult .",
    "however , patterson _",
    "et al _ have recently measured the thermalization rates of naphthalene ( n ) molecules in a cold helium gas @xcite .",
    "contrary to the expectation , they observed no clustering .",
    "they proposed an explanation based on the lindemann mechanism @xcite .",
    "their model suggests that if the energy of the first excited vibrational state of the molecule is higher than the molecule - helium binding energy , there should be no clustering observed .",
    "however , this model excludes the role of rotational degrees of freedom in cold collisions .",
    "could the rotation induce a collision complex and thus trapping - clustering via a lindemann mechanism ?    here",
    "we undertake a detailed study of the collision dynamics between helium and two kinds of molecules , naphthalene and benzene , under conditions close to buffer - gas cooling experiments . at temperatures below 10  k ,",
    "these molecules reside in the ground vibrational state .",
    "we therefore treat the molecules as rigid .",
    "the rigid approximation can be justified semiclassically by noting that the vibrational modes in question are really ground state wavepackets represented by a mean position at rest .",
    "the conventional classical trajectory calculations for high energy dynamics allow all atoms in a molecule to move .",
    "these calculations , however , prove to be difficult to preserve the rigidity of molecules and are hard to implement for low temperature collisions excluding vibrational transitions .",
    "in addition , these methods meet with the zero point energy problem that may lead to unphysical energy localization in particular vibrational modes . here",
    ", we adapt a molecular dynamics theory used in the simulation of polyatomic fluids to study low temperature collisions @xcite . in our approach ,",
    "the number of differential equations to solve is independent of the number of atoms in the molecule .",
    "only the center - of - mass of molecules participates in the equations of the relative motion in a space - fixed ( sf ) frame .",
    "the rotational motion of the molecules is described separately by quaternion parameters in a body - fixed ( bf ) frame .",
    "we maintain the shape of the molecules by converting the coordinates of atoms in the molecules from the bf frame to the sf frame by a rotation matrix constructed using the quaternion parameters .",
    "the rigidity of the molecules is therefore preserved without introducing internal coordinates to constrain the bond length and angles of the molecules .",
    "low energy collisions have been an interesting research topic for a long time @xcite .",
    "however , classical trajectory studies of collisions involving rigid molecules are restricted to small and symmetric - top molecules .",
    "this paper provides the first classical study of collision dynamics between a large rigid asymmetric - top molecule and an atom .",
    "the method introduced here can also find many other applications .",
    "we carry out classical trajectory calculations for naphthalene - helium and benzene - helium collisions at a temperature @xmath0  k. in this section , we illustrate the methodology by naphthalene molecules .",
    "naphthalene is a complex asymmetric - top molecule which has a large number of degrees of freedom . as shown in figure .",
    "[ e - levels ] , there are over one hundred non - degenerate rotational energy levels below 7  @xmath1 .",
    "the complexity of the naphthalene molecules precludes the fully quantum calculation of the he - naphthalene collision dynamics . at low temperatures relevant for the buffer - gas cooling experiments , however , particles may behave classically .",
    "the thermal de broglie wavelength of helium at the temperature of 6.5  k is about 3.56   .",
    "the mean interatomic distance in the buffer gas is around 136   .",
    "this indicates that quantum effects in the collision dynamics are insignificant @xcite .",
    "moreover , a typical classical action associated to energy transfer between helium and naphthalene at this temperature is on the order of 10  @xmath1 .",
    "it is much larger than the rotational energy splitting of naphthalene , as shown in fig .",
