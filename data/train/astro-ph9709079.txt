    "it has long been recognized that the knowledge of the thermochemical equilibrium and stability of plasmas is a crucial point for understanding the origin of astrophysical structures at very different scales ( field 1965 ) .",
    "in fact , the onset of thermal ( or more generally thermochemical ) instabilities can directly induce the formation of inhomogeneities or can set in physical conditions appropriated for developing other kind of instabilities , say for instance , the gravitational one . as a direct agent in forming condensations",
    "it has been considered in studies of the solar atmosphere ( priest 1987 ; reale , serio & peres 1994 ) , the interstellar medium ( field goldsmith , habing & field 1969 ; hunter 1970 ; mckee & ostriker 1977 ; flannery and press 1979 ; cowie , mckee & ostriker 1981 ; ) , gas at high latitude and in outer disks of galaxies ( verschuur & magnani 1994 , ferrara & field 1994 ) , ly@xmath2 clouds ( sargent et al . 1980 ; black 1981 ; bond , szalay & silk 1988 ; baron et al . 1989 ; murakami & ikeuchi 1990 ; pettini et al . 1990",

    "on the other hand , the generalization of field s ( 1965 ) basic study on thermal instability for including effects of chemical reactions has been carried out by goldsmith ( 1970 ) , defouw ( 1970 ) , yoneyama ( 1973 ) , flannery and press 1979 ; ibaez & parravano ( 1983 ) ; ibaez & mendoza ( 1990 ) , and corbelli and ferrara ( 1995 ) . however , in these works it has not been taken into account the fact that when the temperature , density and the other thermodynamical quantities change , the position of the chemical equilibrium also varies , i.e. in a reacting gas the fluctuations occur on states out of thermodynamic equilibrium because , generally , the chemical relaxation time is not short enough to follow the change of pressure and density .",
    "so , if the restoring of the chemical equilibrium after an initial compression , for instance , occurs relatively slowly , it can not follow the compression . but the irreversible tendency of the concentrations to reach the equilibrium values corresponding to the new value of pressure and density produces an increase of entropy with the corresponding energy dissipation .",
    "( landau and lifshitz 1987 ) . the present work is aimed at considering such effects in a general reacting gas .",
    "additionally , two particular applications will be carried out : ( 1 ) to the pure hydrogen plasma model worked out by ibaez & parravano ( 1983 ) , and ( 2 ) to the photoionized plasma with metallicity @xmath1 studied by corbelli and ferrara 1995 , hereinafter references ip and cf , respectively .",
    "for a fluid where a chemical reaction of the form @xmath3 is proceeding , the equations of gas dynamics can be written in the form @xmath4",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the convective derivative and the remaining symbols are defined in table 1 .    for reacting fluids",

    "the chemical equilibrium is defined by the condition @xmath16 therefore , the chemical equilibrium value of @xmath17 ( denoted by @xmath18 ) becomes a function of the density and the temperature which generally are functions of time , i.e. @xmath19 $ ] .    on the other hand , and",
    "as it is well known , in an hypothetical infinite medium , equations ( 1)-(5 ) admit a steady state ( uniform ) solution corresponding to a complete thermodynamical equilibrium , i.e. @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfying the equation    @xmath23    equation ( 10 ) defines the thermal equilibrium .",
    "the stability of the above equilibria is usually analyzed ( in the linear approximation ) looking for solutions of equations ( 1)-(5 ) in the form of plane waves , superimposed to the equilibrium values i.e.    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the @xmath26 value at equilibrium and @xmath27 is the respective time dependence of the disturbance on the variable @xmath26 . substituting equation ( 11 ) in equations ( 1)-(5 ) and neglecting nonlinear terms in @xmath28 one obtains the set of linearized equations @xmath29",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 hereinafter , the subindex @xmath34 denoting equilibrium values will be dropped .",
    "the linearized equation ( 14 ) takes into account the fact that when @xmath21 and @xmath22 change , the position of the equilibrium @xmath35 also varies ( landau and lifshitz 1987 ; zeldovich and raizer 1966 ) . for a detailed analysis of this basic aspect of the problem ,",
    "see vincenti and kruger ( 1975 ) .    as usually ,",
    "one may proceed further looking for solutions of the dynamical variables @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 however , from equation ( 14 ) follows that a solution for @xmath39 exists if and only if the amplitude of the disturbances @xmath40 , @xmath41and @xmath42are related by the equation @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the amplitude of the density and temperature fluctuation , respectively . therefore , equations ( 12)-(16 ) are reduced to two algebraic equations for @xmath41 and @xmath46 i. e.    @xmath47\\rho _ 1+[(\\mathcal{n}\\tau + 1)p_tk^2+\\xi _ { *",

    "note that the way of considering the disturbance in the chemical parameter @xmath17 in eqs.(14 ) and ( 17 ) is different from that of the above papers .",
    "in fact , in those papers the hypothetical initial  equilibrium state  is considered _ frozen _ , as that in absence of relaxing processes and the chemical fluctuation is assumed to follow that of pressure , density and velocity .",
    "however , this is only an acceptable first approximation . in deed",
    ", once the initial equilibrium is disturbed , an irreversible process set in and the chemical evolution tends to a _ new equilibrium _ corresponding to the _ new values _ of pressure and density .",
    "therefore , it is not matter how tiny this effect is , it changes qualitatively the problem .",
    "the effect of finite value of the relaxation time is equivalent to think on a__second viscosity _ _ ( landau & lifshitz 1987 ) and this is the last physical reason by which fluctuations with large wave numbers can be damped in a fluid where no other irreversible process , except the chemical reaction , goes into play .",
    "this aspect of the problem will be again considered later on .",
    "equation ( 17 ) gives the correct amplitude for the chemical parameter in both asymptotic limits : no reacting gases , i.e. when @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and in _ equilibrium flow _ for which @xmath58 and @xmath59 , i.e. when the chemical reaction is so fast that it instantaneously adjusts to the chemical equilibrium values and therefore , the changes of density and temperature occur in chemical equilibrium .",
    "note that in the equilibrium flow limit , @xmath60 , @xmath61 but @xmath62 , contrary to the simple _ equilibrium _ ( as in a closed system with fixed conditions ) for which @xmath60 and @xmath63 , case considered in the mentioned references at the end of the previous section . in practice however , and from the physical point of view , the above asymptotic limits correspond , respectively , to the case when the chemical time scale is much longer , ( @xmath64__n__@xmath65 ) and much more shorter ( @xmath66__n__@xmath67 ) , than the characteristic time of the density and temperature fluctuation .    on the other hand , as it can be readily verified , when @xmath68 , the dispersion relation ( 20 ) reduces to the corresponding field ( 1965 ) equation , and when @xmath69 , equation ( 20 ) reduces to @xmath70 where @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 stands as in equation ( 21 ) .",
    "by applying the hurwitz criteria to the equation ( 22 ) one obtains that an instability sets in when any of the following relations is fulfilled , @xmath74 @xmath75\\leq 0~ ,   \\label{25}\\ ] ] @xmath76 note that in absence of thermal conduction the above criteria become independent of the wave number @xmath77 .",
    "criterion ( 24 ) is parker s ( 1953 ) isochoric criterion of thermal instability but modified by the presence of the chemical reaction , i.e. the change with time of temperature occurs in chemical equilibrium .",
    "criterion ( 25 ) can be identified as field s ( 1965 ) isentropic criterion for thermal instability also modified by the chemical reaction .",
    "in fact , as can be readily verified , if the equilibrium value @xmath78 is weekly dependent on density and temperature , the relation ( 25 ) reduces to the corresponding field s isentropic criterion . in the opposite case when the dependence of the heating / cooling function on @xmath21 and @xmath22 is very week ( @xmath79 )",
    ", the criterion stands barely due to internal processes ( the chemical reaction  ) , i.e. @xmath80\\leq 0~.   \\label{27}\\ ] ] if @xmath81 , the criterion simplifies further , that is , isentropic instability sets in when the expression in square brackets in relation ( 27 ) is less that zero . if the above occurs when @xmath82 and @xmath83 , sound waves with wave number smaller than the critical number @xmath84defined by the equality in ( 27 ) are amplified and those larger ones are damped , but if @xmath85 and @xmath86 sound waves are amplified regardless of the wave length . on the contrary , if the expression in square brackets in ( 27 ) is positive , the sounds waves are damped .",
    "relations ( 26 ) can be identified as field s ( 1965 ) isobaric criteria for thermal instability , modified by the chemical reaction . as in the previous case ,",
    "the respective thermal instability would proceed in chemical equilibrium .",
    "generally , from the above modified criterion it follows that very fast chemical reactions may help to develop or may quench the respective isobaric thermal instability depending on the signs of @xmath87 and @xmath88 terms for the particular reaction under consideration .",
    "in particular , if @xmath89 , this criterion can be written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 note that if the chemical parameter in chemical equilibrium @xmath35 weekly depends on density and temperature , i.e. @xmath92 , the above criterion reduces to the isobaric field s criterion for nonreacting gases .",
    "however , the above generalized criterion , relation ( 28 ) , provides further information . in effect , in the opposite case , that is , when the heating / cooling function @xmath93 weekly depends on @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath94 , criterion ( 28 ) simplifies to @xmath95 which can be identified as an isobaric instability criterion due only to the chemical reaction .    other important conclusion drawn from the instability criteria ( 24)-(26 )",
    "is concerned with the critical wave numbers @xmath96 defined by the respective equality which corresponds to the marginal states .",
    "it is obvious that very fast chemical reactions may produce drastic changes in the critical scale lengths at which any thermal instability may occur . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath97 , and @xmath98 but this last term is not large enough for quenching the isochoric instability , the critical wave number @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) can be considerable increased respect to the critical wave number in a non - reacting gas .",
    "similar considerations can be made for the remaining two critical wave numbers , the isentropic and the isobaric ones , as it will be seen bellow where particular applications will be considered .",
    "on the other hand , for fluctuations with wave number @xmath101 , equation ( 20 ) becomes @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104stand as in equation ( 21 ) , but @xmath71 and @xmath105 reduce to @xmath106 if in addition @xmath61 , the dispersion relation ( 31 ) further reduces to @xmath107 i.e. there is only one ( thermoreactive ) mode with rate @xmath108 , which becomes unstable if @xmath109 , provided that @xmath110 .    for the opposite asymptotic case ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath111 , the dispersion equation ( 20 ) simplifies to @xmath112 therefore , there are two modes with rates @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "obviously , for chemically stable reactions the last mode can be unstable provided that @xmath115 , otherwise any fluctuation with very short wave length is damped in a chemical time scale .      in the general case , when the time scale @xmath14 is @xmath116 , case usually found in practical problems , applying the hurwitz criteria to the fifth order polynomial ( 20 ) , five instability criteria are found .",

    "the above criterion reduces to the isochoric criterion for nonreacting fluids when @xmath122 . on the other hand , for fluctuations with @xmath101",

    "fifth instability criterion is just @xmath127 , and coincides with the isobaric modified criterion ( 28 ) .",
    "therefore , the above criterion is independent of the chemical time scale @xmath14 and it stands as far as @xmath128 , i.e. when chemical reactions proceed in the fluid under consideration .",

    "> from the above , one may conclude that the effect of taking into account the change of the ionization equilibrium position due to the variation of density and temperature , is to stabilize the oscillating modes , at least for high enough values of the wave number , as it should be expected from landau s results on second viscosity . however , the quantitative stabilizing effect depends on the particular values of photon energy , metallicity and plasma temperature .",
    "for instance , for the values used in figures 3c-3d and 5c-5d , such an effect is able to stabilize the unstable acoustic mode in the whole range of @xmath77 under consideration .",
    "but , for those used in fig4c-4d the effect is only capable of stabilizing acoustic oscillations with @xmath229 .",
    "in summary , if one takes into account the effects of a finite chemical relaxation time in optically thin reacting plasmas a fifth order dispersion equation is obtained , instead of the fourth order polynomial obtained when such effects are neglected .",
    "the quantitative effects on the previous four modes depend on the particular reacting plasma under consideration , but generally , it tends to further stabilize the plasma and to increase the damping of stable modes because of the second viscosity generated by the chemical reaction .    in the collisionally ionized pure hydrogen plasma model previously studied by",
    "ip the resulting effects are not too strong .",
    "in addition to the appearance of the new damped real mode , only an increase in the value of both the damping and growing rates occur .",
    "however , in the photoionized plasma studied by cf , the effects may result more severe , depending on the exact value of the parameters under consideration .",
    "in particular , the range of temperature where the plasma is unstable can be strongly reduced , and the oscillatory instability can be quenched for @xmath77 large enough .",
    "so for instance , for values likely occurring in the galactic halo , the present analysis leaves a very restrict values of @xmath77 for developing instability .",
