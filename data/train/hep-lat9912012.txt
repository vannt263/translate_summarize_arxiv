    "topology plays an essential role in determining the low energy features of strong interaction physics . in this paper",
    "we present a lattice study of the topological properties of qcd in presence of four flavours of degenerate dynamical staggered fermions .",
    "a relevant quantity is the topological susceptibility , defined in the continuum as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the chern current and @xmath2 is the topological charge density , @xmath3 eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) defines the prescription for the singularity of the time ordered product when @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath5 in the quenched theory is related to the @xmath6 mass by the witten - veneziano formula .",
    "it has been successfully measured on the lattice  @xcite , confirming the witten - veneziano prediction .    in full qcd with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking",
    ", @xmath5 is related to the quark condensate  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the quark mass and @xmath9 the number of flavours .",
    "we want to test eq .",
    "( 3 ) for @xmath10 and different values of @xmath8 .",
    "another relevant quantity is the slope at @xmath11 of the topological susceptibility , @xmath12 , defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 . in the quenched theory the consistency of the witten - veneziano mechanism requires @xmath15 to be small . instead in full qcd it is expected to be larger and related to the singlet axial charge ( and so to the proton spin crisis )  @xcite .",
    "therefore its determination is of particular importance .",
    "unfortunately , techniques which work well for the lattice determination of @xmath5 , are not straightforwardly applicable to the measurement of @xmath15",
    ". we will present a preliminary estimate of @xmath15 and discuss perspectives for future refinements .",
    "we have simulated the full theory using the hmc algorithm with 4 flavours of staggered fermions at @xmath16 and four different values of the bare quark mass , @xmath17 , performing for each mass value respectively 6000,1500,1000 and 3000 units of molecular dynamics time .",
    "we have used a @xmath18 lattice and the wilson action for the pure gauge sector .",
    "0.3 cm    the field theoretical method has been used to determine @xmath5 . given a discretization @xmath19 of the topological charge density",
    ", we define the lattice susceptibility : @xmath20 @xmath21 is related by a finite multiplicative renormalization @xmath22 to the continuum topological charge with fermionic operators appears , which anyway can be shown to be negligible  @xcite . ] .",
    "moreover @xmath23 in general does not meet the continuum prescription used in eq .",
    "( 1 ) and , due to contact terms in the product @xmath24 at small @xmath25 , a further additive renormalization appears @xmath26 the heating method  @xcite has been used to evaluate the renormalizations .",
    "@xmath22 is determined by measuring @xmath27 on a sample of thermalized configurations obtained by heating a semiclassical one - instanton configuration .",
    "similarly @xmath28 is obtained by measuring @xmath23 on a sample with zero topological background , using the fact that eq .",
    "( 1 ) leads to @xmath29 in the trivial topological sector .",
    "smearing techniques have been used to improve the operator @xmath21  @xcite , in order to reduce the renormalizations and obtain a better accuracy on @xmath5 after subtraction .",
    "we have performed 2 smearing steps , starting from a standard discretization of @xmath30 , with a smearing coefficient @xmath31 , as reported in  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we report the results obtained for @xmath32 versus the quark mass .",
    "the clear dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath8 disappears when going to physical units .",
    "we have fixed the scale by measuring the string tension , obtaining @xmath33 at @xmath34 and @xmath35 at @xmath36 . from these values , assuming @xmath37 , we obtain @xmath38 and @xmath39 , from which @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we can not rule out possible systematic errors coming both from the poor sampling of topological modes at the lowest quark masses  @xcite and from the determination of the physical scale .",
    "indeed at @xmath36 we have determined the lattice spacing also by measuring @xmath42 and @xmath43 , obtaining a different result , @xmath44 . using this value we obtain @xmath45 , which is closer to the theoretical expectation coming from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath46 .",
    "on the lattice we can define @xmath47 a relation similar to eq .",
    "( 6 ) holds in this case  @xcite : @xmath48 while @xmath22 in the previous equation is the same appearing in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , since it is purely related to the renormalization of the topological charge , @xmath49 is a new additive renormalization , containing mixings of @xmath50 to operators of equal or lower dimension . more generally , defining the two - point correlation function of the topological charge density on the lattice , @xmath51 , one can write @xmath52 @xmath53 indicates mixings with terms of equal or lower dimension in the wilson ope of @xmath51 , and is related to @xmath28 and @xmath49 in the following way : @xmath54      @xmath49 can not be determined by the heating method , since in this case the continuum @xmath15 is not constrained to be zero in the trivial topological sector .",
    "therefore the techniques used for @xmath5 can not be straightforwardly applied to the determination of @xmath15 . in principle @xmath49",
    "can also be computed by lattice perturbation theory , but in practice this approach is not particularly successful , especially when dealing with smeared operators for which the convergence properties of the perturbation series worsen .",
    "we stress that also cooling techniques , which can usually be used to determine @xmath5 , fail in the determination of @xmath15 : only the zero - moment of the two - point function @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath5 , is topologically protected , since it can be expressed in terms of the global topological charge , @xmath56 , and @xmath30 is quasi - stable under cooling .",
    "this is not the case for higher moments , and in particular for @xmath15 .",
    "one possibility is to use an improved topological charge operator for which @xmath49 , even if not computable , is known to be small and thus negligible in eq .",
    "if we follow this ansatz for the 2-smeared operator used previously we obtain , from our simulation at @xmath36 , @xmath57 , in good agreement with the value expected from sum rules  @xcite , @xmath58 .",
    "however , the systematic error deriving from neglecting @xmath49 , @xmath59 , can be estimated to be of the same order of magnitude as @xmath60 at @xmath36 , that is still quite large .",
    "a better estimate of @xmath15 requires deeper knowledge of the two - point correlation function . in the continuum @xmath55",
    "is known to be negative , by reflection positivity , for @xmath61 , and positive and singular for @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , when using a lattice action which preserves reflection positivity , we expect @xmath63 whenever the two operators @xmath64 and @xmath19 do not overlap .",
    "this is clear in fig .",
    "2 , where a determination at @xmath36 of @xmath65 averaged over spherical shells of width @xmath66 is reported for 1 and 2 smearings .",
    "the information on @xmath65 is not enough to extract @xmath55 : according to eq .",
    "( 9 ) , also @xmath53 is needed .",
    "however we know that @xmath53 comes from contact terms , so it must be zero at large @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , for a given operator @xmath19 , there must be an @xmath68 such that , for @xmath69 , @xmath53 can be ignored in eq .",
    "( 9 ) and @xmath55 can be easily extracted , the value of @xmath22 being known from the determination of @xmath5 .",
    "a practical way to extract @xmath68 is the following : @xmath65 is determined for two operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 and one looks for a plateau at large @xmath67 in the ratio of the two functions , corresponding to the squared ratio of the multiplicative renormalizations , @xmath72 . in this way we have determined @xmath73 for 1 and 2 smearing steps at large @xmath67 and @xmath36 , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . there is good agreement between the two determinations , as expected .",
    "work is in progress to extrapolate the information at large @xmath67 to smaller distances , thus allowing a more careful determination of @xmath15 .    9 e.witten , nucl .",
