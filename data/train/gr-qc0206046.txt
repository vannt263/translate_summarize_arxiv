    "phase transitions in the early universe are caused by the symmetry breaking leading to a manifold of degenerate vacua with nontrivial topology and giving rise to topological defects .",
    "the defects are classified by the topology of the vacua such into domain walls , cosmic strings and monopoles . if the gauge field is involved in the spontaneous symmetry breaking , the defects are gauged . on the other hand , when the symmetry is global , the emerging defects are called global defects .    in this paper , we shed light on global monopoles .",
    "although energy of the gauge monopoles is finite , the global monopoles have divergent energy because of the long tail of the field .",
    "this divergence has to be removed by cutting off at a certain distance .",
    "this procedure is not necessarily artificial , because another defect which may exist near the original one cancels the divergence .",
    "this secondary defect is not only the monopole , but also can be a domain wall or a cosmic string .",
    "global monopoles have been an interesting subject in cosmology .",
    "they were thought as of the seeds of structure formation or inflation . by taking into account the self - gravity of the global monopoles",
    ", it can give rise to a deficit solid angle@xcite , which would affect cosmological data .",
    "it , however , may be counteracted when the universe has a cosmological constant .",
    "vilenkin and linde independently pointed out that topological defects can cause inflation @xcite .",
    "when the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is larger than a certain critical value , the scalar field stays on the top of the potential after global symmetry breaking . in this case , the space would expand exponentially with time .",
    "this inflation model is called topological inflation .",
    "topological inflation does not suffer from the initial value problem , unlike the new or hybrid inflation .",
    "sakai et al .",
    "@xcite found the critical vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is @xmath7 numerically .",
    "recently new types of the self - gravitating global monopole solutions were discovered numerically@xcite .",
    "as the vev of the @xmath0 scalar field @xmath1 increases , the deficit solid angle also gets large and it becomes @xmath8 when @xmath9 . beyond this critical value",
    "there is no ordinary monopole solution , but there appears a new type of solution in the parameter range @xmath10 .",
    "this has a cosmological horizon at @xmath11 and gives a natural cutoff scale .",
    "the appearance of the new solution is similar to the supermassive string solution@xcite , which has a deficit angle larger than @xmath12 . in this sense",
    ", we will call this solution the supermassive global monopole in contrast to the ordinary global monopole .    from gravitational theoretical interest ,",
    "the black hole counterpart of the global monopole is also discussed .",
    "maison investigated the scalar hair of the black holes in the same system and showed their existence domains as a function of the radius of the event horizon@xcite .",
    "nucamendi and sudarsky discussed the definition of the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass in spacetime with deficit solid angle and found that it becomes negative for small black holes@xcite .",
    "one of the most important issues of these kinds of isolated objects is stability . in the ordinary monopole case without gravity ,",
    "if derrick s no - go theorem@xcite could be applied , they would be unstable towards radial rescaling of the field configuration .",
    "this is , however , not the case due to the diverging energy of the solutions .",
    "it was demonstrated that the ordinary monopole solutions are stable against spherical perturbations . as for the non - spherical perturbations",
    ", there was some debate .",
    "goldhaber@xcite investigated the polar perturbations and found that the energy functional is the same form as that of the sine - gordon equation under some conditions .",
    "hence there would be a zero mode leading a north - pointing teardrop shape for the monopole mass density and the knot would be untied .",
    "rhie and bennett@xcite , however , pointed out that such instability is just the artificial fixing of the monopole core .",
    "if the monopole is free to move , which is the natural situation of the isolated system , the monopole can not become a teardrop shape and is stable .",
    "this was actually confirmed by numerical simulations@xcite .",
    "bennett and rhie@xcite also pointed out by numerical calculation with 2d code that a monopole and antimonopole pair would collapse to a string through the unwinding process when these cores are artificiality fixed .",
    "if these cores of the pair are free to move , such an unwinding process does not occur .",
    "it is expected that the self - gravitating global monopoles with @xmath13 ( i.e. , without cosmological horizon ) have the same stability properties as a non - gravitating one .",
    "stability may change , however , for the supermassive monopole solutions ( @xmath14 ) , because the domain of communication , that is , the boundary condition , is different due to the cosmological horizon .",
    "maison and liebling investigated the spherical perturbations of the supermassive monopole solution@xcite .",
    "they make use of de sitter solutions , which are trivial solutions such that the scalar field stays at the top of the potential barrier and exists for any value of the vev of the scalar field . by their analysis",
    "the stability change of the de sitter solutions occurs at @xmath15 , beyond which the solutions are stable , while unstable below that . and the supermassive monopole solutions emerge just at this value if the vev decreases from a larger value",
    ". this kind of behavior can be seen in a variety of systems in nature and explained by using catastrophe theory .",
    "the supermassive monopole solutions inherit the stability from the de sitter solution with @xmath16 . as a result",
    ", they are stable against the spherical perturbations even if they have a cosmological horizon .    then , are the supermassive monopole solutions really stable ? we have to examine this question carefully .",
    "this is because the polar perturbation pushes the scalar field configuration of the de sitter solution to one direction in the internal space from the top of the potential barrier . in the anti - de sitter background ,",
    "such a solution can be stable even in the tachyonic situation if the effective mass of the scalar field satisfies the breitenlohner - freedman bound@xcite . in the de sitter case , however , it is easy to imagine the scalar field rolls down to its vev , i.e. , the solution is unstable .",

    "these equations are integrated with suitable boundary conditions . at the center",
    "the spacetime should be regular . by expanding these equations , we find @xmath31 can be regarded as a free parameter , which is determined by the other boundary condition at @xmath32 ( for the ordinary global monopole case ) or @xmath33 ( for the supermassive global monopole case ) . for the ordinary global monopole solution",
    "the spacetime approaches asymptotically flat spacetime ( which implies that the curvature vanishes ) with deficit solid angle @xmath34 @xmath35 on the other hand , we impose the existence of the regular cosmological horizon at @xmath11 for the supermassive global monopole .",
    "there is a trivial de sitter solution @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",

    "asymptotically it becomes the de sitter spacetime  @xcite . at @xmath53",
    "the solution coincides continuously ( at least in the domain of the communications ) with the de sitter solution .",
    "this can be seen in the behavior of the parameter @xmath31 as shown in fig .",

    "this kind of study was performed by using catastrophe theory and applied for the black hole spacetimes@xcite",
    ". however , are the supermassive global monopoles really stable even for the non - spherical perturbations ? the o(3 ) field which constructs the de sitter solution is always on the top of the mexican hat potential , which seems unstable .",
    "it is easily imagined that the scalar field rolls down to their vev by just pushing it in one direction in the internal space .",
    "we investigate this problem in the next section .",
    "now , we investigate time dependent perturbations of the de sitter solutions which are non - spherical in the internal space .",
    "we perturb one component of the @xmath0 scalar field @xmath55 note that the metric functions are not affected by this perturbation since the back reaction is second order , and we can consider the de sitter spacetime as a background . if the perturbation equation allows a solution with imaginary @xmath56 , the mode function evolves exponentially with time .",

    "this is the exactly the same form as the eqs .",
    "( 37)-(39 ) in ref .  @xcite in the de sitter case . in that paper",
    "it was shown that these equations always have at lease one negative eigenmode for any value of @xmath22 and @xmath1 .",
    "hence , it is concluded that all the de sitter solutions which we consider here are unstable .",
    "since the de sitter solutions have polar instabilities , the self - gravitating global monopoles may inherit them .",
    "hence we study the polar perturbation of the global monopoles in general relativity carefully in this section and the following section .",
    "the polar deformation of the @xmath0 scalar field was proposed by goldhaber@xcite .",

    "goldhaber pointed out that the first two terms in @xmath79 are in the same form as the energy of a sine - gordon soliton , which implies that the energy is invariant under translation of coordinate @xmath74 ( or @xmath80 ) .",
    "thus , he concluded that the global monopoles have instability if there is a deviation in which @xmath81 and @xmath82 are held .",
    "rhie and bennett proved , however , that such a collapse does not occur , if the monopole core is free to move@xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath80 and @xmath83 are small .",

    "if @xmath80 has @xmath86 dependence , we will get @xmath87 the solution of this equation is @xmath88 , which is unphysical because @xmath80 violates the perturbative approximation around the axis .",
    "the same feature appears in the case that only @xmath83 is considered .",
    "consequently , we can conclude that perturbation only with either @xmath80 or @xmath83 does not occur when the self - gravity is set to zero .",
