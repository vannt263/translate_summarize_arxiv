    "in this talk we give a brief discussion of the recent developments in the analyses of the muon anomaly . first , we will discuss the recent brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) result on @xmath0@xcite ( @xmath7 where g is the gyromagnetic ratio ) and its standard model prediction .",
    "we then discuss the supersymmetric electro - weak effects on @xmath0 .",
    "we will also discuss briefly the effects of extra dimensions on @xmath0 .",
    "finally we will discuss the implications of the bnl result for the direct detection of supersymmetry .",
    "the anomalous moment is a sensitive probe of new physics since    @xmath8    thus @xmath0 is more sensitive to new physics relative to @xmath9 even though @xmath9 is more accurately determined@xcite since @xmath10 .",
    "regarding the experimental determination of @xmath0 one has first the classic cern experiment of 1977@xcite which gave @xmath11 .",
    "the error in this measurement was reduced by a factor of 2 in 1998 by the bnl experiment@xcite which gave @xmath12 , and the same error was further reduced by a factor of 3 by the most recent bnl result@xcite , i.e. ,    @xmath13    the standard model contribution consists of several parts@xcite    @xmath14    where the qed correction is computed to order @xmath15@xcite @xmath16 and @xmath17 including the one loop@xcite and the two loop@xcite standard model electro - weak correction is @xmath18 the most difficult part of the analysis relates to the hadronic contribution .",
    "it consists of several parts : the @xmath19 hadronic vacuum polarization contribution , the @xmath20 hadronic correction , and the light - by - light contribution .",
    "the @xmath19 hadronic vacuum polarization contribution can be related to observables .",
    "specifically one can write    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a kinematical factor .",
    "the integral in eq.(6 ) is dominated by the low energy part , i.e. , the part up to 2 gev , which correspondingly is also very sensitive to errors in the input data . in the evaluations of eq.(6 )",
    "one uses a combination of experimental data at low energy and a theoretical ( qcd ) extrapolation in the high energy tail .",
    "the analysis of @xmath24 is the most contentious part of the analysis . in computing the difference @xmath25 , bnl used the result of davier and hoker@xcite ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "however , other estimates have appeared more recently and we will mention these later . the @xmath20 hadronic correction can also be related to observables but is generally small with a correspondingly small error@xcite , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "the light - by - light hadronic correction is the second most contentious part of @xmath28 .",
    "this part can not be related to any observables and is thus a purely theoretical construct . in the free quark model it evaluates to a positive contribution . however , more realistic analyses give a negative contribution@xcite , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "this result which is though more reliable than the result from the free quark model , still has a degree of model dependence .",
    "overall , however , @xmath30 is not the controlling factor in interpreting the bnl result unless , of course , its sign is reversed .",
    "the total result then is @xmath31 which gives    @xmath32    together one finds , @xmath33 and a @xmath34 sigma deviation of experiment from theory ,    @xmath35    after the new @xmath36 result from brookhaven became available , there have been several reanalyses of the hadronic uncertainty@xcite .",
    "thus , e.g. , the analysis of ref.@xcite gives @xmath37 and of ref.@xcite gives @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "one finds that the difference @xmath40 in these analyses is somewhat smaller and the error somewhat larger compared to the result of eq.(9 ) .",
    "similar trends are reported in the analyses of refs.@xcite .",
    "an interesting assessment of the hadronic contribution and the possibilities for improvement in the future is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "for the discussion of the rest of this paper we will assume the validity of eq.(9 ) .",
    "one may ask what is the nature of new physics in view of eq.(9 ) . some possibilities that present themselves are supersymmetry , compact extra dimensions , muon compositeness , technicolor , anomalous w couplings , new gauge bosons , lepto - quarks and radiative muon masses . we shall focus here mostly on supersymmetry as the possible origin of the difference observed by the bnl experiment .",
    "supersymmetry has many attractive features .",
    "it helps to stabilize the hierarchy problem with fundamental higgs , and it leads to the unification of the gauge coupling constants consistent with the lep data . to extract meaningful results from susy models ,",
    "however , one needs a mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "there are several mechanisms proposed for the breaking of supersymmetry such as gravity mediated , gauge mediated , anomaly mediated etc .",
    "we focus in this paper mainly on the gravity mediated models , i.e. , the supergravity ( sugra ) unified models@xcite . in the minimal version of this model based on a flat khler potential , ie . ,",
    "msugra , the susy breaking sector is described by the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath41 is the universal scalar mass , @xmath42 is the universal gaugino mass , @xmath43 is the universal trilinear coupling , @xmath46 where @xmath47 gives mass to the up quark and @xmath48 gives mass to the down quark and the lepton , and @xmath1 is the higgs mixing parameter . the use of the curved khler potential results in a sugra model with non - universalities consisting of the minimal set of soft susy parameters and additional parameters which , for example , describe deviations from universality in the higgs sector and in the third generation sector .",
    "some of the interesting features of sugra models include the fact that the radiative breaking constraints of the electro - weak symmetry leads to the lightest neutralino being the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and thus under the constraint of r parity the lightest neutralino is a possible candidate for dark matter over most of the parameter space of the model .",
    "also , analyses in sugra models show that the lightest higgs must have a mass @xmath49 gev under the usual assumptions of naturalness , i.e. , @xmath50  tev .",
    "finally , sugra models bring in new sources of cp violation which in any case are needed for baryogenesis .",
    "thus , msugra has two soft cp violating phases while , many more soft cp violating phases arise in non - universal sugra models and in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . regarding some of the other alternatives of susy breaking , one finds that the gauge mediated breaking ( gmsb ) does not produce a candidate for cold dark matter , while the anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) scenario now appears very stringently constrained by the bnl data when combined with its specially characteristic @xmath51 constraint .",
    "our analysis in msugra includes two loop renormalization group evolutions ( rge ) for the couplings as well as soft parameters with the higgs potential at the complete one - loop level  @xcite minimized at the scale @xmath52 for radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we have also included the susy qcd corrections  @xcite to the top quark ( with @xmath53 gev ) and the bottom quark masses and we have used the code _ feynhiggsfast _",
    "@xcite for the mass of the light higgs boson .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 vanishes in the exact supersymmetric limit@xcite and is non - vanishing only in the presence of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "not surprisingly then @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) is sensitive to the nature of new physics@xcite .",
    "thus the analysis of @xmath55 requires a realistic model of supersymmetry breaking . the first such analysis within the well motivated sugra model",
    "was given in refs.@xcite .",
    "we reproduce here partially the result of ref.@xcite    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the chargino contribution and @xmath59 is the neutralino contribution .",
    "the chargino contribution is typically the larger contribution over most of the parameter space and is    @xmath60    here @xmath61 are the left(right ) chiral amplitudes    @xmath62    @xmath63    where @xmath64 if the light chargino eigenvalue @xmath65 is positive ( negative ) , and @xmath66 are mixing angles .",
    "we wish to point out that the most dominant contribution to @xmath67 comes from the chirality non - diagonal lighter chargino part of @xmath58 .",
    "first we note that for the most contributing term in the chargino part the coupling is proportional to @xmath68 and thus @xmath0 increases almost linearly with @xmath44 @xcite ; second due to the same dominant term the sign of @xmath55 is correlated strongly with the sign of @xmath1 ( we use here the @xmath1 sign convention of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to exhibit this by considering the eigenvalues @xmath69 ( i=1,2 ) of the chargino mass matrix ( where we define @xmath65 as the eigenvalue corresponding to the lighter chargino ) that @xmath70 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 except for @xmath74 , which leads to@xcite @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "in the following analysis we assume cp conservation . under this constraint and setting @xmath77 , we immediately find that the bnl data determines@xcite @xmath78 . in imposing the bnl constraint we use a @xmath79 corridor @xmath80    we utilize eq.(14 ) in determining the allowed parameter space of msugra using the one loop formula for which the chargino part is given by eq.(11)@xcite .",
    "[ the leading order correction to one loop as computed in ref.@xcite gives a fractional contribution of @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an average sparticle mass .",
    "this is typically less than @xmath83 and is ignored in the analysis here . ] in fig.[tan10 ] we give an analysis of this constraint in the @xmath84 plane for the case of @xmath85 .",
    "one finds that there is now an upper limit on @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "interestingly , we find that the allowed region of the parameter space which is below the @xmath86 line allows for a light higgs consistent with the lower limit of about 115 gev as given by the possible signal at lep@xcite .",
    "the white region close to @xmath42 axis in fig.[tan10 ] is excluded for stau turning to be the lsp .",
    "the left side white region near the @xmath41 axis is excluded by the constraints from chargino mass lower limit or radiative electro - weak symmetry breaking .",
    "next we discuss the case of a large @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "this is the largest @xmath44 before one gets into a non - perturbative domain for most of the parameter space .",
    "the results of the analysis on the allowed parameter space in the @xmath84 plane are given in fig.[tan55 ] consistent with the constraints of eq.(14 ) .",
    "one finds that in this case there is both a lower limit and an upper limit and the allowed parameter space is the shaded area contained between the lines .",
    "the white region near @xmath41 axis for larger @xmath41 and smaller @xmath42 values is excluded because of the chargino mass lower limit or the radiative electro - weak symmetry breaking constraints .",
    "the white region near @xmath42 axis having smaller @xmath41 values is excluded via the tachyonic stau constraint and the region just above this , corresponding to moderately large @xmath41 values is excluded because of the cp - odd higgs boson turning tachyonic at the tree level which is a large @xmath44 effect . again",
    "the higgs signal corresponding to the lep lower limit is indicated by the solid near vertical line and is seen to lie in the allowed region of the parameter space .",
    "a full analysis was carried out including also values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 in ref.@xcite .",
    "we discuss the results of the full analysis from the point of view of sparticle spectra . in fig.[ch_5_10 ]",
    "the upper limits in sneutrino - light chargino plane are given for @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "a similar analysis is given for @xmath92 , and @xmath93 in fig.[ch_30_45_55 ] . from fig.[ch_5_10 ] and fig.[ch_30_45_55 ] one finds , as expected , that there are strong correlations between the upper limits and @xmath44 . using the entire data set in fig.[ch_5_10 ] and fig.[ch_30_45_55 ]",
    "one finds ,    @xmath94    the corresponding limits in the @xmath84 plane are    @xmath95    the upper limits that arise in msugra from the analysis of ref.@xcite are consistent with the fine tuning criteria ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , and are very encouraging from the point of view of discovery of superparticles at colliders .",
    "thus lhc can discover squarks and gluinos up to 2 tev@xcite .",
    "this means that essentially all of the squark and gluino mass spectrum allowed within msugra by the brookhaven @xmath36 constraint will become visible at lhc@xcite .",
    "a comparison of the upper limits in the @xmath96{2}}$ ] plane allowed by the g-2 constraint vs the discovery potential of the lhc is given in the work of baer et.al .",
    "in ref.@xcite and we reproduce one of the figures from that analysis here(see fig.[mnewsugra ] ) .",
    "many further investigations of the implications of the bnl result have been carried out over the recent months@xcite exploring the effects of the @xmath36 constraint on a variety of low energy phenomena such as on @xmath97 , dark matter , lepton flavor violation , trileptonic signal@xcite and on other low energy susy signals .",
    "we briefly discuss two of these : @xmath97 and dark matter . regarding @xmath97 ,",
    "the standard model branching ratio for this process is estimated to be@xcite @xmath98@xmath99 @xmath100@xmath101 .",
    "recent experiment gives@xcite @xmath98@xmath99@xmath102 @xmath101 where the first error is statistical , and there are two types of systematic errors .",
    "now it is well known that the imposition of the @xmath97 constraint puts severe limits on the msugra parameter space when @xmath73 eliminating most of the parameter space in this case@xcite .",
    "thus had the sign of @xmath1 from the bnl experiment turned out to be negative it would have eliminated most of the parameter space of the minimal model . on the other hand for the @xmath71 case one",
    "finds that the constraint @xmath97 is much less severe .",
    "thus most of the parameter space of msugra in this case at least for small and moderately large values of @xmath44 is left unconstrained . for large values of @xmath44 nearing 50",
    "the @xmath97 constraint does become more stringent but a significant part of the parameter space is still allowed@xcite .",
    "however , it has been emphasized in ref.@xcite that @xmath98 is not a pure observable and requires hard cuts for its extraction experimentally .",
    "this provides a note of caution on imposing the @xmath98 constraint too stringently .",
    "a closely related phenomenon that is sensitive to the sign of @xmath1 is the analysis of dark matter .",
    "it was shown in the early days when the first measurement of @xmath97 was made that the @xmath97 branching ratio has a strong correlation with the neutralino - proton cross - sections in the direct detection of dark matter@xcite in regard to the sign of @xmath1 .",
    "this happens due to the fact that the neutralino - proton cross - sections are smaller for the case of @xmath73 than for the case of @xmath71 .",
    "additionally , with the @xmath97 constraint which eliminates most of the parameter space for @xmath73 , one finds that the neutralino - proton cross sections to be very small for the available region of parameters for this sign of @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , direct detection of neutralino dark matter is strongly disfavored for @xmath73 as opposed to what one finds for @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the fact that the bnl experiment determines the @xmath1 sign to be positive is indeed good news for the direct detection of dark matter@xcite .",
    "we now turn to a brief discussion of models other than msugra .",
    "one such model is amsb .",
    "the details of this model and procedure for its implementation can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the analysis for this case is given in ref.@xcite where the upper limits in the sneutrino - chargino plane corresponding to three values of @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath103 , and 40 ( the maximum allowed ) were analyzed which produced upper limits of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "these limits are lower than those of eq.(15 ) .",
    "further , for @xmath71 , one finds that the constraint from @xmath97 in this case excludes a significant amount of parameter space when the bnl @xmath36 constraint is imposed@xcite .",
    "further , analyses within the framework of the unconstrained supersymmetric standard model , and analyses within more general scenarios and their implications for colliders are given in works of refs.@xcite .",
    "one possibility which must be discussed along with supersymmetry is that of contributions from extra space time dimensions to @xmath36 . in ref.@xcite",
    "a class of realistic models with extra spacetime dimensions were considered ( for reviews see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that for the case of one extra dimension compactified on @xmath106 with matter and higgs fields residing on the orbifolds and the gauge fields propagating in the bulk , the massless spectrum of the model coincides with the massless spectrum of mssm .",
    "the kaluza - klein modes for w contribute to the fermi constant and the current good agreement between the standard model determination of @xmath107 and its experimental value leaves only a small error corridor in which the contributions from extra dimensions can reside .",
    "this constraint leads to a lower limit of about 3 tev on the inverse compactified dimension and severely constrains the contribution of extra dimensions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "one finds that for the case of one extra dimension , the contribution of kaluza - klein states is smaller than the supersymmetric contribution by more than two orders of magnitude . for the case of more than one extra dimension ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath0 is larger than for the case of one extra dimension but still significantly smaller than the one arising from supersymmetry .",
    "thus we conclude that models with extra dimensions of the type considered in ref.@xcite do not create a strong background relative to the supersymmetric effects ( see , however , the analysis of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in this review we have given a brief summary of the developments on the analyses of the muon anomaly .",
    "implications of the difference @xmath25 seen at bnl for supersymmetric models and specifically for msugra were explored .",
    "an effect of the size seen at brookhaven for @xmath25 was already predicted within the sugra model in 1984 where it was found that the supersymmetric correction could be as large or larger than the standard model electro - weak correction@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have also explored the implications of the bnl result for the direct detection of supersymmetry at accelerators and in dark matter searches .",
    "thus a detailed analysis within msugra of the bnl result using a @xmath79 error corridor on the difference @xmath25 leads to upper limits on sparticle masses which all lie below 2 tev . since the lhc can discover squarks and the gluino up to 2 tev , most if not all of the sparticles should become visible at lhc .",
    "further , it was pointed out that the bnl data determines the sign of @xmath1 to be positive within the minimal model which is very encouraging for direct dark matter searches .",
    "it was also pointed out that there is little chance of confusing the supersymmetric contribution to @xmath0 with effects from extra dimensions .",
    "this is so at least in models where the standard model is obtained by a direct compactification of a five dimensional model on @xmath106 which gives a contribution to @xmath0 from kaluza - klein excitations , significantly smaller than a typical supersymmetric contribution .",
    "the bnl data also imposes impressive constraints on cp phases .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the bnl constraint eliminates up to 60 - 90% of the parameter space in the @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( phase of @xmath110 ) plane . in the presence of phases the relationship between the sign of @xmath55 and the phase of @xmath1",
    "may also be modified .",
    "there is a significant amount of data from the run of 2000 which would be analyzed in the near future and bnl eventually hopes to measure @xmath0 to an accuracy of @xmath111 .",
    "analyses including data from beijing@xcite , from novosibirsk@xcite and additional @xmath112 data from cleo@xcite should delineate the hadronic error more reliably .",
    "further if deviation between theory and experiment persists at the current level after the analysis of the new data currently underway is carried out , and if also the error corridor shrinks then a signal for new physics will be undeniable .",
    "such a signal interpreted as arising from supersymmetry then has dramatic new predictions for the direct observation of sparticles at accelerators .",
    "further , if supersymmetry is the right explanation for such an effect , and there is a great bulk of theoretical reasoning in justification of this expectation , then the search for a fundamental higgs boson becomes all the more urgent .",
    "thus , the brookhaven @xmath36 result further heightens the expectation for the observation of a light supersymmetric higgs boson at runii of the tevatron",
    ". finally , we point out that the bnl constraint , specifically the positivity of @xmath1 for a class of models , has an important implication for yukawa unification in grand unified models@xcite and this area is likely to be explored further in the future .",
