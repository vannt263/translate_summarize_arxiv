    "from accreting stellar - mass black holes in our galaxy to distant active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , outflow velocities approaching the speed of light are common in nature .",
    "indeed , the number of known sources capable of generating relativistic ejecta has expanded in recent years to include a core - collapse supernova without an accompanying grb ( sn2009bb ; @xcite ) , as well as the presumed tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole @xcite . with revolutionary new time - domain facilities slated to come online in the coming decade , even more exotic examples will surely be uncovered .",
    "time - variable high - energy emission ( x - rays and @xmath7-rays ) tends to be the hallmark of such relativistic outflows .",
    "yet there is good reason to expect that some relativistic outbursts may lack a detectable high - energy signature . in the case of grbs , for example",
    ", the most mundane possibility is a lack of sky coverage : the most sensitive high - energy grb detectors cover only a fraction of the sky at any given time .",
    "but other , more interesting possibilities exist , including viewing - angle effects @xcite and some physical process suppressing the high - energy emission entirely @xcite .",
    "the search at longer wavelengths for these `` orphan '' ( i.e. , off - axis ) afterglows or `` dirty fireballs '' has remained one of the most sought - after goals in the grb field for more than a decade .    in this work ,",
    "we report the discovery by the palomar transient factory of ptf11agg , a rapidly fading optical transient associated with a year - long , scintillating radio counterpart .",
    "the detection of a faint , blue , quiescent optical source at the transient location suggests a cosmological origin for the transient ( i.e. , well beyond the milky way and any nearby galaxies ) . at such distances ,",
    "the observed radio emission requires the presence of relativistic ejecta .    throughout this work ,",

    ", the true power - law index will be smaller than what we have inferred , and more consistent with most previously observed grb optical afterglows .",
    "if the outburst actually occurred earlier , the decay index would steepen somewhat .",
    "but temporal indices @xmath55 are ruled out based on the nondetection on 2011 january 29 .",
    "here we wish to estimate @xmath56 , the _ a posteriori _ likelihood that the coincident quiescent counterpart detected at late times in our keck / lris imaging is unrelated to ptf11agg ( i.e. , the transient source ) .",

    "we therefore consider it highly likely that this source is the quiescent counterpart of ptf11agg ; however , we consider alternative possibilities below as well .        we began radio observations of the field of ptf11agg with the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao ) karl g.  jansky very large array ( vla ; @xcite ) on 2011 march 11 ( @xmath60d ) .",
    "the array was in the `` b '' configuration until 2011 may 6 , then the `` bna '' configuration until 2011 june 1 , and the `` a '' configuration thereafter . over the course of our monitoring , the angular resolution ranged from 03 to 12 .",
    "the vla data were reduced with the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . for flux calibration",

    ", we have verified that flux measurements of our phase calibration sources remain stable throughout the course of our observations .",
    "we observed ptf11agg at high frequencies ( mm wavelengths ) with the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) beginning on 2011 march 14 ( @xmath61d ) and continuing for approximately one month . for our carma observations ,",
    "the array was in the `` d '' configuration , and the beam had an angular diameter of 10 .",
    "the total bandwidth ( lower sideband and upper sideband ) was 8ghz , and the local oscillator frequency was 93.6ghz .",
    "the optical depth at high ( 230ghz ) frequency ranged from fair ( @xmath62 ; phase noise @xmath63 ) on march 14 and april 11 , to good ( @xmath64 ; phase noise @xmath65 ) on april 7 .",
    "data were reduced using standard techniques within the miriad environment @xcite .",
    "a transient radio counterpart was detected with both facilities .",
    "the radio counterpart was unresolved ( smallest beam size of @xmath66mas ) and consistent with zero circular polarization ( @xmath67% ) at all epochs .",

    ", we must interpolate the various observing frequencies to a common epoch . to provide the longest lever arm",
    ", we perform this analysis at the two epochs of our 93ghz carma detections : 2011 march 14.05 ( @xmath68d ) and 2011 april 7.03 ( @xmath69d ) .",
    "we have linearly interpolated flux - density measurements made immediately before and after these epochs at frequencies of 5 and 8ghz . due to the relatively sparse coverage at 22ghz",
    ", we have simply adopted the flux density at the closest epoch in time ( note that for 2011 march 18 we averaged the two 22ghz measurements obtained on this day ) .",
    "the resulting seds are plotted in figure  [ fig : radsed ] .",
    "we fit a power law of the form @xmath70 to the data , where @xmath41 is the flux density ( in @xmath42jy ) , @xmath71 is the observing frequency ( in ghz ) , @xmath72 is the power - law spectral index , and @xmath45 is the flux density at a fiducial frequency of 1ghz .",
    "for the first epoch ( @xmath73d ) , we find @xmath74 . on the second epoch ( @xmath69d )",
    ", we measure @xmath75 . given the relatively large degree of variability ( see below ) , together with the sparse coverage at high frequencies , we adopt @xmath76 as an approximate spectral slope in the radio for the remainder of this work .",

    "adopting @xmath83k in equation  [ eqn : tb ] thus implies a lower limit on the angular diameter of the source : @xmath84    as can be seen from equation  [ eqn : size1 ] , the strictest lower limits on the size of the emitting region are derived from observations at the lowest frequencies ( assuming a power - law spectral index @xmath85 ) . using our 4.5ghz observation on 2011 march 13",
    ", we find @xmath86@xmath42as . most of our early observations at 5 and 8ghz yield comparable ( though slightly less strict ) limits .",
    "separately , we can constrain the angular size of the source from the detection of interstellar scattering and scintillation ( iss ; @xcite ) . to quantify the degree of variation induced by the scattering electrons , we calculate the modulation index , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the variance of the flux density ( with respect to an assumed model ) , @xmath89 is the average of the square of the individual measurement uncertainties , and @xmath90 is the average of the flux density .",
    "we calculated the modulation indices at 5 and 8ghz , neglecting higher frequencies due to the relative lack of observations .",
    "we fit the light curves at both frequencies to a power - law model of the form @xmath91 , finding best - fit temporal indices of @xmath92 ( i.e. , consistent with no temporal evolution ) and @xmath93 .",
    "this power - law model then forms the reference which we use to calculate the variance at each frequency . in this manner , we find @xmath94ghz@xmath95 and @xmath96ghz@xmath97 .",
    "we use the galactic electron density distribution model of @xcite to derive the relevant iss parameters , namely @xmath98 , the transition frequency between the strong and weak scattering regimes . for the line of sight to ptf11agg ( galactic coordinates @xmath99 ,",
    "@xmath100 ) , we find @xmath101ghz . for a point source , the maximum degree of modulation ( @xmath102 ) will occur at this transition frequency .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to expect our observations at 5 , 8 , and ( possibly ) 22ghz to suffer from some degree of iss .    for @xmath103ghz , our observations at 5 and 8ghz will be in the strong scattering regime ( @xmath104 )",
    "furthermore , given the relatively broad bandwidth of our observations ( @xmath105 ) , we consider only refractive scintillation .",
    "for a point source , the modulation index in the strong , refractive regime is given by @xcite @xmath106 for the line of sight to ptf11agg , we therefore expect a significant degree of modulation for a point source at our observing frequencies : @xmath94ghz@xmath107 , @xmath96ghz@xmath108 .    for an extended source ,",
    "the observed modulation will be reduced by a factor of @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the size of the fresnel scattering disk @xcite , @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the effective distance to the scattering screen ( @xmath113kpc for the line of sight to ptf11agg ) . if we solve for the angular diameter corresponding to the observed degree of modulation at each frequency , we find @xmath114ghz@xmath115@xmath42as and @xmath116ghz@xmath117@xmath42as .",
    "we therefore conclude that the angular size of the emitting region at @xmath118d is @xmath119@xmath42as .        at the time of discovery",
    ", three primary high - energy facilities were monitoring the sky to search for the prompt emission from grbs .",
    "the third interplanetary network ( ipn ; @xcite ) is a group of nine satellites sensitive to high - energy emission .",
    "when multiple satellites detect a grb , the sky localization can be reconstructed from light travel time constraints .",
    "the ipn provides essentially continuous all - sky coverage ( i.e. , 100% duty cycle ) , with a sensitivity to fluences ( 10kev  5mev ) of @xmath120ergcm@xmath58 ( at 50% efficiency ; i.e. , half of the grbs with this fluence are too faint to trigger the ipn detectors ) .",
    "in addition to the ipn , the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ; @xcite ) on the _ fermi _ satellite , and the burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) on the _ swift _ satellite @xcite , also regularly discover a large number of grbs .",
    "the gbm detects bursts down to a 8kev  1mev fluence of @xmath122ergcm@xmath58 , but has a field of view of 8.8sr ( the area of the sky unocculted by the earth in the _ fermi _ orbit ) and a duty cycle of @xmath123% .",
    "likewise , the _ swift _ bat has detected events with 15150kev fluences as low as @xmath124ergcm@xmath58 , but only observes a field of view of 2sr with a duty cycle of @xmath125 .",
    "we caution that , for all three facilities , the high - energy fluence required to trigger the onboard grb algorithms depends on the duration of the event ; therefore , the above sensitivity limits should be treated only as approximate .",
    "we have searched all three facilities for grb triggers from the direction of ptf11agg over the time period from 17:00 2011 january 29 to 5:17 2011 january 30",
    "( i.e. , the outburst onset window derived in  [ sec : onset ] ) .",
    "no triggers were reported by any facility in the direction of ptf11agg during this @xmath126hr window .",
    "we further conducted a search for untriggered events in the gbm data in the energy range 10300kev on several different time scales ( 0.256s , 0.512s , 1.024s , 2.048s , 4.096s , and 8.192s ) and 3.8@xmath13 above background were required for a trigger to register in this search . ] .",
    "no potential high - energy counterparts to ptf11agg were found .    given the field of view and duty cycle of the gbm and bat , there is a significant likelihood that events below the ipn sensitivity threshold would be missed by both instruments .",
    "for example , for a grb with fluence above the gbm sensitivity level ( but below the ipn threshold ) , the probability of a nondetection from _ both _ instruments is as high as @xmath127 ( assuming a uniform and independent distribution of sky pointings for the two instruments ) .",
    "given the relatively large window of time required to search ( i.e. , multiple _ swift _ and _ fermi _ orbits ) , we consider a fluence of @xmath128ergcm@xmath58 ( i.e. , twice the all - sky ipn sensitivity ) a reasonable limit on any high - energy prompt emission associated with ptf11agg .",
    "given the extremely weak correlation between prompt @xmath7-ray fluence and optical afterglow brightness @xcite , this limit is consistent with the known properties of grbs and their afterglows .      to search for an x - ray counterpart",
    ", we obtained observations of the location of ptf11agg with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) on board the _ swift _ satellite on 2011 march 13 ( @xmath129d ) .",
    "data were reduced using the automated pipeline described by @xcite .",
    "no x - ray source is detected at the location of ptf11agg at this time . assuming a power - law spectrum with a photon index of @xmath130 , we derive a @xmath131 upper limit on the 0.310kev flux of @xmath132ergcm@xmath58s@xmath10 .",
    "finally , we note that no historical x - ray emission has been reported at this location , neither in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( 0.12.4kev ; @xcite ) nor in any compilations of known galactic x - ray sources ( accessed via the heasarc and simbad databases ) .",
    "the combination of ( 1 ) a rapidly fading optical transient ( @xmath133mag in @xmath2d ) and ( 2 ) a faint , blue ( @xmath134mag ) , quiescent optical counterpart makes ptf11agg unique amongst the thousands of discoveries by ptf to date . together with ( 3 ) the long - lived ( @xmath135d ) radio emission , here we attempt to simultaneously account for these three distinguishing characteristics .    in order to understand the nature of the emission from ptf11agg",
    ", we must constrain its distance . in this section ,",
    "we first consider a galactic origin by comparing ptf11agg with known classes of galactic transients .",
    "assuming the faint optical source is associated with ptf11agg ( i.e. , the quiescent counterpart ) , the measured color , @xmath136mag , implies a spectral type of @xmath53 f2 ( @xmath137k ) for a main - sequence star .",
    "more conservatively , adopting our 3@xmath13 limit on the color ( @xmath138mag ) , we can rule out single main - sequence stars with @xmath139k ( i.e. , cooler than spectral type k4 ) . given the observed brightness , a main - sequence star hotter than k4 would lie at a distance @xmath140kpc .",
    "this firmly rules out an association with the praesepe cluster ( @xmath141pc ) ; in fact , only 4 globular clusters are known to exist at such large distances in the extreme outer halo of the milky way ( e.g. , am1 at @xmath142kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the extremely small source densities this far in the halo , the inferred lower limit on the radio luminosity at such a distance ( @xmath143ergs@xmath10 ) is three orders of magnitude larger than the most luminous known stellar radio sources ( e.g. , rs cvn binaries , fk com class stars , and algol - class stars ; @xcite ) .    while _ a posteriori _ unlikely , it is nonetheless important to consider that the quiescent optical source may be unrelated to ptf11agg .",
    "absent color information , an optical nondetection , even at the depth of our late - time imaging , is not sufficient to rule out a galactic origin . with their smaller effective temperatures , low - mass stars and brown dwarfs ( in particular ultracool stars , with spectral type later than m7 ) emit little flux in the optical bandpass .",
    "furthermore , ultracool stars are known to exhibit high - amplitude , short timescale ( minutes to hours ) optical and radio outbursts that have in the past been mistaken for extragalactic transients @xcite .",
    "we can use our nir limits on the quiescent emission at the location of ptf11agg to calculate the minimum distance to an ultracool star as a function of spectral type ; in other words , for each spectral type , any object closer than this `` detectability '' distance would be identified in our nir imaging . for spectral types later than @xmath53 m4 , the strongest constraint is provided by our deepest epoch of @xmath37-band imaging : @xmath39mag . using the observed @xmath37-band magnitudes and distance ( parallax ) measurements for ultracool stars from @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we fit a low - order polynomial to calculate the absolute @xmath37-band magnitude as a function of spectral type , @xmath144 , where @xmath145 for m5 , @xmath146 for l2 , etc .",
    "we find the scatter about our derived absolute @xmath37-band magnitude fit is @xmath147mag ( i.e. , 30% ) over the range m5t8 .",
    "we then convert the observed peak radio flux density ( @xmath148@xmath42jy ) to a lower limit on the radio luminosity ( @xmath149 ) using these distance constraints .",
    "the resulting luminosity limits , as a function of spectral type , are plotted in figure  [ fig : mdwarfs ] . for comparison",
    ", we have also plotted all radio observations of ultracool stars from the literature ( see figure caption for references ) .",
    "our luminosity limits are typically at least two orders of magnitude larger than the most luminous known ultracool stellar flares . even comparing with",
    "the recently detected flare from the t6.5 dwarf 2mass j1047 + 21 , by far the coolest brown dwarf detected at radio frequencies @xcite , our limits require a radio luminosity a factor of @xmath150 times larger .",
    "we furthermore see no evidence for a high degree of circular polarization ( common to many , though not all , flares ; @xcite ) , and the radio emission from ptf11agg is much more long - lived than these low - mass stellar outbursts ( durations typically of only hours ) .",
    "in addition to stellar flares , binary systems where one member is a compact object ( white dwarf , neutron star , or black hole ) are known sources of optical and radio outbursts in the milky way .",
    "such a system could circumvent two issues with galactic transients we previously identified .",
    "first , the energy release during the accretion process is more than sufficient to power the observed radio flux ; cyg x-3 @xcite , for example , has reached peak radio luminosities in excess of @xmath151ergs@xmath10 .",
    "second , the presence of an accretion disc can alter the optical color of such systems .",
    "accordingly , our previous inference that the quiescent counterpart must lie at @xmath140kpc would no longer be valid .",
    "we consider first x - ray binaries , where the degenerate primary is a neutron star or black hole .",
    "of particular interest are the subclass of microquasars @xcite , whose powerful radio jets exhibit apparent superluminal motion ( and thus imply a relativistic outflow ) . due to the lack of a bright quiescent optical counterpart , we consider only low - mass systems where the accretion occurs via roche - lobe overflow from the nondegenerate secondary ( low - mass x - ray binaries , or lmxbs ) .",
    "black hole lmxbs are typically characterized by well - defined `` states '' : correlations between x - ray spectra , x - ray flux , and radio emission @xcite .",
    "radio emission is observed in a well - defined region of this hardness - intensity phase space @xcite . in the so - called low - hard state , thought to correspond to low ( @xmath152 ) , radiatively inefficient accretion @xcite , relatively steady radio emission from a jet is observed in most black hole x - ray binary systems . like ptf11agg ,",
    "the radio spectrum is flat or inverted ( @xmath153 , with @xmath1540.5 ) , and circularly unpolarized .",
    "however , a reasonably tight correlation exists between the radio and x - ray luminosity in the low - hard state @xcite , of the form @xmath155 . using the derived formulation from @xcite and the observed radio flux , we would expect an x - ray flux of @xmath156ergcm@xmath58s@xmath10 ( note that this estimate is entirely independent of the distance to the source ) . this is more than an order of magnitude above our derived x - ray limits .",
    "we further note that while neutron star x - ray binaries do not obey the same radio  x - ray correlation in the hard state , the ratio of x - ray to radio luminosity is even larger in these sources @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the most luminous radio flares from lmxbs arise as the system transitions through the intermediate state into a bright , quasi - thermal outburst ( jet emission at the highest x - ray fluxes appears to be largely suppressed ; @xcite ) . unlike the steady radio jets in the low - hard phase ,",
    "this state transition in the accretion flow ( from radiatively inefficient , advection - dominated to geometrically thin , optically thick ; @xcite ) can sometimes cause the ejection of relativistic material @xcite .",
    "while lmxbs in this state do not always follow the same radio  x - ray correlation @xcite , the radio spectrum from this extended emission becomes optically thin .",
    "the x - ray and optical fluxes can rise by several orders of magnitude on a time scale of only a few days during these `` x - ray novae , '' but typically both take many months to return to quiescence @xcite .",
    "ptf11agg differs from these x - ray novae in several major respects .",
    "most importantly , to reach the intermediate ( and , ultimately , high ) state where the radio flare is launched , the compact primary must be accreting material at a substantial fraction of the eddington limit ( @xmath157 110% ; @xcite ) . as a result , these outbursts have been discovered exclusively by wide - field x - ray or @xmath7-ray satellites .",
    "but for any reasonable galactic distance scale ( @xmath158kpc ) , our x - ray limits rule out emission at the level of @xmath159@xmath160 ( for a 1m@xmath161 black hole or neutron star ) .",
    "while our x - ray observations were obtained @xmath162d after the initial optical outburst , this is comparable to the @xmath163-folding time of these systems .",
    "as it requires @xmath164month for the disc mass to accrete onto the neutron star or black hole ( the viscous time scale ; @xcite ) , this time delay alone can not account for the many orders of magnitude gap between our limits and the required x - ray luminosity .",
    "in addition to the lack of bright x - ray emission , we note several more characteristics that distinguish ptf11agg from known x - ray nova outbursts : ( 1 ) the radio emission at late times remains unresolved , which is difficult to reconcile with relativistic ejecta in our galaxy ; ( 2 ) the inverted radio spectrum is inconsistent with the optically thin emission expected at this time ; ( 3 ) the time scale of the optical decay ( @xmath165d ) is significantly shorter than what is observed in x - ray novae ( @xmath16640d ) ; and ( 4 ) the location , well off the galactic plane ( @xmath167 , @xmath168 ) , is inconsistent with the known population of lmxbs @xcite , which have a scale height of @xmath169kpc ( although several prominent counterexamples are known ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we consider systems with a white dwarf accreting material from a ( low - mass ) stellar companion or another white dwarf .",
    "short - timescale optical outbursts have been observed from am cvn systems ( a white dwarf accreting h - poor material in a short - period orbit ) , but never with amplitudes larger than 4 mag @xcite .",
    "dwarf novae , the analogous phenomenon to x - ray novae in lmxbs ( e.g. , disc instabilities ; @xcite ) , have also in the past been mistaken for extragalactic transients @xcite .",
    "in fact , the amplitude and duration of the optical outburst from ptf11agg are not unlike the most extreme dwarf novae . but",
    "dwarf novae rarely exhibit coincident radio emission @xcite , and the few known examples have outburst durations of only @xmath53 12 weeks @xcite , where the radio emission closely follows the optical evolution .    to summarize , we have examined a variety of known classes of galactic transients ( stellar flares , lmxbs , dwarf novae ) , and found that ptf11agg does not fit neatly into any of these categories .",
    "it should go without saying that it is entirely possible that ptf11agg represents a _ new _ type of galactic outburst , characterized by ( 1 ) bright , rapidly fading optical emission ; ( 2 ) a long - lived radio transient ; and ( 3 ) an extremely subluminous ( @xmath170mag for @xmath171kpc ) quiescent optical counterpart .",
    "given the broad agreement between our observations and the properties of long - duration grb afterglows (  [ sec : fireball ] ) , we do not further explore this possibility here .",
    "having rejected a galactic origin for ptf11agg , we now consider the possibility that it resides instead at a cosmological distance ( i.e. , well beyond the local group and into the hubble flow ) . assuming the quiescent counterpart is indeed the host galaxy of ptf11agg , we constrain possible redshifts in  [ sec : photoz ] . even with these crude constraints ,",
    "the angular size derived in  [ sec : size ] requires the presence of a relativistic outflow (  [ sec : relativistic ] ) .",
    "finally , we briefly compare the observed properties with those of known extragalactic sources capable of generating relativistic ejecta in  [ sec : egalcompare ] , and quickly settle on a long - duration grb - like outburst ( i.e. , the core collapse of a massive star ) as the most plausible explanation .      assuming the quiescent optical source is related to ptf11agg (  [ sec : pchance ] )",
    ", we can place an upper limit on its distance based on the absence of redshifted absorption along the line of sight ( i.e. , the lyman break ) .",
    "our @xmath29 detection implies that redshifted ly@xmath44 ( @xmath172 ) falls at an observed wavelength of @xmath173  ( i.e. , the middle of the @xmath29 filter bandpass ) .",
    "this results in an upper limit on the host - galaxy redshift of @xmath174 .    alternatively , assuming a modest rest - frame uv luminosity for the host galaxy ( @xmath175mag , or @xmath176 ; @xcite )",
    ", we place a lower limit on the host redshift of @xmath177 . a similar lower limit",
    "is derived if we compare the observed @xmath18-band brightness with that of known host galaxies of long - duration grbs @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the redshift of ptf11agg should fall somewhere in the range @xmath178 .      in  [ sec : size ] , we derived two independent constraints on the angular diameter of the emitting region from our radio observations : @xmath86@xmath42as at @xmath179d , and @xmath119@xmath42as at @xmath180d . to convert these to constraints on the outflow velocity , we use the redshift limits derived above : @xmath178 ( corresponding to angular - diameter distances of 1.31.8gpc for a concordance @xmath8cdm cosmology ) . assuming ballistic ( i.e. , constant velocity ) expansion , the angular diameter is then given by @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the outflow lorentz factor ( @xmath183 ) , @xmath80 is the speed of light , @xmath184 is the time since outburst ( in the observer frame ) , @xmath185 is the angular - diameter distance , and @xmath186 is the source redshift .    at @xmath187 , where our limits on the outflow velocity are the weakest , we find @xmath188 at @xmath189d , and @xmath190 at @xmath191d .",
    "these limits vary little over our redshift range of interest , due primarily to the limited evolution of the angular - diameter distance over this range : at @xmath192 , we find @xmath193 at @xmath179d , and @xmath194 at @xmath195d .",
    "we therefore conclude that , even at this late time , the ejecta powering the transient emission from ptf11agg are at least transrelativistic . for any more realistic form for the ejecta deceleration ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", we infer that ptf11agg was initially at least a modestly relativistic explosion .",
    "only a handful of extragalactic sources are known to produce relativistic ejecta : grbs , with initial lorentz factors as least as large as several hundred @xcite , and possibly greater than @xmath196 @xcite ; agns , in particular the subclass of blazars , with lorentz factors as large as 50 @xcite ; and the recently discovered relativistic tidal disruption flares ( tdfs ; @xcite ) , with initial lorentz factors @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "though with only one or two examples to date , the known relativistic tdfs do not appear to vary in the optical on time scales as short as those of ptf11agg , where @xmath198d .",
    "furthermore , the seds of these sources are dominated by the soft x - ray ( @xmath16410kev ) bandpass , with peak isotropic luminosities as large as @xmath199ergs@xmath10 .",
    "even at @xmath200 , our x - ray limits (  [ sec : xray ] ) imply @xmath201ergs@xmath10 .",
    "blazars , however , are known to vary in the optical on short time scales ( @xmath202d ) , and have in the past been mistaken for optically discovered grb afterglows @xcite .",
    "but significant ( @xmath203 ) interstellar scintillation is observed only very rarely in blazars ( @xmath204 of the population ; @xcite ) .",
    "more importantly , the degree of optical variability observed from ptf11agg , in particular the amplitude from peak to quiescence ( @xmath205mag in @xmath206month ) , makes this source unlikely to belong to any known agn class @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", a long - duration grb can naturally accommodate all of the observed properties of ptf11agg .",
    "we find that the standard grb afterglow fireball model can accurately reproduce the observed optical and radio light curves (  [ sec : fireball ] ) .",
    "the small initial size of the ejecta explains the observed interstellar scintillation , though this should be quenched as the blast wave expands relativistically ( usually on a time scale of weeks to months ) . and",
    "the faint , blue quiescent optical counterpart is consistent with the long - duration grb host - galaxy brightness distribution for @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the most likely explanation for ptf11agg is a long - duration grb - like ( i.e. , massive star core collapse ) explosion , the first time such an event has been discovered at cosmological distances absent a high - energy trigger .",
    "broadly speaking , there are three reasons why a distant , relativistic outburst may lack detected prompt high - energy emission .",
    "the null hypothesis is a lack of sky coverage ( i.e. , an `` untriggered '' grb ) , as the more sensitive high - energy satellites ( _ swift _ and _ fermi _ ) have only a @xmath207 combined likelihood of detecting any given event (  [ sec : gamma ] ) .",
    "the limiting @xmath7-ray fluence from the only all - sky satellite available ( the ipn ) corresponds to an isotropic @xmath7-ray energy release of @xmath208 ( 2200 ) @xmath209 erg from @xmath187  3.0 .",
    "these values are not sufficiently low to rule out typical cosmological long - duration grbs @xcite , let alone the class of subluminous ( e.g. , grb980425",
    "/ sn1998bw - like ) events uncovered in relatively nearby galaxies @xcite . without any additional information , the simplest explanation is that ptf11agg is an otherwise normal but untriggered long - duration grb .",
    "there exist other , more intriguing , possibilities , however .",
    "the second possible explanation for a grb - like explosion absent any high - energy signature is a viewing - angle effect . due to their high degree of collimation @xcite ,",
    "the prompt emission from most grbs is beamed away from our line of sight . however , the long - lived afterglow emission may nonetheless be visible , either if the region generating the afterglow is less beamed than the @xmath7-ray emitting material ( i.e. , an on - axis orphan afterglow ; @xcite ) , or if , as expected , the outflow spreads laterally at late times and illuminates an increasing fraction of the sky ( i.e. , an off - axis orphan afterglow ; @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery of a _ bona fide _ orphan afterglow would provide robust constraints on the grb beaming fraction , still a large source of uncertainty in calculations of the true energy release and the all - sky rate of grbs .",
    "finally , a source may lack detectable high - energy emission altogether , either because no high - energy photons were produced , or such emission may be unable to escape to distant observers due to some internal suppression mechanism .",
    "it has long been noted ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) that the baryon composition of the relativistic jet in the fireball model must be very finely tuned in order to generate any detectable prompt high - energy emission ( the so - called `` baryon loading problem '' ) . without any baryons in the ejecta , the internal shocks thought to power the prompt emission will not form . but with too large a baryon fraction , the jet will not accelerate to a sufficiently high initial lorentz factor ( @xmath210 ) , inhibiting any high - energy emission via @xmath211@xmath212 pair production @xcite .",
    "such explosions , dubbed `` dirty fireballs , '' have long been predicted @xcite to occur as a result of a modest baryon loading of the jet ; a proton content as small as @xmath213 will lower the initial lorentz factor sufficiently ( @xmath214 ) , yet can still produce the observed broad - band afterglow . distinguishing between a source that produces no high - energy emission whatsoever and one in which these photons are unable to escape is clearly challenging  for the remainder of this work we shall refer to such objects generically as dirty fireballs or afterglows lacking prompt high - energy emission .",
    "here we attempt to discriminate between these competing hypotheses through two different means .",
    "first , we distinguish between on - axis and off - axis models by comparing the observed optical and radio emission with analytic and numerical predictions for grb afterglow light curves in the fireball model (  [ sec : fireball ] ) .",
    "second , we calculate the rate of ptf11agg - like outbursts to determine if it is consistent with the all - sky ( on - axis ) grb event rate (  [ sec : rates ] ) .      in the standard grb afterglow fireball model ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) , relativistic ejecta with ( kinetic ) energy @xmath215 sweep up material in the circumburst medium , forming a collisionless shock and accelerating electrons to a power - law distribution of energies with exponent @xmath216 and minimum lorentz factor @xmath217 . it is assumed that a constant fraction of the total post - shock energy density is partitioned to the electrons ( @xmath218 ) and the magnetic field ( @xmath219 ) .",
    "these accelerated electrons then emit synchrotron radiation , powering the long - lived x - ray , optical , and radio afterglow .",
    "the observed afterglow spectrum depends on the relative ordering of three critical frequencies : the frequency where self - absorption becomes important ( @xmath220 ) , the characteristic frequency of the emission ( @xmath221 ) , and the frequency above which electrons are able to cool efficiently through radiation ( @xmath222 ) .",
    "we shall assume that all our observations occur in the `` slow '' cooling regime ( @xmath223 ) , and that the self - absorption frequency falls below the frequency range probed by our observations ( @xmath224hz ) .",
    "the light curve produced by such emission depends on the radial profile of the circumburst medium into which the shock is expanding .",
    "the simplest circumburst medium to consider is one in which the density is constant ( @xmath225 ) .",
    "this scenario is also referred to as an interstellar medium ( ism ; @xcite ) , and is parametrized in terms of the particle number density @xmath226 , where @xmath227g@xmath228 .",
    "long - duration grbs , however , have been conclusively linked to the deaths of massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the late stages of evolution ,",
    "massive wolf - rayet stars are stripped of their outer h and ( possibly ) he envelopes in a wind , leaving behind a signature @xmath229 density profile that should be discernible in the afterglow light curve .",
    "wind - like environments @xcite are parametrized in terms of @xmath230 , where @xmath231g@xmath228 .",
    "finally , we note that the hydrodynamical evolution also depends on the geometry of the outflow .",
    "grbs are now widely believed to be aspherical explosions @xcite , biconical jets with half - opening angle @xmath232 . at early times , the jet emission is collimated into a narrow cone ( @xmath233 , where @xmath182 is the lorentz factor of the expanding shock ) due to relativistic beaming . as the shock slows , however , simple analytic solutions suggest that lateral spreading of the jet becomes important , and on - axis observers eventually `` miss '' emission from wider angles .",
    "this hydrodynamic transition manifests itself as an achromatic steepening in the afterglow light curve ( the `` jet break '' ) , with an expected post - break decay proportional to @xmath234 . while more recent numerical simulations have suggested a more complex picture of the jet - break phenomenon @xcite , the assumption of a general light - curve steepening around the time when @xmath235 remains largely valid .    at @xmath236d ( the approximate time of discovery )",
    ", we expect the optical bandpass to fall below the cooling frequency ( i.e. , @xmath237 ) .",
    "if we also assume that these early optical data occur before any jet break ( see below ) , the observed temporal decay index ( @xmath238 ) can be translated directly into the electron spectral index @xmath216 . for a constant - density medium ,",
    "we find @xmath239 , while for a wind - like environment , we infer @xmath240 .",
    "electron spectral indices derived from previous observations of long - duration grbs @xcite fall in the range @xmath2413 , so the large uncertainty makes it difficult to distinguish between the competing density profiles solely on this basis .    while the radio emission is relatively variable at @xmath242d , the approximate radio spectral index , @xmath243",
    ", implies that the peak synchrotron frequency @xmath221 is not well below the radio at this time ( or else we would expect @xmath244 ) .",
    "conservatively , we assume @xmath245ghz , and @xmath246@xmath42jy . for a wind - like medium , @xmath247 and @xmath248 . extrapolating back to the time of optical discovery , we conclude @xmath249hz , and @xmath250@xmath42jy . for @xmath251 , @xmath252 .",

    "the general agreement between the fireball model and our optical and radio observations supports our conclusion that ptf11agg is most likely a distant , relativistic explosion like other long - duration grbs .",

    "next we consider limits on the opening angle and observer orientation from the observed optical and radio emission . after the jet break",
    ", the peak synchrotron flux declines linearly with time ( in a constant - density environment ) .",

    ", the modifications to the on - axis afterglow light curves will be more subtle @xcite .",

    "we can understand this result analytically in the following manner .",
    "in the case where the integration time ( @xmath305 ) is much smaller than the period over which a transient is visible ( @xmath306 ) , the number of detectable events at any given time will be @xmath307 where @xmath308 is the field of view ( in steradian ) and @xmath309 is the all - sky event rate .",
    "for long - duration grb optical afterglows , serendipitous detection by ptf will be dominated by the @xmath310 of events that remain brighter than @xmath304mag for @xmath311d ( certainly this is true for those afterglows with @xmath312 ) .",
    "thus , for the ptf project , @xmath313sr ( 7.2deg@xmath17 ) , and adopting @xmath314 0.1 @xmath315 630yr@xmath10 and @xmath316 ( 1d ) , we find @xmath317 events per field .",
    "the expected number of detected events , @xmath318 , will then be @xmath319 , where @xmath320 is the number of ( independent ) measurement epochs . over the two - year period of interest ,",
    "the number of individual p48 images obtained is @xmath321all@xmath322 .",
    "thus , we predict @xmath323 , in good agreement with the results of our monte carlo simulations .",
    "conversely , we can calculate the relative frequency of high - cadence ( @xmath324 $ ] ) observations in our two - year ptf sample by measuring how often each field was observed on a nightly basis .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in the far - right column of table  [ tab : ndet ] . as is evident , high - cadence observations with @xmath320(@xmath325 ) ( i.e. , more than 10 observations of a field obtained in a single night ) occur with a frequency of 1% when compared with regular - cadence fields ( @xmath326 + n_{\\mathrm{obs}}[2]$ ] ) .    from this analysis ,",
    "we conclude that the rate of ptf11agg - like events is inconsistent with the rate of long - duration grbs with 97.4% confidence .",
    "admittedly a number of assumptions went into this analysis , and one should always be careful with results drawn from such an _ a posteriori _ analysis . but independent of the exact likelihood , we conclude that the probability of untriggered afterglow detection in a high - cadence ptf field is small .",
    "either we have been quite lucky , or we may have uncovered a new , more common class of distant , relativistic outbursts lacking entirely in high - energy emission .",
    "it is crucial to verify , however , that our inferred rate does not violate any other limits on short - timescale transients , either from ptf itself , or from previous optical and radio surveys . as highlighted above ,",
    "low - cadence fields are observed significantly more frequently with ptf than high - cadence fields like the beehive .",
    "thus , any short - timescale ( @xmath327d ) transient should be detected in many more @xmath328 and @xmath329 fields than high - cadence fields . in the case of ptf11agg , repeating the above monte carlo simulations for a transient population with five times the grb event rate ( but the same optical brightness distribution ) , we find an expected number of detected sources of @xmath330 in all fields . at first glance ,",
    "the fact that we have not discovered such a population of sources would seem to favor the untriggered grb scenario .",
    "here it is important to distinguish between transient detection , by which we mean a source is above the p48 sensitivity limit on a given image , and discovery , where a transient is flagged as astrophysically interesting ( by software or human beings ; @xcite ) . because of the large number of uncatalogued asteroids near the ptf limit",
    ", our software requires at least two detections at a given location to flag a source as a _",
    "bona fide _ transient ( e.g. , to `` discover '' the source ) .",
    "thus , any ptf11agg - like outburst with only a single detection ( @xmath331 ) will never be discovered by our survey .",
    "likewise , there may be subtle biases limiting our capability to identify and/or conduct follow - up observations of similar short - timescale transients with only a few detections .",
    "whether these discovery biases are sufficient to account for the lack of similar sources in our low - cadence fields with ptf remains to be seen .",
    "we have attempted to search through all ptf discoveries that were detected only on a single night ( independent of @xmath297 ) , but have yet to uncover any additional viable candidates .",
    "ultimately , future wide - field , high - cadence optical surveys may be required to resolve this issue .",
    "finally , we compare our derived rate of ptf11agg - like events with previous searches for orphan optical @xcite and radio @xcite afterglows , to verify that our results are consistent with these limits .",
    "the tightest constraints on the rate of relativistic outbursts come from radio surveys , where @xcite derive a limit on the all - sky volumetric rate of grb - like explosions of @xmath332 events gpc@xmath333 yr@xmath10 . even assuming an all - sky grb rate as large @xcite as 100gpc@xmath333yr@xmath10 ( more recent estimates suggest a significantly smaller value ; @xcite ) , a population of ptf11agg - like events occurring at a rate of @xmath334 times that of normal grbs is consistent with these results .",
    "our derived rate is therefore orders of magnitude lower than the all - sky rate of type ibc supernovae ( @xmath335gpc@xmath333yr@xmath10 ; @xcite ) . it may approach the rate of low - luminosity grbs @xcite , although this depends both on the assumed beaming correction and the true grb rate .",
    "to summarize our results , we report here the discovery of ptf11agg , a rapidly fading optical transient with a long - lived , scintillating radio counterpart . together with the observed optical and radio light curves , the detection of a faint",
    ", blue quiescent counterpart at the location of ptf11agg indicates that the transient likely originated in the distant universe . using our measurements of the source size derived from the radio observations",
    ", we infer that ptf11agg must be powered by a relativistic outflow .",
    "these properties are all consistent with the population of long - duration grb afterglows , marking the first time such an event has been discovered at cosmological distances without a high - energy trigger .    searching various high - energy satellites , we find no potential @xmath7-ray counterpart for ptf11agg .",
    "we therefore consider three possible explanations that can simultaneously account for a grb - like explosion without any associated prompt high - energy emission : an untriggered grb , an orphan afterglow , and a dirty fireball .",
    "using the all - sky rate of grbs discovered by the _ swift _ satellite , together with a measurement of their observed optical brightness distribution , we have calculated the likelihood of serendipitous untriggered grb afterglow detection by ptf ( april 2009  december 2012 ) .",
    "surprisingly , we found that the _ a posteriori _ probability of untriggered grb afterglow detection in a high - cadence field like the one where ptf11agg was found ( 11 observations on a single night ) is only 2.6% .",
    "while we can not rule out entirely our null hypothesis that ptf11agg is an untriggered grb , this probability is sufficiently low that we consider alternative interpretations as well .    the afterglow emission from an orphan grb will rise in flux at early times , as more and more of the jet becomes visible due to relativistic beaming effects . using both analytic and numerical formulations",
    ", we are unable to reproduce the observed ptf11agg light curves unless the observer viewing angle is within the opening angle of the jet .",
    "while these models assume a relatively simple jet structure , the requirement of rising afterglow emission at early times is a robust prediction for all off - axis models .",
    "a more intriguing possibility is that ptf11agg may represent a new class of relativistic outbursts with little or no corresponding high - energy emission . in much the same way that sn2009bb @xcite demonstrated that the more nearby , subluminous class of grbs may generate relativistic ejecta yet lack high - energy emission",
    ", ptf11agg may play an analogous role for the more energetic , cosmologically distant sample of long - duration grbs .",
    "dirty fireballs ( i.e. , a baryon - loaded jet ) are one possible explanation , though alternative possibilities surely exist as well .    in this picture , the inferred rate of ptf11agg - like events must be four times higher ( 90% confidence ) than the rate of on - axis long - duration grbs . when combined with traditional core - collapse supernovae and long - duration grbs",
    ", these objects would enable a more complete census of the deaths of massive stars , and also provide a probe of the location of massive - star formation in distant galaxies without the need for a high - energy satellite trigger .",
    "regardless of its ultimate origin , we expect such sources to be discovered in large numbers by ongoing and future wide - field , high - cadence optical surveys such as the catalina real - time transient survey @xcite , ptf , pan - starrs @xcite , and the large synoptic survey telescope @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the discovery of ptf11agg bodes well for optical surveys in the future era of gravitational wave astronomy , as the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources should exhibit largely similar observational signatures ( though they are also expected to be associated with more nearby galaxies ; @xcite ) .",
