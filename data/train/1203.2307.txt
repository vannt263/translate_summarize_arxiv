    "in a previous paper @xcite we studied the signal of a shock heated cosmic string wake in a position space 21 cm redshift maps .",
    "we pointed out that cosmic string wakes give rise to a pronounced signal in such maps , in particular at redshifts larger than that of conventional reionization .",
    "the signal of a single wake is a wedge which is extended ( a degree or larger for redshifts of @xmath2 ) in both angular directions and thin in redshift direction .",
    "this effect comes from the fact that wakes form overdensities in baryons already at very high redshifts , and that these regions then lead to the extra 21 cm emission or absorption .    in a followup paper",
    "@xcite we computed the angular power spectrum for shock heated cosmic string wakes emitting 21 cm radiation . because of our interest in shock heating in both @xcite and @xcite we focused our attention on those wakes with the greatest kinetic gas temperature @xmath3 .",
    "thus we concentrated our analyses on the wakes formed earliest , @xmath4 and emitting 21  cm radiation as late as possible before reionization , @xmath5 .",
    "this led us to miss the constraints on @xmath0 that shock heated wakes formed at later @xmath6 could provide by considering the absorption of 21  cm radiation .",
    "in this paper we consider these constraints .",
    "furthermore , even if baryons collapsing onto the primordial string wake do not shock heat , the string will nevertheless induce an overdense region of baryons .",
    "this region , however , will be more diffuse than if shock heating occurs .",
    "the wakes will be thicker but the overdensity smaller . in this paper",
    ", we study the 21 cm signal of such a  diffuse \" cosmic string wake .    current constraints on the cosmic string tension from analyses of the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropy maps yield [ limit1 ] g 2.510 ^ -8 .",
    "our new limit is independent of the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , since the signal of a string wake has a very special geometry in position space , position space shape detection algorithms are likely to be able to detect string wake signals even if they do not stick out above the gaussian noise on a pixel by pixel basis .",
    "the situation is similar to what is encountered when searching for cosmic string signals in cmb anisotropy maps : since long string segments produce line discontinuities in the maps , these can be identified by edge detection algorithms such as the canny algorithm @xcite for values of the tension substantially lower than the value for which the string signal dominates on a pixel by pixel basis , as has been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin in section [ sec : csreview ] with a brief review of cosmic strings , their wakes , and their 21 cm signatures .",
    "readers familiar with such results may skip this section .",
    "section [ sec : diffuse - wakes ] is the main part of our work . in this section",
    "we extend the analysis of the 21 cm signature of cosmic string wakes in several ways .",
    "first we consider the constraints on @xmath0 from the absorptions signal of shock heated wakes laid down much later than matter radiation equality .",
    "secondly we analyze the signal of diffuse wakes , that is those wakes in which there is a baryon overdensity but which have not shock heated .",
    "finally we compare the size of these signals to the expected thermal noise per pixel which dominates over the background cosmic gas brightness temperature . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we present our conclusions and put our work in context .",
    "many particle physics models beyond the standard model predict the existence of cosmic strings . in particular ,",
    "cosmic strings are produced at the end of inflation in many models of brane inflation @xcite and in many supergravity models @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings may also survive in early universe models based on superstring theory such as  string gas cosmology \" @xcite . since the amplitude of cosmological signatures of cosmic strings is proportional to the string tension , which itself is set by the energy scale of the new physics , searching for signatures of strings in cosmology",
    "is a way of probing beyond the standard model physics which is complementary to accelerator probes such as the large hadron collider experiments which probe the low energy limit of such theories .",
    "cosmic strings can be used as a cosmological probe of new physics because any particle physics model which admits stable cosmic strings as a solution inevitably results in a a network of such strings forming during a symmetry breaking phase transition in the early universe ( see @xcite for reviews on cosmic strings and cosmology ) .",
    "such a network will persist to the present time and approaches a dynamical attractor configuration , the so - called  scaling solution \" in which the statistical properties of the string network are independent of time if all lengths are scaled to the hubble radius .",
    "the cosmic string scaling solution is charaterized by a random - walk - like network of infinite ( or  long \" ) strings with step length comparable to the hubble radius , plus a distribution of cosmic string loops with radii smaller than the hubble radius .",
    "the typical transverse velocity of a long string segment is the speed of light .",
    "this implies that at all times @xmath9 ( @xmath10 being the time of equal matter and radiation ) relevant for structure formation there are strings which act as seeds for the accretion of matter . the key parameter which characterizes cosmic strings and their cosmological consequences is the mass per unit length @xmath11 .",
    "it is usually quoted in terms of the dimensionless number @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "both long string segments and string loops lead to nonlinearities in the matter distribution at all redshifts up to @xmath14 , the redshift of equal matter and radiation .",
    "cosmic string network simulations @xcite indicate that the long strings have a larger effect than the loops , so we will here focus our attention on the effects of long string segments , as we did in @xcite ( for a recent study of the 21 cm signal of a cosmic string loop see @xcite . ) . in the standard @xmath15cdm cosmology without strings , nonlinear structures are negligible until shortly before the time of reionization .",
    "hence , the signals of cosmic strings should be more and more pronounced against the  noise \" of effects from structure formation in the @xmath15cdm model the higher the redshift is .",
    "21 cm surveys hence appear as an ideal window to probe for the possible existence of cosmic strings .",
    "they probe the distribution of matter at much higher redshifts than galaxy redshift surveys since they map out the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the universe , in particular before the time of reionization . compared to cmb maps ,",
    "21 cm maps have the advantage of yielding three - dimensional information .",
    "the nonlinearity in the matter distribution induced by a long string segment at time @xmath16 takes the form of a  wake \" @xcite whose length is set by the length of the string segment ( which will be similar to the hubble radius @xmath16 ) , whose width is set by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the transverse velocity of the string segment and @xmath19 is the associated relativistic gamma factor , and whose average thickness is proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "the wake formation starts with an initial velocity perturbation and then grows by gravitational accretion .",
    "the velocity perturbation ( see figure  [ fig : wakewedge ] ) stems from the fact that space perpendicular to a long string segment is conical , i.e. flat space with a missing wedge whose deficit angle is @xmath21 .",
    "a string moving through a gas of particles with transverse velocity @xmath18 will hence induce a velocity perturbation @xmath22 of the gas towards the plane behind the string , whose magnitude is given by @xmath23 . .",
    "a cosmic string segment laid down at time @xmath24 ( we are interested in @xmath25 ) will generate a wake with physical dimensions : [ size ] l_1(t_i)l_2(t_i)w(t_i )   =   t_i  c_1   t_i  v_s_s   t_i  4gv_s_s .",
    "where @xmath8 is a constant of order one .",
    "in the above , the first dimension is the length in direction of the string , the second is the depth , and the third is the average width . after being laid down",
    ", the wake will grow by gravitational accretion .",
    "this has been studied using the zeldovich approximation @xcite in a number of works @xcite . in this method of analysis",
    ", we follow the time evolution of the height above the centre of the wake of mass shells to determine the comoving distance @xmath26 which `` turns around '' at time @xmath16 , i.e. for which the physical height @xmath27 is maximal .",
    "we obtain that the comoving thickness grows linearly with the scale factor of the universe .",
    "a wake laid down at redshift @xmath6 will have comoving thickness at redshift @xmath28 given by [ qnl ] q_nl(z ) = ( z_i + 1)^1/21 ( z+1 ) .",
    "the physical height of the shell above the centre of the wake at the time of `` turnaround '' is half what the height would be in the absence of gravitational accretion , and hence the relative overdensity is a factor of 2 .",
    "it is then assumed that the shell collapses to half of the height it had at turnaround , that it then undergoes shocks and virializes at that distance .",
    "then , the overdensity will be a factor of 4 greater than the background density .",
    "this approximate analytical analysis has been confirmed in detailed hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .    during the infall onto the string wake ,",
    "the baryons acquire kinetic energy which during the process of shock heating transforms to thermal energy .",
    "the kinetic temperature @xmath3 acquired by the hydrogen atoms can be obtained from the kinetic energy which particles acquire when they hit the shock front .",
    "this is determined using the zeldovich approximation @xcite.the result obtained in @xcite is t_k [ 20  k ] ( g ) _",
    "6 ^ 2 ( v_s _ s)^2 , where @xmath29 indicates the value of @xmath12 in units of @xmath30 .",
    "the result is expressed in degrees kelvin .",
    "note that the wake kinetic temperature increases as @xmath28 decreases since the wakes have more time to grow , which in turn leads to a growing gravitational potential . since @xmath31 decreases in time , then it is more and more likely that the string wake 21 cm signal will be in emission rather than absorption as @xmath16 increases . however , it turns out that for reshifts significantly larger than that of conventional reionization and for string tensions smaller than the current limit ( [ limit1 ] ) , @xmath3 is smaller than @xmath31 and that hence the string wake signal will be in absorption .",
    "the 21 cm signal of a cosmic string wake has a distinctive geometry .",
    "we will see the string - induced absorption ( or emission ) regions in directions of the sky where our past light cone intersects the cosmic string wake .",
    "these are wedges in the sky of angular scale determined by the comoving hubble radius at the time that the string is formed .",
    "the string wake grows in thickness , but its planar dimensions are constant in comoving coordinates . for wakes formed at a redshift corresponding to recombination",
    "this angular scale is about one degree , for wakes formed at equal matter and radiation slightly smaller .",
    "since photons emitted at the top and bottom of the wake undergo slightly different redshifts , the region in 21 cm redshift surveys of extra emission / absorption takes on the form of a thin wedge in redshift direction with a thickness which is @xcite [ freqwidth ] |zz+1| = || = g v_s _ s ( z_i + 1 ) ^1/2 ( z+ 1 ) ^1/2 ,",
    "the analysis in the previous section neglected the temperature of the gas at the time that the wake was formed .",
    "the accretion onto a string wake further increases the intrinsic gas velocities , leading to an effective gas temperature which is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the temperature of the background gas .",
    "if t_k < 2.5 t_g , then the incoherent velocities due to the thermal motion of the accreted gas dominate over the coherent velocity induced by accretion . in this case",
    ", there is no shock heating , and the thickness of the overdense region induced by the wake is larger than it would be in the absence of thermal motion of the gas particles .",
    "the resulting overdense region we will call a `` diffuse wake '' .",
    "we now estimate the size of the diffuse wake . in linear",
    "cosmological perturbation theory , the total mass accreted by the string wake is the same both in the cases with and without shock heating .",
    "the difference is that the large intrinsic thermal gas velocity will render the wake wider and hence less dense .",
    "the first step is to compute the width @xmath34 of the wake obtained taking into account the gas temperature @xmath33 .",
    "the result is [ height ] h_w(z)|_t_k < t_g = h_w(z)|_t_g = 0  ( ) for @xmath35 .",
    "the diffuse wake will thus be thicker by the ratio of temperatures @xmath36 , but the density of baryons will be smaller by the same factor .",
    "hence , the width of the 21 cm signal induced by a diffuse wake will be thicker in redshift direction by the above ratio of temperatures compared to what is given in ( [ freqwidth ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the 21 cm brightness temperature will be smaller since it is proportional to the baryon density which is smaller than in the case of a shock - heated wake .",
    "the formula ( [ height ] ) for the width of a diffuse wake can be derived by assuming equipartition of energy between thermal energy and potential energy which for @xmath37 yields [ equip ] m_hi = 32t_g , where @xmath38 is the mass of a hydrogen atom and @xmath39 is the gravitational potential induced by the wake .",
    "the latter , in turn , is [ pot ] = 2 g |h| , where @xmath40 is the surface density of the wake , and @xmath41 is the height . combining ( [ equip ] ) with ( [ pot ] ) yields the linear scaling in temperature given in ( [ height ] ) .",
    "the surface density @xmath40 of a diffuse wake is the same as that of a shock heated wake .",
    "it is given by the energy per unit area of matter within a comoving height @xmath42 , the shell which is turning around at redshift @xmath28 .",
    "thus @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the current background density .",
    "the overdensity @xmath45 in the diffuse wake is given by ( z ) = = _ 0",
    "( ) . which results in = ( 1 + ) .",
    "the extra baryon density in the wake leads to extra 21  cm absorption or emission .",
    "the expression for the wake brightness temperature written in terms of kinetic temperature @xmath46 and the hydrogen atom number density @xmath47 is very similar for a shock heated or a diffuse wake .",
    "the only difference is that @xmath46 is the kinetic temperature @xmath3 of the wake when shock heating occurs whereas it should be interpreted as the kinetic temperature of the cosmic gas @xmath33 for diffuse wakes .",

    ". we work with a matter dominated universe for @xmath55 with the age of the universe @xmath56  s. the origin of the @xmath57 factor will be discussed in the appendix , where it will also be shown that this factor does not lead to any physical divergence .    for a shock heated wake ,",
    "the ratio of the wake s hydrogen atom number density to the background density , @xmath58 , is 4 . for a diffuse",
    "wake the relative brightness temperature is lower than for a wake which has undergone shock heating since the number density @xmath47 of hydrogen atoms inside the diffuse wake is smaller , and thus its ratio in ( [ eq : deltatb ] ) to the background density @xmath59 is smaller . for our analysis below we take : = ( 1+t_kt_g )  &   & t_k3",
    "t_g + = 4  &   & t_k 3t_g note that for simplicity we have used @xmath60 instead of @xmath61 .",
    "the brightness temperature signal in ( [ eq : deltatb ] ) discussed in @xcite was compared to the average brightness temperature of the surrounding cosmic gas . between redshift @xmath62 and 35",
    "the average background brightness temperature varies from -0.34  mk to -8.6  mk , respectively .",
    "however the analysis of the signal did not consider beam size nor thermal noise .",
    "in fact for @xmath2 it is the thermal noise , and not the background brightness temperature , that will first limit our ability to detect a cosmic string wake signal .",
    "the opposite is true for @xmath63 .",
    "beam size and thermal noise for the 21  cm brightness temperature were considered in @xcite where their eq .",
    "( 4.19 ) gives the thermal noise per pixel : t_n= ( ) ^3.85 ^1/2 [ tnoiseperpixel ] here @xmath64 is the total observing time and @xmath65 is the effective antenna area . to derive this noise temperature per pixel in @xcite we began with the thermal noise per visibility as given by morales  @xcite to arrive at the thermal noise per pixel for the brightness temperature .",
    "the angular resolution is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the observation frequency and @xmath68 is the baseline .",
    "the angular resolution is assumed to be tuned by a dilution of the array from being fully compact by a simple scaling of all baseline positions by a fixed amount .",
    "the system temperature is given by arcade 2  @xcite .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the noise per pixel resolution dependence given in eq .",
    "[ tnoiseperpixel ] assumes an isotropic resolution in all three spatial directions .",
    "however for a cosmic wake signal , the width is order @xmath69 smaller than the two length directions , whereas each length direction is of order the hubble size . if @xmath70 is the angular resolution needed for the wake s length , then @xmath71 is the angular resolution needed for the width .",
    "thus an appropriate estimate of the resolution in radians needed to calculate the noise per pixel is : _ resolution ( z ) = ( 4g(z_i+1)(z+1))^1/3   _ hubble(z ) = ( 4g(z_i+1)(z+1))^1/3 1(-1 )    hence , in a three dimensional map with the necessary resolution to detect a cosmic string wake laid down at @xmath6 and emitting or absorbing radiation at @xmath28 , the thermal noise per pixel is : t_n^wake= ( z+121)^4.68(1 - 1/)^1/2 where @xmath72 .",
    "we will consider 10 000 hours of total observing time .",
    "evidently for the ska the effective antenna area is 1 sq km . for @xmath73 and @xmath62",
    ", a @xmath74 leads to an average noise per pixel @xmath75 comparable in size to the background brightness temperature .",
    "smaller @xmath0 require a smaller resolution and lead to larger noise per pixel .",
    "hence for @xmath76 the thermal noise dominates over the background brightness temperature for the wake signal .",
    "for example at @xmath73 and @xmath62 a @xmath77 gives a @xmath78 radians , which is 20 minutes of arc , and hence an average noise per pixel of @xmath79 .",
    "for strings laid down at a lower redshift the noise is greater .",
    "the noise is also a rising function of the emission redshift @xmath28 . for a @xmath80 with @xmath81 and 35 , @xmath82 and 2.7   mk , respectively .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dtb20-vs - gu ] we show the relative brightness temperature ( vertical axis ) as a function of @xmath29 ( horizontal axis ) for various values of the redshift @xmath83 of wake formation , evaluated at the redshift @xmath84 .",
    "negative ( positive ) brightness temperature means absorption ( emission ) .",

    "a feature overlooked in our previous work  @xcite is that for a fixed observational redshift @xmath28 , there will be a range of values of @xmath12 for which the wake s brightness temperature @xmath3 will be so close to the background cosmic gasp temperature that there will be no signal . in this situation",
    ", we can consider smaller values of @xmath83 which lead to a clean and large absorption signal .",
    "for each curve in figure  [ fig : dtb20-vs - gu ] it is apparent that there is a kink in the brightness curve ( in the absorption region ) .",
    "this kink occurs at the value of @xmath12 for which @xmath90 , the transition point between a wake with shock heating ( larger values of @xmath12 ) and a diffuse wake .",
    "our previous analysis was only valid until that point .",
    "we see here that with our current work it is possible to extend the range of values of @xmath12 which can be probed by 21 cm redshift surveys .    taking into account that the optimal pixel size will depend on @xmath12 ,",
    "then the pixel noise level will also depend on @xmath12 . in figure",
    "[ fig : dtb20-vs - gu - zoom ] we zoom in on the small @xmath12 region of the previous figure and compare the string signal to the pixel noise .",

    "this is an improvement of the current bound  ( [ limit1 ] ) and demonstrates the potential of 21 cm surveys to probe cosmic strings .    for smaller values of @xmath12 ,",
    "cosmic string wakes will still provide a signal .",
    "the signal has a particular shape in a three - dimensional redshift survey and should hence be detectable using shape detection algorithms for values of @xmath12 much smaller than the above value ( [ limit3 ] ) . in work in progress we are exploring this issue quantitatively .",
    "note that a similar problem arises in the case of identifying cosmic string signatures in cmb temperature maps .",
    "it was shown @xcite that edge detection algorithms provide the promise of pushing the limits of detection several orders of magnitude below the level of the pixel noise , and one order of magnitude lower than limits which can be achieved using cmb angular power spectra studies .",
    "thus , we are optimistic that 21 cm redshift surveys will provide a very promising arena to probe for the possible existence of cosmic strings .",

    "if we are looking for strings of a particular value of @xmath12 we would be focusing on wakes formed at the redshift which yields largest absorption amplitude . since the formation redshift determines the size of the 21 cm wedge which the corresponding wake produces , we can use the size information to optimize the search strategy .",
    "we have extended the analysis of the 21 cm signal of cosmic string wakes to the case when the string tension is too small to yield shock heating of the wake . instead , a  diffuse wake \" forms .",
    "this wake is less dense but thicker than a wake which has undergone shock heating .",
    "hence , the relative 21 cm brightness temperature is smaller in amplitude , but it is extended over a larger redshift interval .    demanding that the relative brightness temperature exceeds the pixel thermal noise in a future 21 cm experiment such as the square kilometre array ( ska ) ( with the pixel size chosen to be able to identify the wake signal , as described in the text ) leads to a limit of @xmath91 , an improvement over the current limit of eq .",
    "( [ limit1 ] ) obtained from cmb anisotropy maps  @xcite .",
    "there are three important comments to make .",
    "first , a limit obtained by direct searches in position space is independent of some of the unknown parameters characterizing the scaling solution of strings ( for example , it is largely independent of the number of strings per hubble volume ) , whereas a bound obtained from the angular correlation function of cmb anisotropies depends on these parameters .",
    "thus , a bound obtained by the methods we describe is more robust . secondly with more statistics ,",
    "even a signal strength below the noise can be detected . and finally , since cosmic string wakes produce signals with a distinguished geometry ( namely thin wedges in redshift maps ) , these signals should be detectable by clever statistical techniques even if the amplitude is substantially smaller than the pixel noise .",
    "an example of a statistical tool which could be used to look for the specific string wake signal is the set of minkowski functionals , statistics designed to characterize the topology of the structure of maps . for a preliminary study of this approach with references to the original literature see @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we present how the @xmath92 factor in the expression for the wake brightness temperature arises from the line profile term @xmath93 .",
    "we also explain why it does not imply any physical singularity in the limit @xmath94 .",
    "we begin with the formula for the relative brightness temperature of photons ( see @xcite and references therein ) [ three3 ] t_b ( ) ( t_s - t _ ) ( 1+z ) _ , where the optical depth @xmath95 is given by [ three5 ] _ = ( ) ( ) .",
    "here @xmath96 is the column density of hi , and @xmath93 is the line profile .    the line profile accounts for the nonzero width of the 21  cm line .",
    "the line profile is a sharply peaked function about @xmath971420 mhz normalized such that ( ) d=1 for the case at hand the line profile is not a dirac delta function because the hubble expansion leads to a velocity gradients along the line of sight . due to this radial velocity gradient",
    ", the emitted 21  cm photons incur a local line broadening which one can interpret as a relative doppler shift .      in particular ,",
    "let us consider photons reaching us at an angle @xmath50 relative to the vertical of the wake having width @xmath98 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : invsin2 ] ) .",
    "there is a relative doppler shift @xmath99 between photons from the front and back of the wake along the photon trajectory .",
    "the horizontal distance @xmath100 along the wake between the back point of the photon trajectory and the photon trajectory exiting the wake is given by d = w .",
    "the relative doppler shift is due to the hubble expansion of the planar dimensions of the wake .",
    "thus , the component of this expansion velocity in direction of the photon trajectory is given by v_// = h d = h w ^2 , and we have a frequency width given by = v_//   _ 21 the line profile is [ three8 ] ( ) = for [ _ 21 - , _ 21 + ] , and @xmath101 otherwise .",
    "for a frequency within the range of 21 cm radiation passing through the wake the relative brightness temperature is given by ( [ eq : deltatb ] ) .",
    "this makes the origin of the @xmath92 factor manifest .",
    "any actual measurement will have a finite frequency resolution .",
    "if we integrate over a frequency interval larger than @xmath99 , the @xmath92 factor will cancel as it must .",
    "if we have a very small frequency resolution @xmath102 , then the brightness temperature density at a fixed @xmath103 will increase as @xmath50 decreases until @xmath99 becomes smaller than @xmath102 .",
    "from that point onwards , the result will be independent of @xmath50 .",

    "<S> the analysis of the 21 cm signature of cosmic string wakes is extended in several ways . </S>",
    "<S> first we consider the constraints on @xmath0 from the absorption signal of shock heated wakes laid down much later than matter radiation equality . </S>",
    "<S> secondly we analyze the signal of diffuse wake , that is those wakes in which there is a baryon overdensity but which have not shock heated . </S>",
    "<S> finally we compare the size of these signals to the expected thermal noise per pixel which dominates over the background cosmic gas brightness temperature and find that the cosmic string signal will exceed the thermal noise of an individual pixel in the square kilometre array for string tensions @xmath1 . </S>"
