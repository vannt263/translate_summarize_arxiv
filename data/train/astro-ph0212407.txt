    "bent double - lobed radio sources ( particularly fr i - type sources [ fanaroff & riley 1974 ] , including wide - angle tails [ wats ] and narrow - angle tails [ nats ] ) are thought to achieve their distinct `` swept - back '' , c - shaped morphologies as a result of interaction with dense gas in which they are embedded .",
    "the canonical model describes the radio source s host galaxy as having a significant peculiar velocity relative to the cluster with which it is associated  the ram pressure of the dense icm then pushes back the lobes of the radio source giving it a `` bent '' appearance ( owen & rudnick 1976 ) . often , the host galaxies of wat radio sources are cd ellipticals , thought to reside at the bottom of cluster potential wells , and are thus not expected to have significant peculiar velocities . an alternate explanation ( burns et al .",
    "1994 ) , posits bulk motion of the icm as a result of a recent or ongoing cluster - cluster ( or sub - cluster ) merger .",
    "the ram pressure of the merging gas then bends the lobes . either way , bent - double radio sources are often pointers to clusters , and they may be flags in particular for clusters that have recently formed or merged .",
    "we have selected 384 bent - double ( mostly wat ) radio sources from the first 3000 deg@xmath8 of the vla _ first _ ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ) survey ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) .",
    "imaging and multi - slit mask spectroscopic follow - up on a moderate - to - high redshift subset of ten of these revealed eight clusters with redshifts as high as @xmath7 ( blanton et al .",

    "in other words , the combination of radio and optical data gives us a very clear indication for the presence , or lack of , a cluster , as confirmed with x - ray observations .    in order to identify high-@xmath11 candidates",
    ", we obtained @xmath12-band images of fields surrounding bent doubles that were blank to the limit of the digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "some of these had no optical identifications even down to the limit of our images ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we then performed near - infrared ( nir ) observations at the positions of these sources in hopes of uncovering very red , high-@xmath11 cluster galaxies .",
    "nir observations have been successful in the past in identifying high-@xmath11 clusters .",
    "stanford et al .",

    "recently , gladders & yee ( 2000 ) have performed a high - redshift cluster search by using optical and nir photometry and identifying clusters by their `` red sequence , '' or clustering on a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "chapman et al .  ( 2000 ) have used a combination of radio observations with optical and nir photometry to identify likely clusters at redshifts greater than 0.8 .",
    "here we present optical and nir observations taken at the position of the bent - double radio source , bd1137 + 3000 .",
    "a combination of imaging and spectroscopy confirms that this source is located in a distant cluster of galaxies with a redshift @xmath16 .",
    "we assume @xmath17 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 throughout .",
    "the radio source is detected in the _ first _ survey as a three component object , including a core and two lobes ( first j113733.6 + 300009 , first j113734.0 + 300002 , and first j113732.8 + 300003 ) .",

    "the southwest lobe brightens approximately halfway between the core and the edge of the lobe , bends at this bright area , and then fades toward the edge of the lobe ( typical of an fr i source ) .",
    "we expect that there is additional extended emission related to the source that is not seen because ( 1 ) there is surface brightness dimming @xmath24 and ( 2 ) it is resolved out by the high resolution of the _ first _ images . the flux density measured from the low - resolution nrao vla sky survey ( _ nvss _ ; condon et al .",
    "1997 ) , which resolves out less extended emission , 9.8 mjy , is slightly higher than the _ first _ value . using the _ nvss _ flux density value , and assuming @xmath25 with @xmath26 , the radio power of the source at 1440 mhz is @xmath27 w hz@xmath2 .",
    "this power is slightly below the fr i / ii break for radio galaxies ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) , and is typical of the class of bent double radio sources known as wide - angle tails ( wats ; odonoghue et al .",

    "optical data taken in the r - band at the kpno 2.1 m under partly cloudy conditions on ut 6 april 1997 revealed no identification for the radio galaxy to a limit of @xmath30 .",
    "this motivated us to observe the object in the nir , and later to reobserve it to deeper limits in the optical under photometric conditions .",
    "bd1137 + 30 was observed with irim at the kpno 2.1 m on ut 25 and 26 may 1997 ; the image scale was @xmath31/pixel .",
    "observations were taken in a 16-point grid pattern .",
    "the total exposure in the @xmath32-band was 64 minutes ( 64 frames of 4@xmath3315 s coadds ) , and that in the @xmath34-band was 32 minutes ( 16 frames of 4@xmath3330 s coadds ) .",
    "the seeing was approximately @xmath35 for the @xmath34-band image and @xmath36 for the @xmath32-band image .",
    "a non - linearity correction was applied to the data to account for the changing response of the instrument when high fluxes are encountered .",
    "the correction was kindly provided by f. r. chromey , derived from a non - linearity sequence taken the night immediately following our run , and amounted to a 3.3% correction at 30,000 counts .",
    "the data were corrected for the effects of dark current and flat fields using iraf .",
    "the flat fields were constructed for each band by median combining the dithered target images and rejecting the objects contained therein .",
    "these types of flats were superior to dome flats ( which we also constructed ) .",
    "the images were then processed with the iraf contributed package dimsum .",

    ", a few bad frames were identified and rejected , leaving us with a total of 30 min in the @xmath34-band and 56 min in the @xmath32-band .",

    "the error in the nir magnitudes , estimated from the difference in the zero point derived for the two nights , is 0.1 mag .",
    "aperture magnitudes were measured for objects in the target field . to assure that we were measuring the same physical aperture in each band , as well as to make the analysis more straightforward , adjustments were made to the final @xmath12 , @xmath34 , and @xmath32 images .",
    "they were all scaled to have the same pixel scale ( @xmath39/pix ) and the same orientation ( n up , e to the left ) .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath34 images were smoothed with a gaussian to match the seeing in the @xmath32-band image ( the worst of the three , with 1@xmath41 ) .",
    "we then used focas to measure magnitudes within an aperture with a diameter equal to 2@xmath33fwhm ( 3@xmath42 = 6.8 pixels ) .",
    "this is close to a total magnitude and will measure the same part of the galaxy in each of the bands . at @xmath16 ( see  [ sec : spect ] ) , this aperture corresponds to 27 kpc for our assumed cosmology .",
    "the detection limit was 2.5@xmath43 above sky and the minimum area was 12 pixels@xmath8 = 2.9 arcsec@xmath8 ( the square of the fwhm ) .",
    "the sky was calculated by taking the average pixel value in a square annulus ( default width 3 pixels ) some buffer distance ( default 2 pixels ) away from the edge of the objects last isophotes . a small difference in the sky value had a very significant effect on faint objects . to assure that we were nt including galaxy light in the sky subtraction , since many of the galaxies are very close together",
    ", we increased the buffer distance until the change in distance no longer affected the measured aperture magnitude ( i.e. , the sky value was no longer changing ) .",
    "we used a buffer of 15 pixels in @xmath12 and 20 pixels in @xmath34 and @xmath32 .",
    "the aperture magnitudes , measured as described above , for the radio source counterpart are 22.90@xmath44 , 19.46@xmath45 , and 17.78@xmath45 , in @xmath12 , @xmath34 , and @xmath32 , respectively .",

    "the absolute magnitude of the host galaxy is @xmath51 , assuming no evolution , a redshift @xmath16 ( see  [ sec : spect ] ) , and a @xmath32-correction from coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 ) .",

    "color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) were constructed for objects in the entire 15.6 arcmin@xmath8 field as well as for only the objects found within a @xmath52 radius aperture ( 480 kpc at @xmath0 , see  [ sec : spect ] ) from the radio source .",
    "no separation was made between stars and galaxies ( all were included ) . at magnitudes close to that of the radio source ,",
