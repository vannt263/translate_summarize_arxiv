    "transport in systems with many particles ( such as gases and liquids ) undergoing very frequent inter - particle collisions has been studied for more than two centuries and is described by the theory of hydrodynamics  @xcite . in the hydrodynamic regime , transport is described by  @xcite three non - linear partial - differential equations  the continuity , navier - stokes , and energy - transport equations  reflecting the conservation of mass , momentum and energy , respectively .",
    "the navier - stokes equation contains two transport coefficients  @xcite : the shear viscosity , @xmath0 , which describes friction between adjacent layers of fluid moving with different velocities , and the bulk viscosity , @xmath1 , which describes dissipation arising in a liquid due to homogeneous compression - like deformations .",
    "the energy transport equation contains the thermal conductivity @xmath2 , which describes dissipative heat flow between regions with different temperatures .",
    "these coefficients quantify the tendency of the liquid to restore a homogeneous state in response to a velocity or thermal gradient : they therefore control the magnitude of non - local contributions to the linear - response functions of the liquid",
    ".    viscous flow of dilute classical gases attracted the attention of maxwell , who theoretically discovered  @xcite a puzzling property of the shear viscosity of a dilute gas . using a molecular approach  @xcite",
    ", he found that the shear viscosity of a dilute gas is independent of density @xmath3 ( and depends on temperature @xmath4 according to @xmath5 ) , a counterintuitive result that he felt needed immediate experimental testing  @xcite .",
    "the importance of @xmath0 in the hydrodynamic behavior of dilute gases and liquids stems from the fact that this parameter controls the term of the navier - stokes equation that opposes turbulent flow  @xcite .",
    "recent years have witnessed a tremendous interdisciplinary interest in the hydrodynamic flow of strongly interacting quantum fluids .",
    "this interest was sparked by a series of results  @xcite , which were obtained via the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence , for the shear viscosity of a large class of strongly interacting thermal quantum field theories .",
    "these efforts culminated in 2005 when it was conjectured  @xcite that all quantum fluids obey the following universal lower bound : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the entropy density .",
    "note that this bound does not contain the speed of light , thereby explaining why the conjecture was extended also to non - relativistic quantum field theories .",
    "fluids that saturate this bound have been dubbed  nearly perfect fluids \" ( npfs )  @xcite , i.e.  fluids that dissipate the smallest possible amount of energy and satisfy the laws of hydrodynamics at distances as short as the inter - particle spacing . currently , two laboratory systems come closest to saturating the ads / cft bound : i ) the quark - gluon plasma  @xcite , which is created at brookhaven s relativistic heavy ion collider and at cern s large hadron collider by bashing heavy ( e.g.  gold and lead ) ions together and ii ) ultracold atomic fermi gases  @xcite ( such as @xmath8 ) close to a feshbach resonance .",
    "although mathematical counterexamples have appeared in the literature  @xcite , there are no known experimental violations of the ads / cft bound .",
    "the present work is motivated by the following questions : do electron liquids display hydrodynamic behavior ?",
    "if so , how can it be experimentally proven that the electron system has entered the hydrodynamic transport regime ?",
    "once in the hydrodynamic regime , how can the shear viscosity of an electron liquid be measured in a solid - state device ?",
    "can an electron liquid in a solid - state device be a npf ?    hydrodynamics has been used for a long time to describe transport of electrons in solid - state devices  @xcite . however , since the ( bloch ) momentum of an electron in a solid is a poorly conserved quantity due to collisions against impurities , phonons , and structural defects in the crystal , experimental signatures of hydrodynamic electron flow are expected only in ultra - clean crystals , at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "second , electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions need to be sufficiently strong to ensure that the mean free path @xmath9 for e - e collisions is the shortest length scale in the problem , i.e.  @xmath10 . here",
    ", @xmath11 is the fermi velocity , @xmath12 is the mean free path for momentum - non - conserving collisions , @xmath13 is the sample size , and @xmath14 the frequency of the external perturbation .",
    "unfortunately , the low - temperature requirement ( needed to mitigate the breakdown of momentum conservation in a solid - state environment ) and the strong e - e interaction requirement are conflicting : at low temperatures , where @xmath12 is large , the mean free path @xmath9 for e - e collisions is also very large due to pauli blocking . indeed , normal fermi liquids at low temperatures  @xcite display very large values of @xmath9 , i.e.  @xmath15 for temperatures @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the fermi temperature .",
    "( in two spatial dimensions there is a very well known  @xcite logarithmic correction that has been dropped . ) these severe restrictions , imposed by a rigid fermi surface on the phase space for two - body e - e collisions , can be relieved by increasing temperature .",
    "indeed , @xmath9 quickly decreases for increasing @xmath4 .",
    "short e - e mean free paths therefore require to operate at sufficiently elevated temperatures . at such temperatures ,",
    "strong scattering of electrons against optical phonons ( e.g.  in polar cystals such as gaas ) often leads to the unwanted inequality @xmath18 .",
    "realizing hydrodynamic flow at `` high '' temperatures therefore requires not only ultra - clean crystals but also crystals where electron - phonon coupling is extremely weak .",
    "we note that it is in principle easier to reach the hydrodynamic transport regime in non - polar crystals such as graphene , where the dominating mechanism at large temperatures is scattering of electrons against acoustic phonons . in this case",
    "@xmath12 decays as @xmath19 , i.e.  slower than @xmath9 .    for these reasons ,",
    "evidence of hydrodynamic transport in solid - state devices is , to the best of our knowledge , limited to early work carried out by molenkamp and de jong  @xcite in electrostatically defined wires in gaas / algaas heterostructures .",
    "these authors measured a non - monotonic dependence of the four - point longitudinal resistivity @xmath20 on the electronic temperature @xmath4 , which is increased above the lattice temperature by using a large dc heating current .",
    "the decrease of @xmath20 with increasing temperature above a certain value of @xmath4 was attributed to e - e collisions  @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called `` gurzhi effect '' and will be discussed extensively in this article .",
    "more recently , indirect evidence of hydrodynamic flow comes from an explanation  @xcite of coulomb drag between two neutral graphene sheets  @xcite , which differs from that offered by the authors of ref .  .",
    "recent experimental progress  @xcite , however , has made it possible to fabricate samples with ultra - high carrier transport mobilities _ up to room temperature_. these are graphene sheets encapsulated between thin hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) slabs , which display ultra - high mobilities reaching @xmath21 in a wide range of temperatures up to room temperature .",
    "these values can be achieved in gaas / algaas heterostructures only below @xmath22 because of polar phonon scattering  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the finite electron mass and moderate doping required to achieve high mobilities limits the fermi energy to values below a few tens of mev , which makes the fermi level smearing important even at liquid nitrogen temperatures .",
    "encapsulated samples  @xcite are special because electrons roaming in graphene suffer very weak scattering against acoustic phonons  @xcite and because hbn provides an exceptionally clean and flat dielectric environment for graphene  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , microscopic calculations based on many - body diagrammatic perturbation theory  @xcite indicate that the e - e mean free path @xmath9 in graphene is shorter than @xmath23 in a wide range of carrier densities and temperatures @xmath24 .",
    "we therefore conclude that hbn / graphene / hbn stacks are ideal samples where the long - sought hydrodynamic regime can be unveiled and explored .",
    "indeed , recent non - local transport measurements  @xcite carried out in high - quality encapsulated single - layer ( slg ) and bilayer ( blg ) graphene samples have demonstrated that this is the case .",
    "the authors of ref .   have reported evidence of hydrodynamic transport , showing that doped graphene exhibits an anomalous ( negative ) voltage drop near current injection points , which has been attributed to the formation of whirlpools in the electron flow . from measurements of non - local signals ,",
    "bandurin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite extracted the viscosity of graphene s electron liquid and found it to be in quantitative agreement with many - body theory calculations  @xcite .    in this article , we present a fully - analytical theoretical study of non - local dc transport in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron liquid in a graphene sheet in the hydrodynamic regime . in sect .",

    "[ sect : summary ] we present a summary of our main results and offer some perspectives .",
    "we remark that , in the present work , we focus only on doped slg and blg sheets , where the applicability of the fermi - liquid theory is granted .",

    "the fermi surface shrinks to a point and fermi liquid theory is not applicable . for example , the authors of ref .",
    "have found that the ratio @xmath25 for the 2d electron liquid in a graphene sheet at the charge neutrality point comes close to saturating the ads / cft bound . in nearly neutral semimetals",
    "@xmath9 is also short due to frequent collisions between thermally excited carriers ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "<S> motivated by recent experimental progress in preparing encapsulated graphene sheets with ultra - high mobilities up to room temperature , we present a theoretical study of dc transport in doped graphene in the hydrodynamic regime . by using the continuity and navier - stokes equations , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate analytically that measurements of non - local resistances in multi - terminal hall bar devices can be used to extract the hydrodynamic shear viscosity of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron liquid in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how to probe the viscosity - dominated hydrodynamic transport regime by scanning probe potentiometry and magnetometry . </S>",
    "<S> our approach enables measurements of the viscosity of any 2d electron liquid in the hydrodynamic transport regime . </S>"
