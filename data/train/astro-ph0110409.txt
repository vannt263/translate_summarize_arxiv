    "the sky background in each image was determined through the statistical analysis of a @xmath29 clipping of the average background value in several regions in each of the images .",
    "the optical broadband images show an elliptical galaxy with blobs and filaments ( fig . 1 and 2 ) . both the _ v _ and _",
    "r _ images show these structures , and some are also present in the ramp image .",
    "we have named the most prominent of these structures as a , b , c , d and e ( fig .",
    "3 ) . to compare with radio data , we superimposed a 8.4 ghz radio map from the observations of leahy ( 1999 ) in fig .",
    "the total extension of the radio structure is @xmath30 ( from lobe to lobe ) , larger that the size of these hst images .",
    "the object named a is bright and extended , and is located @xmath31 from the nucleus ( p.a .",
    "@xmath32 ) , and has the same shape in all filters .",
    "the flux in the narrow - filter implies a large emission of [ o  iii]@xmath0 emission .",
    "the structure named b , is located @xmath33 away from the nucleus at p.a .",
    "@xmath34 , and is similar in shape to structure a albeit fainter . both of these structures ( a and b ) seem to be connected with the galaxy by very faint filaments .    the object named c is located to the west at a separation of @xmath35 from the nucleus at p.a .",
    "@xmath36 . a filament appears to connected it directly to the center of the galaxy . superimposed over this line at @xmath28 from the nucleus",
    ", there is another blob ( c ) .",
    "the filament just described and those associated with blobs a and b , can be interpreted as the edges of a biconic structure with an opening angle of @xmath37 .",
    "this kind of morphology has been found to be common in a variety of active galaxies ranging from nearby spirals ( for example ngc 1068 , evans et al .",
    "1991 ; ngc 5728 , wilson et al .",
    "1993 ) to powerful 3cr objects ( e.g. 3c  299 feinstein et al .",
    "the southern radio - jet is located in the middle of this bi - conical structure .",
    "the structure d is located inside the elliptical profile of the galaxy , ne of the nucleus . after the subtraction of a @xmath38 profile ( using the iraf / stsdas task _ ellipse _ ) from the image , a filamentary link emerges connecting d to the galaxy nucleus ( see fig . 1 . ) .",
    "this structure seems not to be as large as the others and is very difficult to measure in the broad - band images because of the steep shape of the elliptical galaxy profile .",
    "this structure is also evident in the [ o  iii]@xmath0 image , but as for the broad - band data , it is not possible to measure its flux reliably .    the structure named e , at @xmath39 from the nucleus at p.a .",
    "@xmath40 , is not present in the narrow - band filter .",
    "its profile is compact and steep , showing all the typical characteristics of a field galaxy with a redshift different from that of 3c 244.1 .",
    "we have carried out photometry of the structures surrounding 3c  244.1 using the iraf task _ polyphot _ ( from the noao apphot package ) .",
    "this iraf task computes the magnitude of an object in an image inside a polygonal aperture .",
    "the sky background is also computed and subtracted and the errors are calculated . to measure the bulk of the emission for each structure a polygon that closely matches the shape of the region was careful chosen .",
    "the same polygons were used on all images from the different filters to make the data comparable between these filters . however , for the _ v _ filter , where the signal is lower , some of these structures were difficult to measure above the background noise .",
    "table 2 shows the result of the photometry using the polygonal measurement technique and the subsequent calibration . for the broad - bands filters ,",
    "the data were calibrated using the inverse sensitivity ( photflam ) and the filter width ( see wide field and planetary camera instrument handbook - biretta , 1996 ) .",
    "for the fr680n filter , the calibration was done using the iraf / stsdas _ synphot _ , and checked with the wfpc2 exposure time calculator ( etc ) .",
    "the flux observed at this filter , basically the flux of the [ o  iii]@xmath0 line , was corrected by a small contamination ( @xmath41% ) of the [ o  iii]@xmath42 line ( asumming that the flux of the [ o  iii]@xmath0 line is 2.88 times the [ o  iii]@xmath42 flux ) .",
    "this correction was calculated by computing the central wavelength at the position on the ccd , and assuming that the filter is gaussian , centered at that wavelength with a fwhm of 1.3% ( value obtained from the etc ) of this central wavelength .",
    "columns 2 , 3 and 4 of table 2 are the results of these calibrations .    from fig .",
    "1 , structures a and b are very close the jet flow , so the first attempt was to test if these objects were optical synchrotron knots on the radio jet .",
    "so we fit a power law to flux from the broad band filters f555w and f702w .",
    "if the main source of flux is synchrotron radiation , the flux must follow a power law with an exponent in the range -0.5 to -1.5 . to make the test as more accurately as we can , we used the task _ calcphot - synphot _",
    "( from the synphot / stsdas iraf package ) to integrate the power law under a better simulation of each filter .",
    "we found that the observed flux is not a power law and the best fit is a flat distribution with a null slope .",
    "so , we conclude that the observed flux is inconsistent with power - law distributions of optical synchrotron radiation .    from the the broad band filters",
    ", we can estimated the ( v - i ) colors of the elliptical host galaxy , a and b regions .",
    "colors of the other structures can not be measured unless we have a better modeling of the underline galaxy flux , for which we need deeper observations and better spatial resolution .",
    "objects a and b are far away from the elliptical profile and are clearly not contaminated . for the elliptical galaxy",
    "we obtain ( v - i)=1.2 @xmath430.3 which is close to the value predicted by rnnback et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for an elliptical galaxy at the redshift of 3c 244.1 ( z=0.428 ) meanwhile the objects a and b , seems to be bluer with values -0.2 @xmath43 0.2 and -0.6 @xmath43 0.5 respectively .    both structures a and b , given the large flux in the narrow ramp filter , are obviously at the 3c 244.1 redshift .",
    "also both show the same morphology shape as the broad - band images . since the _ r _",
    "filter data also includes the flux of h@xmath14 , [ o iii]@xmath15 , he  ii@xmath16 , h@xmath17 , [ o iii]@xmath184959,5007 and [ n  i]@xmath19 emission lines , the total flux measured in this broad band must be larger than the ramp filter which only includes [ o  iii]@xmath0 .",
    "the fact that they are so similar can be explained if we assume than the flux originates in a pure emission line region , without any significant continuum contribution .",
    "as the narrow - band filter data shows , there is a large amount of flux in the emission line [ o  iii]@xmath0 .",
    "thus it is very reasonable to suggest that the structures a and b are extended narrow line regions ( enlr ) .",
    "the enlr have been found to be associated with a wide variety of agn , from seyfert 2 to radio galaxies .",
    "column 5 ( table 2 ) shows the flux calibration of the broad - band _ r _ filter assuming that all the flux is from a source that has a spectrum dominated by bright emission lines .",
    "the shape of the f702w filter is practically flat ( see wide field and planetary camera 2 instrument handbook , page 217 ) , and so it is easy to compute the calibration of the flux of all the lines by calculating the total flux for only one emission line ( that accounts for all the line emission flux ) . to make this calculation , the etc was used and the quantum efficiencies ( system + filter + ccd , hereafter qt ) for each wavelength of the conspicuous emission lines included in the _ r _ filter band were computed .",
    "table 3 shows the results of this calculation and confirm that all these emission lines are practically attenuated by similar amounts .",
    "therefore we used h@xmath17 as an equivalent line ( i.e. a line that has all the flux of all the lines included in the filter ) for the calibration .",
    "the error of this procedure is extremely small .",
    "a key question is to identify the mechanism responsible for the ionization of these structures and filaments .",
    "the most likely mechanisms are  : photoionization by the agn , photoionization by the agn with matter - bounded clouds and shock - ionization by the radio jet .",
    "we discuss each of these mechanism in detail .",
    "this mechanism assumes that the uv flux produced by the agn s nuclear source photoionizes the line emission region .",
    "the physical status of the gas at any place can be described with the ionizing parameter ( @xmath3 ) , which considers the dilution of the uv photons as the distance from the nucleus increases . for regions",
    "a and b , it is very unlikely that the agn is the only source of photons because the large distances . to account for this scenario ,",
    "some reference numbers of the total photon budget can be calculated .",
    "rawlings et al . ( 1989 ) performed spectroscopy of the nuclear zone of 3c  244.1 and show a relation of [ o iii]@xmath0 /h@xmath44 . using the results of ferland and netzer ( 1983 ) , which assume that the main source of photoionization continuum is a power law ( @xmath45 and that the gas has a density of @xmath46 , they calculate several line emission ratios .",
    "using these results , it is straightforward to compute the ionization parameter ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this leads @xmath47 for solar abundances and @xmath48 for subsolar abundances .",
    "this spectrum covers only light coming from the nuclear zone that is observed in the narrow band filter ( regions a and b are not included in this spectrum ) , so it is possible to calculate the total uv photon emission of the nucleus . because @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be estimated from the wfpc2 emission line image , this gives @xmath51 photons sec@xmath9 for solar abundances and @xmath52 photons sec@xmath9 for sub - solar abundances . due to the large distances , these two values ( for each this different abundances ) are not enough to ionize the blobs a and b. therefore , we conclude that direct photoionization by the nucleus is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism responsible for the observed enlr emission .",
    "this idea was developed by binette et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in order to explain the discrepant high ionization line ratios and high electron temperatures observed in many active galaxies .",
    "these models are based on a parameter @xmath53 which is the solid angle covered by the `` matter - bounded '' component relative to that covered by the `` ionization - bounded''component . in another paper , binette et al .",
    "( 1997 ) refined their models . taking into account the possibility of having a larger @xmath3 parameter , they derived three models with values of @xmath54 , 0.05 , 0.02 and a density @xmath55 @xmath56 for the `` matter bounded '' clouds , which are exposed to ionization radiation from the agn .    as we only have one line and the integrated total flux of several lines from the _ r _ filter , we computed the flux ratio @xmath57/[o iii]@xmath0 noting that the bulk of the r filter flux is the sum of h@xmath14 , [ o  iii]@xmath15 , he  ii@xmath16 , h@xmath17 , [ o  iii]@xmath184959,5007 and [ n  i]@xmath19 fluxes .",
    "note that the contribution from the stellar host galaxy is not significant at the location of the blobs .",
    "the line ratio can be derived from table  2 and are @xmath58 for structure a and @xmath59 for structure b.    we computed @xmath60 ( the ratio of lines include in the _ r _ filter to [ o  iii]@xmath0 ) for the results of mixed models of the papers mentioned above .",
    "table  4 shows these results of @xmath60 as a function of the @xmath53 parameter for the model of binette et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and models h , m , l of ( binette et al . 1997 ) .",
    "models m and l seem to fit the observed @xmath60 for structures a and b , for @xmath61 and 0.34 for each object . but both of them have the same problem that we have discuss for the first case of photoionization by the agn , @xmath62 for model m and @xmath63 for model l , values that imply a very high @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) due to the distances to the galaxy nucleus .",
    "this calculation makes the mixed models very unlikely .",
    "fig 1 shows that the enlr structures a and b are located close to the edges of the radio - jet and it is possible that there is an interaction between the jet and these regions .",
    "it is important to study whether there is a physical relationship between the radio - jet and the optical line emission .",
    "taylor et al .",
    "( 1992 ) proposed that fast bowshocks resulting from the interaction of the radio jet and the ism were the source of ionizing photons of the emission - line gas in a number of sources .",
    "capetti et al .",
    "( 1995a , 1995b , 1996 , 1997 ) and winge et al .",
    "( 1997 ) were the first to show that this mechanism best explains the optical emission in the nlr in nearby seyfert galaxies ( mrk 3 , mrk 6 , mrk 573 , ngc 1068 , ngc 4151 and ngc 7319 ) .",
    "recently , this work has been confirmed by aoki et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and kukula et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in the case of the powerful radio galaxies of the 3cr catalogue ,",
    "feinstein et al . ( 1999 ) showed that this interaction also occurs in 3c  299 , where clearly the ne radio - jet and the enlr have similar morphologies , and where there is further evidence of this interaction from the values of the different emission - line ratios and the evolution of the line ratio [ o  ii]@xmath2/[o  iii]@xmath0 , as an estimator of the changes of @xmath3 , over the region .",
    "dopita & sutherland ( 1995a , b ) have modeled in detail the ionization of the enlr due to shocks . in one scenario , which has been shown to work for seyfert galaxies , the radio jet interacts with the local interstellar medium and shocks the gas . in this scenario ,",
    "the hot post - shock plasma gas produces photons that can diffuse upstream and downstream of the jet .",
    "photons diffusing upstream can encounter the preshocked gas and produce an extensive precursor hii region , while those traveling downstream will influence the ionization and temperature structure of the recombination of the shock .    to check the validity of this interpretation",
    ", we use the line diagnostic test of dopita & sutherland ( 1995b ) .",
    "we applied the same procedure as the case above and use the flux ratio @xmath57/[o  iii]@xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", we can compute the value of this ratio for emission lines arising in a shocked enlr . using table 1 of dopita & sutherland ( 1995b )",
    "we calculated the total integrated flux for the lines involved and the ratio to [ o  iii]@xmath0 flux as  :    @xmath66\\lambda 5007\\ qt_{[o iii]\\lambda 5007 } } $ ]    where _ i _ represents each of the lines mentioned above and @xmath67 their respective flux .",
    "table  5 shows the results of this computation , for shock speeds of 100 , 150 , 200 and 500 km sec@xmath9 , with and without a precursor h  ii region . from this table ,",
    "the values observed for structures a ( @xmath58 ) and b ( @xmath59 ) are easily explained with shock models of @xmath68  km sec@xmath9 .",
    "we conclude that shock interactions between the expanding jet and the local denser medium are responsible for the observed enlr emission in 3c 244.1",
    "we have shown that radio galaxy 3c 244.1 has a filamentary structure and some blobs bright in emission line ( [ o  iii]@xmath0 ) . to the south",
    ", this structure seems to be an emission - line cone with an opening angle of @xmath37 ( from p.a .",
    "@xmath32 to p.a @xmath36 ) .",
    "the radio - jet is located at the center of this cone ( p.a .",
    "@xmath5 ) . the two brighter blobs ( named a and b ) are likely part of the enlr ( by comparing the flux between broad - band and narrow - band ) , similar to those associated with agns . these structures are larger and located far away from the nucleus ( @xmath31 ) . to the north more of these structures were found , but near and associated with the nucleus .",
    "we tested several scenarios to explain the source of energy for the emission lines observed and we found that the direct photoionization by the agn can only be possible if an unlikely large amount of uv photons is provided by agn .",
    "the same is true in more sophisticated mixed medium models ( binette et al .",
    "1996,1997 ) .",
    "the observations seem to fit well the behavior of a model material shocked by the radio jet ( dopita et al .",
    "a shock velocity of 200 km sec@xmath9 can explain the ratio of the lines included in the _ r_-band filter to the [ o  iii]@xmath0 line - emission .",
    "therefore , from the morphology ( location of the radio - jet ) and these physical arguments ( the flux measured is consistent with emission from shocked gas ) , we conclude that the enlr structures of 3c 244.1 are the result of the interaction of the radio jet with ism gas .                                                                              c c c c f702w & broad band & 300 & 1994 apr 17 + f702w & broad band & 300 & 1995 may 28 + fr680n & [ o  iii]@xmath0 & 300 & 1995 nov 13 + fr680n & [ o  iii]@xmath0 & 300 & 1995 nov 13 + f555w & broad band & 300 & 1996 sep 7 + f555w & broad band & 300 & 1996 sep 7 +    c r r r r a & 17.26 @xmath43 1.37 & 20.57 @xmath43 2.69 & 9.36 @xmath43 1.24 & 24.12 @xmath43 1.91 + b & 5.25 @xmath43 0.82 & 5.04 @xmath43 1.62 & 3.58 @xmath43 0.77 & 7.34 @xmath43 1.14 + c & 2.6 @xmath43 0.59 & & & 3.62 @xmath43 0.83 + c & 2.3 @xmath43 0.52 & & & 3.24 @xmath43 0.74 +    c c h@xmath14 & 0.133 + @xmath69\\lambda4363 $ ] & 0.139 + @xmath70\\lambda4686 $ ] & 0.132 + h@xmath17 & 0.124 + @xmath69\\lambda4959 $ ] & 0.113 + @xmath69\\lambda5007 $ ] & 0.112 + @xmath71\\lambda5199 $ ] & 0.092 +",
