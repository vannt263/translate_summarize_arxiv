    "collective electronic excitations ( excitons ) have been a matter of research since their introduction by frenkel in 1931 @xcite .",
    "frenkel excitons are of importance for fundamental physics , as they explain various electrical and optical properties in molecular crystals , e.g. in organic and noble atom crystals @xcite .",
    "these type of excitations have been extensively investigated and found applications for optoelectronic devices @xcite .",
    "the mechanism behind their appearance is through the delocalization of electronic excitations among the crystal atoms or molecules via electrostatic interactions , mainly resonant dipole - dipole interactions , and in exploiting the lattice symmetry .",
    "such coherent states can appear spontaneously among electronic states of a huge number of atoms without the aid of external fields .",
    "just to mention that coherence among electronic states inside the same atom implies external laser fields , as for electromagnetic induced transparency and population trapping @xcite .",
    "the progress in the fabrication of optical lattices provides artificial crystals with controllable parameters @xcite , which are adopted to simulate a wide range of complex condensed matter models and present a deep understanding of puzzling solid state effects @xcite . of importance here",
    "is ultracold atoms in optical lattices at the mott insulator phase with one atom per site , which have been proposed for simulating frenkel excitons and unveiled physical phenomena that are masked by thermal excitations and impurities in solid crystals @xcite .    on the other hand optical lattices",
    "have been introduced as active material for cavity qed @xcite .",
    "it was shown that electronic excitations and cavity photons in the strong coupling regime are naturally mixed to form polaritons as the system collective excitations @xcite .",
    "several configurations of optical lattices within a cavity have been suggested with diverse dimensionality and geometry @xcite .",
    "of special interest is that of a one dimensional optical lattice formed by a nanophotonic waveguide @xcite , which was realized for cesium atoms in using tapered nanofibers @xcite . the optical lattice is localized outside and parallel to the nanofiber by evanescent fields of counter propagating colored fiber beams .",
    "the atomic lattice can be directly interrogated by a resonant beam that sent through the fiber and observed via linear optical spectra @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we address an optical super - lattice with two sites per unit cell and that includes one atom per site , where the distance between the two on cell atoms is taken to be smaller than the distance between the centers of two neighbor unit cells .",
    "this configuration gives rise to symmetric and antisymmetric entangled states , in which an electronic excitation can be delocalized among the two atoms inside the same unit cell .",
    "the symmetric states are bright and superradiant with damping rate of twice that of a single excited atoms . while the antisymmetric states are dark with zero damping rate and decouple to the light @xcite .",
    "it is a big challenge to excite dark states in an efficient and controllable way . in localizing the super - lattice parallel to a nanophotonic waveguide at a fixed distance , only the symmetric excitons coherently couple to the fiber photons in order to form one dimensional polaritons .",
    "excitons in an extended system behave as bosons , but then they acquire a mechanism that forbids double excitations at the same atom @xcite . in previous work we presented a bosonization procedure that transform two - level atoms into bosons with additional kinematic interactions that forbid two excitations from being localized on the same atom , and which found to be a good approximation at low intensity of excitations @xcite . here",
    "we apply such a procedure to optical super - lattices , and we interestingly show that kinematic interactions can couple symmetric and antisymmetric states .",
    "we exploit this mechanism as a controllable mean for exciting dark excitons . in order to achieve our goal",
    "we proposed a pump - probe experiment , where two pumped polaritons with momentum @xmath0 can be scattering into two dark excitons of momenta @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this parametric amplification of dark states is induced by a probe field at either @xmath1 or @xmath2 momenta , and subjected to conservation of energy .",
    "the scattering of two polaritons into a state of two excited atoms in the same unit cell can be excluded due to conservation of energy . in the frame of bogoliubov",
    "mean field theory the dark exciton pairs are strongly correlated and can be represented by bogolon excitations that termed here bogolon - excitons @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce dark and bright excitons into an optical super - lattice . an atomic super - lattice strongly coupled to a nanophotonic waveguide is presented in section 3 by using the language of polaritons .",
    "kinematic interactions are derived in section 4 with emphasize on the symmetric - antisymmetric mixing .",
    "pump - probe experiments appear in section 5 where a process for exciting dark states is proposed .",
    "section 6 includes bogoliubov mean field theory with dark bogolon - excitons .",
    "a summary is given in section 7 .",
    "we consider a system of one - dimensional optical lattice with a basis of two sites ( super - lattice ) .",
    "namely , we have a lattice with unit cell of two trapping minima , as seen in figure ( 1 ) .",

    "we exploit the result of the previous section to suggest kinematic interactions as a mechanism for significantly exciting such dark states . the above kinematic hamiltonian results in mixing interactions that allow scattering among bright polaritons and dark excitons .",
    "we exploit the kinematic scattering of polaritons into dark excitons as a mechanism for populating the dark states . in order to achieve this task in a controllable way we present the following scenario that implies two external sources in pump - probe experiment @xcite .",
    "an external pump is used to strongly excite polaritons with a fixed wave number , say @xmath0 .",

    "this probe field is needed in order to stimulate scattering of bright polaritons into these dark states .",
    "therefore , for the lower branch we consider only polaritons with a fixed wave number @xmath0 . the upper polariton branch is excluded due to conservation of energy . as two polaritons of wave number",
    "@xmath0 can scatter into two dark excitons , the conservation of momentum implies two dark excitons with momenta @xmath153 and @xmath154 . due to the fact that dark excitons are dispersion - less and on - site localized , any pair of dark states is allowed in the scattering with wave numbers @xmath153 and @xmath154 . here",

    "in the present paper we showed how coherent states of electronic excitations are spontaneously formed only through resonant dipole - dipole interactions and in exploiting the lattice symmetry , without the aid of additional external fields .",
    "the study is presented for an optical super - lattice with two atoms per unit cell in which dark and bright excitons appear . in localizing the one dimensional atomic super - lattice parallel to a nanophotonic waveguide the bright excitons",
    "are strongly coupled to the waveguide photons to form polaritons as the system natural collective excitations .",
    "excitons behave as bosons at low intensity of excitations , but as the atomic transitions are of two - level systems a mechanism is required to forbid two excitations from being localized on the same atom .",
    "a bosonization procedure from two - level systems into bosons was suggested by us in other work that excludes double excitation at the same atom by including kinematic interactions among excitons . in adopting this procedure for the present atomic super - lattice the kinematic interactions interestingly couple dark and bright excitons .",
    "we used the kinematic interactions in order to excite dark excitons in an efficient and controllable way .",
    "we suggested a pump - probe experiment in which two pumped polaritons of a given momentum @xmath0 can be scattered into two dark excitons of momenta @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where the process is induced by a probe field .",
    "the two dark excitons are found to be strongly correlated and can be represented as dark bogolon - excitons .",
    "bogolon - excitons can be implemented as qubits for quantum information processing , and their long life - time allow them to serve as memory states .",
    "the above parametric amplification scenario can be used to write into these states , and the addition of asymmetry into the system can be used to read out . furthermore , achieving a fixed population of dark bogolon - excitons in a controllable way is an important step toward achieving the long awaited bec of excitons .    the consideration in the present paper event hough presented for atomic super - lattice can be also realized for a one dimensional organic crystal with two molecules per unit cell . here",
    "one get an anisotropic crystal and the orientation of the molecules relative to the axis gives rise to two davydov exciton branches , in which both can be bright or one bright and the other dark .",
    "this fact can enrich the present physical properties as the polarization direction provides an extra degree of freedom ."
