    "random walks on graphs serve as the basis of algorithms for solving a number of problems , including 2-sat , graph connectivity , and finding satsifying assignments for boolean functions . quantum algorithms",
    "have shown promise in solving some problems faster than is possible using classical algorithms .",
    "quantum walks represent an attempt to `` quantize '' classical random walk algorithms and thereby increase their speed .",
    "quantum algorithms must be run on a quantum computer . in this kind of machine",
    ", information is represented not in terms of bits , but in terms of quantum bits , or qubits .",
    "a bit is either @xmath1 or @xmath2 and can be represented by current on or off , or by two different voltages .",
    "a qubit is a two - level quantum system , and possibilites include the spin states of an electron or the polarization states of a photon .",
    "one of the states , e.g.  spin up , corresponds to @xmath1 and the other , e.g.  spin down , corresponds to @xmath2 .",
    "the principle difference between a bit and a qubit , is that the bit is either @xmath1 or @xmath2 , while the qubit can be in a superposition of its @xmath1 state and its @xmath2 state .",
    "computers based on bits represent and process information according to the rules of classical physics , while computers based on qubits represent and process information according to the rules of quantum physics .",
    "there has been some progress in using quantum walks to construct quantum algorithms .",
    "it has recently been shown that it is possible to use a quantum walk to perform a search on the hypercube faster than can be done classically @xcite . in this problem",
    "the number of steps drops from @xmath3 , which is the number of vertices , in the classical case to @xmath4 in the quantum case .",
    "a much more dramatic improvement has recently been obtained by childs , _ et al .",
    "they constructed an oracle problem that can be solved by a quantum algorithm based on a quantum walk exponentially faster than is possible with any classical algorithm .",
    "quantum walks were introduced by y.  aharanov , l.  davidovich and n.  zagury @xcite .",
    "they considered a spin-@xmath5 particle that is shifted to the left or right depending on its spin state . since then , a number of different kinds of quantum walks have been developed .",
    "the first , the coined walk , is a discrete time walk that makes use of an auxiliary quantum system , the coin .",
    "this is necessary to make the operator that advances the walk one step unitary .",
    "this walk was originally proposed by watrous and is closlely related to the original walk discussed by aharanov @xcite .",
    "a second type of walk is the continuous time walk , due to childs , _",
    "et al_. @xcite . here",
    "the hamiltonian that is used to construct the time development transformation is taken to be proportional to the adjancency matrix of the graph .",
    "a third type of walk , based on thinking about the graph as an interferometer with optical multiports as the nodes was recenty proposed by us @xcite . in this case the walk takes place on the edges of the graph , rather than the vertices , and each edge has two states , one corresponding to traversing the edge in one direction and the other to traversing the edge in the opposite direction .",
    "it should be noted that while it is very simple to construct a quantum walk on an arbitrary graph using the second and third methods , it is much less obvious how to do so for the coined walk",
    ".    let us briefly describe the coined quantum walk . in trying to formulate a quantum walk on a graph",
    ", the most natural thing to do is to let a set of orthonormal basis states correspond to the vertices of the graph .",
    "if a particle is in the state @xmath6 , that corresponds to its being located on vertex @xmath0 .",
    "let the hilbert space spanned by these states be @xmath7 .",
    "trying to define a unitary evolution using this scheme soon leads to serious problems , as was first noted by meyer @xcite .",
    "watrous solved this problem by enlarging the hilbert space in which the quantum walk takes place .",
    "how this scheme works is most easily seen by considering the quantum walk on a line .",
    "the vertices are labelled by integers , and , in addition , there is a quantum coin , which has two states , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , corresponding to left and right , respectively , which span a two - dimensional hilbert space , @xmath10 .",
    "a basis for the hilbert space describing the entire system , @xmath11 , is given by the states @xmath12 , where @xmath0 is an integer , and @xmath13 is either @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "a step in this walk consists of applying the hadamard operator , @xmath16 , to the coin , @xmath17 and then the operator @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the shift operator , whose action is given by @xmath20 note that the evolution of the quantum state of the walk is deterministic , that is , if the initial state is @xmath21 , then the state after @xmath22 steps is just @xmath23^{m}|\\psi_{in}\\rangle$ ] . probabilities enter the picture when we try to determine where the particle is by making measurements .",
    "coined quantum walks have been studied on both the line by nayak and vishwananth @xcite and on the cycle by d.  aharanov _ et al_. @xcite .",
    "et al_. also studied a number of properties of quantum walks on general graphs .",
    "absorbing times and probabilities for walks on the line have been examined by several authors @xcite .",
    "going beyond one dimension , properties of quantum walks on two and three dimensional lattices @xcite and on the hypercube @xcite have been explored .",
    "the effects of decoherence on quantum walks have also been studied .",
    "et al_. showed how increasing amounts of decoherence turn a quantum walk into a classical random walk @xcite .",
    "kendon and tregenna found that small amounts of decoherence can speed up the convergence of the time - averaged probability distribution of a quantum walk @xcite .",
    "many aspects of quantum walks are covered in the recent and excellent review by kempe @xcite .",
    "several proposals have been made for the physical realization of quantum walks @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the ones closest in spirit to the walks studied here are the realizations that employ optical methods , either linear optical elements @xcite or cavities @xcite .",
    "the last two references show that an experimental quantum walk has , in fact , been carried out , though it was not intrepreted as such at the time @xcite .    here",
    "we wish to describe quantm walks that take place on the edges of a graph , and to study the connection between these walks and scattering theory . in order to show how scattering theory enters the picture , begin with a graph ,",
    "choose two vertices , and attach two semi - infinite lines , which we shall call tails , to it , one to each of the selected vertices .",
    "each of the half - lines is made up of vertices and edges .",
    "thus we can start the walk on one of the tails , have it progress into the original graph , and emerge onto the opposite tail .",
    "this type of arrangement allows us to define a scattering matrix , or s matrix , for the original graph , with the amplitude to get from one tail to the other being called the transmission amplitude .",
    "as we shall see properties of quantum walks starting on one tail and ending on the other can be expressed in terms of the transmission amplitude of the graph .",
    "it should be noted that scattering approaches have also proven useful in a related area , quantum graphs , which can be used to study electron transport in large molecules @xcite .",
    "the first use of scattering theory to analyze the behavior of quantum walks was done by farhi and gutmann @xcite .",
    "they studied continuous - time walks on trees , and they added tails to the trees to place the walks into a scattering - theoretic framework .",
    "they were able to place bounds on the time for a walk , starting at the root of the tree , to penetrate to one of the leaves .",
    "we begin by defining our quantum walk , and then illustrate it with an example .",
    "we then explore the relation between properties of the quantum walk and the transmission amplitude of the graph .",
    "these are then applied to an example .",
    "we define a time - reversal transformation for quantum walks and use it to explore when the transmission amplitude to go through the graph in one direction is the same as the transmission amplitude to go through it in the other direction . finally , we finish with a detailed study of the properties of the transmission and reflection amplitudes , in particular showing that they are analytic in on the unit circle and in its interior .",
    "this allows us to express the probability of starting on one tail and finishing on the other in @xmath0 steps and also the hitting time for a walk from one tail to the other very simply in terms of the transmission amplitude of the graph .",
    "the type of quantum walk that will be used throughout this paper was originally presented in @xcite . we imagine a particle on an edge of a graph ; it is this particle that will make the walk .",
    "each edge has two states , one going in one direction , the other going in the other direction , and we denote the set of oriented edges ( an edge and its direction of traversal is an oriented edge ) of the graph by @xmath24 .",
    "that is , if our edge is between the vertices @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which we shall denote as @xmath27 , it has two orthogonal states , @xmath28 , corresponding to the particle being on @xmath27 and going from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , and @xmath29 , corresponding to the particle being on @xmath27 and going from @xmath26 to @xmath25 .",
    "the collection of all of these edge states is a basis for a hilbert space , and the states of the particle making the walk lie in this space , which is @xmath30 .    now that we have our state space , we need a unitary operator that advances the walk one step .",
    "let us first illustrate how this works for a walk on the line .",
    "we shall label the vertices by the integers . in this case , the states of the system are @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "the vertices can be thought of as scattering centers .",
    "consider what happens when a particle , moving in one dimension , hits a scattering center .",
    "it has a certain amplitude to continue in the direction it was going , i.e.  to be transmitted , and an amplitude to be change its direction , i.e.  to be reflected .",
    "the scatterer has two input states , the particle can enter from either the right or the left , and two output states , the particle can leave heading either right or left .",
    "the scattering center defines a unitary transformation between the input and output states .",
    "we now need to translate this into transition rules for our quantum walk .",
    "suppose we are in the state @xmath33 .",
    "if the particle is transmitted it will be in the state @xmath34 , and if reflected in the state @xmath35 .",
    "let the transmission amplitude be @xmath36 , and the reflection amplitude be @xmath37 .",
    "we then have the transition rule @xmath38 where unitarity implies that @xmath39 .",
    "the other possibility is that the particle is incident on vertex @xmath40 from the right , that is it is in the state @xmath41 .",
    "if it is transmitted it is in the state @xmath35 , and if it is reflected , it is in the state @xmath34 .",
    "unitarity of the scattering transformation then gives us that @xmath42",
    "these rules specify our walk .    the case @xmath43 and @xmath44 corresponds to free particle propagation ; a particle in the state @xmath34 simply moves one step to the right with each time step in the walk .",
    "if @xmath45 , then there is some amplitude to move both to the right and to the left . as an example , let us consider the case when @xmath46 , and the particle starts in the state @xmath47 .",
    "the probability distribution for finding the particle on a given edge after @xmath48 steps is shown in figure 1 .",
    "first , note that this distribution look nothing like the distribution that would result from a classical random walk on a line , which would be a gaussian centered about the initial position of the particle .",
    "in addition , we see that there is an interval about the origin in which it is very likely to find the particle .",
    "an asymptotic analysis of the walk shows that this region lies between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath0 is the number of steps in the walk and @xmath36 is the transmission amplitude of the vertices @xcite .",
    "that is , the region in which the the particle is likely to be found grows as @xmath0 instead of @xmath51 as would be the case in a standard random walk .",
    "[ fig1 ]    thinking about the particle making the walk and the scattering centers as beam splitters , we see that this type of quantum walk is analogous to the propagation of light through an interferometer .",
    "this suggests that we can add a new element to quantum walks that has no analogue in classical random walks .",
    "interferometers are made up of multiports ( generalized beam splitters ) @xcite and phase shifters ; a phase shifter imparts a constant phase to a photon that passes through it .",
    "suppose we were to put a phase shifter that imparts a phase shift of @xmath52 just before the @xmath53 vertex .",
    "the transition rules for the states adjacent to this vertex are modified , while the rules for all other states are unaffected .",
    "in particular , we now have @xmath54 insertion of a phase shifter into an edge can change the properties of a quantum walk , because it changes how different paths interfere .",
    "so far we have only considered vertices at which two edges meet , but if we are to construct graphs more complicated than lines , we need to see how a vertex with more that two edges emanating from it behaves .",
    "we shall begin by looking at an example .",
    "if a vertex treats all edges entering it in an equivalent fashion , then we have a particulary simple situation , because the edges of the graph do not have to be labelled .",
    "one vertex of this type is very closely related to the quantum coin used in the walk on the hypercube @xcite .",
    "let the vertex at which all of the edges meet be labelled by @xmath55 , and the opposite ends of the edges be labelled by the numbers @xmath2 through @xmath0 .",
    "for any input state , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is an integer between @xmath2 and @xmath0 , the transition rule is that the amplitude to go the output state @xmath58 is @xmath37 , and the amplitude to go to any other output state is @xmath36 .",
    "that is , the amplitude to be reflected is @xmath37 , and the amplitude to be transmitted through any of the other edges is @xmath36 .",
    "unitarity places two conditions on these amplitudes @xmath59 we shall call such vertices equal - transmission vertices . as an example , for the case @xmath60 , possible values of @xmath37 and @xmath36 are @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    in order to construct a walk for a general graph ,",
    "one chooses a unitary operator for each vertex , i.e.  one that maps the states coming into a vertex to states leaving the same vertex .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath63 be the set of oriented edges starting at the vertex @xmath25 and @xmath64 be the linear span of @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath65 be the set of oriented edges ending at the vertex @xmath25 , and @xmath66 be the linear span of @xmath65 .",
    "we have that @xmath67 and @xmath68 if @xmath69 , which implies that @xmath70 and @xmath71 where the unions and direct sums are over all vertices of the graph .",
    "the local unitary operator , @xmath72 maps @xmath66 to @xmath64 , and describes the scattering at vertex @xmath25 .",
    "one step of the walk consists of the combined effect of all of these operations ; the overall unitary operator , @xmath73 , that advances the walk one step is constructed from the local operators for each vertex .",
    "explicitly , the edge state @xmath28 , which is the state for the particle going from vertex @xmath25 to vertex @xmath26 , will go to the state @xmath74 after one step , where @xmath75 is the operator corresponding to vertex @xmath26 .",
    "this prescription guarantees that the overall operation is unitary , in particular , @xmath73 acting on any other edge state @xmath76 will give a state orthogonal to @xmath77 .",
    "if @xmath78 , then @xmath28 and @xmath76 will be mapped into @xmath79 , but the unitarity of @xmath75 ensures that @xmath77 and @xmath80 are orthogonal .",
    "if @xmath81 , then @xmath73 maps @xmath28 and @xmath76 onto different sets of states , @xmath79 and @xmath82 , respectively , and the results are then orthogonal . therefore , as the edge states make up an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space in which the walk occurs , and @xmath73 maps this basis to another orthonormal basis , it is unitary .",
    "let us put all of this together in a very simple example .",
    "consider the graph shown in figure 2 , where each of the vertices where two edges meet have @xmath43 and @xmath44 , while the three - edge vertices are of the type discussed in the previous section , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "there is a phase shifter with an adjustable phase , @xmath52 , in one of the edges .",
    "the graph goes to negative infinity on the left and plus infinity on the right .",
    "note that it is very simple to construct the unitary operator that advances a quantum walk on this graph by one step ; one simply combines the actions of the operators corresponding to each vertex .",
    "[ fig2 ]    we can find the unnormalized eigenstates for this graph , and one set of them can be described as having an incoming wave from the left , an outgoing transmitted wave going to the right , and a reflected wave going to the left .",
    "a second set will have an incoming wave from the right , an outgoing trasmitted wave to the left , and a refelected wave to the right .",
    "the mathematical status of these objects will be explored in sections 7 and 8 . finally , there may be bound states , i.e.  eigenstates that are localized in the region between the two vertices with three edges .",
    "now , let us denote the left three - edge vertex by @xmath1 and the right one by @xmath83 , and number the vertices on the lines correspondingly , from @xmath83 to plus infinity to the right and from @xmath1 to minus infinity to the left .",
    "the eigenstates with a wave incident from the left take the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the part of the eigenfunction between vertices @xmath1 and @xmath83 , and @xmath86 is the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath73 that advances the walk one step .",
    "the first term can be thought of as the incoming wave ; it is confined to the region between negative infinity and @xmath1 , and consists of states in which the particle is moving to the right .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath87 is the reflected wave .",
    "it is also confined to the region between negative infinity and @xmath1 , but consists of states in which the particle is moving to the left . finally ,",
    "the term proportional to @xmath88 is the transmitted , being confined to the region from @xmath83 to infinity , and consisting of states with the particle moving to the right .",
    "the coefficient @xmath87 can be interpretted as the amplitude for the incoming wave to be reflected , and @xmath88 as the amplitude to be transmitted . denoting the upper vertex between @xmath1 and @xmath83 as @xmath89 and the lower one as @xmath90",
    ", we can express @xmath85 as @xmath91 the solution of the equation @xmath92 is given in the appendix .",
    "one can define a transmission coefficient for this graph , which is just the ratio of the intensities of the outgoing transmitted and the incoming waves , @xmath93 one finds that for @xmath94 , t is nonzero , because the two paths from @xmath1 to @xmath83 interfere constructively , while when @xmath95 they interfere destructively , which results in @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the behavior of the walk strongly depends on the value of the phase shift .",
    "suppose we want to find out whether the particle making the walk is on the edge between vertices @xmath40 and @xmath97 . the relevant projection operator is @xmath98 if we obtain @xmath2 the particle is on that edge , and if we obtain @xmath1 , it is not .",
    "what we wish to find out is , if the particle is initially in the state @xmath99 , the probability that the particle is not on the edge for the first @xmath0 steps of the walk , but is on the @xmath100st .",
    "we measure @xmath101 after every step , and we have to take the effect of these meaurements into account in describing the dynamics of the wave function .",
    "let us first see what happens after one step . let @xmath73 be the unitary operator that advances the walk one step .",
    "the probability that the particle is not on the edge between @xmath40 and @xmath97 after one step , @xmath102 , is @xmath103 and the quantum state , assuming the particle was not found on this edge , is @xmath104 now let us go one more step to see the pattern .",
    "the probability that the particle is not on the edge between @xmath40 and @xmath97 after either the first or second steps , @xmath105 , is @xmath106 and the quantum state , assuming the particle was not found on the edge after either step , is @xmath107 in general , if @xmath108 is the probability of not finding the particle on the edge between @xmath40 and @xmath97 after each of @xmath0 steps , then @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the quantum state after @xmath111 steps and @xmath111 measurements indicating that the particle was not on the designated edge .",
    "we also have that @xmath112    let us now proceed by induction .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath113^{n}\\psi ( 0)\\|^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "{ \\| [ ( i - p_{j})u]^{n}\\psi ( 0)\\| } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which clearly holds for @xmath114",
    ". substitution of the second of these equations into eq .",
    "( [ staten ] ) yields @xmath115 so that part of our induction hypothesis is verfied . from eq .",

    "this result is easily generalized to the case of making measurements to determine whether the particle is on a set of edges instead of on a single edge .",
    "a similar result for the coined quantum walk was derived by bach , _ et al_. @xcite .",
    "the hitting time for a random walk on a graph is the expected number of steps in a walk that starts at one specified vertex and stops on first reaching a second specified vertex . in order to calculate this",
    "we need the probability that a walk starting on the first vertex does not reach the second for its first @xmath111 steps , but does reach it on the @xmath0th step .",
    "the corresponding quantity for a quantum walk , which we shall call @xmath117 , is the probability that a walk starting in the state @xmath99 is not measured to be on the edge between @xmath40 and @xmath97 for the first @xmath111 steps , but is measured to be on that edge at the @xmath0th step .",

    "let us now consider the situation depicted in figure 3 .",
    "we start the walk on the edge @xmath122 moving to the right , and we are interested in how long it takes to get to the edge @xmath34 , where @xmath123 is a general graph with a finite number of edges and vertices .",
    "the vertices outside of the graph , @xmath123 , for example , @xmath124 and @xmath97 , have a transmission amplitude , @xmath43 .",
    "we shall denote the entire graph , @xmath123 plus the tails , as @xmath125 . the case considered in",
    "the previous section is a special case of this situation .",
    "when calculating the probability , @xmath117 , that the walk arrives at the edge @xmath34 for the first time after @xmath0 steps , we need to evaluate ( see eq .",
    "( [ qn ] ) ) @xmath126^{n-1}=p_{j}u^{n}-\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}p_{j}u^{(n - k ) }",
    "p_{j}u^{k } + \\ldots\\ ] ] we first note that once the particle leaves the graph , @xmath123 , it moves one unit to the right with each step .",
    "that means that terms of the form @xmath127 , for @xmath128 , are zero , because the first @xmath101 puts the particle in the state @xmath34 , and the operator @xmath129 moves it @xmath22 steps to the right , so that the particle in now in the state @xmath130 .",
    "the projection @xmath101 acting on this state gives zero .",
    "therefore , only the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ out ] ) gives a nonzero contribution .",
    "that means that in this case , we have @xmath131    [ fig3 ]    we now want to relate the probability @xmath117 to the transmission coefficient of the graph , which we shall define shortly",
    ". the eigenstates of the system can be grouped into three sets , those with the particle coming in from the left , those with the particle coming in from the right , and bound states .",
    "the eigenstates of this system corresponding to the particle coming in from the left are @xmath132 is the transmission coefficient , and @xmath133 is the part of the eigenfunction inside the graph @xmath123 .",
    "this state is , in fact , not in @xmath30 , and its mathematical significance will be clarified in a later section . in appendix",
    "b we show that latexmath:[\\[\\label{reftrans }     for the initial state of our walk we will choose @xmath122 , and we want to express this state in terms of the eigenstates in eq .",

    "so we integrate @xmath135 from @xmath1 to @xmath136 , finding @xmath137.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by setting @xmath138 the integrals on the right - hand side of the above equation can be turned into integrals along the unit circle , which we shall denote by @xmath139 , in the complex plane .",
    "these integrals are of the form @xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "as we shall show in section 7 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 are analytic functions of @xmath145 on the unit circle and in its interior , and they all vanish when @xmath146 .",
    "this implies that all of the above integrals are zero .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that @xmath147    now we have that @xmath148 and @xmath149 therefore , we find @xmath150 which relates a walk probability , the probability to land on the edge between @xmath40 and @xmath97 for the first time after @xmath0 steps , to the s matrix of the graph @xmath123 .",
    "we can rewrite the integral appearing in the above expression for @xmath117 as a contour integral over the unit circle , @xmath139 by setting @xmath151 .",
    "this gives us @xmath152 because , as we shall see , @xmath143 is analytic in a region containing the unit circle and its interior , the only contribution to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ integral ] ) comes from the pole at the origin that is due to the @xmath153 factor .",
    "this fact makes it straightforward to evaluate the above integral , by just finding the residue of the pole at the origin , giving us @xmath154 this is just the @xmath155 coefficient in the taylor expansion of @xmath143 about the origin , i.e.  if @xmath156 then we have that @xmath157 .",

    "we then have that @xmath165 thus , we see that both the probability of first hitting the edge between @xmath40 and @xmath97 in @xmath0 steps and the hitting time to reach this edge are related to the transmission amplitude of the graph .",
    "let us now apply this formula to a walk on the graph discussed in section 3 .",
    "the transmission amplitude for this graph is @xmath166 and @xmath167 from this expression we see explicitly that @xmath143 is analytic inside and on the unit circle .    considering the case @xmath94 we find the simple expression @xmath168 inserting this result into the expressions in the previous section , it is straightforward to perform the integrations , and we find that @xmath169 for small @xmath0 , it is relatively straightforward to verify the expression for @xmath117 by adding up the amplitudes for the possible paths from @xmath122 to @xmath170 of length @xmath0 .",
    "another issue that deserves mention is the existence of bound states . in standard quantum scattering theory , if a potential has bound states , these are orthgonal to all scattering states .",
    "what we mean by a bound state of a graph , is an eigenstate of @xmath73 whose support is confined to @xmath123 .",
    "if our graph has bound states , then these states could not be accessed by a particle coming in from one of the tails , e.g.  from the left .",
    "this follows from the fact that the initial state is orthogonal to any bound state ( a state localized on one of the tails is automatically orthogonal to one that is localized in @xmath123 ) , and if @xmath171 is the initial state , and @xmath172 is the localized eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath173 , we have @xmath174 this limits the walks that particles with initial states of this type can perform , because , as the above equation shows , the state of the walk at any time must be orthogonal to all of the bound states .    in order to find the bound states in our example we consider a state @xmath175 that is located on the four edges connecting the vertices @xmath1 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath83 , i.e. @xmath91 we then solve the equation @xmath92 .",
    "this equation only has a solution when @xmath94 , and in that case the eigenvalues are @xmath176 , where @xmath177 . the eigenstates in this case",
    "are given by @xmath178 a simple basis for the space spanned by these eigenstates is latexmath:[\\ ] ] where the sums are over all edges in @xmath123 .",
    "we are first interested in determining whether @xmath143 is analytic inside the unit circle",
    ". this will be the case if eq .",
    "( [ ginhom ] ) can be solved for all @xmath244 , which will be true if the matrix @xmath245 is invertible for @xmath244 .",
    "this follows from the result that if an operator , @xmath246 , is analytic in some region of the complex plane , so is its inverse , @xmath247 provided it exists @xcite . because @xmath248 we have that @xmath249 , which implies that if @xmath244 , then @xmath245 is invertible .",
    "we now have that @xmath143 and @xmath142 are analytic inside the unit circle , but what about on the circle itself and a bit beyond ? to show that they are , we need to refine our arguments .",
    "1 .   @xmath250 if and only if @xmath251 is an @xmath252 eigenstate of @xmath73 with support in the edges of @xmath123 .",
    "we call these bound states .",
    "2 .   if @xmath253 , then @xmath254 , where @xmath251 is any bound state .",
    "1 .   @xmath255 + so @xmath256 and the support of @xmath251 lies in the edges of @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , @xmath257 , and @xmath251 is the desired eigenstate .",
    "2 .   this follows from @xmath258    if @xmath86 corresponds to a bound state , then the operator @xmath259 is not invertible . at the moment this leaves us without a method of defining @xmath143 and @xmath142 for values of @xmath145 corresponding to bound states .",
    "we would like to show , however , that for these values of @xmath145 , scattering solutions , that is solutions to eq .",
    "( [ ginhom ] ) , also exist .",
    "these solutions can then be used to define @xmath143 and @xmath142 .",

    "@xmath278 is the solution to the generalized eigenvalue equation @xmath281 .",
    "let us now make two brief observations .",
    "first , note that the functions @xmath282 and @xmath238 are just the restrictions of @xmath143 and @xmath142 to the unit circle .",
    "second , we see that the above theorem , along with the expressions for @xmath143 and @xmath142 , provides the necessary conditions for all of the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ int0 ] ) to vanish .",
    "the formal eigenvectors @xmath283 , which we just constructed , are elements of @xmath279 , and hence , for any @xmath284 , the inner product @xmath285 is well - defined , because it is absolutely summable .",
    "however , if @xmath286 is merely in @xmath30 , @xmath285 is not necessarily summable . due to the specific form of @xmath287 , this sum represents a fourier series with square - summable coefficients , and",
    "hence it is a function in @xmath288 , where @xmath289 is the unit circle with the usual measure @xmath290 .",
    "we shall now exploit these two interpretations of our formulas .",
    "recall that @xmath263 is the space of bound states , i.e.  @xmath252 eigenfunctions of @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath263 is a finite - dimensional , @xmath73-invariant subspace of @xmath207 .",
    "each element of @xmath263 has its support contained among the edges of @xmath123 .",
    "the function ( vector ) @xmath291 constructed in the last section is seen to be the unique element of @xmath279 such that ,    1 .",

    "@xmath293 , 3 .",
    "@xmath294 for any @xmath295 .    the analytic extension of @xmath287 to @xmath296",
    "is given by @xmath278 ( see eq .  ( [ psi(z ) ] ) ) , and a direct application of the cauchy integral theorem to @xmath278 implies that @xmath297 if @xmath298 , then @xmath285 is a continuous function on the circle , and @xmath299 in particular , if @xmath300 , we have @xmath301 from this we have that @xmath302 hence , for each @xmath286 in the linear span of the states @xmath303 , where @xmath57 is an integer , and for any trigometric polynomial @xmath304 , we have the @xmath305 formulas @xmath306 eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) is an @xmath305 formula , however , eq .  ( [ d ] ) is more general .",
    "it holds for any @xmath286 that is a finite linear combination of the @xmath303 , for @xmath57 an integer .",
    "however , @xmath307 is an @xmath252 function on the circle for each @xmath308 .",

    "( [ d ] ) holds for @xmath310 and for any complex - valued continuous function on @xmath289 .",
    "thus , by the riesz - markov theorem there exists a unique measure @xmath311 , a borel measure on the circle , called the spectral measure associated to @xmath286 , such that @xmath312 and hence , @xmath313    if we define @xmath314 by @xmath315 then eq .  ( [ d ] ) implies that @xmath316 , so that @xmath317 is an isometry from @xmath309 to @xmath288 , and @xmath318 is a closed subspace of @xmath288 .",
    "finally , we have @xmath319 for @xmath320 which implies that @xmath318 is an invariant subspace of the multiplication operator @xmath321 .",
    "therefore , we have that @xmath322 , and hence @xmath317 is a unitary operator of @xmath309 onto @xmath288",
    ". we can summarize our results to date in the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath309 be the closed , linear , u - invariant subspace of @xmath201 generated by the states @xmath303 , for @xmath57 an integer .",
    "let @xmath287 be the generalized eigenfunctions constructed in the previous section , then for each @xmath310 , @xmath315 defines a unitary operator from @xmath309 onto @xmath288 , such that for each @xmath323 , @xmath324 hence , we have constructed part of the spectral decomposition of @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath325 be the closed , @xmath73-invariant subspace of @xmath207 generated by the vectors @xmath326 , for @xmath57 an integer .",
    "in the same way as was done in the previous section , we can construct generalized eigenfunctions @xmath327 which satisfy the results of the last theorem of the previous section .",
    "if we follow the arguments above , we arrive at the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath325 and @xmath328 be as above .",
    "then for each @xmath329 , @xmath330 defines a unitary operator from @xmath325 onto @xmath288 , such that for each @xmath323 , @xmath331    it has already been shown and is easy to see that @xmath309 , @xmath325 , and @xmath263 are mutually orthogonal , @xmath73-invariant subspaces of @xmath201 .",
    "the final result of this section is that these subspaces exhuast @xmath207 , and , therefore , this completes the spectral decomposition of @xmath73 on @xmath207 .",
    "@xmath332 .",

    "then a direct calculation shows that @xmath287 viewed as a function defined as on the edges , @xmath24 , is identically zero .",
    "we have explored a number of properties of quantum walks on graphs .",
    "the main result is that there is a connection between the s matrix of a graph and the properties of a quantum walk on that graph . in particular , the probability that a quantum walk traverses a graph in @xmath0 steps and the conditional hitting time to make a walk traversing a graph can be expressed in terms of the transmission amplitude of that graph .",
    "this required studying the analyticity properties of the reflection and transmission coefficients of the graph .",
    "in addition , we have shown that graphs can have bound states that quantum walks starting on an edge leading into the graph can not access .",
    "we also defined what it means for a quantum walks on a graph to be time - reversal invariant , and used this property to show when transmission amplitudes for particles coming from different directions will be the same .",
    "it should be possible to extend all of the arguments here to the case in which a graph has more than two tails attached to it .",
    "that means that it can have multiple entrances and exits .",
    "this will simply result in the s - matrix of the graph having multiple channels .",
    "we want to solve the equation @xmath92 . substituting in the explicit expression for @xmath175",

    "b_{0a } \\nonumber \\\\        \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\\\        our object is to find @xmath88 and @xmath87 from which we can find the transmission and refelection coefficients , respectively , of the graph . keeping this in mind ,",
    "these ten equations can readily be reduced to six @xmath336 these equations can then be solved , giving us @xmath337 note that @xmath88 is just the transmission amplitude , @xmath282 , for the graph , and @xmath87 is its reflection amplitude .",
    "we want to show that eq .",
    "( [ reftrans ] ) is true . a graph is specified by its set of vertices , @xmath338 , and its set of edges , @xmath24 .",
    "a state @xmath339 can be expressed as @xmath340 consider a set of vertices in a graph , @xmath19 , and its complement @xmath341 . defining @xmath342",
    "note that if @xmath343 , then @xmath344 is just the probability that a particle in the state@xmath345 will be found on one of the edges in the set @xmath346 , with similar considerations for @xmath347 , and this justifies the notation .",
    "we can now apply this to the state @xmath351 and choose the set @xmath19 to be the vertices of @xmath123 .",
    "application of @xmath73 to this state gives us @xmath352 and a short calculation shows that @xmath353 .",
