    "the outburst of v1309 sco in 2008 has played a key role in our understanding of the rare red nova eruptions .",
    "very few such events were previously known .",
    "the well - studied v838 mon ( bond et al . 2003 ) had shown distinct similarities in its spectral evolution to transients v4332 sgr and m31 rv .",
    "tylenda & soker ( 2006 ) suggested that all three events were caused by mergers in binary stars .",
    "however , it was not until the eruption of v1309 sco that direct observations of a red nova progenitor could support this theory .",
    "mason et al .",
    "( 2010 ) presented thorough observations of the v1309 sco outburst and pointed out its similarities to red novae .",
    "they derived a peak absolute magnitude of @xmath1mag and a maximum emission line fwhm of @xmath2km / s .",
    "tylenda et al . (",
    "2011 ) used archive data from the ogle project to show that the progenitor is a w uma ( contact ) binary with a period of @xmath3d and a @xmath4mag amplitude .",
    "moreover , the period had been decreasing exponentially for at least six years before the outburst , reaching @xmath5d in 2007 .",
    "the ogle lightcurve also showed slow brightness variations as the i magnitude remained in the range @xmath6mag before the outburst .",
    "tylenda et al . (",
    "2011 ) obtained an effective temperature of the progenitor of 4500k under certain approximations for the interstellar reddening .",
    "an exact value was difficult to derive due to the proximity of v1309 sco to the galactic plane .",
    "five galactic red novae are currently known ",
    "v4332 sgr , v838 mon , v1309 sco , the highly reddened ogle-2002-blg-360 and allegedly , the 1670 eruption of ck vul ( kaminski et al .",
    "2015 ) . with the addition of several extragalactic transients , such as m31 rv ( rich et al .",
    "1989 ) , m85 ot2006 - 1",
    "( kulkarni et al . 2007 ) , and m31lrn 2015 ( kurtenkov et al . 2015 ) , they constitute a rare class of mostly very luminous events . as of 2016",
    "v1309 sco remains the only red nova with a well - studied progenitor , and the only direct proof that stellar mergers cause red novae .",
    "the archival observations of v1309 sco have presented the unique opportunity of studying the transition of a stellar merger process from a quiescent phase ( eclipsing binary with a decreasing orbital period ) to a dynamic phase ( red nova explosion , ultimately leaving the merger product engulfed in dust ) .",
    "a prediction of such an event will allow for a much more detailed exploration of the progenitor system , e.g. mass and temperature determination via multicolor photometry , or observing the spectral evolution of the common envelope .",
    "such results can be used to improve the relations between the parameters of the progenitor system and the parameters of the transient .",
    "an attempt at studying these relations was made by kochanek et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , although the statistical sample is still quite small .",
    "a red nova prediction was made by molnar et al .",
    "( 2015 ) for the kepler eclipsing binary kic 9832227 .    as discussed by tylenda et al .",
    "( 2011 ) the merging can be triggered by the evolution of the primary component .",
    "it grows in size as it crosses the hertzsprung gap and the system starts losing mass and angular momentum through the @xmath7 lagrangian point . as the v1309 sco progenitor probably included an evolved k - star ,",
    "this scenario is compatible with the observations .",
    "furthermore , the observed orbital period of @xmath3d is unusually long for w uma - type binaries , so it requires a large semi - major axis , and respectively , large radii .",
    "similarly , many long - period contact binaries can be seen as potential merger candidates and their exploration could give us an insight into the physics of red nova progenitors .",
    "the last decades have shown a radical increase in the number of known eclipsing binary systems , owing to modern time - based sky surveys , such as nsvs , asas , and most recently , the catalina sky survey .",
    "the latter has produced a catalog including @xmath8 contact and ellipsoidal binaries ( drake et al .",
    "2014 ) . as of june 2016 the vsx ( variable star index ) database lists a total of 39634 w uma - type binaries .",
    "the present work aims to show that the number of known contact binaries is sufficient to draw an object selection of possible v1309 sco - like systems .",
    "contact binaries that show similar characteristics as v1309 sco could be at the same evolutionary stage at which the mechanism that led to the 2008 eruption is triggered . the selected systems in section 3 could prove to be promising targets of follow - up observations , aiming to derive their absolute parameters and to look for period changes .",
    "another important addition to the exploration of eclipsing binaries has been the kepler eclipsing binary catalog ( slawson et al .",
    "it could be a powerful tool in the search of stellar merger candidates as it provides high - quality lightcurves with exact minima timing .",
    "section 4 is dedicated to selecting stellar merger candidates from kepler and ogle binaries with considerable eclipse timing variations .",
    "binaries of the w uma type have typical orbital periods in the range @xmath9d . however , the vsx database currently lists 1125 w uma binaries with @xmath10d .",
    "some of them are misclassified @xmath11 lyrae as those variables have similar lightcurve shapes but generally larger periods .",
    "the distribution of cataloged long - period w uma binaries is shown in fig.[p_distribution ] . in the @xmath12d period range",
    "there are still relatively many systems cataloged as w uma binaries .",
    "also plotted is how the ratio of cataloged w uma to @xmath11 lyr binaries changes with the orbital period . in case all systems in the @xmath12d period range cataloged",
    "as contact binaries were misclassified @xmath11 lyrae , this ratio would not decrease after @xmath13d .",
    "many systems in this period range could be contact binaries with one or two evolved components and , therefore , objects of the current study .",
    "d , expressed in percentages of all 39634 such systems in the vsx .",
    "the dark line represents the ratio of cataloged w uma to @xmath11 lyr binaries for each period interval .",
    "the ratio decreases after @xmath13d , which implies that the majority of cataloged w uma binaries with periods in the @xmath12d range are not misclassified @xmath11 lyrae .",
    "the left y - scale applies to bars , while the right y - scale applies to lines .",
    "all data is extracted from the vsx database.,width=487 ]    the somewhat narrower period range between 1.1d and 1.8d is approximately centered on the v1309 sco period . as of june 2016",
    "the vsx lists 506 systems of the w uma type in it . of those ,",
    "207 were identified in the ninth release of the sdss catalog ( ahn et al .",
    "2012 ) within a search radius of 2 .",
    "the sdss catalog provides multicolor photometry in the sloan @xmath14 passbands .",
    "the imaging data of a given object is obtained with a @xmath15sec delay between two consecutive filters , so there is a @xmath16min interval between the @xmath17-band and @xmath18-band frames",
    ". therefore it can be safely assumed that the imaging of @xmath19 binaries in all passbands is simultaneous .",
    "the colors of contact binaries slightly vary with phase due to the temperature difference of the components and the gravity darkening effect .",
    "both effects are of the order of @xmath20k , which allows for a satisfactory estimate of the temperature of the common envelope using multicolor photometry at a given phase .",
    "the color - temperature relations derived by boyajian et al .",
    "( 2013 ) were used for this purpose .",
    "these relations are of the form    @xmath21    where x represents the color index and @xmath22 is the effective photospheric temperature .",
    "the coefficients derived by boyajian et al .",

    "therefore , a more detailed exploration of these systems could bring an insight into the physics of a red nova progenitor .",
    "an prediction of a stellar merger in the near future would require evidence that the orbital period is decreasing .",
