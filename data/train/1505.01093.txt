    "the occurrence of tdes was first predicted based on theoretical considerations in the seventies . at that time , many important theoretical foundations were laid , and first ideas emerged , on the relevance and usage of tdes in astrophysical context ( hills 1975 , frank & rees 1976 , young et al .",

    "can extreme tdes explain variants of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ?",
    "are tdes a unique signpost of the presence of dormant smbhs at the cores of inactive galaxies ?    events were discovered in the nineties in form of luminous , soft x - ray outbursts from otherwise quiescent galaxies during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , and have more recently been found with other x - ray missions , and at longer wavelengths .",
    "the _ swift _ mission has been a game changer in this field .",
    "its discovery of the first tde which launched a relativistic jet , swiftj1644 + 57 , has triggered many theoretical studies on the formation of radio jets , and swiftj1644 + 57 has now the best - covered lightcurve of any tde to date .",

    "white dwarfs can be tidally disrupted for smbh masses below @xmath2 10@xmath5 m@xmath4 .",
    "computations of the stellar evolution , including the early stages of stellar deformation , the actual disruption , accretion and ejection of material , the development of a disk wind , and the evolution and late stages of the accretion phase , and for different types of stars , are very challenging .",

    "stone & loeb 2011 , 2012a , li et al . 2012 , liu & chen 2013 ) and spinning bhs ( kesden 2012 ) .",
    "these have shown that rates are strongly boosted in some phases of binary smbh evolution and the early phase of smbh recoil , and that rates strongly depend on bh spin for the most massive bhs ( @xmath6 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "tidally disrupted stars will also produce a gravitational wave signal along with the electromagnetic emission ( e.g. , east 2014 , and references therein ) .",
    "there is now increasing evidence that smbhs reside at the centers of many massive galaxies ( review by graham 2015 ) .",
    "tdes likely significantly contributed to growing smbhs at low masses ( @xmath7 m@xmath8 ; freitag & benz 2002 ) , while stars swallowed whole may have contributed to smbh growth at high masses ( zhao et al .",
    "one initial idea was to use tde flares as tracers of dormant smbhs in quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , rees 1988 ) .",
    "this will continue to be an important topic in the future , since the luminous accretion flares reach out to large cosmic distances , and tdes will be detected in large numbers in future transient surveys ( sect .",
    "in addition , many other applications have been suggested , making use of the characteristic tde properties and rates :    * in x - rays , tdes probe relativistic effects ( via emission - line profiles or precession effects in the kerr metric ) and the extremes of accretion physics at high rates and near the last stable orbit , and provide us with a new means of measuring bh spin . *",
    "jetted tdes provide new insight into the formation and early evolution of radio jets , and may shed new light on related issues like the cause of the radio - loud radio - quiet dichotomy of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . *",
    "tdes , once detected in large numbers , will unveil the population of imbhs in the universe .",
    "* tde rates depend on , and therefore trace , stellar dynamics in galaxy cores on spatial scales which can not be resolved directly .",
    "* tdes are signposts of binary smbhs and recoiling bhs , because their rates are strongly enhanced under these conditions , and tdes will occur off - nuclear if the smbh is recoiling . *",
    "tdes in gas - rich environments will illuminate the circum - nuclear material , so that the reprocessed emission lines and their temporal evolution provide us with an unparalleled opportunity of reverberation mapping the cores of quiescent galaxies .    here , we present an overview of the status of observations of tdes , highlighting the important role plaid by the _ swift _ mission ( gehrels et al .",

    "while recoiling smbhs and ongoing galaxy mergers will produce off - nuclear tdes ( komossa & merritt 2008 , liu & chen 2013 ) , these events would be rare in the local universe , and the vast majority of nearby tdes should therefore arise from the very cores of their host galaxies .",

    "the magnetic field strength estimated for swiftj1644 + 57 is much higher than that of a main - sequence star , and must have then been generated locally in the disk , or requires the presence of a fossil disk .",
    "regarding the source of the long - term radio emission there is overall concencus that it is very likely synchrotron radiation from the shock which is formed when the jet interacts with the interstellar medium .",
    "another focus of attention has been the nature of the x - ray emission and its rapid variability and early epochs of high - amplitude flaring .",
    "most models have linked it with dissipation in the inner jet ( and/or effects of jet precession or nutation ) , and/or the forward shock , rather than directly with emission from the accretion disk .",
    "finally , a topic of close consideration has been the trajectory and type of the disrupted star .",
    "while several studies have assumed , or explored , the disruption of a main - sequence star , arguments have also been made in favor of the disruption of a white dwarf ( krolik & piran 2011 ) , a giant star ( shao et al .",

    "since the x - rays vary rapidly before the drop , an origin near the smbh rather than in a forward shock is implied ( pasham et al . 2015 ) .",
    "the possibility that tdes launch radio jets , came up with the detection of the first few x - ray tdes with _ rosat_. in order to test , whether tdes do launch radio jets ( and to exclude a peculiar mini - blazar at the galaxy core ) , radio follow - ups of ngc5905 were performed with the vla ( komossa 2002 ) 6 years after the initial x - ray outburst .",

    "the two exceptions ( bower et al . 2013 ) are the seyfert galaxy ic3599 [ the radio emission in this agn is most likely linked to the long - lived seyfert activity of this galaxy , and the nature of its ( repeat ) x - ray flaring remains debated ; e.g. , komossa et al .",

    "tdes might well occur in agn , too , and rates are expected to be high ( karas & subr 2007 ) .",
    "however , it is generally more challenging to identify tdes in agn because of the much lower contrast of any tde - related accretion flare relative to the permanently bright accretion disk .",
    "further , it is more difficult to uniquely associate any particular flare in classical agn ( i.e. , galaxies which show long - lived activity in x - rays , and/or radio , and characteristic bright emission - lines from the narrow - line region ) with a tde , because processes in the long - lived accretion disk itself can potentially cause high - amplitude variability .",
