    "<S> in this letter we study the local persistence of the two  </S>",
    "<S> dimensional blume capel model by extension of the concept of glauber dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we verify that for any value of the ratio @xmath0 between anisotropy @xmath1 and exchange @xmath2 the persistence shows a power law behavior . </S>",
    "<S> in particular for @xmath3 we find a persistence exponent @xmath4 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ in the ising universality class . for @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) </S>",
    "<S> we observe the occurrence of blocking .    among the many relevant quantities of interest in the modelling of nonequilibrium dynamics of spin systems such as _ first time passage _ @xcite , which has been extensively discussed in the literature due to the appearance of non  trivial exponents in the power law behavior of the first return probability as function of time </S>",
    "<S> , another quantity of interest is that of _ persistence _ , _ i.e. _ the characterization of the time it takes for a particular spin _ not _ to change its state from its given @xmath7 configuration . defining @xmath8 as the probability that a particular spin will not flip up to time @xmath9 , at zero temperature temperature and for the ising and potts models </S>",
    "<S> this quantity was shown to behave as @xcite @xmath10where the _ persistence _ exponent @xmath11 describes the non - equilibrium relaxation of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this has been determined through _ coarsening _ simulations since one expects that the fraction of spins which do not change up to @xmath9 represents a good estimate of @xmath8 . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> one may introduced a global version of the concept of persistence through the quantity @xmath12 which represents the probability that the magnetization does not change its sign from its @xmath7 value , as done in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently one of the authors explored these ideas to determine the associated @xmath13 exponent in the blume capel model , in particular its behavior at the critical and tricritical points @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the exponent shows an abrupt change as one goes from the critical points ( @xmath14 , ising universality class ) to the tricritical one .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to extend the glauber dynamics to the blume capel model and to study the influence of the anisotropy on the exponent @xmath15 . for the sake of clarity , we start with a brief overview of the ising model .    at @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics can be greatly affected by local _ blocking _ configurations , and the energy necessary to overcome them might be so high as to render the system static . on the other hand , for @xmath17 it becomes difficult to define domains because one might not be able to distinguish between true domains and spin flips due to thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless for the ising model these difficulties can be overcome and a power law a power law decay for the fraction of persistent spins was ascertained in the whole low temperature phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated values of the exponent were @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath16 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore for @xmath23 an exponential cutoff was verified . indeed , using a natural definition of persistence , </S>",
    "<S> the blocking effects is sensible to any temperature value , and power law only happens exactly in @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics is implemented as follows : define the excitation energy @xmath24 associated to the transition @xmath25 as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 equal to the sum of nearest neighbors to @xmath28 . if @xmath29 then the transition occurs with probability 1 . for @xmath24 @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> it occurs with probability @xmath31 and the transition does not occur if @xmath32 .    to extend these ideas to the blume - capel model </S>",
    "<S> we start out with the hamiltonian @xmath33where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath1 represents an anisotropy . as we shall see </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the persistence exponent is strongly dependent on the value of @xmath0 yielding a nontrivial extension of the ising model . to implement the glauber dynamics in the ground state at ( @xmath36 ) we consider the excitation energy ( in units of @xmath2 ) for the transition @xmath37 as follows : @xmath38\\]]with @xmath39\\cap \\mathbb{z}$ ] . to extend the @xmath16 single spin glauber dynamics from a 2state to a 3state model is not straightforward and some rules have to be introduced . </S>",
    "<S> let the energy differences in the transition from @xmath40 to any other two spin states @xmath41 or @xmath42 be represented by @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> there are six possibilities to consider :    1 .   if @xmath45 @xmath46 , then @xmath47 ; 2 .   if @xmath48 and @xmath49 , then @xmath50 ; 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , then @xmath50 with probability @xmath53 ; 4 .   if @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 or @xmath57 with probability = @xmath58 ; 5 .   </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath59 @xmath55 @xmath40 goes to any of the three states with probability = @xmath60 ; 6 .   if @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the transition does not occur .    with these rules </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo simulations were performed at @xmath16 for an @xmath63 square lattice with @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> since the sample number @xmath65 does not play an important role because of the absence of significant statistical fluctuations ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) we used @xmath66 with @xmath67  mc steps . after some exploratory simulations a total of @xmath68 different values of @xmath69 within @xmath70 $ ] </S>",
    "<S> where chosen .    </S>",
    "<S> after the 300th mc step convergence to power laws are found , as can be seen in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath3 we obtained the exponent @xmath71 by measuring directly the slope in the interval @xmath72 $ ] , with error bars obtained using 5 different bins . </S>",
    "<S> a more precise estimate can be obtained using the definition of the effective exponent ( local slope ) : @xmath73     for @xmath74 and @xmath75 we obtain @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the same power law behavior was observed for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , however with slightly different exponents , as can be seen in table [ persloct=0bcalfa ] .    </S>",
    "<S> .local persistence exponent values of blume capel model [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for positive values of @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) the system shows blocking , as can seen in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> however a distinction must be made : in @xmath80 @xmath810,1[$ ] the persistence has a fast decay and reaches a constant value @xmath82 , while for @xmath80 @xmath831,2]$ ] the value is @xmath84 . for @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) and when @xmath87 there is full blocking with @xmath88 frozen to the value @xmath89 ( initial mean fraction of spins is null ) . in @xmath90 and @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that for @xmath87 the predominant phase is a configuration with all spins zero .    </S>",
    "<S> our values for @xmath3 are in agreement with more recent results for the ising model , namely @xmath91@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the point @xmath76 separates two distinct regions : a power law behavior for negative values of @xmath78 and a blocking phase for positive values of this ratio . at @xmath76 </S>",
    "<S> we have a power law behavior but with a different exponent .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting behavior is observed for @xmath77 , where a robust power law separates two different blocking `` phases '' . </S>",
    "<S> the point @xmath85 also divides two regions of distinct blocking behavior : the @xmath92 region and the full  blocking region @xmath87 .    to conclude , </S>",
    "<S> our results show that nontrivial behavior in stochastic persistence can appear as one extends the ising model to allow for higher `` spins '' and anisotropy effects as measured by our parameter @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular for @xmath3 one has a pure 2state ising behavior ; the same is not observed for different values of @xmath78 , as discussed in the text </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to test these ideas for different stochastic systems in the hope that there also nontrivial behavior might be found . </S>"
