    "the magnetism due to the localized @xmath6 electrons in the rare - earth based intermetallic compounds is always interesting due to the wide range of physical properties exhibited by these compounds .",
    "the binary rare - earth intermetallic systems have been studied over several decades . in particular , the ce based binary compounds are the most extensively studied as they exhibit many novel magnetic behavior owing to the close proximity of the @xmath6 level to the fermi level .",
    "like for example , ceal@xmath0 and cecu@xmath7 are heavy fermion kondo lattice compounds without any long - range magnetic order  @xcite , the cubic ceal@xmath8 and ceb@xmath7 are kondo lattice compounds that order magnetically at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "pressure induced superconductivity is observed in the binary compound cein@xmath0  @xcite . in view of these interesting properties of binary compounds , we wanted to investigate the magnetic properties of rmg@xmath0 ( r = la and ce ) compounds which crystallize in the cubic bif@xmath0- type structure . in one of the early reports on rmg@xmath0 system , buschow has studied the magnetic properties of cemg@xmath0 and ndmg@xmath0 and reported no magnetic ordering , down to 4.2  k , in these two compounds  @xcite .",
    "however , galera _ et al _ and pierre _ et al _ have found that cemg@xmath0 orders antiferromagnetically at 3.4  k  @xcite , while ndmg@xmath0 orders magnetically at 6  k  @xcite . from the previous neutron scattering experiments on polycrystalline sample  @xcite",
    ", it has been found that ndmg@xmath0 undergoes an antiferromagnetic ordering at @xmath9  k with the propagation vector * k *  =  ( 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 ) and the magnetic structure of ndmg@xmath0 possesses ferromagnetic layers of ( 111 ) which are stacked in opposite direction leading to an antiferromagnetic alignment along the [ 111 ] axis .",
    "recently , tanida _ et al _ have performed a detailed magnetic measurements on prmg@xmath0 single crystal and found that prmg@xmath0 exhibits a nonmagnetic @xmath10 doublet ground state  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we report on the detailed magnetic properties of single crystalline lamg@xmath0 and cemg@xmath0 by studying the magnetization , electrical resistivity and heat capacity measurements .",
    "a crystal electric field ( cef ) analysis was performed on the susceptibility and heat capacity data and the energy levels thus obtained corroborates the previous neutron diffraction measurements performed on polycrystalline samples  @xcite .",
    "from the binary phase diagram of ce - mg and la - mg by nayeb - hasehmi and clark  @xcite it was found that both cemg@xmath0 and lamg@xmath0 melt congruently at temperature close to 800  @xmath11c .",
    "hence these compounds can be grown directly from the melt .",
    "owing to the high vapor pressure of mg , the single crystals were grown by bridgman method .",
    "the stoichiometric amounts of the rare - earth metal and magnesium were taken in a point bottomed alumina crucible and sealed in a molybdenum tube .",
    "this molybdenum tube was then subsequently sealed in a quartz ampoule and loaded into a box type furnace .",
    "the furnace was then raised to 850  @xmath11c , well above the melting point of these compounds and held at this temperature for 24  hours .",
    "then the samples were slowly cooled down to 780  @xmath11c over a period of 3  days .",
    "bulk shiny single crystals were obtained by gently taping on the alumina crucible and they were found to be stable in air .",
    "the crystals were then subjected to powder x - ray diffraction to check the phase purity .",
    "the orientation of the crystal was done by back reflection laue method .",
    "the dc magnetic susceptibility and the magnetization measurements were performed in the temperature range 1.8 - 300  k using a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) and vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) . the electrical resistivity was measured down to 1.9  k in a home made set up .",
    "the heat capacity was measured using a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "small pieces of the single crystals were crushed into fine powder and subjected to powder x - ray diffraction , using a panalytical x - ray diffractometer with monochromatic cu - k@xmath12 radiation , to check the phase purity and to estimate the lattice constant values .",
    "no traces of any secondary phases were seen in the x - ray diffractogram indicating the samples are phase pure .",
    "a rietveld analysis was performed and the representative powder x - ray diffraction pattern of cemg@xmath0 is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "a reasonably good fit of the experimental pattern confirms the space group @xmath13 ( # 225 ) and the    ( color online ) a representative powder x - ray diffraction pattern of cemg@xmath0 . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    estimated lattice constant was 7.468  @xmath14 for lamg@xmath0 and 7.422  @xmath14 for cemg@xmath0 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the nearest ce - ce distance is 5.248    .",
    "hence , cemg@xmath0 is a good system to study the competing ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction and kondo screening .",
    "the stoichiometry of the samples was further confirmed by the energy dispersive analysis by x - ray ( edax ) where the composition of the single crystal was analysed at various regions of the single crystal .",
    "it was found that the sample is highly homogeneous maintaining the stoichiometry through out the sample .",
    "the crystals were then oriented along the principal crystallographic direction namely [ 100 ] , by means of laue back reflection .",
    "the four fold symmetry of the laue pattern confirmed the cubic structure of this compound .",
    "the crystals were then cut along [ 100 ] by means of a spark erosion cutting machine for the magnetic property measurements .",

    "the estimated effective moment is close to the free ion value of ce , 2.54  @xmath18 in its trivalent state .",
