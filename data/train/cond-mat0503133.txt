    "over the past few years relevant progress has been made in the study of disordered elastic interfaces .",
    "one of the most intriguing problems concerns the response of the interface to an external force @xmath0 .",
    "two regimes are observed at zero temperature : ( i ) when @xmath0 is smaller than a certain critical threshold @xmath1 , the interface is pinned ; ( ii ) when the force @xmath0 passes the threshold value ( @xmath2 ) the system undergoes the so - called depinning transition @xcite , which has been widely investigated during the last years @xcite .",
    "the functional renormalization group has allowed to gain a much deeper understanding of this transition @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments on the contact line of a liquid meniscus on a rough substrate have also been analyzed @xcite .    in this context , we have introduced new algorithms which allow us to solve the depinning problem at zero temperature in finite samples . this paper discusses mathematical aspects of the variant monte carlo ( vmc ) algorithm , which have not been published yet , although they were implied in past works @xcite . in section [ vmc ]",
    ", we prove the no - passing theorem and the forward - moving property for the vmc algorithm , then in section [ pin ] we discuss in detail the single  pin problem .",
    "the vmc algorithm is able to detect the critical force and the critical configuration ( i.e. the ultimate pinned configuration ) of a one - dimensional string with short - range elasticity moving on a disordered two - dimensional lattice .",
    "we have also developed a continuous algorithm @xcite , which is remarkably useful in higher dimensions and allows to handle long - range interactions .",
    "we consider a string @xmath3 moving at times @xmath4 on a spatial square lattice of side @xmath5 , in a random potential @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the energy of the string is @xmath8 ,   \\label{energy}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the external driving force and @xmath9 a short - range convex elastic energy .",
    "we assume toroidal boundary conditions with a winding term for @xmath0 such that , at large @xmath0 , the line keeps winding around the torus , lowering the energy at each time step . in section [ pin ] , we show that a non - local algorithm needs to be used allowing an arbitrary number of points @xmath10 to move simultaneously by one site in any direction @xcite .    following ref .",
    "@xcite we define a front of length @xmath11 as a contiguous set of points @xmath12 which move together in forward direction .",
    "a front is defined similarly .",
    "a front is if moving it lowers the energy ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "one has to check only @xmath13 fronts to establish whether a string is pinned , ie has no unstable front .",
    "the force @xmath14 of a string @xmath15 is the smallest non - negative @xmath0 which destabilizes one of its forward fronts .",
    "the force of a whole sample can then be defined as the largest of the depinning forces of all the strings in the sample @xmath16 the vmc algorithm simply moves a single front of _ minimal _ length @xmath11 among the unstable forward and backward fronts .",
    "the vmc algorithm is not a valid monte carlo algorithm .",
    "however , each possible move within the vmc algorithm is also allowed with all the non - local algorithms , and its depinning threshold and ultimate pinned configuration is the same as the one of each non - local algorithm . we will show that the above definition of @xmath1 is appropriate for the vmc algorithm .",
    "this implies that it is also correct for general non - local rules , even if they are not restricted to moving fronts only ( @xcite ) .",
    "we stress that these definitions and the following theorems can be easily extended to a general @xmath17-dimensional interface with a convex elastic energy",
    ". however , the vmc seems to be practically useful only for one - dimensional interfaces with short - range elastic energy as the total number of fronts remains polynomial .",
    "we prove the following theorems :        let @xmath15 be a stable configuration . then the vmc algorithm can not reach a configuration @xmath18 with @xmath19 for some @xmath10 from a starting configuration @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "[ theorem_one ]    this theorem is illustrated in figure  [ due](@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "we suppose the existence of a string @xmath18 forbidden by the theorem ( see figure [ due]@xmath23 ) : @xmath25 due to the definition of the vmc dynamics the front connecting @xmath20 to @xmath26 ( see figure [ due]@xmath24 ) must be stable .",
    "moreover , the stability of @xmath15 assures that the front connecting @xmath15 to @xmath27 ( see figure [ due]@xmath17 ) is also stable : @xmath28 subtracting eq .",
    "( [ absurdeii]_i _ ) from the equations ( [ dynamiqueconditionii ] ) and using the expression ( [ energy ] ) leads to @xmath29 where , without any loss of generality , we set @xmath30 ( see figure [ due]@xmath22 ) . from @xmath31",
    "we write : @xmath32 a convex function @xmath33 in @xmath34 $ ] satisfies for all @xmath35 $ ] : @xmath36 taking @xmath37 and @xmath38 , from ( [ finalconditionii ] ) we can find a @xmath39 such that : @xmath40 using this relation to impose the convexity of the elastic energy in ( [ finalcondition ] ) we end up with a contradiction which demonstrates the theorem .",
    "let @xmath15 be pinned in forward direction .",
    "then , the vmc algorithm can at most recede towards a string @xmath20 ( @xmath41 ) , which is itself pinned in forward direction .",
    "the analogous property holds for strings pinned in backward direction .",
    "[ theorem_two ]    an illustration of this theorem is displayed in figure [ due](@xmath42 , @xmath0 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "we suppose that a configuration @xmath18 , forbidden by the theorem , is reached by the string : @xmath45 the instability of the front connecting @xmath15 to @xmath20 ( figure [ due]@xmath42 ) implies @xmath46 we may connect the string @xmath15 to the string @xmath18 by moving two fronts ( see figure [ due]@xmath43 ) .",
    "we have also to consider the case shown in figure [ due ] @xmath44 , where we suppose that the line starting from @xmath20 moves to @xmath47 instead of @xmath18 . using the convexity condition ( [ convexityi ] ) the theorem remains valid . ]",
    "the forward front is stable because @xmath15 is pinned in forward direction .",
    "the backward front is also stable because it is smaller than the front connecting @xmath15 to @xmath20 ( vmc dynamics ) .",
    "thus we conclude : @xmath48 eq .",
    "[ vmcconditioni ] contradicts the sum of ( [ absurdei ] _ i _ ) and ( [ dynamiqueconditioni ] ) , invalidating the starting hypothesis and proving the theorem .",
    "the -passing theorem ( theorem [ theorem_one ] ) assures that the vmc algorithm connects an arbitrary initial state with the critical string , whereas the -moving theorem ( theorem [ theorem_two ] ) allows us to understand that eq .",
    "( [ fcrit ] ) is indeed appropriate : one might have imagined that the elastic line which can not advance at @xmath1 could move backwards and then be avoided during the subsequent forward evolution .",
    "theorem [ theorem_two ] excludes the existence of such loopholes .",
    "finally we remark that both theorems transpose correctly to the lattice the analytical properties of the continuum equation of motion @xcite .",
    ". , width=10 ]",
    "we now discuss the motion both of a continuous and a discrete elastic line .",
    "the line is pinned at a single point which corresponds , with periodic boundary conditions , to @xmath49 .",
    "the equation of motion for the continuous line is @xmath50 a discrete _ harmonic _ elastic energy @xmath51 then corresponds to the continuous energy @xmath52 , to be integrated over @xmath53 .",
    "the stationary solution under the indicated pinning condition is easily seen to be @xmath54 , as shown in figure  [ single ] for @xmath55 .",
    "we may also follow the dynamics of the discretized problem from a starting configuration @xmath56 .",
    "of particular interest is the case @xmath57 , with @xmath58 .",
    "the vmc solutions are given in the figure .",
    "they have to be contrasted with the solutions of the local algorithm ( only fronts of length @xmath59 can be moved ) . for @xmath60 , the starting configuration is stable under local dynamics , as any forward move of a single point costs an elastic energy @xmath59 , more than what is recovered through the driving force .",
    "the vmc solution is recovered only for @xmath61 this specific force @xmath62 of the local algorithm is independent of @xmath5 only for the harmonic elastic energy .",
    "the local algorithm is more pathological for stronger than harmonic elastic energies , which have proven to be important in this context @xcite .",
    "this is evident in the metric constraint model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as an example ( stronger than harmonic , weaker than metric constraint ) we treat a quartic elastic energy @xmath63 ( corresponding to a continuous energy @xmath64 ) .",
    "the stationary continuum solution of eq.[continuum ] : @xmath65 $ ] , is again recovered with the vmc algorithm . however , the specific critical force at which the local algorithm becomes equivalent to the vmc method grows with @xmath5 as @xmath66 , _ i.e. _ diverges with @xmath5 .",
    "we conclude that the local dynamics is inconsistent even for a single - pin problem . in general disordered samples",
    ", it similarly fails to describe the real dynamics of the continuum and is very sensitive to exceptional ( local ) configurations of the disorder potential , which can block the string even of an infinite systems , and eliminate the interplay between disorder and ( collective ) elasticity which is at the heart of the depinning problem ."
