    "<S> sabs of the superfluid @xmath0he b phase can be regarded as majorana fermions as they satisfy the majorana condition , i.e. , a particle and its antiparticle are equivalent , because the degrees of freedom of the bound states are halved . when a surface is specular , </S>",
    "<S> linear dispersions are predicted for majorana fermions@xcite , which have been recently referred to as a majorana cone@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the transverse acoustic impedance @xmath1 of the superfluid @xmath0he b phase changing its boundary condition up to practically specular scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the observed variation of @xmath1 is well reproduced by theoretical analysis and is shown to be induced by the formation of the cone - like dispersion relation of sabs at higher specularities . </S>",
    "<S> this provides an evidence of the existence of the majorana cone in superfluid @xmath2he b in the specular limit .    </S>",
    "<S> superfluid @xmath0he is a well established spin - triplet p - wave superfluid where the b phase is the realization of the balian - werthamer state , which breaks the relative spin - orbit symmetry@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the surface majorana states of the @xmath0he b phase should exhibit peculiar features such as a surface spin current and an anisotropic magnetic response@xcite . under the specular scattering boundary condition of the surface , sabs with a finite energy are not degenerate , and have a dispersion relation linear to the momentum , which takes the shape of a 2d cone for massless dirac fermions . in the spin - triplet p - wave pairing system , </S>",
    "<S> the annihilation operator of the negative energy state is equivalent to the creation operator of the positive energy state . </S>",
    "<S> hence , </S>",
    "<S> only the positive energy cone , which is called a majorana cone , is physical@xcite . to date </S>",
    "<S> , majorana surface fermion states have been discussed mostly on smooth surfaces ( specular scattering limit ) . however , intriguing problems are to elucidate how the majorana cone transforms as the roughness of the walls increases ( or the specularity @xmath3 decreases ) and how this transformation affects the experimental observations .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is a parameter introduced to specify the boundary condition for quasiparticle scattering . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 corresponds to the specular scattering limit where quasiparticles conserve the parallel component of the momentum and only the perpendicular component is inverted after scattering off a wall . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath5 is the diffusive limit where quasiparticles are scattered in random directions . for a partially specular scattering condition @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> a fraction @xmath3 of the quasiparticles is specularly scattered , while the remaining fraction @xmath7 is scattered diffusely@xcite . in liquid </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2he , @xmath3 can be controlled _ in situ _ by coating the wall with thin layers of @xmath8he@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8he atoms are selectively adsorbed onto the walls due to their larger mass and reduce the roughness of the wall .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1a shows a theoretical calculation@xcite for the angle averaged surface density of states ( sdos ) @xmath9 for the b phase at various @xmath3 . in the diffusive limit where @xmath5 , a nearly flat sabs band with a very sharp edge at @xmath10 appears below the bulk superfluid gap @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of @xmath10 was theoretically predicted many years ago@xcite . as @xmath3 increases , the edge @xmath10 increases and the low - energy spectral weight shifts toward the band edge forming a peak structure just below @xmath10 . for the specular limit where @xmath4 , sdos increases linearly with energy at low energy : @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this linear energy dependence reflects the linear dispersion of sabs or the majorana cone . as is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b , the density of states at zero energy @xmath13 decreases rapidly as @xmath3 increases .    </S>",
    "<S> we measured the temperature dependence of the transverse acoustic impedance @xmath14 of the superfluid @xmath0he b phase at various @xmath3 values using ac - cut quartz transducers immersed in liquid @xmath0he . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the wall corresponds to the surface of the transducer . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is a complex quantity defined as the ratio of the shear stress @xmath16 of the liquid at the wall to the oscillation velocity @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath1 can be obtained from the change in the resonance angular frequency @xmath19 and the quality factor @xmath20 of the quartz transducers , @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the measured angular frequency , @xmath23 is the acoustic impedance of the quartz transducer and @xmath24 is the harmonics number@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is determined independently by measuring @xmath14 in a normal fluid with @xmath25he coating . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of @xmath1 is largest for pure @xmath0he without coating , where the boundary condition is supposed to be at the diffusive limit @xmath5 . the temperature dependence becomes smaller in the sample with @xmath8he coating due to the reduced transverse momentum exchange and @xmath26 at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 can be obtained by fitting @xmath14 with the fermi liquid theory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> details of the experimental procedure have already been reported@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated in earlier publications that @xmath1 is a unique surface probe for sabs in superfluid @xmath0he and have provided the spectroscopic details of sdos@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 presents the measured @xmath14 as a function of the normalized energy @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 is the superfluid gap energy at @xmath29 obtained from the weak - coupling - plus model@xcite ; thus , a higher ( lower ) energy corresponds to a higher ( lower ) temperature . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 is the normal state value of @xmath1 just above the transition temperature @xmath31 . to view data at various @xmath3 on the same scale , </S>",
    "<S> the vertical axis is the difference from the normal state value @xmath32 scaled by @xmath33 .    in a pure @xmath2he system without @xmath25he coating , </S>",
    "<S> the boundary condition is supposed to be fully diffusive , i.e. , @xmath5 . in this system , we found a kink in the real part @xmath34 of the impedance and a peak in the imaginary part @xmath35 at a higher frequency , which are indicated by the downward arrows in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2@xcite . theoretical analysis showed that these singularities are due to pair excitations of a sabs quasiparticle and a propagating bogolubov quasiparticle@xcite with frequency @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the kink structure in the real part @xmath34 is well reproduced by a joint density of states @xmath37 where @xmath9 is the sdos shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . in the system with @xmath25he coating , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 increases in accordance with theory@xcite .    in partially specular cases , </S>",
    "<S> new peaks grow in the low - energy region as @xmath3 increases@xcite , which are indicated by the upward arrows in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . at the highest specularity @xmath38 we have achieved to date , </S>",
    "<S> the peaks become very distinctive . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical calculation reproduces the growth of the low - energy peak at higher @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows the theoretical results of the frequency dependence of @xmath1 for various values of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation was performed in the same manner as refs . and .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the origin of the new peak in partially specular cases . </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig . 4a - e the angle resolved sdos at various @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are plotted as functions of the parallel component of the momentum @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the incident angle of the quasiparticle measured from the surface normal and @xmath41 is the fermi momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the circles in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4a - e indicate the peak positions in the spectra , and are plotted altogether in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4f . </S>",
    "<S> although the peak position is insignificant due to the very broad spectrum at @xmath5 , we plotted the maximum positions at every @xmath3 . at @xmath5 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a ) , states below @xmath10 appear for all incident angles@xcite and a cone - like structure is not recognized in the broad spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , even at a relatively small specularity @xmath42 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b ) , the zero - energy weight is significantly suppressed , except around the normal incidence @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> a cone - like structure is formed in this case , but the peak positions are still below the linear dependence , as found in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4f . at @xmath44 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4c ) , which is within the range of the experiment , a rather sharp cone is recognized and the peak positions follow a nearly linear dependence @xmath45 with @xmath46 cm / s as in the specular limit @xmath4 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4f ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the majorana cone like structure is realized at higher specularities .    </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that @xmath1 in low - energy region is dominated by the scattering of the thermally excited quasiparticles@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy peak in @xmath1 begins to grow at @xmath47 ( dot - dashed lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) as @xmath48 increases . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath49 corresponds to the energy difference between the band edge and the propagating bogoliubov states with @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the growth in @xmath1 is a clear sign of the inelastic scattering of quasiparticles from the thermally occupied sabs around the sdos maximum to the propagating bogoliubov states . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 falls around @xmath51 , since the low - energy sdos is suppressed by the formation of the majorana cone . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the diffusive limit ( @xmath5 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . since the sdos in the diffusive limit remains finite down to zero energy , no double peak structure is found . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of the low - energy peak is a distinct evidence of the formation of the surface majorana cone .    in summary , the growth of low - energy peaks in the transverse acoustic impedance is observed in a topological superfluid , the superfluid @xmath0he - b phase . </S>",
    "<S> this growth is reproduced theoretically by a self - consistent calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion of sabs is calculated for various boundary conditions and a cone - like structure is clearly observed even on a partially specular wall . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed growth of the peaks is due to the formation of a surface majorana cone on a higher specularity wall , and is a strong indicator of the predicted majorana cone in the specular limit . </S>",
    "<S> transverse acoustic impedance measurement is a promising technique for studying surface states and will provide more direct proof of the majorana nature as the anisotropic magnetic response of the majorana cone@xcite . </S>"
