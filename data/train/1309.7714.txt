    "to date , more than 800 exoplanets have been discovered via several different methods .",
    "most of the exoplanets have been discovered with the radial velocity @xcite and transit methods @xcite .",
    "these methods are most sensitive to planets in very close orbits , and as a result , our understanding of the properties of exoplanetary systems is dominated by planets in close orbits . while the number of exoplanet discoveries by microlensing is relatively small ( 18 discoveries to date ) @xcite , microlensing is sensitive to planets beyond the  snow - line \" at @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath5 is the mass of the host star .",
    "this region beyond the  snow - line \" is thought to be the dominant exoplanet birthplace , and microlensing is able to find planets down to an earth - mass @xcite in this region .",
    "microlensing does not depend on the detection of any light from the exoplanet host stars , so planets orbiting faint hosts , like brown dwarfs and m - dwarfs @xcite , can be detected .",
    "microlensing is one of several methods that has contributed to our statistical understanding of the exoplanet distribution . in other methods , @xcite analyzed on 8 years of radial velocity measurements to constraint the frequency of the jupiter - mass planets ( 0.3 - 10 @xmath6 ) with orbital periods of less than 2000 days , and found that less than 10.5% of the stars in their sample had such planets .",
    "@xcite used a 12-year radial velocity sample to search for jupiter analogs , and found that between 3.3% and 37.2 % of the stars in their sample had such a planet with a planet .",
    "when it comes to the transit method , @xcite reported the distribution of planets as a function of planet radius , orbital period , and stellar effective temperature for orbital periods less than 50 days around solar - type stars .",
    "they measured an occurrence of @xmath7 planets per star for planets with radii @xmath8 .",
    "microlensing has already demonstrated the ability to find both jupiter and saturn - analog planets with the discovery of the jupiter / saturn analog system , ogle-2006-blg-109lb , c @xcite .",
    "there have been several recent papers that have looked at the statistical implications of the microlensing exoplanet discoveries .",
    "@xcite determined the slope of the exoplanet mass function beyond the snow line , and found that the cold neptunes are @xmath9 times more common than jupiters .",
    "( the 95% confidence level limit is more than three times more common . )",
    "@xcite used six microlensing discoveries to show that low - mass gas giant planets are quite common beyond the snow line of low - mass stars at a level that is consistent with an extrapolation of the @xcite radial velocity results .",
    "most recently , @xcite estimated the fraction of bound planets at separations of 0.5 - 10 au with a somewhat larger microlensing sample .",
    "they found that @xmath10 % of stars host jupiter - mass planets , while @xmath11 % and @xmath12 % of stars host neptune - mass planets ( 10 - 30 @xmath13 ) and super - earths ( 5 - 10 @xmath13 ) , respectively .    in this paper",
    ", we present the analysis of the planetary microlensing event moa-2010-blg-328 . section [ sec : observations ] describes the observation of the event , and the light curve modeling is presented in section [ sec : modeling ] .",
    "the light curve shows evidence of orbital motion of either the earth , known as microlensing parallax , or of the source stars , which is often referred to as the xallarap effect .",
    "these two possibilities have very different implications for the properties of the host star and its planet .",
    "however , we need the angular radius of the source star to work out the implications for the star plus planet lens system , so we determine the source star angular radius in section [ sec : source ] . in section [ sec : lens ] , we present the implications for the properties of the host star and its planet for both the parallax and xallarap solutions .",
    "while the data do prefer the parallax solution , the xallarap model is not completely excluded . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we describe how future follow - up observations can distinguish between these two solutions , and give our conclusions .",
    "several groups search for exoplanets using the microlensing method , using two different observing modes : wide field - of - view ( fov ) surveys , and narrow fov follow - up observations .",
    "the microlensing surveys active in 2010 were the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) group and the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ; * ? ? ?",
    "moa uses the 1.8 m moa - ii telescope equipped with the 10k @xmath14 8k - pixel ccd camera moa - cam3 @xcite with a 2.2 deg@xmath15 fov to monitor @xmath16 44 deg@xmath15 of the galactic bulge with a cadence of one observation of each field every 15 - 95 minutes depending on the field .",
    "moa identifies microlensing events in real time @xcite , and announced 607 microlensing alerts in 2010 . in 2010 , the ogle collaboration initiated the ogle - iv survey , after upgrading their ccd camera from the ogle - iii system which operated from 2001 - 2009 .",
    "ogle observations are conducted with 1.3 m warsaw telescope at las campanas observatory , chile .",
    "the ogle - iv survey employs a 1.4 deg@xmath15 , 256 mega pixel , 32 chip ccd mosaic camera to survey an even larger area of the galactic bulge at cadences ranging from one observation every 20 minutes to less than one observation per day .",
    "the ogle real - time event detection system , known as the early warning system ( ews ) @xcite , was not operational in 2010 .",
    "the follow - up groups employ narrow fov telescopes spread across the world ( mostly in the southern hemisphere ) for high cadence photometric monitoring of a subset of microlensing events found by the survey groups . generally , the events observed by the follow - up groups are events with a high planet detection sensitivity @xcite or events in which a candidate planetary signal has been seen .",
    "follow - up groups include the microlensing follow - up network ( @xmath17fun ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , robonet @xcite , and the probing lensing anomalies network ( planet ; * ? ? ?",
    "because the planetary deviations are short , with durations ranging from a few hours to a few days , high cadence observations from observatories widely spaced in longitude are needed to provide good sampling .    the microlensing event moa-2010-blg-328 ( r.a . ,",

    "the moa observer noticed a few data points at hjd @xmath16 5402 that were above the prediction of the single lens light curve model , but waited for the next observations , three days later , for the significance of the deviation to reach the threshold to issue an anomaly alert .",
    "this anomaly alert was issued to the other microlensing groups at ut 11:30 27 july ( hjd @xmath16 5405 ) .",
    "one day later , moa circulated a preliminary planetary model , and shortly thereafter , observations were begun by the follow - up groups .",
    "follow - up data was obtained from the @xmath17fun , planet , mindstep , and robonet groups .",
    "@xmath17fun obtained data from the ctio 1.3 m telescope in chile in the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26-bands , the palomar observatory 1.5 m telescope in usa in the @xmath24-band , and the farm cove observatory 0.36 m in new zealand in unfiltered pass band .",
    "@xmath17fun also obtained data from auckland observatory , kumeu observatory , and possum observatory , all in new zealand ; unfortunately , they obtained only one night of observations , so these data are not used in the analysis .",
    "the data sets from planet consist of @xmath25 and @xmath24-band data from saao 1.0 m telescope in south africa , and @xmath24-band data from the canopus observatory 1.0 m telescope in australia .",
    "robonet provided data from the faulkes telescope north 2.0 m in hawaii in the @xmath25 and @xmath24-bands , the faulkes telescope south 2.0 m in australia in the @xmath24-band , and the liverpool telescope 2.0 m in canary islands in the @xmath24-band .",
    "the mindstep group provided data from the danish 1.54 m telescope at eso la silla in chile in the @xmath24-band .",
    "moa s observations were done in the wide moa - red band , which is approximately equivalent to @xmath27 , and the observations during the main peak of the planetary deviation were taken at a cadence of about one image every 10 minutes , or 4 - 5 times higher than the normal observing cadence due to a high magnification event in the same field and the detection of the anomaly in this event .",
    "due to poor weather at the mt .",
    "john university observatory , where the moa telescope is located , the planetary signal was recognized and announced after it was already nearing the second peak , so the light curve coverage from the follow - up groups is poor .",
    "fortunately , much of the early part of the planetary deviation was monitored by the ogle - iv survey ( in the @xmath24-band ) , and so we have good coverage of most of the planetary deviation from the moa and ogle surveys .",
    "most of the photometry was done by the standard difference imaging photometry method for each group .",
    "the moa data were reduced with the moa difference image analysis ( dia ) pipeline @xcite , and the ogle data were reduced with the ogle dia photometry pipeline @xcite .",
    "the photometry of @xmath17fun and planet was performed with the planet group s pysys @xcite difference imaging code .",
    "the robonet data were reduced with dandia @xcite , and the mindstep data were reduced with diapl @xcite .",
    "the ctio @xmath25 and @xmath24-band data were also reduced with dophot @xcite in order to get photometry of the lensed source on the same scale as photometry of the non - variable bright stars in the frame .",
    "since there were only two observations from the faulkes telescope south , we have not included these data in our modeling .",
    "finally , we did not use moa data of before 2009 , because there appeared to be some systematic errors in the early baseline observations .",
    "the datasets used for the modeling are summarized in table [ tab : dataset ] .",
    "the error bars provided by these photometry codes are generally good estimates of the relative error bars for the different data points , but they often provide only a rough estimate of the absolute uncertainty for each photometric measurement .",
    "therefore , we follow the standard practices of renormalizing the error bars to give @xmath28 for each data set once a reasonable model has been found . in this case , we have used the best parallax plus orbital model ( see section [ sec : parallax ] ) for this error bar renormalization .",
    "this procedure ensures that the error bars for the microlensing fit parameters are calculated correctly .",
    "we carefully examined the property of residual distribution weighted by the normalized errors .",
    "we confirmed that it is well represented by the gaussian distribution with the sigma of close to unity , @xmath29 , where kolmogorov - smirnov probability is 4.8% and 6.9% for the unconstrained xallarap model and parallax+orbital model , respectively ( see next section ) .",
    "the best fit sigma of @xmath29 is slightly smaller than unity due to compensating the excess points in the tails of the residual distribution .",
    "the number of these excess points with more than 3@xmath30 is not so large , @xmath160.9 % , compared to formally expected fraction of 0.27% .",
    "furthermore , they are sparsely distributed all over the light curve , i.e. , not clustered at any particular place .",
    "we also found that they are not correlated with seeing .",
    "there is only a weak correlation with airmass of @xmath160.1 @xmath30/airmass which is too small to explain the excess tails .",
    "so we concluded that it is unlikely that they bias our result significantly .",
    "thus the effect of this small deviation from gaussian was not tested in this work by more thorough analysis , like a bootstrap method .",
    "the parameters used for the standard binary lens modeling in this paper are the time of closest approach to the barycenter of lens , @xmath31 , the einstein radius crossing time , @xmath32 , the impact parameter in units of the einstein radius , @xmath33 , the planet - host mass ratio , @xmath34 , the lens separation in the einstein radius units , @xmath35 , the angle of the source trajectory with respect to the binary axis , @xmath36 , and the angular source radius ( @xmath37 ) normalized by the angular einstein radius , @xmath38 .",
    "the angular einstein radius @xmath39 is expressed as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , and @xmath5 is the total mass of the lens system .",
    "@xmath42 is the lens - source relative parallax given by @xmath43 , where the @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the parallax of the lens and that of the source , respectively .",
    "@xmath46 is the distance to the lens , and @xmath47 is that to the source .",
    "first , we searched the standard model that minimizes @xmath48 with using the above parameters .",
    "we used the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method to obtain the @xmath49 minimum .",
    "light curve calculations were done using a variation of the method of @xcite .",
    "the initial parameter - sets to search the standard model were used over the wide range , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the total number of initial parameter - sets was 858 , and all parameters were free parameters .",
    "we thereby found that the standard model showed @xmath52 , and the parameters are listed in table [ tab : parameter ] .",
    "the caustic exit is well observed in this event , and this implies that finite source effects must be important , because caustic crossings imply singularities in light curves for point sources .",
    "we must therefore account for limb darkening when modeling this event .",
    "we use a linear limb - darkening model in which the source surface brightness is expressed as @xmath53 \\ .\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath54 is the limb - darkening coefficient , @xmath55 is the central surface brightness of the source , and the @xmath56 is the angle between the normal to the stellar surface and the line of the sight . as discussed in section [ sec : source ] , the estimated intrinsic source color is @xmath57 , and its angular radius is @xmath58as .",
    "this implies that the source is mid - late g - type turn - off star . from the source color",
    ", we estimate an effective temperature , @xmath59 k according to @xcite , adopting @xmath60 = 0 $ ] .",
    "assuming @xmath61 , @xcite gives the limb - darkening coefficients for a @xmath62 k star of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath66-bands , respectively .",
    "we used the average of @xmath24 and @xmath66-band coefficient for moa - red wide band and @xmath66-band coefficient for unfiltered bands .",
    "the orbital motion of the earth during the event implies that the lens does not appear to move at a constant velocity with respect to the source , as seen by earth - bound observers .",
    "this is known as the ( orbital ) microlensing parallax effect , and it can often be detected for events with time scales @xmath67days , like moa-2010-blg-328 .",
    "so , we have included this effect in our modeling .",
    "this requires two additional parameters , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which are the two components of the microlensing parallax vector @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the microlensing parallax amplitude is given by @xmath71 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath72 is also described as @xmath73 .",
    "the direction of @xmath70 is that of the lens - source relative proper motion at a fixed reference time of hjd=2455379.0 which is near the peak of event . if both @xmath74 and @xmath72 are measured , one can determine the mass of the lens system , @xmath75 assuming one also has an estimate of @xmath37 , the angular source radius .",
    "since the source distance , @xmath76 , is approximately known , we can also estimate the lens distance from @xmath77    the parallax model parameters are shown in table [ tab : parameter ] , and as this table indicates , inclusion of the parallax parameters improves @xmath49 by @xmath78 .",
    "when the parallax effect is relatively weak , there is an approximate symmetry in which the lens plane is replaced by its mirror image ( i.e.  @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) .",
    "however , for this event , this symmetry is broken as the @xmath81 solution yields a @xmath49 smaller than the @xmath82 solution by @xmath83 .",
    "another higher order effect that is always present is the orbital motion of the lens system .",
    "this causes the shape and position of the caustic curves to change with time .",
    "the microlensing signal of the planet can be seen for only @xmath84days , which is much smaller than the likely orbital period of @xmath85years , so it is sensible to consider the lowest order components of orbital motion , the two - dimensional relative velocity in the plane of the sky .",
    "to lowest order , orbital motion can be expressed by velocity components in polar coordinates , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "these are the binary rotation rate and the binary separation velocity @xcite .",
    "( note that this would be a poor choice of variables in cases ( e.g. , @xcite ) where the binary acceleration is important , because polar coordinates are not inertial . )",
    "when written in the ( rotating ) lens coordinate system , the source trajectory takes the form @xmath88    we have conducted fits with both orbital motion alone and with microlensing parallax plus orbital motion , and the best fit parameters for each model are given in table [ tab : parameter ] . figure [ fig : lightcurve ] presents the light curve of the best parallax plus orbital motion model , and figure [ fig : caustic ] shows its caustic .",
    "this table indicates that the orbital motion only model improves @xmath48 by @xmath89 vs.  the standard model , which is slightly worse than the @xmath48 improvement of @xmath90 for the parallax only model . the combined parallax and orbital motion model yield a @xmath48 improvement of @xmath91 .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : parameter ] , we found that the @xmath92 model showed smaller @xmath48 than the @xmath93 models for the parallax plus orbital motion model , but the difference between @xmath48 of the @xmath92 model and that of the @xmath93 model is small ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this is due to the degeneracy of @xmath95 with @xmath86 @xcite , where @xmath95 is the component of @xmath70 that is perpendicular to the instantaneous direction of the earth s acceleration .",
    "compared to the @xmath93 model , the @xmath92 model is preferred by @xmath94 but the @xmath93 model can not be excluded .",
    "since both orbital motion and microlensing parallax should exist at some level in every binary microlensing light curve , the parallax plus orbital motion model should be considered more realistic than the orbital motion only model .",
    "however , it is important to check that the parameters of the orbital motion models are consistent with the allowed velocities for bound orbits , since the probability of finding planets in unbound orbits is extremely small .",
    "so we would like to be able to compare the transverse kinetic energy , @xmath96 , with the potential energy , @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "then , the ratio of kinetic to potential energy can be expressed in terms of observables as @xmath98 where @xmath99 consists of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the parameters of the parallax plus orbital motion model indicate that these ratio are 0.72 and 0.08 for the @xmath102 and @xmath103 model , respectively , and this implies that the both models are reasonable .",
    "the xallarap effect is the converse of the parallax effect .",
    "it is due to the orbital motion of the source instead of the orbital motion of the observers on the earth .",
    "xallarap can cause similar light curve distortions to the parallax effect @xcite . unlike parallax and orbital motion",
    ", however , there is a good chance that the source will not have a companion with an orbital period in the right range to give a detectable xallarap signal . only about 10% of source stars have a companion with orbital parameters that would allow a xallarap solution that could mimic microlensing parallax .    for the xallarap model , the xallarap vector , ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) , which correspond to ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) , the direction of observer relative to the source orbital axis , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the orbital period , @xmath108 , the orbital eccentricity , @xmath109 , and the time of periastron , @xmath110 ,",
    "are required in addition to the standard binary model .",
    "the xallarap amplitude , @xmath111 , is expressed with kepler s third law as follows @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the semimajor axis of the source orbit and , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the masses of the source and its companion , respectively .",
    "the @xmath116 is the einstein radius projected on the source plane and is described as follows @xmath117 assuming values for the two masses @xmath114 and @xmath115 , we can determine the @xmath111 for a given period @xmath108 , and then we can constrain the @xmath111 value in the xallarap model .",
    "we conducted the xallarap modeling with constraint and without constraint .",
    "for the constrained xallarap model , we assumed @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and various masses of companion , @xmath115 , from @xmath120 to @xmath121 . here",
    "the upper limit of the companion mass is due to the measured blending flux as shown in section [ sec : constrainedxallarap ] .",
    "the parameters obtained for each models are listed in table [ tab : parameter ] . at this time",
    ", we ignored the orbital motion of the companion of the lens .",
    "the best unconstrained and constrained xallarap models ( fixed with @xmath122 ) have nearly identical @xmath48 , i.e. , 5652 and 5653 , respectively .",
    "they gave improved with @xmath123 compared with the standard model and @xmath124 , @xmath125 compared with the parallax plus orbital motion model .",
    "figure [ fig : chi2 ] shows the @xmath49 distribution as a function of @xmath108 . in figure",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] , the orbital eccentricity , @xmath109 , was fixed as the value for earth .",
    "only the result with companion mass @xmath126 shows worse @xmath49 than the parallax only model for every @xmath108 .",
    "therefore we estimated the probability of the existence of the companion with @xmath127 and @xmath128 , whose @xmath49 were smaller than parallax model , and found that the prior probability was about 3 % @xcite .    as mentioned earlier in this section",
    ", the xallarap signal can mimic the microlening parallax .",
    "if the parallax signal is real , the xallarap parameters should converge on the earth values . to check whether the parallax is real , we verify the parameters of the unconstrained xallarap model .",
    "this is because if the parallax model is correct , the xallarap parameter , @xmath111 , does not represent a real companion , so it can be anything . focusing on the period , @xmath108 ,",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : chi2 ] , the period is consistent with @xmath129 .",
    "note that the lens orbital motion is ignored in figure [ fig : chi2 ] .",
    "then we checked the consistency of the @xmath106 and @xmath107 . to check this",
    ", we conducted the xallarap modeling with @xmath106 and @xmath107 fixed at grid of values . during this test",
    ", we fixed the eccentricity and period with the earth s values and included the lens orbital motion , i.e. , @xmath86 , @xmath87 . the @xmath48 map in the @xmath130-@xmath131 plane is shown in figure [ fig : map ] .",
    "the best xallarap model has ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) = ( 280 , -25 ) that is close to the coordinate of the event ( @xmath132 = 269@xmath21 , @xmath133 = -31@xmath21 ) .",
    "the @xmath134 between best xallarap model and nearby coordinate of the event ( @xmath132 = 270@xmath21 , @xmath133 = -30@xmath21 ) is small ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "the results of the verification of the consistency of the period and coordinate support that the xallarap parameters are consistent with the earth parameters . as mentioned before ,",
    "the prior probability that the source has a companion with the required mass / period parameters is small ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "now , even if it did have these parameters , the chance that the orientation of the orbit would mimic that of the earth s to the degree shown in figure 4 is only about 0.6% . combining these two factors yields a prior probability , @xmath137 , of only @xmath138 . on the other hand",
    ", we also estimated a prior probability that the lens would be at 0.81 kpc ( as derived from the parallax solution ) , @xmath139 , at 2.5% .",
    "this is 2@xmath30 value of the mcmc chain of the parallax plus orbital motion .",
    "note that the distribution of the error is not a gaussian . comparing both prior probabilities ,",
    "the parallax is preferred by a factor of @xmath140 .",
    "moreover we found that the probability of getting the observed improvement in @xmath134 with the xallarap model for additional degrees of freedom , @xmath141 , was about 0.1 . even if we consider this probability , the parallax solution is still preferred a factor of @xmath142 .",
    "nevertheless , the prior probability that the lens would be at 0.81 or 1.24 kpc ( as derived from the parallax solution ) is also relatively low , so the xallarap model needs to be considered carefully .",
    "we therefore estimated the physical parameters of the lens each for the parallax plus orbital motion model and for the constrained xallarap model by a bayesian analysis with using @xmath32 and @xmath39 .",
    "we derive the source star angular radius , @xmath143 , in order to obtain the angular einstein radius , @xmath39 . the model - independent source color is derived from @xmath25 and @xmath24-band photometry of ctio using linear regression , and the observed magnitude of the source is determined from ogle @xmath24-band with modeling . however , these are affected by interstellar dust .",
    "this means that we need to estimate the intrinsic source color and magnitude .",
    "therefore we use the red clump giants ( rcg ) , which are known to be approximate standard candles .",
    "we adopt the intrinsic rcg color @xmath144 @xcite and the magnitude @xmath145 @xcite , @xmath146    we construct two color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) : one is constructed of the ogle - iii catalog and the other is constructed of the instrumental ctio photometry .",
    "the cmd of ogle - iii is used for the calibration of the @xmath24-band magnitude , and the cmd of ctio is used for the calibration of the color .",
    "figure [ fig : cmd ] shows the cmd constructed of the ogle - iii catalog . from the cmd , the @xmath24-band magnitude of the rcg centroid is estimated to be @xmath147 . by comparing the intrinsic rcg and observed one ,",
    "we find that the offset is @xmath148 .",
    "applying this offset to the observed @xmath24-band magnitude of the source , @xmath149 ( @xmath92 model ) , we obtain the intrinsic @xmath24-band magnitude of the source , @xmath150 .",
    "likewise , we estimate that the instrumental color of the rcg centroid of ctio cmd is @xmath151 .",
    "the color offset of rcg between the intrinsic and the observed value is @xmath152 . using this offset to calibrate the observed color of the source , @xmath153",
    ", we can get the intrinsic color of the source as @xmath57 .",
    "finally we find the intrinsic @xmath24-band magnitude and the color of the source is @xmath154 using color - color relation @xcite , we derive @xmath155 from @xmath156 , @xmath157 then , we apply the relation between @xmath158 and the stellar angular radius @xcite and estimate the source star angular radius , @xmath159 adopting same procedure for @xmath93 model , we derive @xmath160 .",
    "this source star angular radius is consistent with that obtained from @xmath92 model . these source star angular radii mean that the source star radius is 1.5 @xmath161 with assuming the source star locates in the galactic bulge ( @xmath16 8 kpc ) .",

    "we can obtain only the einstein angular radius , @xmath39 , from the finite source effect parameter , @xmath74 , in xallarap model .",
    "consequently , for a bayesian analysis , we combined equation ( [ eq : mass ] ) , ( [ eq - dl ] ) and @xmath39 , @xmath32 with the galactic model @xcite , and mass function .",
    "the mass function is based on @xcite table 3s model # 1 , but we apply a slight modification .",
    "@xcite assumed that stars that were initially above 1@xmath199 have evolved into stellar remnants .",
    "however we assume the fraction of stars with mass of above 1@xmath199 by reference to @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained spectra of 26 microlensed stars and found that 12 stars were old metal poor , and 14 stars were young metal rich stars .",
    "so we assume that the mass function is constructed both by old metal poor stars and young metal rich stars equally . from the isochrones of @xcite",

    "[ fig : bayesian ] , the distributions of the magnitude have two peaks .",
    "the right peak consists of nearby red ( low mass ) stars , and the left peak consists of far blue ( massive ) stars .",
    "the distance to the lens indicates the extinctions of @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 . according to these estimates , the apparent magnitudes of the host ( and lens ) star should be @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and @xmath216 mag .",
    "we report the analysis of the planetary microlensing event moa-2010-blg-328 .",
    "the higher order effect improved the @xmath49 and the constrained xallarap model yielded the smallest @xmath49 value .",
    "however the difference of the @xmath49 between the constrained xallarap and the parallax plus lens orbital motion model is small ( @xmath217 ) , and the xallarap has a high probability to mimic the parallax for this event .",

    "high angular resolution follow - up observations by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) or adaptive optics ( ao ) can be used to confirm if the parallax plus orbital motion model is correct observationally .",
    "if the ao or hst observations are conducted , they should resolve stars unrelated to the source and lens stars that are blended with the lens and source stars in seeing - limited ground - based images .",
    "this should allow the brightness of the combined lens and source stars to be determined . because we know the source brightness from the models , we can get the brightness of the lens by subtracting the brightness of the source from the brightness measured by the hst or ao observations .",
    "if the lens brightnesses derived from the parallax plus orbital motion model differ vastly from those derived from the xallarap model , we can confirm if the parallax plus orbital motion model is correct .",
    "as shown in section [ sec : lens ] , the probability distributions of lens brightnesses of xallarap model have two peaks .",
    "the brighter one consists of blue turn - off dwarf stars with about solar mass at the far side of the disk .",
    "the fainter one consists of late m dwarfs with @xmath231@xmath232 in the closer disk at 24 kpc . on the other hand ,",
    "the lens of the parallax plus orbital motion model is redder and closer than the stars in this fainter peak .",
    "so these models can be distinguished by the brightness measurements with multiple band .",
    "furthermore , if the observations with hst would be conducted after a few years , when the lens and source have separated far enough for their relative positions to be determined @xcite , we can know the direction of the lens - source motion",
    ". then we can confirm if the parallax plus orbital motion model is correct by comparing the observed direction of the lens - source motion to the parallax plus orbital motion prediction .",
