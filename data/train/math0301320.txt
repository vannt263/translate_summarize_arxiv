    "let us take a sufficiently small neighborhood of each double point of @xmath6 so that the intersection of the neighborhood and @xmath6 is of the ` shape x ' on the plane . then modify the interior of each neighborhood so that we get a knot @xmath0 which is isotopic to @xmath1 and regularly projected to @xmath6 . in this sense",
    ", a knot diagram can be ` almost planar ' , i.e. , it lies in the plane except for a sufficiently small neighborhood of each double point of the regular planar projection .",
    "tabulation of knots is usually done by listing knots using their diagrams of minimal numbers of crossings . in general ,",
    "such a minimal knot diagram is not unique within its isotopy class .",
    "can this nonuniqueness be fixed by considering some other quantities associated with knot diagrams ? in this paper , we study the number of overpasses of a minimal knot diagram .",
    "an immediate concern in this investigation is the relationship between the number of crossings and the number of overpasses of a knot diagram .",
    "as it turns out , the number of crossings can be estimated from below and above by that of overpasses if the number of crossings is minimal among all diagrams of the same knot type ( theorem 2.9 ) .    as an interesting consequence of this estimation of the minimal crossing number by the number of overpasses",
    ", we may put two nice and relatively well understood classes of knots , that of alternating knots and that of @xmath7-torus knots , on the opposite extremes of a measurement of nonalternatingness of knot diagrams ( theorem 2.10 ) . under this measurement",
    ", we prove that the ` most nonalternating ' knot diagrams are exactly the standard minimal @xmath7-torus knot diagrams ( theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "notice that the minimal number of overpasses of a knot was the classical _ bridge number _ of a knot , first studied by schubert in @xcite , where the effect of various operations on knots ( satellite , cabling , connected sum ) on this number was investigated .    throughout this paper ,",
    "all knots are oriented and lie in the 3-dimensional sphere @xmath8 .",
    "also , all knots are tame , i.e. , they are isotopic to polygonal or smooth knots .",
    "hence , every knot has a diagram whose number of crossings is finite . for convenience ,",
    "we distinguish knot diagrams and knots . from now on ,",
    "a knot means an isotopy knot type @xmath9 $ ] for some knot diagram @xmath0 .",
    "we will refer the reader to textbooks of knot theory ( such as @xcite or @xcite ) for standard terminologies .",
    "also , we assume the _ well ordering property _ of the set @xmath10 of nonnegative integers to guarantee existence of the smallest element of any nonempty subset of @xmath10 .",
    "we would like to thank professor marek chrobak of the department of compute science and engineering at uc riverside for asking stimulating questions which led our inequality about the numbers @xmath2 and @xmath3 to its current optimal form .",
    "the number of crossings of a knot diagram @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath2 . for each knot @xmath1 , we denote @xmath11 _ is a diagram of _ @xmath12 by @xmath13",
    ". note that we may assume a knot diagram @xmath0 lies in the plane by indicating ` overcrossings ' and ` undercrossings ' .",
    "a ` crossing ' , in normal sense , of a knot diagram @xmath0 means a ` double point ' of the regular projection of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , @xmath2 is the number of all double points of the regular projection of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath14 is a crossing of a knot diagram @xmath0 , we denote the overcrossing and the undercrossing of @xmath0 projected to @xmath14 by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , where @xmath15 is above @xmath14 and @xmath16 is below @xmath14 .",
    "alternatively , we may regard a crossing of @xmath0 as a pair of two points , overcrossing and undercrossing , in @xmath0 which are projected to the same double point . in this case , a crossing is considered as the preimage of a double point under the projection map .",
    "let @xmath0 be a knot diagram with @xmath17 .",
    "then there is a unique positive integer @xmath18 such that there is a finite sequence @xmath19 of @xmath20 points of @xmath0 , each of which is neither an overcrossing nor an undercrossing of @xmath0 , such that @xmath21,[s_2,f_2], ... ,[s_{k-1},f_{k-1}],[s_k , f_k]\\ ] ] and @xmath22,[f_2,s_3], ...",

    "we may now repeat this procedure to take the other points @xmath41 until there is no overcrossing between @xmath42 and @xmath34 . since the number @xmath2 of crossings of @xmath0 is finite",
    ", @xmath18 must be finite . by its construction ,",
    "the sequence of points @xmath23 of @xmath0 is a one as stated in the proposition .",
    "uniqueness : suppose that @xmath43 is a positive integer and @xmath44 is a sequence of @xmath0 as stated in the proposition .",
    "let @xmath45 be the sequence of points on @xmath0 as described above",
    ". then @xmath46 must be contained in an arc of @xmath0 which contains @xmath26 for some @xmath25 but no overcrossing and no undercrossing of @xmath0 . in other words",
    ", @xmath46 must be between @xmath47 and @xmath48 for some @xmath25 .",

    "this proves the uniqueness of @xmath18 .",
    "such a sequence @xmath23 as in proposition 2.1 is said to be an _ over - underpass sequence _ of @xmath0 .",
    "since any over - underpass sequence of @xmath0 consists of @xmath20 points , the number of overpasses ( or underpasses ) with respect to any over - underpass sequence of @xmath0 is @xmath18 .",
    "hence , we define the number of overpasses ( or underpasses ) of the knot diagram @xmath0 as @xmath18 , and denote it by @xmath3 , sometimes called the length of over - underpass sequence . if a knot diagram @xmath0 has no crossing , we define @xmath3 as 0 . also , for each knot @xmath1 , we denote @xmath60 _",

    "obviously , for any positive integer @xmath18 , there is a diagram of a trivial knot whose number of overpasses is greater than @xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "given a knot diagram @xmath0 with at least one crossing , we can add crossings to @xmath0 as many as we want without changing the knot type and the number of overpasses of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , take a sufficiently small arc of @xmath0 from @xmath37 to a point between @xmath37 and the first overcrossing of @xmath0 from @xmath37 , and twist it alternatively so that the number of overpasses of @xmath0 is not changed . or",
    ", we may modify the interior of a sufficiently small neighborhood of a crossing of @xmath0 to achieve the goal of increasing @xmath2 arbitrarily while keeping @xmath3 and the knot type of @xmath0 fixed .",
    "hence , we have the following corollary .    if @xmath0 is a diagram of a knot @xmath1 such that @xmath71 , then for every positive integer @xmath72 , there is a diagram @xmath73 of @xmath1 such that @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "remark that the number of crossings of a knot diagram with a minimal number of overpasses can be arbitrarily large .",
