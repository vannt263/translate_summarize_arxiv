    "the experimental results showed a preference for the mass division leading to even-@xmath0 fragments @xcite .",
    "it was believed that at very low excitation energies , i.e. , high kinetic energies , the fragments will be fully paired .",

    "it is worth to underline that the importance of the landau - zener effect in the cold fission fragmentation behavior was anticipated , as mentioned in ref .",
    "however , the odd - even structure structure in fission is explained usually within statistical arguments , as for example in refs .",
    "recently , some arguments linked the odd - even structure also to the charge asymmetry evolution during the fission process @xcite , not only to the dissipated energy as has been done earlier @xcite .",
    "in this section , the ingredients required to investigate dynamically the odd - even effect are described .",
    "the usual theories of fission consider that the nuclear system is characterized by several generalized coordinates @xmath6 , @xmath7 . these coordinates vary and force the system to split into two separated fragments .",

    "it is possible to approximate the pairing interaction matrix elements with a constant value by using a renormalization procedure that depends on the number of states in the active pairing space and on the structure @xcite .",
    "concerning the pair breaking effect , it must be evidenced that only two types of velocity dependent excitation mechanisms are possible between different single particle ( or molecular ) states of a dynamical nuclear system @xcite : the radial coupling that can be described by the landau - zener effect in avoided levels crossings regions and the coriolis one produced in the region of real crossings .",
    "the coriolis coupling is responsible for transitions between levels characterized by quantum numbers of the projection of the spin that differ by one unity .",
    "this coupling is important in the treatment of the @xmath15-decay where the inertia is small and such an investigation was made in ref .",
    "concerning the dynamical pair breaking , it can be described by a mechanism similar to the landau - zener one .",

    "the single particle levels belonging to the core of the initial parent nucleus are rearranged in the two cores of the fragments .",
    "knowing the number of levels in each core , it is possible to redefine the pairing active space of each fragment and the asymptotic values of the lower energy states can be evaluated .",
    "after the scission , @xmath80 must be replaced by the sum @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the lower energies of the two fission fragments .",

    "if only one pair is broken along the fission path , the spin of the two nuclei delivered from one unique seniority two configuration must be the same .",
    "this last assumption is due to the fact that the landau - zener effect is produced between levels with the same good quantum numbers .      in order to determine the fission barriers , the total energy of the nuclear system",
    "is computed in the framework of the macroscopic - microscopic method @xcite .",
    "as mentioned previously , the whole system is characterized by some collective coordinates that determine approximately the behavior of many other intrinsic variables .",
    "the essential idea of this approach is that a macroscopic model , as the liquid drop one , describes quantitatively the smooth trends of the potential energy with respect the particle number and deformation whereas a microscopic approach as the shell model describes local fluctuations .",
    "the combined macroscopic - microscopic method should reproduce both smooth trends and local fluctuations .",
    "the basic ingredient in such an analysis is the shape parametrization that depends on several macroscopic degrees of freedom .",

    "we are left by five independent generalized coordinates @xmath89 ( @xmath56=1,5 ) that can be associated to five degrees of freedom : the elongation @xmath90 given by the distance between the centers of the spheroids ; the necking parameter @xmath91 related to the curvature of the neck , the eccentricities @xmath92 associated with the deformations of the nascent fragments and the mass asymmetry parameter @xmath93 , @xmath94 ( @xmath951,2 ) denoting the volumes of the virtual ellipsoids characterized by the semi - axis @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "[ figura2 ] .",
    "the entire model can be considered valid as long as the generalized coordinates and their variations in time make sense .    the many - body wave function and the single particle energies",
    "are provided by the woods - saxon two - center shell model @xcite .",
    "the woods - saxon potential , the coulomb interaction and the spin orbit term must be diagonalized in an eigenvector basis .",
    "the asymmetric two center shell oscillator provides an orthogonal eigenvector basis for only one hermite space @xcite . in this hermite space",
    "the behavior of both fragments can be described .",
    "when the elongation @xmath90 is zero , the eigenvector basis becomes that of the anisotropic oscillator .",
    "when @xmath90 tends to infinity , a two oscillator eigenvector system is obtained in the same hermite space , centered in the two fragments . in the intermediate situation , each eigenfunction has components in the two subspaces that belong to the fragments .",
    "so , the two center shell model provides permanently the wave functions associated to the lower energies of the single particle states pertaining to a major quantum number @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , molecular states formed by two fragments at scission could be precisely described .",
    "another feature of the two center shell model is related to the localization of the single particle wave function in one of the two potential wells after the scission . as evidenced in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to predict this localization for a given fragmentation before that the scission is produced .",

    "the calculations were made within three approximations for the inertia : the cranking model @xcite , the gaussian overlap approximation @xcite and the non - adiabatic cranking approach @xcite .",
    "the yields for odd - odd partitions are proportional with the expression : @xmath165 in the previous relation , the sums run over all the seniority two configuration taken into consideration for neutrons ( index @xmath56 ) and protons ( index @xmath166 ) that give unpaired nucleons in the two fragments .",

    "the averaging interval is @xmath169=0.5 mev .",
    "the observed experimental trends exhibited in fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite for cold fission yields were reproduced .",
    "the trends are same for the three approaches used for the inertia . at low excitation energy",
    "the odd - odd yields surpass the even - even ones .",
    "the even - even yields become larger for excitation energies larger that 3 - 4 mev , in accordance with the experimental findings .",
    "in this work , a microscopic model is proposed for the explanation of the odd - even effect in cold fission .",
    "this explanation is based on a mixing configuration mechanism that is produced during the fission process .",
    "this configuration mixing mechanism is obtained dynamically by solving a the generalized system of time dependent pairing equations , that include a pair - breaking effect .",
    "a first rule can be extracted from this model .",
    "the even - even fission products can not be obtained at zero excitation energies because of the existence of dynamical excitations produced in the avoided level crossing regions when the nuclear system deforms slowly .",
    "the magnitudes of the interactions and the location of the the avoided crossing regions are fixed along the fission path and are independent of the velocity of passage through these regions .",
    "if this velocity is large , the perturbation will act onto the cooper pair a small fraction of time .",
    "so , the chance to break a pair will be small .",
    "if the velocity is low , the pairs will traverse the regions in larger time durations .",
    "so , the probability to break a pair increases . on another hand ,",
    "high velocities lead to large dissipation energies .",
    "another characteristic that was not exploited in this work can be featured from the model .",
    "the lower excitation energies of a combination of two odd - odd partners can be obtained only if their spin are the same for neutrons and protons .",
    "if the spins of the partners are not the same , the model predicts that at least two pair ruptures are produced for neutrons or protons and additional single particle excitations must be taken into consideration .",
    "the possibility to jump from one level to another in a large scale amplitude motion was predicted by hill and wheeler in ref .",
    "dissipation in terms of landau - zener crossings during fission was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite where excitations were considered only for time - reversed pairs , neglecting the possible existence of unpaired nucleons . as evidenced in ref .",
    "@xcite , many studies were performed in order to exploit this mechanism in different type of processes .",
    "it was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the landau - zener mechanism is cached in the time dependent pairing equations ( [ ec1 ] ) and ( [ ec2 ] ) .",
    "pairs undergo landau - zener transitions on virtual levels with coupling strengths given by the value of the magnitude of the gap parameter .",
    "anyhow , it is the first time that the dynamical pair breaking effect was used to explain the odd - even effect in fission .",
    "it must be mentioned that a time - dependent microscopic approach to the scission process was described in ref .",
    "they observed that for scission time larger than 5@xmath170 s , the single particle excitations are negligible .",
    "this time that characterizes the neck rupture corresponds to a velocity of @xmath121 fm / fs in our calculations .",
    "the density of single particle levels increases in the region of the second barrier .",
    "therefore , from the outer saddle to the scission , many avoided crossing regions are produced and the chance to break a pair is enhanced .",
    "up to the second saddle , the number of avoided crossing regions is small an the system evolves merely in the seniority zero configuration .",
    "that gives a large penetrability for all channels , the mixing of configurations being produced especially in the outer barrier region .    in conclusion , by solving the dynamical microscopic equations of motion for an fissioning even - even system",
    "it is found that the probability to obtain an odd - odd partition overcomes the probability of an even - even one at excitation energies smaller than 4 mev , for the same division in mass numbers .",
    "the theoretical results are in accordance with the experimental behavior of the odd - even distributions at high kinetic energies .",
    "it is the first time that this behavior was explained within a quantum mechanical approach .",
