    "the concept of  quantum darwinism \" was introduced by w. zurek to emphasize , by analogy with the criterion of reproductive efficiency imposed by biological darwinism , the central role in the emergence of classicality played by the redundant encoding of einselected pointer states of a quantum system @xmath1 by orthogonal ( for all practical purposes ) fragments of the environment @xmath2 @xcite . in a recent and comprehensive review @xcite",
    ", zurek shows that redundant encoding of pointer states by @xmath2 not only enables but forces multiple observers who agree about which observables to measure , and who conduct independent measurements on orthogonal fragments of @xmath2 , to agree on the measured values of the chosen observables .",
    "the consistency forced on observers by @xmath2 s role as a witness to the evolution of @xmath1 enables both an explication of the appearance of wavefunction collapse and a derivation of born s rule using what is claimed to be a purely quantum - mechanical concept of probability @xcite .",
    "these results have been extended to cases in which the environment is noisy , and hence to cases of measurements with experimental uncertainty @xcite .",
    "this brief note does not challenge any of the formal results obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , it does point out that the concept of redundancy of encoding upon which quantum darwinism rests is implicitly and irreducibly classical .",
    "it shows that multiple observers making independent measurements can not demonstrate that their measurements access redundant encodings of information about a single system @xmath1 , but can at best assume redundancy of encoding on the basis of classical observations alone .",
    "hence quantum darwinism is circular : it requires an assumption of encoding redundancy justified by classical observations to explain the emergence of classicality .",
    "although quantum darwinism significantly illuminates the process by which classicality emerges , it therefore does not provide an explication of the emergence of classicality in purely quantum - mechanical terms , and hence does not achieve the conceptual advance over bohr s insistance that apparatus be viewed as intrinsically classical that it appears , at first glance , to represent .",
    "zurek defines the redundancy @xmath3 of information about a given system @xmath1 available in @xmath2 as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the size of a fragment @xmath6 of the environment that encodes all but @xmath7 of the information about the pointer states of @xmath1 ( eq . 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "critical to this definition is the stipulation that the fragments @xmath8 under consideration , each of which is taken to have a size on the order of @xmath5 , be disjoint and not coherently entangled , and hence dynamically independent for all practical purposes . it is the dynamical independence of the fragments @xmath8 that renders the encoding of pointer - state information redundant , as it permits one or more observers to independently gather information about the pointer states of @xmath1 without perturbing either @xmath1 or each other s records .",
    "observers of different fragments interact with distinct , disjoint and independent encodings of the pointer states of @xmath1 , e.g. distinct and independent substates of the photon field . because such distinct environmental substates encode the same pointer state of @xmath1 at any given time",
    ", observers interacting with such substates can and must agree not only about @xmath1 being in some pointer state ( i.e. they agree that @xmath9 has  collapsed \" ) but also about which pointer state @xmath1 is in ( i.e. they can collaboratively derive the born rule ) .",
    "hence redundant encoding appears to  largely settle \" the measurement problem ( @xcite p. 187 ) .",
    "the above definition of redundancy requires that observers can distinguish the encodings , in their fragments of the environment , of the pointer states of distinct systems .",
    "it requires , in other words , that if @xmath1 and @xmath10 are distinct systems embedded in @xmath2 , observers will be able to choose fragments @xmath8 of @xmath2 in such a way that the pointer states @xmath11 and @xmath12 of @xmath1 and @xmath10 respectively will be distinguishable in each of the @xmath8 . if but only if this assumption is true , observers detecting indistinguishable pointer states encoded by their distinct fragments of @xmath2 will be justified in concluding that their pointer states are redundant encodings that indicate the existence of a unique observed system .",
    "this assumption that distinct systems will encode distinguishable pointer states is an instance of  leibnitz s law \" of the identity of indiscernibles @xcite , where the indiscernibles in question are the independently - observed environmental encodings of the pointer states of each distinct system . in order for quantum darwinism to explain the emergence of classicality in quantum - mechanical terms",
    ", this assumption must not only be true , it must be demonstrably true from within quantum mechanics .",
    "the difficulty with quantum darwinism is that redundancy of encoding can not , in fact , be demonstrated .",
    "consider a situation in which macroscopic observers @xmath13 and @xmath14 have access to two disjoint macroscopic fragments @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the environment @xmath2 .",
    "each fragment @xmath8 contains a macroscopic apparatus @xmath17 , which following tegmark @xcite is regarded as consisting solely of a pointer @xmath18 that can indicate any of @xmath19 pointer states @xmath20 .",
    "suppose the observers each independently observe their pointers , and record indistinguishable values ; for example , each pointer indicates the value  5 \" .",
    "the observers then confer .",
    "are @xmath13 and @xmath14 justified in concluding that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are redundantly registering the information that a single system @xmath1 is in a pointer state @xmath23 that its interaction with @xmath2 has redundantly entangled with both @xmath24 and @xmath25 ?",
    "that is , can they rule out on the basis of observations the alternative possibility that two distinct , dynamically - decoupled systems @xmath1 and @xmath10 are interacting with the environment , and that both are independently in pointer states @xmath23 and @xmath26 that the available apparatus indicate by registering , each independently with its own pointer , the value  5 \" ?",
    "figure 1 illustrates this dilemma .",
    "the dilemma illustrated in fig .",
    "1 is not far - fetched .",
    "one need only imagine that the apparatus in @xmath16 is being calibrated , without either observer s knowledge , by an unseen technician who happens to choose  5 \" as a calibration value .",
    "more seriously , the apparatus in @xmath15 and @xmath16 may register apparently confirmatory values that prove , on further investigation , to be entirely spurious .",
    "such situations are not unknown in the history of particle physics ; the claims and counterclaims regarding the pentaquark ( reviewed in @xcite ) provide a recent example .",
    "the relevant question is _ how _ one goes about demonstrating redundant encoding or the lack thereof .",
    "the answer is suggested in fig . 1",
    ": one traces the wires until the physical interactions generating the pointer states @xmath27 and @xmath28 are fully revealed .",
    "only if these interactions can be shown to couple the independent pointers of @xmath29 and @xmath30 to the same system @xmath1 , i.e. to a single subset of quantum degrees of freedom , can the encoding be shown to be redundant .     tracing the wires \" involves expanding what counts as  apparatus \" at the expense of what counts as  environment \" within each fragment",
    "each observer @xmath31 interacts with a sequence of progressively higher - dimensional pointer states @xmath32 , @xmath33 , ... ,",
    "@xmath34 that include progressively more positions @xmath35 of the wire ; in actual practice , these expanded pointer states incorporate readings from larger and larger subsets of available apparatus .",
    "any such sequence of progressively - expanded pointer states terminates at a quantum limit beyond which the incorporation of additional environmental degrees of freedom into the observed apparatus irreversibly perturbs the system . at this quantum limit",
    ", decoherence fails ; the quantum degrees of freedom  inside the box \" are entangled with the apparatus components with which they interact , and are distinguishable from such apparatus components only by notational convention . determining which apparatus degrees of freedom are entangled at amplitudes sufficient for observation with which system degrees of freedom at this quantum scale is not possible without destroying the entangled quantum state .",
    "hence @xmath13 and @xmath14 can not determine whether their respective pointer states are generated by interactions between their respective apparatus @xmath29 and @xmath30 and a single subset of quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "they can not , in other words , demonstrate redundancy of encoding .    in practice",
    ", @xmath13 and @xmath14 may agree that their expanded apparatus pointer states @xmath34 provide sufficient evidence for them to _ assume _ that their original pointer states @xmath36 were generated by redundantly encoded information indicating a unique system state @xmath23 .",
    "such an assumption is , however , based on classical observations and introduced from outside the quantum framework .",
    "hence while zurek s analysis shows that for a suitable choice of @xmath8 , redundant registration of the pointer states of a pre - selected system @xmath1 by the independent pointers of multiple apparatus @xmath17 embedded in the @xmath8 is _ possible _ , it does not show that redundant registration of @xmath9 by any combination of the apparatus pointers is _",
    "necessary_. nothing in the quantum - mechanical formalism prevents the pointer of a given apparatus @xmath37 embedded in a fragment of the environment @xmath38 from registering the state of some alternative , decoupled system @xmath10 that interacts with @xmath2 so as to generate a pointer state @xmath39 indistinguishable from those of the other @xmath17 , regardless of what information about @xmath1 may be present in @xmath38 . a party of observers can agree to treat only @xmath1 as a system of interest , and can assume that the available apparatus redundantly registers its states , but nothing in the quantum mechanical formalism or in the data available through observation enforces such agreements or assumptions .",
    "quantum mechanics does not dictate system - environment decompositions , and does not enforce occam s razor or leibnitz s law . indeed the principle of superposition explicitly forbids such notional pre - selections of systems of interest from having physical consequences at scales where entanglement is relevant .",
    "the assumption that a tree viewed from two different angles is the same system of interest is not forced on one by quantum mechanics .",
    "it is a classical assumption motivated by our bias toward object permanence , and by practical experience at macroscopic scales .",
    "observers have access only to the pointer states of apparatus .",
    "indistinguishable apparatus pointer states suggest , but do not demonstrate , redundant encoding . while theoretical and practical considerations may provide excellent evidence to justify an expectation that a given fragment @xmath8 of the environment encodes information about a pre - selected system of interest @xmath1 , and that an apparatus @xmath17 embedded in @xmath8 registers that information with its pointer , this situation can not be demonstrated without destroying redundancy .",
    "redundant encoding of system pointer states by apparatus pointer states can at best be assumed if redundency is to be maintained .",
    "such an assumption is motivated and justified by classical , not quantum - mechanical considerations .",
    "quantum darwinism can not , therefore , be regarded as fully accounting for the appearance of a macroscopic world of redundantly encoded and hence re - identifiable objects .",
    "it can be claimed with confidence that ",
    "quantum states acquire objective existence when reproduced in many copies \" ( @xcite p. 165 ) ; the formalism of quantum darwinism demonstrates this .",
    "however , the  objective existence \" rests on the assumption that the  many copies \" are in fact copies .",
    "this is a classical assumption for which conclusive experimental evidence can not be obtained .",
    "the suggestions of an anonymous referee were helpful in improving the clarity of this paper ."
