    "quantum cryptographic protocols have garnered much acclaim in the last two decades for their ability to provide unconditional security , which is not practically assured by their classical counterparts .",
    "commercial availability of quantum infrastructure in the last decade has placed even more emphasis on developing methodologies to ascertain the reliability of protocols in practice .",
    "even though , protocols are theoretically secure , our experience with classical protocols has shown that security can be compromised during implementation .",
    "since modelling , analysing and verifying classical protocols have worked so well , developing techniques along these lines seems prudent for quantum cryptographic protocols as well .",
    "the cornerstone of quantum cryptographic protocols is the inherent probabilistic nature .",
    "unlike classical protocols which accommodates a passive eavesdropper , wherein the eavesdropper can copy the bits and analyse them later , quantum protocols mandate an active eavesdropper .",
    "this constraint is promulgated by the no - cloning@xcite theorem which handicaps the eavesdropper from copying qubits . to extract information from the qubits",
    "an eavesdropper will inevitably resort to measuring them in a basis which might be different from the encoding basis and thereby alters the state of the qubit .",
    "this action is probabilistic in nature .",
    "moreover , quantum protocols also involve both classical and quantum channels .",
    "therefore we need a language that is capable of modelling probabilistic phenomenon and also takes into account both classical and quantum communications .    communicating quantum processes ( cqp)@xcite is a language developed with the expert purpose of modelling quantum protocols .",
    "cqp uses the communication primitives of pi - calculus@xcite and has capabilities for applying unitary operators , performing measurements , and a static type system that differentiates between classical and quantum communications .",
    "hence cqp seems an obvious choice for modelling quantum protocols .",
    "reasoning along the same lines , prism allows us to model probabilistic transitions , as we show later , this allows to seamlessly translate a cqp model into a prism model .    previous work on analysis of bb84 by papanikolaou @xcite has reasoned about the probability of detecting an eavesdropper and corroborates the claim made by mayers in his proof of unconditional security of bb84 . however , this work does not model bb84 in cqp .",
    "we first model bb84 in cqp , conver the cqp model into prsim and check the validity of the observations made by papanikolaou@xcite .",
    "we then proceed to show that b92 s eavesdropping detection capabilities can be reasoned along the same lines .    to ensure brevity we have refrained from explaining quantum mechanical primitives like unitary operators , measurements and no - cloning theorem .",
    "one good resource is nielsen and chuang s work@xcite .",
    "also , we have only provided an elementary introduction to cqp , only to the extent to which we use it in this paper . a better and complete resource would be thimothy davidsons@xcite doctoral thesis .",
    "we are going to briefly explain quantum measurement , and working of bb84 and b92 protocols .",
    "it is inherent with any quantum mechanical system that any measurement done on the system will induce some irreversible disturbances .",
    "we are going to rely on this property of qubits heavily in any quantum cryptographic protocols .",
    "+ any quantum system can be represented as a vector in an @xmath0 dimensional complex hilbert space . measuring this quantum system",
    "can only give a set of priviliged results namely those associated with the basis vectors of the state space .",
    "+ for example , consider a _",
    "2-dimensional _ complex hilbert spcae with @xmath1 and @xmath2 as basis vectors .",
    "lets say the vector @xmath3 describes the system .",
    "if we try to measure the system in the basis @xmath4 , then the system changes to a new state , either @xmath5 or @xmath6 permanently .",
    "it has a probability @xmath7 of changing into @xmath5 and a probability @xmath8 of changing into @xmath6 .",
    "also , @xmath9 .",
    "we can also measure the system in whichever basis that we choose .",
    "lets measure the system in another basis @xmath10 , where + @xmath11 and @xmath12 , then the quantum state can be represented as @xmath13 .",
    "+ measuring this system in the basis @xmath10 will yield @xmath14 and @xmath15 with probability @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "a and b want to establish a secret for secure communication .",
    "a sends the encoding of some bits in the , basis to b on the quantum channel .",
    "b then chooses a random sequences of bases and measures the qubit sent by a in that basis .",
    "if the basis of alice and bob are equal then the b obtains the classical bit chosen by alice other wise she randomly gets @xmath4 .",
    "a and b then use the classical channel to exchange the basis and the corresponding measurements of qubits to decide upon a shared key or to detect the presence of an eavesdropper .      unlike bb84 where each classical bit has two different encoding depending on the basis used , b92 has only one . in other words",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between the classical bits and qubits exchanged . if alice wants to send a classical bit @xmath18 to bob she sends @xmath19and if she wants to send @xmath20 she sends @xmath21 .",
    "the rest of the steps involved are the same as in bb84 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , whenever eve measures the qubits that are in transit to bob from alice , she makes a permanent change to the state of qubits if she does nt use the same basis as that of alice . in bb84 protocol",
    "if on some qubits both alice and bob use the same basis to encode and measure but bob decodes a classical bit different from what alice encoded , suggests the presence of eve . in b92",
    "as well , alice and bob should obtain the opposite results when the encoding basis is the same , then an attacker is present .",
    "we are assuming the qubit channel shared by all the participants noiseless .",
    "a brief overview of cqp calculus is provided and then we proceed to formalise both the protocols in cqp .",
    "an example of bb84-bit commitment protocol in cqp@xcite was give by simon and gay and our formalisation uses the same techniques .",
    "a protocol at any given point of time has multiple participants , like _ alice _ and _ bob _ which are legitimate entities involved and also adversaries like .",
    "these entities are collectively known as _",
    "agents_. agents communicate with each other via communication channels to exchange information .",
    "the working of the agents is encapsulated by _",
    "processes_. every agent has more than one process , and at any given time its possible that more than one process is in action .",
    "these processes can be reasonably thought of as _ states _ in finite state automatons and every process transitions to another or terminates .",
    "cqp allows us to impose a probabilistic distribution across these transitions .",
    "also processes in cqp can be parametrised .",
    "+    1 .   channels are declared by the keyword .",
    "+ for example to declare a new qubit channel , we write ( qubitchannel:^ [ ] ) , where is the data type qubitchannel is constrained to and `` ^ '' identifies it as a channel .",
    "variables can be declared within a process like so , ( q ) .",
    "process output : _",

    "_ process decision : _",
    "@xmath26 if the expression @xmath27 evaluates to then proceed with process @xmath28 else @xmath29 7 .   _ terminate : _ @xmath30 the process terminates after @xmath31 .",
    "we identify that _",
    "_ bob _ are the primary agents of the protocol and to analyse the effects of an eavesdropper _ eve _ becomes an agent of the system as well .",
    "as described above channels can only transport messages of a particular type .",
    "we have to transport qubits , for integers and , , for bits .",
    "technically one bit channel would suffice .",
    "however having two different channels that are used at two different stages in the protocol helps us to convert the cqp - model into prism as will be elaborated in the next section .",
    "we have also made use of type , with its associated functions of , , and for reading the first element , dropping the first element , an empty list and placing data at the tail of the list respectively .",
    "the use of these functions is demonstrated by gay et al.@xcite .",

    "we have mentioned that we have used type .",
    "unfortunately a parallel for this type does not exist for . to overcome this handicap",
    "we will have to modify the model , in both the protocols the public discussion starts after both the parties have exchanged all the qubits . instead in the prism model after every qubit exchange , both the parties proceed to exchange the encoding basis and measured bit to establish the validity of the qubit . this way we can ensure that the original characteristics of the protocol remain intact .    *",

    "@xmath61    we make the following obeservations : @xmath62 . @xmath63 .    like the inferences made for bb84 , the chances of detecting an eavesdropper increases with the number of qubits exchanged and also the number of correct measurements that an eavesdropper can make decreases exponentially with the number of qubits exchanged .",
    "but unlike in bb84 , for b92 we have @xmath64 , hence the probability of eavesdropper detection is higher during intercept - resend than in random substitution .",
    "quite strangely we observe that with respect to random substitution type of attack , both the protocols perform identically .",
    "this is substantiated by the equations @xmath65 and @xmath66 however with respect to intercept resend style attacks they differ markedly , as evidenced by fig .",
    "12 and fig . 13 .",
    "b92 performs better in terms of eavesdropper detection as the probability approaches unity faster than b92 and in terms of decreased number of correct measurements that can be made by the eavesdropper .",
    "we have successfully modelled bb84 protocol in cqp , showed the process in which we have created prism models from the cqp models and analysed the properties using pctl .",
    "we also corroborate the observations made in earlier research with our analysis .",
    "we then extended the technique to b92-qkd protocol and compare the performance of the two .",
    "we infer that b92 is more resilient against an eavesdropper , with its ability to take fewer qubits than bb84 in identifying an eavesdropper and then potentially reducing the number of correct measurements the eavesdropper can make .",
