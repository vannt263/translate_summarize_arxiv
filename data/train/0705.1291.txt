    "the `` @xmath4 '' is the growth of small density perturbations , that leads to liquid - gas phase separation , in initially uniform matter located in the low density instability region of the @xmath0 phase diagram . in symmetric nuclear matter ,",
    "the `` @xmath4 '' was studied extensively in ref.s @xcite .    to our knowledge , the first publication on the liquid - gas phase separation in asymmetric ( neutron star ) matter is ref .",
    "@xcite , where the coexistence of asymmetric nuclei with a pure neutron gas was predicted , at zero temperature .",
    "recently , the liquid - gas phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter at finite temperature was studied in ref.s@xcite , always in an equilibrium thermodynamical approach .",
    "for instance , it was demonstrated in ref.@xcite , on the basis of the quantum statistical model , that light clusters emitted from neutron - rich systems have , in average , a larger relative neutron excess than the initial source .",
    "our discussion is more focussed on non - equilibrium properties of asymmetric nuclear matter and , in particular , on the possibility to observe collective dynamical formation of clusters , with specific mass and charge contents , _ on short time scales_. we expect this mechanism to be important in fast expanding systems , as in collisions of beta - unstable nuclei , or as a first step towards preferential equilibrium structures .",
    "the latter point , on possible different time scales in the clustering process , will be also addressed in this article .",

    "moreover , new non - equilibrium features of the fast clustering processes in asymmetric nuclear systems , that can not be explained within a thermodynamical approach , are discussed .",
    "for instance , for neutron excess systems the proton fraction in the gas phase is expected to be larger when compared to statistical predictions @xcite .",
    "this effect can be related to the _ `` freeze - out '' _ time , preventing the chemical equilibration in the dynamics of heavy ion collisions .",

    "we start from a mean field description of nuclear dynamics based on two vlasov equations , for neutron and proton liquids @xcite , coupled through a self - consistent nuclear field : @xmath5 here the subscript @xmath6 stands for @xmath7 ( neutrons ) or @xmath8 ( protons ) and @xmath9 is the phase - space distribution function ( d.f . ) . for simplicity , in eq.(1 ) we neglect effective mass corrections and the difference between neutron and proton masses , putting @xmath10 . indeed in the low density region studied here we do not expect to have large effective mass corrections . finally , @xmath11 is the self - consistent mean field potential in a skyrme - like form @xcite  : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the potential energy density ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the total ( isoscalar ) and the relative ( isovector ) density ; @xmath16 is the nuclear saturation density ; @xmath17 = + 1 ( @xmath18 ) , -1 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath20 mev , @xmath21 mev , @xmath22 and @xmath23 mev@xmath24@xmath25 are adjusted to reproduce the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter ( binding energy @xmath26 mev / nucleon at @xmath27 , zero pressure at @xmath27 , compressibility modulus @xmath28 mev ) and the surface energy coefficient in the weizscker mass formula @xmath29 mev .",
    "we put @xmath30 mev@xmath24@xmath31 according to ref.@xcite , that is also close to the value @xmath32 mev@xmath24@xmath25 given by the skm@xmath33 interaction @xcite .",

    "then , in the particular case of @xmath65 one can obtain the following simple expression for the lindhard function ( [ lfun ] ) ( see ref.@xcite )  : @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "we stress that without considering the wave number dependence in the landau parameters ( [ lpar1 ] ) one has @xmath68 and , hence , an unphysical growth of the short wave length perturbations is favoured @xcite .",
    "stability conditions of asymmetric nuclear matter against density fluctuations are derived in the appendix .",
    "the system becomes unstable if at least one of conditions ( [ c1 ] ) , ( [ c2 ] ) is violated .",
    "the linear technique described above is applicable only in the regime of small - amplitude perturbations , and some relevant results will be shown in the next section . then as a second step , see sect .",
    "iv , we consider the more powerful numerical solution of the vlasov eqs .",
    "( [ ve ] ) , which is based on the test - particle approach @xcite .",
    "the detailed description of the numerical method is given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this way",
    ", we can also have effects from nonlinear terms and particle collisions .",
    "the latter contribution is indeed always present in the dynamical response of heated nuclear matter .",
    "however , the main results shown in the next section from a pure mean field approach should not be much affected , since a very dilute system is considered .",
    "this will be also confirmed from comparisons with numerical simulations , where the collision integral is included ( see sect .",
    "we discuss , first , the results of the linear response theory . fig .",
    "1 shows the instability region ( under curves ) , as given by the inequality : @xmath69 with the landau parameters taken at @xmath70 ( see the stability condition ( [ c2 ] ) and text below in the appendix ) in the @xmath71 plane for different asymmetries @xmath72 ( a ) and in the @xmath73 plane for different temperatures ( b ) .",
    "the asymmetry leads to shrinking of the spinodal region , reducing both critical temperature and density ( fig .",
    "1a ) , in agreement with the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "this is indeed a quite general effect due to the attractive neutron - proton effective interaction and repulsive neutron - neutron and proton - proton ones @xcite : a repulsive symmetry term is softening the @xmath0 for asymmetric @xmath1 reducing then the low density instability region .",
    "an increasing temperature also reduces the unstable region in the @xmath73 plane ( fig.1b ) .",
    "we have solved the dispersion relation eq.([drel ] ) looking at isoscalar growing modes @xmath74 , considering various choices of the initial density , temperature and asymmetry of nuclear matter .",
    "fig . 2 reports the growth rate @xmath75 as a function of the wave vector @xmath60 .",
    "the growth rate has a maximum @xmath76 c / fm corresponding to a wave vector value around @xmath77 and becomes equal to zero at @xmath78 , due to @xmath60-dependence of the landau parameters , as discussed above .",
    "one can see also that instabilities are reduced when increasing the temperature . this effect is present also in the symmetric",
    "n = z case @xcite .    at larger initial",
    "asymmetry the development of the `` @xmath4 '' is slower .",
    "one should expect also an increasing of the size of the produced fragments due to the `` @xmath4 '' features in asymmetric systems .",
    "the effect of the asymmetry on the growth time @xmath79 and on the wave length @xmath80 of the most unstable mode is shown in fig .",
    "it is quite clear that the asymmetry dependence of both variables @xmath81 and @xmath82 is more pronounced at higher temperature , when the system is closer to the boundary of the spinodal region .",
    "a better understanding of the `` @xmath4 '' in a two - component system can be achieved by studying the chemical composition of the growing mode . on fig .",
    "4 we show the asymmetry of the perturbation @xmath83 as a function of the asymmetry of the initially uniform system @xmath84 . without any chemical processes , we should expect @xmath85 .",
    "however , we obtain @xmath86 .",
    "this means that a growing mode produces more symmetric high - density regions ( liquid phase ) and less symmetric low - density regions ( gas phase ) .",
    "hence , during the `` @xmath4 '' , a collective diffusion of protons from low - density regions to high - density regions takes place .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "4 that the chemical effect becomes stronger with increasing density .",
    "this can be explained by the increasing behaviour of the symmetry energy per nucleon with density , in the density region considered here .",
    "the effect of increasing the temperature goes in the opposite direction , reducing the chemical effect . _",
    "the conclusion is that the fast `` @xmath4 '' mechanism in a neutron - rich matter will dynamically form more symmetric fragments surrounded by a less symmetric gas .",
    "_ some recent experimental observations from fragmentation reactions with neutron rich nuclei seem to be in agreement with this result on the fragment isotopic content : nearly symmetric intermediate mass fragments ( @xmath87 ) have been detected surrounded by very neutron - rich light ions @xcite .",
    "the previous analytical study is restricted to the onset of the `` @xmath4 '' , in a linearized approach . then numerical calculations were performed in order to study all stages of the fragment formation process . in the numerical approach",
    "we consider nuclear matter in a cubic box of size @xmath88 imposing periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we follow a phase - space test particle method to solve the landau - vlasov dynamics , using gaussian wave packets @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of nucleon - nucleon collisions is included by solving the boltzmann - nordheim collision integral using a monte - carlo method @xcite .",
    "we choose the width of the gaussians in order to correctly reproduce the surface energy value in finite systems . in this way",
    "a cut - off appears in the short wavelength unstable modes , preventing the formation of too small , unphysical , clusters @xcite . in order to have a correct mean field treatment also on the edges of the box ,",
    "we have used a self - consistent _ stuffing _ method , filling a layer of @xmath89 thickness all around the box with test particles having symmetric positions with respect to those on the opposite side in the box .",
    "the calculations were performed using 80 gaussians per nucleon and the number of nucleons inside the box was fixed in order to reach the initial uniform density value .",
    "an initial temperature is introduced by distributing the test particle momenta according to fermi d.f .",
    "we have checked that we reproduce at equilibrium the right `` eos '' corresponding to the used effective forces ( see sect .",
    "we have followed the space - time evolution of test - particles in the box with side @xmath90 for three values of the initial asymmetry @xmath91 and @xmath92 , at initial density @xmath93 and temperature @xmath94 mev .",
    "the initial density perturbation was created automatically due to the random choice of test - particle positions .",
    "results for the initial asymmetries @xmath95 and @xmath96 , are reported in fig . 5 , ( a ) and ( b ) respectively .",

    "we have compared the dynamical evolution , as given by the test particle method , with the analytical predictions of sect .",

    "two variables were constructed : the total density variance ( see @xcite ) @xmath100 and the correlation function between proton and neutron density perturbations , normalized to the neutron density variance , @xmath101 in eqs .",
    "( [ totvar]),([rpn ] ) @xmath102 denotes the average over all test particles , while @xmath103 denotes the average over neutrons only .",
    "the densities @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 were calculated in the position of the test particle considered by taking contributions from gaussians of all test particles . for a dominant plane - wave perturbation we have : @xmath107 fig .",
    "6 shows the evolution of @xmath108 ( a ) and of the ( test - particle ) perturbation asymmetry @xmath109 ( b ) , for the same initial conditions discussed above , i.e. @xmath110 , @xmath93 and asymmetries @xmath111 .",
    "a general feature is the clear linear increase of @xmath112 in the time interval @xmath113 fm / c . during the first @xmath114",
    "the system is quickly `` self - organizing '' selecting the most unstable normal mode . afterwards",
    "the variance ( eq . ( [ totvar ] ) ) increases exponentially with a time scale given by @xmath115 . in correspondence",
    "( see fig.6b ) , the perturbation asymmetry @xmath116 reveals also a quick saturation at @xmath117 fm / c . at earlier times the proton and neutron density perturbations",
    "are not correlated , but at @xmath118 fm / c the correlation of plane - wave type @xmath119 develops .",
    "we notice that the time scales necessary to reach the asymmetry value characteristic of the most important growing modes , that are quite short in our calculations , generally depend on the structure of the initial noise put in the neutron and proton densities . in our calculations",
    "all modes are nearly equally excited .",
    "this causes the quick appearance of the features associated with the dominant mode . in agreement with analytical calculations",
    ", the instability grows slower in the case of larger asymmetry .    for an initial asymmetry @xmath96 , the extracted values of growth time @xmath120 c / fm and perturbation asymmetry @xmath121 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , and of wave length @xmath122 fm ( from the distance between the density distribution maxima in fig .",
    "5b ) , are in good agreement with the analytical results presented in figs . 3,4 .",
    "the `` @xmath4 '' leads to a fast formation of the liquid ( high density ) and gaseous ( low density ) phases in the matter .",
    "indeed this dynamical mechanism of clustering will roughly end when the variance ( eq . ( [ totvar ] ) )",
    "saturates @xcite , i.e. around @xmath123 in the asymmetric cases ( see fig .",
    "we will discuss in the following the `` chemistry '' of the liquid phase formation . in fig .",
    "7 we report the time evolution of neutron ( thick histogram in fig .",
    "7a ) and proton ( thin histogram in fig .",
    "7a ) abundances and asymmetry ( fig .",
    "7b ) in various density bins .",
    "the dashed line respectively shows the initial uniform density value @xmath124 ( fig .",
    "7a ) and the initial asymmetry @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "the drive to higher density regions is clearly different for neutrons and protons : at the end of the dynamical clustering mechanism we have very different asymmetries in the liquid and gas phases ( see the panel at @xmath125 in fig .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , on the basis of thermodynamics , that the two phases should have different asymmetries , namely , @xmath126 , and actually a pure neutron gas was predicted at zero temperature if the initial global asymmetry is large enough ( @xmath127 ) @xcite .",
    "here we are studying this chemical effect in a non - equilibrium clustering process , on very short time scales .",
    "the interest is in the observation of new features , not expected in a thermodynamical picture .    in our numerical model ,",
    "we divide the system into liquid - like and gas - like phases as follows .",
    "the @xmath128-th test particle belongs to the liquid- ( gas- ) like phase if @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the total density in the position of the @xmath128-th test particle , @xmath131 is the initial density @xcite .",
    "8 presents the time evolution of the asymmetry in liquid and in gas .",
    "strong fluctuations take place at the beginning of the evolution .",
    "however , at @xmath118 fm / c , results are quite stable . in the symmetric case ( @xmath95 ) ,",
    "both liquid and gas keep the symmetry in the course of the time evolution .",
    "_ however for non - zero initial asymmetry liquid becomes more symmetric and gas less symmetric ( neutron - rich ) as time goes .",
    "_ the asymmetry in liquid and gas phases saturates rather early , at @xmath132 fm / c , just on the time scale of dynamical clusterization .",
    "this suggests an evidence of a two - stage fragment formation process .",
    "on the first stage , the fast `` @xmath4 '' takes place ( @xmath133 fm / c , see fig .",
    "6a ) . at the end of this stage ,",
    "due to reduced asymmetry of the perturbation , see fig .",
    "4 , liquid acquires a lower asymmetry and gas acquires a higher one . on the second stage ( @xmath134 fm / c ) we have a statistical nucleation process : protons and neutrons diffuse very slowly from gas to liquid , see fig .",
    "9a , with approximately equal rates ( fig .",
    "since the gas is already highly asymmetric and the liquid is more close to symmetry , this diffusion process leads to a further growth of asymmetry in the gas and does not change the asymmetry of the liquid . eventually , on long time scales , we can expect to reach the thermodynamical limit of refs .",
    "@xcite , i.e. an almost pure neutron gas .    from our dynamical analysis",
    "we can conclude that the second slow mechanism for liquid formation is certainly present in a confined system and will be stopped in an expanding case .",
    "we deduce that the isotopic contents of the gas phase could give a measure of the `` _ freeze - out _ '' time : a very neutron - rich gas will correspond to a slowly expanding nuclear system .",
    "this effect is quantitatively shown in fig .",
    "10 where we present asymmetries of the two phases at different time stages , as given by the test - particle simulations .",
    "we choose two `` _ freeze - out _ ''",
    "times , one corresponding to the intermediate stage of the `` @xmath4 '' ( @xmath135 fm / c ) and the second inside the slow diffusion process ( @xmath136 fm / c ) .",
    "the first choice of freeze - out time is close to the time scale of the fast multifragment breakup in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .    the asymmetry of the liquid is , practically , not dependend on the choice of `` _ freeze - out _ '' time . on the contrary ,",
    "the asymmetry of the gas and the number of gas particles are very sensitive to this choice .",
    "an investigation of fragment formation through spinodal decomposition in low - density asymmetric nuclear matter has been performed .",
    "important information on the early evolution of the unstable modes is obtained performing an analytical linear analysis to the vlasov equations , for neutron and proton liquids , coupled through the mean field .",
    "then a numerical study of nuclear systems with periodic boundary conditions has been applied to describe all stages of the fragment formation process .",
    "we have shown that charge asymmetry changes time and space scales of the fragment formation process .",
    "this effect could be observed experimentally .    with respect to the fragment isotopic distribution",
    ", we predict that the `` @xmath4 '' in asymmetric systems is accompanied by a collective diffusion of protons from low to high density regions .",
    "thus the produced heavy fragments will be more symmetric than the initial uniform system .",
    "this qualitatively corroborates earlier thermodynamical studies @xcite .",
    "however the chemical composition of fragments is established just after the finishing of the fast `` @xmath4 '' stage .",
    "hence it is essentially defined by the non - equilibrium mean field dynamics and a thermodynamical approach gives only a rough schematic description of this process , with a slow nucleation component likely absent in fragmentation reactions with radioactive beams . in general in a dynamical multifragmentation process with neutron rich systems we expect a proton fraction in the gas phase , i.e. among emitted nucleons and light clusters , larger than the thermodynamical prediction . finally we think that different choices of effective interaction , ( eg . with different density dependence in the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath137 ) will support the qualitative conclusions of our work , since all realistic effective interactions give a similar behaviour for the potential symmetry energy per nucleon in the region of subnuclear densities @xcite .",
    "however the size of the instability region and the isotopic structure of the most unstable collective modes will be certainly dependent on the used effective force .",
    "therefore , considering fragmentation reactions with radioactive beams , it would be possible to extract important information on the low density part of the @xmath0 in asymmetric nuclear matter , of large interest for the understanding of life and structure of neutron stars .",
