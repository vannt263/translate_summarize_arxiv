    "in recent years , the study of surfaces with constant mean curvature in homogeneous three - manifolds is a topic of great activity , specially after the extension by abresch and rosenberg of the hopf theorem for this kind of spaces ( @xcite ) : see also @xcite and references therein . among the eight models of the geometry of thurston ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the space sol@xmath0 is the space with the smallest isometry group . as a riemannian manifold",
    ", the space sol@xmath0 can be represented by @xmath1 equipped with the metric @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the canonical coordinates of @xmath1 .",
    "the space sol@xmath0 is a lie group with the operation @xmath4 and the metric @xmath5 is left - invariant with respect to the operator group .",
    "it is natural to consider the study of curves and surfaces in sol@xmath0 with some added geometric property .",
    "for example , the geodesics of sol@xmath0 were studied in @xcite , the totally umbilical invariant surfaces in @xcite and constant angle surfaces in @xcite .",
    "the surfaces in sol@xmath0 with constant mean curvature have received special attention . in the search of explicit examples ,",
    "some properties on the geometry of the surface have been assumed , for instance , to be invariant under some group of isometries ( @xcite ) or to be a translation surface ( @xcite ) .",
    "compact surfaces with constant mean curvature and non - empty boundary were studied in @xcite and some properties on minimal surfaces in @xcite .",
    "motivated by the extension of the hopf theorem , an interesting problem posed in sol@xmath0 was whether exist closed surfaces with constant mean curvature . by the alexandrov reflection method , an embedded compact surface with constant mean curvature must be of genus @xmath6 . in a first step , daniel and mira showed the existence of such surfaces for each value of @xmath7 with @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally meeks extended the result for any real number @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main difficulty in order to obtain examples of surfaces with constant mean curvature is that sol@xmath0 has a small isometry group as for example , there are no rotations .",
    "the isometry group iso(sol@xmath0 ) has dimension @xmath9 and the component of the identity is generated by the following two families of isometries ( see @xcite ) : @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "we consider surfaces invariant under a uniparametric group of isometries . in this ambient space",
    ", there are three types of such groups , namely , if @xmath13 is the canonical basis of @xmath1 , each one of the above group is determined by the left translations by @xmath14 , @xmath15 : @xmath16 constant mean curvature surfaces invariant by @xmath17 and @xmath18 were classified in @xcite . in this work we focus in the third group @xmath19 .",
    "consider @xmath20 the left translation by @xmath21 : @xmath22 a set @xmath23 will called _ @xmath9-invariant _ if @xmath24 for any @xmath25 . since we shall work with immersed surfaces in sol@xmath0 , we need to explicit the next definition :    let @xmath26 be a surface and @xmath27 an immersion .",
    "we say that @xmath28 a is @xmath9-invariant surface if it is the set @xmath29 .",
    "when the immersion is known in the context , we identify @xmath26 with @xmath29 and we abbreviate by saying that @xmath26 is a @xmath9-invariant surface .",
    "in this article we study @xmath9-invariant surfaces with constant mean curvature @xmath7 .",
    "since a @xmath9-invariant surface is generated by a curve @xmath30 , the condition @xmath31 expresses as an ordinary differential equation and for any initial condition we have a solution .",
    "however it is difficult to solve the equation @xmath31 in all its generality , even in the minimal case ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "part of our study is supported in the use of a computer to make numerical pictures of the surfaces that in our case , it has been possible by using a symbolic program such as mathematica .",
    "this contrast to with the minimal surfaces invariant by the groups @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where all solutions were done in @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s-2 ] takes up the most part of the article where we study @xmath9-invariant surfaces with zero mean curvature .",
    "we shall obtain explicit examples and some geometric properties . at the end of section [ s-2 ]",
    ", we will relate some of these minimal surfaces with spheres of sol@xmath0 with constant mean curvature . in section [ s-3 ] ,",
    "we consider surfaces with non - zero constant mean curvature .",
    "due to the difficulty of the mean curvature equation , we give some graphics of such surfaces , showing by numerical computations the existence of generating curves that are simply closed curves .",
    "last section [ s-4 ] is devoted to give explicit examples of constant gauss curvature surfaces in sol@xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath33 be a @xmath9-invariant surface .",
    "the orbit of a point @xmath3 of sol@xmath0 is the curve @xmath34 , which acroses once the plane @xmath35 ( at the time @xmath36 )",
    ". therefore @xmath26 parametrizes by the set of orbits of a curve @xmath37 contained in the plane @xmath35 .",

    "the mean curvature @xmath7 of @xmath28 with respect to a local parametrization @xmath52 is @xmath53 where , as usually , @xmath54 and @xmath55 stand for the coefficients of the first and second fundamental form , respectively , that is : @xmath56 @xmath57 without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath37 is parametrized by the arc length .",
