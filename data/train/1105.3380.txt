    ", several near - infrared spectral surveys have been devoted to the study of the x group and in particular the m and e - type asteroids , revealing that these bodies show great diversity in the infrared , even within the same class .",
    "in addition , polarimetric measurements ( lupishko & belskaya 1989 ) and radar observations ( ostro et al . , 1991 , 2000 ; margot and brown , 2003 ; magri et al . , 2007 ; shepard et al . , 2008 , 2010 ) of selected m - type asteroids have revealed surface properties that are in some cases inconsistent with metallic iron .",
    "moreover , spectra of m - types are not uniformly featureless as initially believed ; several spectral absorption bands have been detected in the visible and near infrared ranges .",
    "faint absorption bands near 0.9 and 1.9 @xmath0 m have been identified on the surfaces of some m - types ( hardersen et al . , 2005 ; clark et al .",

    "a very peculiar absorption band , centered around 0.49 - 0.50 @xmath0 m , extending from about 0.41 to 0.55 @xmath0 m , was found on some e - type spectra ( burbine et al , 1998 ; fornasier & lazzarin , 2001 ; clark et al .",

    "+ of note is the evidence for hydrated minerals on the surfaces of some e and m - type asteroids ( jones et al , 1990 ; rivkin et al , 1995 , 2000 , 2002 ) , inferred from the identification of an absorption feature around 3 @xmath0 m .",
    "this feature is typically attributed to the first overtone of h@xmath9o and to oh vibrational fundamentals in hydrated silicates . if the origin of the 3 @xmath0 m band on e and m - type asteroids is actually due to hydrated minerals , then these objects are not all igneous as previously believed and the thermal scenario in the inner main belt would need revision .",
    "gaffey et al . ( 2002 ) propose alternative explanations for the 3 @xmath0 m band : materials normally considered to be anhydrous containing structural oh ; troilite , an anhydrous mineral that shows a feature at 3 @xmath0 m , or xenolithic hydrous meteorite components on asteroid surfaces from impacts and solar wind implanted h. rivkin et al .",

    "for the other 3 asteroids , we can not exclude that some spectral differences may be linked with unresolved observational differences ( such as background stars , or undetected troubles in removing the atmosphere ) .",
    "our targets were classified as belonging to the tholen x class on the basis of their spectra from 0.4 to 1 @xmath0 m and because their albedos were not known at the time of classification . since the original x - type classification in the tholen taxonomy ,",

    "1122 nieth ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , initially classified as x - type in the tholen taxonomy , has atypical spectral properties that diverge from all other asteroids . the near infrared spectrum of nieth clearly shows a strong 0.96 @xmath0 m absorption band and a steep slope in the nir region .",

    "comparing the @xmath12 slopes with the @xmath11 slopes ( calculated from 0.49 to 0.55 @xmath0 m ) of the low albedo asteroids , we find two distinct distributions correlated with the c and p - classes .",
    "the 6 asteroids ( 50 , 220 , 223 , 283 , 536 , and 517 ) having the uv absorption and @xmath20  belong to the c - type , while the 4 asteroids ( 275 , 463 , 522 , and 909 ) having @xmath21  belong to the p - type . 1902 shaposhnikov , observed only in the near infrared range , is probably also a p - type , while 3447 burckhalter , for which the albedo value is 0.336@xmath170.164 ( gil - hutton et al .",
    "2007 ) could possibly be an e - type .",
    "to constrain the possible mineralogies of our asteroids , we conducted a search for meteorite and/or mineral spectral matches .",
    "we sought matches only for objects observed across the entire vis - nir wavelength range .",
    "a complete description of the search methodology can be found in clark et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and fornasier et al .",
    "we used the publicly available relab spectrum library ( pieters 1983 ) , which consisted of nearly 15,000 spectra in november of 2008 .",
    "relab spectra were normalized to 1.0 at 0.55 @xmath0 m , and then a chi - squared value was calculated for each relab spectrum relative to the normalized input asteroid spectrum .",
    "the relab spectra were sorted according to chi - squared values , and then visually examined for dynamic weighting of spectral features by the spectroscopist .",
    "given similar chi - squared values , a match that mimicked spectral features was preferred over a match that did not .",
    "we visually examined the top  200 chi - squared matches for each asteroid and we constrain the search for analogues to those laboratory spectra with brightness ( reflectance at 0.55 @xmath0 m ) roughly comparable to the albedo of the asteroid .",
    "it must be noted that the asteroid data are disk integrated , which could mask spectral variations due to differences in particle size , mineralogy , or abundance .",
    "however the meteorite and mineral spectra are well characterized powders measured under well defined laboratory conditions .",
    "it should also be noted that an asteroid s albedo is defined at phase angle zero , whereas meteorites reflectance is taken at phase angle @xmath22 . for the asteroid albedo value",
    ", we used the iras albedo published by tedesco et al .",
    "for the darker asteroids ( below 10% albedo ) , this is a fairly well - constrained value .",
    "the uncertainty for brighter asteroid albedos ( above 10% albedo ) is relatively larger . to account for this , we filtered out lab spectra if brightness differed by more than @xmath17 3% in absolute albedo for the darker asteroids ( albedos less than 10% ) , and we filtered out lab spectra if brightness differed by more than @xmath17 5% in absolute albedo for the brighter asteroids ( albedos greater than 10% ) .",
    "for example , if the asteroid s albedo was 10% , we searched over all lab spectra with 0.55 @xmath0 m reflectance between 5% and 15% .",
    "once the brightness filter was applied , all materials were normalized before comparison by least- squares .",
    "our search techniques effectively emphasized the spectral characteristics of brightness and shape , and de - emphasized minor absorption bands and other parametric characteristics .",
    "as such , we suggest that our methods are complementary to band parameter studies .    [ here table 4 ]    [ here figures 5 and 6 ]    the best matches between the observed x - type asteroids and meteorites from the relab database are reported in table  [ tab ] .",
    "we matched only the 15 asteroids observed both in the visible and near infrared range that have published albedo values .",
    "some meteorite matches are quite good , while for some asteroids the best meteorite match we found does not satisfactorily reproduce both the visual and near infrared spectral behavior . in particular our attempt to find a meteorite or mineral match failed for the 3 asteroids 1122 nieth ( a - type ) , 1328 devota ( d - type ) , and 1355 magoeba ( m - type ) .    the best matches we found for 7 moderate albedo m - type asteroids are presented in figure  [ fig5met ] .",
    "two asteroids , 741 botolphia and 1146 biarmia were not compared with relab spectra due to the lack of near - infrared spectral data .",
    "we find that iron or pallasite meteorites are the best matches both for the featureless m - type asteroids and for those having minor absorption bands .",
    "this result supports the link between m - type asteroids and iron or pallasite meteorites suggested in the literature by several authors . in this small sample ,",
    "no enstatite chondrites , which have also been suggested to be linked with m - type asteroids , have been found as the best meteorite analogue .",
    "the strongest analogy we found is between 758 mancunia and a sample of the iron meteorite landes which has a large number of silicate inclusions in a nickel - iron matrix .",
    "it must be noted that no specific grain - size sampling filter was applied , and of concern is the fact that mancunia s best match is with a spectrum obtained of the cut slab surface of the landes iron meteorite .",
    "758 mancunia has a radar albedo of 0.55@xmath170.14 ( shepard et al .",
    "2008 ) one of the highest values measured for the asteroids , suggesting a very high metal content .",
    "shepard et al . ( 2008 ) also found variations in the radar cross - section and polarization ratio with mancunia s rotational phase , variations that are not related to shape but to the regolith depth , porosity , or near - surface roughness .",

    "( 2010 ) mancunia spectrum shows absorption bands in the 0.9 and 1.9 @xmath0 m region , and is found to be similar to the ordinary chondrite paragould .",

    "2010 , fieber - beyer et al . 2006 ) , whose origin is not yet understood . considering both radar and spectral observations ,",
    "758 mancunia could present an heterogeneous surface composition , with a high metal content but also the presence of some silicates that are not uniformly distributed on the surface .",
    "the landes iron meteorite sample was found to be the best spectral match also for 337 devosa , even if the meteorite does not fully reproduced the 0.88 @xmath0 m absorption band of the asteroid .",
    "a similar problem occurred for 417 suevia and 1124 stroobantia , where different grain sized samples of the iron meteorite drp78007 are found to be the best spectral matches , but they did not reproduce the asteroids absorption bands in the 0.9 @xmath0 m region .",
    "we note that grain size effects can play an important role in the spectral behavior of iron - nickel meteorites .",
    "in fact britt and pieters ( 1988 ) found that the spectra of m - type asteroids show good agreement with those of iron meteorites with surface features in the range of 10 @xmath0 m to 1 mm , that is larger that the wavelength of incident light .",
    "meteorites with these roughness values are diffuse reflectors and show the classic red slope continuum of iron , with practically no geometric dependence on reflection . on the other hand ,",
    "a decreasing of the meteorite surface roughness changes the reflectance characteristics : complex scattering behavior is seen for roughness in the 0.7 - 10 @xmath0 m range , while for roughness values @xmath23 0.7 @xmath0 m the reflectance is characterized by two distinct components , the specular one which is bright and red sloped , and the nonspecular one which is dark and flat . + for 77 frigga we were not able to find any meteoritic / mineral analog within the medium albedo range that could reproduce frigga s red visible slope and flat near - infrared slope .",

    "we propose two different meteorites : the best spectral match is with a metal - rich powder sample of the pallasite meteorite esquel , whose albedo of 0.14 is lower than the 0.25 value of the asteroid .",
    "the iron meteorite babb s mill was a better numerical fit ( minimum chi squared fit ) and had a more comparable albedo , but was not favored because babb s mill has a near infrared spectrum that is much flatter than that of undina .    in figure  [ fig6met ]",
    "we present the best matches proposed for six low albedo asteroids .",
    "it has long been noticed that reflectance spectra of carbonaceous chondrites are similar to those of the low - albedo asteroids ( gaffey & mccord 1978 ; hiroi et al .",
    "in particular , cm meteorites show features due to aqueous alteration processes and are linked to low albedo aqueous altered asteroids like the c and g - types ( see vilas et al .",
    "1994 , burbine 1998 , fornasier et al .",
    "indeed , all the observed low albedo asteroids are best fit with cm meteorites , either unaltered ( 50 virginia and 283 emma ) or altered by heating episodes ( 275 sapientia and 517 edith ) or laser irradiation ( 522 helga and 909 ulla ) ( see fig .  [ fig6met ] ) .",
    "the cm2 met00639 meteorite matches very well the visible range spectrum of 50 virginia and in particular the 0.7 @xmath0 m band attributed to @xmath24 charge transfer absorptions in phyllosilicate minerals .",

    "<S> sixteen asteroids were observed in the visible and near - infrared wavelength range , seven objects in the visible wavelength range only , and one object in the near - infrared wavelength range only . </S>",
    "<S> we find a large variety of near - infrared spectral behaviors within the x class , and we identify weak absorption bands in spectra of 11 asteroids . </S>",
    "<S> our spectra , together with albedos published by tedesco et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) , can be used to suggest new tholen classifications for these objects . </S>",
    "<S> we describe 1 a - type ( 1122 ) , 1 d - type ( 1328 ) , 1 e - type ( possibly , 3447 burckhalter ) , 10 m - types ( 77 , 92 , 184 , 337 , 417 , 741 , 758 , 1124 , 1146 and 1355 ) , 5 p - types ( 275 , 463 , 522 , 909 , 1902 ) , and 6 c - types ( 50 , 220 , 223 , 283 , 517 , and 536 ) . in order to constrain the possible composition of these asteroids , </S>",
    "<S> we perform a least - squares search through the relab spectral database . </S>",
    "<S> many of the best fits are consistent with meteorite analogue materials suggested in the published literature . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we find that 7 of the new m - types can be fit with metallic iron ( or pallasite ) materials , and that the low albedo c / p - type asteroids are best fitted with cm meteorites , some of which have been subjected to heating episodes or laser irradiation . </S>",

    "<S> faint absorption features like the 0.9 @xmath0 m band seen on 4 newly classified m - type asteroids are not reproduced by the iron meteorites . in these cases , we have searched for geographical mixture models that can fit the asteroid spectrum , minor bands , and albedo . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a few percent ( less than 3% ) of orthopyroxene added to iron or pallasite meteorite , results in good spectral matches , reproducing the weak spectral feature around 0.9 @xmath0 m seen on 92 undina , 417 suevia , and 1124 stroobantia . for 337 devosa , </S>",
    "<S> a mixture model that better reproduces its spectral behavior and the 0.9 @xmath0 m feature is made with esquel pallasite enriched with goethite ( 2% ) .    </S>",
