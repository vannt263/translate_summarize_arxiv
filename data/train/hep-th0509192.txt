    "motivated mainly by the possibility of quantum gravity phenomenology @xcite , deformed ( or doubly ) special relativity @xcite has emerged recently as a possible description of the kinematics of quantum gravity , in the flat space approximation .",
    "the precise relation with the full theory , still to be constructed , is not yet fully understood @xcite ; however , in the 3d case solid arguments have been obtained for this to be the case @xcite , and even a rigorous derivation of some characterizing dsr features from a speicifi quantum gravity model has been obtained @xcite , and in the 4d case , although the situation is much less clear , interesting arguments have been found @xcite , confirming the reasons for the current interest in this model .",
    "the basic motivation for constructing such a model is the attempt to incorporate the presence of a non - zero invariant minimal length ( thought of as a remnant at the kinematical level of the underlying quantum gravity theory , and therefore usually identified with the planck length ) into the kinematical setting of special relativity , where the other invariant quantity , the speed of light , is present .",
    "the outcome of this deformation of special relativity to accommodate two invariant scales is first of all a modification of the symmetry group of the theory , that becomes the @xmath0-poincar group @xcite , and a consequent modification of dispersion relations for moving particles , of reaction thresholds of scattering processes , and a vast arena of new possibilities for testing quantum gravity models @xcite .",
    "a deformed symmetry group for spacetime can be equivalently seen @xcite as a non trivial metric on momentum space , that becomes curved and , more precisely , in the dsr case endowed with a de sitter ( or anti - desitter ) geometry .",
    "this has important consequences for the geometry of spacetime .",
    "defining spacetime coordinates ",
    "@xmath1 as lie derivatives over this curved momentum space , in other words by duality  with respect to momenta , they turn out to be non - commutative , being defined ( at least in one particular choice of basis @xcite ) by the cartan decomposition of the de sitter algebra into its lorentz subalgebra and the remnant ( the spacetime coordinates themselves ) . also , they have a non - trivial action on momentum space , characterized by a deformation parameter @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the planck length , i.e. the same deformation parameter appearing in the @xmath0-poincar algebra .",
    "spacetime acquires then , also in this approximately flat effective description , a quantum nature , and its geometry must be dealt with accordingly .",
    "indeed , the quantities @xmath1 are quantum _ operators _ , first of all , and their representations must be studied in order to study the properties of spacetime in this model , and are best understood not as coordinates  but as basic distance operators in spacetime ( with respect to a given origin ) , due also to their transformation properties under lorentz transformations ( they transform as 4-vectors ) .",
    "the study of their properties ( eigenstates , spectra , etc ) , and more generally of the quantum spacetime geometry of dsr , has been started in @xcite , using tools from the representation theory of the lorentz group in various dimensions .",
    "another issue that was discussed in @xcite is the notion of spacetime point  in a quantum spacetime , with its quantum nature reflected in the non - commutativity of the distance operators @xmath1 that we would use to localize points .",
    "the best definition available of a spacetime point in this quantum setting is that of a coherent state in the hilbert space of quantum states of geometry , being the representation space of the distance operators @xmath1 , which minimizes the uncertainty in all the @xmath1 themselves .",
    "indeed , we take this as a definition of a point in a quantum spacetime .",
    "in general one would expect a minimal simultaneous uncertainty , i.e. an uncertainty in the measurement of several spacetime coordinate , as for measuring a spacetime distance @xmath4 , of the form : l l_p ( ) ^ [ delta ] with @xmath5 in 3d and @xmath6 in 4d assuming the validity of the holographic principle , or @xmath6 in 3d and @xmath7 in 4d , not making this assumption ( the argument for this was reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "the exact form of the uncertainty relations is basis dependent in dsr , i.e. it depends on the precise definition of the @xmath1 operators @xcite one chooses . in the so - called @xmath0-minkowski basis ,",
    "in which the @xmath1 form a lie algebra , the notion of coherent state and minimal uncertainty is straightforward to implement and was indeed obtained in @xcite ; however , in this basis the interpretation of the @xmath1 as distance operators is not immediate and the geometric meaning of the is more obscure . on the other hand , in the snyder basis ,",
    "to which we were referring above , obtained by cartan decomposition , this interpretation is clear , but the construction of coherent states , i.e. the identification of what is a spacetime point , is more technically involved and the framework of generalized coherent states on lie groups @xcite has to be used .    the procedure for constructing a system of coherent states is ( briefly ) the following : given a lie group @xmath8 and a representation @xmath9 of it acting on the hilbert space @xmath10 , with a fixed vector @xmath11 in it , the system of states @xmath12 is a system of coherent states .",
    "the point is then to identify which are the states @xmath13 that are closest to classical , in the sense that they minimize the invariant dispersion or variance @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the invariant quadratic casimir of the group @xmath8 .",
    "the general requirement is the following : call @xmath16 the algebra of @xmath8 , @xmath17 its complexification , @xmath18 the isotropy subalgebra of the state @xmath11 , i.e. the set of elements @xmath19 in @xmath17 such that @xmath20 , with @xmath21 a complex number , and @xmath22 the subalgebra of @xmath17 conjugate to @xmath18 ; then the state @xmath11 is closest to the classical states if it is most symmetrical , that is if @xmath23 , i.e. if the isotropy subalgebra @xmath18 is maximal .    in this paper , we tackle exactly the problem of defining points in a quantum spacetime with the formalism of coherent states using these general techniques .",
    "in the first part of the paper we construct coherent states minimizing the spacetime uncertainty relations ( thus representing semi - classical points ) for 3d dsr , first in the euclidean setting and then in the minkowskian one , our construction being based on the fact that the momentum space in 3d dsr is given by the @xmath24 group manifold in the euclidean and by the @xmath25 group manifold in the minkowskian ; then we show a similar construction based instead on the homogeneous space @xmath26 in the euclidean and on @xmath27 in the minkowskian , that gives similar results and represents in a slightly simplified context the same construction that one would perform for 4d dsr .",
    "we confine ourselves to the 3-dimensional case purely for greater simplicity of the relevant calculations , which become much more involved in higher dimensions ; however we stress that no major conceptual or technical difference is expected in the more realistic case of 4 spacetime dimensions , or in higher ones for what matters ; these cases can be in principle handled using the same tools and with the same procedure .",
    "in 3d deformed special relativity ( dsr ) , the momentum space @xmath28 is simply the group manifold @xmath24 .",
    "the hilbert space of wave functions ( say , for a point particle living in the dsr spacetime ) in the momentum polarization is then the space of @xmath29 functions over @xmath24 equipped with the haar measure : @xmath30 . in the framework of spin foam quantization",
    ", it has been shown that this curved momentum space structure can be derived directly from 3d ( riemannian ) quantum gravity coupled to matter @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the effective theory describing the matter propagation , after integration over the gravity degrees of freedom , is a dsr theory invariant under a @xmath0-deformation of the poincar algebra , where the deformation parameter @xmath0 is simply related to the newton constant for gravity and therefore to the planck length .    in this context",
    ", the curved momentum space naturally leads to a deformation of the rule of addition of momenta . indeed",
    "the addition of momenta will not be the simple @xmath31 addition anymore , but will be defined by the multiplication on the @xmath24 group .",
    "more technically , the standard convention is to define the 3-momentum @xmath32 from the @xmath24 group element as follow : g(p ) i d + i .v , where @xmath33 are the usual pauli matrices and @xmath0 the planck mass .",
    "then the deformed addition of momenta @xmath34 is given by : g(p_1p_2 ) g(p_1)g(p_2 ) , or more explicitly : @xmath35 this leads to a deformation of the law of conservation of energy - momentum , which is interpreted as due to the gravitational interaction .",
    "in the present work , we are interested by the dual structure to the momentum space , and we would like to describe the space(-time ) structure of the 3d dsr theory . given the @xmath36 group structure of momentum space , there is a preferred choice for the coordinates , that in a sense combines the virtues of the snyder basis and of the @xmath0-minkowski basis for 4d dsr .",
    "the coordinates @xmath37 are now operators acting on the hilbert space @xmath38 and more precisely , they are the translation operators on the group manifold @xmath24 , as in the snyder basis : @xmath39 are the standard @xmath40 algebra generators , which are represented by the pauli matrices @xmath33 in the fundamental two - dimensional representation , and @xmath41 is the 3d planck length .",
    "the spacetime coordinates are now non - commutative : = il_p_ijkx_k , and obviously form a lie algebra , just as in the @xmath0-minkowski basis of 4d dsr , and also the bracket between positions and momenta is deformed : = -i_ij+ il_p_ijkp_k .",
    "the ( squared ) spacetime length operator @xmath42 is actually the casimir operator of @xmath24 .",
    "it is invariant under @xmath24 and commutes with the coordinates @xmath37 .",
    "its spectrum is of course @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , while the spectrum of the @xmath37 coordinate operators is simply @xmath45 .",
    "this way , one can view this non - commutative spacetime as implementing a minimal length @xmath46 and a discrete structure of spacetime .",
    "note also that this quantum spacetime structure is analogous to the one discovered in 3d loop quantum gravity and spin foam models , and was indeed studied as a simplified version of it , with its lorentz invariance analysed in detail , in @xcite .",
    "because the spacetime coordinates do not commute with each other anymore , we can not simultaneously diagonalize the @xmath37 s and localize the three coordinates of a point / particle perfectly at the same time .",
    "so we face the issue of how to define a point . in order to be able to talk about a spacetime point , as it was proposed in @xcite , we need to introduce coherent states minimizing the uncertainty in the @xmath37 s , which will define a notion of semi - classical points in a non - commutative geometry . actually ,",
    "coherent states for lie groups , and especially @xmath24 , are well - known and we will review the material presented by perelomov @xcite from our own perspective ; coherent states for the algebra generated by the @xmath37 operators , named the fuzzy sphereand considered as a paradigmatic example of a non - commutative spacetime , were constructed using a different approach in @xcite .      starting with the @xmath40 algebra @xmath47\\,=\\ , il_p\\,\\epsilon_{ijk}x_k$ ]",
    ", we get the following uncertainty relations for @xmath48 : ( x_i)^2(x_j)^2_ijkx_k^2 .",
    "[ uncertaintyij ] summing all these uncertainty relations over @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( possibly equal ) , we obtain : @xmath51 where we have introduced the distance @xmath52 and the uncertainty @xmath53 .",
    "finally , we have derived the following uncertainty relation : ( l)^2l_pl .",
    "this provides us with a first bound on the uncertainty , which suggests a generic feature of the localization of spacetime points : we can not localize a space point at a distance @xmath54 from us with an uncertainty smaller than of the order of @xmath55 .",
    "actually , computing the uncertainty exactly over the quantum states , we will find in the following that the true minimal spread is simply @xmath56 .",
    "this is simply due to the term @xmath57 .",
    "states diagonalizing @xmath58 are the usual @xmath59 , where @xmath50 is the spin label and @xmath60 the angular momentum projection over the @xmath61 direction .",
    "it is easy to check the expectation values of the coordinate operators on such states : x_1_j , m = x_2_j , m=0 , x_3_j , m = ml_p .",
    "therefore such states correspond geometrically to points located along the @xmath61 axis at ( non - invariant ) distance @xmath62 .",
    "the spread of the state or its uncertainty ( which determines the precision of its localization ) is defined as : l =",
    ". then we easily compute : ( l)_j , m = l_p , which is minimal for @xmath63 ( and for @xmath64 ) . in other words ,",
    "the maximal ( or minimal ) weight states @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) are the coherent states for @xmath24 minimizing the uncertainties in the positions and thus are the semi - classical states for 3d euclidean dsr , i.e. the best definition of spacetime points in the corresponding quantum spacetime .",
    "of course , these correspond to someof the points of this quantum spacetime , those at the location mentioned above . on such states",
    ", we have : @xmath67 which confirms the fact that these quantum points are approximately localized at a spacetime distance @xmath68 from the origin , i.e from the location of the observer , and we derive the relation for large distance : l~.    this relation is exactly the one expected from the holographic principle in 3d , as mentioned in the introduction . we stress that the uncertainty is actually substantially larger than the planck length @xmath46 , as expected from several arguments about quantum measurements in the context of general relativity @xcite .",
    "now we want to define all the other points of our quantum spacetime , i.e. construct all the other coherent states minimizing the spacetime uncertainty relations , following the perelomov construction , according to which the full coherent states system is obtained from the vector invariant under the maximal subalgebra by the action of a group transformation .",
    "more technically , we define the ( coherent ) states : |j , ^2e^j_+ -|j_-|j , j=_m =- j^+j ( ) ^|j , m , with the following notations : @xmath69 using the explicit expression , one can check that : @xmath70 or more simply : x _",
    "this means that the above states corresponds to the points located at a distance @xmath71 in the direction @xmath72 from the origin , and the set of all these states spans the 2-sphere of radius @xmath71 centered in the origin .",
    "we can compute the overlap between two coherent states and we obtain : j,|j,= e^i(,)()^j , where the phase is @xmath73 with @xmath74 the area of the geodesic triangle on the sphere @xmath75 with vertices given by @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "these states are truly the @xmath24 semiclassical coherent states , meaning that they saturate ( minimize ) the uncertainty relation @xmath79 induced by the commutation relation @xmath80=il_p\\,x_3 $ ] , as well as the others obtained by cyclic permutations of these coordinate operators . and",
    "finally , they form a resolution of unity : ^2|j , j,|= id_j , where @xmath81 is the identity on the hilbert space @xmath82 of the spin-@xmath50 representation ( whose basis vectors are the @xmath59 , @xmath83 ) . this confirms ( it is the algebraic characterization of this ) that they exhaust all the points of the 2-sphere of radius @xmath68 around the origin of our quantum spacetime . from this one can prove that the set of _ all _ states of this form , for _ all _ values of @xmath50 , span the whole quantum spacetime under consideration ; in other words , one can prove , using the peter - weyl measure for weighting each representation @xmath50 , that this system of coherent states provides us with a resolution of unity on the full hilbert space @xmath38 : @xmath84 this is actually a positive - operator - valued - measure ( povm ) .",
    "indeed the projection operator @xmath85 allows the simultaneous measurement of the three spacetime coordinates @xmath86 , even though this measurement is not sharp since the states @xmath87 have a non - vanishing overlap .",
    "these operators allow us to localize a spacetime point with an uncertainty @xmath88 depending on the distance @xmath54 to the origin .",
    "this gives a special role to the observer , who is located at the origin .",
    "we also note that a similar analysis of the ( quantum ) point structure of a non - commutative spacetime in terms of povms was performed by toller in @xcite .",
    "we would like to end this section on the remark that to go from one point @xmath89 of our non - commutative spacetime to another point @xmath90 , we actually simply do a @xmath24 rotation @xmath91 , which takes @xmath77 to @xmath78 i.e. we use the position operators @xmath92 themselves to generate a spacetime translation .",
    "this let us move along the 2-sphere of of radius @xmath71 .",
    "nevertheless , we see that these special translations do not allow us to change the value of the distance @xmath50 and to go from one state at @xmath93 to another at @xmath94 : for this we would need the momentum operators @xmath95 .",
    "we discuss briefly below why the action of the momentum operators on these states is not easy to analyze .",
    "let us sum up the situation for this euclidean 3d deformed special relativity .",
    "the momentum space is @xmath24 and the hilbert space @xmath38 of wave functions of the theory is @xmath96 .",
    "an orthogonal basis of @xmath38 is provided by the matrix elements of the group elements in all the representations of @xmath24 , we note them @xmath97 : @xmath98 to normalize this states , we multiply them by a factor @xmath99",
    ". functions of the momentum @xmath91 ( or @xmath32 ) acts by multiplication @xmath100 while the position operators",
    "@xmath101 acts as derivations @xmath102 or equivalently @xmath103 as the operator @xmath104 acts on the left , it acts only on @xmath105 and leaves @xmath19 invariant .",
    "therefore , keeping @xmath19 fixed , the whole previous analysis of @xmath24 coherent states applies to the vector @xmath106 : states having a minimal spacetime spread are @xmath107 .",
    "now , an important remark is that the standard translations @xmath108 do not map a coherent state to another coherent state , or that the system of coherent states is not invariant under the action of the standard translations . in a sense",
    "we can thus say that the system of coherent states @xmath109 is relative to a given observer ( located at the origin ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath110 acts simply by multiplication on the matrix elements : d^j_ab(g ) = e^i(g)d^j_ab(g ) = e^(g)d^j_ab(g ) , where we take the trace in the fundamental two - dimensional representation , but the function @xmath111 decomposes into matrix elements of all possible representations of @xmath24 . on the other hand , we can introduce the simpler operators given by multiplication by the matrix elements themselves @xmath112 .",
    "however we can not interpret them as translation operators in a straightforward way .",
    "overall , it appears that it is not straightforward at all to define translation operators that have a simple action on the coherent states .",
    "coherent states for this euclidean spacetime based on the @xmath40 algebra representing semi - classical points were actually already proposed in @xcite ( although the authors did not recognize them as the highest weight vectors @xmath113 as written by perelomov ) , where the authors also investigate the possibility of writing a poincar covariant differential calculus .",
    "a topic of special interest is the plane waves .",
    "more precisely , from the perspective of measuring the difference between a plane wave in flat commutative spacetime from a plane wave in non - commutative space , it is interesting to compare the expectation value @xmath114 for fixed momentum @xmath32 on a coherent state to its classical value @xmath115 .    explicitly computing these expectation values on a semi - classical state",
    "@xmath87 satisfying @xmath116 , we find : e^ip.x= e^ijl_pp .",
    "= ( ( l_pp . ) + i(l_pp.))^j , ( ip.x)= ( + i ) ^2j .",
    "it is straightforward to check that in the classical limit @xmath117 , the two expressions have the same asymptotical behavior as @xmath118 .",
    "noting @xmath119 and @xmath120 , we can write : @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "this is to be compared to @xmath123 .",
    "the first difference is the intensity i.e the modulus of @xmath124 is not one : it presents an anisotropy centered around the direction set by the momentum @xmath32 and increases with its norm .",
    "the modulus being always inferior to 1 , it will go to 0 as the distance @xmath50 grows : we will have a damping of the plane wave as the distance from the origin grows , which should be a visible effect of the non - commutative geometry .",
    "the difference in the phases @xmath125 and @xmath126 is rather small , but will eventually blow up ( linearly ) as the distance @xmath50 gets large .     for @xmath127 and @xmath128 then @xmath129 as a function of the angle @xmath130 between @xmath131 and @xmath132.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   for @xmath127 and @xmath128 then @xmath129 as a function of the angle @xmath130 between @xmath131 and @xmath132.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "lorentzian 3d deformed special relativity is very similar to the euclidean one .",
    "it is now the non - compact group manifold @xmath25 that is identified as momentum space , and again one can select a preferred set of spacetime coordinate operators given by the lie derivatives acting on this group manifold .",
    "we introduce the rotation generator @xmath133 and the two boost generators @xmath134 , which satisfy the @xmath135 algebra : @xmath136=\\pm k_\\pm,\\qquad [ k_+,k_-]=-2j_z,\\ ] ] where @xmath137 . in the following",

    "the addition of momenta is defined by the group multiplication : @xmath150 and leads to the same deformation as the euclidean theory in the case of time - like momenta .",
    "the spacetime coordinates are once more defined as the lie algebra generators ( see also @xcite ) , which produce the translations on @xmath25 : @xmath151 the ( spacetime ) ( squared ) length operator is @xmath152 and is actually the casimir operator of @xmath25 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath9 is discrete @xmath45 while the the spectra of the space coordinate remains continuous @xmath153 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath29 is more involved and consists of two distinct series :    * positive discrete eigenvalues : states @xmath59 with @xmath154 correspond to the discrete principal series of irreducible representations of @xmath25 .",

    "the positive series have @xmath133-eigenvalues @xmath60 larger than @xmath50 while the negative series have @xmath155 .",
    "the value of the casimir operator is @xmath156 ; accordingly , the eigenstates belonging to this series have the geometric interpretation of defining timelike spacetime points with respect to the origin , with the positive series corresponding to points in the future half of the lightcone , and the negative series to points in the past half of it ; * negative continuous eigenvalues : states @xmath157 with @xmath158 correspond to the continuous principal series of irreducible representations of @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath133-eigenvalues @xmath60 takes all values in @xmath159 .",
    "the value of the casimir operator is @xmath160 , and accordingly the the corresponding eigenstates are interpreted as spacelike spacetime points .",
    "we have therefore a quantum spacetime with a discrete time - like structure ; moreover , while we have a minimal space - like space - time distance @xmath161 , the space coordinates @xmath162 and @xmath163 can take any value in @xmath164 .",
    "this situation is thus exactly the same as that related to the length operator in ( 2 + 1)-d loop quantum gravity @xcite , as to be expected since the quantum geometric structure is based on the group @xmath165 also in that case .",
    "now we are interested in constructing states with minimal spread .",
    "we define the uncertainty as previously : l=. we consider the time - like case first .",
    "we can easily evaluate the distance and uncertainty on the basis states @xmath59 , @xmath166 : @xmath167 therefore we reach the minimal spread for the lowest weight vector @xmath63 in the positive discrete series of representations",
    ". it would be the maximal weight @xmath64 for the negative discrete series of representations . for time - like distances",
    ", we can conclude that : ( l)_min= ( l)_j , j = l_p~ , which reproduces the result from the euclidean theory . for space - like vectors , the basis vectors @xmath157 give : @xmath168 is always larger than @xmath54 .",
    "we conclude that the eigenvector basis of @xmath9 is not the right basis to investigate coherent states for space - like distances , or in other words points located at a spacelike distance from the origin ( where the observer is located ) .",
    "the interpretation of this result is not completely clear ( to us at least ) , but it is tempting to speculate that this is due to the fact that an observer located at the origin of the reference frame ( spacetime coordinate operators ) we are using has no physical mean to measure events that are spacelike to her , and accordingly no identification of points outside her lightcone is possible ; therefore what seems at first sight a purely mathematical accident or a formal difficulty may instead be a result of causality restrictions and a confirmation of the consistency of the whole quantum geometric scheme . as in the euclidean case , we can now construct the whole system of coherent states applying perelomov procedure , starting from the semiclassical coherent states identified above ; we define time - like coherent states @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) unit time - like hyperboloid . to get to @xmath87",
    ", we simply act on @xmath65 by an @xmath165 group element which maps the vector @xmath171 , pointing to the origin of the hyperboloid , to the vector @xmath72 .",
    "there is a @xmath172 ambiguity in defining this group element , corresponding to the group transformations leaving the vectors on the hyperboloid invariant , so that the relevant group transformations are the boosts only ; this gives a phase ambiguity in the definition of @xmath87 .",
    "the sign @xmath145 corresponds to the choice of sign of the discrete representation we use .",
    "these states have all the nice properties of the @xmath24 coherent states , including the resolution of unity .",
    "we can write explicitly these coherent states as : @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the euler @xmath174-function",

    "in addition , one can compute the overlap between two such states : |j,|j,|^2= ( ) ^-2j .",
    "we see that the whole construction and its results are the exact analogue of those of the euclidean theory , for these discrete timelike quantum points .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite , where it is also described how to build a system coherent states for the continuous representations using functions over the lobachevsky plane @xmath178 , using a different basis of states , i.e. eigenstates of different spacetime coordinate operators , in agreement with the geometric interpretation proposed above .    to sum up",
    ", the quantum spacetime of lorentzian dsr is a non - commutative spacetime with a discrete time structure . in this context",

    "simple _ representations of @xmath190 due to the required @xmath186-invariance .",

    "the vector @xmath193 is the @xmath186-invariant vector of the simple representation @xmath191 and ensures that @xmath194 is truly a function on the coset @xmath26 .",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath29 are always positive as expected .",

    "we can define an invariant uncertainty , which is the lie algebra uncertainty@xcite : = ^2+^2 - ^2- ^2 , which gives : _ j , m=4n(n+1)-m^2 .",
    "this uncertainty is minimal when for the highest weight @xmath204 , for which we have @xmath205 .",
    "nevertheless , it is not exactly the uncertainty which interests us .",
    "physically , we are more interested into the position uncertainty : ( x)^2=^2 - ^2=l_p^2(^2 - ^2 ) . on the states @xmath202 ,",
    "the mean value of the position vanishes so that @xmath206 : ( x)^2_j , m = l_p^2(4n(n+1)-j(j+1 ) ) , which is minimal for the largest representation @xmath207 , for which we have : @xmath208    from these results , it appears that the length spectrum is quite misleading .",
    "all the length eigenvectors @xmath199 are centered around the spacetime origin and the value of @xmath209 gives the ( square of the ) uncertainty / spread of the state .",
    "we have just seen that states in the canonical basis for simple representations of @xmath190 can be interpreted as giving a definition of a quantum point defining the origin of our non - commutative spacetime .",
    "the next task is to identify coherent states that correspond to arbitrary ( quantum ) points in spacetime , localized with greater or lesser degree of uncertainty .",
    "the idea is to consider arbitrary combinations of basis states , and more precisely states that can be obtained from these by acting with generic group elements ( in the appropriate representation , of course ) . in other words",
    "we will be considering states of the type : @xmath210 and consider the mean value of the coordinate distance operators on them , in order to check that they correspond indeed to points distinguished from the origin , and then the corresponding dispersion in these operators to check their degree of localization .    in this riemannian setting",
    ", we consider group elements @xmath211 corresponding to the exponentiation of a given lie algebra element @xmath183 . for @xmath212",
    ", we can compute : @xmath213 which allows us to derive explicitly the exact expression of the average position and spread of the state @xmath214 : k_1_njm = 0 , k_2_njm = m , k_3_njm=0 , ^2=m^2 ^ 2 , ( k_1)^2_njm&= & , + ( k_2)^2_njm&= & , + ( k_3)^2_njm&=&(j(j+1)-m^2 ) + ^2 , + ( k)^2_njm & = & ( k_1)^2+(j(j+1)-m^2 ) + , with the factors @xmath215 given in appendix .",
    "therefore , our state @xmath216 corresponds to a point localized around the @xmath217 axis at distance @xmath218 from the origin ( remember that the labels @xmath50 and @xmath60 refer to the choice of canonical basis with respect to the operator @xmath219 ) .",
    "an analogous calculation for the state @xmath220 would of course show that it corresponds to a point localized around the @xmath221 axis at the same distance , and one could of course define states located at non - zero distance along the @xmath61 axis .",
    "let us have a closer look at the uncertainty of these states .",
    "taking as angle @xmath222 , the expressions simplify : @xmath223 @xmath224,\\ ] ] @xmath225 as far as @xmath226 is concerned , we have the same formulas as in the case of @xmath24 coherent states .",
    "this is rather natural since @xmath227 rotates @xmath228 into @xmath219 .",
    "and we reach a minimal uncertainty in @xmath226 when @xmath60 is set to its maximal value @xmath50 .",
    "we then have : = jl_p(0,1,0),(x)=l_p .",
    "we get a spread @xmath229 of @xmath230 outset by @xmath231",
    ". then the minimal value of @xmath232 is obtained for the maximal values of the labels @xmath204 , in which case we get : = 2nl_p(0,1,0),(x)=l_p = , with the same square - root law dependence of the uncertainty @xmath233 that we had found in the 3d dsr case on the ( average ) distance @xmath234 from the origin .",
    "a more careful analysis , allowing @xmath130 to vary and using the explicit formula for @xmath235 , shows that again the minimal uncertainty @xmath236 for a fixed angle @xmath130 is again obtained for the maximal values of the labels @xmath204 . in this case",
    "it is straightforward to get : @xmath237 the minimal relative uncertainty is obviously obtained when @xmath238 , i.e. when @xmath239 $ ] .",
    "using the same techniques one can study coherent states defining arbitrary points ( not located around any specific coordinate axis ) in this quantum flat spacetime .",
    "this concludes our analysis of coherent states in this euclidean snyder model for a non - commutative flat geometry in a 3d spacetime . we have constructed coherent states minimizing the position uncertainty around arbitrary spacetime positions and we derived a square - root law relating the ( minimal ) spread of localization of spacetime points to their ( average ) distance from the origin . at the end of the day , this seems to be a generic feature of these non - commutative 3d geometries .      a natural question , that the reader might ask , is the link between the earlier dsr theory using the group @xmath24 as momentum space and the present snyder theory based on the homogeneous space @xmath240 .",
    "indeed as manifold , the two momentum spaces are isomorphic .",
    "so what is the precise difference ?",
    "in fact , the snyder formalism allows a great freedom in what one can call coordinate operators .",
    "indeed we can choose any set of three generators @xmath37 of the translations on @xmath241 .",
    "the standard snyder coordinates are the boosts : @xmath242 nevertheless , one can also define some @xmath40 coordinates , which we call here the dsr coordinates : @xmath243 these are the generators of the translations on @xmath241 identified with the group manifold @xmath24 given by the generators of the right @xmath24 subgroup of the initial @xmath190 symmetry group . note that we could have also chosen the left @xmath40 generators @xmath244 .",
    "the coherent states we have defined for 3d dsr refer indeed to this particular choice of spacetime coordinates operators .",
    "once the spacetime coordinate operators are chosen , we then have a freedom in the precise definition of the momentum , more exactly in the choice of mapping between points in @xmath241 and the standard ( measurable ) momentum @xmath245 ; this is the well - known ambiguity in the choice of basis for a dsr theory ( see @xcite for a discussion of this feature of dsr theories and for possible resolutions of this ambiguity ) .",
    "let us move on to the lorentzian case and repeat the same steps as in the previous riemannian case .",
    "the momentum space is now defined as the one - sheet lorentzian hyperboloid @xmath246 and the position are defined as the boostgenerators : x_0j_03,x_1j_13,x_2j_23 .",
    "the ( squared ) length @xmath247 is invariant under the 3d lorentz group @xmath248 and is equal to the difference of the @xmath249 second casimir operator and the @xmath248 casimir operator .",
    "thus its spectrum is obtained by decomposing the @xmath249 representations involved in the harmonic analysis over the hyperboloid @xmath250 into @xmath248 representations . as explained in appendix ,",
    "such simple @xmath249 representations are of two kinds : we have a continuous series labeled by a real parameter @xmath251 and a discrete series labeled by a half - integer @xmath252 . following the decomposition of the simple representations into @xmath248 representations given in appendix , the spectrum associated to",
    "the continuous series is : ^2| , s , m=-(^2 + 1)+(s^2+)=s^2-^2- , where @xmath253 runs in @xmath254 and @xmath255 is the half - integer ( @xmath256 weight ) labeling the basis of the @xmath248 representations .",
    "the discrete simple representations give : ^2|n , s , m=(n^2 - 1)+(s^2+)=n^2+s^2- , with @xmath257 and @xmath255 , and : ^2|n , j , m=(n^2 - 1)+(-j^2+)=n^2-j^2- , with @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "let us point out the important fact that the discrete simple representations always carry positive @xmath29 eigenvalues which correspond to _ spacelike _ distances .",
    "the simple continuous representations are more subtle to interpret .    just as in the euclidean case",
    ", such length eigenvector can be proved to be centered around the origin . more precisely",
    ", one can check that : _",
    "3,i_2,m|x_|i_3,i_2,m = 0 = m|j_01|m = m|j_02|m , m|j_12|m = m , where @xmath260 denotes the considered representation @xmath261 .",
    "the uncertainty / spreadof these states are thus entirely exactly given by the length operator : @xmath262 .",
    "taking into account only the spacelike sector defined by the discrete simple representations , we get that , once the @xmath249 representation is fixed to a given @xmath263 , the minimal uncertainty is obtained for the maximal value @xmath264 for which we have : ( x)_min==1 .      as in the riemannian case",
    ", quantum states to be identified with arbitrary points in the non - commutative lorentzian spacetime of dsr can be obtained considering combinations of basis states defined by applying a generic group transformation to them @xmath265 .",
    "again , the @xmath248 subgroup of the @xmath249 symmetry group of momentum space acts trivially ( in the sense that it will not change the expectation values of the coordinates @xmath266 ) and the non - trivial action is only that of transformations generated by the operators @xmath267 , @xmath268 and @xmath269 and their linear combinations .",
    "let us start by having a look at vectors of the type @xmath270 .",
    "then we can compute : ( -ij_13)x_0(+ij_13)&=&x_0-j_01 , + ( -ij_13)x_1(+ij_13)&=&x_1 , + ( -ij_13)x_2(+ij_13)&=&x_2+j_12 . on basis states @xmath271 of simple representations , only the ( diagonalized )",
    "rotation @xmath272 have a non - zero expectation value .",
    "therefore , similarly to the riemannian case , we realize that a rotation @xmath273 will generate states located around the spacetime point @xmath274 on the @xmath217 axis .",
    "let us look at the spread of these states .",
    "we will only do the explicit calculation for an angle @xmath222 .",
    "@xmath275 obviously vanishes .",
    "then we obtain : @xmath276 where @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",
    "computing @xmath279 is more complicated and requires the exact action of the @xmath249 boost operators in the representation @xmath280 .",
    "focusing on @xmath281 , we see that the continuous @xmath248 representations @xmath282 do not lead to any interesting uncertainty result , while the discrete @xmath248 representations @xmath283 give a minimal uncertainty when @xmath60 reaches its minimal value @xmath284",
    ". then we obtain : @xmath285 and we recover a square - root law for the spread in time of a spacetime point localized at a spacelike separation from the origin .",
    "it would be interesting to finally compute the spread @xmath286 to close the analysis .",
    "had we rotated the basis states using @xmath287 , we would have found a state localized around a point on the @xmath221 axis , and the analysis would have proceeded analogously . finally ,",
    "if we want to construct a state localized around a point on the timelike axis @xmath288 , we would need to start with a state which is not an eigenstate of @xmath272 .",
    "for example , we can first do a @xmath289 and then a @xmath290 ( or vice - versa ) . calculating the effect of such a transformation on @xmath267",
    ", we would get a contribution from the action of @xmath272 , which has a non - vanishing expectation value .",
    "we leave the study of the details of this construction and of the properties of such states for future investigation .",
    "looking more closely at the states centered around the origin @xmath271 , we remind that the covariant spread of a state labeled with representations of the continuous series @xmath291 reads : ( x)^2=-l_p^2(^2 + 1)+(s^2+)=l_p^2(s^2-^2- ) .",
    "this squared uncertainty on the position can be positive , or negative or even zero .",
    "let us remind that we are in a lorentzian metric , and that @xmath292 is thus positive when spacelike , negative when timelike and vanishes when null - like .",
    "we would like to insist on the fact that @xmath293 does not mean that we have perfectly localized the spacetime point and that we should look at the individual uncertainties for each coordinate to have a proper geometric interpretation of the state under consideration .",
    "moreover , looking at the above expression of the uncertainty @xmath236 , it is not obvious that the planck length @xmath46 is a minimal scale for spacetime localization measurements . for this purpose ,",
    "we can introduce a notion of _ space uncertainty _ :",
    "( x)^2_sp(x_1)^2 + ( x_2)^2 .",
    "this uncertainty is obviously not a lorentz invariant .",
    "nevertheless , its minimum is of course invariant .    now",
    "the commutation relation of @xmath294 and @xmath295 is simply @xmath296=il_p^2 j_{12}=il_p^2 j_3 $ ] ; this means that @xmath297 , @xmath298 and @xmath272 form an @xmath40 algebra .",
    "we can therefore perform with identical results our analysis of @xmath24 coherent states : the state minimizing the uncertainty relation induced by @xmath296=il_p^2 j_{12}$ ] are the coherent states @xmath299 , where @xmath300 labels the @xmath24 representation , @xmath301 the maximal weight vector and @xmath91 an arbitrary @xmath24 transformation .",
    "computing @xmath302 on such states , we thus obtain : @xmath303 the minimum is reached for @xmath304 if working with @xmath24 ( or @xmath305 if working with @xmath186 ) . in the end",
    "this means that there exists a non - contractible minimal uncertainty for the localization of a point in space given by : _",
    "and we conclude that the planck length @xmath46 effectively appears as a minimal length scale in space ; we can not resolve the space coordinates of any event in spacetime with a better accuracy than @xmath306 .",
    "in this work we have analyzed some properties of the quantum geometry corresponding to 3-dimensional dsr ( deformed or doubly special relativity ) in both the riemannian and lorentzian setting , and in particular we tackled the issue of defining a suitable notion of quantum pointsin the relevant quantum spacetime , out of the appropriate definition of distance and coordinate operators .",
    "dsr models are presently understood as ( candidates for ) effective descriptions of quantum gravity in the weak - gravity limit , that take nevertheless into account the presence of an invariant distance or energy scale ( the planck scale ) coming from the full theory .",
    "being based on a curved momentum space and on a deformed symmetry group for spacetime , the configuration space of such models , i.e. the spacetime they describe , is naturally quantum and non - commutative .",
    "a careful analysis of such quantum flat spacetime and of its quantum geometry is needed and important for basically three reasons : 1 ) any proper understanding of physical processes in a dsr setting that might have phenomenological interest , and thus tell us something about the underlying fundamental quantum gravity theory , requires a clear spacetime description , as all the processes we are interested in from a physical perspective are understood as happening in spacetime ; 2 ) the role of the lorentz group and the way lorentz invariance is realized , or modified to be compatible with the planck scale , in quantum gravity is best studied in spacetime terms , since our most intuitive notion of lorentz transformations is as spacetime symmetries ; 3 ) the properties of the dsr quantum spacetime and of the dsr quantum geometry can be compared with those unveiled by more fundamental theories of quantum gravity and with more general features of a quantum spacetime as suggested by other approaches ( such as loop quantum gravity or spin foam models or string theory ) ; on the one hand this can suggest us which of these approaches is on the right track ( by giving us means to analyze in a simplified context and then test experimentally some of their predictions ) or which features of a quantum spacetime we should hope to describe with a more fundamental theory ; on the other hand this can help us to understand how a dsr effective description may arise from any of these more fundamental theories in a rigorous way .",
    "the second issue , regarding the role and implementation of lorentz invariance , was studied in @xcite , together with the geometric interpretation and some properties of spacetime coordinate operators in dsr , thus starting off the analysis of its quantum spacetime geometry . in this paper",
    "we have carried this analysis further by studying the basic ingredient of a spacetime : points .",
    "the starting point was the idea that in quantum spacetime , such as the dsr one , the only notion of a pointis that of a coherent state corresponding to a given non - zero values of the distance ( spacetime coordinate ) operators , and which is semi - classical in the sense that it minimizes the uncertainty in the simultaneous determination ( measurement ) of such operators .",
    "therefore we proceeded to construct these states and to study their properties looking for a consistent geometric interpretation of them .    in the case of riemannian 3d dsr the construction",
    "is based on the fact that the dsr momentum space is an @xmath241 manifold endowed with and @xmath24 group structure , so that the corresponding hilbert space of wave functions is @xmath307 endowed with an appropriate action of @xmath24 ; using the harmonic analysis on @xmath241 and the representation theory of @xmath24 we have constructed the system of coherent states for this hilbert space and identified the semiclassical ones , and we have discussed in detail the geometric meaning of their properties .",
    "the same construction was performed in the slightly more involved case of lorentzian 3d dsr , based instead on the @xmath25 group structure ; here a careful distinction of timelike and spacelike structures and points is needed and to see how this is realized at the quantum level is very interesting ; we have indeed performed again the whole construction of coherent states and studied with the same tools as in the riemannian case their quantum geometric properties , and again uncovered the point structureof the dsr quantum spacetime , this time revealing also its quantum causality in terms of ligthcones .    both in the riemannian and lorentzian case we have pointed out an interesting square - root dependence of the quantum localization uncertainty , i.e. of the spread of coordinate operators for semiclassical coherent states ( quantum points ) around their mean values ( classical points ) , on the distance itself .",
    "this is what one would have expected from arguments based _",
    "holographic principle _ and may thus be a hint of a kind of _ intrinsic fundamental holography _ of a quantum spacetime .    as a preliminary step towards analyzing the quantum spacetime geometry of 4d dsr , we have then considered coherent states for the hilbert spaces given by @xmath308 and @xmath309 , where the relevant group actions are represented by @xmath190 and @xmath249 respectively ; this is because in 4d dsr momentum space is indeed given by 4d de sitter space ( or the 4-sphere in the riemannian case ) with the de sitter ( or @xmath310 ) group structure . in this context",
    "we have again constructed the system of coherent states and analyzed their properties and their geometric interpretation , comparing the results with those obtained previously ; we have shown how the construction proceeds in the so - called snyder coordinates ( the construction of coherent states in @xmath0-minkowski coordinates was performed in the 4-dimensional case in @xcite ) .",
    "the extension of this construction and these results to the 4-dimensional case is more technically and computationally involved but would proceed in complete analogy .    our analysis and results nicely complement , we think , previous work on the quantum geometry of non - commutative spacetimes , and on the notion of points in such a context .",
    "in particular we have in mind the important work of majid @xcite for the fuzzy sphere and that of toller @xcite for the snyder spacetime .",
    "in fact , we have constructed the same coherent states and differential calculus that majid studied for the @xmath40 lie algebra treated as a non - commutative space , but using different tools , ours being simply based on the representation theory of lie groups and not on the theory of quantum groups ; also we have seen that our identification of quantum points ( coherent states ) uses the tool of povms , which is the main tool used also by toller in his analysis .",
    "it would be very interesting to deepen the comparison between these various approaches with ours and to extend in this way our results .",
