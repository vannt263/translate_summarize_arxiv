    "astronomers have been making telescopic observations of sunspots since the time of galileo , gradually building a historical record showing a periodic rise and fall in the number of sunspots every 11 years .",
    "we now know that sunspots are regions with an enhanced local magnetic field , so this 11-year cycle actually traces a variation in surface magnetism .",
    "attempts to understand this behavior theoretically often invoke a combination of differential rotation , convection , and meridional flow to modulate the field through a magnetic dynamo ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite was the first to demonstrate that many solar - type stars exhibit long - term cyclic variations in their ca  ii  h  &  k emission , analogous to the solar variations .",
    "significant progress in dynamo modeling could only occur after helioseismology provided meaningful constraints on the sun s interior structure and dynamics @xcite .",
    "variations in the mean strength of the solar magnetic field lead to significant shifts ( @xmath50.5  @xmath2hz ) in the frequencies of even the lowest - degree p - modes @xcite .",
    "space - based asteroseismology missions , such as most @xcite , corot @xcite , and kepler @xcite , as well as future ground - based networks like the stellar oscillations network group ( song ) , will soon allow additional tests of dynamo models using other solar - type stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ironically , many of the best targets for asteroseismology are stars in the southern sky , while long - term activity cycle surveys have largely been confined to the north .",
    "in august 2007 , we began a long - term ca hk monitoring program for a sample of 57 southern solar - type stars using the 1.5-m telescope at ctio .",
    "this survey will continue through july 2010 as an noao long - term observing program , supplemented by additional time from our collaborators at smarts institutions . by the end of the long - term program",
    ", we will either directly measure or provide firm lower limits on the cycle period for those stars with the shortest activity cycles . by comparing our observations with those from an earlier single - epoch survey @xcite , we will also establish interesting limits on the cycle period for those stars with the slowest variations in activity .",
    "the single - epoch survey of @xcite contained a total of 1016 observations of 815 individual stars with visual magnitudes between 0.0 and about 9.0 , which were observed using the _ rc spec _ instrument on the ctio 1.5-m telescope .",
    "several sub - samples were defined , including the `` best & brightest '' ( b ) and `` nearby '' ( n ) samples , which together contain 92 individual stars with visual magnitudes between 0.0 and 7.9 , and b@xmath6v colors that are approximately solar .",
    "we further restrict our sample to the 57 stars in the combined ( b+n ) sample that are brighter than v@xmath7 , the limiting magnitude of future ground - based asteroseismic observations by song ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "all of the most promising southern asteroseismic targets ( @xmath0  cen  a  &  b , @xmath1  hyi , @xmath2  ara , @xmath3  cet , 70  oph  a , @xmath4  ind ) are included in this b+n subsample .",
    "the ctio 1.5-m telescope is now operated by a consortium of about a dozen partners , known as smarts ( small and moderate aperture research telescope system ) .",
    "this consortium runs the telescope in queue mode , with observations collected by a trained technician and made available for download by the principal investigator .",
    "the technician cycles between the available instruments based on the demand for each during the semester .",
    "it is important to note that smarts operates the _ only _ southern telescope run in queue mode with an aperture and instrument that are appropriate for this project . aside from a dedicated survey telescope like the one at mount wilson ,",
    "smarts is the only option that makes such time - domain monitoring feasible .",
    "the s - index derived from our first two years of survey data are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] for several stars with interesting variations over this short time baseline .",
    "the southern target hd 17051 ( @xmath8  hor ) exhibits a steady rise from mid-2008 through early 2009 , with the most recent data suggesting a possible reversal from peak activity in mid-2009 .",
    "the active equatorial target hd 22049 ( @xmath9  eri ) shows smooth variations from one season to the next , with a mean activity level comparable to that measured by the mount wilson and lowell surveys .",
    "the moderately southern g0v star hd 165185 appears to have a maximum in activity in early 2009 .",
    "the mean activity level measured by @xcite is shown for each star as an open square near the left axis for reference .",
    "no longer - term trends are apparent for these three targets .",
    "similar plots for all of our survey targets are shown in figures [ fig2 ] & [ fig3 ] .",
    "the sample has been divided into subsets of low- and high - activity stars , each with a common vertical scale . within each subset",
    ", the stars are displayed in three columns ordered by their hd number .",
    "activity levels from the single - epoch survey of @xcite are again shown on the left to reveal longer - term trends , and targets that are included in the mount wilson ( mwo ) and lowell ( sss ) surveys are indicated at the upper right of each panel .",
    "we performed least - squares linear fits to each of the data sets to quantify the significance of any increasing or decreasing trends over the first two years , with the results shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we found significant slopes ( from 4.5 to 126@xmath10 ) for 85% of the targets , while the remaining 15% were statistically flat ( from 1.4 to 3.8@xmath10 ) .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the fraction found to be in a maunder minimum type phase by @xcite .",
    "significant trends are observed for the recent asteroseismic targets @xmath1  hyi ( hd  2151 , 7.3@xmath10 ) , @xmath3  cet ( hd  10700 , 8.4@xmath10 ) , @xmath0  cen  b ( hd  128621 , 116@xmath10 ) , @xmath2  ara ( hd  160691 , 8.8@xmath10 ) , 70  oph  a ( hd  165341 , 64@xmath10 ) , and @xmath4  ind ( hd  211998 , 6.3@xmath10 ) .",
    "no significant trend is yet seen for @xmath0  cen  a ( hd  128620 , 1.7@xmath10 ) .",
    "this survey began with smarts time purchased by high altitude observatory through georgia state university , and is currently supported under noao long - term program 2008b-0039 .",
    "the national center for atmospheric research is a federally funded research and development center sponsored by the u.s .  national science foundation ."
