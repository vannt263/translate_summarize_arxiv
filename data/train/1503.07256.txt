    "in recent years , the importance of thulium - doped fiber lasers ( tdfls ) at 2 @xmath2 m has been kept growing both in research area and laser industry @xcite , since their output power reached 1 kilowatt @xcite , the second place among fiber lasers . comparing to their outstanding counterparts at 1 @xmath2 m , ytterbium - doped fiber lasers ( ydfls ) ,",
    "tdfls operate at a widely tunable wavelength range from 1810 nm to 2200 nm @xcite covering the water absorption peak at 1.94 @xmath2 m and part of atmospheric transmission window , which is favourable for many medicinal and military applications @xcite .",
    "besides , operating at longer wavelengths and the so - called eye - safe waveband will increase the thresholds of nonlinear effects @xcite and the level of the permissible exposure , respectively .",
    "+ however , the development of high - power tdfls is largely hindered by severe thermal effects because the heat load of the tdfls is @xmath4 larger than that of the ydfls @xcite . except some cases making use of the heat generated in fiber , such as suppression of stimulated brillouin scattering @xcite ,",
    "thermal effects are mostly detrimental .",
    "not only those taking effects at very high power outputs , such as thermal lens , melting and rupture of silica @xcite , insufficient cooling of any fiber lasers would lead to decrease of efficiency and output power , increase of lasing threshold , and wavelength redshift @xcite .",
    "besides , it would also result in the damages of fiber lasers by burning of polymer coating or fiber fuse effect @xcite even at hundred - watt level and below .",
    "+ different approaches has been employed to eliminate the heat generated in fiber lasers , including various designs of convective cooling @xcite and gain fiber @xcite , different pump strategies @xcite , and multiple laser configurations @xcite .",
    "for example , the realization of the first kilowatt tdfl was based on the usage of all - glass fibers to avoid the burning of polymer coating @xcite .",
    "however , the endeavours on cooling and laser design can not truly settle this problem , because the heat is primarily originated from quantum defect and non - radiative decay @xcite .",
    "the revolutionary technique that push the outputs of ydfls to 10 kilowatt is tandem - pumping @xcite , which essentially was employed to decrease quantum defect at high powers . + to decrease the quantum defect , pump wavelengths close to lasing wavelengths should be employed . for the tdfls ,",
    "the pump transitions @xmath0 , @xmath5 , and @xmath3 , corresponding to several pump wavelengths , can be used to output 2-@xmath2 m laser @xcite . in this paper , we analyze their lasing performances and thermal characteristics at multi - kilowatt level by employing an experimental - validated model .",
    "based on the numerical results , we propose tandem - pumped tdfls to minimize the heat generation at high powers .",
    "we arrange the paper as follows . in section",
    ", we briefly summarize the characteristics of the different pump transitions . in section",
    ", we establish our theoretical model and validate it by the comparison with experimental results . in section , we demonstrate the numerical results and discuss their implications .",
    "we propose the design of the tandem - pumped tdfls in section and drawn our conclusions in section .",
    "the pump transitions @xmath0 , @xmath5 , and @xmath3 correspond to three absorption wavebands of thulium cations peaked at @xmath10.8 @xmath2 m , @xmath11.2 @xmath2 m , and @xmath11.65 @xmath2 m , respectively @xcite . however , except the absorption peak of @xmath0 coincidentally locates at the wavelengths of high - efficiency laser diodes ( lds ) at @xmath10.8 @xmath2 m , it is difficult to find suitable sources for efficient excitation at the absorption peaks of other pump transitions .",
    "the pump sources emit at these wavelength - peaks are usually of low efficiency and difficult to scale up to high power , such as raman lasers and color center lasers .",
    "fortunately , these absorption wavebands all span over very broad spectral ranges , so various light sources can be employed as the even through the absorption cross sections are small .",
    "the related experiments can be found in @xcite and references therein , we are only interested here in the pump sources with fiber - based structures and having been fully exploited to deliver hundreds - of - watt output powers , because of their potential for realizing monolithic fiber lasers and capacity to provide abundant pump powers through well - developed fiber pump combiners for achieving multi - kilowatt 2-@xmath2 m outputs . +    p2cm|m1.6cmm1.6cmm0.8cmm0.8 cm pump transition & @xmath0 & @xmath5 & + wavelength ( @xmath2 m ) & 0.8 & 1 & 1.6 & 1.9 + @xmath6 ( @xmath7m@xmath8 ) & 8.5 & 1.1 & 1.6 & 0.6 + @xmath9 ( @xmath10m@xmath11 ) & 2.5&1.2&1.1&11.5 + @xmath12 ( % ) & 53.2 & 37 & 72 & 90.2 + pump source & ld & ydfl & eyfl & tdfl +    table provides basic characteristics of different pump transitions at the wavelengths that coincide with available high - power fiber - based pump sources .",
    "eyfl is the abbreviation of erbium / ytterbium - codoped fiber laser .",
    "the parameters of stimulated absorption cross section @xmath6 and fiber attenuation @xmath9 at these wavelengths are taken from @xcite and the corresponding laser slope efficiency @xmath12 are taken from representative experimental works @xcite .",
    "the pump transition @xmath0 at @xmath10.8 @xmath2 m has a very large absorption cross section , which enables its efficiency of absorption when using cladding - pumped low - brightness lds .",
    "for example , commercial available thulium - doped fibers ( tdfs ) usually have a cladding absorption of @xmath13 db / m , so the tdfls can be efficiently operated at a gain fiber length of @xmath15 m. however , strong pump absorption will induce substantial heat generated at the injection end of the gain fiber .",
    "a solution is to use low doping concentrations @xcite but this method will reduce the efficiency of the famous `` two - for - one '' cross relaxation ( cr ) process @xcite and thus affect the @xmath12 of the tdfls .",
    "the emission wavelengths of high - power ydfls lies at the edge of the @xmath5 absorption waveband .",
    "however , the rather small absorption cross sections can be compensated by the high - brightness of fiber lasers as the pump sources .",
    "the disadvantages of this pump transition are its low slope efficiency related to the abundant transition processes , such as excited - state absorption ( esa ) and cr , and a possible photodarken effect @xcite .",
    "although the origin of the photodarken effect has not been clearly understood , it was usually be related to high excitation intensity @xcite .",
    "so this effect may be insignificant in cladding - pumped tdfls at 1 @xmath2 m because of the wake absorption .",
    "for the pump transition @xmath3 , eyfls at @xmath11.6 @xmath2 m and tdfls at @xmath11.9 @xmath2 m can be employed .",
    "high slope efficiencies are usually achieved under this pump transition , because it has a simple `` two - level '' energy diagram similar to that of ydfls and very high quantum efficiency .",
    "especially when using 1.9-@xmath2 m tdfls as the pump sources , a slope efficiency of 90.2% has been acquired @xcite . a quantum defect of less than 10% will be important for the heat management at high - powers , which has be justified in the development of ydfls .",
    "same as that at @xmath11 @xmath2 m , the absorption cross sections at @xmath11.6 @xmath2 m and @xmath11.9 @xmath2 m are relatively small , but it will not be a problem for their high - brightness pump sources .",
    "special attention should be paid to the large fiber attenuation at @xmath11.9 @xmath2 m , which implies a long gain fiber is unfavorable for the lasers operating at these wavelengths .",
    "the simplified energy diagram of tm@xmath14 cations and all involved transitions are demonstrated in fig .  1 , dashed lines was used to separate the processes related to different pump transitions .",

    "are 83% , 40% , and 53% , respectively , taken from representative experimental works @xcite .",
    "the slope efficiency of fiber - laser - pumped tdfls has been stated above . combining all of them , the wall - plug efficiency of the pump fiber lasers at 1060 nm , 1550 nm , and 1900 nm are 15% , 14% , and 24% , respectively .",
    "the high wall - plug efficiency of the lds@xmath113tdfls@xmath113tdfls make it advantageous over other pump strategies and this efficiency is comparable to available commercial tdfls and solid - state counterparts .      as demonstrated in section , changing the geometry of the gain fiber from 25/400 to 40/250 can significantly improve the slope efficiency of the tdfls pumped at 1900 nm .",
    "we further investigate this phenomenon by varying the diameter of the inner cladding to see how the slope efficiency and the optimized gain fiber length change .",

    "the slope efficiency is dropped to 53.7% and the optimized gain fiber length is 33.5 m. such a long fiber will not only increase the propagation loss of the laser and also accumulate nonlinear effects , such as stimulated raman scattering , which are unwanted for power scaling @xcite . on the other hand , with an inner cladding diameter of 60 @xmath2 m",
    ", corresponding to a power filling factor of 0.44 , the slope efficiency is 93.2% close to the quantum efficiency ( 95% ) and the optimal length of the gain fiber is 0.6 m. there parameters are favorable for the operation of multi - kilowatt tdfls . besides , using the high - brightness fiber lasers as the pump avoids the demand of a high na inner cladding , which brings convenient to the design of small inner cladding fibers .",
    "+        to realize the tandem - pumped tdfls we proposed , another obstacle is that the polymer coating of double - clad fiber will absorb the lights at wavelengths longer than 1 @xmath2 m @xcite , which will result in the coating burning when certain amount of long - wavelength pump power is launched .",
    "a straight - forward solution is to replace the polymer with a material which is transparent to the long - wavelength pump .",

    "9 . beyond this method , other types of fibers such as photonic crystal fibers may also be promising for guiding long - wavelength pump lights .",
    "+        we further investigate the thermal performance of the triple - clad fiber .",
    "we employ the fluoride glass to constitute the extra layer for example , which has a thermal conductivity of 0.628 wm@xmath11k@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the core / inner cladding / coating diameter of the double - clad fiber we used is 40/250/400 @xmath2 m . for the triple - clad fiber",
    ", we employ the same geometry to keep the lasing performance unchanged and substitute a part of the coating with the fluoride glass , which has a thickness of 70 @xmath2 m .",
    "figure  10 shows the radial distributions of temperatures for the double- and triple - clad fibers when a tdfl pumped at 1900 nm outputs 1-kw 2-@xmath2 m laser at a @xmath105 of 1000 wm@xmath11k@xmath11 .",
    "due to the fluoride glass has a larger thermal conductivity than the polymer , which leads to a more efficient heat dissipation , the temperature of the triple - clad fiber in the core and inner cladding is 8 @xmath114c lower than that of the double - clad fiber .",
    "so we can conclude that adding a extra layer which has a larger thermal conductivity than the polymer will be favorable for the heat dissipation of fiber .",
    "based on an experimental - validated model , we have numerically analyzed thermal characteristics of multi - kilowatt tdfls using different pump transitions .",
    "our results show the temperature of the gain fiber will be significantly decreased by employing the pump transition @xmath3 and @xmath5 , comparing to the tdfls pumped by high - power lds at 79x nm ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we have thus developed the tandem - pumped tdfls and discussed their feasibility and design .",
    "we have also analyzed the temperature of the gain fiber under different convection cooling conditions and the difference between the laser and superfluorescent operations .",
    "the thermal analysis in this work can be referenced in the design of high - power tdfls and tdfas .",

    "<S> thermal effects are critical constrains for developing high - power thulium - doped fiber lasers ( tdfls ) . in this paper , we numerically investigate the lasing and thermal characteristics of the tdfls under different pump transitions . </S>",
    "<S> our results show , the widely - used pump transition @xmath0 , taking advantages of high - power high - efficiency laser diodes at @xmath10.8 @xmath2 m , may not be a superior choice for directly outputting multi - kilowatt at 2 @xmath2 m because of severe thermal problems . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , using other pump transitions resulting 2-@xmath2 m emissions , especially the in - band pump transition @xmath3 , will decrease the generated heat to a large extent . by optimizing the power filling factor of the gain fiber , </S>",
    "<S> we find a 2-@xmath2 m tdfl cladding - pumped at 1.9 @xmath2 m will lead to the laser slope efficiency close to its quantum efficiency ( 95% ) . </S>",
    "<S> the induced ultra - low quantum defect would be of great importance for power scaling . </S>",
    "<S> we thus propose tandem - pumped tdfls for reducing the heat at high powers and discuss the related issues of design . </S>",
    "<S> besides , we also explore the differences of the thermal characteristics between laser and superfluorescent operations , which will contribute to deepening the understanding of the thermal effects in high - power thulium - doped fiber amplifiers .    </S>",
