    "discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods are known to be flexible and efficient solvers for a wide range of partial differential equations . among their advantages , when applied to second order elliptic problems , we emphasize that they are locally conservative , they can handle general meshes with hanging nodes and they allow the use of different polynomial degrees in each element .",
    "dg methods can be coupled with the boundary element method ( bem ) in different ways @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that it is possible to benefit from the features highlighted above when approximating non - homogeneous ( and even nonlinear @xcite ) exterior elliptic problems if a local discontinuous galerkin method ( ldg ) is used as an interior solver in combination with the bem .",
    "the symmetric ldg - bem formulation is obtained by rewriting locally the elliptic problem in mixed form and considering a caldern identity on the boundary . in this way",
    ", one ends up with a system of two variational equations in the interior domain ( involving both the potential and the flux as independent variables ) and a system of two boundary integral equations relating the cauchy datum of the problem on the coupling interface . in the first ldg - bem formulation @xcite",
    ", the coupling between the two systems is performed by using costable s approach . from the dg point of view , this amounts to using the normal derivative of the solution on the coupling boundary as a neumann datum when defining the numerical fluxes for the ldg method . in the resulting coupled scheme ,",
    "the normal derivative becomes an independent unknown and the other bem variable ( the discrete trace ) must match the discrete potential that comes from the ldg method .",
    "the problem is that these unknowns are of different nature : the restriction of the ldg approximation of the potential to the coupling interface is discontinuous while the bem discretization is conforming and produces a continuous and piecewise polynomial approximation of this variable .",
    "this inconvenience is addressed in @xcite by introducing a further unknown that acts as a lagrange multiplier and enforces weakly the imposition of the missing transmission condition . a later paper",
    "@xcite eliminated the need of the lagrange multiplier by demanding that the discontinuous piecewise polynomial functions that approximate the potential in the ldg method be continuous at the coupling interface . here , the normal derivative is the only boundary unknown , which reduces the number of unknown functions by two with respect to the first version . however , in order to deal properly with this formulation in practice a lagrange multiplier must come again into play . moreover , this formulation imposes for the bem the mesh inherited from the interior partition of the domain , which reduces much of the flexibility provided by the discrete galerkin method near the coupling boundary .",
    "finally , we point out that recently non - symmetric couplings of dg with bem have also been studied , cf .",
    "@xcite and the references therein .    in this paper ,",
    "following @xcite , we take advantage of the fact that the flux variable is an ldg active unknown ( as in the traditional mixed formulation ) and consider a dual approach : we define the numerical fluxes by considering the trace of the solution on the coupling boundary as dirichlet datum .",
    "hence , as opposed to the former strategy , the trace of the solution is an independent variable while the ldg normal flux and the normal derivative must be merged on the coupling boundary .",
    "notice that in this case both variables are ( naturally ) nonconforming and no lagrange multiplier or special restriction is needed to match them .",
    "consequently , the resulting numerical scheme enjoys all the good properties of a typical dg method and allows for using an independent boundary mesh .",
    "moreover , one can employ both a conforming or a nonconforming approximation on the boundary .    in this paper",
    ", we take advantage of the results from @xcite to deal with a dg finite element method on the boundary , the resulting scheme will be referred to as the ldg - fem / dg - bem method . to our knowledge , this is the first fem - bem scheme that combines dg approximations on the boundary and in the interior .",
    "technical difficulties that already arose in @xcite , oblige us to consider conforming and quasi - uniform families of triangulations on the coupling boundary . following the technique from @xcite , this can be relaxed to meshes that are conforming and quasi - uniform on planar sub - surfaces of the coupling interface .",
    "however , for simplicity , the technical details for such an extension are omitted here and we will consider globally conforming and quasi - uniform boundary meshes .",
    "fortunately , restrictions on the boundary mesh have no negative impact on the triangulation of the interior domain since the two meshes are related by a mild local condition , see below .",
    "finally , we analyze the scheme that is obtained by using a conforming rather than non - conforming bem on the interface .",
    "the resulting scheme will be referred to as the ldg - fem / bem method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we present our model problem and recall some basic properties of boundary integral operators . for simplicity of exposition",
    "we will restrict our interest to a three - dimensional problem posed in the whole space . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we derive the ldg - fem / dg - bem scheme and prove that it admits a unique solution .",
    "stability and a priori error estimates are proved in section [ s4 ] . in section [ s5 ]",
    "we show that the same technical arguments provide ( without the quasi - uniformity requirement for the meshes on the coupling boundary ) a convergence result for the ldg - fem / bem scheme .",
