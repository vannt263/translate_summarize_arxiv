    "the good numerical results obtained from the application of exponential methods to the time integration of stiff semilinear problems , have motivated much interest on these kind of methods during the last years , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the problems under consideration can be written in the abstract format @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a linear operator representing the highest order differential terms and @xmath5 is a lower order nonlinear operator .",
    "the solution to the initial value problem is then given by the variation of constants formula and most of the exponential methods considered in the literature are constructed from this representation of the solution .",
    "let us consider for instance the family of multistep exponential methods developed in @xcite and briefly reviewed in section  [ subsec_msm ] . given a stepsize @xmath6 , @xmath7 and approximations @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , the @xmath11-step method approximates the solution @xmath12 of at @xmath13 by @xmath14 where @xmath15",
    ", @xmath16 denotes the standard forward difference operator , and for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 as we can see in , these methods require the evaluation of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , for @xmath22 defined in .",
    "this is in fact the main difficulty in the implementation of the methods in and , in general , of exponential methods , since they typically require the evaluation of vector - valued mappings @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the time step in the discretization and either @xmath25 or @xmath26 with @xmath27 an integer and @xmath28 a polynomial .",
    "the values of @xmath27 and @xmath29 in depend on the method .",
    "for instance , in the case of the methods in , it is clear from that @xmath30 , the number of steps of the method , and @xmath31 for the explicit exponential runge  kutta methods constructed in @xcite it is @xmath32 and @xmath33 as we can see in section  [ subsec_rkm ] , .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a way to evaluate the operators @xmath23 in and when @xmath4 in is the infinitesimal generator of an analytic semigroup in a banach space @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we will assume that @xmath35 is sectorial , i.e. , @xmath4 is a densely defined and closed linear operator on @xmath34 and there exist constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and an angle @xmath38 , such that the resolvent fulfils @xmath39    as a side product we also obtain an accurate way to evaluate the mappings @xmath40 in at the scalar level , which is itself a well - known problem in numerical analysis .",
    "this is exemplified in @xcite with the mapping @xmath41 which is required for instance by the exponential runge  kutta methods of @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath42 for small @xmath43 by using formula suffers from cancellation error . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of a truncated taylor expansion only works well for small enough @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that for some intermediate values of @xmath43 it is not very much clear how to choose the proper formula and moreover both of them could lose accuracy . for @xmath43 inside a sector @xmath44 ,",
    "these difficulties can be overcome by writing @xmath42 in the format , with @xmath32 and @xmath45 . by doing so",
    ", we will be able to evaluate @xmath46 , independently of the size of @xmath43 , by using essentially the same technique developed in principle to evaluate the vector - valued mapping @xmath47 .",
    "in the recent literature , several alternatives have been proposed to evaluate the required operators @xmath23 or alternatively their action on given vector , based on a krylov approach @xcite , on pad approximants @xcite or on a suitable contour integral representation of the mappings by means of the cauchy integral formula @xcite . in particular , in @xcite , the goal is both the evaluation of the mappings @xmath48 at the scalar level , assuming that a diagonalization of @xmath4 is available , but also at the operator level , since it also allows the evaluation of the operators @xmath23 working with the full matrix @xmath4 . however , despite the good computational results reported in @xcite , the way of selecting the parameters involved in the quadrature formulas is not very much clear and they depend very strongly on the equation considered and the spatial discretization parameters .",
    "the algorithm we propose is derived by using laplace transformation formulas and is finally based on a suitable contour integral representation of the mappings @xmath23 , too .",
    "however , the quadrature formulas we use borrow their parameters from the method in @xcite for the numerical inversion of sectorial laplace transform , where a rigorous analysis of the error is performed together with an optimization process to choose the different parameters involved in the approximation .    in order to apply the quadrature formulas developed in @xcite",
    ", we derive a representation of the operators in and as the inverses of suitable laplace transforms @xmath49 at certain values of the original variable @xmath50 .",
    "these laplace transforms have all the form @xmath51 with @xmath52 a scalar rational mapping of @xmath53 . due to",
    ", the mappings @xmath49 turn out to be _ sectorial _ in the variable @xmath54 , i.e. , there exist constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 , possibly different from the constants in , such that @xmath57\\displaystyle      \\| \\phi(z , ha)\\| \\le \\frac { m}{|z - \\gamma|^{\\nu } } , \\qquad\\hbox{for some } \\nu\\ge 1 .    \\end{array}\\ ] ] in this way , we reduce the problem of computing @xmath23 to the inversion of a sectorial laplace transform @xmath49 of the form .",
    "we then use the method for the numerical inversion of sectorial laplace transforms developed in @xcite and reviewed in section  [ sec_lt ] .",
    "the inversion method consists on a quadrature formula to discretize the inversion formula , so that we finally approximate @xmath58 with the quadrature weights @xmath59 and nodes @xmath60 given in .",
    "the convergence results in @xcite assure an error estimate in the approximation at least like @xmath0 .",
    "further , by following this approach , our selection of parameters in the implementation of exponential methods depends only on @xmath61 in , being independent of @xmath24 and @xmath62 . in the particular case",
    "that we want to evaluate @xmath63 at a scalar @xmath43 in the sector @xmath44 , the approximation becomes simply @xmath64 and the convergence rate improves to an @xmath2 .",
    "the approximation in allows the computation of all the operators @xmath23 required by an exponential method before the time - stepping begins , so that only the products matrix@xmath65vector need to be implemented at every time step .",
    "however , formula requires the computation and storage of all the inverses @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "even if @xmath4 is a sparse matrix and these inversions can be performed efficiently , the storage of the resulting full matrices @xmath23 and the subsequent products matrix@xmath65vector can become prohibitive for large problems . in this situation , should be combined with a data sparse procedure to approximate the resolvent operators , as it is proposed in @xcite .",
    "another way to avoid the computation and storage of all the resolvents in could be the application of the formula to evaluate the action @xmath68 on a given vector @xmath69 , instead of the full operator @xmath23 . in this case , it is not necessary the computation of the full inverses @xmath66 , but the resolution of the linear systems @xmath70 however , solving all these linear systems for all the quadrature nodes @xmath60 in at every time step can become quite expensive and , in this sense , the krylov approach developed in @xcite appears as a more competitive alternative .",
    "in this situation , only formula can be useful , in order to evaluate the mappings @xmath48 at the eigenvalues of the hessenberg matrices involved in the krylov approximation .    by using we are in fact computing an approximation to the numerical solution of provided by an exponential method .",
    "thus , the global error after applying to the time integration of can be split into the error in the time integration by the `` pure '' exponential method and the deviation from the numerical solution introduced by the approximation of the operators @xmath23 .",
    "the error in the time integration for the exponential integrators considered in the present paper is analyzed in @xcite and @xcite ( see section  [ sec_expmethods ] ) , and the quadrature error is analyzed in @xcite ( see section  [ sec_lt ] , theorem  [ thm : err ] ) . in order to visualize the effect of this approximation , we show in section  [ sec_experiments ] the performance of our implementation for several problems with known exact solution and moderate size after the spatial discretization . in the error plots provided",
    "we can observe that the error coincides with the expected error for the exact exponential integrators up to high accuracy for quite moderate values of @xmath1 in , i.e. , the error induced by the quadrature is negligible compared to the error in the time integration .",
    "finally we notice that the matrix exponential @xmath71 and also certain rational approximations to it originating from runge ",
    "kutta schemes have already been successfully approximated by using this approach @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_expmethods ] we consider the class of explicit multistep exponential methods proposed in @xcite and the explicit exponential runge  kutta methods in @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec_lt ] is a review of the method for the numerical inversion of sectorial laplace transforms presented in @xcite . in section  [ sec_eval ]",
    "we deduce a representation for the operators required in the implementation of these integrators in terms of suitable laplace transforms and apply the inversion method to the implementation of exponential methods . in section  [ sec_evalscalar ]",
    "we consider with some detail the evaluation of the associated mappings at the scalar level and present some numerical results .",
    "we finally test our algorithm with several examples in section  [ sec_experiments ] , where we implemented by using the full matrices .",
    "in this section we review some of the exponential methods in the recent literature . in this way , we consider the class of explicit multistep exponential integrators developed in @xcite and the exponential runge  kutta methods of @xcite , which are explicit as well .      in @xcite ,",
    "a class of explicit exponential methods is constructed for the time integration of problems of the form with @xmath72 the infinitesimal generator of a @xmath73-semigroup @xmath71 , @xmath74 , of linear and bounded operators in a banach space @xmath34 .    as we already stated in the introduction , we will restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath4 in sectorial .",
