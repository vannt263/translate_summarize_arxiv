    "point masses under the influence of newtonian gravity and point charges under the influence of coulombic attraction experience a 1/_r_@xmath7 force .",
    "particles in this picture will approach one another according to newtonian ( nonrelativistic ) dynamics and if released from rest will reach the force center in a time that is typically shown to be proportional to the initial separation to the three - halves power .",
    "this type of solution appears in various places in textbooks as an application of gravitational forces@xcite , and in electromagnetism textbooks surrounding the classic image problem@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the solution leading to this result is plagued with superluminal ( _ i.e. _ faster than light speed ) transport and hence can not be formally correct .",
    "in addition to relativistic effects , action - at - a - distance type forces require propagation of information about the force .",
    "news of changing particle positions must propagate to the other particle before any changes can be realized and the news travels at a fixed ( finite ) speed , namely , the speed of light .",
    "care must be taken to properly account for these retardation effects .",
    "the ultimate effect is to extend the time it takes for the particle to reach the force center as compared with an assumption of instantaneous updating .",
    "the electromagnetic category of problem is discussed in this paper , but the same formalism can be applied to the gravitational problem as well .",
    "the solution discussed below for problems of this type incorporates einstein s special relativity and includes the effects of field retardation . in section  [ imageproblem ] the classic image problem is discussed and solved taking special relativity into account .",

    "the classic image problem in electromagnetism involves a grounded infinite conducting plane and a point charge .",
    "the force of attraction between the point charge and the plane is identified using an equivalent picture of an image charge equidistant behind the plane of opposite sign .",
    "the field configuration in the half - space of the point charge is mathematically equivalent to the picture where an image charge of equal magnitude and opposite sign resides equidistant behind the plane .",
    "hence , the field configuration of the point charge and the plane is mathematically equivalent to the the field between the point charge and the image charge in the space of interest .",
    "if released from rest , the charge begins to move toward the plane , which also moves the image charge closer to the midpoint between the charge and the image .",
    "consequently , the force of attraction between the charge and the image rapidly increases .",
    "the expectation in the textbooks is that newton s 2nd law can be employed to write a second - order differential equation to be solved for @xmath8(_t _ ) .",
    "typically , one is asked to show that the time to reach the plane is@xcite @xmath9 where _ q _ is the charge , _ m _ is the mass and _ d _ is the initial separation between the point charge and the plane .",

    "consequently , by uniqueness theorem arguments , one knows that the image configuration is mathematically equivalent to the original problem .",
    "as soon as the original charge moves , so too will the image charge ( very much like two gravitating masses approaching one another ; however , the image charge is not a physical charge so it does not introduce kinetic energy into the picture ) .",

    "the discussion of the previous section improves upon the nonrelativistic analysis which is typically used to find the time to reach the plane .",
    "however , it too is lacking in some respects .",
    "when the charge is a distance _ x _ from the plane and moving toward the plane , the force it experiences is different from a static coulomb picture because the",

    "hence , the electric field it experiences must be related to the electric and magnetic potentials at some earlier time ( the so - called retarded time ) .",
    "simply put , it takes a time _",
    "x / c _ for information on the particle dynamics to reach the plane .",
    "the charge configuration on the plane is updated ( which means the image charge location is updated ) and then that information requires a time _ x / c _ to get back to the point charge .",
    "this type of physical circumstance is describable by the linard - wiechart potentials for a moving point charge@xcite .",
    "suppose the charge is located at position _",
    "x _ and moving with a velocity @xmath23_v _ ( again , positive _ x _ to the right ) .",
    "the general problem to calculate the retarded potentials is nontrivial , but when the motion is one - dimensional it simplifies significantly . in particular ,",
    "the electric field experienced by the charge in this case is reduced by two powers of @xmath15 .",
    "it can therefore be written as @xmath33 the force drawing the charge toward the plane is therefore velocity dependent and it is reduced as compared with the static case .",
    "consequently , the relativistic and properly time - delayed equation of motion is @xmath34 remarkably , this too can be integrated to find the velocity as a function of position .",
    "it becomes @xmath35 another integral is required to identify a relationship between position and time in this relativistically consistent and properly casual description of the dynamics .",

    "one must keep in mind that the dimensionless parameter is related to the charge , mass , and initial separation through @xmath37        graphical results indicate that so long as the dimensionless parameter _ d_/(@xmath1_c _ ) is less than roughly 0.1 , then the nonrelativistic expression for the time is completely adequate . for values of the parameter",
    "greater than 1 the relativistic and retardation effects become very important . what remains to be considered",
    "is to identify the physical situations that correspond to each of these regimes .",
    "there is of course some concern about using a solution for @xmath1 that involves superluminal transport .",

    "typical laboratory - type charges are microcoulombs , with typical masses in the milligram - to - gram range , and initial separations in the neighborhood of tens of centimeters .    for the typical configuration described above",
    ", the important parameter comes out to be of the order 10@xmath38 as can be seen from the information in table  [ dptable ] .",
    "consequently , the nonrelativistic solution is completely sufficient for this case .",
    "we emphasize that even though the nonrelativistic expression for the total time to reach the plane is valid , it does not mean the particle was completely nonrelativistic .",
    "rather , the time spent moving relativistically was such a small part of the total time that relativistic corrections are unimportant .",
    "it is especially reassuring to notice that the number 10@xmath38 is several orders of magnitude smaller than the region in fig .",

    "this too is completely legitimately described by nonrelativistic formulae .",
    "the argument that saves the nonrelativistic expression is that even though the last tiny fraction of the trip to the grounded plane is superluminal , the charge spends so little time moving faster than light that the the deviation from the  correct \" time is immeasurably small .",
    "so , once again , the nonrelativistic expression is sufficient .",
    "lastly , we investigate extreme cases where relativistic and retardation effects could be important .",
    "consider an electron released from rest a distance 1 femtometer from a grounded conducting plane .",
    "the important parameter determining the dynamics is again the number _",
    "d_/(@xmath1_c _ ) which comes out to be of the order 1 for this configuration .",
    "the nonrelativistic expression will fail noticeably for this case . not only is relativity important for the dynamics , but field retardation effects are very important .",
    "a proton released 10 fm from the plane results in a parameter _ d_/(@xmath1_c _ ) of 10@xmath41 .    before concluding , it is useful to extend the solution presented above for the electrical charges to the case of two gravitating point masses .",
    "consider two point masses _ m _ initially separated by a distance 2_d_. we have immediately solved that problem as well using a correspondence between charge and mass , and between the inverse of the permittivity of free space and newton s universal gravitational constant .",
    "the above dynamical expressions relating position , velocity and time hold for the case of gravity while the relevant dimensionless parameter becomes @xmath42 where _ g _ is newton s universal gravitational constant . for most configurations",
    "this parameter is extremely small .",
    "hence , once again , the nonrelativistic expression for the time to reach the center of mass is completely safe to use .",
    "the classic image problem of a point charge near a grounded conducting plane invites the notion of a mathematical tool of replacing the grounded plane with a fictitious charge ( a so - called image charge ) which , together with the original charge , produces the same electric potential in the region of interest and respects the boundary conditions .",
    "the existence and uniqueness theorems indicate that the scalar potential and therefore the ( vector ) electric fields must be equivalent .",
    "it is a beautiful solution to an otherwise difficult problem .",
    "the follow - up problem involves computing the time it takes the charge to reach the plane when the charge is released from rest .",
    "a straightforward ( although incorrect ) analysis from nonrelativistic classical mechanics results in an expression for the time which is proportional to the initial separation to the three - halves power , also roportional to the square root of the mass , and inversely proportional to the charge .",
    "we have pointed out in this article the serious formal flaw in that proposed solution .",
    "the flaw is linked to the observation that the velocity of the charged particle exceeds the speed of light for a small portion of its trip toward the grounded plane .",
    "it is very important to sort out when the solution is still valid and acceptable , and when it is noticeably inadequate .",
    "this has been the purpose of our article .",
    "we have shown that the relativistic version of the problem is completely tractable and results in subluminal dynamics which changes the expression for the time to reach the plane by monotonically increasing the result as a function of the dimensionless parameter _ d_/(@xmath1_c _ ) .",
    "a more sophisticated approach to point charge dynamics near a grounded conducting plane must include field - retardation effects .",
    "this has also been added to the solution discussed in this paper .",
    "using time - delayed fields ( linard - wiechart potentials ) increases further the time required for the particle to reach the plane .",
    "both effects , relativistic and retardation influences , are easily understood in terms of their tendency to increase the time for the particle to reach the plane .",
    "finally , we briefly mention other problems where these same effects could be important .",
    "first , a point charge _",
    "q _ of mass _ m _ near a fixed line charge @xmath43 experiences a force that is proportional to 1/_r_. the nonrelativistic time to reach the line charge can be computed as@xcite @xmath1 = @xmath24_d_@xmath44 .",
    "however , the charge goes superluminal as it reaches the line charge .",
    "a point dipole _",
    "p _ of mass _ m _ near a fixed line charge @xmath43 experiences a 1/_r_@xmath4 force . using nonrelativistic dynamics",
    "again we find the time to reach the line charge is @xmath1 = ( @xmath24_d_/4)@xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , a point charge _",
    "q _ of mass _ m _ near a point dipole _",
    "p _ of mass _ m _ will experience an inverse cube force ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the nonrelativistic time for the two to meet at the midpoint ( each of which is initially a distance _ d _ away from the midpoint ) is @xmath1 = @xmath47 .",
    "and lastly , two identical point dipoles _ p _ with mass _ m _ will experience a force proportional to 1/_r_@xmath48 .",
    "the nonrelativistic expression for the time to reach the midpoint is@xcite @xmath1 = ( 2/3)@xmath49_d_@xmath21 @xmath50/@xmath51 , where the constant @xmath49 can be computed as @xmath52\\/d\\theta \\quad = \\quad 1.12\\ldots \\label{sineintegral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in each case above , analytic or numerical expressions for velocity as a function of position and position as a function of time can be identified .",
    "relativistic corrections and field retardation effects are equally readily obtainable . for increasingly steeper",
    "_ r_-dependence , one might expect that the effects could be increasingly more important .",
    "the small - distance behavior determines the relative importance of the effects , and hence the dipole - dipole is the most sensitive to these effects .",
