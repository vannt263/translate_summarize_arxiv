    "in  @xcite , gupta and kumar introduced and studied the throughput scaling in large wireless ad hoc networks .",

    "multi - hop schemes were then further developed and analyzed in the literature  @xcite while their throughput per s - d pair scales far less than @xmath14 .",
    "recent studies  @xcite have shown that we can actually achieve @xmath15 scaling for an arbitrarily small @xmath16 by using a hierarchical cooperation strategy , thereby achieving the best result we can hope for , i.e. , the linear scaling of the total throughput .",
    "besides studies to improve the throughput up to the linear scaling , an important factor that we need to consider in practical wireless networks is the presence of multi - path fading .",
    "the effect of fading on the scaling laws was studied in  @xcite , where it is shown that achievable scaling laws do not change fundamentally if all nodes are assumed to have their own traffic demands ( i.e. , there are @xmath1 s - d pairs )  @xcite or the effect of fading is averaged out  @xcite , while it is found in  @xcite that the presence of fading can reduce the achievable throughput up to @xmath17 . however , fading can be beneficial by utilizing the opportunistic gain provided by the randomness of fading in multi - user environments , e.g. , opportunistic scheduling  @xcite , opportunistic beamforming  @xcite , random beamforming  @xcite in broadcast channels , and an opportunistic two - hop relaying protocol  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "strategies for improving the throughput scaling over non - faded environments were shown .",
    "in  @xcite , it was shown how fading improves the throughput using opportunistic routing  @xcite when a single active s - d pair exists in a wireless ad hoc network .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the benefits of fading by utilizing opportunistic routing in multi - hop transmissions when there are multiple randomly located s - d pairs in the network .",
    "one natural question is how scaling behaves when not all nodes in the network are source nodes . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in improving the number of supportable s - d pairs to maintain a constant throughput per s - d pair by using opportunistic routing .    in most network applications , power and delay",
    "are also key performance measures along with the throughput .",
    "the trade - off among these measures has been examined in the sense of scaling laws in some papers  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we analyze a power  delay trade - off of opportunistic routing and regular multi - hop routing as the number of s - d pairs increases up to the operating maximum .",
    "we first show the existence of a fundamental trade - off between the total transmission power per s - d pair and the average number of hops per s - d pair , i.e. , delay .",
    "it is investigated whether or not power can be reduced at the expense of increased delay for both routing scenarios , but better trade - off can be obtained with opportunistic routing .",
    "the improvement comes from the multi - user diversity ( mud ) gain over the conventional multi - hop routing .",
    "this increases the average received signal power , which in turn makes it possible to have more simultaneous transmissions since more interference is tolerated .",
    "we show this provides up to a logarithmic boost in performance . the advantage of the opportunistic routing over the conventional scheme is also evaluated by computer simulations , which show trends consistent with our theoretical predictions .",
    "in addition , we derive an upper bound on the total throughput scaling using the cut - set bound .",
    "it is shown that the achievable rates of the conventional and opportunistic routing schemes become close to the upper bound when the number of s - d pairs scales between @xmath17 and @xmath18 for an arbitrarily small @xmath16 , which is the operating regimes in our work .",

    "delay trade - off .",
    "the cut - set upper bound on the throughput is presented in section  [ sec : upper ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conc ] summarizes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional wireless network that consists of @xmath1 nodes uniformly and independently distributed on a square of unit area ( i.e. , dense network  @xcite ) .",
    "we assume there are @xmath19 randomly located s - d pairs , where @xmath19 scales slower than @xmath1 .",
    "the received signal @xmath20 at node @xmath21 at a given time instance is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the signal transmitted by node @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the circularly symmetric complex additive - white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with zero mean and variance @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the set of simultaneously transmitting nodes .",
    "the channel gain @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the complex fading process between nodes @xmath24 and @xmath31 , which is assumed to be rayleigh with @xmath32=1 $ ] and independent for different @xmath24 s and @xmath31 s .",
    "moreover , we assume the block fading model , where @xmath30 is constant during one packet transmission and changes to a new independent value for the next transmission . @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the distance between nodes @xmath24 and @xmath31 and the path - loss exponent , respectively .",
    "we assume the channel state information ( csi ) is available at all receivers , but not at the transmitters .",
    "we next introduce the scaling parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the average number of hops per s - d pair is interpreted as the average delay and is denoted as @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 denotes the total average transmit power used by all hops for an s - d pair .",
    "assuming the transmit power is the same for each hop , we see @xmath36 is equal to @xmath35 times the transmit power per hop . since there is no csi at the transmitter , we assume that each source node transmits data to its destination at a fixed rate @xmath14 and at a fixed power @xmath37 . then , the total throughput @xmath38 of the network is given by @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that we scale all the transmit power such that the total interference power from the set @xmath40 is given by @xmath14 ( see section  [ sec : scaling_opp ] for detailed description ) .    throughout this paper",
    "@xmath41 $ ] denotes the expectation .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all logarithms are assumed to be to the base 2 .",
    "in this section , we describe our routing protocols with and without opportunistic routing .",
    "we simply use a multi - hop strategy in both cases using the nodes other than s - d pairs as relays .",
    "hence , we do not assume the use of any sophisticated multi - user detection schemes at the receiver .",
    "scales between @xmath17 and @xmath18 for an arbitrarily small @xmath16 , then multi - hop protocols are enough to satisfy order optimality in dense networks .",
    "this is to be shown in section  [ sec : upper ] . ]",
    "opportunistic routing was originally introduced in  @xcite and further developed under various network scenarios  @xcite .",
    "when a packet is sent by a transmitter node , it may be possible that there are multiple receivers successfully decoding the packet . among relaying nodes that successfully decode the transmitted packet for the current hop ,",
    "the one that is closest to the destination becomes the transmitter for the next hop . since the packet can travel farther at each hop using this opportunistic routing ,",
    "the average number of hops can be reduced .",
    "we slightly modify this routing to apply it to our network .",
    "the per - hop distance of this opportunistic transmission is random .",
    "however , we can make sure there are multiple successfully receiving nodes in a given square cell with high probability ( whp ) if we control the size of the cell and the distance between the transmitter and the cell .",
    "then , one of the successfully receiving nodes can be the transmitter for the next hop .",
    "since each node transmits at a rate of @xmath14 , a packet is decoded successfully if the signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) exceeds a pre - determined threshold @xmath42 independent of @xmath1 .",
    "short signaling messages  @xcite need to be exchanged between some candidate relaying nodes to decide who will be the transmitter for the next hop .",
    "we assume that these messages are transmitted using a different frequency from that for data packets and have a negligible overhead compared to the data packet transmissions .",
    "we divide the whole area into @xmath43 square cells with per - cell area @xmath44 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdlines ] .",
    "note that @xmath45 holds since the average distance between an s - d pair is @xmath14 .",
    "we assume xy routing , i.e. , the route for an s - d pair consists of a horizontal and a vertical paths , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdlines ] ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote a source and the corresponding destination node , respectively , for @xmath48 ) .",
    "nodes operate according to the 25-time division multiple access ( tdma ) scheme .",
    "it means that the total time is divided into 25 time slots and nodes in each cell transmit 1/25-th of the time . ) , 25-tdma scheme is employed to guarantee that there are no transmitter and receiver nodes near the boundary of the two adjacent cells , and to avoid a partitioning problem , which will be discussed later in this section . ] all transmitters in a cell transmit simultaneously .",
    "[ fig:25tdma ] shows an example of simultaneously transmitting cells depicted as shaded cells .",
    "our routing protocol consists of two transmission modes , modes 1 and 2 , where mode 2 is used for the last two hops to the destination and mode 1 is used for all other hops ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sdlines ] for the brief operation of two modes ) .",
    "* mode 1 * : we use an example shown in fig .  [ fig : mud1 ] to describe this mode . transmitting nodes in cell",
    "a transmit packets simultaneously , where one of those can be either source @xmath49 or relay node @xmath50 .",
    "a relay node that is two ( cell b ) or three ( cell c ) cells apart from the transmitter horizontally or vertically is chosen to transmit the packet in the next hop . when choosing the relay for the next hop , for example @xmath51 or @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mud1 ] , one needs to consider nodes in cell b or c that correctly decoded the packet .",
    "if there is none , then an outage occurs , i.e. , we have no node satisfying @xmath53 in the cell .",
    "even if an instantaneous retransmission can be applied until there is no outage for that hop , we do not assume any retransmission scheme in our case since we will make the outage probability negligibly small .",
    "if there are more than one candidate relay , then we choose one among them arbitrarily .",
    "note that the mud gain will be roughly equal to the logarithm of the number of nodes in cells b and c , which will be rigorously analyzed in the next section .",
    "we perform mode 1 until the last two hops to the destination , and then we switch to mode 2 .",
    "the reason we hop two or three cells at a time is because 1 ) hopping to an immediate neighbor cell can create huge interference to a receiver node near the boundary of the two adjacent cells and 2 ) always hopping by two cells is not good since it partitions the cells into two groups , even and odd , and a packet can never be exchanged between the two groups .",
    "* mode 2 * : for the last two hops to the destination , mode 2 is used .",
    "if we use mode 1 for the last hop , we can not get any opportunistic gain since the destination is pre - determined .",
    "hence , we use the following two - step procedure for mode 2 .",
    "we use the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : mud2 ] to explain this mode .    * _ step 1 : _ in this step , a node in cell d or e ( @xmath54 or @xmath55 in fig .  [ fig : mud2 ] ) transmits its packet , whose signal reaches cell f. this is similar to what happens in mode 1 except that we are seeing this from cell f s perspective .",
    "assuming @xmath3 nodes in cell f , we arbitrarily partition cell f into @xmath56 sub - cells of equal size , i.e. , there are roughly @xmath56 nodes in each sub - cell .",
    "one node is opportunistically chosen among nodes that received the packet correctly in each sub - cell . therefore , @xmath56 nodes are chosen in cell f as potential relays for the packet . *",
    "_ step 2 : _ in step 2 , which corresponds to the last hop , the final destination ( @xmath57 or @xmath58 ) in cell g or h sends a probing packet ( short signaling message ) to see which one of the @xmath56 relaying nodes in each sub - cell will be the transmitter for the next hop whose channel link guarantees a successful packet transmission .",
    "finally , the packet from the selected relaying node in cell f is transmitted to the final destination .",
    "although there are only @xmath56 candidate nodes in mode 2 , while it was @xmath3 in mode 1 , this does not affect the scaling law since the mud gain is logarithmic in @xmath3 and since @xmath59 .      in this case ,",
    "a plain multi - hop transmission  @xcite is performed with a pre - determined path for each s - d pair consisting of a source , a destination , and a set of relaying nodes .",
    "therefore , there is no opportunistic gain .",
    "the whole area is also divided into @xmath43 cells with per - cell area @xmath44 , and one source in a cell is arbitrarily chosen while transmitting at a fixed rate @xmath14 .",
    "we assume the shortest path routing and the 9-tdma scheme as in  @xcite .",
    "however , due to fading , a transmission may fail , causing outages . to resolve this problem ,",
    "a retransmission and/or rate / power adaptation can be used . in this paper",
    ", we simply assume there is no time - varying fading for non - opportunistic routing scenario , and thus , there will be no outage if we can control interferences .",
    "this will give an upper bound on the performance .",
    "our goal in this section is to analyze the power ",
    "delay trade - offs with and without opportunistic routing .",
    "if more power is available , then the per - hop distance can be extended . since the path exponent is greater than or equal to 2 , the required power increases at least quadratically in the per - hop distance . on the other hand ,",
    "the total power consumption of multi - hop is linear in the number of hops per s - d pair .",
    "therefore , it seems advantageous to transmit to the nearest neighbor nodes if we want to minimize the total power .",
    "however , this comes at the cost of increased delay due to more hops .",
    "we will show that there is a net improvement in the overall power ",
    "delay tradeoff when our opportunistic routing is utilized in the network .",
    "the relationship among scaling parameters @xmath19 , @xmath36 , and @xmath35 is examined under the opportunistic routing described above .",
    "more specifically , we are interested in how many s - d pairs , denoted by @xmath19 , can be active simultaneously , maintaining a constant rate ( @xmath60 ) per s - d pair when @xmath35 and @xmath36 are given . in the following , we mainly focus on mode 1 since mode 2 can be analyzed similarly .",
    "first let @xmath61 denote the sinr value seen by receiver @xmath31 ( in two cells depicted as cells b and c in fig .",
    "[ fig : mud1 ] ) when a packet is sent by transmitter @xmath24 for the @xmath62-th hop of the @xmath3-th s - d path , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 . here ,",
    "@xmath65 denote the set of hops for the @xmath3-th s - d path , where @xmath66 is a positive parameter that does not scale faster than @xmath14 .",
    "then , we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote the received signal power from the desired transmitter @xmath24 and the total interference power from all other simultaneously transmitting nodes , and are given by @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "here , @xmath72 is the set of simultaneously transmitting nodes . before establishing our trade - off results , we start from the following lemma , which shows lower and upper bounds on the number of nodes in each cell available as potential relays .    [",

    "the proof of this lemma is given in  @xcite . in a similar manner , the number of nodes inside each sub - cell defined in mode 2 is between @xmath77 whp .",
    "we now turn our attention to quantifying the amount of interference in our schemes in the following two lemmas .",
    "[ lem : sdlines ] if @xmath78 and @xmath79 for a sufficiently small @xmath80 , then the maximum number of s - d paths passing through each cell simultaneously is @xmath81 whp .",

    "this tends to one as @xmath98 goes to infinity , i.e. , @xmath99 , for a certain constant @xmath100 .",

    "this is because we assume @xmath158 , which implies that @xmath68 and @xmath69 need to be @xmath159 and @xmath117 , respectively , as mentioned earlier .",
    "then , more hops are needed , i.e. , per - hop distance is reduced , to maintain the interference level @xmath69 at @xmath117 as @xmath19 increases .",
    "hence , from the above argument , we may conclude that the power is reduced at the expense of the increased delay .",
    "furthermore , utilizing the opportunistic routing increases the power compared to the non - opportunistic routing case , but it can reduce the delay significantly .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether our opportunistic routing is beneficial or not from figs .",
    "[ fig : power ] and [ fig : delay ] .",
    "now we plot the power versus the delay , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tradeoff ] , where it is straightforward to get the power  delay trade - off curves from ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) , ( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) , ( [ eq : pnno ] ) , and ( [ eq : dnno ] ) .",
    "then , it can be clearly seen that opportunistic routing ( @xmath155 ) exhibits a much better overall power ",
    "delay trade - off than non - opportunistic scheme ( @xmath156 ) . for example",
    ", if the delay @xmath35 is given by @xmath17 , then the power @xmath36 is reduced by @xmath17 when opportunistic routing is used . in this case , it is further seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : delay ] that the number @xmath19 of supportable s - d pairs is improved by @xmath17 , i.e. , logarithmic boost on the total throughput @xmath38 .",
    "this gain comes from the fact that the received signal power increases for opportunistic routing due to the mud gain , which allows more simultaneous transmissions since more interference can be tolerated .",
    "in this section , we use computer simulations to confirm our analytical results . we slightly modify our system model so that it is suitable for numerical evaluation . to remove any randomness of node location",
    ", we assume a regular network where nodes are equally spaced over the network .",
    "horizontal routing is only needed , assuming a source and its corresponding destination lie on the same horizontal line . under these modifications ,",
    "the 16-tdma scheme is sufficient rather than the 25-tdma .    with the regular network assumption ,",
    "our asymptotic scaling curves are the same as those for random networks since @xmath35 does not scale faster than @xmath18 for an arbitrarily small @xmath16 .",
    "suppose that there are 1024 regularly - spaced nodes in the whole network and the path - loss exponent @xmath106 is given by 4 .",
    "then , we evaluate the average delay ( @xmath35 ) , the power @xmath36 , and the number @xmath19 of active s - d pairs such that both @xmath69 and @xmath68 are kept at 1 on average . when the delay is given by 2 , 4 , and 8 , the corresponding power and the number of active s - d pairs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_results ] .",
    "although these curves look slightly different from our analytical ones , it can be seen that the trends are similar .",
    "to see how closely our achievable rates with and without opportunistic routing approach an information - theoretic upper bound , we consider the cut - set upper bound on the total throughput  @xcite .",
    "[ thm : cutset ] the total throughput @xmath38 in the network with @xmath19 active s - d pairs is upper - bounded by @xmath160 whp .",
    "the proof essentially follows the steps similar to those of  @xcite .",
    "we basically use the single - input multiple - output ( simo ) cut by separating a source node from the rest of the network .",
    "then , the throughput per s - d pair is upper - bounded by @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is some constant independent of @xmath1 . hence ,",
    "for @xmath19 s - d pairs , we get @xmath163 .",
    "note that the upper bound in theorem [ thm : cutset ] assumes the full cooperation among all receiver nodes .",
    "the upper bound matches the achievable throughput scaling in  @xcite for @xmath164 within a factor of @xmath1 with a vanishingly small exponent .",
    "however , it is seen that the achievable rate @xmath148 of our routing protocols is also close to the upper bound up to @xmath165 as long as @xmath19 is between @xmath17 and @xmath18 for an arbitrarily small @xmath16 .",
    "the scaling behavior of ad hoc networks using opportunistic routing protocol has been analyzed .",
    "specifically , it was shown how the power and delay scale as the number of randomly located s - d pairs increases .",
    "we proved that the opportunistic routing exhibits a much better power  delay trade - off than that of the conventional scheme employing non - opportunistic routing , while providing up to a @xmath165 boost in the scaling law due to the mud gain .",
    "the trade - offs with and without opportunistic routing were also verified by numerical evaluation .",
    "finally , the cut - set upper bound on the total throughput was derived , and it was shown that the achievable rates of the conventional and opportunistic routing schemes are close to the upper bound when the number of active s - d pairs is between @xmath17 and @xmath18 for an arbitrarily small @xmath16 .",
    "there are @xmath166 interfering cells in the @xmath167-th layer of 25-tdma ( see fig . [ fig:25tdma ] ) .",
    "let @xmath168 denote the total interference power at a fixed receiver node from simultaneously transmitting nodes in the @xmath167-th layer , where @xmath169 for some constant @xmath170 independent of @xmath1 .",

    "by lemma [ lem : sdlines ] , the maximum number of simultaneous transmitters in each cell is given by @xmath81 .",
