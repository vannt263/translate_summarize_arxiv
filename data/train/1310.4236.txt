    "the galactic center ( gc ) region is unique because of its extreme environments , such as high - temperature gas , a high density of stars and clouds , and strong magnetic fields .",
    "one of its characteristic features is the strong  k@xmath11 and  k@xmath11 emission , which indicates the presence of an extremely high temperature ( @xmath37  kev ) plasma .",
    "the plasma emission is unresolved and smoothly distributed over the gc region .",
    "although the origin of the plasma , whether it is truly diffuse plasma or a superposition of faint point sources , is still under debate , past nuclear starburst activity is one of the possible origins based on what has found in other starburst galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    at the dynamical center of our galaxy , the supermassive black hole sagittarius ( sgr ) a * ,",
    "whose mass is estimated to be @xmath3@xmath12 @xcite . however , unlike an extragalactic active nucleus , the x - ray luminosity of sgra * is only @xmath3@xmath13  erg  s@xmath14 , which is @xmath15 times lower than the eddington luminosity . on the other hand , several observations suggest that sgra * was active in the past . for example",
    ", the strong and time - variable k@xmath11 emissions from dense molecular clouds are interpreted as reflection and fluorescence due to strong x - rays from past sgra * flares @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that sgra * was continuously active 100500  yr ago and suddenly became quiescent in the last 100  yr .",
    "recent gev gamma - ray observations revealed a giant bubble structure ( the so - called `` _ fermi _ bubbles '' ) , which extends up to @xmath16 above and below the gc with a width of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this outstanding bipolar emission could have be formed by a past jet from sgra * or nuclear starburst activity .",
    "such outflow - like emissions were also reported at other wavelengths : the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe haze @xcite , the north polar spur @xcite , and the gc radio lobe @xcite .",
    "if such energetic outflows were generated by past sgra * activity , then another relic might remain in the vicinity .",
    "rosat _ all sky survey has detected a smaller extended ( plume - like ) x - ray emission 1.5 south of sgra * ( wang 2002 ) .",
    "although the physical properties of the plume - like emission have not been investigated yet , it may be related to past activity of the gc region .",

    "the shape and position are the same as those of the plume - like emission detected by _ rosat _",
    "hereafter , we refer to this excess as `` gc south '' .",
    "x - ray sources in the gc region are affected by the strong galactic bg , whose x - ray flux depends on position with various components .",
    "thus , careful evaluation of the bg emission is essential . @xcite",
    "extensively studied this emission with _ suzaku _ , and determined the spatial distribution along the galactic latitude and longitude . on the based of the spatial distribution",
    ", they divided the bg emission into two components : the galactic center x - ray emission ( gcxe ) and the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) .",
    "@xcite reported that the gcxe is elliptical with a size of @xmath24 while the grxe is at least one order of magnitude larger scale .",
    "therefore , gc south is located in the region where contributions from the grxe are dominant .",
    "we extracted x - ray spectra from the four reference regions shown in figure [ fig : gcimage ] ( ref14 ) .",
    "they show many emission lines of various elements that are typical of the grxe .",
    "we therefore constructed a bg model based on the grxe model reported by @xcite .",
    "the model includes a high temperature plasma component ( hp ) , a low temperature plasma component ( lp ) , and a foreground emission component ( fe ) , all of which are modeled by collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) plasmas .",
    "although the fe consists of 0.59  kev and 0.09  kev plasmas in the study of @xcite , we applied a single @xmath30.59  kev plasma because the contribution of the 0.09  kev plasma is negligible in the energy range used in our analysis ( 0.710 kev ) .",
    "free parameters include the temperatures ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) and the emission measures ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) .",
    "the metal abundances relative to solar values @xcite were common between the hp and lp .",
    "those of mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe were free parameters while the ne and ni abundances were linked to mg and fe , respectively .",
    "the other elements were fixed to the solar values .",
    "for the fe , the metal abundances of ne and mg were free parameters while those of the other elemetns were linked and allowed to vary . in order to reproduce the k@xmath11 emission in the spectra",
    ", we also added a gaussian component with a fixed line centroid of 6.4 kev . the continuum emission associated with",
    "the k@xmath11 emission was included in the hp .",
    "in addition , we need to include the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) even though its contribution is small . the cxb was represented by a single power - law function with a photon index and surface brightness ( 210  kev ) of 1.41 and @xmath31  erg  @xmath32  s@xmath14  sr@xmath14 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of our bg model is therefore @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( column density of @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 ( column density of @xmath37 ) represent the interstellar absorptions toward the gc and for the fe component , respectively .",
    "the absorption for the cxb is twice that of @xmath35 , because the cxb is of extragalactic origin behind the gc region .",
    "we simultaneously fitted the reference - region spectra with this model . since the flux in the term ( hp + lp + gaussian ) depends on the position as shown in @xcite , we multiplied by a constant factor as @xmath38 where @xmath39 for ref1 was fixed to 1 , and those for the other regions were free parameters .",
    "the @xmath35 values were also independently allowed to vary while the other parameters were common among the regions . as a result of our fitting ,",
    "the spectra were well reconstructed with @xmath40 .",
    "the best - fit models and parameters are shown in figure [ fig : bgdspec ] and table [ tab : bgdfit ] , respectively .",
    "we note that the hp , lp and fe parameters are slightly different from those of @xcite .",
    "this is due to the difference of the models and selected regions ; the grxe spectrum of @xcite is a composite from the on - plane regions of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , while our bg regions are far from the plane of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "one might claim that the abundances of some elements are significantly smaller than the solar values .",
    "we approximated the bg spectra using simplified plasma models based on the grxe model near the gc @xcite . in the galactic bulge regions ( our observation fields ) however , the possible contribution of unresolved faint point sources ( e.g. @xcite ) , cxb fluctuation @xcite , or unknown non thermal emissions may not be ignored .",
    "these sources increase the continuum flux in the bg spectrum , and hence reduce the apparent abundances . in order to verify this possibility , we fitted the spectra by fixing the abundances of all the elements in the relevant plasma models ( lp , hp , and fe ) to the solar values , and adding two power - law components ; one is convolved with @xmath45 , and the other is convolved with @xmath46 .",
    "then we obtained a reasonable fit ( @xmath47 ) with no significant change for all the parameters in table [ tab : bgdfit ] .",
    "the best - fit @xmath39 values decrease with increasing the galactic latitude ( @xmath48 ) with an exponential - folding scale of @xmath49 , which is roughly consistent with those of @xcite",

    "we compared these data with the near - infrared extinction ( @xmath51 ) of the stars located in the gc ( ) . the mean @xmath51 and best - fit @xmath35 in the region of @xmath52 are 0.76  mag and @xmath53  @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "thus , a conversion factor @xmath54 was estimated to be @xmath55  @xmath32  mag@xmath14 , which is within the range reported in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with this conversion factor ,",
    "the @xmath51 profile is superimposed on figure [ fig : absorption ] as the blue shaded area .",

    "we found that the @xmath51 in the source region is smaller than that in the reference region by a factor of @xmath30.55 in the @xmath52 range . assuming the same @xmath48-dependence as in the reference regions , we estimated @xmath35 in the source region by normalizing equation ( [ eq : nh ] ) by a factor of 0.55 .",

    "the parameters for the fe were the same as those in the reference regions .",
    "the bg model with these parameters reproduced the 510 kev band spectrum very well , but it left a large data excess in the 0.75.0 kev band .",

    "we then attempted a fitting with a model of combining cie plasma and the bg model .",

    "claimed that the line intensity ratio of 3s@xmath792p ( @xmath30.7  kev ) over 3d@xmath792p ( @xmath30.8  kev ) for has an uncertainty . @xcite and reported that the spex plasma code underestimates the flux around 9.610.6   ( 1.171.29 kev ) , since some fe l - shell transitions ( @xmath80 for , @xmath81 for , and @xmath82 for ) are missing .",
    "we thus phenomenologically added gaussians at 0.8  kev and 1.2  kev .",
    "the fwhm of the 1.2  kev line was fixed to 120  ev to approximate multiple lines .",
    "then , the fit was improved with @xmath83 , but large residuals still remained ( figure [ fig : mergedspec](c ) ) .",
    "we conclude that the cie model for gc south plasma is invalid .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mergedspec](c ) , the data excess at 2.0  kev corresponds to k@xmath11 .",
    "this indicates that the cie model ( @xmath77  kev ) underestimates the ionization state of si .",
    "in addition , we can clearly observe hump - like features around 2.53.0  kev and 3.23.8  kev .",
    "these features are most likely due to the radiative recombination continua ( rrcs ) of si and s , which are observed in some galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although the residual of k@xmath11 can be solved by a multi - temperature cie model , the rrcs can not be reproduced .",
    "the rrc residuals strongly indicate that the plasma is in the recombining phase .",
    "we thus applied a non - equilibrium ionization model ( neij in spex ) , that successfully reproduces the rrc features observed in the snrs w44 and g346.6@xmath220.2 @xcite .",

    "this best - fit model well reproduced the rrc features around 2.53.0  kev and 3.23.8  kev , as shown in figure [ fig : mergedspec](d ) .    for comparison , we list the average charge state of each element in the best - fit neij model and that of the cie at the same electron temperature ( table [ tab : charge ] ) .",
    "we confirmed that gc south is really an rp .",
    "we found that the recombining process dominates in the plasma based on the entire source spectrum .",
    "in order to study the spatial variation of the absorption column density and the ionization state , we divided the source region into three ( src1 , 2 , and 3 ) , as shown in figure [ fig : gcimage ] , and simultaneously fitted their spectra with the neij ( rp ) model .",
    "for the bg model , the parameters of @xmath39 were treated as free parameters in the same way as the entire spectrum fitting .",

    "in fact , we can not find a non - thermal radio shell near gc south ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "multiple sne and stellar winds could provide sufficient energy ( @xmath141  erg ) for the formation of the gc south like galactic super bubbles .",
    "however , neither the ob association nor the region has been detected in this region .",
    "thus , a single or a multiple sn origin is unlikely",
    ".    one possible origin of gc south could be past starburst activity .",
    "for example , the starburst galaxy m82 has a blob called the `` cap '' at the termination point of the superwind from the host galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the size and thermal energy of the cap are @xmath142  kpc and @xmath3@xmath143  erg , respectively . both are larger than those of gc south by two to four orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , gc south might have been formed by small super - wind activity in our galaxy .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite claimed that the star formation rate @xmath144 yr ago in the gc region was higher than the current rate by one order of magnitude ( @xmath30.1  @xmath135  yr@xmath14 ) . assuming a simple initial mass function @xcite , 100 sne of massive stars ( @xmath1458  @xmath135 ) are possible within @xmath3@xmath146 yr . this number of snrs is sufficient to provide the thermal energy of gc south . if the plasma was formed in the gc and blown - out at the sound speed ( 510  km  s@xmath14 for 1.6 kev plasma ) , then @xmath147  yr is required to reach 1.7 ( 230  pc ) south of the gc .",
    "this time scale is consistent with the plasma age , and hence is consistent with the starburst origin .",
    "another possibility is that gc south was created by sgr a * activity @xmath146 yr ago .",
    "such activity may be conceivable , because similar activity @xmath3300  yr and @xmath3@xmath148  yr ago has been suggested by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the flare probably emitted a bipolar flow perpendicular to the galactic plane , and generated a shock - heated hot plasma .",
    "if the speed of the bipolar flow is a few hundred km  s@xmath14 , then the shocked plasma would be formed 230 pc away from sgr a * with a sub - kev temperature , as is observed for the values of gc south .",
    "we discovered that gc south is an rp , which is not predicted in the standard evolution of a shock - heated plasma ; a shock - heated low - density ( @xmath31  @xmath8 ) plasma is in an ionizing phase for a long period because the timescale of electron heating ( @xmath3100  yr ) is much shorter than that of collisional ionization ( @xmath3@xmath149  yr ) .",
    "therefore , to realize an rp , some specific events should occur : either a rapid decrease in the electron temperature or enhancement of ionization only .    in snrs ,",
    "two mechanisms for the decrease of the electron temperature have been proposed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations support these mechanisms ( e.g. , @xcite ) . we attempt to apply these scenarios to gc south .",
    "one is thermal conduction via interactions with ambient cold molecular clouds .",
    "however , no such molecular cloud has been found in this region .",
    "moreover , no spatial gradient of the electron temperature is found in gc south as described in section [ sec : resolve ] .",
    "therefore , this scenario is unlikely .",
    "the other scenario is an adiabatic expansion of the plasma .",
    "the cie plasma would have been formed in the dense circumstellar medium at the starburst site .",
    "if the plasma was blown out rapidly to a thin circumstellar space , then the electron temperature would be rapidly cooled down as a result of the adiabatic expansion . in order to decrease the electron temperature from 1.6 kev to 0.46 kev , the plasma volume should increase by a factor of six , following the @xmath150 relation under the adiabatic condition ( @xmath151 for a monatomic gas ) .",
    "assuming that the size of the plasma increases from 54  pc to 97  pc ( a factor of @xmath152 ) at a sound speed of 510  km  s@xmath14 , the expansion time scale is calculated to be @xmath3@xmath153  yr , which is smaller than the observed recombination time scale of @xmath139  yr .",
    "therefore , the adiabatic expansion is one possible scenario .",
    "selective ionization also formes an rp .",
    "one possibile scenario is photoionization . in this scenario ,",
    "a plasma is irradiated by a strong x - ray source and is over - ionized initialy .",
    "after the termination of photoionization , the plasma enters a recombining phase .",
    "the balance between photoionization and recombination is described by a single parameter , @xmath154 , where @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 are the luminosity of the source , the gas density , and the distance between the irradiating source and the plasma gas , respectively . in order to achieve nearly the same ionization state as the 1.6  kev plasma",
    ", @xmath158 should be @xmath31000 ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , the required luminosity is estimated as @xmath159 here , we assumed the distance from sgra*. if a past flare of sgra * was nearly at the eddington luminosity ( @xmath3@xmath160  erg  s@xmath14 ) , then it could have produced the observed rp .",
    "however , the flare should not be isotropic radiation , because the gcdx , which is in the vicinity of sgra * , is not an rp but a cie plasma ( @xcite ) . therefore",
    ", gc south must be illuminated by collimated radiation . in section [ sec :",
    "origin ] , we discussed a bipolar flow as the possible origin of gc south .",
    "if this outflow also exhibited collimated x - ray radiation similar to blazar activity , then the plasma would become an rp .",
    "indeed , the luminosity of blazars can reach as high as @xmath3@xmath161  erg  s@xmath14 .",
    "the _ fermi _ bubbles suggest that a past outflow from sgra * occurred @xmath148  yr ago @xcite .",
    "although the epoch of the @xmath162 bubbles activity is significantly older than the time scale of gc south , the possibility of similar activity @xmath146  yr ago may can not be excluded .",
    "we observed the region 1.01.8 south of the gc with _",
    "suzaku _ and discovered an rp , which is not predicted by the standard shock - heated plasma evolution .",
    "the plasma is most likely to be located in the gc region from its absorption column density .",
    "its size was then estimated to be 97  pc @xmath6 37  pc , and its thermal energy reaches @xmath136  erg .",
    "this plasma is unique in both its rp and its large thermal energy .",
    "we consider that the origin of the plasma is putative past activity in the gc region .",
    "one possibility is small superwind due to a past starburst ; a large plasma was blown out from the gc , and adiabatic expansion of the plasma formed the rp .",
    "another scenario is an outflow from sgra * ; a plasma was formed by shock heating , and then photoionized by collimated x - rays .",
