    ") , evidence for an additional emission component has emerged .",
    "this enigmatic emission is centered at the galactic center and extends @xmath27 away in all directions , falling rapidly ( @xmath28 ) with projected distance from the galactic center .",
    "it is not likely to be an artifact of the foreground subtraction , because south of the gc it is similar in brightness to the other components , and the fit is sufficiently rigid ( only eight parameters for the whole sky to fit 5 bands @xmath29 pixels ) that it is robust to errors in the templates .",
    "even north of the gc , the excess is approximately symmetrical about the gc in spite of much brighter foreground objects such as the large ( @xmath30 ) nearby nebula of @xmath31oph .",
    "this emission component has been nicknamed `` the haze '' to avoid giving it an interpretive name prematurely ( see finkbeiner 2004 ) .    the haze was first thought to be a free - free component from gas too hot to have recombination line emission ( @xmath32 ) and too cold to have significant x - ray emission in the rosat ( snowden _ et al . _",

    "the x - ray emission would be soft enough that gas absorption could block it , but gas is thermally unstable at @xmath36 k because of efficient metal - line cooling ( e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) , and the amount of gas required is inconsistent with hii  column densities determined from pulsar dispersion measures given by taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , the free - free spectrum of @xmath36 k hii  extends up to @xmath37 and the integrated spectral power suggests a substantial free - free power output of @xmath38 .",
    "it is necessary to consider alternative sources of emission .",
    "in this section , the model parameters are specified : annihilation cross section , mass , @xmath1 energy distribution , magnetic field strength , photon field available for ics , and dark matter mass profile in the milky way .",
    "the parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "if the neutralinos present today are the cosmological relic of thermal production in the early universe , then the mean neutralino mass density as a fraction of the critical density , @xmath39 can be computed from its mass and cross section .",
    "the _ wmap_cosmology ( spergel _ et al . _",
    "2003 ) gives @xmath40 , where the subscripts `` dm '' , `` m '' and `` b '' denote `` dark matter '' , `` total matter '' and `` baryon '' , respectively , and @xmath41 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath42 .",
    "the neutralino number density falls rapidly when the temperature of the universe ( @xmath43 ) falls much below the particle mass ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "after this , neutralino annihilations cause the number density , @xmath45 , to drop rapidly [ @xmath46 to the level where the particle annihilation rate ( @xmath47 ) is comparable to the expansion rate , @xmath48 , after which the comoving density asymptotes to the `` freeze - out '' density . in the early , radiation - dominated , universe , @xmath49 ,",
    "so the criterion is = _ avn ~_avn_0 a^-3 ~h ~a^-2 where @xmath50 is the co - moving number density . because temperature @xmath51 , n_0 t_f ~ where @xmath52 is the freeze - out temperature , proportional to the particle mass .",
    "this leads to the remarkable conclusion that the co - moving relic mass density , @xmath53 , is inversely proportional to the cross section , so if one knows the relic mass density today ( or assumes it ) the cross section is fixed .",
    "a more complete calculation ( jungman _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) yields the same relation in terms of @xmath54 : _",
    "h^2 = a proper calculation of the relic density takes account of the form of the density drop after freeze - out and introduces a weak mass dependence in the relic density , but the approximation given in eq .",
    "( [ eq_relic ] ) is adequate for our purposes , and we adopt @xmath55 .      we take the neutralino mass , @xmath44 to be @xmath6 , approximately at the weak scale , and lower than the bounds of @xmath56 given by ellis _ et al . _",
    "( 2000 ) , or @xmath57 several tev ( baltz & gondolow 2004 ) .",
    "this choice of mass is arbitrary , and is degenerate with the fraction of power going into energetic @xmath1 given in  [ sec_result ] .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty in both the injection energy distribution and the effects of diffusion on the resultant number density per energy , @xmath58 .",
    "one possible assumption is that annihilating neutralinos go directly to quark anti - quark pairs which then go to pions : @xmath59 the pions then decay : @xmath60 @xmath61 followed by @xmath62 @xmath63    this results in an injection energy distribution that goes as @xmath64 in the low energy limit ( see blasi _ et al . _",
    "2003 ) , with a significant fraction of the energy carried away by neutrinos",
    ". however , if annihilation to @xmath65 leptons is important ( @xmath66 ) the resulting @xmath1 spectrum would be harder ( hooper _ et al . _",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the injection spectrum must then be evolved through the diffusion and energy loss equations to determine the steady state electron density .",
    "the model in  [ sec_model ] assumes spherical symmetry , but one might also consider cylindrical symmetry with boundaries a few kpc from the galactic midplane at which the electrons escape . if the electrons have time to diffuse to the boundaries before losing most of their energy , the electron spectrum can be considerably hardened . in the limit of rapid escape ,",
    "the steady state spectrum is just the injection spectrum , so that sets a limit on the spectral hardness .",
    "the starlight photon energy density in the inner galaxy is necessary to compute electron energy loss due to inverse compton scattering .",
    "et al . _  ( 2000 ) have considered a model based on _ iras _  and dirbe infra - red data in addition to the usual stellar information , and find that the starlight energy density is approximately @xmath67 in the galactic plane , or about @xmath68 at @xmath69 .",
    "this compares to the energy density of @xmath68 for a @xmath70 g magnetic field , and @xmath71 for the cmb .",
    "the far ir emission is subdominant , but should be included in future models",
    ".      heiles ( 1996 ) presents measurements of different moments of the galactic magnetic field in the plane at galacto - centric distances of 4 and 8.5 kpc .",
    "none of these measurements is exactly the quantity we need , @xmath72 , but they are consistent with @xmath70 g at the solar circle and increasing exponentially toward the galactic center . to demonstrate that our result is not strongly field dependent , we try two cases : @xmath70 g , and @xmath73 g .",
    "this field is similar to the field radial dependence derived by han ( priv .",
    "comm . ) with a scale length of @xmath74 .",
    "because the @xmath75 field and starlight are so close to equipartition , we assume that they are exactly in equipartition for simplicity , even though there is no obvious mechanism to regulate this . also , the field is assumed to be tangled in an isotropic way , so that the particles move in a random walk .",
    "a more detailed model would incorporate what is known about field strength variation with position in the galaxy , especially the fact that the field is stronger in the spiral arms than in inter - arm regions .",
    "synchrotron emission is enhanced perpendicular to the field lines and suppressed along them ; we assume isotropic tangling of the field and therefore isotropic emission .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the tangled to ordered strength , and the mean direction of the ordered part may be important .",
    "for example , han ( 2004 ) suggests that the bulge is dominated by a solenoidal component perpendicular to the galactic plane , which may facilitate rapid escape of electrons from the galactic center , whereas particles created in the arms may be trapped there for longer periods of time .",
    "therefore we should be cautious about applying conclusions drawn from local cosmic ray propagation to particles in the inner galaxy .",
    "this is a rich subject , and is well beyond the scope of this article .",
    "we assume a truncated navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 ; nfw ) profile . because we are only interested in the inner @xmath76 of the galaxy ,",
    "the larger scale shape of the nfw profile is unimportant to this calculation , other than that it serves to tie the assumed milky way mass ( within 400 kpc ) of @xmath77 to a mass density at the center .",
    "we assume an nfw profile with @xmath78 kpc , and arbitrarily truncate the core at 600 pc .",
    "although recent computer simulations indicate that nfw is not valid at the core @xcite , there is theoretical support from the jeans equation for an index of -1 or steeper in the core ( hansen 2004 ) . in the case of a moore ( 1998 )",
    "profile ( @xmath79 ) the annihilation power can be a factor of 5 times higher .",
    "the details of the central truncation are unimportant for nfw profile ( where each concentric shell contributes equal annihilation power ) but becomes important for the moore profile .",
    "at energies of tens of gev , electrons moving in @xmath80gauss fields take millions of years to lose half their energy , so it is a poor approximation to neglect electron diffusion .",
    "we assume that electrons resulting from the annihilation are created at a rate proportional to @xmath11 number density squared and then diffuse in a random walk through the ( rather tangled ) galactic magnetic field .",
    "the number density @xmath81 between energy @xmath82 and @xmath83 evolves according to n(e , * x * ) = ( k(e,*x*)n ) + + q(e,*x * ) where @xmath84 is the diffusion coefficient ( area per time ) , @xmath85 is the energy loss coefficient ( energy loss per time ) , and @xmath86 is the source term ( number density per time ) . neglecting the position dependence of @xmath21 and @xmath87 ,",
    "the steady state equation is : -k(e ) ^2 n -= q(e,*x * ) . in the simple case where @xmath21 is energy independent and @xmath88 with @xmath23 constant ,",
    "the solution for a mono - energetic delta - function source at the origin , @xmath89 , and zero density at @xmath90 , is simply a superposition of spherically symmetric gaussians losing energy and expanding with @xmath91 .",
    "the number density of electrons produced between @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the past is n(e(t),r ) de / dt = q_0(-r^2/2(t)^2 ) with @xmath94 the creation rate ( number per second ) , and where electrons created with energy @xmath95 at @xmath96 lose energy as b(t)==-ae^2 so that e=. in general , the energy loss rate of each electron is b=_tc^2 ^ 2(u_b+u_ph ) where @xmath97 is the thomson cross section , @xmath98 is the speed of the electron , @xmath99 is the electron energy , @xmath100 is the magnetic field energy density and @xmath101 is the photon energy density . in the ultra - relativistic limit , a= , where @xmath102 . for electrons created time @xmath92 ago ,",
    "^2=2kt= so that the number density as an explicit function of energy is : n(e , r ) = q_0 ^3/2 ( ) and the integral along the line of sight is n(e , r ) = ( ) where @xmath103 is the projected galacto - centric distance .",
    "this green function solution must be convolved with the projected source density to obtain the solution for arbitrary @xmath104 , but just this simple expression provides some intuition .",
    "( see appendix a for more details ) .",
    "the energy distribution of the entire @xmath105 population is @xmath106 , as one would obtain for a population created at energy @xmath95 and confined to a box .",
    "however , along any line of sight , the distribution is flatter ( @xmath107 ) because of diffusion .",
    "the older electrons that have lost much of their energy have also had time to diffuse away from the source , leaving a flatter spectrum below some cut - off energy and a sharp drop above it .",
    "this cut - off energy decreases with distance from the source .",
    "another feature of the above solution is that the total projected radial density @xmath108 diverges in the absence of a lower energy bound .",
    "this makes sense , because electrons have been created at rate @xmath94 forever and never disappear . in reality , the diffusion zone in the galaxy has finite size , and most electrons escape while still relativistic .",
    "the effects of this escape will be seen in the numerical solutions in the next section .      for less restrictive assumptions about @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and @xmath104 , analytic solutions to eq ( [ eq_pde ] ) are cumbersome or non - existent , and the pde",
    "must be solved numerically .",
    "being interested in the inner galaxy , where dark matter density is assumed to be highest , we assume spherical symmetry and use the fact that the laplacian of a radial function can be written @xmath109 it is convenient to solve for @xmath110 on a radius - energy @xmath111 grid and divide the result by @xmath112 . in most cases a grid with 30 logarithmic energy bins @xmath113 and 60 radial bins @xmath114 works well .",
    "boundary conditions for @xmath115 are taken to be zero at @xmath116 ( as required ) and @xmath117 and an nfw profile squared as the input source distribution at maximum energy .",

    "this is in general a multi - dimensional space providing exactly enough freedom to fit the boundary conditions stated above .",

    "[ eq_a ] ) .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath129 given here is proportional to but somewhat higher than that found in the study of cosmic ray propagation in the galaxy , including diffusion and convection , by webber , lee , & gupta ( 1992 ) .",

    "tests of milky way satellite dwarf galaxies have also been suggested ( baltz & wai 2004 ) but the signal from these may be too weak for current technology .    while the dark matter annihilation interpretation is exciting , it must be emphasized that other explanations are possible .",
    "a hard electron energy spectrum could be produced by novel physics around the supermassive black hole at the galactic center .",
    "although observations of other galaxies have not revealed such a flat spectrum of emission , they may have lacked the necessary resolution to separate the various emission components .",
