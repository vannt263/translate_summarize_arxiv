    "<S> ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices offer a unique possibility to experimentally explore strongly correlated states of quantum matter . </S>",
    "<S> currently , one of the main experimental challenges in this field is the preparation of a heisenberg antiferromagnet ( afm ) , which represents the necessary next experimental step towards a true quantum simulator of the fermionic hubbard model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although the creation of a fermionic mott insulator ( mi ) has recently been reported  @xcite , the realization of antiferromagnetic order requires temperature and entropy significantly lower than presently achieved  @xcite , despite many existing proposals for direct cooling within the lattice  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative to the direct generation is to use an adiabatic protocol  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a scheme , it is desirable to tune interactions initially to give a ground state with very low entropy . </S>",
    "<S> then , they are changed slowly , until the heisenberg hamiltonian is realized at the end . if the process is adiabatic </S>",
    "<S> , the entropy will stay low and the final state will be the desired afm . </S>",
    "<S> the following questions immediately arise : what are the conditions to achieve adiabaticity ? what occurs </S>",
    "<S> if these conditions are too restrictive and can not be met ? and , how will the protocol be affected by a finite temperature and the presence of a harmonic trap ?    in this letter , we propose a specific adiabatic scheme and analyze these issues . </S>",
    "<S> our adiabatic protocol is the first to attain an afm with ultracold fermions within feasible timescales , even in the presence of experimental imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we show that it is possible to realize antiferromagnetic order on a part of the sample in a shorter time than required for the whole system . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we simulate the dynamics of holes to demonstrate their destructive effect on the afm and devise a strategy to control them .    </S>",
    "<S> the initial ground state of our protocol is a band insulator ( bi ) , which is transformed first to an array of decoupled singlets and finally to the afm , by adiabatically changing the depth of two superimposed optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> a bi is easier to prepare with low entropy than a mi for two reasons . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> its energy gap is given by the band gap , which is much larger than the interaction energy ( mi gap ) and favors a redistribution of the entropy towards the surrounding metallic shell  @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the preparation can be done using weakly or noninteracting atoms , thereby avoiding the long timescales associated with mass and entropy transport at higher interactions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for the one - dimensional case , we simulate the fermionic model with matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we first identify the adiabatic conditions that allow the preparation of the antiferromagnetic state in an ideal case with no defects . </S>",
    "<S> second , we study how these conditions are relaxed if one imposes that antiferromagnetic order is only obtained on a subset of fermions around the center of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that , when restricted to a middle sublattice , adiabaticity is determined by an effective gap related to this sublattice and not by the gap of the total system . </S>",
    "<S> third , we include the presence of holes in the initial state , expected to occur in real experiments due to the finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the large initial energy of the holes can in principle destroy the afm as they delocalize inside the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , if the holes are initially located at the outer part of the sample , as expected in an experiment , a tradeoff can be reached between the degree of adiabaticity of the process and the distance the holes travel inside the chain , so that the antiferromagnetic order is still produced in the center . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that a harmonic trap can prevent the destructive effect of holes by confining them to the outside of the sample . finally , via projected entangled pair states ( peps )  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we complement our analysis with a simulation of the two - dimensional model of hardcore bosons with antiferromagnetic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this setting is easier to investigate numerically than the corresponding 2d fermionic system and provides evidence that the physics studied in the one - dimensional case can be extrapolated to understand the conditions of an equivalent scheme in 2d .    in the following , unless stated otherwise , we will focus on the one - dimensional case and consider a two component fermi gas in an optical lattice . the physical setting </S>",
    "<S> consists of two adiabatic stages , depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we fix the couplings on the even links , and @xmath4 , and choose a linear ramping of the superexchange interaction on the odd links , over total ramping time @xmath5 so that and , for  @xcite . in the following , we set . </S>",

    "<S> . a closer look at the relevant energy levels reveals that in this adiabatic transition the gap decreases monotonically from @xmath10 to the heisenberg gap , which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , and there is no phase transition occurring in between  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the adiabaticity of the evolution and the final antiferromagnetic order can be probed by two experimentally accessible observables . </S>",
    "<S> the first one , the squared staggered magnetization , , is the antiferromagnetic order parameter and can be determined by noise correlations  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> whereas the squared staggered magnetization is experimentally detected over the whole sample and captures information on long - range correlations , the singlet fraction can be determined _ in situ _ and hence allows us to probe parts of the sample . for the heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain in the thermodynamic limit , these observables take on the values @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xcite , </S>",
