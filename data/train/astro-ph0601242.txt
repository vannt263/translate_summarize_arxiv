    "in addition to establishing a secular variation in dm over this time interval , they also show that the underlying density power spectrum has an index of 3.874@xmath130.011 , which is close to what we would expect if the density fluctuations are described by kolmogorov spectrum .",

    "this is given in figure [ fig : struct ] .",

    ", a cautionary remark is warranted .",
    "given the finite time span of our data set , and the fact that the low spatial frequencies dominate the long term variations in dm , we do not have a stationary sample of noise spectrum .",
    "we have estimated the error in each bin of the structure function as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the root mean square deviation with respect to the mean phase structure function value in a bin , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the number of `` independent '' samples in the bin .",
    "this is estimated as the smaller of @xmath33 and the actual number of samples that have gone into the estimation of @xmath31 . here",
    ", @xmath34 is the time span of the data .    by assuming that the transverse speed of the sightline across the effective scattering screen is @xmath440 km sec@xmath2 ( half of pulsar s velocity in its lsr )",
    ", we can translate the delay range between which this slope is valid , to 0.2 to 50 a.u .",
    "the time delay value corresponding to the phase structure function value of unity is , by definition , the coherent diffractive time scale ( @xmath35 ) at the corresponding radio frequency , with the assumption that the scattering material is uniformly distributed along the los . from the fit parameters given in equation  [ eq : fitpars ] ,",
    "this delay is 180 seconds .",
    "this should be compared with the measured @xmath35 value of 444@xmath3628 seconds tabulated in table 3 . if we interpret the inner scale cutoff value of @xmath37 meters as the scale size below which the slope ( @xmath24 ) of the density fluctuation spectrum changes to a value greater than that given in equation [ eq : fitpars ] , then the fact that the measured @xmath35 value of 444 seconds being significantly greater than 180 seconds is understandable . in the limiting case , where the slope of the density irregularity power spectrum changes to the critical value of @xmath38 below the inner scale cutoff value , the expected @xmath35 value is about 1100 seconds .",
    "this makes it very important to measure the exact frequency dependence of the diffractive parameters like temporal scatter broadening and diffractive scintillation time scale .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , cordes et al .",
    "( 1990 ) show the most complete multi - frequency measurements of the diffractive scintillation parameters of this pulsars .",
    "their measurements are not accurate enough to distinguish between such small variations in slope .",
    "while our analysis of dm variability suggests a kolmogorov spectrum at au scales , we are struck by the long term monotonic decrease of dm and wonder if we might be seeing the effects of smooth gradients in large scale galactic structures that are not part of a turbulent cascade .",
    "we performed a monte carlo simulation to investigate this . in each realization of the simulation",
    ", we generated with a different random number seed , a screen of density fluctuations .",
    "we assumed that the random fluctuations corresponding to a given spatial frequency are described by a gaussian function , but the total power as a function of spatial frequencies is described by a single power law of index 11/3 . assuming that the screen is located at the mid point along the sight line",
    ", we let the pulsar drift with its transverse velocity , and measured the implied column density ( dm ) as a function of time .    we developed a procedure similar to that of deshpande ( 2000 ) to compare the observed @xmath39 curve with the simulated ones .",
    "from the observed @xmath39 curve , we computed the parameter @xmath40 $ ] , where @xmath41 is the time delay .",
    "our aim is to compare the distribution of this parameter in very short delays and very large delays .",
    "as we can see in figure [ fig : struct ] , the structure function describes a well defined slope between the delay range of @xmath430 days to @xmath42000 days .",
    "we defined two delay bins , 3060 and 13002000 days , within which we monitored the distribution function of the quantity @xmath42 . from this",
    ", we could infer that the distribution at the bin of 13002000 days had a span of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the rms deviation of the distribution at the delay range of 3060 days .",
    "that is , the @xmath42 values that we see at largest delays is as high as 20 times that of the typical deviations at short delays .",
    "we performed the same procedure on the simulated set of data to quantify the likelihood of such deviations .",
    "we simulated 1024 number phase screens .",
    "out of these 1024 screens , we found that such large deviations were possible @xmath47% of the times .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , as with such a steep spectrum , it is obvious that most of the power is in large scales ( smaller spatial frequencies ) , and hence they tend to dominate our @xmath42 measurements .",
    "we conclude that while monotonic changes of this magnitude are rare , it is consistent with a turbulent cascade spectrum of density fluctutations .",
    "dispersion depends on the column density of electrons . in a uniform medium radio wave propagation",
    "senses the average density in a tube whose beam waist is set by the fresnel radius @xmath45 . in a turbulent medium",
    "frequency - dependent multipath propagation can expand this tube considerably .",
    "with refraction , the center of the tube wanders from the geometric los .",
    "indeed there may be a number of wave propagation tubes , each with their independent relative gain .",
    "the consequence is that dm and related effects will show frequency dependence :    1 .",
    "the effective dm depends on frequency .",
    "2 .   the dm variations at lower frequencies will be much `` smoother '' than that at higher frequencies , as the apparent angular size of the source acts as a _ smoothing function _ on the measured dm variations .",
    "3 .   since the apparent size of the source is larger at low frequencies , some features of the ism that are visible at lower frequencies may be invisible at higher frequencies !",
    "we can explore these effects by assuming that the timing residuals at 327 mhz and 610 mhz , which are relative to the timing model derived at higher frequencies that included removal of dm variations , are due to dm variations .",
    "the smoothing effect of scattering could be revealed by a spectral analysis .",
    "the slow variations were removed to pre - whiten the spectrum that would otherwise be severely contaminated .",
    "the 327 mhz data was fit to a fourth order polynomial and the result was subtracted from both data sets .",
    "the two right side panels give the residual dm values after subtracting the best fit curve from the actual dm curve .",
    "the resulting spectral comparison fails to have sufficient signal to clearly demonstrate increased smoothing at 327 mhz relative to 610 mhz .",
    "higher signal - to - noise ratio is required .",
    "the dm variations relative to long term trends in the right - hand panels of figure [ fig : dmindiv ] are different .",
    "an important source of systematic error that can affect our analysis here is the effect of scattering on the derived dm as a function of time at a given frequency . at 327 mhz , as we described in  [ sec - anal ] , we perform an elaborate procedure to fit for the scatter broadening of the pulse profile , in order to compute the `` true '' toa of the profile .",
    "however , we do not follow this procedure at 610 mhz ( or any other higher frequency ) .",
    "the error due to this can be quantified easily from figure [ fig : tausc ] .",
    "the temporal scatter broadening value varies by an rms value of some 19.6 @xmath5s . with the wavelength dependence of @xmath46 ,",
    "the expected rms variation at 610 mhz is 1.3 @xmath5s .",
    "the equivalent dm perturbation at 610 mhz with respect to infinite frequency is @xmath47  pc  @xmath10 .",
    "in this section , we will estimate quantitatively errors introduced by various scintillation related effects . for psr b1937 + 21 , although a typical observation with highly sensitive telescopes like arecibo telescope helps us achieve a toa accuracy of a few tens of nanoseconds , the ultimate long term accuracy seems to be far greater than this .",
    "in general , it is a combination of frequency independent  intrinsic timing nose \" from the pulsar itself , and the frequency dependent effects , such as what we are addressing here . with some 18 years of data at 800 , 1400 and 2200",
    "mhz , lommen ( 2002 ) quantifies the timing timing residual , after fitting for position , proper motion , rotation frequency and its time derivative ( see also kaspi et al .",
    "a large fraction of the left over residuals is presumably the intrinsic timing noise .",
    "as we have mentioned before , we have absorbed a good part of this by fitting for the second time derivative of the rotation frequency , @xmath48 ( see table  2 ) . in this section ,",
    "our aim is to quantify possible timing errors from various `` chromatic '' effects related to interstellar scintillation .",
    "the temporal variability of pulse broadening , @xmath49 , ( as shown in figure [ fig : tausc ] ) means that even the apparent angular broadening of the source , @xmath50 , is also changing as a function of time . since @xmath51 , with the rms variation in @xmath49 of 19.6 @xmath5s at the radio frequency of 327 mhz ,",
    "the corresponding variation in @xmath50 comes out to be @xmath48% of the mean value .",
    "this change occurs with typical time scales of @xmath467 days , which is the time scale with which @xmath49 changes .",
    "since we have only one epoch of @xmath50 measurement , we have no way of observationally verifying the mean value or the time scale of its variation .",
    "due to non - diffractive scintillation that `` steers '' the direction of rays ( `` refractive focussing '' ) , the position of the pulsar is expected to change as a function of time .",
    "this is an important and significant effect , as it introduces a toa residual as a function of time , depending on the instantaneous position of source on the sky .",
    "several authors have investigated this effect in the past ( cordes et al .",
    "1986 ; romani et al . 1986 ; rickett & coles 1988 ; fey & mutel 93 ; lazio & fey 2001 ) . for a kolmogorov spectrum of irregularities ( @xmath52 ) with infinitismally small inner scale cutoff , cordes et al .",
    "( 1986 ) predict the value of rms image wandering as @xmath53 for an assumed distance to psr b1937 + 21 of 3.6 kpc , this comes to 2 mas at 327 mhz ( wavelength , @xmath54 cm ) .",
    "the value of 2 mas is still significantly less than the apparent angular size of the source , 14.6 mas , measured by gwinn et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . however , for a spectrum with a steeper slope or with a significantly larger inner scale cutoff ( as in our case ) , the value of @xmath55 is expected to be much larger , perhaps comparable to the value of @xmath50 .    in order to estimate the timing errors introduced by this image wandering",
    ", we need an estimate of scattering measure ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 along the los to this pulsar . following cordes et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , @xmath58 here , @xmath49 is specified in seconds .",
    "@xmath56 is specified in units of kpc m@xmath59 . assuming a distance of 3.6 kpc , @xmath49 = 120 @xmath60s , @xmath61=0.327 ghz",
    ", the value of @xmath56 comes to @xmath62 kpc m@xmath59 . assuming that the scattering material is uniformly distributed along the los , @xmath63 m@xmath59 .",
    "then , for a kolmogorov spectrum , the rms timing residual due to the image wandering can be written as ( cordes et al .",
    "1986 ) @xmath64 with the computed value of @xmath57 and a distance of 3.6 kpc , this amounts to 4.8 @xmath5s at 327 mhz .",
    "given the frequency dependence , this effect can be minimized by timing the pulsar at higher frequencies .",
    "for instance , at frequencies of 1 ghz and 2.2 ghz , this error translates to 125 and 2 nanosec , respectively .",
    "however , given the significantly large value of the inner scale cutoff , the rms timing error that we have computed may well be a lower limit , and it is likely to be higher .",
    "given the fact that the exact source position due to this effect is unknown at any given time , it is very difficult to compensate for this effect .",
    "as we saw above , due to image wandering , the apparent position of the source wanders in the sky .",
    "this introduces yet another timing error .",
    "while translating the toa at the observatory to the solar system barycenter , we assume a position which is away from the actual apparent position at the time of observation .",
    "this introduces an error , which can be quantified as ( foster & cordes 1990 ) @xmath65 here , @xmath66 is the velocity of light , the dot product term gives the projected extra path length travelled by the ray due to earth s annual cycle around the sun , and @xmath67 is the positional error due to image wandering . of course , this term is a function of frequency , and hence the error accumulated is different at different frequencies .    at 327 mhz , with an rms image wandering angle of 2 mas , for an object at the ecliptic plane , @xmath68 @xmath5s . for psr b1937 + 21",
    ", this error amounts to @xmath40.8 @xmath5s . at frequencies 1 ghz and 2.2 ghz , this error translates to 85 and 17 nanosec , respectively .",
    "an important issue that arises due to the frequency dependent dm variation is the timing accuracy .",
    "pulsars like psr b1937 + 21 are known for the accuracy to which one can compute the pulse toa . given this ,",
    "one wishes to eliminate any error that is incurred due to systematic effects like what we have here .",
    "between 327 and 610 mhz ( the two curves in figure [ fig : dmindiv ] ) , the typical relative fluctuation of dm that we see is about @xmath69 pc @xmath10 . as we discussed before , this is purely due to the fact that the effective interstellar column length sampled at one frequency is different from that at another frequency , due to the scatter broadening of the source . at 610 mhz , this relative dm fluctuation corresponds to some 6 @xmath5s at 610 mhz .",
    "that is , at 610 mhz , typically an unaccounted residual of 6 @xmath5s is incurred due to just effective dm errors .",
    "even if the behavior of the pulse emission is extremely stable , at low frequencies , interstellar scattering limits our timing capabilities .    due to the fact that dispersion delay goes as @xmath70 ,",
    "although the above mentioned effect seems significant , one should be able to reduce it by going to higher frequencies .",
    "for instance , at 2.2 ghz , the dm - limited toa error for psr b1937 + 21 will be @xmath40.5@xmath5s .",
    "this is not necessarily encouraging news , as a timing residual error of 0.5@xmath5s is large when compared to the accuracy that we can achieve in quantifying the toas ( a few tens of ns ) for this pulsar , given our observations with sensitive telescopes like arecibo .    to summarize , although one takes into account time dependent dm changes while analysing the data , in order to achieve high accuracy timing , it is important to correct for a frequency dependent dm term .",
    "this introduces another dimension of correction in the timing analysis .",
    "we have presented in this paper a summary of over twenty years of timing of psr b1937 + 21 .",
    "these observations have been done over frequencies ranging from 327 mhz to 2.2 ghz with three different telescopes .",
    "given the agreement between the measured apparent angular broadening and that estimated by the temporal broadening , and the measured proper motion velocity and that estimated by the knowledge of scintillation parameters , we conclude that the scattering material is uniformly distributed along the sightline .      1 .",
    "the measured flux variation time scale is about an order of magnitude shorter than what is expected from the knowledge of the observed apparent angular broadening .",
    "the flux variation time scale is observed to be directly proportional to the wavelength , whereas it is expected to vary as proportional to @xmath71 ( for a kolmogorov spectrum ) .",
    "the flux modulation index is observed to have a wavelength dependence that is much  shallower \" than the expected value .",
    "these three discrepancies consistently imply that the optics is `` caustic - dominated '' .",
    "this would mean that the density irregularity spectrum has a large inner scale cutoff , @xmath72 m. our extrapolation of the phase structure function from the regime sampled by dm variations to the diffractive regime seems to indicate that the expected @xmath35 value is considerably shorter than the measured value .",
    "this is in favor of the above conclusion .",
    "accurate measurements of frequency dependence of diffractive parameters is much needed .    in general ,",
    "millisecond pulsars are known for their timing stability .",
    "potentially , we may achieve adequate accuracy in timing some of these pulsars to understand some of the most important questions related to the gravitational background radiation , or the internal structure of these neutron stars .",
    "however , our analysis here shows that interstellar scattering could be an important and significant source of timing error .",
    "as we have shown , although psr b1937 + 21 is known to produce short term toa errors as low as 1020 nanosec with sensitive observations , the long term error is far larger than this . after fitting for @xmath48 ( which absorbes most of the achromatic timing noise ) ,",
    "the best accuracy that we can achieve for this pulsar is @xmath73sec at 1.4 ghz , and about 0.5 @xmath5sec at 2.2 ghz ( by one of the authors , andrea lommen ) .",
    "it appears that almost all of this error can be accounted for by various effects that we have discussed in  [ sec - timingerror ] . in general , for millisecond pulsars with substantial dm , even if achromatic timing noise is small , interstellar medium may be a major source of timing noise .",
    "we thank m. kramer for sharing the data from the effelsberg - berkeley pulsar processor ( ebpp ) , and s. chatterjee and w. brisken for sharing their vlba based proper motion and parallax results of psr b1937 + 21 prior to the publication .",
