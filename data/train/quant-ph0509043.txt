    "a simple quantum computer consists of an array of qubits and a series of gates formed by single - qubit and two - qubit unitary transformations .",
    "a single qubit gate rotates the state of the qubit .",
    "the two - qubit gate creates an entangled pair of qubits . any proposed system for quantum computation must provide a mechanism for pairwise entanglement of qubits .",
    "the possibility of performing quantum computation in ballistic electron waveguides was first proposed by ioniciou et al @xcite . in their approach , a single electron wavepacket and two parallel waveguides",
    "are used to form a  flying qubit , \" with one waveguide designated as the @xmath0 state and the other as the @xmath1 state .",
    "subsequent work by akguc et.al @xcite and snyder and reichl @xcite focused on the computation of _ stationary states of networks _",
    "( rather than use time evolution of wavepackets ) of such qubits .",
    "they showed that it is possible to obtain stationary state solutions to the schrdinger equation for fairly complex quantum networks of qubits and quqits .",
    "one proposed mechanism for entanglement of waveguide based qubits is the coulomb interaction between electrons in different qubits .",
    "for example , a small segment of the waveguides in two qubits ( which we call qubit a and qubit b ) which represent the @xmath1 state could be brought close to one another , or could be separated by a dielectric that allows interaction between electrons in the @xmath1 waveguides .",
    "this must be done in such a manner that electrons can not tunnel between the qubits ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . if electrons in the @xmath1 waveguides pass the interaction region at the same time they can interact and create a phase change in the network state @xmath2 with no change in the remaining states @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this is sufficient to entangle the network . in akguc",
    "et.al @xcite a simple static model of this entanglement mechanism showed that a phase change of @xmath6 could be achieved for the state @xmath2 .",
    "in subsequent sections , we analyse a dynamic model of the electron scattering process in the interaction region which confirms this prediction .",
    "we also analyse a simple two - qubit network which could allow a test for the efficiency of this entanglement mechanism .",
    "the waveguide structures we consider can be formed at the interface of a gaas / algaas semiconductor heterostructure . at temperatures , @xmath7 k , an electron travels ballistically with a phase coherence length of the order , @xmath8 m @xcite .",
    "the gate structures themselves have been shown to be anywhere from @xmath9 m to @xmath10 m in length @xcite .",
    "the small network presented here contains few enough gates to be realizable with the coherence length presently achievable in semiconductor heterostructures .    in sect .",
    "ii , we will present an electron waveguide network consisting of two qubits and a series of single - qubit and two - qubit gates which can be used to test for entanglement .",
    "we first construct the network with ideal single - qubit transformations and ideal entangling two - qubit transformations .",
    "we also construct the network with non - ideal entanglement gates and compare the outputs to the idealized case .",
    "we will see that the output of the non - ideal network could be used to determine whether or not the entanglement gates behave as expected . then in sect .",
    "iii , we present a simple model of an electron scattering process that can achieve entanglement of a pair of qubits . a classical description of the dynamics is first discussed and then a steady state quantum scattering analysis of the same model is used to describe the behavior of the mutual phase acquired by the entangled electron current in the pair of waveguides . in sect .",
    "iv , we make some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we describe a simple quantum network that can test the effectiveness of an entanglement gate .",
    "the network is shown in fig .",
    "it consists of a sequence of single qubit @xmath11 gates , @xmath12 , and two - qubit entanglement gates , @xmath13 .",
    "( in akguc et al @xcite , it was shown that a single qubit @xmath11 could be constructed in electron waveguides by using a properly constructed cavity which connects the two waveguide leads of the qubit . )",
    "electrons are injected into the network from the left in a state @xmath14 .",
    "this state is then acted on by a sequence of gates    @xmath15    where @xmath16    @xmath17    and    @xmath18    all three matrices act on the state vector @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes transpose .",
    "we write the two - qubit entanglement matrix in terms of phases @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 so we can describe some general features of this matrix .",
    "when @xmath24 acts on the input state @xmath25 , we obtain an output state @xmath26 that gives the distribution of electrons exiting the quantum network on the right .",
    "for example , if @xmath27 and @xmath28 , an input state @xmath29 on the left leads to an output state @xmath30 on the right . in this example",
    "a series of single qubit operations and two entanglement operations produces an unentangled output state .",
    "although the output state is unentangled , the particular form of the output state will depend upon a successful entanglement of the qubits in the middle of the computation .",
    "we can indirectly test if the gate @xmath31 is successful in entangling the two qubits by means of the network outlined above .",
    "a specific realization of the gate @xmath13 is defined by the choice of the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . through these parameters",
    "we define two types of the gate @xmath13 , one which entangles the qubits and one which does not . as the parameters",
    "are varied the output of the network is found for both types of @xmath13 gate .",
    "we find that the entangling gate and the non - entangling gate give very different output in both the two qubit and one qubit bases , allowing for the determination of successful entangling operations in the network through the measurement of the output of only one of the qubits .",
    "a perfect entanglement gate @xmath31 changes the phase only of the two - qubit state @xmath2 and is represented by @xmath13 where @xmath27 and @xmath35 . a two - qubit gate that does not entangle the qubits changes the phase of the single qubit states @xmath36 and @xmath37 so that the two qubits remain separable .",
    "such a gate is represented by the matrix @xmath13 where @xmath38 . due to the spatial symmetry of the quantum network we can choose @xmath39 to represent a non - entangling two - qubit gate .",
    "therefore , if we begin with an input state , @xmath40 and act on it with a network , @xmath41 , containing the perfect entangling gate @xmath31 , where @xmath28 and @xmath42 , we find as above , @xmath43 .",
    "a network containing the non - entangling gate where @xmath44 and @xmath28 gives @xmath45 , which is easily distinguishable from the case when entanglement is present . in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the probability , @xmath46 , of finding the ideal output @xmath47 , and equal when no phase change occurs",
    ".    we can find the amount of probability exiting an individual waveguide in a given network by @xmath48 the probability of finding electrons in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states of qubit a for both the entangled network and the unentangled network is plotted in fig .",
    "we see that the amount of probability exiting the @xmath1 waveguide in relation to the @xmath0 waveguide of qubit a is much greater for the entangled network than the unentangled network for phases angles near @xmath49 .",
    "there is a significant range of phase angles when the two networks would be distinguishable .    in the situation",
    "above we have used the spatial symmetry of the network to set @xmath39 for a non - entangling gate @xmath13 . an imperfect non - entangling gate need not split the phase angle @xmath34 equally between the two individual qubits .",
    "we then write @xmath50 and , given an input state @xmath29 , we analyze the output of the network as both @xmath34 and @xmath32 are varied .",
    "we find that when @xmath28 the output states of the entangling network and the non - entangling network are distinguishable for all values of @xmath32 .",
    "as above , the networks are most distinguishable when @xmath51 .",
    "for the entangling network , the probability of finding the output state @xmath52 when @xmath28 is @xmath53 .",
    "for the non - entangling network , the probability of finding the output state @xmath52 when @xmath28 is never larger than @xmath54 for all values of @xmath32 .",
    "in akguc et.al @xcite , we presented a static model of coulomb coupling between electrons in separate leads of a waveguide quantum network .",
    "we considered two parallel waveguide leads belonging to separate qubits , corresponding for example to the @xmath55 states in the two qubits .",
    "we introduced a dielectric window between the leads that allowed electrons in the two leads to interact via their coulomb interaction if they pass the dielectric window at the same time .",
    "we assumed that each electron produces a repulsive potential barrier in the path of the electron in the opposite lead .",
    "we then found that for certain energies the electrons they could resonantly pass the barrier and create a phase shift of @xmath56 for each electron state giving an overall phase shift of @xmath57 for the network state @xmath58 . in this and the next sections , we revisit that picture but with a dynamic model of the actual scattering process .    in order to obtain an exactly soluble model of the scattering process , we simplify the model slightly . in the waveguide network ,",
    "the actual scattering process takes place in the fixed ( in space ) dielectric window if two electrons ( in different waveguides ) pass that window at the same time .",
    "the interaction they feel will be that of a finite range repulsive pulse ( due to their mutual coulomb interaction ) whose shape , width and strength is determined the shape and width of the dielectric window and the distance between the waveguide leads . in our dynamic model we will neglect the dependence on the repulsive interaction due to the finite transverse width of the waveguide leads and we will allow the electrons to interact when they come within the range of their mutual repulsive interaction",
    ". we will choose our initial conditions so that this interaction occurs in a certain interval of space .",
    "below we first consider a classical version of the model and then we consider the fully quantum scattering process .",
    "let us consider two one - dimensional straight wires , infinitely long in the x - direction , and separated by a distance , @xmath59 in the y - direction .",
    "electron a travels in the upper wire and electron b travels in the lower wire .",
    "both electrons travel in the positive x - direction in their respective wires .",
    "we assume that the two electrons have nearly the same kinetic energy .",
    "their velocities differ only by a small amount so that @xmath60 and @xmath61 . initially the separation of the two particles in the x - direction is large enough that no appreciable interaction takes place .",
    "we assume that electron a is initially to the left of electron b but is closing the gap between them as they move up the x - axis .",
    "we can write the total hamiltonian for the system in the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) are the momentum and position of particle a ( particle b ) , @xmath67 is the maximum interaction strength , @xmath68 is the width of the interaction potential between the two electrons and @xmath69 is the total energy of the system . in a coulomb - like interaction",
    "the distance between the wires , @xmath59 , determines the maximum interaction strength , @xmath67 , between the particles but otherwise does not add to an understanding of the interaction itself .",
    "the center of mass momentum and position of the electrons are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "their relative momentum and position are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . in terms of these coordinates ,",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath74 we see that the center of mass momentum and the center of mass energy @xmath75 are constants of the motion .",
    "all the interesting dynamics occurs in the relative motion of the two electrons whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the energy contained in the relative motion of the particles .",
    "the character of this motion is determined by the relationship between the energy of relative motion , @xmath78 , and the interaction strength , @xmath67 . the phase space diagram for the relative motion",
    "is plotted in fig 5 .",
    "electrons with relative energy @xmath79 interchange their momenta during the collision but not their relative postions ( the phase space motion corresponds to the curves that cross the x - axis in fig . 5 ) . trajectories with relative energy @xmath80 interchange their position and not their relative momenta during the collision ( the curves that cross the p - axis in fig . 5 ) .",
    "the case where electrons a and b have approximately the same velocity so @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath81 , and both travel in the positive x - direction corresponds to the case @xmath79 .",
    "electron a will catch up to electron b and they will undergo a collision with the result that they interchange their velocities but not their positions .",
    "we combine the solutions for the center of mass coordinate and the relative coordinate for the case @xmath82 and obtain @xmath83\\ ] ] and @xmath84\\ ] ] for these solutions , the interaction is centered at @xmath85 at time t=0 . in the asymptotic regions where both particles are far away from the interaction ( @xmath86 ) the particles move with constant velocity .",
    "the particles exchange velocity during the interaction and do not pass each other .    in ballistic electron waveguides built using gaas - algaas heterostructures the energy of the traveling electrons at low temperatures is very close to the fermi energy of the electron gas @xcite .",
    "we would therefore expect that the energies of any two electrons traveling through a coulomb coupler - like structure would be quite similar , resulting in a small relative energy with respect to the interaction potential .",
    "this corresponds classically to the case @xmath82 considered above .",
    "let us now consider the quantum realization of the classical model described above .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the two particle system is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the energy eigenstate of the two particle system .",
    "if we again change to center of mass and relative coordinates , the schrdinger equation takes the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 is now a function of the center of mass and relative coordinates .",
    "the center of mass momentum and energy are again constants of motion for this system .",
    "we assume a separable form for the two - particle wavefunction , @xmath91 .",
    "the solution for the the center of mass wave function is @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the center of mass wavevector .",
    "the solution for the wavefunction describing the relative motion is @xcite , @xmath94\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is a hypergeometric function , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "the center of mass solution , @xmath99 , is chosen to represent the state of two particles traveling in the positive x - direction and is normalized to unity .",
    "we are considering the scattering of two electrons , for the case @xmath82 , traveling along the pair of waveguides in the positive x - direction .",
    "initially the electrons enter the system from the left such that electron a begins to the left of electron b and electron a has a slightly larger momentum than electron b. the repulsive interaction potential between the two electrons falls off rapidly enough that asymptotically ( @xmath100 ) the electrons are free .    from the discussion of the classical version of this problem ( for @xmath82 )",
    "we see that there are two asymptotic regimes . in one regime @xmath101 , electron",
    "a remains to the left of electron b , but during the collision they interchange momenta ( this is the only case that is allowed classically ) .",
    "however , quantum mechanically the regime @xmath102 is also allowed .",
    "this would require the wavefunction to tunnel through the barrier in the relative motion problem .",
    "we can now write the asymptotic form of the solution for the relative motion problem in the form @xmath103 the coefficient @xmath20 is the probability amplitude that the electrons interchange position and not momentum during the collision .",
    "the coefficient @xmath104 is the probability amplitude that the electrons interchange momentum and not postion during the collision ( the classically allowed case ) .",
    "the term @xmath105 is the wavefunction for the relative motion before the collision .",
    "if we take the asymptotic limits ( @xmath106 ) of the hypergeometric function we obtain the following expressions for the probability amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath104 @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the gamma function .",
    "we can now write the total wavefunction for the system in the asymptotic regions ( @xmath110,@xmath111 ) and ( @xmath112,@xmath113 ) . for ( @xmath110,@xmath111 )",
    "the total wavefunction is @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the incident wavevectors of electrons a and b. for ( @xmath112,@xmath113 ) the total wavefunction is @xmath117 this simple model of coulomb entanglement predicts no reflection of an individual electron due to the collision , but simply a mutual phase shift of the two electrons and a possible exchange of momenta .",
    "this bodes well for future implementations of such structures in quantum processing devices , as reflection of individual electron probability at the computational gates plays a large role in determining the fidelity of a computation @xcite .",
    "as stated above , in ballistic electron waveguides in gaas - algaas semi - conductor heterostructures the incoming energies of each electron is expected to be near the fermi energy of the device , @xmath118 .",
    "we assume that widths of the waveguides are equal so that the energy required for the first transverse mode is the same . for electrons in the first propagating channel of",
    "the waveguide leads , this means that the momenta of the electrons will be given by @xmath119 and @xmath120 where @xmath121 is deviation in energy from the fermi energy due to the finite temperature of the semiconductor material . for low temperatures we can expect @xmath121 to by very small and therefore the relative momentum of the two electrons to be very small . from above discussion ,",
    "we see that as the relative momentum @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "this would correspond to the electrons exchanging momentum and leaving the interaction region with a mutual phase change of @xmath57 .",
    "this is just what is needed to obtain optimum entanglement in the network described in the previous section .    to determine how the reflection and transmission amplitudes might vary in an implementation of the network at finite temperature , we use numerical values similar to those use in @xcite gaas - algaas quantum networks .",
    "we define a unit of length , @xmath125 and a unit of energy , @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the effective electron mass in gaas - algaas semiconductor structures and @xmath128 is the mass of the free electron .",
    "if we assume that the leads have a transverse width @xmath129 , the the electrons propagate in the first channel for fermi energies @xmath130 .",
    "we use an interaction potential of @xmath131 and an interaction region of length @xmath132 .",
    "fig 6 shows the behavior of the phase angle of the reflection amplitude as the relative momentum varies . for small values of the relative momentum",
    "the reflection amplitude , and therefore the mutual phase between the electron currents , approaches @xmath133 .",
    "fig 7 shows how the reflection probability varies with the relative momentum .",
    "reflection dominates for small relative momentum .    in order to maintain quantum coherence in these types of devices",
    ", temperatures must be on the order of a few degrees kelvin@xcite .",
    "when both qubits are formed at the same semiconductor heterostructure we can assume the same fermi energy value in both qubit structures .",
    "at the low temperatures associated with these types of semiconductor devices the electrons travel with an energy very near the fermi level .",
    "therefore the average deviation from the fermi level of each of our two traveling electrons corresponds to the relative energy of the electrons incident on the interaction region . at small temperatures the electron energy deviates from the fermi energy an average amount @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath20 is the temperature . for a temperature of @xmath136",
    "we find the average separation in energy to be @xmath137 .",
    "this allows us to find the average deviation in each electrons longitudinal momentum , @xmath138 .",
    "taking values for the leads of width @xmath129 and fermi energy @xmath139 we find @xmath140 .",
    "then using a relative momentum of @xmath141 we find near unit probability for momentum exchange and an amplitude phase angle very near @xmath49 so that the phase angle of the amplitude , @xmath142 , is @xmath143 where @xmath144 radians .",
    "we have presented a network for the testing of entanglement in ballistic electron waveguide qubits .",
    "the entangling properties of the coulomb gate are distinguishable for phase angles close to @xmath49 .",
    "the simple model of a coulomb - like coupler predicts a mutual phase angle of the @xmath2 state very near @xmath49 when the relative momentum between the two particles is very small . there is no reflection of individual electrons at the coulomb region .",
