    "tropical geometry is a field of mathematics that uses combinatorial structures to study problems in algebraic geometry .",

    "computations with tropical varieties can extract delicate combinatorial properties of algebraic varieties , and tropical methods can be used to construct finely - tuned examples of varieties with desired properties , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "most of the current algorithms for computing tropical varieties are symbolic and are restricted to tropical varieties defined over algebraically - closed fields .",
    "the past few years have seen the development of new techniques based on numerical algebraic geometry for computing complex tropical varieties in the case of hypersurfaces @xcite and curves @xcite . in this paper , we present a new algorithm for computing complex tropical curves , which we then enhance to compute real tropical curves . we have implemented these algorithms using a combination of matlab and bertini @xcite available at @xcite .",
    "we anticipate that the numerical computation of tropical curves represents a first step towards the numerical computations of higher - dimensional tropical varieties .",
    "another reason to focus on curves , as mentioned in @xcite , is that the computation of tropical curves is an internal step in the computation of other tropical varieties .",
    "moreover , to the best of our knowledge , no other computational techniques exist for real tropical curves .",
    "we hope to extend this to higher - dimensional real tropical varieties as well .",

    "both of these real points contribute one towards the multiplicity of the ray @xmath567 , which corresponds to the second ray listed in the table above .",
    "the two complex values of @xmath565 solving the quartic equation above also contribute one each to the complex multiplicity of this ray , giving a total complex multiplicity of four .",
    "in a recent series of papers , allamigeon , benchimol , gaubert , and joswig @xcite develop a theory of tropical linear programming .",
    "among other things , this enabled them to produce a counterexample to the continuous hirsch conjecture regarding the total curvature of the central path of a linear program .",
    "the central path of a linear program is a segment of an algebraic curve , called the central curve , which joins the analytic center of the feasible polytope and its optimal vertex @xcite .",
    "a family of linear programs was presented in @xcite whose central paths have total curvature that grows exponentially .",
    "we compute the real tropical curve of the central curve of one member of this family , specifically , the linear program from @xcite with @xmath568 : @xmath569 the central curve of this linear program is the projection of a curve in @xmath570 with 14 auxiliary variables @xmath571 defined by the ideal @xmath572    the system consists of 18 variables and 17 equations .",
    "the algebraic variety of this ideal consists of two linear @xmath547-spaces , five planes , four lines , and a degree 10 curve , say @xmath145 .",
    "the linear components belong to the _ disjoint support variety _ described in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath151 be the curve corresponding to @xmath145 as in section  [ sec : patching ] .",
    "the total number of points contained in the intersection of @xmath151 with the union of the coordinate hyperplanes is 22 , all of which are real .",
    "there is a distinct path through each of these 22 points with cycle number one and each point gives a single contribution to the multiplicity of a ray in the complex tropical curve . in particular , the real and complex tropical curves are equal :    crrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr multiplicity & + 6 & @xmath573&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath576 + 3 & @xmath577&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath578 + 1 & @xmath573&@xmath575&@xmath574&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath574&@xmath575&@xmath575&@xmath574&@xmath575&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath575&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath575&@xmath574&@xmath579 + 1 & @xmath580&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath576 + 2 & @xmath580&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath582 + 4 & @xmath573&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath583 + 2 & @xmath573&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath582 + 1 & @xmath584&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath581&@xmath576 + 1 & @xmath573&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath585 + 1 & @xmath584&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath574&@xmath581&@xmath574&@xmath585 +    figure",
