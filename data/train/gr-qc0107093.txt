    "in general relativity , the cosmological constant @xmath0 may be regarded as a measure of the energy density of the vacuum , and can in principle lead to the avoidance of the big - bang singularity which is characteristic of other friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models .",
    "however , the rather simplistic properties of the vacuum that follow from the usual form of einstein s equations can be made more realistic if that theory is extended , which in general leads to a variable @xmath0 .",
    "recently , overduin ( 1999 ) has given an account of variable-@xmath0 models which have a non - singular origin .",
    "here we wish to approach this subject from a different perspective , and give a class of exact solutions wherein @xmath0 can change in a manner that is in agreement with observation but where the singular big bang is replaced by a non - singular `` big bounce '' .",
    "there are several motives for this . in einstein",
    "s theory , the density and pressure of the vacuum are given in terms of the gravitational constant and the speed of light by @xmath1 ( see e.g. adler , bazin and schiffer 1975 or wesson 1999 ) .",
    "however , astrophysical data constrain the values of these to be many orders smaller than the corresponding quantities inferred from particle physics , leading to the cosmological constant problem ( weinberg 1989 ; ng 1992 ; adler , casey and jacob 1995 ) .",
    "this can in principle be resolved by introducing a variable scalar field to the right - hand side of einstein s equations .",
    "there are constraints on this approach , notably from galaxy number counts , gravitational lens statistics and cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( for references see overduin 1999 ; overduin and cooperstock 1998 ) .",
    "also , while it is possible to modify 4d relativity by introducing a scalar field , the latter is most naturally a part of @xmath2d theory .",
    "for example , in 5d kaluza - klein theory the 10 potentials for the gravitational field are augmented by the 4 potentials of electromagnetism and a scalar potential which is related to mass ( see wesson 1999 : even if the electromagnetic potentials are absent and the scalar potential is a constant , the 5d theory implies significant differences from the 4d theory ) .",
    "further , the horizon problem posed by the isotropy of the microwave background in the context of the standard frw models can be resolved by a period of inflation in 4d which is most naturally driven by the dynamics of higher dimensions ( linde 1990 , 1991 ) .",
    "indeed , the most promising route to a unification of classical gravity and electromagnetism with the quantum theory of particle interactions is via @xmath3d manifolds , as in superstrings , supergravity and membrane theory ( west 1986 ; green , schwarz and witten 1987 ; youm 2000 ) .",
    "the latter theories , however , have yet to be developed to the stage where they can be meaningfully tested . by comparison ,",
    "the 5d theory is a modest extension of 4d general relativity and is known to be in agreement with the classical tests in the solar system ( kalligas , wesson and everitt 1995 ; liu and overduin 2000 ) , as well as the less exact data from cosmology ( wesson 1992 ) . we will therefore in what follows go with the minimal extension of general relativity , using previous work on 5d manifolds ( liu and mashhoon 1995 , 2000 ) to see what effects an extra dimension has on @xmath0 and the big bang .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we will give a broad class of 5d solutions and derive their associated 4d properties of matter .",
    "in section 3 we will focus for practical reasons on the sub - class of solutions which is flat in 3d ; and then in sections 4 and 5 study this when the equation of state is that of dust and radiation , respectively .",
    "section 6 is a conclusion .",
    "we choose units such that @xmath4 , and let upper - case latin indices run 0 - 4 and lower - case greek indices run 0 - 3 .",
    "our coordinates are ( @xmath5 ) with @xmath6 . the 5d line element @xmath7",
    "contains the 4d one @xmath8 .",
    "the  5d field equations in terms of the ricci tensor are @xmath9 .",
    "these contain the 4d field equations , which in terms of the einstein tensor and an induced energy - momentum tensor are @xmath10 .",
    "the procedure to go from 5d to 4d is by now well known ( see liu and mashhoon 1995 or wesson 1999 ) , and is guaranteed by campbell s theorem .",
    "there are many classes of solutions of the 5d field equations known , including the much - discussed ponce de leon ( 1988 ) cosmologies .    a new class , which extends the frw solutions and",
    "may be verified by computer , is given by    @xmath11    here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are arbitrary functions , @xmath14 is the 3d curvature index ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 is a constant . after a lengthy calculation",
    "we find that the 5d kretschmann invariant takes the form @xmath17 which shows that @xmath16 determines the curvature of the 5d manifold ( 1 ) .",
    "note that the result ( 2 ) agrees , after rescaling parameters , with that obtained in the so - called canonical coordinates ( liu and mashhoon 1995 ) . from ( 1 ) we can see that the form of @xmath18 is invariant under an arbitrary transformation @xmath19 .",
    "this gives us a freedom to fix one of the two arbitrary functions @xmath20 and *  * @xmath21 without changing the form of solutions ( 1 ) .",
    "the other can be seen to relate to the 4d properties of matter , to which we now proceed .",
    "the 4d line element is @xmath22 this has the robertson - walker form which underlies the standard frw models , and allows us to calculate the non - vanishing components of the 4d ricci tensor : @xmath23 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now from ( 1 ) we have @xmath24 using these in ( 4 ) , we can eliminate @xmath25 and @xmath26 from them to give @xmath27 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these yield the 4d ricci scalar @xmath28 this together with ( 5 ) enables us to form the 4d einstein tensor @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "its non - vanishing components are @xmath31 these give the components of the induced energy - momentum tensor since einstein s equations @xmath32 hold .",
    "let us suppose that the induced matter is a perfect fluid with density @xmath33 and pressure @xmath34 moving with a 4-velocity @xmath35 , plus a cosmological term whose nature is to be determined : @xmath36 as in the frw models , we can take the matter to be comoving in 3d , so @xmath37 and @xmath38 . then ( 8) and ( 7 ) yield @xmath39 these are the analogs for our solution ( 1 ) of the friedmann equations for the frw solutions .",
    "as there , we are free to choose an equation of state , which we take to be the isothermal one @xmath40 here @xmath41 is a constant , which for ordinary matter lies in the range ( dust ) @xmath42 ( radiation or ultrarelativistic particles ) . using ( 10 ) in ( 9 ) we can isolate the density of matter and the cosmological term : @xmath43 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in these relations , @xmath12 is still arbitrary and @xmath44 is given by ( 1 ) .",
    "the matter density therefore has a wide range of forms and the cosmological `` constant '' is variable .",
    "let us now consider singularities of the 5d manifold ( 1 ) .",
    "since metric ( 1 ) is 5d ricci flat , we have @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the third 5d invariant is given in ( 2 ) , from which we see that @xmath47 ( with @xmath48 ) corresponds to a 5d singularity .",
    "this is a physical singularity and , as is in general relativity , can be naturally explained as a `` big bang '' singularity . from ( 6 ) and ( 11 ) we also see that if @xmath49 then all @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath0 become infinity .",
    "this means that @xmath49 ( with @xmath52 ) represents a second kind of singularities where the 4d scalar curvature @xmath50 , the 4d induced mass density @xmath51 and @xmath0 diverge . clearly , this is a 4d singularity at which the 5d invariant ( 2 ) may keep normal .",
    "we can naturally explain this one as a `` big bounce '' singularity at which the scale factor @xmath53 reaches it s minimum with @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath49 ( with @xmath54 implies @xmath55 by ( 1 ) .",
    "so we conclude that _ our 5d models ( 1 ) may have two kinds of singularities , `` big bang '' and `` big bounce '' , characterized by _ @xmath47 _  and _ @xmath55 _  , respectively_. here @xmath56 is the scale factor of the 3d space and we can call @xmath25 the scale factor of the time . in the following sections we will see a realization of the 5d `` big bounce '' models .",
    "astrophysical data , including the age of the universe , are compatible with an frw model with flat space sections ( leonard and lake 1995 ; overduin 1999 ) .",
    "we therefore put @xmath57 in ( 1 ) , which gives @xmath58 the corresponding relations ( 11 ) become @xmath59 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but as mentioned above , one of the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 which appear in ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) is free to choose without loss of generality . a convenient choice and the corresponding form of @xmath60 are given by : @xmath61 here",
    "@xmath62 is a constant and @xmath12 is the only function left undetermined .",
    "it is well known in general relativity that the isolation of a cosmological term from densities @xmath51 and @xmath34 is not unique : one can always get @xmath0 absorbed into @xmath51 and @xmath34 .",
    "the only thing which is of physical importance is the equation of state satisfied by @xmath51 and @xmath34 .",
    "this has things to do with the vacuum energy .",
    "it is expected that the vacuum energy could be contributed by either @xmath0 or dark matter , or by both . without a better model for the dark matter",
    ", we do not know how to separate them .",
    "so we assume that _ all constituents of _ @xmath0 _  which evolve like an ordinary matter through _",
    "@xmath63 _ have already been absorbed into _",
    "@xmath51 _  and _ @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , we also assume that the remaining @xmath0 is small compared with @xmath51 in the present universe .",
    "then , to fix @xmath64 we will impose a condition on the cosmological term @xmath0 in equations ( 13 ) that as the model expands to infinity , @xmath0 tends to zero more rapidly than @xmath51 .",
    "[ the relative sizes of @xmath0 and @xmath51 will then be given by ( 13 ) and depend on the epoch . ] to implement this condition , we recall that in the @xmath57 frw model the scale factor is of a power law .",
    "this reminds us to try to use a power law for @xmath20 in ( 14 ) , which give .",
    "@xmath65 the last of these shows that the power @xmath66 determines the behavior of the scale factor @xmath60 on the hypersurface @xmath67 constant which is spacetime . specifically , we find that @xmath68 for @xmath69 as @xmath70 .",
    "this into ( 13 ) gives @xmath71 these are observationally acceptable behaviors for ordinary matter ( leonard and lake 1995 ) and the cosmological term ( overduin 1999 ) .",
    "however , the condition that @xmath0 decays faster than @xmath51 means that we must have @xmath72 .",
    "this with @xmath68 and @xmath73 in ( 12 ) gives @xmath74 constant , for  @xmath70 .",
    "this means that the usual proper time is recovered if we let @xmath75 for @xmath70 .",
    "then the constant @xmath62 in ( 14 ) is @xmath76 we see that the value of this parameter depends on whether the matter is cold or hot .    to complete this section , it is useful to recap the analysis and state the result explicitly : the class of exact solutions ( 1 ) is very rich algebraically ; so we appeal to astrophysics to argue that @xmath57 which gives ( 12 ) , and to argue that @xmath0 decays faster than @xmath51 which fixes @xmath20 and gives ( 17 ) .",
    "the result is a spatially - flat cosmological solution with good physical properties given by @xmath77 this solution has some features in common with others in the literature and some which are different",
    ". a catalog of exact solutions of the 5d field equations ( @xmath9 ) has been given by wesson ( 1999 ) , who has also discussed the standard technique wherein these equations are reduced to einstein s ( @xmath10 ) to obtain the properties of matter .",
    "in this regard , it is important to note that matter is related to the 4d space and its curvature .",
    "thus the much - discussed 5d cosmologies due to ponce de leon ( 1988 ) are flat in 5d but curved in 4d .",
    "that is why they contain matter .",
    "however , the ponce de leon cosmologies are separable in @xmath78 and @xmath79 , reducing to frw ones on the hypersurfaces @xmath67 constants .",
    "in contrast , the cosmologies ( 1 ) and their 3d - flat subset ( 18 ) are not separable . to distinguish between models of the ponce de leon kind and",
    "those discussed here will require new methods which probe the dynamics associated with the @xmath79-dependence of the solutions .",
    "this could involve new tests of gravity in the solar system , such as the planned space test of the equivalence principle ( wesson 1996 ; overduin 2000 ) .",
    "but tests of 5d models could also be made astrophysically , and to this end we will examine in the following two sections the implications of ( 18 ) for cold and hot matter .",
    "for @xmath80 in ( 10 ) the equation of state is @xmath81 for dust , which is believed to describe the matter content of the late universe . in this case by ( 18 ) we have @xmath82 , @xmath83 for the constants and @xmath84 for the function which describes the scale factor .",
    "the latter is given explicitly by    @xmath85    we have examined this numerically for various values of the hypersurfaces @xmath86 constants and the three possible values of the normalized 5d curvature parameter @xmath16 which appears in ( 2 ) , namely @xmath87 . note that @xmath88 is too special to represent a typical @xmath67 constant hypersurface , because in that case the last two terms in ( 19 ) do not contribute to the scale factor @xmath89 .",
    "we find that in most other cases the results are similar . here",
    "we present only one for the purpose of illustration .",
    "thus figure @xmath90 is a plot of @xmath56 versus @xmath78 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "we see that there is a finite minimum of @xmath56 at @xmath93 , before which the universe contracts and after which it expands . this kind of behavior can happen in 4d frw models which have a large value of a constant @xmath0 ( robertson and noonan 1968 ) . but most frw models have a singularity in the geometry and divergent properties of matter because @xmath94 for @xmath95 , defining the big bang . here",
    "the situation is different . by ( 2 )",
    ", the 5d geometry would be singular if @xmath94 , but by ( 19 ) this would only happen on the special hypersurfaces defined by the roots of that equation .",
    "in general , on @xmath67 constant hypersurfaces the 5d curvature invariant ( 2 ) is finite .",
    "however , at @xmath93 we have @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "so by ( 18 ) we have @xmath55 at @xmath93 .",
    "thus , as discussed in section 2 , we get a `` big bounce '' model in which all @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath0 diverge at @xmath93 except the 5d invariant ( 2 ) , which keeps normal .    to investigate this and other aspects of the model , we note from figure 1 that @xmath98 is of order unity so we can study the cases @xmath99 and @xmath100",

    "it is known that a major difficulty of the 4d big bounce models in standard general relativity ( robertson and noonan 1968 ) is that the collapsing phase would typically generate enormous inhomogeneities . here",

    "firstly , our models are not symmetric before and after the big bounce . secondly , in our models",
    ", the contraction and expansion of the universe around the bounce was accompanied by matter creation . if the process of the contraction of the universe before the bounce was dominated not by collapsing of previously formed matter but by creating of new matter , ( this is very possible because in our models the universe was empty at the beginning of the contracting , ) then hopefully the inhomogeneity problem could be resolved .",
    "we are aware that the present work is exploratory . while our solutions are quite general , we have restricted their application by assuming that ordinary matter and the vacuum can be described by a perfect fluid , by adopting an isothermal equation of state for the matter , by concentrating on the spatially flat case , and that only for dust and radiation .",
    "all of these restrictions could be removed in future work .",
    "however , we have shown that adding only one extra dimension to general relativity makes the big bang a subject of fruitful analysis and not just a no - go singularity ."
