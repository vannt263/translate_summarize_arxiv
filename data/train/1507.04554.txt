    "both epidemic spreading  @xcite and traffic transportation  @xcite are two types of fundamental dynamical processes on complex networks .",
    "the past fifteen years have witnessed a great deal of effort in exploring and understanding these processes .",
    "intuitively , spreading should be greatly affected by the transportation dynamics as the traffic flows determine the paths along which a virus or information can propagate .",
    "nevertheless , for a long time , the two types of dynamical processes were studied separately .",
    "the first series of works to incorporate traffic dynamics into epidemic spreading were done using the metapopulation model  @xcite . in particular , consider a spatially extended system of a large number of individuals . in a metapopulation model , all the individuals are grouped into a number of spatially structured subpopulations interacting with each other in a manner that can be described as a network .",
    "the links in the network represent the traveling paths of individuals across different subpopulations .",
    "an infected individual can infect other individuals in the same subpopulation .",
    "the metapopulation model has been used to simulate the spread of human and animal diseases ( such as sars and h1n1 ) among different cities . in 2009 , meloni et al .",
    "proposed another traffic - driven epidemic spreading model  @xcite , where each node corresponds to a router ( e.g. , in a computer network ) and the virus can spread among nodes through the transmission of packets .",
    "a susceptible node will be infected with certain probability every time it receives a packet from an infected neighboring node .",
    "this model is quite suitable for studying computer virus propagation .    the model of meloni et al .",
    "@xcite has become a prototypical framework to address a variety of issues in traffic - driven epidemic spreading . for traffic flow dynamics on complex networks ,",
    "an essential ingredient is the routing strategy . in the model",
    ", one can demonstrate that epidemic spreading can be modulated or controlled through a proper choice of the local routing strategy  @xcite or global routing protocol  @xcite . for a fixed routing strategy , the network structure can also affect the spreading dynamics .",
    "for example , by increasing the average network connectivity , one can effectively delay epidemic outbreaks  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the epidemic threshold can be enhanced by deliberately removing a subset of links associated with the large - degree nodes or the edges with the largest algorithmic betweenness  @xcite .    in previous studies of traffic - driven epidemic spreading , the networks were assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "in such a network , the average degree of the neighboring nodes is uniform across nodes .",
    "however , many real - world networks display various degrees of mixing patterns  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , a network is assortatively ( disassortatively ) mixing if high - degree nodes tend to connect with high - degree ( low - degree ) nodes .",
    "quantitatively , degree mixing can be characterized by the assortativity coefficient  @xcite : @xmath0^{2}}{m^{-1}\\sum_{i}\\frac{1}{2}(j_{i}^{2}+k_{i}^{2 } ) -[m^{-1}\\sum_{i}\\frac{1}{2}(j_{i}+k_{i})]^{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are the degrees of the nodes at the ends of the @xmath3th edge , @xmath4 is the number of edges in the network , and @xmath5 . for standard network models such as the erds - rnyi random graphs  @xcite and the barabsi - albert scale - free networks  @xcite ,",
    "the assortativity coefficient @xmath6 is zero , indicating complete lack of degree correlation . for many social networks ,",
    "the assortativity coefficient @xmath6 is positive .",
    "however , technological and biological networks tend to be disassortative with negative values of @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    ", we study quantitatively how degree mixing , the most pronounced feature of correlated networks , affects traffic - driven epidemic spreading .",
    "interestingly , we find a non - monotonic behavior in that the threshold can be minimized for some critical value of the assortativity coefficient .",
    "to understand this phenomenon , we employ a degree - based mean - field theory , which allows us to calculate the traffic - driven epidemic threshold in correlated networks .",
    "we find that the threshold is inversely proportional to the packet - generation rate - a key parameter characterizing the traffic dynamics , as well as the largest eigenvalue of the betweenness matrix .",
    "moreover , the epidemic threshold is negatively correlated with the maximum algorithmic betweenness .",
    "our theory predicts the existence of a critical value of the assortativity coefficient at which the epidemic threshold reaches its minimum , which agrees with the results from direct numerical simulations .",

    "@xcite to obtain networks with desired degree mixing patterns .",
    "specifically , in order to obtain an assortative network , at each step we randomly choose two different edges with four different ends , and then purposefully swap the two edges by linking the vertices with higher degrees and lower degrees , respectively . repeating this procedure",
    "while forbidding multiple connections and disconnected components , we generate a network with certain degree assortativity without altering the degree distribution of the original network . through the opposite operation",
