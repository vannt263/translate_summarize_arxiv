    "this so - called nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) , see @xcite , has several shortcomings , such as the exclusion of excited states , in particular continuum correlations , and the failure to account for the interaction between the different components ( single nucleons as well as nuclei ) that is indispensable when approaching saturation density .",
    "both problems are discussed in the present work .    to describe correlations in warm dense matter",
