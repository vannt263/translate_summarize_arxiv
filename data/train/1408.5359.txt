    "spin tunneling in molecular magnets has been subject of intensive research in the last 20 years @xcite . these systems exhibit unique quantum features that show up in macroscopic experiments . among them",
    "are stepwise quantum hysteresis due to resonant tunneling at discrete values of the magnetic field @xcite , topological berry phase effects @xcite , magnetic deflagration @xcite , and rabi oscillations @xcite .",
    "most recently , experiments with individual magnetic molecules bridged between conducting leads and molecules grafted on carbon nanotubes have been performed that permit readout of quantum states of individual atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "quantum superposition of spin states in magnetic molecules makes them candidates for qubits  elements of quantum computers @xcite .    beginning with the discovery of resonant spin tunneling in mn@xmath0 acetate",
    "@xcite it has been generally believed that at the macroscopic level the effect can only be observed in a single crystal or in the array of microcrystallites whose crystallographic axes are aligned .",
    "the latter method was used in refs . , and",
    "in a few subsequent publications by the same authors , before sufficiently large single crystals of molecular magnets had become available . nowadays a large number of new molecular magnets are synthesized by chemists every year and subsequently tested by physicists for the presence of spin tunneling . in many cases growing a sufficiently large single crystal",
    "is a challenging task as compared to growing microcrystals . at the same time the effectiveness of the room - temperature alignment of microscrystals by a high magnetic field in ,",
    "e.g. , an epoxy strongly depends on the shape of the crystallites and may also be incompatible with their chemistry .    in this paper",
    "we show that neither macroscopic single crystals or the alignment of microcrystals are necessary to obtain solid evidence of spin tunneling in macroscopic magnetic measurements of molecular magnets .",
    "this can be done by simply measuring the magnetization curve , @xmath1 , and plotting the derivative of the magnetization on the magnetic field , d@xmath2/d@xmath3 . to illustrate this point we use amorphous nanospheres of mn@xmath0 acetate @xcite .",
    "such nanospheres neither form crystals nor they allow to align easy magnetization axes of mn@xmath0 molecules in a high magnetic field because of their isotropic magnetic susceptibility .",
    "first magnetic measurements of similar mn@xmath0 nanoparticles were performed in refs . where peaks in d@xmath2/d@xmath3 were observed and attributed to quantum tunneling .",
    "however , no explanation to such observation in a disordered sample has been provided .",
    "zero - field cooled magnetization curve of the measured sample revealed large , up to @xmath4% , fraction of fast - relaxing species of mn@xmath0 acetate .",
    "this resulted in a complicated pattern of displaced tunneling maxima as compared to typical resonances in a mn@xmath0 crystal that are separated by about @xmath5 koe .",
    "highly amorphous mn@xmath0 particles used in our experiments did not show any visible presence of the second species .",
    "sharp tunneling maxima in d@xmath2/d@xmath3 have been observed .",
    "their location coincided with the position of tunneling maxima in a mn@xmath0 crystal .",
    "we provide theoretical analysis that explains observation of tunneling resonances in a fully disordered sample .",
    "the predicted post - resonance field dependence of the peaks agrees with experiment .",
    "the practical value of this observation is that it can greatly reduce the preliminary work by chemists that is required to search for quantum spin tunneling in newly synthesized molecular magnets .",
    "as long as the magnetic molecules preserve their structure , the disordered sample of crystallites of any size is sufficient for that task .",

    "the size of the particles was calculated from fesem images by averaging the diameter of at least @xmath13 particles from different areas of the sample .",
    "the average size of 237 @xmath14 69 nm and the median size of @xmath15 nm were determined .",

    "as we shall see from magnetic measurements , however , the mn@xmath0 molecules are well preserved in the nanospheres despite of the structural disorder .",
    "amorphous or highly disordered structure of mn@xmath0 nanospheres raises the question whether the easy axes of mn@xmath0 molecules inside the spheres are aligned or disordered .",
    "one should notice in this connection that the direction of the easy axis is related to the orientation of the molecules while the bragg peaks in the x - ray scattering are related to the translational order in a crystal .",
    "in an amorphous solid the orientation of local crystallographic axes is more robust than the translational order @xcite .",
    "it may spread well beyond the amorphous structure factor .",
    "evidence of the extended correlations in the orientation of local magnetic anisotropy axes has been previously reported in amorphous magnets @xcite .",
    "for the conclusions made in this paper it does not matter whether the easy axes of the molecules are disordered at the level of individual nanospheres , or due to the random orientation of nanospheres , or both .",
    "low - temperature magnetic measurements have been carried out on a compressed powdered sample inside a commercial rf - squid quantum design magnetometer . before conducting the measurements , an attempt has been made to orient the nanoparticles by a high magnetic field at room temperature in the epoxy , as has been done previously with @xmath23m - size microcrystals .",
    "contrary to the latter case , the orienting procedure applied to the nanospheres rendered no difference in the magnetization data .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that micron - size crystallites of mn@xmath0 acetate grow elongated along the easy magnetization axis .",
    "the resulting anisotropy of their magnetic susceptibility then enables the alignment of the crystallites by a high magnetic field in a stycast , even though the molecules do not have magnetic moments at room temperature .",
