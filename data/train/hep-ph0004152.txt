    "during bcp3 there was much discussion of how well we can determine the parameters in the ckm matrix . in practice , this means finding the allowed region , at a certain confidence level , in the @xmath1 plane - with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being the usual wolfenstein @xcite parameters .",
    "the ingredients of the global fits discussed here particularly by stocchi @xcite , as well as by kim @xcite and eigen @xcite , are crucially dependent on the errors one assigns to the values one infers experimentally for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite  @xcite although the data on @xmath6 coming from the tevatron @xcite , and now also from aleph ,   @xcite  @xcite is not accurate enough to have much impact on the allowed region in the @xmath7 plane , the sharpened lep bound on @xmath8 , presented here by willocq ,   @xcite provides a significant restriction .",
    "when considering the result of the ckm fits , it is important to distinguish three different ingredients that enter into these fits    \\i ) there are a number of experimental inputs which have quite _ negligible experimental errors_. these include : the cp - violating parameter @xmath9 ; the @xmath10 mass difference , @xmath11 ; the @xmath8 bound mentioned above ;   @xcite and the value of the sine of the cabibbo angle , @xmath12 .",
    "\\ii ) there are a number of parameters which have , what one may call _ controllable errors_. these include @xmath5 ; the ratio @xmath13 and the @xmath14-breaking parameter @xmath15 .",
    "\\iii ) there are also associated theoretical parameters , whose errors are due to _ theoretical uncertaintes _ in determining appropriate hadronic matrix elements .",
    "these include @xmath16 , the parameter which measures how different the matrix element @xmath17 is from the vacuum saturation result @xmath18 ; and the analogous parameter for the @xmath19 system , @xmath20 , which is connected to the matrix element @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters with _ controllable errors _ , in principle , are the ones which can be improved using more experimental information .  .",
    "similar ideas can be brought to bear on @xmath22 and also on @xmath23 . ]",
    "in contrast , it is difficult to reduce , or even correctly estimate , the theoretical errors associated with parameters like @xmath16 , because they are connected with the way one attempts to calculate the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "although soni @xcite in this meeting has given 15% errors on @xmath16 and @xmath24  @xmath25 ;  @xmath26 $ ] , the systematic error on each of these quantities is much harder to pin down , since it depends on the uncertainties associated with going from a quenched to a fully unquenched calculation of the relevant matrix elements .",
    "the fit of stocchi shown in fig .",
    "1 uses the parameters detailed in table 1 .",
    "although i find this set of parameters ( and the fit ! ) perfectly reasonable , i believe that one should not take the 95% confidence limit region shown in fig . 1 strictly as such .",
    "there is enough `` theoretical error '' in this whole business that the most prudent approach is to transform a `` formal '' 95% confidence limit region into an `` effective '' 68% limit region . even after doing such an unorthodox thing , one can",
    "not but be impressed by how well the ckm model fits the data !    .",
    "input parameters for the fit in fig .",
    "1 , from reference [ 2 ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as i mentioned earlier , the new result from lep reported here by willocq  @xcite on the @xmath27 mass difference is of considerable importance for the final @xmath1 plane fit .",
    "last year this parameter was bounded a bit more weakly @xmath28 so that the final @xmath7 plane fit permitted values of @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite with the present bound , however , one can not contemplate any longer negative values for @xmath2 a point emphasized by deshpande @xcite at this meeting .",
    "if @xmath30 , it follows that the ckm cp - violating phase @xmath31 can not be as large as @xmath32 . in turn , this implies that one can not any longer contemplate the superweak solution for the unitarity triangle angles @xmath33 and @xmath34 , in which @xmath35 .",
    "indeed , the fit of the ckm parameters presented by stocchi here leads to a best value for @xmath36 and @xmath37 which are quite different from each other :   @xcite @xmath38    i remark , that the 95% confidence limit on @xmath39 which one infers from the ckm analysis , @xmath40 is precisely in the range determined by present experiments .",
    "the value reported here for @xmath41 , obtained by aleph  @xcite  @xcite @xmath42 when combined with the cdf result @xcite [ @xmath43 , leads to an average value @xmath44 which is perfectly compatible with the range for @xmath36 obtained indirectly from the ckm analysis .",
    "furthermore , this experimental result , by itself , is already almost significant statistically .",
    "it is possible to imagine improving considerably the allowed value for @xmath45 and other unitarity triangle parameters by improving the _ controllable errors _ on @xmath46 and on the other parameters which enter in the ckm analysis .",
    "let me illustrate how these improvements can come about by focusing specifically on the case of @xmath5 .",
    "if one could trust the parton model , and one knew the mass of the b - quark precisely , one could directly extract @xmath47 from the semileptonic width for b - quarks to decay into final states containing c - quarks , given by the standard formula :    @xmath48    this formula , however , is of no use since @xmath49 itself is not known precisly enough and , furthermore , there are corrections to the parton model !    what one does , in practice , is to use the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) to replace @xmath49 by the mass of the b - meson . in so doing the rate ( 5 ) above",
    "is corrected by the addition of terms involving the matrix elements of the operators @xmath50 which enter in the operator produced expansion underlying the hqet .",
    "@xcite to @xmath51 one has two new operators contributing to the total width , which are characterized by two parameters @xmath52 , and @xmath53 given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the gluon field strength tensor .",
    "in addition , to this order in the heavy quark expansion ,   @xcite the fermi momentum @xmath56 enters in the formulas relating the mass of the b - quark to that of the @xmath57 and @xmath58 mesons :    @xmath59    using the physical masses for @xmath60 and @xmath61 yields directly a value for @xmath62 $ ] .    using the heavy quark expansion one can obtain a formula for the semileptonic rate @xmath63 which involves @xmath64 rather than @xmath49 , at the price of some corrections involving @xmath65 , and @xmath56 .",
    "one finds , including leading order qcd effects , @xcite the formula :    @xmath66\\\\ & \\cdot &   \\{1 - 1.65 \\frac{{\\bar{\\lambda}}}{m_{b}}\\ - 3.18 \\frac{\\lambda_1}{m_b^2 } + 0.02 \\frac{\\lambda_2}{m_b^2 } + ... \\}~.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath67 is a phase space factor , while the first square bracket contains the @xmath68 perturbative qcd corrections .",
    "the terms in the curly brackets are the dominant corrections coming from the heavy quark expansion .",
    "if , besides @xmath53 , one knew @xmath52 and @xmath56 with good accuracy , one could determine @xmath69 from the semileptonic width with a small @xmath70 theory error .",
    "the parameters @xmath65 , and @xmath56 are , in principle , _ controllable _ since they can be inferred from properties of the lepton spectrum and of the hadronic mass spectrum in non - leptonic @xmath57-decays .",
    "@xcite specifically , moments of the lepton spectrum and/or the hadronic mass spectrum can be used to determine @xmath52 and @xmath56 .    unfortunately , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , a preliminary analysis by the cleo collaboration  presented here by thaler @xcite  give inconsistent results . the values for @xmath52 and @xmath71 determined from the leptonic spectrum do not seem to agree with those computed from an analysis of the moments of the hadronic mass spectrum .",
    "in my view , the latter values @xmath72 ;   @xmath73   gev ] are probably more trustworthy , since they are less sensitive to some of the necessary experimental cuts .",
    "indeed , these values are quite close to the values reported by w. m. zhang @xcite at this meeting , coming from a b - bound state analysis using an explicit phenomenological wavefunction for the b - meson . at any rate , using these techniques , it is likely that one will be able to eventually reduce the theoretical error on @xmath47 to about @xmath74 and on @xmath75 to about @xmath76 , with a corresponding reduction of the allowed region in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "as misiak @xcite discussed in bcp3 , this same approach can be used in other contexts  in particular , to better constrain the dependence on the photon energy of the branching ratio for @xmath77 above some minimum photon energy cut .",
    "there is reasonable theoretical understanding of the specific pattern of lifetimes of heavy hadrons containing @xmath78 and @xmath79 quarks .",
    "this topic was reviewed here by bigi  @xcite and specific aspects were considered by melic  @xcite and by yang  @xcite . however , as the data on these lifetimes is now rather precise ,   @xcite a puzzle has emerged .",
    "i want to discuss this briefly here .",
    "one can understand the total decay width  and hence the lifetime  of a heavy hadron theoretically via the hqet .",
    "the total width is given by the discontinuity of the correlator of the weak hamiltonian responsible for the decay with itself .",
    "this discontinuity is given by a sum of matrix elements of operators of increasing dimensonality , arising in an operator product expansion of the correlator .",
    "schematically , one finds in this way the formula  @xcite    @xmath80 ~ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath81 is the mass of the heavy quark . as can be gleaned from the above ,",
    "the expansion parameter for the total width is of order @xmath82 .",
    "hence one expects that the effects of the non - leading terms in eq . ( 9 ) should be bigger in charm decays than in bottom decays .",
    "indeed , experimentally @xmath83 while the @xmath84 and @xmath85 lifetimes are nearly equal @xmath86  @xcite ]    more specifically , the situation regarding the decays of charmed hadrons seems rather satisfactory .",
    "@xcite the dominant effect that causes the large difference between the lifetimes of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 mesons can be traced to the pauli interference  @xcite originating from the 4-fermion term in eq .",
    "these 4-fermion terms are also crucial to explain the pattern of charmed baryon lifetimes , as detailed by melic  @xcite at this meeting .",
    "the fact that @xmath89 is near to 1.2  @xmath90  @xcite ] is probably evidence for some weak annihilation contribution @xmath91 in the @xmath92 width .",
    "if so , perhaps one should be able to see some evidence for glueball or @xmath93 decays of the @xmath92 , processes like @xmath94 glueball @xmath95 ; @xmath96 .",
    "although the prediction that the lifetime differences in the @xmath57-sector should be small is well borne out by the data , there is a nagging problem with the @xmath97 lifetime .",
    "@xcite the pauli interference effects suppress the lifetime of the @xmath97 relative to that of the @xmath19-meson and one can write @xmath98 bigi  @xcite estimates @xmath99 , while melic  @xcite can push @xmath100 to perhaps @xmath101 by taking a very light @xmath79-quark mass . however , experimentally this ratio is closer to 0.8 , with the latest results giving @xmath102 .",
    "@xcite it is possible that this signals a real discrepancy between theory and experiment that needs explaining .",
    "however , in my view , given the fine agreement of all the other heavy hadron lifetimes with the predictions coming from hqet , perhaps one should not worry overmuch at this stage about a ( 2 - 3 ) @xmath103 discrepancy .",
    "hopefully , future data from the tevatron should help resolve this issue .",
    "at bcp3 there was lots of discussion of 2-body charmless @xmath57-decay .",
    "data on these decays was presented by j. smith  @xcite and j. alexander  @xcite , while various theoretical aspects were touched upon by h - y cheng  @xcite ; c. d. lu  @xcite , h .-",
    "n . li  @xcite , m. suzuki  @xciteand c. bhattacharya .",
    "@xcite    h.- y. cheng  @xcite in particular , summarized the recent considerable progress achieved in calculating within qcd the relative rates for the decays of @xmath57-meson into 2 pseudoscalar states @xmath104 $ ] , 2 vector states @xmath105 $ ] and a vector and a pseudoscalar state @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "the present treatment formalizes ( and , in a sense , justifies and explains ) the old diagrammatic approach to this problem of ling lie chau .",
    "@xcite the basic idea of these calculations is well known .",
    "one starts with an effective weak hamiltonian given by a sum of operators    @xmath107    and one tries to estimate the matrix elements of these operators by using factorization .",
    "however , then one correct this procedure by including ( some ) non - factorizable pieces .    technically , when one uses factorization , in the process of splitting up the operators as a product of currents the scale dependence of the matrix elements of @xmath108 is not preserved : @xmath109 however , one can reorganize the wilson coefficient expansion  @xcite to effectively recover @xmath110-independent coefficients @xmath111 - at least to @xmath112 .",
    "for penguin operators these effects are rather large , amounting to about a @xmath113 increase for @xmath114 .",
    "@xcite non - factorizable contributions are incorporated as @xmath115 corrections . as cheng  @xcite discussed , the recent advance comes from understanding that , depending on which operator @xmath50 one is considering , the correction factors have different @xmath116-factors associated with them .",
    "this has been justified in the heavy quark limit recently by beneke , buchalla , neubert and sachrajda .",
    "@xcite in particular , for @xmath117 operators @xmath118 , while for @xmath119 operators @xmath120 .",
    "y. cheng  @xcite compared the theoretical predictions resulting from the above considerations with experimental results .",
    "the overall comparison is quite good , but there are two extant problems .",
    "these are :    \\i ) it is difficult to get the branching ratio @xmath121 as is observed experimentally .",
    "typically , one finds much larger @xmath122 branching fractions than are observed .",
    "\\ii ) it is very hard to push the @xmath123 to the very large level observed @xmath124 typically , theoretically one can reach at most @xmath125 .",
    "in fact , to get to values as large as this , it is necessary that @xmath126 for @xmath117 operators , as is suggested theoretically .",
    "j. smith  @xcite discussed a , theoretically less sophisticated , fit of the measured charmless @xmath57-decays . in this fit , which was carried out by hou , smith and w@xmath127rtheim ,",
    "@xcite one simply considers the amplitude for the b - decays in question to be given by a tree plus a penguin contribution , neglecting throughout any strong rescattering phases .",
    "further , these authors use ( naive ) factorization to calculate the relevant matrix elements . since the tree amplitudes depended on the ckm phase @xmath31",
    "@xmath128 $ ] , this fit determines this phase .",
    "remarkably the fit discussed by smith  @xcite determines @xmath31 quite accurately : @xmath129 however , it is difficult to judge the reliability of the approach .",
    "furthermore , also in this case the branching fraction for the decay @xmath130 is too low  @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "the situation regarding _ direct cp - asymmetries _ is much less clear , both experimentally and theoretically , experimentally , as alexander  @xcite indicated , one is statistics limited so that @xmath132 is typically of @xmath133 . for example , one has  @xcite @xmath134 improvements will scale as @xmath135 and one will need an integrated luminosity of @xmath136 to get to @xmath137    theoretically to be able to predict these direct cp - asymmetries one needs a good estimate of the strong rescattering phases . if one writes for the amplitudes of two charge -conjugate processes @xmath138 one sees that @xmath139 vanishes if there is no strong rescattering phase @xmath140 between the two amplitudes :    @xmath141    where @xmath142 . for sizeable effects , in addition to having a non - negligible rescattering phase , one needs a relatively large weak cp - violating phase @xmath143 ( which is probably ok in the ckm model ) and a ratio @xmath144 .",
    "since , typically , the two amplitudes involved are penguin and tree amplitudes , one needs these amplitudes to be comparable in size and to have a large rescattering phase between them  not too likely a possibility !",
    "numerically , for example , if @xmath145 and @xmath146 , one obtains @xmath147 .    at bcp3 three different approaches were discussed to try to estimate the rescattering phases @xmath140 which one might expect .",
    "all three approaches have some inherent difficulties , demonstrating how challenging really it is to have a reliable estimate for @xmath140 .",
    "c. d. lu  @xcite used the old idea of bander , silverman and soni  @xcite to extract a rescattering phase simply from the phase associated with the discontinuity of penguin graphs .",
    "this phase depends on the momentum transfer carried by the gluon , @xmath148 .",
    "however , since the relevant @xmath149 are rather low , it is natural to question whether one can trust the discontinuity calculated in a pure quark picture to such values of @xmath149 . in contrast , h .-",
    "li  @xcite in his talk at bcp3 estimated @xmath140 as the rescattering phase which emerges in the brodsky - lepage bound state formalism  @xcite by means of factorization . in this case",
    ", the question is whether one can really use these techniques given the large energy release in the decay process @xmath150 .",
    "mahiko suzuki  @xcite presented a more general discussion of the problem based on hadronic methods .",
    "he argued , i believe correctly , that it is really difficult to apply perturbative qcd ideas  even if one includes some resummation  for the process at hand , since the effective scale is only of order @xmath151 gev .",
    "however , suzuki also pointed out that the rescattering phase @xmath140 is also difficult to estimate by hadronic methods .",
    "this is because the phase associated with , say , the @xmath152 final state is not simply the phase associated with elastic @xmath153 scattering . for the energies in question @xmath154 and most of the states that contribute in the above sum are inelastic ( roughtly 80% ) .",
    "given this fact , suzuki tried to estimate the effective phase @xmath140 that emerges by using a random phase approximation .",
    "using this approximation , he was able to correlate the resulting phase @xmath140 with the elasticity of the process , with the result depending on how favored or disfavored is the factorization of the amplitude .",
    "when factorization is not favoreda @xmath140 is bigger .",
    "however , if one really has a large rescattering phase @xmath140 there are also sizable distorsions of the amplitude  a result which suzuki  @xcite points out was first understood by fermi !",
    "basically , not only is there a change in the imaginary part associated with the amplitude , but also the real part is affected : @xmath155~.\\ ] ] these considerations make it unlikely that one will be able to really ever get a reliable theoretical prediction for a direct cp - asymmetry .",
    "however , this fact should not discourage experimentalists from looking for such cp - asymmetries .",
    "in the last year , the new results on @xmath0 announced by ktev  @xcite and by the na48 collaboration  @xcite have generated an enormous amount of interest .",
    "not surprisingly , this subject was also a topic of considerable discussion at bcp3 .      in bcp3 the experimental situation regarding @xmath0",
    "was reviewed by a. roodman  @xcite and by a. nappi  @xcite , while the theoretical aspets of these recent results were discussed by bertolini ,  @xcite soni ,  @xcite masiero ,  @xcite and soldan .",
    "@xcite in my view , the nicest aspect of the new ktev / na48 results is that they resolve the discrepancy that existed betwen the old fermilab result , coming from the e731 experiment ,  @xcite and the results of the old cern experiment na31 .",
    "@xcite the present results for @xmath0 : @xmath156}\\\\ ( 18.5 \\pm   7.3 ) \\times 10^{-4}~~ { \\rm ref~ [ 36]}\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] when combined with the e731 and na31 results lead to a world average value for this quantity : @xmath157 which clearly establishes the existence of @xmath158 cp - violation .",
    "this result provides the first _ direct _",
    "confirmation that @xmath159 or , equivalently , that @xmath160 something which could only be inferred from the ckm analysis we discussed earlier .",
    "this said , however , it is difficult to extract from the present measurement of @xmath0 a precise value for @xmath3 .",
    "this is because the value of  @xmath0 , although proportional to @xmath3 , is rather uncertain due to uncertainties in the calculation of the relevant hadronic matrix element .",
    "this point was emphasized by bertolini  @xcite at this meeting .",
    "his argument can be illustrated by making use of an approximate formula for @xmath0 due to buras and his collaborators .",
    "@xcite as is well known , both matrix elements of gluonic penguin operators and of electroweak penguin operators contribute to the process @xmath161 .",
    "although the gluonic penguin contributions are of @xmath112 , and hence enhanced with respect to the electroweak penguin contributions which are of @xmath162 , they are suppressed by the @xmath163 rule since they are proportional to @xmath164 .",
    "@xcite the electroweak penguin contributions , on the other hand , although naturally small do not suffer from the @xmath165 suppresion and , furthermore , are enhanced by a factor of @xmath166 .",
    "@xcite as a result , for @xmath0 both penguin operator contributions are of a similar magnitude and , because they enter with opposite sign , they render the theoretical value for this quantity rather uncertain .",
    "this can be appreciated quite nicely from the approximate formula for @xmath0 derived by buras and his collaborators .",
    "@xcite one has @xmath167",
    "\\left(\\frac{110 mev}{m_s(2gev)}\\right)^2 \\times 10^{-4}~.\\ ] ] here @xmath168 and @xmath169 are the matrix elements of the gluonic penguin operator and of the electroweak penguin operator , respectively  normalized so that in the vacuum insertion approximation @xmath170 .",
    "because , as we have seen , @xmath171 , the above formula in this approximation gives @xmath172 , which is much below the value measured by ktev and na48 . indeed , to get agreement with the present world average [ cf eq . ( 20 ) ] , one needs to stretch all the parameters in buras s formula .",
    "namely , one needs to maximize @xmath3 [ @xmath173 $ ] ; decrease the value one assumes for @xmath174 [ perhaps to @xmath175 as low as @xmath176 mev ] ; increase @xmath177 from unity  something which is not clear one can obtain in lattice calculations ,   @xcite but which appears to be true in the chiral quark model  @xcite ; and decrease @xmath178  something which emerges naturally both in lattice and @xmath179 calculations .",
    "@xcite    in this meeting , bertolini  @xcite emphasized that what improves the _ post - dictions _ of @xmath0 is to incorporate in the calculation the trend observed in the chiral quark model and in the @xmath179 approximation that @xmath180 , and not unity as expected in the vacuum insertion approximation .",
    "however , this is just a phenomenological observation and one will not really trust a theoretical result for @xmath181 until the lattice results quantitatively arrive at a value for @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , at the moment , there is considerable controversy on what this value might be .",
    "this was clear from soni s talk  @xcite at bcp3 .",
    "soni  @xcite argued forcefully that the extant lattice calculations for @xmath0 which use staggered fermions are not to be trusted , since they have trouble correctly incorporating the needed counterterms and can not account well for chiral mixing .",
    "however , when one uses domain wall fermions , which have the correct chiral behaviour , one arrives at a result for @xmath0 which is difficult to believe :  @xcite @xmath182_{dwf } = ( -120 \\pm 60 ) \\times 10^{-4}~.\\ ] ] not only is the sign of @xmath0 reversed from what one measures experimentally  due to a large negative contribution from the , so called , `` eye diagrams ''   @xcite  but the overall magnitude is also rather large .    given the theoretical disarray concerning @xmath0 , it appears to me premature to try to invoke the presence of some new physics to @xmath183explain \" the experimental value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , considering new physics with _ correlated _ predictions is interesting . for example , as discussed by masiero  @xcite here , in supersymmetric models with a large @xmath184 phase , not only does one get @xmath0 to be large , but one also predicts largish values for the electron dipole moment and the lepton flavor violating process @xmath185 . as pakvasa  @xcite observed ,",
    "such models also tend to give a rather large cp - violating contribution in @xmath186-decays .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0 , as dambrosio  @xcite discussed in bcp3 , there are rare k - decays where the theoretical prediction are on much firmer ground .",
    "in particular , the `` golden modes '' @xmath187 ( whose branching ratio is proportional to @xmath188 ) and @xmath189 ( whose branching ratio is proportional to @xmath190 ) have theoretical errors of order 1% and 5% , respectively .",
    "the brookhaven experiment bnl e787 has observed one event corresponding to this latter process and one infers a branching ratio  @xcite @xmath191 which is totally consistent with the expectations of the standard model @xmath192 $ ] .",
    "there are strong hopes  @xcite that the proposed bnl experiment e949 will be able to actually pin down a value for @xmath193 , since they expect of order 10 events at the sm level of sensitivity .",
    "clearly , since the branching ratio for @xmath194 is directly proportional to @xmath188 and it has a negligible theoretical error , a measurement of this process would have a significant impact on our knowledge of the ckm matrix .",
    "unfortunately , the decay @xmath195 is extremely challenging experimentally , since one expects a very small branching ratio in the sm @xmath196 $ ] and , further , one has an all neutral final state . nevertheless , as discussed here by hsiung  @xcite",
    "there are a number of proposed experiments in a planning stage , both at brookhaven [ kopio ] , fermilab [ kami ] and kek [ e391 ] .",
    "however , to determine @xmath3 at a significant level ( with error of order @xmath197 ) one needs to measure the @xmath194 branching ratio to an accuracy of order 20% .",
    "this is very hard indeed !    as pakvasa @xcite emphasized in his talk at bcp3 , the theoretical predictions for cp - violation in hyperon decays are likely to have less uncertainty than those for @xmath0 .",
    "however , in hyperon decays , at least in the standard model , the expectations for cp - violating phenomena are very small and appear to be well below the present experimental reach .",
    "@xcite typically , one expects theoretically for @xmath186-decays a cp - violating contribution of order @xmath198 , while experimentally one can reach only a level of order @xmath199 .",
    "the most interesting challenge of the b - factories now entering into operation , and of future collider b experiments , is to try to pin down the angles in the unitarity triangle . as trischuk  @xcite discussed at this meeting for the most favorable mode , involving the decay @xmath200",
    ", one can expect to reach the level @xmath201 at the b - factories , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath202 . to reach this same level of accuracy at the tevatron ,",
    "one probably will need about @xmath203 of integrated luminosity .",
    "these luminosity numbers are likely to be achieved in the next five years .",
    "although the `` uncertainty '' @xmath204 is precisely that which obtains from present day ckm fits ,   @xcite the results on @xmath36 both at the b - factories and at the tevatron will involve an _ actual _ measurement of a cp - violating asymmetry .",
    "thus they are extremely important even if they probably will not significantly improve the knowledge of @xmath36 obtained indirectly through ckm fits .    in the same vein , it is also important to check that the value of @xmath36 measured in a variety of different physical processes is in fact the same . indeed , as remarked by a number of people at this meeting ,  @xcite  @xcite this may well be the best way to look for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "for instance , if there were to be an extra @xmath205 penguin phase @xmath206 , the process @xmath200 would still approximately measure @xmath41 , while the process @xmath207 ( which is penguin dominated ) would measure @xmath208 .",
    "extracting the two other angles in the unitarity triangle , @xmath33 and @xmath31 , from experiment is likely to be much more challenging .",
    "this will require measuring many processes , as sheldon stone  @xcite emphasized in his nice overview at bcp3 .",
    "furthermore , one will need to use , at the same time , theory input rather judiciously .",
    "@xcite  @xcite that this is so can be appreciated in a number of ways .",
    "for example , as is well known ,   @xcite the process @xmath209 does not measure purely @xmath210 since there is likely significant penguin pollution . in principle",
    ", one could imagine estimating these effects by studying @xmath211 .",
    "@xcite however , this decay is estimated to have a @xmath212 , which is too small to make this an effective means to control penguin pollution .",
    "deshpande  @xcite at this meeting suggested what may be a useful alternative .",
    "namely , using a theoretical calculation to extract @xmath33 from the value @xmath213 gotten experimentally from the @xmath214 asymmetry .",
    "the model calculations he presented appeared rather encouraging .",
    "gronau  @xcite discussed , analogously , how theoretical input  in this case the @xmath14 transformation properties of the weak hamiltonian  can be used to constrain @xmath31 for the @xmath158 @xmath215 process .",
    "the piece of the decay amplitude which transforms as the @xmath216 dimensional representation in the tree amplitude essentially fixes the electroweak - penguin amplitude @xmath217 with @xmath218 a calculable number in the standard model . then using that @xmath219 transforms as the 27 representation one can obtain useful interelations among @xmath215 process , from which one can extract @xmath31 .",
    "these techniques can be used also in other contexts and gronau  @xcite estimated that they may lead to a determination of @xmath31 with an error @xmath220 .    obviously , with new data coming in from the b - factories , and soon also from the tevatron",
