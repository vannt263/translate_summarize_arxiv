    "modeling heterogeneous catalytic processes is an essential tool for catalyst design and for the improvement of operating conditions @xcite .",
    "hierarchical approaches have to be adopted due to the need of information on a wide range of length and time scales , from the electronic structure to the reactor design @xcite .",
    "an important step of this approach is the microkinetic modeling , where microscopic processes such as reaction , diffusion , aggregation , and desorption are described by stochastic rules , providing information on the efficiency of the catalytic process in length scales ranging from a few nanometers to several micrometers .",
    "an important problem to be addressed with these methods is the effect of diffusion of reactants through the interface between the catalyst particle and the support .",
    "several recent experimental papers illustrate these phenomena in catalyzed reactions @xcite as well as in related problems , such as gas adsorption @xcite , where the same materials may be used .",
    "morphological features of the catalyst and support and physicochemical conditions of operation determine the role of diffusion on the performance of the process @xcite . sometimes these phenomena are called capture - zone effects , since a certain region of the support surrounding the particle may increase the effective area for capturing reactants from the gas phase , but there are also cases where a net flux to the support is observed .",
    "when only one phase can adsorb the reactant from the gas , the terms spillover ( reactant flux from the catalyst to the support ) or back spillover ( the opposite flow ) are used @xcite , although recently many authors have extended these terms to reactants adsorbing in both phases @xcite ( and here we will use them to facilitate the discussion of the results ) .",
    "due to the large interest in industry , some models which incorporated the effects of reactant diffusion through the catalyst - support interface were designed for certain applications .",
    "the simplest models are based on rate equations ( mean - field models ) that do not account for the spatial heterogeneity of the media where reactions take place @xcite , or that use some type of approximation to represent that heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "other models represent it through distributions of catalytic sites in lattices .",
    "most of them are designed to describe @xmath4 oxidation in different catalysts and conditions @xcite , and simplify diffusion and adsorption processes of some species ( although other applications have also been proposed @xcite ) . in order to get a deeper insight on the effects of reactant diffusion , cwiklik et al @xcite recently simulated simple reaction - diffusion models in surfaces with catalytic stripes and squares , as well as random distributions of catalytic sites . in certain ranges of parameters",
    ", they showed monotonic dependences of the turnover frequency ( tof ) on diffusion coefficients and reaction rates @xcite .",
    "a number of other papers aim at a full investigation of simple models of reaction and diffusion . in the present context ,",
    "relevant examples are models in lattices with distributions of catalytic sites , i. e. with some type of non - homogeneity of catalytic activity @xcite .",
    "even adsorption - desorption models without surface diffusion show that the correlations in catalyst particle position have nontrivial effects on the tof , independently of adsorbate interactions @xcite .",
    "moreover , models including diffusion in heterogeneous surfaces show that the structures that maximize the efficiency of a catalytic process are highly dependent on the rates of the main microscopic processes @xcite .    in the present paper , we will propose a one - dimensional lattice model for unimolecular reactions in a supported catalyst , with reactant diffusion and desorption both in the support and in the catalyst particles .",
    "our aim is to understand the interplay between these physicochemical mechanisms , particle size and catalyst coverage .",
    "the model geometry is equivalent to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , but here we will obtain an analytic solution that facilitates the illustration of different possible outcomes .",
    "we will use scaling concepts to explain the model results , so that this framework can be extended to more complex models and applications to real systems , where numerical solutions are usually necessary . indeed , scaling approaches were already shown to be very useful to understand qualitative trends in reaction - diffusion models @xcite .    among our results , we will distinguish conditions to enhance the net reactant flux from the catalyst to the support or vice - versa by varying one of the microscopic rates , and we will discuss the effect of increasing the catalyst particle size . the increase or decrease of the tof will be shown to depend on the relation between diffusion lengths of reactants in the catalyst and in the support .",
    "some of these results reinforce findings of previous works @xcite .",
    "moreover , under reasonable assumptions for temperature - dependent rates , we will show that a remarkable increase in the tof can be obtained if reverse spillover regularly fills the catalytic particles with the reactants adsorbed in the support .",
    "this feature may be observed in a large temperature range , a possibility which is interesting for applications .",
    "the identification of these scenarios is possible because the model accounts for the inhomogeneity of the catalytic system and , consequently , predicts inhomogeneous distributions of reactants , which advances over the mean - field models .",

    "the particle size is determined by the physico - chemical conditions in which the catalytic material is deposited on the support @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the support covered , @xmath12 , is related to the amount of material used to produce a sample as well as the particle shape , which determines the surface to volume ratio . in oxide supported @xmath13 or @xmath14 catalysts , the particle diameter usually vary from @xmath15 to @xmath16 - depending on the growth conditions and if sintering occurs , sizes of @xmath17 or more can be found .",

    "since reactants are always in contact with the support or the catalyst , this is a surface diffusion model , which is a reasonable assumption on metal particles . on the other hand ,",
    "knudsen diffusion may be more realistic for the movement of reactants inside a catalyst pore .",
    "however , this does not represent a limitation because a suitable value of @xmath26 can be chosen , and interpretations based on diffusion lengths are still valid .",
    "the adopted reaction mechanism for reactant @xmath28 and product @xmath29 is @xmath30 with reaction rate @xmath31 assumed to be uniform in the catalytic region ( this rate corresponds to number of events per site per unit time ) . the unimolecular reaction ( [ reaction ] ) may represent an eley - rideal ( er ) mechanism , in which the adsorbed species reacts with another species @xmath32 arriving from the gas phase and forms a volatile product : @xmath33 for instance , an application to @xmath4 oxidation is discussed in refs .",

    "however , the present assumption is useful for a study which aims at investigating the interplay of many other different physico - chemical processes .",
    "in order to solve the model analytically , we assume that the catalyst particles and the support segments between them are sufficiently large ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , so that a continuous approximation is possible . although @xmath6 and @xmath7 may not be very large in real systems , we will show that the continuous approximation works well even with @xmath6 and @xmath7 of order @xmath36 .",

    "the calculation of unknown constants in equations such as ( [ solthetacat ] ) and ( [ solthetasup ] ) usually follows from the use of suitable boundary conditions .",

    "the one - dimensional structure facilitates the solution , while preserving essential ingredients such as the spatial heterogeneity .",
    "in order to understand the role of the different rates from a scaling approach , we consider the diffusion lengths in the catalyst particle and in the support . if the corresponding region is large enough , the diffusion length measures the typical distance a reactant moves on it before reacting or desorbing . on the other hand",

    "we will consider cases where desorption in the catalytic region is very low , i. e. @xmath80 .",

    "3a we have normalized tof @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "indeed , excluded volume effects limit the adsorption process , which is known to be a relevant effect even in mean - field models @xcite .",
    "the increase of diffusion coefficient improves the catalytic process for high reaction rates , since back spillover effects are dominant as @xmath26 increases .",
    "however , with low reaction rates , the opposite effect is observed : reactants more easily leave the particles as @xmath26 increases , going to the support where they rapidly desorb . in fig .",
    "3a , there is no change in the normalized tof as @xmath26 increases for @xmath92 , which corresponds to @xmath93 .",
    "if other values of the rates and other values of @xmath6 are chosen , the same feature is observed for a different value of @xmath31 , but with the same ratio @xmath94 . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "3b ( @xmath95 ) , that feature is observed when @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the critical ratio @xmath94 which separates regimes of rapid and slow reactions depends only on the fraction of support covered @xmath12 ; above ( below ) the critical ratio , back spillover ( direct spillover ) is dominant .",
    "this result can be interpreted as follows : if the relative increase of diffusion length in the support is larger ( smaller ) than that in the catalyst , then more reactants flow towards the particles ( support ) and the tof increases ( decreases ) .",
    "now we consider the effects of particle size .",
    "we consider changes in @xmath6 with fixed @xmath12 , in order to simulate cases where a fixed amount of catalytic material is deposited on the support , but islands of different sizes are formed . under these conditions , it is important to stress that the size of the gaps between particles ( @xmath7 ) also increases when @xmath6 increases ( eq . [ defrho ] ) .    in figs . 4a and",
    "4b we show the normalized tof as a function of the particle size @xmath6 for two different fractions of the support covered and various reaction rates .",
    "again we observe regimes of high and low reaction rates , corresponding to high and low ratios @xmath94 . for large reaction rates , decreasing @xmath6 is favorable , since @xmath7 also decreases ( @xmath12 is fixed ) and facilitates the back spillover .",
    "on the other hand , for low reaction rates , the conversion is improved by increasing the particle size , since the reactants spend longer times in larger catalytic regions , which compensates the increased desorption in the support . in other words , the loss due to decreasing back spillover is compensated by a gain in decreasing spillover .",
    "the same ratios @xmath94 , which depend on the fraction of support covered @xmath12 , separate the two regimes .    ,",

    "3 and 4 show that the change in one model parameter may increase the tof by a factor near @xmath18 , which is a remarkable change in the efficiency of the catalytic process .    as far as we know , this is the first work that analyzes the conditions for changing the direction of the net reactant flux in the particle - support interface .",
    "the interpretation of results based on diffusion lengths was formerly proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite for models of @xmath4 oxidation in oxide supports .",
    "however , both studies focused on the regime where back spillover is dominant , for instance by assuming infinite diffusion lengths of some species adsorbed in the particles .",
    "that regime was also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite with a mean - field approach that accounts for the different neighborhood of the catalytic sites ( in an approximate form ) . in this case , the approximation is successful because the diffusion lengths are small .",
    "the diffusion coefficient and the reaction and desorption rates are expected to have arrhenius forms as follows : @xmath100    @xmath101    and @xmath102 here , @xmath103 is a frequency and @xmath104 is an activation energy ( @xmath105 ) . assuming that the activation energy for desorption in the catalyst particles is much larger than the other activation energies , we use @xmath106 , which is negligible compared to the other rates in the relevant temperature ranges . for the other activation energies",
    ", we always assume that @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "other reasonable assumptions on the amplitudes of the arrhenius rates facilitate the analysis of the effects of different ranges of energy barriers .",
    "we will consider @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and work with a range of ratios @xmath110 from @xmath36 to @xmath111 .",
    "these relations are reasonable for langmuir - hinshelwood ( lh ) reactions and for @xmath4 adsorption in oxides @xcite , respectively , but we emphasize that these systems are only rough guides to choose working parameters , and may not be viewed as prospective applications - indeed , the unimolecular reaction of our model is representative of er mechanism . in the following ,",
    "we also consider fraction of support covered @xmath84 and @xmath112 ( thus the calculated rates are again ratios to @xmath23 ) .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that each microscopic process will be significantly activated when its rate exceeds the external flux @xmath23 .",
    "however , excluded volume effects lead to surface poisoning when reactions are not frequent ( low temperatures ) , so that other processes can affect the turnover frequency only after reactions are activated .",

    "when the reactions become more frequent ( @xmath116 , i. e. @xmath117 ) , desorption is already activated and diffusion is very fast .",
    "thus spillover and subsequent desorption of reactants does not allow the increase of the turnover frequency .",
    "instead , the tof begins to increase only when @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the negative contribution of spillover is more important when the particles are small , so that a slow increase of the tof is observed . on the other hand , this negative contribution is reduced for large particles , and the maximum tof is rapidly attained by increasing the temperature .",

    "5b illustrates typical conditions in which particle size effects are clearer : desorption in the support has higher activation energy than diffusion and reactions , but activation of a process begins while the other processes are not fully activated , so that the diffusion length @xmath135 can not attain large values before desorption is activated .",

    "however , in the right side of the peaks of fig .",
    "6a , we observe a size dependence because back spillover ceases only when @xmath133 . at high temperatures ,",
    "a size dependence is also noticeable : small particles lose more reactants by spillover than the large ones , and those reactants easily desorb in the support , which leads to smaller tof .    as explained above , the most remarkable effects of particle size",
    "are observed in cases where the activation energies are close to each other .",

    "first we considered the isolated effects of enhancing surface diffusion ( coefficient @xmath26 ) and increasing catalyst particle size @xmath6 . for rapid reactions ,",
    "the increase of any of those quantities favors back spillover and , consequently , increases the turnover frequency .",
    "this regime is separated from that dominated by spillover by a critical value of diffusion length in the catalyst and in the support , which depends only on the fraction of the support surface covered by the catalyst . in the spillover - dominated regime ( slow reactions ) , increasing @xmath26 or @xmath6 slows down the conversion of the reactants .",
    "subsequently , we considered temperature effects by assuming arrhenius dependence of all physico - chemical rates and reasonable values for the amplitudes in those relations . with activation energy for desorption ( @xmath0 ) in the support larger than that for diffusion ( @xmath1 ) , a peak in the turnover frequency as a function of temperature",
    "is observed for small and intermediate values of reaction activation energy @xmath2 , i. e. for cases where @xmath152 .",
    "significant particle size dependence in the peaks is usually observed when the gaps between those energies are small , so that activation of one process occurs while the other ones are not fully activated yet , and the corresponding diffusion lengths rapidly vary with temperature .",
    "the right side of those peaks show size - dependence under more general conditions . for fixed amount of catalytic material deposited on the support , small particle sizes ( with small distance between them )",
    "allow the turnover frequency to attain high peak values due to the beneficial effect of back spillover , while large particles provide low enhancements of catalytic activity .",
    "finally , in the case of slow reactions ( @xmath3 ) , the tof monotonically increases with temperature , and large particle sizes are more efficient to avoid the negative effects of direct spillover .",
    "the aim of the present work is not the quantitative description of a particular catalytic process , but to discuss the interplay of various physico - chemical mechanisms and conditions in systems where spillover is present .",
    "however , it may be useful in the interpretation of some experimental results and motivate the proposal of extended models for their quantitative description .    here",
    "we mention two recent works as examples where the scaling ideas developed above may be relevant .",
    "however , we emphasize the fact that our model can not be directly applied to these systems , thus our results only suggest general guidelines to understand their qualitative behavior . in the first example , piccolo and henry @xcite studied the oxidation of @xmath4 by @xmath153 on @xmath154 and observed a peak in the tof as a function of the temperature .",
    "they found a remarkable increase in the peak height as the particle size was decreased ( even being accompanied by a decrease in the @xmath14 coverage ) , but tiny shifts in the temperature of the maximum .",
    "these results resemble those in figs .",
    "6a , 7a and 7b .",
    "while the size - independent curve shape suggests weak size - dependence of activation energies , the peak height increase suggests that diffusion lengths of reactants were not very large when reactions were activated , so that back spillover ( which increases tof for any type of reaction ) was facilitated with small particles .",
    "thus , differences in activation energies of diffusion , reaction and desorption are probably small , with @xmath0 being larger than the other ones .",
    "the second example is a study of @xmath4 oxidation on @xmath155 on active supports ( i. e. those which adsorb and supply oxygen to the reaction ) , which shows a different trend @xcite : under certain conditions , the tof does not depend on catalyst particle size .",
    "although that reaction involves two species and is probably of lh type , the experimental result suggests that diffusion was highly activated at the working temperature .",
    "in this situation , similarly to our model , diffusion lengths are always very large and the contribution of back spillover does not depend on particle size .    recalling the results of models for ethene and acetylene hydrogenation which incorporate spillover effects is also interesting at this point @xcite . in both systems , the hydrocarbon blocks catalytic sites at high pressures , which leads to a discontinuity of the tof when the external reactant flux towards a catalytic site is of the same order of the microscopic reaction rate . in ethene hydrogenation",
    ", this effect is shown to be more intense with small particles @xcite , leading to finite - size effects",
    ". however , diffusion is weakly activated at the working temperature when compared to the other processes ( the amplitudes of boltzmann factors associated to different processes are very different in that case ) , thus there is no significant effect of diffusion in the tof .",
    "this reinforces the conclusion that the scaling approach proposed here can be extended to interpret more complex reaction models .",
    "this is very important in cases where analytic solutions are not feasible because it may help choosing the conditions to perform simulation work .",
