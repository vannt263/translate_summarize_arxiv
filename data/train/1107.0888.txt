    "<S> , width=302 ]    _ introduction.- _ quantum noise is unavoidably present in any realistic implementation of quantum tasks , ranging from quantum communication protocols @xcite to quantum information processing devices and quantum metrology @xcite . the performance and the optimization of quantum tasks quite often depend on the level of noise which is present in the physical realization considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of great interest to develop experimental methods to estimate the level of noise in the system under examination as precisely as possible . </S>",
    "<S> quantum process tomography ( qpt ) @xcite , which has already been implemented in various experimental realizations @xcite , represents a well - known method to identify an unknown noise , but it lacks the notion of efficiency . in many realistic scenarios , </S>",
    "<S> however , some _ a priori _ information on the kind of noise is available and therefore the problem of measuring it is equivalent to estimate few noise parameters in the most efficient way . this is the context of quantum channel estimation @xcite , which is based on quantum state estimation theory , a merge of statistical estimation theory and quantum physics pioneered by helstrom and holevo @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter is to provide the first genuine experimental application of quantum channel estimation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental realization presented here is based on a quantum optical setup , but it opens new perspectives of applications to a great variety of physical scenarios and quantum technologies , from atomic to solid state systems .    a quantum channel estimation problem is generally formulated as follows . we need to estimate the true value of the @xmath7-dimensional parameter @xmath8 for a given smooth parametric family @xmath9 of noisy quantum channels . </S>",
    "<S> the estimation scheme is twofold : first we prepare a quantum system described by the density operator @xmath10 as input to the channel @xmath9 , then we perform some quantum state measurement on the output state @xmath11 in order to estimate the channel parameters in the most efficient way . thus , the problem is to seek an optimal input @xmath10 for the channel and an optimal measurement on the output state @xmath11 . </S>",

    "<S> the optimal measurement consists of a bell measurement on the two qubits at the channel output , namely the projective measurement @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the outcome probabilities then provide an optimal estimation of the channel parameters @xmath25 .    </S>",
