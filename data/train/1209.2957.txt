    "there are a large number of applications for both natural and designed porous materials including those in fuel cell technology @xcite , physiological transport phenomena @xcite , and heat exchangers @xcite . by natural porous media , we mean structures with random features ; like irregular pores in view of their sizes and shapes as well as their interconnections . on the other extreme",
    ", the term designed porous media @xcite refers to purposefully constructed porous structures where pores are designed to perform functions under certain constraints ; with heat exchanger tube bundles in cross flow as a very good example @xcite .",
    "while porosity can be very high for designed porous materials , natural porous materials typically have much lower values for porosity @xcite .",
    "although it is typically the macroscopic transport properties of either a designed or a natural porous medium in which we are interested , these properties are irrevocably tied to the structure of the medium on a microscopic scale .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the pore - scale geometry , full analytical results at a microscopic scale are nearly impossible , while numerical simulation tends to be highly computationally intensive and require excessive detail .",
    "the approaches of volume averaging @xcite and conditional averaging @xcite provide simplified analytical equations , but these equations remain difficult to associate with the microstructure of the porous medium , especially its connectivity .    a convenient approach that allows at least some of these microscopic properties to be accounted for is pore network modeling , which represents the pore space as a large number of pores connected together by narrow throats with simplified geometry for both . with the use of numerical simulations on networks reconstructed from real - world media , realistic predictive estimates of transport coefficients",
    "have been made @xcite .",
    "however , such reconstruction processes are relatively difficult , and network simulations can be quite computationally intensive for very large numbers of pores .",
    "analytical models with suitable averaging remain highly desirable for the purposes of efficiency and robustness .    unfortunately , there are relatively few analytical approaches to modeling of porous media that take the network microstructure into account .",
    "one such approach is the continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) method @xcite ; however , apart from some recent efforts @xcite , the current ctrw formulation usually requires its key parameter to be fitted to experimental data .",
    "another group of approaches is the effective medium approximations ( emas ) , which can be applied to stochastic networks , replacing them with deterministic ones on the condition that the average of the local fluctuations must be zero .",
    "typically , an effective medium approximation is applied to a regular network structure @xcite , and then transport coefficients are calculated by assuming the existence of a smooth macroscopic field , and calculating local fluxes and hence transport coefficients based on this smooth field assumption ( sfa ) @xcite . in general , effective",
    "medium approximations are reasonably accurate as long as the medium is not near its percolation limit @xcite .",
    "the limitations of standard emas are demonstrated by network structures reconstructed from three - dimensional ( 3d ) imaging of samples of real - world porous media @xcite .",
    "it is clear that regular lattices are not representative of the complex , irregular nature of porous media , and although they can often be tuned in order to match empirical data , the parameters in this tuning are typically just fudge factors . in real - world media ,",
    "the pores and throats vary at macroscopic scales , the throat properties are often anisotropic , and the coordination number exhibits significant variance . some extensions of the effective medium theory have been proposed that deal with one or two of these issues ( anisotropic ema @xcite , effective throat area @xcite , variable coordination number @xcite ) , but an effective medium theory which deals with truly irregular networks of the kind we expect from natural porous media seems to be absent from the literature .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a generalized single - bond ema which does not require a recurring network topology , and can have both anisotropy and large - scale variation .",
    "this is combined with an explicit derivation of the transport equations for the effective medium network , in the form of a diffusion - like partial differential equation .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] describes a general pore - scale model of transport within porous media , in which a porous medium is represented as an irregular pore - throat network which does not conform to any lattice pattern .",
    "pore - scale transport is then modeled using general transport equations based on conservation principles .",
    "section  [ sec : ema ] presents a generalized ema , which is used to account for microscopic variations due to poor connectivity within the medium .",
    "the result of this approximation is a discrete pore network , but one with deterministic throat conductances .",
    "section  [ sec : continuum ] describes the continuum approximation used in order to derive an analytical expression for the transport coefficients in the medium .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows a comparison of the analytical method of sections [ sec : ema ] and [ sec : continuum ] against numerical simulations for randomly generated pore networks .",
    "in order to achieve a tractable representation of a porous medium at the microscopic level , we begin our analysis with a stochastic pore - throat network model , representing the medium as a network of pores connected together by narrow throats .",
    "although the network model we consider is nonetheless a simplification of the structure of real porous media , we avoid many shortcomings of network models by considering a general class of stochastic networks . using a stochastic model",
    "allows for realistic modeling of porous media by only using the important data about the statistical properties of a medium at a microscopic level , such as types and distributions of connections and pores .",
    "the stochastic properties then serve to represent uncertainty about the exact microstructure while taking such information into account . moreover , the types of networks considered are capable of representing porous media with various kinds of irregularity , including macroscopic heterogeneity , significant variation in co - ordination numbers , and anisotropy .    based on a simplification of real media , we consider the pore throats to have negligible storage capacity ( typically volume ) ,",
    "so that accumulation of the transported quantity occurs within the pores .",
    "however , the throats are the primary consideration in determining the throughput within the medium , because overall transport is limited by the constricted nature of the throats . in particular ,",
    "if there were no throats at all , the medium would consist only of isolated pores , and no transport would take place .",
    "as such , transport is primarily modeled within the throats , and at the pore / throat interfaces .",
    "we represent the medium by a network of @xmath0 pores , which we enumerate with integers @xmath1 , where @xmath0 must be large in order for a distinction to emerge between macroscopic and microscopic properties of the medium . a single pore within this network , labeled by its number @xmath2 ,",
    "is then described by its location in @xmath3-dimensional space , @xmath4 , which we take to be the position of its center , and a vector of additional properties @xmath5 ( e.g. pore volume ) . for our purposes , we combine the physical coordinates and the additional properties into the extended vector @xmath6 taking values in some vector space @xmath7 , which we will call `` extended space '' .    in order to describe the statistical uncertainty that is inherent in modeling the complex and disordered structure of a porous medium , the extended coordinate vectors are considered to be random variables @xmath8 , corresponding to the positions and properties of pores sampled from the medium without replacement . as such",
    ", any individual @xmath9 has an identical marginal pdf ( probability density function ) , @xmath10 . for notational convenience , whenever the random variables considered are evident from the arguments , the subscripts will be dropped - e.g. @xmath11 for the single - pore distribution .    throughout this network , there are throats connecting pairs of pores - these are thin links through which transport between pores can occur . in general , like the pores",
    ", these throats could have various properties associated with them .",
    "however , for the purposes of the pore - throat network model , these properties are combined into a single value which we call the conductance of the throat , by analogy to electric circuits . for two pores @xmath2 and @xmath12 the conductance of a throat connecting them is the value @xmath13 , which describes the ease of transport through the throat - a value of @xmath14 would mean there is no direct link , while a value of @xmath15 would effectively combine the two pores into a single pore .",
    "moreover , we do not consider the conductance of an individual throat to depend upon the direction of transport , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "as with the pores , we consider this conductance to be a stochastic variable , @xmath17 , since individual throats in the network could have a variety of values for conductance .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this conductance depends primarily on the properties of the throat itself , and on the pore - throat interfaces on either side . of course",
    ", we can expect correlation between the throat and pore properties - for example , larger pores would generally have larger throats . with this in mind , we express the distribution for conductances for any given throat by @xmath18 which accounts for the effect of pore properties and locations on the throat conductance , as well as for independent randomness within the throats themselves .",
    "it is important to note that throat length is also accounted for in this representation , since the physical coordinates of the pores are included in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in a realistic porous medium ,",
    "it is clear that the vast majority of pairs of pores do not have any throat connecting them at all , especially when the pores are spatially distant . considering this",
    ", we let @xmath21 be the probability that a throat between pores with extended coordinates @xmath22 is present , and so the conductance distribution for the throat can be written as @xmath23 \\delta ( g ) , \\label{eq : dist_g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the distribution over nonzero values of conductance ( i.e. conditional upon @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 is the dirac delta function .",
    "this stochastic network model is a very general type of random graph , with the addition of random edge weights - the conductance values representing the transport properties of the throats . of the many classes of random graph studied in the literature ,",
    "the closest well - known one is the random geometric graph ( rgg ) @xcite due to the spatial nature of the node parameters and localized connectivity .",
    "another approach is fitness - based connectivity @xcite , but this concept is targeted towards the generation of scale - free networks and hence is not used here .    having defined the throat conductance , we can derive a general transport equation valid for a variety of different transport phenomena , including diffusion , conduction heat transfer , flow of electrical current , transport across biological membranes , and linear cases of fluid flow ( e.g. incompressible newtonian stokes flow ) .",
    "we consider inter - pore transport to be driven by a `` potential difference '' between two pores , while the transport phenomenon represents the tendency for these potentials to equilibrate .    in this paper",
    ", we will use the terminology of molecular diffusion , and so we identify the potential of a pore as the concentration of the substance within the pore , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the amount of the substance in the pore , and @xmath29 is the volume of the pore . there is a net flow of particles from pores with higher concentrations to those with lower concentrations , resulting in a flow rate through any given throat ( from pore @xmath2 to pore @xmath12 ) defined by @xmath30 with the use of a conservation law within the @xmath2-th pore , we can finally derive the _ master equation _ , @xmath31 which is a system of @xmath0 differential equations that describes transport within the medium at the pore scale . as noted previously ,",
    "this equation is applicable to a wide range of transport processes ; expressions for throat conductance @xmath32 in terms of the geometric properties of the throat and the properties of the materials or substances involved are given in appendix  [ app : trans ] for several of these transport phenomena .",
    "if the porous medium is very well - connected , global transport can be directly approximated using the continuum approximation described in section  [ sec : continuum ] using the mean or expected value for the conductance of each throat , @xmath33 however , in general , the media we consider do not meet this requirement . in order to resolve this",
    ", we apply a nonuniform effective medium approximation that transforms networks with intermittent throats or significant variations in conductance into well - connected ones .",
    "the importance of connectedness within a pore network is highlighted by many results in the area of percolation theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , a very general result for such systems is that in the limit @xmath34 , there is a critical level of connectedness for the system which is called the `` percolation threshold '' - below this level , the overall network collapses into small , disjoint clusters , and hence there is no transport at the macroscopic level @xcite .    in general",
    ", it is extremely difficult to derive the percolation threshold , or transport behavior in the vicinity of the threshold , for all but the simplest of network structures .",
    "this is especially pertinent to the proposed network model , since it has an irregular structure and correlations between the pores and throats .",
    "however , a simple analysis of the proposed model can identify some important structural properties . using @xmath35 , the probability that a throat is present",
    ", we can derive the expected coordination number of a pore with extended coordinates @xmath36 as @xcite @xmath37    the value of @xmath38 is crucial to overall transport in the medium - if this value is high , the network is well - connected and using the mean conductance for every bond should prove to be a reasonable approximation . unlike with @xmath0 , we can not simply assume that @xmath38 is large - pore networks extracted from 3d images of various porous media @xcite have usually had average coordination numbers between 2 and 7 .    to illustrate the effects of low values of @xmath38 ,",
    "consider the simple case of a regular lattice pattern , in which every throat independently has probability @xmath39 of being present ( @xmath40 ) and probability @xmath41 of being absent ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "using a single - bond ema , kirkpatrick @xcite has shown that the global transport properties of such a network are roughly the same as those of an identical lattice pattern in which every throat is present , with conductance is the mean coordination number of the stochastic network , while kirkpatrick s @xmath38 is equivalent to our @xmath43 . in this simple example @xmath44 . ] @xmath45 as @xmath46 or @xmath47 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_simp ] ) approaches the mean value approximation , @xmath48 .",
    "however , in cases where @xmath39 and @xmath38 are small , it is clear that the mean value approximation is wrong by a significant margin , and hence a better approximation is required .",
    "unfortunately , in general , single - bond ema can not account for behavior near the percolation threshold of the system , because of a failure to account for the effects of correlations between the throats in the system @xcite - in the terminology of percolation theory , the correlation length of the system diverges at the threshold @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the accuracy of ema tends to be quite good for systems that are not in the vicinity of their percolation thresholds @xcite . for the treatment of cases where @xmath38 is small , with significant stochastic variation in the throats ( especially when",
    "there is a high probability of absence ) , we apply a generalization of single - bond ema in which the bond conductances are not uniform , but instead vary depending on the extended coordinates of the pores they connect .",
    "the result of this approach is the transforming the probabilistic conductances @xmath13 into deterministic effective values @xmath49 .    unlike kirkpatrick s approach for the regular lattice",
    ", we do not consider the effective conductance to be equal for every throat ; instead , we account for the dependence of a throat s properties on the properties and locations of the pores it connects .",
    "consequently , we solve for an an unknown function @xmath50 - effective throat conductance as a function of pore locations and attributes , creating an effective medium which is heterogeneous and anisotropic in nature .",
    "note that the resulting effective medium is continuous in some sense - the pores are effectively smeared out over their distributions , and the throat conductances are described by a function @xmath51 .",
    "although for regular lattices the effective medium can have low average coordination numbers , the randomness in pore properties and locations in the proposed model means that in our case the effective medium must usually have both large @xmath0 and a large coordination number @xmath43 in order to properly eliminate the local fluctuations in the original network . in terms of the original network ,",
    "the value @xmath43 is the number of pores in what we call the _ locale _ of pore @xmath2 - that is , the region of the medium to which pore @xmath2 can ( with nonzero probability ) have direct connections . fortunately , the structure of real world porous media is generally in line with this assumption - direct connections tend to occur only between nearby pores , but there are generally many other pores in the vicinity of any given pore .    in order for the approximation proposed in this paper to be valid , the overall statistical properties of the medium ( i.e. the distributions @xmath11 and @xmath52 ) must not change significantly within a single locale .",
    "this type of assumption is typically almost inevitable in the derivation of a continuum model , although here it is only required on relatively small scales and so we can still account for macroscopic heterogeneity such as spatial variation in composition , structure or porosity .",
    "aspects of the pores such as pore size can also be included in these statistical properties , but it is important to note that in such a case the locale consists of pores of varying sizes , and sharp changes in throat statistics between connected pores are allowed only with negligible frequency . in real - world porous media with fractal properties ( coal may serve as a notable example ) this type of approach should be entirely reasonable @xcite ; in such cases , we expect transport to occur via a cascade process in which flow between large pores and much smaller ones occurs primarily via pores of intermediate size .",
    "the self - consistent condition of effective medium theory states that the fluctuations over a section of the original stochastic network , compared to its replacement in the effective medium , must average to zero . in our case",
    ", we consider this condition when applied to a single throat within the network connecting pores with extended coordinates taking the fixed values @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; analogously to kirkpatrick @xcite , we express this condition as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the expected two - point conductance between pores at positions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in the absence of a throat directly connecting them - this is the net flow through the network resulting from externally forcing a unit difference in concentration between those pores .",
    "this two - point conductance is usually defined in terms of green s functions @xcite ; a detailed discussion with exact values for many infinite regular lattices can be seen in @xcite . this equation allows the throat conductance to vary with the locations of the pores and the orientation and length of the throat , resulting in a heterogeneous and anisotropic effective medium . with this in mind , we term this approach the _ nonuniform effective medium approximation _",
    "( nema ) . in its most general form ,",
    "( [ eq : ema ] ) is very difficult to solve , since the values for @xmath55 between any two pores depends on every other throat in the effective medium , and consequently on the values of the function @xmath51 , while @xmath51 in turn depends upon @xmath55 .",
    "however , under certain conditions , we can derive approximations for @xmath51 and @xmath55 which make the problem much more tractable .",
    "as long as almost all bonds in the original network have a very low probability of being present , @xmath56 , which naturally results in @xmath57 and consequently ( as needed ) a well - connected effective medium , we can approximate @xmath51 by @xmath58 for natural porous media , the assumption of @xmath56 should prove to be a reasonable one , as there tend to be many pores in the vicinity of any given pore , but relatively few of these tend to be directly connected . for the details of the derivation of eq .",

    "it is clear that as long as an expression for the unknown function @xmath54 can be determined , eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_approx ] ) specifies the values of the conductances in the effective medium .",
    "fortunately , the value of @xmath55 is only important within a pore s locale , since long throats should be very unlikely and have very low conductances , resulting in negligible values of @xmath51 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_approx ] ) regardless of @xmath55 . since the effective medium must have a large coordination number",
    ", we can see that in general @xmath59 and so the presence or absence of a direct connection is insignificant for calculating @xmath55 .    to approximate the conductance between pore @xmath2 and",
    "pore @xmath12 , we consider it to consist of three conductances in series - two input conductances from the pores into their locales , which we represent by the unknown function @xmath60 , and a third term which comes from the interconnection between these locales .    for neighboring pores",
    ", we expect that in a porous medium the locales of these pores should overlap significantly , of the volume of either sphere . ]",
    "resulting in @xmath61 connections to one another , causing the third term to be negligible in comparison with the input conductances .",

    "applying the ema described in the previous section accounts for the stochastic variation in throat conductances in the original network .",
    "however , this still leaves a system with an equation for each individual pore , i.e. @xmath73 which is merely the master equation @xmath74 but applied to the effective medium rather than to the original random network . in order to simplify this equation",
    ", we wish to transform it into a continuous form , wherein the amount of substance @xmath75 and concentration @xmath76 are considered over the extended space rather than within individual pores .",
    "this is achieved by considering the ensemble of realizations of the pore positions and properties in the effective medium , and then converting to continuous form by taking the limit of a summation over discrete regions .",

    "it can be seen that this equation takes a form very similar to the fokker - planck ( kolmogorov forward ) equation , which governs the pdf of an it - type random walk .",

    "three characteristic types are considered for the distribution of nonzero conductances within the medium :    * a single , discrete value ( section  [ sec : svd ] ) . * a continuous distribution of conductances ( section  [ sec : diid ] ) . for comparison",
