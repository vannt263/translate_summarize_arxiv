    "due to its particular mass of @xmath4 , the @xmath1 lepton constitutes an excellent system to study qcd at low energies , as in about 65% of all cases it decays into hadrons , while the qcd description remains largely perturbative . in the seminal work @xcite , the framework for a precise determination of the qcd coupling @xmath0 from the total @xmath1 hadronic width @xmath5 } { \\gamma[\\tau^- \\to e^- \\overline \\nu_e \\nu_\\tau ( \\gamma ) ] } \\,=\\ , 3.640(10 ) \\,,\\ ] ]",
    "was developed , while afterwards invariant mass distributions were incorporated into the analysis as well @xcite .",
    "the most recent study of the aleph spectral function data on the basis of the final full lep data set yielded @xmath6 @xcite , which after evolution to the @xmath7-boson mass scale results in @xmath8 .",
    "the dominant quantifiable theory uncertainty resides in as yet uncalculated higher - order qcd corrections and improvements of the perturbative series through renormalisation group ( rg ) methods .",
    "most suitable for the @xmath0 determination is the @xmath1 decay rate into light @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks @xmath11 via a vector or axialvector current , since in this case power corrections are especially suppressed .",
    "theoretically , @xmath11 takes the form @xcite @xmath12\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite are electroweak corrections , @xmath15 comprises the perturbative qcd correction , and the @xmath16 denote quark mass and higher @xmath17-dimensional operator corrections which arise in the framework of the operator product expansion ( ope ) .    when computing the total @xmath1 hadronic width a phase - space integral over the physical spectrum has to be calculated , which by analyticity can be related to a contour integral over qcd correlators in the complex @xmath18-plane , where @xmath18 is the invariant mass of the final state hadronic system .",
    "as we also intend to rg improve the perturbative series , the questions arises if the rg resummation should be performed before or after evaluating the contour integral ? if the `` true '' all - order result were available , both treatments should agree , but to any finite order in perturbation theory , significant differences may arise .    the approach of first rg - improving the correlators and then performing the contour integral was introduced in @xcite and termed contour - improved perturbation theory ( cipt ) , as unarguably large running effects of @xmath19 along the contour are resummed .",
    "however , it is known that the qcd series is divergent , being asymptotic at best .",
    "hence , also the explicit expansion coefficients of the perturbative series are bound to become large .",
    "if cancellations between explicit coefficients and running effects occur , just resumming the running effects may not lead to a good approximation , but it could be better to perform a consistent expansion in powers of @xmath20 , being called fixed - order perturbation theory ( fopt ) .",
    "while it can be demonstrated that , as expected , cipt is a good approximation , and cipt as well as fopt are compatible , when the running effects dominate @xcite , in the large-@xmath21 approximation , in which @xmath15 is exactly calculable , fopt gives a better approximation to the true result and cipt is not seen to be compatible with it @xcite .",
    "thus it is not a priori clear which behaviour prevails in real qcd .",
    "it should be obvious that this is a question about perturbative orders beyond the presently known @xmath22 term @xcite .    to further investigate the difference between cipt and fopt ,",
    "the contribution of higher perturbative orders has to be modelled .",
    "this then allows to investigate the following questions :    * are fo and ci perturbation theory found to be compatible , once terms beyond the currently known perturbative coefficients of the series for @xmath15 are included ? * how do fo and ci perturbation theory at a particular order compare to the true result for @xmath15 , and is the closest approach to the true result related to the minimal terms in the respective series ? * and finally , which of the two methods , fopt or cipt provides the closer approach to the true value at order @xmath22 , and in general ?",
    "the working assumption in all this is that the `` true '' result is approximated with reasonable accuracy by the borel sum of the model series under consideration , since the power corrections to @xmath23 are known to be small .",
    "the model employed below will be constructed such as to incorporate the general structure of the adler function in the borel plane , dictated by the ope and the rg .",
    "in the following , we shall only be concerned with the purely perturbative correction @xmath15 which gives the dominant contribution to @xmath11 . in fopt",
    "it takes the general form @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the coefficients which appear in the perturbative expansion of the vector correlation function , @xmath27 at each perturbative order , the coefficients @xmath28 can be considered independent , while all other @xmath26 with @xmath29 are calculable from the rg equation .",
    "further details can for example be found in ref .",
    "finally , the @xmath30 are contour integrals which are defined by @xmath31 the first three which are required up to @xmath32 take the numerical values @xmath33    at order @xmath34 fopt contains unsummed logarithms of order @xmath35 with @xmath36 related to the contour integrals @xmath30 .",
    "cipt sums these logarithms , which yields @xmath37 in terms of the contour integrals @xmath38 over the running coupling , defined as : @xmath39 in contrast to fopt , for cipt each order @xmath40 just depends on the corresponding coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "thus , all contributions proportional to the coefficient @xmath28 which in fopt appear at all perturbative orders equal or greater than @xmath40 are resummed into a single term .",
    "numerically , the two approaches lead to significant differences . using @xmath41 in eqs .",
    "( [ del0fo ] ) and ( [ del0ci ] ) , one finds @xmath42 where the first number in both cases employs the known coefficients up to @xmath43 @xcite and the numbers in brackets include an estimate of the @xmath44 term with @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "inspecting the individual contributions from each order , up to @xmath44 the cipt series appears to be better convergent .",
    "however , around the seventh order , the contour integrals @xmath38 change sign and thus at this order the contributions are bound to become small . therefore",
    ", the faster approach to the minimal term does not necessarily imply that cipt gives the closer approach to the true result for the resummed series .",
    "to clarify whether fopt or cipt results in a better approximation to @xmath15 , one needs to construct a physically motivated model for its series .",
    "the corresponding model will be based on the borel transform of the adler function @xmath46 : @xmath47 \\,.\\ ] ] in the following discussion it is slightly more convenient to utilise the related function @xmath48 .",
    "its borel transform @xmath49(t)$ ] is defined by the relation @xmath50(t)\\,.\\ ] ] the integral @xmath51 , if it exists , gives the borel sum of the original divergent series .",
    "it was found that the borel - transformed adler function @xmath49(t)$ ] obtains infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalon poles at positive and negative integer values of the variable @xmath52 , respectively @xcite .",
    "( with the exception of @xmath53 . )",
    "apart from very low orders , where a dominance of renormalon poles close to @xmath54 has not yet set in , intermediate orders should be dominated by the leading ir renormalon poles , while the leading uv renormalon , being closest to @xmath54 , dictates the large - order behaviour of the perturbative expansion .",
    "assuming that only the first two orders are not yet dominated by the lowest ir renormalons , one is led to the ansatz @xmath55(u ) & \\!\\!=\\!\\ ! & b[{\\widehat}d_1^{\\rm uv}](u ) + b[{\\widehat}d_2^{\\rm ir}](u ) + { \\nonumber}\\\\ { \\vbox{\\vskip 4 mm } } & & b[{\\widehat}d_3^{\\rm ir}](u ) + d_0^{\\rm po } + d_1^{\\rm po } u \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which includes one uv renormalon at @xmath56 , the two leading ir renormalons at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , as well as polynomial terms for the two lowest perturbative orders .",
    "explicit expressions for the uv and ir renormalon pole terms @xmath59(u)$ ] and @xmath60(u)$ ] can be found in section  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "apart from the residues @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the full structure of the renormalon pole terms is dictated by the ope and the rg .",
    "therefore , the model  ( [ bru ] ) depends on five parameters , the three residua @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as well as the two polynomial parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "these parameters can be fixed by matching to the perturbative expansion of @xmath48 up to @xmath44 .",
    "thereby one also makes use of the estimate for @xmath68 .",
    "the parameters of the model ( [ bru ] ) are then found to be : @xmath69\\ ] ] @xmath70 the fact that the parameter @xmath67 turns out to be small implies that the coefficient @xmath71 is already reasonably well described by the renormalon pole contribution , although it was not used to fix the residua .",
    "therefore , one could set @xmath72 and actually work with a model which only has four parameters .",
    "the predicted value @xmath73 in this model turns out very close to the estimate , which can be viewed as one test of the stability of the model .",
    "( full circles ) at @xmath41 , employing the model ( [ bru ] ) , as a function of the order @xmath40 up to which the terms in the perturbative series have been summed .",
    "the straight line represents the result for the borel sum of the series.[figadler],width=294 ]    a graphical account of the model ( [ bru ] ) for the ( reduced ) adler function @xmath74 is displayed in figure  [ figadler ] .",
    "the full circles denote the partial sums of the perturbative series up to order @xmath40 .",
    "the minimal term of the series at the 5th order is marked by a grey diamond .",
    "the perturbative results are compared with the borel sum of the model ( straight line ) .",
    "generally , figure  [ figadler ] shows that the model is well - behaved : the series goes through a number of small terms such that the truncated series nicely agrees with its borel sum , before the sign - alternating asymptotic behaviour takes over around @xmath75 .",
    "( full circles ) and @xmath76 ( grey circles ) at @xmath41 , employing the model ( [ bru ] ) , as a function of the order @xmath40 up to which the terms in the perturbative series have been summed .",
    "the straight line represents the result for the borel sum of the series.[fig6],width=294 ]    the implications of the model ( [ bru ] ) for @xmath15 in fopt and cipt is graphically represented in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the full circles denote the result for @xmath77 and the grey circles the one for @xmath76 , as a function of the order @xmath40 up to which the perturbative series has been summed .",
    "the straight line corresponds to the principal value borel sum of the series , @xmath78 , and the shaded band provides an error estimate based on the imaginary part divided by @xmath79 .",
    "the order at which the series have their smallest terms is indicated by the grey diamonds .",
    "as is obvious from figure  [ fig6 ] , like for the adler function itself , fopt displays the behaviour expected from an asymptotic series : the terms decrease up to a certain order around which the closest approach to the resummed result is found , and for even higher orders , the divergent large - order behaviour of the series sets in . for cipt , on the other hand , the asymptotic behaviour sets in earlier , and the series is never able to come close to the borel sum .",
    "the finding that in the model ( [ bru ] ) cipt misses the full borel sum can be traced back to the fact that in cipt the running effects along the complex contour are resummed to all orders , while explicit contributions of the @xmath28 at a certain order are dropped . however , being an asymptotic series , also the adler function coefficients @xmath28 become large , and cancellations between the explicit contributions and the running effects take place . as was shown in section  4 of @xcite , in the large-@xmath21 approximation , for @xmath23 the leading ir renormalon cancels completely , and also the large - order divergence of the series",
    "is softened .",
    "even though in real qcd the leading ir does not anymore cancel completely , for @xmath23 it is still suppressed by a factor @xmath80 , and furthermore a sign - alternating uv renormalon component does not yet show up in the known coefficients .",
    "thus , the cancellations between running effects and explicit coefficients are also expected to prevail in full qcd .",
    "the deficiency of cipt to approach the borel sum of the series , which leads to the marked differences of @xmath77 and @xmath76 , can also be observed when the adler function is inspected along the complex circle .",
    "this is discussed in detail in appendix  b of ref .",
    "while fopt converges to the borel sum on the full circle ( though rather badly close to the minkowskian axis ) , in some regions of the circle cipt largely differs from the resummed result , again due to the missed cancellations .    as the behaviour of cipt",
    "versus fopt hinges on the contribution of the leading ir renormalon at @xmath57 , in principal also models can be constructed for which cipt provides a good account of the borel sum .",
    "these would generally be models where @xmath64 is much smaller than the value quoted in eq .",
    "( [ duvirb ] ) . while such models can at present not be excluded , the pattern of the individual contributions appears more unnatural than in the model ( [ bru ] ) : the known @xmath28 can only be reproduced when one allows for large cancellations between the individual terms .",
    "thus , the behaviour generally expected from the presence of renormalon poles , namely dominance of leading ir poles at intermediate orders , would be lost .",
    "the starting point for a determination of @xmath0 from hadronic @xmath1 decays is eq .",
    "( [ rtauva ] ) for the decay rate of the @xmath1 lepton into light @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks .",
    "the analysis will be based on fopt together with the ansatz ( [ bru ] ) for higher - order terms discussed in the last section . due to the observation that cipt is not able to approach the resummed series",
    ", it will not be employed below .",
    "the first step of the @xmath0 analysis consists in estimating the values of the power corrections @xmath81 , which arise from higher - dimensional operators in the framework of the ope .",
    "given these estimates and experimental data , a phenomenological value of @xmath15 can be calculated using eq .",
    "( [ rtauva ] ) .",
    "this allows to determine the value of @xmath20 by requiring that the theoretical value @xmath77 matches the phenomenological value @xmath82 .",
    "errors are estimated by varying all parameters within their uncertainties .    in view of the smallness of the light quark masses @xmath83 and",
    "@xmath84 , as well as the suppression of the dimension-4 contribution in @xmath23 , the dominant power correction arises from the six dimensional 4-quark condensates . as the number of contributing operators is too large to treat the 4-quark condensates individually , conventionally the so - called vacuum - saturation approximation ( vsa ) @xcite is employed .",
    "then the corresponding contribution takes the form @xmath85 where for the numerical estimate the required quark condensate is taken from the gmor relation @xcite , and @xmath86 was assumed to take into account violations of the vsa .",
    "this choice includes most estimates of the four - quark condensate present in the literature .    to complete the estimate of power corrections to @xmath23 , the longitudinal contribution which arises from the pseudoscalar correlator still has to be included . , is completely negligible . ] because the perturbative series for this correlator does not converge very well , the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite will be followed .",
    "the main idea is to replace the qcd expression for the pseudoscalar correlator by a phenomenological representation .",
    "the dominant contribution to the pseudoscalar spectral function stems from the well - known pion pole , giving @xmath87 plus small corrections from higher - excited pionic resonances . repeating the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite and updating the input parameters , one finds @xmath88 collecting all contributions , and adding the errors in quadrature , one arrives at the total estimate of all power corrections : @xmath89 the value ( [ delph ] ) is consistent with the most recent fit to the @xmath1 spectral functions performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a matter of principle",
    ", the ope of correlation functions in the complex @xmath18-plane could be inflicted with so - called `` duality violations '' @xcite .",
    "these arise from the contour integral close to the physical region which even though suppressed in @xmath23 could be sizeable @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , before a possible additional duality violating contribution can be extracted consistently from a combined fit to spectral moments , it shall be omitted .    employing the value @xmath90 , which results from eq .",
    "( [ rtauex ] ) in conjunction with @xmath91 @xcite , as well as @xmath92 @xcite , from eqs .",
    "( [ rtauva ] ) and ( [ delph ] ) the phenomenological value for @xmath15 can be derived : @xmath93 the dominant experimental uncertainty in ( [ de0ph ] ) is due to @xmath94 and the theoretical one to the dimension-6 condensate .",
    "the final step in the extraction of @xmath20 now consists in finding the values of @xmath0 for which @xmath82 matches the theoretical prediction , which yields @xcite @xmath95 evolving this result to the @xmath7-boson mass scale finally leads to @xmath96 in perfect agreement with the world average @xcite .",
