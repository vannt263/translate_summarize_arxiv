    "`` quarks in hadrons and nuclei '' is the title of this school . due to the overwhelming success of perturbative qcd for hadronic reactions at high energies",
    "we are all convinced that qcd is the correct theory of strong interactions and that all hadrons are made of quarks and the particles gluing them together , the gluons . as , however , no quarks and gluons have been seen in detectors we need the hypothesis of confinement in order to rescue the success of qcd . over the last decades",
    "there have been many attempts to prove confinement from qcd . despite these efforts",
    "it is fair to say that the phenomenon of confinement is still little understood : a clear and undisputable mechanism responsible for this effect has not been found yet .",
    "furthermore , we may even face the challenge that nowadays formulation of quantum field theory is not sufficient to tackle this problem successfully : it seems not even clear , at present , whether the phenomenon of confinement is at all compatible with a description of quark and gluon correlations in terms of local fields .",
    "on the other hand , there is a number of criteria which signal unambigously the occurrence of confinement .",
    "one line of research starts from the expectation that the two - point correlation functions of qcd , the quark , gluon and ghost propagators , are likely to provide some clues to the underlying structures of the theory which are responsible for confinement . and indeed , it has been argued @xcite that in faddeev ",
    "popov quantized landau gauge qcd the infrared behaviour of the ghost propagator is related to both , the kugo  ojima confinement criterium @xcite and the gribov  zwanziger horizon condition @xcite .    according to kugo and ojima @xcite a physical state space that only contains colourless states is generated , if two conditions are fulfilled : first , one should not have massless particle poles in transverse gluon correlations and , second , one needs well - defined , i.e.  unbroken , global colour charges . the second condition can be related to the behaviour of the ghost propagator in landau gauge . for it to be satisfied , the propagator must be more singular than a massless particle pole in the infrared @xcite .",
    "gribov s horizon condition is connected to the gauge fixing ambiguities in the linear covariant gauge @xcite .",
    "ideally one would eliminate gribov copies along gauge orbits by a restriction of the functional integral of the qcd partition function to the so - called fundamental modular region .",
    "this part of configuration space lies inside the first gribov region , a convex region in gauge field space which contains the trivial configuration @xmath1 . at the boundary of the first gribov region , the lowest eigenvalue of the faddeev ",
    "popov operator approaches zero .",
    "entropy arguments have been employed to reason that the infrared modes of the gauge field are close to this gribov horizon @xcite . as the ghost propagator is the inverse of the fadeev ",
    "popov operator we therefore encounter the presence of the gribov horizon in the infrared behaviour of the ghost : the ghost propagator is required to be more singular than a simple pole if the restriction to the gribov region is correctly implemented . furthermore , by the same entropy arguments , the gluon propagator has to vanish in the infrared @xcite .    there is an interesting point to note in this context : employing _ stochastic quantiziation _ instead of the faddeev ",
    "popov formalism avoids the faddeev ",
    "popov determinant and thus the gribov problem completely .",
    "the faddeev  popov ghosts being absent the above picture seems to be impossible to be realized .",
    "nevertheless one finds essentially the same infrared behaviour for the propagator of the transverse gluons whereas the longitudinal gluons ( which are absent in faddeev  popov ",
    "landau gauge ) take over the role of the ghosts @xcite .",
    "therefore the following generic picture in covariant gauges seems likely : negative metric states like ghosts and/or longitudinal gluons are long - ranged whereas the propagator for transverse gluons vanishes for long distances .",
    "thus there is compelling evidence that an infrared enhanced propagator for ghosts ( or longitudinal gluons ) leads to an infrared vanishing ( or , at least , infrared finite ) tranverse gluon propagator .",
    "such a gluon propagator leads to violation of positivity in the spectral function for transverse gluons ( see e.g.  chapter 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) and thus describes confined transverse gluons . speaking somewhat sloppily : in landau gauge qcd",
    "the gluons are confined by the faddeev ",
    "popov ghosts which are the long - range correlations of the theory .",
    "as we have argued that confinement in covariant gauges is correlated with infrared singularities we have the need for a continuum - based non - perturbative method .",
    "the framework we have chosen to investigate the behaviour of the propagators of qcd are the dyson ",
    "schwinger equations ( dses ) for the qcd propagators , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( for recent reviews see e.g.   refs.@xcite ) . being complementary to lattice monte carlo simulations which have to deal with finite - volume effects , dses allow for analytical investigations of the infrared behaviour of correlation functions .",
    "in landau gauge we have the particularly simple situation that the ghost - gluon vertex does not suffer from ultraviolet infinities . based on this observation one can use the general structure of the ghost dse , the properties of multiplicative renormalizability and the assumption that all involved green s functions can be expanded in a power series to show that the kugo  ojima criterion as well as the gribov  zwanziger horizon condition are satisfied @xcite . furthermore",
    ", it has been shown that the infrared behaviour of the ghost and the gluon propagators are uniquely related : defining ghost and gluon renormalization functions , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , from the propagators @xmath4 and @xmath5 , one obtains : @xmath6 in addition , the inequality @xmath7 has been proven @xcite .",
    "the corresponding gluon propagator is thus infrared vanishing or , at least , infrared finite .",
    "a further interesting consequence is the fact that the corresponding powers in the running coupling ( as extracted from the ghost - gluon vertex ) exactly cancel and one obtains an infrared fixed point for the coupling , see the next section .",
    "as we have seen we can deduce the qualitative infrared behaviour of qcd propagators applying only general principles . to obtain detailed information on the propagators of landau gauge qcd from the dses",
    "they have to be truncated , and , even more severe , _ anstze _ for the vertices have to be made .",
    "the resulting closed system of equations can be solved both , analytically in the infrared and numerically for non - vanishing momenta .",
    "the considerations presented in the previous section suggest that for small momenta the ghost loop dominates in the gluon dse . assuming this dominance ,",
    "effects from a wide class of possible dressings for the ghost - gluon vertex have been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite and found to be of negligible influence to the qualitative findings .",
    "thus , for the purpose of this talk we concentrate on the simplest of these truncation schemes which has been developed in detail in refs .",
    "this scheme employs bare three - point functions and neglects four - gluon vertices .",
    "in addition , as confinement is expected to be present in the pure yang ",
    "mills sector of qcd we will couple in the quarks at a later stage .    a coupled system of gluon and ghost dses has been studied for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this investigation",
    "the three - point functions have been modeled such that the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities have been fulfilled to high degree of accuracy . on the other hand , technical simplifications like approximating",
    "the angular integrals in the dses had to be employed .",
    "a study beyond landau gauge is given in ref .",
    "there it is shown that the diagrams involving four - gluon vertices can not be neglected in the analytical extraction of the infrared behaviour of the gluon and ghost propagators in the so - called curci ",
    "ferrari gauges if bare vertex functions are used . as a side result it has been shown that in linear covariant gauges the assumption of infrared dominance of the ghost loop is , at least , self - consistent .",
    "the truncation scheme of refs .",
    "@xcite provides the correct one - loop anomalous dimensions of the ghost and gluon dressing functions , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , respectively , and thus correctly describes the leading logarithmic behaviour of the propagators in the ultraviolet .",
    "furthermore , this scheme reproduces the infrared exponents found in refs.@xcite : @xmath8 these exponents are close to the ones extracted from lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough they are also close to the ones obtained in a comparable truncation scheme in stochastically quantized landau gauge yang  mills theory for the transverse and the longitudinal gluons @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] the numerical solutions for the gluon and ghost dressing functions for the colour group su(2 ) are compared to those obtained from recent lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "differences mainly occur for the gluon dressing function in the region around its maximum , i.e.  somewhat below one gev .",
    "these can be attributed to the omission of the two - loop diagrams in the dse truncation .",
    "given the limitations of both methods the qualitative and partly even quantitative agreement is remarkable .",
    "a possible non - perturbative definition of the running coupling can be given as follows @xcite : @xmath9 where the dependence of the propagator functions on the renormalisation point have been made explicit .",
    "an important point to notice in the results described above is the unique relation between the gluon and ghost infrared behaviour . as explained",
    "the structure of the ghost dse and the non - renormalization of the ghost - gluon vertex require that in landau gauge the product @xmath10 goes to a constant in the infrared .",
    "the dse result for the running coupling can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "the analytically obtained value for the fixed point of the running coupling in the infrared is @xmath11 for the gauge group su(3 ) in this truncation scheme .",
    "corrections from possible dressings for the ghost - gluon vertex have been found to be such that @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the maximum at non - vanishing momenta seen in our result for the running coupling results in a multi - valued beta - function . on the other hand",
    ", it appears in a region where the above comparison to lattice data suggests that our results are least reliable .",
    "( the physical scale has been fixed by requiring the experimental value @xmath13 . )",
    "we therefore summarize our result for the running coupling in the monotonic fit functions @xcite @xmath14 the value @xmath15 is known from the infrared analysis . in both fits the ultraviolet behaviour of the solution fixes the scale , @xmath16 .",
    "note that we have employed a mom scheme , and thus @xmath17 has to be interpreted as @xmath18 , i.e.  this scale has the expected magnitude .",
    "fit a employs the four additional parameters : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "fit b ( which provides a better description in the ultraviolet at the expense of some deviations at smaller momenta ) has only two free parameters : @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "in the quark dse as well as in the quark loop of the gluon dse the quark - gluon vertex enters , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "very recently lattice results for the quark - gluon vertex became available @xcite .",
    "however , at present the error bars of such simulations are too large to use the lattice results as guideline in the construction of reliable _ anstze _ for the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "meanwhile , we proceed with assuming that the quark - gluon vertex factorizes as follows @xcite , @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 denoting the quark momenta and @xmath28 the gluon momentum .",
    "the non - abelian factor @xmath29 multiplies an abelian part @xmath30 , which carries the tensor structure of the vertex . for the latter we choose a construction @xcite used widely in qed , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as can be infered from the slavnov ",
    "taylor identity for the quark - gluon vertex @xmath31 has to contain factors of the ghost renormalization function @xmath3 .",
    "due to the infrared singularity of the latter the effective low - energy quark - quark interaction is infrared enhanced as compared to the interaction generated by the exchange of an infrared suppressed gluon .",
    "therefore the effective kernel of the quark dse contains an ( integrable ) infrared singularity , for details see ref .",
    "further constraints imposed on @xmath31 are such that ( i ) the running coupling as well as the quark mass function are , as required from general principles , independent of the renormalization point and ( ii ) the one - loop anomalous dimensions of all propagators are reproduced .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we compare our results for the quark propagator @xmath32 in quenched approximation as well as for three massless flavours with lattice data @xcite . as one sees the dse results nicely agree with the one from the lattice .",
    "furthermore , for the considered number of flavours the quenched approximation works well .",
    "( also the gluon and the ghost functions remain almost unchanged @xcite . )    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we display the result of a possible test on positivity violations in the gluon and quark propagators for several choices of the quark - gluon vertex . speaking somewhat sloppily , obtaining negative values for the one - dimensional fourier transforms of propagators provide a sufficient condition for positivity violation ( and thus confinement ) .",
    "whereas previous findings for the gluon propagator are confirmed herewith also beyond quenched approximation we have not been able to demonstrate positivity violation for the quark propagator .",
    "in order to verify the kugo  ojima confinement criterion we have studied the gluon , ghost and quark dyson  schwinger equations of landau gauge qcd employing analytical as well numerical techniques .",
    "the resulting infrared behaviour of gluon and ghost propagators , namely a highly infrared singular ghost and an infrared suppressed gluon propagator , is related to the gribov  zwanziger horizon condition .",
    "the solution for these propagators has then been used to calculate a non - perturbative running coupling for all spacelike momentum scales .    the obtained solutions for the quark propagator exhibit dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "hereby only carefully constructed vertex _ anstze _ have been able to generate masses in the typical phenomenological range of @xmath33 mev .",
    "the agreement with lattice data in quenched approximation confirms the quality of our truncation and in turn it shows that chiral extrapolation on the lattice works well . in the unquenched case including the quark - loop in the gluon equation with @xmath34 light",
    "quarks we obtain only small corrections compared to the quenched calculations . for a larger number of light flavours ( @xmath35 ) we have indications that the coupled system is changed qualitatively , and that the kugo  ojima confinement criterion ceases to be valid .",
    "we looked for positivity violations in the gluon and quark propagators .",
    "we confirmed previous findings that the gluon propagator shows violation of reflection positivity .",
    "we could not find similar violations for the quark propagator . with the results obtained",
    "so far we can not exclude positivity violation for the quarks , however , one might take our result as a further indication that ( in landau gauge ) the confinement mechanism for quarks differs qualitatively from the one for transverse gluons .",
    "finally we want to remark that studies of the dyson ",
    "schwinger equations at non - vanishing temperature ( for first results see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and density are under way .",
    "main goals are hereby to clarify the relation between deconfinement and chiral restauration and to possibly find the deconfinement criterion related to the kugo  ojima criterion .",
