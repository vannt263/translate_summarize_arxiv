    "the center of mass no longer describes a uniform straight trajectory and is a non - trivial degree of freedom . from a geometric point of view , the motion of a rigid body in a potential flow can therefore be considered as a curve on the special euclidian group @xmath14 consisting of all translations and rotations in @xmath15 , where the former describe the orientation of the body while the latter encode the location of the center of mass .    the kinetic energy for the rigid body in a potential flow is a quadratic function and hence determines a metric on @xmath14 .",

    "surprisingly , it was nt until the recent work of @xcite ( smbk ) and @xcite ( bmr ) that the equations of motion for this dynamical system were established .",
    "both groups proceeded through an ad - hoc calculation to derive the equations of motion , and showed that the resulting equations are in fact hamiltonian .",
    "however , both sets of equations are different at first sight .    the smbk equations are formally identical to the kirchhoff equations ( [ kirchhoffeq ] ) together with the point vortex equations ( [ vortexeq ] ) , but the definitions of the momenta @xmath34 and the hamiltonian @xmath35 are modified to include the effect of the rigid body ( through the ambient fluid ) on the point vortices , and vice versa .",

    "somewhat miraculously , the equations of motion obtained by smbk and bmr turn out to be equivalent : @xcite establishes the existence of a poisson map taking the canonical smbk poisson structure into the bmr poisson structure .",

    "most importantly , it is not obvious why one mechanical problem should be governed by two poisson structures , which are at first sight very different but turn out to be related by a certain poisson map .",

    "the remainder of the paper is then devoted to using reduction theory to obtain the equations of motion for the fluid - solid system in a systematic way .",
    "we will derive the equations of motion for this system by reformulating it first as a geodesic flow on the cartesian product of the group @xmath37 of translations and rotations in 2d , and a space of embeddings describing the fluid configurations .",
    "two symmetry groups act on this space : the particle relabelling symmetry group @xmath31 , and the group @xmath37 itself .",

    "the dynamics is governed by a * _ magnetic symplectic form _ * : it is the sum of the canonical symplectic forms on both factors , together with a non - canonical interaction term . from a physical point of view",

    "recall that symplectic reduction reduces the system to a co - adjoint orbit ; as we shall see below , in the case of fluids interacting with solids these co - adjoint orbits are precisely labelled by the vorticity of the fluid .",
    "symplectic reduction  in particular the selection of one particular level set of the momentum map  therefore amounts to imposing a specific form for the vorticity field . in our case , this is where we introduce the assumption that the vorticity is concentrated in @xmath24 point vortices . in the case of poisson reduction",
    ", we would have obtained the equations of motion for a rigid body interacting with an arbitrary vorticity field .",
    "after factoring out the particle relabeling symmetry , the resulting dynamical system is invariant under translations and rotations in the plane and can then be reduced with respect to the group @xmath37 .",
    "this is the subject of section  [ sec : redse ] .",
    "physically , this corresponds to rewriting the equations of motion obtained after the first reduction in body coordinates .",
    "however , because of the presence of the magnetic term in the symplectic form and the fact that @xmath37 acts diagonally on @xmath38 , this is not a straightforward task .",
    "first , we derive the reduced poisson structure on the reduced space @xmath36 . because of the magnetic contributions to the symplectic form , the reduced poisson structure is not just the sum of the poisson structures on the individual factors , but includes certain non - canonical contributions as well .",
    "we then show that the momentum map for the @xmath18-symmetry naturally defines a poisson map taking this poisson structure into the product poisson structure , possibly with a cocycle if the momentum map is not equivariant ( this happens when the total strength of the point vortices is nonzero ) .",
    "we do the computations for a general product @xmath39 first , where @xmath35 is a lie group , @xmath40 is a symplectic manifold , and the product is equipped with a magnetic symplectic form . in this way , we generalize the `` coupling to a lie group '' scenario ( see @xcite ) to the case where magnetic terms are present .    in this way",
    ", the results of smbk and bmr are put on a firm geometric footing : the bmr poisson structure is the one obtained through reduction and involves the interaction terms , while the smbk poisson structure is simply the product poisson structure . the poisson map induced by the @xmath37-momentum map described above turns out to be precisely shashikanth s poisson map . as a consequence",

    "this procedure is worked out in the body of the paper  here we would like to reflect on the similarities with other dynamical systems .",
    "recall that the dynamics of a particle of charge @xmath42 in a magnetic field @xmath43 can be described in two ways .",

    "an over - arching way of looking at the dynamics of a charged particle in a magnetic field is as a geodesic problem ( with respect to a certain metric ) on a higher - dimensional space : this is part of the famed * _ kaluza - klein approach_*. in this case , spacetime is replaced by the product manifold @xmath50 and charged particles trace out geodesics on this augmented space .",
    "the standard , four - dimensional formulation of the dynamics can then be obtained by dividing out by the internal @xmath51-symmetry , resulting in the familiar lorentz equations on @xmath52 .",
    "more information about these constructions can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our approach to the fluid - structure problem is similar but more involved because of the presence of two different symmetry groups .",
    "however , the underlying philosophy is the same : by reformulating the motion of a rigid body and the fluid as a geodesic problem on an infinite - dimensional manifold , we follow the philosophy of kaluza - klein of trading in the complexities in the equations of motion for an increase in the number of dimensions of the configuration space",
    ". then , by dividing out the @xmath53-symmetry , we obtain a reduced dynamical system governed by a magnetic symplectic form ( the analogue of ( [ magsymplectic ] ) ) , which is mapped after a suitable momentum shift @xmath54 into an equivalent dynamical system governed by the canonical symplectic form but with a modified hamiltonian . after reducing by the residual @xmath18-symmetry ,",

    "<S> we derive the equations of motion for a planar rigid body of circular shape moving in a 2d perfect fluid with point vortices using symplectic reduction by stages . after formulating the theory as a mechanical system on a configuration space which is the product of a space of embeddings and the special euclidian group in two dimensions , we divide out by the particle relabelling symmetry and then by the residual rotational and translational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the first stage reduction is that the system is described by a non - standard magnetic symplectic form encoding the effects of the fluid , while at the second stage , a careful analysis of the momentum map shows the existence of two equivalent poisson structures for this problem . for the solid - fluid system </S>",
    "<S> , we hence recover the ad hoc poisson structures calculated by shashikanth , marsden , burdick and kelly on the one hand , and borisov , mamaev , and ramodanov on the other hand . as a side result , we obtain a convenient expression for the symplectic leaves of the reduced system and we shed further light on the interplay between curvatures and cocycles in the description of the dynamics . </S>"
