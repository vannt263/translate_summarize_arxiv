    "the most luminous stars in old populations are expected to be those that have departed from the top of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and are evolving to the left in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) at nearly constant luminosity . around spectral type f ,",
    "bolometric corrections are smallest , making these `` yellow '' post - agb ( pagb ) stars the visually brightest members of globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "the tenth - magnitude f - type star roa  24 in @xmath3  centauri ( also cataloged as hd  116745 and `` fehrenbach s star '' ) is the only star in any gc bright enough to be listed in the _ henry draper catalogue _ ( harding 1965 ; dickens & powell 1973 ; gonzalez & wallerstein 1992 ) . it has often been considered to be a pagb star  but see our discussion below in  5.3 .",
    "the galactic gc ngc  5986 contains two yellow pagb stars ( alves , bond , & onken 2001 ) , likewise the brightest members of their cluster . in the hrd , stars of this rare type lie some four magnitudes above the horizontal branch ( hb ) and rr  lyrae stars .",
    "analogs of these objects are known in the field .",
    "two examples are bd  + 39@xmath44926 ( slettebak , bahner , & stock 1961 ) and hd  46703 ( bond 1970 ; luck & bond 1984 ) .",
    "both are long - period spectroscopic binaries , with orbital periods of 775  days for bd  + 39@xmath44926 ( kodaira , greenstein , & oke 1970 ) and 600  days for hd  46703 ( hrivnak et al .",
    "there is no published evidence that bd  + 39@xmath44926 has a variable brightness .",
    "however , the cooler hd  46703 lies in a high - luminosity extension of the rr  lyrae pulsational instability strip ; it is a semiregular variable with a range of @xmath50.3  mag and a main period of about 29  days ( bond et al .",
    "1984 ; hrivnak et al .",
    "2008 ; aikawa 2010 ) .",
    "it has been suggested ( bond 1997a , b ; see also vickers et al .",
    "2015 ) that f- and a - type pagb stars should be useful population  ii standard candles , because on theoretical grounds there should be a sharp upper limit to their luminosity function",
    ". moreover , they are easy to detect using broadband photometry on small telescopes , as their low surface gravities give them extremely large balmer jumps . in the late 1990 s , h.e.b .",
    "and collaborators began to develop a photometric system optimized for the efficient discovery of such stars .",
    "this system combines the @xmath6 filter of thuan & gunn ( 1976 ) , whose bandpass lies almost entirely shortward of the balmer jump , with the standard broadband johnson - kron - cousins _ bvi _ filters .",
    "the design principles of this _ ubvi _ system were described by bond ( 2005 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "a network of standard stars was established by siegel & bond ( 2005 , hereafter paper  ii ) , based on extensive observations with ccd cameras at 0.9- and 1.5-m telescopes at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) and cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "in this paper we report our discovery , using _ ubvi _",
    "photometry , of a bright pagb star in the gc m79 ( ngc  1904 ) .",
    "we then present follow - up photometric and spectroscopic monitoring aimed at placing limits on the variability and binarity of the star .",
    "we close with a negative search for circumstellar dust , an argument for the case that population  ii pagb stars are indeed promising standard candles , and a discussion of their evolutionary status .",
    "an appendix presents photometry of several known variable stars in  m79 .",
    "as part of our _ ubvi _ survey of the galactic gcs , m79 was imaged on 1997 november  7 with the ctio 0.9-m telescope and a tek @xmath7 ccd detector , giving a field of view of @xmath8 .",
    "exposure times in _ ubvi _ were 400 , 60 , 45 , and 60  s , respectively .",
    "these are relatively shallow frames , aimed at detecting luminous pagb stars without saturating their images .",
    "the frames were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using the ccdproc task in iraf , and instrumental stellar magnitudes were measured with the daophot tasks allstar and daogrow ( stetson 1990 ) . after correction for atmospheric extinction , the photometry was calibrated to the _ ubvi _ system using observations on the same night of standard - star fields from paper  ii .",
    "we show the resulting color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of m79 in @xmath9 vs.  @xmath10 in figure  1a , and in @xmath9 vs.  @xmath11 in figure  1b . to reduce field - star contamination ( which is already quite small ) , we plot only stars lying within @xmath12 from the cluster center . because of source confusion , all of the plotted stars are at least @xmath13 from the center .",
    "the data have not been corrected for the cluster s very small reddening of @xmath14 ( harris 1996harris / mwgc.dat ] ) .",
    "harris gives an m79 distance of 12.9  kpc and a metallicity of @xmath15=-1.60 $ ] .",
    "cmds for m79 , generally reaching considerably deeper than ours , have been published previously by a number of authors , including ferraro et al .",

    "2007 ) , dalessandro et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and kopacki ( 2015 ) .",
    "these studies used ground - based ccd data and , in the cases of dalessandro et al .  and lanzoni et al . , space - based _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) and _ galaxy evolution explorer _",
    "( _ galex _ ) observations .",
    "all of these authors have shown that the cluster has an extremely blue hb with a long blue tail , and a sparsely populated agb  a cmd that is remarkably similar to that of the better - known m13 .",
    "our _ bvi _ data plotted in figures  1a and 1b are in complete agreement with these findings .    in figure  1c",
    "we plot the @xmath16 color difference vs.  @xmath11 .",
    "the color difference is an analog in the _ ubvi _ system of the @xmath17 index in the strmgren system ; it measures the size of the balmer jump , while being relatively insensitive to reddening and metallicity ( see paper  i for details ) .",
    "the plot shows only stars brighter than @xmath18 , and individual stars with errors in either coordinate greater than @xmath190.06  mag have been deleted . the distribution of objects peaking on the left - hand side of this figure contains the hb stars , while the sequence of objects on the right - hand side are the subgiants and red giants , plus a small number of agb stars .",
    "the objects clumped around @xmath20 are a few foreground field stars .",
    "five stars stand out in the cmds and color - color diagrams .",
    "most conspicuous is the very bright pagb candidate , marked with red filled circles in the three plots ; this star is prominent in the @xmath16 vs.  @xmath11 diagram because of its unusually large balmer - jump index .",
    "stars with such colors are extremely rare , leaving little doubt that the object is a pagb star belonging to the cluster .",
    "there are also four hot , blue stars lying above the hb , marked with blue filled circles in all three plots in figure  1 . such objects are usually interpreted as stars evolving off the blue hb , destined to become white dwarfs without ascending the agb  the so - called agb - manqu ( agb - m ) stars . table  1 lists properties of these five stars . a finding chart is presented in figure  2 .",
    "the two optically faintest agb - m objects are extremely hot stars , which are very bright in the far- and near - ultraviolet ( fuv and nuv , respectively ) .",
    "they had been noted by hill et al .",
    "( 1992 ) in their _",
    "astro-1 _ spacelab ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) observations of m79 , and were designated uit  1 and uit  2 .    at an absolute magnitude of @xmath1 ( see below ) , the m79 pagb star is by far the visually brightest member of its cluster , and in fact marginally the visually absolutely brightest star known in any gc . to our knowledge , in spite of the many investigations of m79 referenced above , the star had not been recognized previously as belonging to the cluster . in most studies",
    "it goes unmentioned , and has apparently been dismissed as a foreground star ; actually , in typical deep ccd exposures , its image would be saturated .",
    "the object was , however , designated as star `` h '' in a photographic study of m79 by stetson & harris ( 1977 ) , who used it as one of their calibration stars ; they gave photoelectric measurements of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "hill et al .",
    "( 1992 ) noted its brightness in the nuv  it is the brightest star in their nuv frame  but considered it to be `` an early f - type field star '' ( it being very faint in their fuv image ) .",
    "our discovery of the pagb star in m79 was communicated privately to ahin & lambert ( 2009 , hereafter sl09 ) , who obtained high - resolution spectra at mcdonald observatory and carried out an abundance analysis .",
    "sl09 reported a very low iron content and a radial velocity ( rv ) of @xmath24 , consistent with the cluster s rv of @xmath25 and velocity dispersion of @xmath26 ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "both the low metallicity and the velocity clearly establish the star s membership in the gc .",
    "their spectroscopic analysis yielded an effective temperature and surface gravity of @xmath27  k and @xmath28 .",
    "the very low @xmath29 implied by our _ ubvi _ photometry was thus verified .",
    "the stellar parameters of the m79 pagb star are very similar to those of the field pagb star hd  46703 ( @xmath30  k , @xmath31 ; luck & bond 1984 ) .",
    "an interesting result of the sl09 analysis was that its iron abundance , @xmath15=-2.0 $ ] , is about 0.6  dex lower than that of the cluster s red giants .",
    "a similar effect has been seen in field pagb stars ( e.g. , bond 1991 ) , and discussed in terms of depletion of metals onto grains ( e.g. , hrivnak et al.2008 and references therein ) , but for field stars the progenitor s original metallicity is considerably less certain .",
    "m79 has been imaged more recently in the nuv with the ultraviolet optical telescope ( uvot ) onboard the _ swift _ gamma - ray - burst satellite ( siegel et al .",
    "2014 ) . in the uvot s _ uvw2 _ bandpass at @xmath51928   ,",
    "the pagb star and the four agb - m stars of our table  1 are the five brightest stars in m79 ( siegel et al . , their figure  7 ) .",
    "as noted above , a subset of f - type pagb stars like hd  46703 are pulsating variables , lying in an extension of the rr  lyrae instability strip .",
    "the m79 pagb star has an effective temperature similar to that of hd  46703 ( although both the spectroscopic analyses and optical photometry do imply it to be slightly hotter ) .",
    "we have carried out a program of photometric monitoring to determine whether the m79 star is likewise a pulsating variable .",
    "the observations , made by chilean service personnel , used the 1.3-m smarts consortium telescope at ctio and its andicam ccd camera .",
    "data were obtained on the m79 pagb star and surrounding field on 224 nights between 2007 february 20 and 2011 may  8 .",
    "a typical cadence was every five days , chosen so that a pulsation period of around one month would be easily detected . on each night , two exposures of 30  s each were obtained in @xmath32 and in @xmath9 .",
    "the usable field of view of these images is about @xmath33 .",
    "the andicam frames were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded in the smarts pipeline at yale university .",
    "we then carried out photometry on the reduced images .",
    "the point - spread function ( psf ) of each frame was determined with the daophot allstar routine , using 18 bright , isolated stars in the field .",
    "the central portion of this psf ( a region slightly larger than the fwhm ) was then fit to both the program object and several nearby targets chosen as photometric comparison stars , in order to determine differential magnitudes .",
    "instrumental magnitudes determined in this way were generally precise at a level of @xmath50.005  mag for the pagb star , and @xmath50.007  mag for typical fainter comparison stars , except for a few frames affected by thick clouds or poor seeing .    for the final analysis , we determined differential magnitudes between the pagb star and the sum of intensities of eight nearby , constant - brightness comparison stars . since the pagb star is bluer than all of the comparison stars ( which are a combination of field stars and bright red giants in the cluster ) , we removed a small mean trend with airmass in the @xmath32 magnitudes ( there was no airmass dependence detected for the @xmath9 magnitudes ) .    in figure  3",
    "we plot the differential magnitudes in @xmath32 and @xmath9 , with arbitrary zero points .",
    "we see no evidence for variability , certainly not at the level of the @xmath50.3  mag range of hd  46703 .",
    "there is marginal evidence for slow , low - amplitude variations , particularly during 2009 , but these may well be subtle seasonal variations of an instrumental origin .",
    "we also took advantage of this collection of frames for a study of several known variable stars in m79 ; see appendix  a.",
    "as noted in the introduction , several of the known metal - poor a- and f - type pagb stars in the field are known to be long - period spectroscopic binaries . to investigate whether the m79 pagb star is also a binary , we monitored its rv on 67 nights over the interval from 2007 february  21 to 2012 january  29 .",
    "the queue - scheduled spectroscopic observations were made by chilean service observers with the smarts 1.5-m telescope at ctio , using the rc - focus spectrograph equipped with a ccd camera .",
    "two different setups were employed with grating number 47 : setting `` 47/ii , '' covering 38784552   , was used primarily during the first half of the observing interval ; during the second half , setting `` 47/iib , '' covering 40704744   , was used for most of the observations .",
    "both setups yielded a spectral resolution of 1.6   .",
    "exposure times each night were generally @xmath34  s , and short exposures of a hear calibration lamp were taken before and after each set of stellar observations .",
    "the ccd images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded , combined for cosmic - ray removal , and then the stellar spectrum was extracted and wavelength - calibrated , all using standard iraf routines . in figure  4 , we show a spectrum created by combining all of the data , and normalizing to a flat continuum .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by sharp , strong lines of the balmer series and h and k. all other lines are relatively quite weak .    on about half of the nights , an rv standard star was observed with the same grating setup .",
    "the standard stars we used were 6  ceti ( 2 spectra with 47/ii , 1 with 47/iib ) , 5  serpentis ( 2 spectra with 47/iib ) , 10  tauri ( 4 spectra with 47/ii , 15 with 47/iib ) , and @xmath35  virginis ( 2 spectra with 47/ii , 6 with 47/iib ) .",
    "we adopted the absolute rvs for these stars given by stefanik , latham , & torres ( 1999 ) .",
    "we used the iraf task fxcor , which determines rvs ( including corrections to the heliocentric frame ) through cross - correlation of the program spectrum with a spectrum of a star of known rv .",
    "we employed a two - stage process .",
    "first , each individual spectrum of the m79 star was cross - correlated with each of the standard - star spectra taken with the same setup , and for each pagb spectrum we adopted the mean of these determinations . because the h and k features in the standard stars are much stronger and broader than in the pagb star , and because the metallic lines are so weak in the pagb star , we only used small 40   - wide wavelength windows around h@xmath36 and h@xmath37 for this first pass .",
    "the mean rv of the pagb star was found to be @xmath38 for the 47/ii observations , and @xmath39 for 47/iib , with standard deviations of 5.0 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the spectra of the pagb star and the standard stars , which are f - type subgiants and dwarfs with much higher metallicities and gravities , are not very well matched .",
    "therefore , in a second pass , we cross - correlated each individual pagb spectrum with the ensemble of all pagb spectra taken with the same setup , setting the standard velocity of each spectrum in the ensemble to the mean velocity from the first pass , @xmath41 . in the second pass , the entire spectral wavelength range was used in the correlations .",
    "this resulted in mean rvs of @xmath42 for the 47/ii spectra , and @xmath43 for the 47/iib spectra , with standard deviations of 4.7 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "figure  5 plots our final velocities versus time .",
    "there is no evidence for variations in excess of the errors .",
    "the peak - to - peak rv variations for bd  + 39@xmath44926 and hd  46703 are @xmath530 and @xmath45 , respectively ( kodaira , greenstein , & oke 1970 ; hrivnak et al .",
    "velocity variations of this size are definitely ruled out for the m79 pagb star , but , given the modest precision of our measurements , we can not exclude a binary with a low rv amplitude , or one viewed close to pole - on .",
    "substantial circumstellar ( cs ) dust is a well - known feature of pagb stars belonging to galactic - disk populations ( see the review by van winckel 2003 , and references therein ) . to search for cs dust around the m79 pagb star",
    ", we determined its spectral - energy distribution ( sed ) by combining our optical photometry ( table  1 ) with the _ swift _ uvot measurements by siegel et al.(2014 ) , and near- and mid - ir photometry from 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) and _ wise _ ( wright et al .",
    "these data points are plotted in figure  6 . also shown",
    "is a blackbody spectrum for @xmath46  k , which is the effective temperature of the m79 star determined in the spectroscopic analysis by sl09 .",
    "as the figure illustrates , the blackbody curve fits the sed extremely well .",
    "there is no evidence for cs dust out to a wavelength of @xmath47 , and the star was not detected by _ wise _ at @xmath48 .",
    "the lack of dust may plausibly be explained in part by the star s low metallicity , making dust formation difficult in the first place ; however , the photospheric iron depletion , mentioned in  2 , may require that there was some dust formation in the past . in any case , the long post - agb",
    "evolutionary timescales for low - mass remnants in old stellar populations may allow sufficient time for any cs dust that was formed to have dissipated .",
    "note also that near- or mid - ir excesses have not been detected in the field analogs bd  + 39@xmath44926 and hd  46703 .",
    "a further conclusion is that the m79 pagb star will not produce a planetary nebula ( pn ) .",
    "it has been argued that the few pne known in milky way and local group gcs are descended from binary - star interactions , and not from single stars ( e.g. , jacoby et al .",
    "2013 ; bond 2015 ; and references therein ) .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , it has been proposed that yellow pagb stars in old populations are promising standard candles . in table  2 , we assemble @xmath9-band photometry for four such candidates known in gcs : roa  24 in @xmath3  cen , the two in ngc  5986 , and the m79 star discussed in this paper .",
    "we calculated visual absolute magnitudes , using the visual apparent distance moduli from the sources cited in the table .",
    "roa  24 deserves some discussion .",
    "it has traditionally been considered to be a pagb star , along with the visually second - brightest star in @xmath3  cen , the rv  tauri - type variable v1 ( e.g. , gonzalez & wallerstein 1994 ; van loon et al.2007 ; mcdonald et al .",
    "however , the bolometric luminosities of both stars are below that of the agb tip in @xmath3  cen ( for example , mcdonald et al.2009 , their fig .",
    "3 ; mcdonald et al .",
    "2011 , their fig .  1 ) .",
    "this suggests that roa  24 and v1 may more properly be regarded as post - early - agb stars ( e.g. , dorman et al .",
    "1993 , their fig .  1 ) , rather than stars evolving off the tip of the agb . in our table  2 , the absolute magnitude of roa  24 is indeed @xmath50.20.3  mag fainter than for the other three pagb candidates .    setting aside roa  24 , we find a mean visual absolute magnitude for the remaining three stars in table  2 of @xmath49 , with a standard deviation of 0.09  mag , and an error of the mean of only 0.05  mag .",
    "this scatter is considerably smaller than the cosmic scatter in the period - luminosity relation for cepheid variables .",
    "there is no evidence for variability or circumstellar dust for any of the stars , strengthening the case that they are well - behaved candidates for standard candles .",
    "they are intrinsically four magnitudes brighter than rr  lyrae stars , and as bright as cepheids with periods of about 5.3  days . moreover , unlike rr  lyrae stars and cepheids , pagb stars do not require a long series of photometric observations for their discovery : the total exposure time , with a 0.9-m telescope , needed to discover the m79 star was less than 10  minutes .",
    "they are expected to be present in old populations that do not contain cepheids , including elliptical galaxies and dwarf spheroidals . and",
    "these objects should exist in halos of spiral galaxies , where there are fewer complications due to interstellar extinction than encountered for population  i cepheids in the disks .",
    "a practical difficulty is the existence of fainter , but still very low - gravity , stars like roa  24 and v1 in @xmath3  cen . for pagb stars to be a robust distance indicator",
    ", it will be necessary to sample a large enough population to assure that the upper edge of the luminosity function has been detected .    in subsequent papers",
    ", we will report searches for additional pagb stars in gcs and in the halo of m31 . in the next few years",
    ", we expect that parallaxes from _ gaia _ will provide an excellent zero - point calibration , based on pagb stars in the field , as well as in galactic  gcs .",
    "for a mean @xmath50 , and neglecting the small difference in bolometric corrections between them and the sun ( @xmath51 ) , the pagb candidates in ngc  5986 and m79 have an average luminosity of @xmath52 . using the theoretical core - mass / luminosity relation for pagb stars of vassiliadis & wood ( 1994 ) , @xmath53",
    ", we find a core mass of @xmath2 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the masses inferred for white dwarfs in gcs ( e.g. , kalirai et al .",
    "2009 found @xmath54 for the white dwarfs in four galactic gcs ) .",
    "thus the case is strengthened that these three stars are in their final pagb evolutionary stages , just before arriving at the top of the white - dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "however , we can not entirely rule out more complicated scenarios such as those involving binary interactions .",
    "complete surveys for these objects in the galactic gc system , and in the halos of nearby spirals , would provide information on the lifetimes of the f- and a - type pagb stars , and thus shed more light on their evolutionary status .",
    "we thank the stsci director s discretionary research fund for supporting our participation in the smarts consortium , fred walter for scheduling the 1.5-m queue observations , and phil massey for advice on the use of fxcor .",
    "we especially appreciate the excellent work of the ctio / smarts service observers who obtained the direct images and spectra during many long clear tololo nights : claudio aguilera , edgardo cosgrove , juan espinoza , manuel hernndez , rodrigo hernndez , alberto miranda , alberto pasten , jacqueline seron , john subasavage , joselino vasquez , and jos velsquez .",

    "<S> .    we also detected four very hot stars lying above the horizontal branch ( `` agb - manqu '' stars ) ; along with the pagb star , they are the brightest objects in m79 in the near ultraviolet . in an appendix , we give periods and light curves for five variables in m79 : three rr  lyrae stars , a type  ii cepheid , and a semiregular variable . </S>"
