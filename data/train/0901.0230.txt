    "one of the most prominent experimental discoveries made at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has been the suppression of highly energetic particles @xcite , which suggests that the matter created at rhic is a color - opaque , high density medium of colored degrees of freedom where fast partons quickly lose energy by gluon emission @xcite .",
    "measurements of anisotropies in soft particle momentum distributions @xcite have further indicated that soft degrees of freedom are approximately thermalized .",
    "the degree of thermalization has been found to be considerably above the predictions @xcite obtained within perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) and , in fact , it seems to be compatible with the `` perfect fluid '' scenario where the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) has almost zero viscosity @xcite .",
    "these two findings , taken together , suggest that the energy deposited by the jet into the medium is thermalized and becomes part of the fluid .",
    "the theory governing the further evolution of this energy is that of hydrodynamic sound waves .",
    "it was noticed in the 19th century that , when a probe travels through a fluid with a speed greater than the speed of sound , the energy deposited by the probe creates a forward moving conical shock - wave .",
    "the reason for this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ machgeom ] : at each point the deposited energy becomes a sound - wave , which moves at the speed of sound @xmath0 .",
    "the spherical waves interfere coherently creating the shock wave @xcite .",
    "[ machgeom ] can be used , together with a simple geometrical argument , to show that the cone angle is related to the speed of sound @xmath0 and the velocity of the jet @xmath1 as @xmath2 and , thus , an experimental observation of a mach cone provides both a proof of the fluid - like behavior of the underlying system and a direct probe of its equation of state .",
    "this idea actually predates the current investigations about sqgp and even quark - gluon plasma by decades @xcite .    similarly to ordinary sound waves , mach cone shocks dissipate exponentially ( @xmath3 ) with respect to the wave - number @xmath4 and the distance traveled @xmath5 , where the characteristic sound wave attenuation length @xmath6 is related to the shear viscosity @xmath7 , the energy density @xmath8 , and the pressure @xmath9 @xmath10",
    "therefore , the presence of a mach cone signal would be an exponentially precise confirmation of the low viscosity fluid limit , which is in principle more sensitive to @xmath7 than even anisotropic flow .    as with all heavy ion observables sensitive to hydrodynamic behavior ,",
    "the mach cone signal suffers from the problem that we do not `` see '' the fluid directly : only the final many - particle correlations are measured and they are sensitive to all stages of the hydrodynamic evolution including the late ( presumably non - thermalized ) stages and freeze - out ( which is not understood from first principles ) . a rough approximation is to assume that at a certain locus in space - time @xmath11 the mean free path goes from zero to infinity .",
    "this locus can be defined in terms of a local criterion ( e.g. a common freeze - out temperature ) , or using a simple global geometry ( isochronous freeze - out ) . using stoke s theorem , as well as entropy",
    ", energy and momentum conservation yields the famous cooper - frye ( cf ) formula @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the collective flow vector , @xmath14 the standard boltzmann , bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution function ( in terms of temperature @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 is the 4-momentum vector @xmath17 of the associated particle .",
    "using an azimuthal coordinate system and putting the jet direction at the origin yields a characteristic distribution @xmath18 with two mach cone - like peaks shown in fig .",
    "[ machscheme ] .",
    "note that `` theoretically '' this is an _ average _ distribution since we _ define _ the near - side jet to be at @xmath19 .",
    "experimentally , however , this is a 2-particle correlation : the experiment measures a high momentum ",
    "jet \" particle ( the near - side trigger ) and then looks at the correlation between the trigger and softer ( sensitive to flow ) particles in the opposite direction ( away - side region , where it is assumed that the jet passed through the medium , was suppressed , and its energy thermalized into mach shocks ) .",
    "tantalizingly , something similar does seem to be observed in the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ jetexp ] ) : when a hard ( jet - like ) particle is correlated with a soft ( medium - like ) particle , the `` missing '' away - side jet signal reappears and shows a structure very similar to that of a mach cone with an angle close to the expectation for the ideal gas speed of sound @xmath20 .    it should be said that this result has generated a lot of skepticism and some debate ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the `` dip '' between the mach cone peaks arises most clearly when the background 2-particle correlation ( arising , for example , from the ellipticity of the initial fireball ) is subtracted ( zyam method ) .",
    "this subtraction makes possibly unjustified assumptions , e.g. , that the mach cone correlation and the elliptic correlation are independent .",
    "moreover , different theoretical interpretations have been given to the apparent conical structure @xcite , which indicates that further studies involving , for instance , 3-particle correlations @xcite and the dependence of the mach cone angle on various other variables @xcite should be pursued .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental observation of something that looks like a mach cone has greatly enhanced the theoretical interest on this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "in particular , an interesting question that still remains to be properly answered is to what extent does the `` naive '' mach cone picture introduced earlier survive when realistic physics conditions are introduced .",
    "recent studies seem to indicate the cone+diffusion wake picture , and the relative weight of the two , are remarkably independent of the energy - deposition scenario @xcite .    in the next few sections we shall examine this issue in detail .",
    "section [ sechydro ] describes an analysis of mach cone propagation using ideal three - dimensional full ( non - linear ) hydrodynamics , which shows that the observable signal depends crucially on how energy and momentum are deposited by the jet into the medium .",
    "section [ secads ] uses the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence to try to obtain insights into the non - equilibrium dynamics displayed by this problem , introduces the `` head + neck '' decomposition of the space - time region near the jet ( based on the degree of thermalization of the medium ) , and derives the contribution of each region to the particle correlations . section [ secpqcd ] does an analogous analysis with an energy - momentum source calculated in pqcd coupled with ideal hydrodynamics and describes the observable differences with respect to results obtained using ads / cft .",

    "lorentz indices are denoted with greek letters @xmath22 . throughout this paper",
    "we shall use a coordinate system corresponding to axial symmetry with respect to the trigger jet axis .",
    "the components of a generic vector @xmath5 will be @xmath23 coordinates , where @xmath24 are taken to be parallel / perpendicular to the near - side jet .",
    "the jet is assumed to be moving transversely with respect to the beam ( z axis ) so the rapidity of the jet is taken to be zero .",

    "( [ machangle ] ) are only valid in the _ linearized _ hydrodynamics limit where the energy of the sound waves is small compared to the energy density of the background .",
    "the physical applicability of this condition is doubtful since the order of magnitude of the jet s `` size '' @xmath26 fm , which leads to an overwhelming energy density close to it even for moderate rates of energy deposition .",
    "a `` pile - up '' of sound waves in front of the jet as it travels through the medium can also result in strong non - linear corrections to the fluid s flow profile .",
    "furthermore , if the energy deposition is _ small _ with respect to the background , an observable signal will not survive the _ thermal _ background fluctuations inherent in a cf freeze - out .",
    "it is relatively easy to show _ analytically _ @xcite that this is the case unless _ either _ the strength of the signal is large enough to require a non - linearized treatment _ or _ the momentum is large enough to put the thermalization assumption in doubt .",

    "it is clear that in the strict linearized limit the azimuthal distribution only has a trivial broad peak at @xmath45 .",
    "a double - peaked structure in the away - side of the jet correlation function can only arise when the bessel function expansion is invalid , i.e. , away from the linearized limit or for large @xmath46 .",
    "for such large momenta , contamination from non - thermalized degrees of freedom and coalescence @xcite effects are non - negligible .",
    "on the other hand , for a non - linear perturbation in the medium it is not clear that the mach cone angle is anything like the one derived geometrically in the introduction . for large energy depositions , the more appropriate description is that of an angular _ shock _ , i.e. , a step function in energy density .",
    "this problem was analyzed analytically in @xcite , where the angle was found to be in general larger than the geometrical expectation from mach s law .",
    "deviations from equilibration , expected in the region where the energy deposition from the jet is comparable to the local energy density , may also lead to a different cone angle .",
    "in addition , the mach cone is not the _ only _ collective mode that can be excited by the moving jet .",
    "the ratio of momentum to energy deposition is not known but a common assumption is to have the same amount of energy and momentum being deposited by the jet .",
    "longitudinal momentum deposition results in a column of fluid that flows in the direction of the jet s motion .",
    "this structure is known as a the `` diffusion wake '' .",
    "we have taken all these effects into account in ref .",
    "@xcite where we studied energy and momentum deposition in a static medium using the 3d ideal hydrodynamics shasta code presented in @xcite .",
    "note that the simulations presented below only refer to a static thermal background , and as such neglect the effects of transverse and longitudinal flow ( which are a simple deformation in the linearized approximation @xcite but can be non - trivial in full nonlinear hydrodynamics @xcite ) .",
    "[ diffwake ] shows what happens when the momentum deposition is included in the full hydrodynamic simulations @xcite : the temperature profile remains invariant and maintains the correct angle .",
    "however , the flow profile acquires an additional component co - moving with the jet .",
    "[ machdetail ] for a sketch of all these effects combined .",
    "it then becomes clear that the appearance of a cone - like signal _ in hydrodynamics _ is _ not _ assured , since the strongest signals may come from contributions which are not conical and possibly not locally equilibrated .",
    "more complicated momentum depositions , such as including transverse momentum , or introducing a momentum dependence of the deposited energy ( the so - called `` bragg peak '' ) do not change these conclusions qualitatively @xcite",
    ".    -fig .",
    "[ barbarafo ] shows what happens after freeze out : when conical distributions dominate , the system does exhibit a cone signal with the correct angle , albeit the momenta of the associated particles are so high that one is likely to question their effective thermalization once the ideal fluid approximation is relaxed . on the other hand , when the diffusion wake is significant the only correlation visible is a unique peak in the away - side , which is indistinguishable from a generic peak expected from momentum conservation .    to strengthen this conclusion , note that the pure energy deposition scheme may be completely undetectable in a realistic and approximately isothermal freeze - out condition since hotter regions",
    "will simply freeze - out _ later_. momentum flow , however , will persist independently of freeze - out and will in general be modified only a little by the last ( cooler ) stages of the fireball evolution .",

    ", a phenomenological hydrodynamical approach shows that mach cones are not _ guaranteed _ to appear in the final angular correlation functions .",
    "the problem of the away - side jet correlations in the sqgp is a very interesting and complicated subject because of its inherent out of equilibrium , non - linear , and non - perturbative features .",
    "an interesting development in this direction was provided by the possibility of using string theory dualities to calculate observables in a strongly coupled gauge theory without the  a priori \" equilibration assumptions .",

    "thus , while we assume in the background the perfect fluid @xmath179 limit of the full anomalous chromo - viscous equations derived in @xcite , we also retain the anomalous diffusion stress neufeld source @xcite that we rewrite in the more easily recognized joule heating form ( see eqs .",
    "( 6.2 - 6.11 ) of @xcite ) @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the external yang - mills field tensor and @xmath182 is the color current that is related via ohm s law to @xmath183 through the ( diagonal in color ) conductivity rank three tensor @xmath184 .",
    "the @xmath185 denotes a convolution over the nonlocal non - static conductive dynamical response of the polarizable plasma .",

    "( 28 ) of @xcite factorize into the joule heating @xmath190 form above .    the covariant generalization of neufeld s source is easiest in fourier decomposition with @xmath191 and the color conductivity expression derived in @xcite @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the effective plasma equilibrium distribution with @xmath194 . here , @xmath13 is the 4-velocity of the plasma as in eq .",
    "( [ hydrotensor ] ) . for an isotropic plasma @xmath195 . in the long wavelength limit , @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the debye screening mass for a noninteracting plasma of massless @xmath171 gluons in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the relaxation or decoherence time @xmath198 is of the generic form noted in @xcite @xmath199 with @xmath200 being the collisional momentum relaxation time @xcite , @xmath201 being the color diffusion time defined in @xcite in terms of the debye electric and assumed @xmath202 magnetic screening masses , and @xmath203 being the anomalous strong electric and magnetic field relaxation time derived in eq .",
    "( 6.42 ) of @xcite .",
    "note that one can express @xmath204 in terms of the local knudsen number .",
    "however , because @xmath205 , eq.([anom ] ) is really an implicit equation for @xmath206 . combining these relations and taking into account the uncertainty principle constraint discussed in section [ secads ] and ( @xmath207 ) @xcite , @xmath208 as @xmath151 gets large , @xmath206 can get small even in the weak coupling limit .",
    "thus , large gradients , which are the hallmark of the neck zone , increase the importance of anomalous relaxation over color diffusion and collisional relaxation .",
    "short relaxation times arise not only in the strong coupling but also in the weak coupling but classical field limits .",
    "the full source @xmath209 was computed analytically by neufeld in ref .",
    "@xcite and it reads @xmath210 the components of the source term are reproduced below for convenience @xmath211\\ ] ] @xmath212\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 for a quark .",
    "these equations were obtained in the limit where the dielectric functions that describe the medium s response to the color fields created by the heavy quark were set to unity .",
    "the effects from medium screening on @xmath217 were studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our numerical calculations",
    "we used @xmath218 as an infrared cutoff while the minimum lattice spacing naturally provided an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "the background temperature was set to @xmath219 gev .",
    "this result holds for the weak coupling , long relaxation time @xmath220 limit . in this limit",
    "the color conductivity is large and joule heating efficiently converts field energy and momentum into plasma heating and collective flow .",
    "the most interesting aspect of this for the present applications is the effect of highly inhomogeneous anisotropic lorentz contracted coulomb field of a uniformly moving heavy quark and color casimir @xmath221 on the collective flow pattern imprinted on the plasma .",
    "we now turn to the observable consequences of the pqcd chromo - fluid flow .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "[ pqcdmach ] was obtained using the source of section [ secsourceqcd ] integrated into the hydrodynamical code used in section [ sechydro ] .",
    "the associated heavy quark jet is created in the beginning of the hydro evolution @xmath222 at @xmath223 fm and the freeze - out is done when the it reaches the origin of the coordinates , independently of the heavy quark s velocity ( note that we do not include the trigger jet in our analysis ) .",
    "this provides a very rough description of the case in which a very energetic heavy quark punches through the medium .    comparing fig .",
    "[ pqcdmach ] with fig .",
    "[ adscftmach ] it is apparent that the qualitative features displayed by both of these systems are very similar .",
    "in particular , both systems exhibit the mach - like behavior when the distance from the source @xmath224 .",
    "the transverse flow in the neck region , however , is considerably smaller in pqcd in comparison to the ads result found in section [ secfreezeads ] .",
    "we then expect , based on the study in section [ secfreezeads ] , that the pqcd produced mach cones are _ not _ observable .",
    "we present normalized cf azimuthal distribution in the form of eq .",
    "[ coopermach ] in fig .",
    "[ cfplot ] .",
    "we computed @xmath225 for @xmath157 in a static uniform background .",
    "the results for the azimuthal angular correlations for @xmath226 gev , and @xmath227 are shown in fig .",
    "[ cfplot ] .",
    "the pqcd angular distribution shows only a sharp peak at @xmath228 for all velocities while the ads / cft distribution displays the double - peak structure for all velocities shown in fig .",
    "[ cfads ] .",
    "note , once again , that the peaks in the ads / cft correlation functions do not obey mach s law since they do not come from the far - away linearized region .",
    "the smaller transverse flow of the neck produced by the pqcd source term ensures that the mach contribution is washed out by the cooper - frye thermal smearing .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that mach cones _ in the fluid phase of the system _ are a generic prediction of a medium characterized by low viscosity and a high opacity to hard probes .",
    "however , the signal seen in the experiment is likely to be considerably different from the naive expectation both because of the medium - induced thermal smearing at freeze - out and the presence of additional structures such as the diffusion wake .",
    "we have illustrated these issues using examples taken from ads / cft and pqcd and shown that the critical requirement for a `` mach - cone like signal '' is in fact the presence of a strong transverse flow in the _ non - linear unthermalized _ neck region close to the source since this is most likely to survive freeze - out and yield a cone - like signal .",
    "however , the formation of strong transverse flow in the neck region is far from assured .",
    "for instance , it is prominent in the ads / cft solution and missing in pqcd .",
    "our analysis is far from complete .",
    "the most obvious physical aspects it misses are the underlying transverse flow ( probably significant at timescales relevant to jet absorption ) , coalescence dynamics ( certainly significant at momenta comparable to the away - side correlation used by experiment ) , and the dynamics of the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "efforts in this direction are ongoing @xcite and more studies are needed before a conclusive link between the experimental result and the theory can be made .",
    "whille the mach cone interpretations @xcite of conical correlations are intriguing and have focused attention on moderate pt correlation observables , the observed conical correlations will only fulfill its promise as a unique probe of the sqgp dynamics and its coupling to hard probes when the many remaining open problems and caveats discussed above are resolved .",
    "this effort is certainly warranted given the potential power of such correlation observables to resolve dynamical features inaccessible with well studied and measured inclusive and bulk flow observables .",
