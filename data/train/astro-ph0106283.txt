    "accretion onto compact objects is generally possible only if specific angular momentum is somehow extracted from fluid elements .",
    "it is now known that magnetic fields in a differentially rotating fluid cause a breakdown of laminar flow into turbulence ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) , and that this turbulence leads to a much enhanced angular momentum transport . despite the fact that turbulence is to some extent amenable to detailed numerical simulation , the theory of turbulent transport lacks a good phenomenological description .",
    "it may well be that one does not exist .    to make progress , some form of idealization is usually necessary , and a common approach has been the following : the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulent transport is modeled as an enhanced navier - stokes viscosity in an _",
    "unmagnetized _ fluid .",
    "the idea is that the flow of this ansatz hydrodynamical fluid may then be subject to further instabilities . in particular ,",
    "the enhanced viscosity is also an energy source , and heating in the inner regions of some types of accretion flow leads , it is argued , to a convectively - unstable temperature gradient .",
    "it has been further argued that , much like stellar convective zones , the flow would quickly evolve to a state of marginal stability .",
    "proponents of these convection - dominated accretion flows ( ` cdafs ' ) suggest that this process explains the very low x - ray luminosities associated with many black - hole candidates ( narayan , igumenschev , & abramowicz 2000 ) , because the _ inward _ angular momentum transport associated with thermal convection would precisely offset the usual outward mhd transport . in the stellar case ,",
    "marginal stability amounts to adopting an adiabatic temperature profile ; in an accretion flow matters are more complex , with constant entropy and angular momentum surfaces satisfying marginal stability by the hiland criterion ( quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) .",
    "we are therefore motivated to consider the equilibrium of a rotating , magnetized , hot dilute plasma .",
    "the results of this investigation may be surprising to the reader , because they are at odds with what has become a standard approach .",
    "our findings are relevant to understanding current problems in x - ray accretion sources , but they are also of general fluid dynamical interest . they are easily stated : ( 1 ) in a rotating , stratified , dilute plasma , the presence of any magnetic field and any coulomb - based thermal conductivity renders the classical hiland criteria insufficient for flow stability ( to axisymmetric disturbances ) .",
    "maximum growth rates are rapid ( dynamical time scale ) , and insensitive to the field strength and the value of the conductivity .",
    "( 2 ) where entropy ( @xmath0 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath1 ) gradients appear in the classical hiland formulae , they must be replaced with temperature ( @xmath2 ) and angular velocity ( @xmath3 ) gradients . _",
    "spherical adiabatic accretion is unstable . _",
    "( 3 ) convective instability is inseparable from rotational instability , in the sense that the breakdown of laminar flow into turbulent eddies and the formation of convective eddies are inseparable processes , governed by identical intertwined criteria .",
    "marginal stability is no more likely to be attained in advection - dominated type flows than it is in disks .",
    "indeed , it is the departure from marginal stability that is critical for maintaining vigorous turbulent transport , transport which is at once affected by the dynamical and the thermal properties of the flow .",
    "the following section presents a detailed development of these results , and the final section of this paper discusses some the consequences for understanding the stability of hot plasma winds and accretion flows .",
    "the appearance of @xmath3 and @xmath2 gradients as stability discriminants has fundamental significance .",
    "they strongly destabilize classically stable flows . before entering a technical discussion , it is desirable to have a physical understanding of how this arises in some illustrative cases .    in figure",
    "( 1 ) , we contrast the stability behavior of rotating fluid elements in an unmagnetized ( 1a ) and magnetized ( 1b ) medium . in the unmagnetized case",
    ", the fluid element retains its angular momentum @xmath4 on its epicyclic excursion .",
    "the angular momentum of an undisturbed orbit at the new location is @xmath5 .",
    "the rayleigh criterion for stability is simply @xmath6 , so that the displaced element would drop back to a lower orbit .",
    "this means that the angular momentum in the disk increases outward .",
    "the magnetized medium is distinguished by magnetically tethered fluid elements , which enforces isorotation at marginal stability , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "now the criterion for stability ( angular momentum less than surroundings ) is @xmath8 .",
    "hence , a magnetized disk requires that the angular velocity , not the angular momentum , increase outward for stability .",
    "this is the magnetorotational stability criterion .",
    "figure ( 2 ) shows the configuration appropriate to a thermally stratified medium . in the unmagnetized case ( 2a )",
    ", the fluid element retains its entropy @xmath9 as it is displaced .",
    "the entropy of the undisturbed layer at the element s new location is @xmath10 .",
    "the schwarzschild criterion for stability is @xmath11 , which is just the condition for the blob to be denser than its ( pressure - equilibrium ) surroundings .",
    "this means the entropy increases upwards .    in the magnetized case ( 2b ) , the displaced fluid element draws magnetic field lines up with it , and the temperature gradient now has a component along the displaced field line .",
    "heat flows along this direction from the hotter to the cooler element . under conditions of marginal stability",
    ", thermal conduction maintains a constant temperature between the fluid elements .",
    "the criterion for buoyant stability is now @xmath12 .",
    "a magnetized medium requires that the temperature , not the angular momentum , increase upward for stability .",
    "we shall now show that the classical hiland criteria are simply but significantly modified to accommodate these new stability criteria .      in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "heat is restricted to flowing along lines of magnetic force , provided that the ion larmor radius is much less than the collisional mean free path ( e.g. braginskii 1965 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to _ ci1 where @xmath13 is the ion cyclotron frequency , and @xmath14 is the mean free collision time .",
    "this inequality is generally satisfied by dilute astrophysical plasmas . under these circumstances ,",
    "the electron heat conduction parallel to the magnetic field is given by = - ( ) t_e where @xmath15 is the electron conductivity ( spitzer 1962 ) , 610 ^ -7 t_e^5/2  ergs cm^-1 k^-1 , and @xmath16 is the electron temperature .",
    "@xmath17 is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "unless otherwise explicitly stated , we shall assume that the ions and electrons have the same temperature @xmath2 .",
    "this amounts to requiring that the mean free path @xmath18 and the flow scale height @xmath19 satisfy @xmath20 ( cowie and mckee 1977 ) , or 10 ^ 4 t^2n h 1 .",
    "the usual fluid equations for a monotomic plasma are + ( ) = 0 , [ mom ] + ( ) = - ( p + b^28 ) - + ( 4 ) , = , = - = .",
    "these are respectively mass conservation , the equation of motion , the induction equation , and the entropy equation .",
    "our notation is standard : @xmath21 is the fluid velocity , @xmath22 the mass density , @xmath23 the gas pressure , @xmath24 the magnetic field , and @xmath25 the gravitational potential .",
    "the ion - dominated viscosity is ignored , as it is smaller than the conductivity by a factor of order the square root of the electron - to - ion mass ratio .",
    "( this assumes equal ion and electron temperatures . )",
    "the plasma is taken to be a perfect electrical conductor .",
    "we assume that in the equilibrium solution , the field lines are isotherms",
    ". then the linearly perturbed heat flux is = - ( ) t - ( ) t. perturbed quantities have the wkb space - time dependence @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the axisymmetric wavevector @xmath28 .",
    "we shall work in the boussinesq limit , and the linearly perturbed equations are therefore = 0 , + = ^2 p -1 ( p + 4 ) + ( ) 4 , = + , - p^-5/3 = 23p .",
    "in explicit component form , the leading order wkb equations are [ divv ] k_r v_r + k_z v_z = 0 , @xmath29 - i v_+ v_r 1r(r^2 ) r+ v_z rz -i b_4 = 0 , @xmath30 [ indr ] - i b_r - i v_r = 0 , - i b_- b_r r - b_z r z - i v_= 0 , [ indz ] - i b_z - i v_z = 0 , [ lincon ] i 53 + p^-5/3 = 23p ( i ( ) t - ^2 t ) .",
    "note that the change in the unit vector @xmath17 is [ delb ] = ( ) .",
    "these equations differ from the _ adiabatic _ magnetized hiland criteria studied by balbus ( 1995 , hereafter b95 ) only in the final energy equation ( [ lincon ] ) , which contains a rather complicated - looking conduction term . despite the apparent complexity",
    ", the fact that only the energy equation has changed allows us to simplify considerably our calculation of the dispersion relation , by making use of the b95 result .",
    "begin by setting @xmath31 in the conduction term , which is an implementation of the boussinesq approximation ( relative changes in the pressure are much smaller than relative changes in the temperature or density ) .",
    "then , substituting for @xmath32 from equation ( [ delb ] ) , and remembering that the field lines are isothermal , brings us to ( i - 25tp ^2 ) = - 35 p^-5/3 + 2it5p b t. using equations ( [ indr ] ) , ( [ indz ] ) and ( [ divv ] ) , then simplifying , leads to [ crux ] = v_r i   p^-5/3 , where = ( k_rk_z  z -  r ) , and @xmath33 is defined _ in situ . _    equation ( [ crux ] ) has two important limiting forms .",
    "when @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we recover the adiabatic expression [ adiab ] = v_r i p^-5/3 = - _",
    "r   p^-5/3 , where we have introduced the radial lagrangian fluid displacement , @xmath36 .",
    "this returns the calculation to b95 . but note the result obtained if we first take the limit @xmath37 , followed by @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath33 is proportional to the ratio of the temperature - to - entropy @xmath38 gradients , and [ nadiab ] = -_r   d t. this implies that the @xmath39 limit of the dispersion relation is simply obtained by taking the b95 result and replacing @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "since the @xmath39 limit is relevant for flow stability , comparison of equations ( [ adiab ] ) and ( [ nadiab ] ) points to something remarkable : the stability of the flow changes discontinuously when any finite thermal conductivity is present . instead of entropy gradients serving as the discriminant for buoyant stability , temperature gradients are key .",
    "if the temperature  _ not _ the entropy  decreases upwards , the plasma will become buoyantly unstable .",
    "this is a very big difference indeed , implying that simple adiabatic stratification ( or flow ) is unstable ( balbus 2000 ) .",
    "it is wholly analogous to the replacement of angular momentum gradients with angular velocity gradients in a magnetized rotator , and the accompanying destabilization of keplerian flow .",
    "the above reasoning suggests a simple way to obtain the desired dispersion relation : use @xmath33 as a `` tag , '' and substitute @xmath42 for @xmath43 where it appears as a prefactor in equation ( 2.4 ) in b95 .",
    "this prescription gives directly @xmath44 - 4 \\omega^2 ( { {    \\mbox{\\boldmath{$k\\cdot v_a$ } }   }   } ) ^2 = 0,\\ ] ] where = / , ^2 = ^2 - ( ) ^2 , k^2 = k_r^2 + k_z^2 .",
    "we may now expand this equation using ( [ crux ] ) , introducing @xmath45 to keep the dispersion coefficients real .",
    "one finds : @xmath46 - 4 \\omega^2 ( { {    \\mbox{\\boldmath{$k\\cdot v_a$ } }   }   } ) ^2\\sigma_{cond }   = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now ^2 = ^2 + ( ) ^2 , _ cond = + 2t5p ( ) ^2 this is the general form of the dispersion relation .",
    "the marginal stability of purely evanescent modes may be studied very simply by passing through the point @xmath47 .",
    "the condition for stability is [ stbcond ] ( ) ^2k^2k_z^2 -1(dp ) ( dt ) -1r^3 d(r^4 ^ 2 ) - 4 ^ 2 > 0 .",
    "note that this condition is independent of the conductivity @xmath15 , for any finite value of this parameter . by way of contrast , when @xmath48 , the @xmath49 result is ( ) ^2k^2k_z^2 -35(dp ) ( dp^-5/3 ) -1r^3",
    "d(r^4 ^ 2 ) - 4 ^ 2 > 0 , which is the same as the previous condition , except for the replacement of a logarithmic temperature gradient by an entropy gradient .",
    "the condition ( [ stbcond ] ) is actually much more general than the above simple derivation would suggest .",
    "it is in fact a necessary and sufficient condition to preclude both instability and overstability .",
    "this is established in detail in the appendix by use of the routh - hurwitz criterion .    at this point of the calculation",
    ", the route becomes identical to b95 , and the stability criteria are obtained by direct substitution of @xmath50 for @xmath40 in equations ( 2.9 ) and ( 2.11 ) of that paper .",
    "for ease of reference and cross comparison , we give three forms of the hiland stability criteria , and the conditions under which they are valid :    the textbook case ( tassoul 1978 ) is adiabatic and unmagnetized .",

    "the combined effect of a magnetic field and coulomb conductivity is to ensure that free energy sources ( angular velocity and temperature gradients ) control flow stability .",
    "this result goes some way toward understanding why minimal energy and maximal entropy states of bound systems are associated with uniform rotation and isothermality , yet the classical dynamical stability criteria involve gradients of angular momentum and entropy .",
    "departures from uniform rotation and isothermality are indeed a source of dynamical instability .",
    "it is just that magnetic tension and magnetically confined conduction are needed to provide the right coupling to tap into these sources .        because of the apparent generality of the criteria ( [ hoil1 ] ) and ( [ hoil2 ] ) , it is important to emphasize the point ( balbus 2000 ) that the destabilizing role of thermal conduction is modified substantially when diffusivity is dominated by radiative processes , as in stellar interiors",
    "this form of the heat conduction is indifferent to the magnetic field .",
    "denoting the radiative conductivity as @xmath51 , we have ( schwarzschild 1958 ) : _ rad = 16t^33 , where @xmath52 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath53 is the radiative opacity .",
    "when both coulomb and radiative conductivity are present , the right hand side of equation ( [ lincon ] ) is modified to .",
    "( we assume , as before , that unperturbed field lines are isothermal .",
    "our ultimate conclusion is not strongly affected by this assumption . )",

    "the stability condition ( [ stbcond ] ) becomes ( ) ^2k^2k_z^2 - -1r^3 d(r^4 ^ 2 ) - 4 ^ 2 > 0 . by reducing the effective size of the potentially destabilizing temperature gradient",
    ", radiative conductivity is strongly stabilizing .",
    "even when formally present , instability occurs primarily at long wavelengths ( along the field lines ) when radiative conduction is dominant , and the local wkb approximation we have been using breaks down . when unstable wavelengths are calculated to be in excess of the size of the system , the question of stability must be determined by a global analysis .",
    "the dynamical stability of stellar radiative interiors , therefore , is not threatened by this analysis ( balbus 2000 ) .",
    "the development of a local instability in an evolving , dynamically active background is more complex than the analogous problem for a static equilibrium ( e.g. balbus & soker 1989 ) . both accretion flows and winds are a natural venue for the instabilities of interest , but we shall defer a detailed study of the dynamical linear stability theory to a separate investigation ( balbus 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "it is nevertheless both possible and useful to make some simple statements of a general nature .",
    "we restrict our comments to spherical flow .    at @xmath55 , label each fluid element by a position vector @xmath56 , which is a lagrangian coordinate system , comoving with the unperturbed flow .",
    "the position vector @xmath57 is the instantaneous eulerian coordinate of a fluid element as it flows .",
    "radial stretching of the flow is characterized by the scale factor @xmath58 which is a sort of hubble parameter .",
    "the fundamental perturbation variable in a dynamical flow is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the radial displacement of a perturbed fluid element relative to the undisturbed flow .",
    "note that we normalize @xmath60 relative to @xmath61 , since the latter tracks the relative separation of two points in the underlying flow .",
    "displacements relative to @xmath61 track true , physical changes .",
    "if the growth rate of an embedded instability is rapid compared with the background flow evolution , the resulting form for @xmath59 is rather intuitive : [ growth ] ( ^t ( t ) dt ) , where @xmath62 is the value of the instantaneous growth rate obtained by ignoring background flow at the fluid element s position at time @xmath63 . in a spherical system , it is not difficult to show that the most rapidly growing thermal mode corresponds to ^2 = - 1 prtr , which is likely to be of order the sound crossing time . in other words , when the background flow is subsonic , one expects only small quantitative changes in the development of a perturbation from static theory .",
    "the breakdown starts to occur when the flow becomes sonic .",
    "then , there is only one time scale in the problem , and the integral in ( [ growth ] ) becomes logarithmic , with power law behavior for the perturbations .",
    "once the flow becomes highly supersonic , there is a complete breakdown of the wkb form ( [ growth ] ) .",
    "generally , such disturbances are `` inflated away , '' and in any case can not make contact with upstream fluid .",
    "applications of the dispersion relation or the stability criteria to dynamically active flows should be restricted to their subsonic zones .",
    "the understanding that temperature and angular velocity gradients regulate flow stability in magnetized dilute plasmas has important consequences . when rotation is unimportant , isothermal , not adiabatic",
    ", conditions should prevail .",
    "this should be true whether or not field lines are free to open up .",
    "marginal stability is a likely outcome , since the temperature profile is free to adjust itself while maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "one interesting application is to x - ray gas in early - type galaxies .",
    "fabian et al . ( 1986 ) show that the classical schwarzschild stability criterion implies a minimum mass contained within a confining outer radius @xmath64 of m , where @xmath65 is the isothermal sound speed at observed radius @xmath66 , at the pressures @xmath67 and @xmath68 are those at @xmath64 and @xmath66 .",
    "this constraint may be further tightened with the isothermal criterion to m , which also has the added advantage of being rather insensitive to the pressures .",
    "( note that classical cooling flows are not affected by this instability , as the temperature increases outward when radiative losses are important . )    when application is made to a rotating systems , the notion of marginal stability is often inappropriate , for the simple reason that the system may not have the option of changing its rotation law .",
    "in keplerian disks , the instability reduces to the magnetorotational instability , and that is hardly a marginally stable flow .",
    "more contemporary examples are adafs ( narayan , mahadevan , & quataert 1998 for a review ) , and cdafs ( narayan et al .",
    "2000 ) , which were mentioned briefly in the introduction .",
    "the latter are particularly striking , as proponents argue that convection itself is capable of suppressing accretion , i.e. that inward convective angular momentum very nearly cancels the outward transport of mhd turbulence .",
    "this is a rather bold extrapolation from earlier numerical simulations ( stone & balbus 1996 , cabot 1996 ) , which suggest an effective @xmath69 value some three orders of magnitude smaller than that obtained from the magnetorotational instability .",
    "convective turbulence tends to create velocity - temperature correlations that ( not surprisingly ) do a fine job of transporting heat , and a very poor job of transporting angular momentum .",
    "recent mhd simulations of resistively - heated , non - radiative , quasi - spherical accretion flows ( stone & pringle 2001 ) show no evidence of convective stalling .",
    "part of the difficulty of ascribing a special role to convective angular momentum transport may be grasped from the form of the stability criteria appropriate to these flows , equations ( [ hoil1 ] ) and ( [ hoil2 ] ) .",
    "cdaf proponents use , incorrectly , the classical hiland criteria ( [ hoilad1 ] ) and ( [ hoilad2 ] ) . among other problems",
    ", this has the effect of masking the dominant magnetorotational instability , which ultimately governs the nature of the angular momentum transport .",
    "the formal epicyclic frequency ( the term proportional to the angular momentum gradient in [ [ hoilad1 ] ] ) is real - valued in the flows of interest , and gives no hint of rotational instability .",
    "only the adverse entropy gradients , which are clearly associated with convection , would seem to be involved with instability .",
    "but this is very misleading .",
    "the appropriate form of the instability criteria ( [ hoil1 ] ) and ( [ hoil2 ] ) tell a much different story .",
    "the point that the thermally driven component is governed by temperature , not entropy , gradients is a relatively minor one in this context .",
    "( for this reason , we need not concern ourselves here with the possible complexities of a two - temperature plasma . )",
    "much more important is the conceptual point that convective and rotational instability must be treated on the same footing .",
    "there is no separate `` viscous '' angular momentum transport and `` convective '' angular momentum transport , any more than there is turbulent transport and magnetic transport .",
    "there is a rotationally driven mhd instability that gives rise to a turbulent stress tensor , and there is nothing marginally unstable about the flow . as mentioned above , stone & pringle ( 2001 )",
    "have performed two - dimensional calculations that bear this out ; preliminary three - dimensional simulations are equally supportive ( hawley , balbus , & stone 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "it is , nevertheless , of great interest to understand the mhd _ thermal _ properties of nonrotating ( or uniformly rotating ) flows .",
    "what are the numerical prospects for studying the thermoclinic instability in nonrotating systems ?",
    "it is a daunting task , because thermal conduction along magnetic field lines must be isolated , uncontaminated by numerical cross - field diffusion . when the field becomes highly tangled",
    ", computations become prohibitive .",
    "even at this early stage of inquiry , something can be done .",
    "the linear instability in a simple vertically stratified box with a weak horizontal field can be demonstrated under schwarzschild stable conditions ( stone 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "it is even possible to see the early stages of nonlinear instability , as shown in figure [ 3 ] .",
    "if the effect of the instability is generally to comb field lines out , then it may well be possible to make further progress on the numerical front . either by field line combing or by convection",
    ", the tendency toward isothermality of a bottom - hot dilute stratified plasma seems a likely outcome .",
    "the results of this paper should make very clear the important conceptual point that even the tiniest of magnetic fields can have dramatic consequences for the macroscopic stability of astrophysical plasmas .",
    "classical hydrodynamical results can be qualitatively incorrect , and great care must be taken before uncritically taking them over into magnetized systems .",
    "subtlety need not imply great complexity : the relative simplicity of our fundamental results , equations ( [ hoil1 ] ) and ( [ hoil2 ] ) , is encouragement that the most important mhd stability properties can also be conceptually simple . and since it seems certain that the final word has not been said on the topic , more surprises are likely .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank j.  hawley and c.  terquem for detailed comments on a preliminary draft of this paper which led to significant improvements in the presentation , and m.  fall for pointing out to me that the new stability criteria sharpen dark matter constraints in x - ray clusters .",

    "to prove that the condition ( [ stbcond ] ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for any type of instability , we first expand the polynomial in equation ( 29 ) in the form [ poly ] a_0 ^ 5 + a_1 ^ 4 + a_2 ^ 3 + a_3 ^ 2 + a_4+a_5 = 0 . where a_0 = k^2/k_z^2 , a_1 = ( ) ^2 , a_2 = 2 ( ) ^2 - pp^-5/3 - ( r^4 ^ 2 ) , a_3 = ( ) ^2 , a_4= ( ) ^2 , a_5= ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2 .",
    "to make things more compact and manageable , notice that - pp^-5/3 + pt = ( d p)^2 > 0 , and if we furthermore define ( k^2/k_z^2 ) ( ) ^2 + 4 ^ 2 > 0 , then we may write [ aaa ] a_3 = ( ) ^2 ( a_2 - ) , a_4 = ( ) ^2 ( a_2 - ) , a_5 = ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2 ( a_2 - - ) .    for stability",
    ", we require that the real part of @xmath52 must be less than zero , i.e. , that the roots of equation ( [ poly ] ) must all lie in the left complex @xmath52 plane .",
    "polynomials with this property are known as _ hurwitz _ polynomials ( e.g. levinson & redheffer 1970 ) .",
    "if the left side of equation ( [ poly ] ) is a hurwitz polynomial , both pure exponential instability as well as overstability are precluded",

    "the requirement that the left side of equation ( [ poly ] ) be a hurwitz polynomial may then be succinctly stated as [ hurwitz ] ( n ) > 0 , n=1,2 ... 5 .",
    "this is the routh - hurwitz criterion .",
    "the criterion ( [ stbcond ] ) in the text amounts to the condition @xmath73 , which follows directly from the two demands @xmath74 and @xmath75 . we shall now prove that the general routh - hurwitz criterion is satisfied for our dispersion relation .",
    "brackets is just ( a_2 - - ) + 4 ^ 2 + ( ) ^2 ( -1 ) . according to equation ( [ aaa ] ) , the sum of the first three grouped terms must be positive if @xmath77 , and the remaining two terms are each manifestly positive . hence @xmath78 .",
