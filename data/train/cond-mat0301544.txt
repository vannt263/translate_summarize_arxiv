    "recent attempts to cool down a trapped gas of fermionic atoms , such as @xmath3k @xcite or @xmath4li @xcite , have reached temperatures below the fermi temperature . degenerate *  *",
    "atomic fermi gases offer the intriguing possibility to create a paired fermion state such as a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer phase in a novel and highly controllable system .",
    "however , until *  * now the temperatures obtained in the experiments with ultracold fermionic atoms are not low enough to observe such phenomena . in this paper , we propose a straightforward description of the cooling mechanism , discuss its inherent limitations , and we investigate strategies to alter the cooling procedure in order to achieve lower temperatures .",
    "the cooling process used to create bose - einstein condensates in trapped bosonic gases is evaporative cooling , whereby the most energetic atoms are removed from the gas , leaving the remnant colder after rethermalization .",
    "however , due to the antisymmetrization requirement of the fermionic wave function , identical fermionic atoms can not undergo the @xmath5-wave collisions necessary for rethermalization , and thus they can not be directly cooled using evaporative cooling .",
    "this problem was circumvented by simultaneously trapping two atom species or two different hyperfine spin states of a given atom species . in @xcite , @xmath4li is trapped together with its bosonic isotope @xmath6li . whereas the @xmath5-wave scattering length of @xmath7li is zero by symmetry , the @xmath5-wave scattering length for a collision between a @xmath4li and a @xmath6li atom is 2.2 nm , which is enough to thermalize both species together .",
    "this version of evaporative cooling is denominated ` sympathetic cooling ' .",
    "we describe the sympathetic cooling process , using the three - fluid model presented in sec .",
    "ii , as a sequence of evaporation and rethermalization steps so that in the evaporation steps the energetic atoms are removed from the mixture and in the rethermalization steps the new ( lower ) equilibrium temperature is reached , as explained in sec .",
    "the results obtained with this model are discussed in sec .",
    "iv , and an improvement on the current sympathetic cooling process is proposed to reach lower temperatures ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) .",
    "the trapped system which will be subjected to sympathetic cooling consists of @xmath10 bosons with mass @xmath11 and scattering length @xmath12 ; and @xmath13 fermions with mass @xmath14 , all at initial temperature @xmath15 in a parabolic trap with trapping frequency @xmath16 and characteristic length _  _",
    "the scattering length for a collision between a boson and a fermion will be denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "the three - fluid model @xcite distinguishes the fermion gas , the bose - einstein condensed ( bec ) bosons and the non - condensed or ` thermal ' bosons .",

    "we have experimented using the maxwell - boltzman distribution instead of a bose - einstein distribution in the expressions for the density ( [ nt ] ) and the energy ( [ et ] ) . in the experiment , this approximation is routinely performed in order to determine the temperature of a trapped atomic gas by fitting the maxwell - boltzman distribution to the tail of the measured velocity distribution or density profile .",
    "also in our calculations , we found that the maxwell - boltzman distribution provides an accurate description of the thermal bosons .",
    "we describe the cooling process as a two - step process .",
    "the first step is the _ evaporative stage _ , whereby either just the bosons can be ` evaporated ' , or just the fermions , or both bosons and fermions .",
    "the effect of the evaporative stage is truncating the radial distribution by removing the outer atoms .",
    "the energy of these atoms is higher than the average energy of the mixture and so this removal allows us to obtain a lower temperature .",
    "the second step is the _ rethermalization stage _",
    ", where the collisions between the bosons and between bosons and fermions bring the truncated ( non - equilibrium ) distribution obtained in the evaporative stage into a new equilibrium distribution",
    ". this new equilibrium distribution will be at a lower temperature if the atoms removed have more energy than the average atom energy .",
    "we will describe the sympathetic cooling as a discrete succession of evaporation and rethermalization stages .",
    "in reality , the evaporation and rethermalization goes on simultaneously .",
    "however , previous studies have shown that the discrete treatment of the cooling process provides an accurate description @xcite .    the _ evaporation _ is realized by a radiofrequent ( or microwave ) field which induces a transition between the trapped hyperfine state of a selected atom species and an untrapped hyperfine state .",
    "the frequency suited  for this transition depends on the distance from the atom to the center of the trap , due to the zeeman effect of the spatially varying magnetic trapping field . by tuning the frequency , atoms that are beyond a cut - off distance @xmath42 from the center of the trap are removed .",

    "note that evaporating the bose - einstein condensed bosons will not lead to cooling .",
    "the bose - einstein condensed bosons are always the lowest - energetic bosons in the mixtures - removing them would only lead to heating of the system .",
    "thus it is important that the cut - off distance @xmath47 is larger than the thomas - fermi radius of the condensate .    the evaporative stage results in a new total number of bosons @xmath48 , and a new total energy @xmath49 , if only bosons are removed from the trap .",
    "if also fermions are evaporated , @xmath46 has to be subtracted too , and @xmath50 is the new number of fermions . using the equations ( [ vc])-([ebf ] ) , the new system parameters @xmath51 are expressed as a function of the new temperature @xmath52 and the new chemical potentials @xmath53 and @xmath54 . the new temperature and chemical potentials are then solved from these equations . after this rethermalization stage , a new evaporative stage can be initiated .",
    "losses due to three - body collisions lead to heating , since the three - body collisions will be prominent in the condensate which harbors the coldest atoms .",

    "the cut - off radius was decreased by @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "an *  * optimal radius exists around 18 @xmath74 , which is small enough to remove enough bosons , but sufficiently large in order not to remove too many bosons in the initial steps and not being energy selective .",
    "the simulations have a *  * maximum of *  * 50 steps or stop when the cut - off radius becomes smaller than the condensate . in figure [ figure4 ]",
    "we investigate how the temperature obtained by cooling is affected by reducing the cut - off *  * radius with different amounts during the cooling process . at each time step , the cut - off *  * radius is decreased by a size @xmath76 .",
    "the different curves in the figure show the temperature as a function of time ( step in the cooling process ) at different values of @xmath76 .",
    "we find that a faster rate of decrease *  * of the radius leads to a faster cooling , but that no lower temperatures can be reached .",
    "if the radius is decreased too fast , it reaches the radius of the condensate too soon , and the cooling process is stopped . for a fixed time of the cooling process , which is determined by the loss rate of the trap , an optimal value of @xmath76 can be determined .",
    "for the 50 steps that we took in figure [ figure4 ] , this is @xmath76 between 0.32 and 0.6 trap *  * oscillator lengths .",
    "figure [ figure5 ] shows the dependence of the temperature on the initial number of bosons , keeping the number of fermions fixed .",
    "we find the counterintuitive result that the initial ratio between bosons and fermions has only a minor effect on the final temperature that can be reached : it is always around 0.2 @xmath2 .",
    "this can be understood by noticing that the number of thermal bosons ( which are responsible for the cooling ) is almost independent of the total number of bosons for temperatures below the condensation temperature .",
    "( @xmath77 ) .",
    "truscott _ et al . _",
    "@xcite note that the cooling process seems to stall as soon as the specific heat of the bosons is smaller than the specific heat of the fermions , because the energy which can be carried away by evaporating a bosonic atom then becomes smaller than the energy of a fermionic atom .",
    "this result is confirmed by the present simulation , which explains why the final temperature is insensitive to the initial ratio of bosons to fermions .",
    "basically , when the number of thermal bosons is small compared to @xmath78 , the energy which can be carried away by evaporating the bosons is small compared to the energy of the fermi gas .",
    "the temperature does not decrease significantly and the bosons are quickly lost , because the spatial extent of the cloud remains big .",
    "this leads us to suggest another cooling process .",
    "when evaporative cooling by removing bosons has led to a final temperature , and continued evaporation of the bosons no longer leads to substantial further cooling , we suggest to switch to evaporating the fermions , or fermions and bosons .",
    "removing the bosons from the trap does not cool the system any more because the bosons can no longer carry away the necessary energy - but the fermions still can .",
    "assume that by the evaporation of bosons , the temperature has already decreased to @xmath79 @xmath80 and there are @xmath81 and @xmath82 atoms left in the trap .",
    "this system is experimentally achievable by evaporating bosons alone .",
    "figure [ figure6 ] shows the resulting temperature as a function of time , after switching from evaporating the bosons to evaporating only the fermions .",
    "the cut - off radius was chosen at @xmath83 @xmath74 and decreases each time step . in this way",
    "the temperature can be lowered to @xmath84 @xmath85 as also illustrated in the figure , the number of bosons has almost no influence on the cooling process .    losses due to three particle collisions involving two bosons and one fermion is expected to limit the achievable temperature , as pointed out by timmermans @xcite . the effect of this type of loss can be investigated in the present formalism in the same way as the effect of the three - boson collisions .",
    "the results are shown in the inset of figure 6 , for a cooling process starting with @xmath86 bosons and @xmath86 fermions .",
    "the different curves correspond to different values of the three particle recombination constant @xmath87 .",
    "if the product of the time to achieve equilibrium ( @xmath57 ) and the recombination constant is @xmath88  we find that the lowest achievable temperature is raised by less than @xmath89 @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath90 there is no appreciable effect on the final temperature of the cooling process .",
    "we have proposed a versatile , and straightforwardly implementable three - fluid model to describe the sympathetic cooling of bosons and fermions .",
    "our model reproduces well the cooling observed in an experiment with @xmath4li and @xmath6li , and we find that the final temperature @xmath91 which is reached is not sensitive to the initial ratio of the number of bosons to the number of fermions .",
    "lower temperatures can be reached if the stage where the only the bosonic atoms are evaporated is followed by a stage where also the fermionic atoms are evaporated .",
    "when this procedure is applied , a temperature of @xmath92 could be reached , which in combination with the tunability of the interaction strength through the feshbach resonance , brings the fermi gas closer to temperatures where pairing may be observed .",
