    "hints for not so small @xmath8 in the neutrino sector have been recently confirmed by analyses of global neutrino data , including the latest t2k @xcite and minos @xcite results , providing @xmath9 at 3@xmath1 cl @xcite . this has triggered a lot of attention in the community , aimed at explaining how",
    "such relatively large values can naturally be obtained in a consistent model for fermion masses and mixings .",
    "attempts in this direction have been done , for instance , in the context of gut theories @xcite , where corrections to the bimaximal or tri - bimaximal mixing were responsible for large deviation of @xmath8 from zero , or using some neutrino mass textures giving non - vanishing leading order reactor angle @xcite . in this paper",
    "we want to analyze the possibility to get sizable @xmath8 from broken @xmath2 flavour symmetry @xcite with charge @xmath3 for lepton doublets @xcite and arbitrary right - handed charges @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , in the limit of exact symmetry , neutrino masses and mixings are described by the following mass matrix : m_=m_0 (    ccc 0 & 1 & x + 1 & 0&0 + x & 0&0    ) , [ mass ] leading to a spectrum of inverted type , @xmath5 , @xmath10 ( i.e. large atmospheric mixing for @xmath11 ) and @xmath7 .",
    "a main problem of such texture is that two eigenvalues have the same absolute values , thus preventing the description of the solar mass difference . in this context ,",
    "successful tentatives to solve such problems have been presented in @xcite where , however , either the solar angle was too large compared to the current best fit point or the reactor angle was ( almost ) vanishing .",
    "corrections of order of the cabibbo angle @xmath12 from the charged lepton sector @xcite can simultaneously affect the deviation of @xmath13 from maximal mixing and of @xmath8 from zero , thus allowing a sizable reactor angle , but the question of how to naturally explain the smallness of the solar - to - atmospheric mass ratio @xmath14 ( without fine - tuning among the model parameters ) remained unanswered . in this paper",
    "we want to contribute to the discussion presenting a model where the previous issues are solved / mitigated .",
    "in particular , we work in a susy framework where the @xmath2 flavour symmetry is broken by the vevs of two complex fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 of charge @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we show in sect.[description ] that an appropriate breaking of the @xmath3 symmetry in the neutrino sector is enough to guarantee a value of @xmath19 ( and to preserve the leading order ( lo ) prediction of large @xmath20 ) but not to generate the necessary deviations for the solar and reactor angles .",
    "the corrections from the charged lepton sector are discussed in sect.[chlepsectr ] and their impact on the determination of the leptonic mixing angles is investigated in sect.[upmns ] , where we show that complex yukawa couplings are needed to make the model in agreement with the experimental data . in sect.5",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "the three families of @xmath4 lepton doublets @xmath21 are charged under the non - standard lepton number @xmath22 , with values : l_i~l_e - l_-l_~(1,-1,-1 ) . from the dimension 5 operators and in the limit of unbroken @xmath22 symmetry",
    ", the lo lagrangian can be written in the ( simplified ) form : ^lo = ( x_12 l_e l_+ x_13 l_e l _ ) h_u h_u + h.c .",
    ", where @xmath23 is a large mass scale , @xmath24 represents the ( uncharged ) higgs field and @xmath25 are generic @xmath26 coefficients , that we take as real from now on .",
    "the previous lagrangian gives rise to the neutrino mass matrix in eq.([mass ] ) , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is well know that such a matrix has two degenerate eigenvalues @xmath29 and a vanishing one @xmath30 ; the diagonalizing matrix can be cast in the following form : u_= (    ccc - & & 0 + & & - + & &    ) , [ rot ] from which @xmath31 , @xmath10 and @xmath32 . from the expressions of the atmospheric mass difference @xmath33",
    ", we easily get : x^2 = - 1 , so that , for a natural value @xmath34 ( needed also to fit the atmospheric angle ) we can fix the overall scale @xmath35 ev .    in order to split the solar mass difference and reproduce a correct value of @xmath14",
    ", we need to fill some of the vanishing matrix elements of eq.([mass ] ) with entries of appropriate order of magnitude . to this aim",
    ", it would be enough to assume that the @xmath2 symmetry is broken by the vev of one scalar field ; however , as it will be discussed at length in sect.[chlepsectr ] , we also want to generate a large @xmath8 ( and avoid large contributions to @xmath36 fro the charged lepton sector ) ; this forces to assume that the @xmath2 symmetry is broken by the vev of _ two _ fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 of charge @xmath17 and @xmath18 . to allow for non - vanishing vevs , we assume to work in the limit of exact susy ; in this case , the vev of the scalar fields are determined by setting to zero the corresponding scalar potential @xcite . for the flavon fields @xmath16 and @xmath15 , related to the froggatt - nielsen symmetry , the non vanishing vevs are determined by the d - term associated with the @xmath37 symmetry : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the gauge coupling constant of @xmath40 and @xmath41 denotes the contribution of the fayet - iliopoulos term ; the condition for having susy minima , @xmath42 , gives the relation for non - vanishing vev of the combination @xmath43 .",
    "it is then natural to assume a common order of magnitude for both vevs , @xmath44 , @xmath12 being the cabibbo angle . with this in mind ,",
    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contributions to the neutrino mass matrix come from : ^nlo = ( x_2^l_l _ + x_3^l_l _",
    "+ x_4^l_l _",
    "+ x_1^l_e l_e ) h_u h_u + h.c .",
    "so that m_=m_0 (    ccc x_1 ^4 & 1 & x + 1&x_2 ^2&x_3 ^2 + x & x_3 ^2&x_4 ^2    ) , [ invh1 ] with @xmath45 .",
    "we see that the charge of @xmath15 is needed to fill the 2 - 3 sub - block with entries of @xmath46 , whereas at the same order the contribution of the @xmath16 field is negligible . from standard perturbation theory",
    ", we get the following eigenvalues ( in units of @xmath47 ) : m_1 & = & + ^2 + m_2 & = & - + ^2 + m_3 & = & ^2 .",
    "notice that the corrections to @xmath48 are exactly the same .",
    "we can compute the small parameter @xmath49 in the limit of real parameters , obtaining : r= -2 ^2 . for @xmath26 parameters , a natural suppression of @xmath14 by @xmath50",
    "is achieved and the usual problem of having @xmath51 ( especially when using non - abelian groups with neutrinos in triplet representations ) is circumvented here .",
    "notice that the inverted mass ordering predicted by the model can be already tested after the second phase of the t2k experiment @xcite or , possibly , at future neutrino factories or @xmath52 beams @xcite .",
    "the normalized eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath53 and @xmath54 receive @xmath46 corrections whereas , at the same order , only the first component of the third eigenvector is modified compared to the unbroken limit .",
    "it it easy to extract the values of the mixing angles ( before the diagonalization of the charged leptons ) : ^_13&= & ^2 + ^_12&= & 1 + ^2 ~1 - [ resneu ] + ^_23&= & x .",
    "we see that , although the atmospheric angle is still of @xmath26 , the solar angle remains too large ( and always smaller than maximal mixing , due to the condition @xmath55 ) and that the reactor angle is as small as @xmath50 .",
    "the corrections from the charged lepton sector must be large , of @xmath56 , to shift both @xmath13 and @xmath8 closer to their recent best fit values @xcite while not destroying a large @xmath20 .",
    "notice that the rotation from such a sector also affects the radiative decays of muons and taus . in particular , the correction in the @xmath57 sector is the most relevant one and should be taken under control to avoid a large contribution to @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , it has been shown in @xcite and @xcite that , in a effective theory approach , the amplitudes for the radiative decays of the charged leptons depend on the off - diagonal elements of the dipole operator @xmath58 , in a basis where the mass matrix of the charged leptons is diagonal . in the case of @xmath36 ,",
    "the relevant matrix element is @xmath59 , suppressed by a cut - off scale and directly related to the @xmath57 charged lepton mixing . in susy theories ,",
    "if we want the cut - off scale at the level of @xmath60 1 tev , the @xmath57 mixing should be at least of @xmath46 to avoid a large @xmath59 and then a large @xmath36 branching ratio .",
    "this means that the deviations from @xmath5 can only originate from a different subsector of the charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "we start with a general consideration about the charged lepton rotation @xcite .",
    "let us define a generic @xmath61 mixing matrix in terms of rotations in three different subspaces : [ genericu ] u  =   (    1&0&0 0&c_23^e&s_23^e0&-s_23^e&c_23^e    ) (    c_13^e&0&s_13^e e^i 0&1&0-s_13^e e^-i&0&c_13^e    ) (    c_12^e&s_12^e&0 -s_12^e&c_12^e&00&0&1    ) . [ ufi ] where we used the superscript @xmath62 to identify the angles in the charged lepton sector . in the left - right basis",
    ", the mass matrix is diagonalized by a bi - unitary transformation : m_= u_l m_^d u_r^. using for @xmath63 the form in eq.([genericu ] ) and disregarding possible cp phases , we obtain : m_= (    c_12^e c_13^e m_e & s_12^e c_13^e m _",
    "& s_13^e m_m_e ( -c_23^e s_12^e - c_12^e s_13^e s_23^e ) & m_(c_12^e c_23^e - s_12^e s_13^e s_23^e ) & c_13^e",
    "s_23^e m_m_e ( -c_12^e c_23^e s_13^e + s_12^e s_23^e ) & m_(-c_23^e s_12^e s_13^e - c_12^e s_23^e ) & c_13^e c_23^e m _    ) u_r . the right - handed rotation is not involved in the neutrino mixing ; inspired by the minimal su(5 ) relation @xmath64 and by the fact that the ckm matrix is almost diagonal , we tentatively take @xmath65 .",
    "now we want to introduce in @xmath66 appropriate expressions for the masses and angles . according to the previous discussion ,",
    "the needed pattern of corrections are guarantee if we take @xmath67 to be smaller than @xmath46 and @xmath68 @xcite ; for the moment , we do not specify the value of the atmospheric angle .",
    "finally , we factorize out the @xmath69 mass from @xmath66 and use the mass ratios m_e : m _ : m_= ^5 : ^2 : 1 to get : [ emmee ] m_~m _",
    "(    ^5 & ^4 & ^6 & c_23^e^2 & s_23^e ^6 & -s_23^e^2&c_23^e    ) . by construction , this matrix provides a left - handed rotation of type ( taking only the leading contributions in @xmath12 ) : [ dian ] u_l ~ (    1 & ^2 & -s_23^e & c_23^e & s_23^e -c_23^e & -s_23^e & c_23^e    ) , which generates the wanted corrections to the solar and reactor angles while avoiding large contributions to @xmath36 .",
    "the peculiarity of such a matrix comes from the ( 2 - 3 ) sub - block , whose matrix elements are strongly correlated in terms of relative signs and magnitudes : in fact , there is only one independent element , dictated by the @xmath70 angle . if we were able to naturally obtain eq.([emmee ] ) , then the neutrino mixing angles , from @xmath71 , would have the following expressions ( disregarding @xmath46 corrections stemming from neutrino nlo corrections ) : [ belle1 ] _ 13 & ~&| | + _ 12&~ & 1 + 2 ( ) + _ 23 & ~ & || . for @xmath72 ( and still @xmath73 ) , we would get the good results : [ belle ] _ 13 & ~ & _ 12~1 + o ( ) _ 23 ~1 . however , the matrix in eq.([emmee ] ) is difficult to implement in models based on @xmath2 , which only allows to accommodate the order of magnitude of the matrix elements .",
    "moreover , as it will be clear later , in models with broken @xmath74 symmetry , the charges of the mass matrix elements @xmath75 and @xmath76 are exactly the same and we can not generate any hierarchy among them without invoking additional ingredients . in the following ,",
    "we then look for charge assignments of the right - handed fields which allow to reproduce a structure as similar as possible to eq.([emmee ] ) in terms of powers of @xmath12 ; this is as : [ emmee2 ] m_~ (    ^5 & ^4 & 0 & ^2 & 1 0 & ^2&1    ) .",
    "we emphasize that a matrix like eq.([emmee2 ] ) _ does not _ naturally produce mixing angles in agreement with eq.([belle1 ] ) .",
    "the operators contributing to the mass matrix are of the form : [ oper ] ( m_)_ij= a_ij l_il_j^c ( ) ^_ij()^_ijh_d ~a_ij l_il_j^c^_ij+_ij , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are positive integers controlling the suppression of each matrix element in terms of @xmath12 , with @xmath79 being the minimum allowed sum ( otherwise we would take into account higher order combinations of flavon fields ) and @xmath80 are complex @xmath26 coefficients .",
    "@xmath81 is taken to be uncharged . with the @xmath2 assignment for the leptons as : l_i~l_e - l_-l_~(1,-1,-1 ) + l^c ~(q_e , q _ , q _ ) [ assign ] , and reminding that @xmath82 and @xmath18 , the charges of the operators in eq.([oper ] ) are as follows : q_m_= (    ccc 1+q_e+_11 - _ 11 /2 & 1+q_+_12 - _ 12/2 & 1+q_+_13 - _ 13/2 + -1+q_e+_21 - _ 21/2 & -1+q_+_22 - _ 22/2 & -1+q_+_23 - _ 23/2 + -1+q_e+_21 - _ 21/2 & -1+q_+_22 - _ 22/2 & -1+q_+_23 - _ 23/2 +    ) .[melle2 ] notice that , having the @xmath83 and @xmath69 the same @xmath3 charge , the operators contributing to the second and third row of the mass matrix must have exactly the same operator structure in terms of flavon fields or , in other words , the coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath52 must be equal .    the choice @xmath85 is untenable ; in fact , in this case @xmath86 is already invariant ( and then @xmath87 ) whereas @xmath88 and the minimum choice of charges to get @xmath89 is @xmath90 ; in the mass matrix , this would mean that @xmath91 would be suppressed by @xmath92 compared to @xmath76 , thus destroying the wanted hierarchy as in eq.([emmee2 ] ) .",
    "one possible solution is to take @xmath93 ; in this case @xmath94 and @xmath95 and the last column of eq.([emmee2 ] ) is (    c ( /)^2 + / + / +    ) ~ (    c + 1 + 1 +    ) . with the same reasoning",
