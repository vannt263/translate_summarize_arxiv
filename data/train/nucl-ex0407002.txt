    "experimental studies , carried out during last two decades ( for review see @xcite and for update of the recent progress see e.g. @xcite ) , demonstrate that , in nuclear reactions such as the nucleus - nucleus collisions in the fermi energy domain or the collisions of a high - energy light particle with a heavy target , the amount of kinetic energy dissipated into the internal excitation energy is large enough to produce highly excited ( hot ) nuclei which may further de - excite via multifragmentation , a decay mode where the hot nucleus disintegrates into many fragments . in the nature",
    ", nuclear processes of such type can be observed in the interaction of cosmic rays with terrestrial and interplanetary matter .",
    "such spallation reactions contribute to the observed isotopic composition of the interstellar matter which can be used to study the properties of the cosmic rays and of their astrophysical sources ( for review see e.g. @xcite ) . with the advent of powerful accelerators of high - energy particles and , more recently , of heavy ions of intermediate and high energy",
    ", it became possible to study the process of multifragmentation in the laboratory .",
    "extensive experimental studies of multifragmentation are conducted since eighties of the last century .",
    "as can be deduced from observed experimental data @xcite , during the process of multifragmentation the nuclear medium becomes hot , expands and is supposed to undergo a phase transition where two phases are created , a dense isospin - symmetric phase ( liquid ) and a dilute isospin - asymmetric phase ( vapor or gas ) .",
    "such a phase transition was predicted by theory ( for review see @xcite )",
    ". the most common theoretical description of multifragmentation is based on the statistical model of multifragmentation @xcite , typically assuming a thermally equilibrated freeze - out configuration with hot ( excited ) or cold fragments .",
    "the probabilities of various fragment partitions can be evaluated analytically using the grand - canonical approach .",
    "while the statistical model of multifragmentation is quite successful in describing a wide range of fragment observables , it does not provide a specific information on the mechanism of the underlying process of fragment formation , apart from the assumption that at the freeze - out configuration a thermal equilibrium among the fragments is reached .",
    "the underlying process of cluster formation can be related to the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter at sub - saturation densities , where the phase transition is supposed to occur .",
    "the coexistence line , typical for the one - component system such as symmetric nuclear matter , develops with introduction of isospin asymmetry into a complex coexistence region @xcite , typically suggesting a coexistence of the dilute isospin - asymmetric phase and isospin - symmetric dense phase .",
    "further theoretical investigations @xcite suggest that instability modes responsible for the phase transition are typically a combinations of mechanical and chemical instability modes .    in this article , we present an overview of the recent progress in the studies of nuclear multifragmentation .",
    "we place a special emphasis on the exploration of isotopic trends in nuclear multifragmentation and the possibilities to extract physical information related to the nuclear equation of state .",
    "experimental studies of isotopic trends in nuclear multifragmentation have been made possible by use of the state - of - the - art detection techniques , which allow to identify individual isotopes of light charged particles and intermediate mass fragments in wide angular ranges .",
    "the isotopic composition of fragments can be used to extract the values of thermodynamical observables of the system undergoing multifragmentation such as temperature and chemical potentials ( free nucleon densities ) .",
    "various methods for extraction of temperature from isotopic composition are analyzed .",
    "an exponential scaling of the yields of specific isotopes from different reactions with the isotope neutron and proton numbers ( isoscaling ) is used to study the evolution of the isospin degrees of freedom of the system . finally , the nuclear equation of state and the isospin - asymmetric liquid - gas phase transition in the nuclear matter are discussed .",
    "multifragmentation is a process where the final state consists of multiple fragments which are the remnants of a hot nucleus .",
    "the aim of the multifragmentation theory is to relate the properties of final fragments to properties of the original hot nucleus .",
    "statistical phase - space models of multifragmentation typically assume that the properties of final fragments are determined in the so - called `` freeze - out '' configuration , where the typical distance of pre - fragments becomes , due to thermal expansion , larger than radius of the short - range nuclear interaction .",
    "it is , however , difficult to study the properties of the freeze - out configuration using the experimentally observed final fragments without additional model assumptions reflecting the reaction mechanism by which the hot nucleus was created .",
    "a detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanisms contributing to production of hot nuclei is necessary to properly characterize initial conditions of multifragmentation .",
    "the production of hot nuclei can be treated separately as a stage prior to multifragmentation , assuming that statistical equilibrium will be reached at later stage ( typically at freeze - out ) . in a microscopic description of nuclear medium ,",
    "multifragmentation can be related to a phase transition into dense and dilute phase .",
    "isospin asymmetry of two phases may be different .",
    "furthermore , multifragmentation can be treated dynamically using the transport theory .",
    "such treatment offers the possibility to study the evolution of the nuclear medium during the whole process , including the conditions for the isospin - asymmetric phase transition . in this section",
    "we briefly review the most relevant aspects of the multifragmentation theory and related reaction theory .",
    "a main assumption of the statistical phase - space models describing various processes is that a certain stage of the process can be identified where the available phase - space determines the final probability distribution of exit channels .",
    "for instance , in statistical description of the fully equilibrated compound nucleus , the probabilities of various evaporation channels are determined by available phase space of the corresponding evaporation residue and the fission probability is determined by available phase space at the saddle - point on top of the fission barrier . in the case of simultaneous multifragmentation , the phase - space is explored for the possible multi - fragment configurations ( partitions ) , typically at the stage where short - range nuclear interaction freezes out and the identities of final fragments are determined .",
    "this is the so - called `` freeze - out '' configuration .",
    "the probabilities of various partitions can be determined statistically , exactly using the micro - canonical ensemble @xcite , or approximately using the canonical and grand - canonical ensembles @xcite .",
    "canonical and grand - canonical approximations typically reduce the mathematical complexity while raising questions on the applicability of such approximations since the nuclei are rather small systems .",
    "detailed discussion of the application of statistical mechanics to small systems can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we briefly review the most commonly used phase - space model of multifragmentation , the statistical model of multifragmentation ( smm ) @xcite .",
    "the model uses the grand - canonical approximation , the freeze - out volume depends on fragment multiplicity and internal excitation of fragments in the freeze - out configuration is considered , thus producing `` hot '' fragments .",
    "analogous models with `` cold '' fragments also exist @xcite , typically the freeze - out volume is chosen approximately twice larger than in the case of hot fragments .",
    "yield of fragments with neutron and proton numbers n and z can be , within grand - canonical approach , characterized by formula @xcite :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the ground state spin degeneracy , @xmath2 is the free volume ( @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the volumes at freeze - out and ground state ) , @xmath6 is the thermal wavelength , @xmath7 is the intrinsic free energy of the fragment , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the free neutron and proton chemical potentials , and @xmath10 is the temperature . the free volume at freeze - out is determined as @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is determined as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the fragment multiplicity , @xmath15 is nuclear diffuseness , @xmath16 is the mass of the system and @xmath17 is the nuclear radius parameter .",
    "it is essentially a product of the additional fragment surface area and nuclear diffuseness length .",
    "the values of @xmath12 range from 0.2 to 2 .",
    "the fragment free energy is at most part determined using the liquid drop model .",
    "the component of free energy corresponding to coulomb interaction is determined using the wigner - seitz approximation .",
    "the wigner - seitz clusterization energy is calculated at volume @xmath18 .",
    "the value of @xmath19 can be related to average coulomb barrier and thus is generally different from @xmath12 , which controls the freeze - out of strong interaction .",
    "typical value is @xmath20 which is between the values for closely packed fragments ( @xmath21 ) and for fission ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the statistical model of multifragmentation was used for extensive comparisons with experimental multifragmentation data , typically obtaining a consistent description of a wide range of experimental observables @xcite .    as an alternative to models of simultaneous multifragmentation , the traditional model of compound nucleus decay based on hauser - feshbach approximation @xcite",
    "was extended to describe the emission of intermediate mass fragments ( imf ) @xcite .",
    "the emission of such complex fragments is described as a binary split , essentially an asymmetric fission where the imf is accompanied by a heavy residue .",
    "the emission probability is determined by a value of the mass - asymmetric fission barrier height .",
    "the model of fission - like binary split describes reasonably well the onset of fragment emission , thus indicating that at the onset the complex fragment emission is a fission - like process @xcite .",
    "success of such approach prompted the attempts to describe multifragmentation using the model of sequential binary decay ( sbd ) .",
    "several implementations ( e.g. the gemini code @xcite ) have been used extensively for comparisons with experimental multifragmentation data , with reasonable success in description of e.g. inclusive mass and charge distributions",
    ". however , the model of sequential binary decay fails to describe the results of the exclusive measurements at the zero angle @xcite allowing to select a narrow region around the multifragmentation threshold while smm performs rather well .",
    "an explanation is suggested by comparison of the model of sequential binary decay to transitional - state model of multifragmentation @xcite where even for binary exit channel the number of available degrees of freedom is different .",
    "furthermore , the model of sequential binary decay also fails to reproduce the observed fragment correlations @xcite .",
    "phase - space models of multifragmentation typically explore the properties of final fragments in the freeze - out configuration where nuclear interaction between the fragments does not play a role .",
    "the underlying mechanism leading to multifragmentation is nevertheless closely related to properties of the nuclear medium , which can be studied microscopically . over the recent decades",
    ", thermal properties of the nuclear medium were studied theoretically using microscopic approaches such as temperature - dependent hartree - fock @xcite or relativistic mean - field @xcite approximations .",
    "the microscopic theory of the nuclear matter predicts a phase transition of the liquid - gas type . below a critical temperature",
    ", the two phases can coexist .",
    "the spatial distribution of phases can be expected to develop from vapor bubbles in liquid at high density toward liquid droplets in vapor at low densities @xcite .",
    "a hot nucleus undergoing multifragmentation can be envisioned as rapidly expanding until it enters the spinodal region . at that stage multifragmentation",
    "occurs due to rapidly developing dynamical instabilities .",
    "when considering the isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite , the phase transition is supposed to lead to separation into a symmetric dense phase and asymmetric dilute phase .",
    "it has been discussed in literature @xcite to what extent such a phase transition is generated by fluctuations of density or concentration , typically suggesting a coupling of different instability modes .",
    "the properties of clusters formed in the phase transition can be described by a variety of random cluster models . simple model of clusterization was proposed by fisher @xcite , where the liquid drop expansion of the gibbs free energy leads to the mass distribution of clusters    @xmath23    where the surface term @xmath24 decreases monotonically toward zero as temperature approaches critical temperature @xmath25 . at critical temperature",
    "the mass distribution becomes a power law with critical exponent @xmath26 .",
    "similar properties are obtained using percolation models , lattice models and cellular model of fragmentation ( an extensive overview of these models in the context of multifragmentation can be found in @xcite , sections 4.,5 . ) .",
    "calculations based on the microscopic nuclear theory @xcite suggest that nuclear matter undergoes liquid - gas phase transition which is of the first order , the density difference between phases being the order parameter .",
    "similar conclusions can be obtained also in the context of smm @xcite .",
    "however , the phase transition in the percolation models is of the second order and lattice models such as ising model @xcite exhibit a complex phase diagram with both first and second order phase transitions .",
    "furthermore , since theory of nuclear phase transitions is formulated for infinite systems while the experiments investigate multifragmentation of finite nuclei , it is necessary to assess the effect of finite size .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the critical behavior observed in random - cluster models can be related to scaling properties and self - similarity of the system at different scales , what suggests that observed properties of finite system represent the properties of infinite media . on the other hand , finiteness constraints of small systems",
    "can lead to a behavior analogous to criticality @xcite .",
    "obviously , for any experimental observation the effect of finite size should be assessed .",
    "the statistical multifragmentation theory typically does not explicitly consider the evolution of the system prior to the freeze - out ( or underlying phase transition ) .",
    "usually it is difficult to determine the properties of the freeze - out configuration using the experimentally observed final fragments without additional model assumptions reflecting the reaction mechanism by which the hot nucleus was created .",
    "a detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanisms contributing to production of hot nuclei is necessary to properly characterize initial conditions of multifragmentation and to verify the model assumptions used by multifragmentation theory .    in order to undergo multifragmentation ,",
    "intrinsic excitation energy of the hot massive nuclei should exceed 2 - 3 amev .",
    "such excitation energies can be reached in nucleus - nucleus collisions with the nuclear beams of intermediate energies ( 20 - 100 amev ) . in collisions of a high - energy light particle with a heavy target the necessary energies range from hundreds of amev to agev .",
    "these are the reaction domains which have been used extensively for multifragmentation studies .",
    "a large variety of reaction mechanisms has been observed in nucleus - nucleus collisions in the fermi energy domain ( 20 - 50 amev ) depending on the impact parameter , projectile - target asymmetry and the projectile energy .",
    "the reaction mechanisms typically observed are @xcite : + - peripheral elastic and quasi - elastic ( qe ) scattering / transfer reactions around the grazing impact parameter .    - deep inelastic transfer ( dit ) reactions at semi - peripheral impact parameters with partial overlap of the projectile and target and a significant part of the relative kinetic energy transferred into internal excitation energies of the projectile and target .    - incomplete fusion ( icf ) reactions at central impact parameters with a typical participant - spectator scenario . at energies around the fermi energy the participant zone typically fuses with",
    "one of the spectator zones ( typically heavier ) thus creating a highly excited composite nucleus . at most central impact parameters",
    "the complete fusion ( cf ) can occur .",
    "- pre - equilibrium emission of direct particles , caused by onset of two - body nucleon - nucleon collisions at central and mid - peripheral impact parameters .",
    "pre - equilibrium emission typically precedes the icf / cf and dit reactions .",
    "+ while such a scheme is rather well justified by experimental data @xcite , there are still many open questions related to the reaction mechanism , specifically concerning the development of isospin - asymmetry in nucleus - nucleus collisions in the fermi energy domain . studies of isospin degrees of freedom in the nucleus - nucleus collisions in the fermi energy domain reveal many interesting details of the reaction scenario .",
    "recently , an enhancement in the production of neutron - rich nuclei was observed in peripheral nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite , which can be related to the effect of neutron - rich surface of the target .    at projectile energies of hundreds of amev and above the impinging light particle",
    "initiates an intra - nuclear cascade @xcite of nucleon - nucleon collisions which is the main mechanism leading to production of hot nuclei . the heavy remnant after the intra - nuclear cascade is highly excited and typically undergoes multifragmentation at wide range of impact parameters @xcite . in the nucleus - nucleus collisions at similar energies the participant zone develops independently of two spectator zones and typically disintegrates due to intense cascade of nucleon - nucleon collisions , with possibility to produce sub - nuclear particles via excitation of hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the spectator zones are relatively colder , nevertheless typically hot enough to undergo multifragmentation @xcite .      as an alternative to two - step reaction scenario , where reaction dynamics is attributed to the early stage of nucleus - nucleus collision",
    "while multifragmentation of the hot nucleus is described statistically , the whole process can be described in unified fashion by dynamical theory with explicit time - dependence .    in the microscopic time - dependent hartree - fock theory @xcite , an extension of the hartree - fock theory of the ground state , the nucleus - nucleus collision",
    "is represented by time evolution of the one - body mean field , which defines the collective degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "the time - dependent hartree - fock theory does exhibit collective behavior which reminds many experimentally observed phenomena @xcite , it nevertheless does not include two - body dissipation via collisions of nucleons which is supposed to play significant role at energy regimes where the hot nuclei are produced .",
    "two - body interaction can be included in the framework of quantum kinetic theory as represented by the boltzmann transport equation , which describes the reaction dynamics in terms of both mean - field and two - body dissipation .",
    "various semi - classical methods featuring the concept of pseudo - particle are used to simulate the solution of the boltzmann transport equation .",
    "the most common approximations are vlasov - uhling - uhlenbeck ( vuu ) @xcite , boltzmann - uhling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) @xcite , landau - vlasov ( lv ) @xcite , boltzmann - nordheim - vlasov ( bnv ) @xcite and quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite methods .",

    ", width=302,height=226 ]    apart from signatures of the first - order phase transition , several experimental works @xcite , exploring observed mass ( charge ) distributions , report a critical behavior in the multifragmentation data , which can be understood as a signal of the second - order phase transition at the critical temperatures between 5 - 10 mev @xcite . however , multifragmentation studies employing the statistical model analysis of charge distribution @xcite suggest the value of critical temperature above 15 mev . besides of raising obvious questions concerning the applicability of used methods of analysis , such contradictory observations may in principle suggest a complex phase diagram , possibly analogous to the ising model , where both first - order and second - order can be observed . it is also possible that the observed critical behavior is a specific feature of the finite system , as suggested in theory @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental work where the critical behavior is related to the size of largest fragment as an order parameter @xcite supports such assumptions .",
    "the finite - size effect can play role also in the multifragmentation of quasiprojectiles with a=20 - 30 and thus similar analysis for heavier sources is necessary to evaluate the role of such effect and establish the link to the phase transition in the isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter at sub - saturation densities .",
    "it may be however noted that theoretical studies of small systems @xcite suggest that van der waals - like loops observed in infinite systems are affected in transition to finite system only by small terms and thus the conclusions for finite systems can be in principle applicable also for infinite case .",
    "in this article we presented an overview of the recent progress in the studies of nuclear multifragmentation .",
    "theoretical and experimental concepts relevant to investigation of isotopic trends in nuclear multifragmentation were described and the possibilities to extract the physical information on the nuclear equation of state were outlined .",
    "a special emphasis was put on the methods how the isotopic composition of fragments can be used to extract the values of thermodynamical observables of the system undergoing multifragmentation such as temperature and chemical potentials ( free nucleon densities ) .",
    "various methods for extraction of thermodynamical variables were presented and possibilities of their use were documented on examples of multifragmentation data . it was shown that the yield ratios of specific isotopes from statistical multifragmentation typically exhibit an exponential scaling with various observables .",
    "the logarithmic slopes of such dependences can be related to thermodynamical observables such as grand - canonical temperatures ( isotopic thermometers ) or chemical potentials ( isoscaling ) . finally , an extensive overview of investigations of multifragmentation of the fully reconstructed quasi - projectiles is presented .",
    "the dominant reaction mechanism is determined as binary nucleus - nucleus collisions with intense dissipation and heating via nucleon exchange .",
    "the implications of the fragment data concerning the isospin - asymmetric liquid - gas phase transition in the nuclear matter are discussed .",
