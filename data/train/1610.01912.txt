    "the turnpike property of optimal trajectories was firstly observed and investigated by economists for finite - dimensional discrete - time optimal control problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the turnpike property reflects the fact that , for an optimal control problem for which the time horizon is large enough , its optimal solution spends most of the time remaining close to a referred turnpike , which is usually the optimal solution of a corresponding  static \" optimal control problem . in the last decades ,",
    "several turnpike theorems for optimal control problems have been obtained in a large number of works ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) , for discrete - time or continuous - time problems involving control systems in finite dimension .",
    "the usual turnpike property is somehow a qualitative feature for the limiting structure of optimal solutions to the optimal control problem as the time horizon tends to infinity . a quantitative behavior of the turnpike property ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    "is called the _ exponential turnpike property _ if the optimal solution remains exponentially close to the referred turnpike for a sufficiently large time interval contained in the time horizon frame .",
    "we also mention that the authors of @xcite proved that the long - time average of the solution for a mean field game system converges exponentially to the solution of the associated stationary ergodic mean field game .    in the recent work @xcite ,",
    "the exponential turnpike property has been established for linear quadratic optimal control problems in finite dimension under the kalman controllability rank condition , as well as for linear infinite - dimensional systems , covering the cases of linear heat and wave equations with internal controls under some observability inequality assumptions .",
    "a local version , for semilinear heat equations , has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite established the ( local ) exponential turnpike property for general finite - dimensional nonlinear control systems with general terminal constraint conditions , under some appropriate controllability and smallness assumptions .",
    "not only the optimal state and control , but also the corresponding adjoint vector , resulting from the application of the pontryagin maximum principle , were shown to remain exponentially close to an extremal triple for a corresponding static optimal control problem , except at the extremities of the time frame .",
    "the main ingredient in @xcite is an exponential dichotomy transformation early established in @xcite to uncouple the two - point boundary value problem coming from the pontryagin maximum principle , reflecting the hyperbolicity feature of the hamiltonian system .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to establish the exponential turnpike property for general infinite - dimensional nonlinear optimal control problems under exponential stabilizability and detectability assumptions ( theorem [ 731 - 10 ] in section [ sub2 ] ) .",
    "this extends to hilbert spaces the main results of @xcite .",
    "the result implies that , except at the beginning and at the end of the time frame , the optimal trajectory remains exponentially close to a steady - state , which is itself characterized as being a minimizer for an associated  static optimal control problem \" .",
    "we stress that , as in @xcite , our result establishes the exponential turnpike property , not only for the optimal state , but also for the optimal control and for the adjoint state ( or costate ) coming from the application of the pontryagin maximum principle .",
    "the latter property is particularly useful in order to implement and initialize successfully a numerical shooting method .    as a second main result ( theorem [ periodictarget ] in section [ sec_periodic ] ) , we consider linear quadratic optimal control problems with periodic tracking trajectories , i.e. , linear autonomous control systems ( still in hilbert spaces ) with a quadratic cost in which the integrand involves a periodic tracking term .",
    "we prove that , under exponential stabilizability and detectability assumptions , the optimal trajectory ( also , control and adjoint state ) remains exponentially close , except at the beginning and the end of the time frame , to a periodic optimal trajectory , which is characterized as being the optimal solution of an associated periodic optimal control problem .",
    "we are not aware of any general result establishing such a periodic turnpike property , even in the finite - dimensional case .",
    "note however that samuelson , who is , by the way , the inventor of the turnpike phenomenon that he discovered in the context of a von neumann model in view of deriving efficient programs of capital accumulation ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 12 ) ) , established in @xcite a periodic turnpike property for a specific optimal growth problem in economics in which the integrand of the minimization functional is periodic .",
    "periodic turnpike has been also considered in the recent paper @xcite within the dissipativity context .",
    "to prove the results , our approach takes advantage of the hyperbolic feature of optimality systems ( see @xcite ) resulting from the pontryagin maximum principle , as in @xcite .",
    "however , the invertibility of solutions of the matrix algebraic riccati equation played an important role in the argument of @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge , this argument is in general not valid in the infinite dimensional setting , because invertibility is closely related to an exact observability inequality and thus this would be a too much restrictive assumption in view of applications .",
    "one of the main technical novelties of the present paper is to design an extensive dichotomy transformation to overcome this difficulty .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section",

    "for instance , we were able to treat heat and wave equations with _ internal _ control , but not with a _ boundary _ control because then the control operator is unbounded .",
    "however , it is expected that similar exponential turnpike properties may also be established in a general context for infinite - dimensional optimal control systems with unbounded input and output operators .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a result in this direction , for a one - dimensional wave equation with neumann boundary control .",
    "although the results established in this paper are only in the framework of hilbert spaces , the methodology used here is applicable to the more general reflexive banach spaces , in which the pontryagin maximum principle for optimal control problems is valid . using the solvability of algebraic riccati equation in banach spaces ( see e.g. @xcite ) instead of that in hilbert spaces , a similar procedure can be carried out with some slight modifications as what we have done in our analysis for the case of hilbert spaces .",
    "we have emphasized in the introduction that the final state @xmath33 in the underlying optimal control problems is assumed to be free .",
    "this raises an obvious question : what happens if the final state is fixed , for instance , @xmath222 ?",
    "in finite dimension , the exponential turnpike theorem for this question has been established in @xcite under suitable kalman rank condition . in infinite dimension , however , from our analysis there is a twofold difficulty for this question .",
    "on one hand , the pontryagin maximum principle may fail in general .",
    "on the other hand , even if the pontryagin maximum principle is valid under certain finite codimensional condition on the final state ( cf .",
    "* chapter 4 , theorem 1.6 ) ) , however we still do not know how to prove the invertibility of the lyapunov operator @xmath223 constructed in . indeed , it is generally not invertible .",
    "for example , when @xmath224 one can easily check that @xmath223 is not invertible . 5 .",
    "we have established our main results for optimal control problems not involving any state or control constraint .",
    "indeed , the presence of constraints complicates the dynamics derived from the pontryagin maximum principle , and then identifying hyperbolicity features may be very challenging .",
    "for instance , control constraints may promote _ chattering _",
    ", i.e. , an infinite number of control switchings over a compact time interval . note that a turnpike phenomenon is suspected in @xcite , while chattering also occurs .",
    "+ consider for instance the linear quadratic optimal control problem @xmath110 considered in section [ sec_periodic ] .",
    "if we impose the simple control constraint @xmath225 , then the application of the pontryagin maximum principle leads to the same extremal equations , and to the extremal control @xmath226 since the extremal control is not smooth anymore , it is not clear how to analyze and use hyperbolicity properties of the extremal system , by linearization around the equilibrium corresponding to the optimal steady - state . oscillations may indeed occur ( with possible chattering as mentioned above ) and make the dynamical study complex .",
    "+ it is therefore challenging to consider the exponential turnpike property for optimal control problems with mixed state and/or control constraints , particularly including the time and norm optimal control problems for heat equations , at least , by using the approach developed in this paper , consisting of linearizing the extremal equations coming from the application of the pontryagin maximum principle .",
    "+ instead , an interesting alternative consists of using dissipativity properties of the control system .",
    "we refer to @xcite for investigating the exponential turnpike property for a class of strictly dissipative discrete - time systems in finite dimension . even in the presence of constraints ,",
    "the turnpike property may be analyzed within the viewpoint of strict dissipativity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such an analysis may reveal some relationships between strictly dissipativity and hyperbolicity , which are now two methodologies used in the literature to study the exponential turnpike property . in @xcite",
    ", we provide a comparison between these two approaches which yield results of different natures .",
    "6 .   our theorem [ 731 - 10 ] has been proved under the smallness assumption , because our approach consists of linearizing the optimality system near the optimal steady - state that is also an equilibrium point of the pontryagin equations .",
    "hence , this linearized system does not reflect what may happen far from this equilibrium point , and this is why the smallness condition is then required in the proof . establishing a global result , without such smallness assumptions ,",
    "may certainly be done , but at the price of having a good knowledge of the _ global _ dynamics .",
    "note that , in @xcite , the authors study in a specific context the optimality status of several turnpikes that are in competition .",
    "besides , dissipativity properties of the global dynamics ( see @xcite ) may also be a route to deriving global turnpike properties",
    "turnpike issues can be explored as well for shape optimization problems , by raising the question of whether optimal designs of a shape optimization problem for evolution systems approximate to those of an optimal steady - state one , as the time horizon is large enough .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an example of such a large time behavior for the two - phase optimal design for the heat equation , by using relaxation and homogenization .",
    "we notice that whether the admissible shapes depend on time or not makes a huge difference in the framework of shape optimization problems for evolution systems .",
    "for optimal control problems governed by infinite - dimensional evolution systems in which the pontryagin maximum principle can be applied , we obtain a hamiltonian system ( two - point boundary value problem ) coupling the optimal state and the associated adjoint state . in the proofs",
    ", we develop a dichotomy transformation acting on the solutions of the operator algebraic riccati and lyapunov type equations , in order to  decouple \" the hamiltonian system to a block - diagonal one , containing a contracting part ( which is stable ) and an expanding part ( which is unstable ) . as a byproduct",
    ", we obtain a quantitative description of the limiting behavior , interpreted as the exponential turnpike property , of the optimal solutions of the original optimal control problem , as the time horizon is large enough .    since the proofs of theorems  [ periodictarget ] and [ thm1lq ]",
    "are much easier than that of theorem  [ 731 - 10 ] , for the reader s convenience , we first give their proofs in section  [ 1252 ] and then we provide the proof of theorem  [ 731 - 10 ] in section  [ 1251 ] .",
