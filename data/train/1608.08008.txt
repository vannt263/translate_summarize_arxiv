    "the last two decades saw rapid technological advances in observational cosmology .",
    "various observations such as type ia supernova ( snia )  @xcite , the temperature and polarization anisotropy power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation  @xcite , and weak gravitational lensing  @xcite have all suggested that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion now . a possible explanation of this cosmic acceleration is provided by the introduction of a fluid with negative pressure called dark energy ( de ) .",
    "a simple dark energy candidate , i.e. , the cosmological constant @xmath3 whose equation of state @xmath4 together with the cold dark matter ( cdm ) ( called @xmath3cdm model ) is now called a standard model and fits the current observational data sets very well . however , some problems still exist and should be solved .",
    "for example , there is a strong tension between the value of the hubble constant derived from the cmb  @xcite and the value from local measurements  @xcite .",
    "moreover , understanding the physical character of dark energy , for example , whether it is dynamical ( @xmath5 ) or not , is one of the main challenges of modern cosmology    though we can now measure the cosmological parameters precisely from various observations and we can further improve the capabilities of these methods in the future , we should note that all of the measurements are through electromagnetic ( em ) methods . in 1986 , schutz showed that it is possible to determine the hubble constant from gravitational wave ( gw ) observations , by using the fact the the gws from the binary systems encode the absolute distance information  @xcite .",
    "thus the inspiraling and merging compact binaries consisting of neutron stars ( nss ) and black holes ( bhs ) , can be considered as standard candles , or _",
    "standard sirens_. this is due to the fact that the gw detectors are omni - directional and detect coherently the phase of the wave makes them in many ways more like microphones for sound than like conventional telescopes . from the gw signal",
    ", we can measure the luminosity distance @xmath6 directly , without having to rely on the cosmic distance ladder : standard sirens are _ self - calibrating_. assuming other techniques are deployed to obtain the redshift of a gw event , for example , we can measure the redshift through the identification of an accompanying em signal , we can get the @xmath7 ( luminosity distance - redshift ) relation .",
    "thus we can use the gw as an alternative source to constrain the cosmological parameters and it can also be a cross check to the em measurements .    on 11 february 2016 , the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) collaboration reported the first direct detection of the gravitational wave source gw150914  @xcite .",
    "this indicates the coming of the era of gw astronomy and the multi - message cosmology . in the last decades ,",
    "several papers have studied the use of gw as standard siren  @xcite .",
    "inspired by  @xcite , we want to estimate the constraint ability of cosmological parameters by the simulated data of gws using einstein telescope ( et ) .",
    "et is a european initiative for a third - generation detector  @xcite , as proposed by the design document , it consists of three co - located underground detectors , each with 10 km arm and with a @xmath8 opening angle .",
    "the et is envisaged to be ten times more sensitive in amplitude than the advanced ground - based detectors , covering a frequency range of @xmath9 hz",
    ". we will explore how accurately it might be possible to measure the cosmological parameters such as the hubble constant @xmath10 , dark matter density parameter @xmath11 , and the dark energy equation of state @xmath2 .",
    "since we only use the simulated luminosity distance data , and some of the cosmological parameters have degeneracy with each other , we can set some of those parameters fixed and the others to be free . for simplicity , we assume a flat universe since the spatial curvature is constrained to be very close to zero with @xmath12  @xcite and it has degeneracy with the dark energy density parameter when we constrain them using the simulated luminosity distance data  @xcite . we adopt markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc )",
    "method to constrain the hubble constant and the density parameter of dark matter . as for studying the dynamics of the dark energy ( i.e. , the evolution of the equation of state ) , some papers like  @xcite define the best pivot redshift @xmath13 .",
    "thus it can constrain @xmath2 better since at @xmath13 the equation of state has the minimal error . in this paper , we adopt a nonparametric method , i.e. , the gaussian process ( gp )  @xcite to reconstruct and constrain the equation of state according eq .  ( [ equa : w ] ) .",
    "we can choose the redshift region with the best performance of the reconstruction .",
    "comparing with the method which defines the best pivot redshift , we need not parameterize the equation of state , for example , using chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) form , and we can directly choose the redshift where @xmath2 has the minimal error .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sgrb ] , we introduce the basics of using gws as standard sirens in the potential et observation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : param_esti ] , we use mcmc and gp methods to constrain the cosmological parameters and to see with how many gw events we can achieve an accuracy comparable to the _ planck _ results .",
    "we give discussions and conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "for a friedmann - robertson - walker(frw ) universe , the line element reads @xmath14 , \\label{equa : ds}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the cosmic time , @xmath16 is the scale factor whose evolution depends on the matter and energy contents of the universe and @xmath17 corresponds to a closed , open and flat universe , respectively .",
    "note that we use units in which @xmath18 throughout this paper .",
    "then the luminosity distance can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "writing the dark energy equation of state @xmath22 , the hubble parameter @xmath23 is given by friedmann equation , @xmath24 \\nonumber\\\\             & ~~+{\\omega _ m}{(1 + z)^3 } + { \\omega _ k}{(1 + z)^2}\\big\\ } , \\label{equa : h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 are the matter and curvature density parameters today .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the late stage of the evolution of the universe , we can ignore the radiation component .",
    "combing eqs .",
    "( [ equa : dl ] ) and  ( [ equa : h ] ) and writing @xmath26 as the normalized comoving distance , we find that the equation of state can also be expressed as @xmath27 \\nonumber\\\\         & ~~\\big/\\big[3\\ { { ( 1 + z)^2}[{\\omega _ k } + ( 1 + z){\\omega _ m}]d{'^2 } \\nonumber\\\\         & ~~- ( 1 + { \\omega _ k}{d^2})\\ } d'\\big ] .",
    "\\label{equa : w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here a prime denotes the derivative with respect to redshift .",
    "thus we see that the equation of state of dark energy is directly related to the luminosity distance at every redshift @xmath28 once we know @xmath29 and @xmath11 .",
    "for our simulation we have to choose a fiducial cosmological model .",
    "the exact values of the cosmological parameters will not be essential in our simulations , because we are just interested in the precision with which they can be measured .",
    "however , for consistency with the current experiment data _ planck _ 2015  @xcite , we choose the cosmological parameters of the fiducial model as follows , @xmath30 here @xmath31kms@xmath32mpc@xmath32 .",
    "then our work is to test the precision with which we can recover those fiducial values in eq .",
    "( [ ini ] ) from a set of measured luminosity distance and redshift .      unlike current observations of the standard candles such as the type ia supernova ( snia )  @xcite , the chirping gw signals from inspiraling compact binary stars ( ns and bh ) can provide an absolute measure of distance , with no dependence on other sources  @xcite .",
    "since the gw amplitude depends on the so - called chirp mass and the luminosity distance , and the chirp mass can be measured from the gw signal s phasing , we can extract luminosity distance from the amplitude .",
    "interferometers are sensitive to the relative difference between two distances , so - called _",
    "strain_. in the transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge , the strain @xmath33 can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 are called the _ beam pattern functions _ , @xmath36 is the polarization angle , and ( @xmath37 ) are angles describing the location of the source in the sky , relative to the detector .",

    "\\label{equa : f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the three interferometers have @xmath8 with each other , arranged in an equilateral triangle , the two others antenna pattern functions are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "consider a coalescing binary with component masses @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we define @xmath46 as the total mass , @xmath47 as the symmetric mass ratio , and the `` chirp mass '' as @xmath48 . in the waveform of the gw we measure",

    "below , @xmath51 always denotes the observed chirp mass . since we will mostly be concerned with binary neutron stars , spin will not be important , in which case the phase of the waveform is computed in the post - newtonian formalism  @xcite up to 3.5 pn . following  @xcite , we apply the stationary phase approximation ( spa ) to compute the fourier transform @xmath52 of the time domain waveform @xmath33 @xmath53 , \\label{equa : hf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fourier amplitude @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 the constant @xmath56 denote the epoch of the merger , @xmath57 is the angle of inclination of the binary s orbital angular momentum with the line of sight .",
    "the definitions of the functions @xmath36 and @xmath58 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "measuring the redshift associated to a gw event is one of the biggest challenges when using gw as standard siren .",
    "several methods have been proposed for this issue , such as the use of galaxy catalogue proposed by schutz  @xcite , or using the neutron star mass distribution  @xcite , or through the tidal deformation of neutron stars  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use a more widely used method as in  @xcite : through the identification of an accompanying em signal , namely , an electromagnetic counterpart .",
    "the binary merger of a ns with either a ns ( bns ) or bh ( bhns ) is hypothesised to be the progenitor of a short and intense burst of @xmath0-rays , a so - called sgrb  @xcite .",
    "an em counterpart like sgrb can provide the redshift information if the host galaxy of the event can be pinpointed .",
    "moreover , sgrbs are likely to be strongly beamed phenomena , which allow one to constrain the inclination of the compact binary system , breaking the distance - inclination degeneracy . the expected rate of bns and bhns detections per year for et is about the order @xmath59",
    "@xcite , so et is likely to detect enough gw sources to perform precision cosmology , even under the assumption with em counterpart .",
    "in this section , we simulate many gw detections according to the predicted rates and distributions , and record the values and errors of luminosity distances and redshifts .",
    "we constrain the cosmological parameters by simulating many catalogues of bns and bhns systems .",
    "for the hubble constant and the dark matter density parameter , we follow a mcmc approach similar to  @xcite . as for the dark energy equation of state",
    ", we adopt a new nonparametric approach gp to reconstruct it .",
    "following  @xcite , the ns mass distribution is chosen to be uniform in the interval [ 1,2 ] @xmath60 , here @xmath60 is the mass of the sun .",
    "the black hole mass is chosen to be uniform between [ 3,10 ] @xmath60 .",
    "the ratio between bhns and bns events is taken to be 0.03 , as predicted for advanced ligo - virgo network  @xcite .",
    "the redshift distribution of the sources as observed on earth takes the form  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the comoving distance , which is defined as @xmath63 , @xmath64 describes the time evolution of the burst rate and takes the form  @xcite @xmath65 since it is expected that sgrbs are strongly beamed  @xcite , a coincident observation of the sgrb implies that the binary was orientated nearly face - on , i.e. @xmath66 . in fact the maximal inclination is about @xmath67 , however , averaging the fisher matrix over the inclination @xmath57 and the polarisation @xmath36 with the constrain @xmath68 will be approximately the same as taking @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can take @xmath69 and the fourier amplitude @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ equa : a ] ) will not then depend on @xmath36",
    ".    the performance of a gw detector is characterized by the one - side noise _ power spectral density _",
    "@xmath70 ( psd ) .",
    "we take the noise psd of et to be the same as in  @xcite .",
    "the combined signal - to ratio ( snr ) for the network of three independent interferometers is then @xmath71 where @xmath72 , the inner product is defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the fourier transforms of the functions @xmath16 and @xmath76 .",
    "the upper cutoff frequency is dictated by the last stable orbit , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the orbit frequency at the last stable orbit , and @xmath79 is the observed total mass . as in  @xcite",
    ", we also take @xmath80 hz . in line with the snr threshold currently used at ligo / virgo analysis , a gw detection is claimed only when the three et interferometers have a network snr of @xmath81 .",
    "since we ignore the spin of the bh , the bns or bhns systems can be characterised by nine parameters  @xcite . with the assumption of associated sgrbs",
    ", the location of the gw source can be pinpointed by observation of its em counterpart . furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the mass parameters can be accurately inferred and do not have considerable correlations with other parameters .",
    "thus in the amplitude eq .",
    "( [ equa : a ] ) , we are left with the set of parameters \\{@xmath82}. using the fisher information matrix , we can estimate the instrumental error on the measurement of the luminosity distance .",
    "suppose that the error on @xmath6 is uncorrelated with the errors on the remaining gw paramters , we can find that  @xcite @xmath83 as @xmath84 , we can get @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the combined snr of et . however , we ignore the correlation with the remaining gw parameters , especially the inclination . to account for the correlation between the @xmath6 and @xmath57",
    ", we note that the maximal effect of the inclination on the snr is a factor of 2 , so we double the estimate of the error on the luminosity distance  @xcite @xmath87 furthermore , then the luminosity distance will also be affected by an additional error @xmath88 due to the weak lensing . as in  @xcite , we assume @xmath89 . thus , the total uncertainty on the measurement of @xmath6 is taken to be @xmath90    for the current errors of spectroscopic redshift determination are negligible compared to the errors in the luminosity distance , we can ignore the errors of the redshift measurement by means of the em observations .",
    "thus , combining the fiducial model in eq .",
    "( [ ini ] ) , the redshift distribution in eq .",
    "( [ equa : pz ] ) , and the luminosity distance uncertainties in eq .",
    "( [ sigmadl ] ) , we can simulate the measurements of the redshifts with the luminosity distances for the gw events of bns or bhns .",
    "the basic steps are as follows .",
    "we firstly simulate the redshift measurements according to the redshift distribution . at every simulated redshift",
    ", we can calculate the fiducial value of the luminosity distance according to eqs .",
    "( [ equa : dl ] ) and  ( [ ini ] )",
    ". then we randomly sample the mass of the neutron star , the mass of the black hole , and the position angle @xmath91 in the three intervals : [ 1,2 ] @xmath60 , [ 3,10 ] @xmath60 , and [ 0,@xmath92 respectively ( we need not consider the other two angles @xmath93 and @xmath36 since the snr is not dependent on them ) .",
    "note that here we set the ratio of the possibility to detect the bhns and bns events @xmath94 .",
    "then we calculate the combined snr of each set of random sample , and confirm it is a gw detection if @xmath81 . for every confirmed detection",
    ", we simulate the luminosity distance measurement @xmath95 from the fiducial value of @xmath96 and the error @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ sigmadl ] ) .",
    "we sample the luminosity distance measurements according to the gaussian distribution @xmath98 .",
    "thus we simulate both the redshift and the luminosity distance measurements .",
    "since et is expected to detect @xmath59 binary ns coalescences per year , we just expect only a small fraction ( @xmath99 ) of them with an observation of sgrb .",
    "so , we can vary the observed number of sources from 100 up to 1000 to see with how many events we can constrain the cosmological parameters as precisely as the current _ planck _ results .",
    "an example simulated data from the fiducial model with 1000 observed events is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotdl ] .          to constrain @xmath100 and @xmath11",
    ", we set them to be two free parameters .",
    "for a set of @xmath101 simulated data points , the @xmath102 is given by @xmath103 ^ 2 \\label{equa : chi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are the @xmath107th redshift , luminosity distance , and error of luminosity distance of the simulated observational data sets .",
    "@xmath108 presents the set of cosmological parameters .",
    "we adopt the mcmc method to find the likelihood of each parameter . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : homegam ] , we find that with about 500 - 600 gw events we can constrain the hubble constant with an accuracy comparable to _ planck _ temperature data and _ planck _ lensing combined results  @xcite . as for the dark matter density parameter",
    ", the gw alone seems not able to provide the constraints as well as for the hubble constant , but about 1000 gw events will give the same constraint ability as _ planck _ data .",
    "now we want to study the ability of the standard siren to infer the nature of dark energy . unlike the previous works  @xcite which define a pivot point , here we adopt a new nonparametric method gaussian process to reconstruct @xmath1 in the whole redshift region . here",
    "we should note that using this method has some advantages and also disadvantages .",
    "the first advantage is that we can study the nature of the dark energy in the whole redshift region .",
    "once having reconstructed the luminosity distance , we can use it to reconstruct @xmath1 at every redshift we want .",
    "secondly , we can simply set @xmath1 as a function of redshift @xmath28 , and need not parameterize the equation of state like the cpl form .",
    "thus we can constrain the equation of state more directly and model independently . however",
    ", the gp reconstruction method has some shortcomings . since we use only the simulated data of the luminosity distance to reconstruct @xmath1 , the errors of the reconstructed @xmath1 heavily depends on the quality of those simulated data .",
    "we can see blow that the errors of @xmath1 become large in the high-@xmath28 region .",
    "so , we just focus on the low redshift region in which the reconstruction performs well .",
    "anyway , we want to use a new nonparametric method to reconstruct the equation of state from the simulated data , and check it s ability of constraining @xmath1 in the low redshift region .",
    "the gaussian processes allow one to reconstruct a function from data without assuming a parametrization for it .",
    "the detailed analysis and description of the gp method can be found in  @xcite , in which the authors studied the use of gp method to reconstruct dark energy dynamics from supernovae data .",
    "some of the gp s applications can also be found in our previous works  @xcite .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ equa : w ] ) , we transform the reconstruction of distance @xmath109 and obtain the constraint of @xmath1 for the cases with different numbers of gw events .",
    "we compare our results with _ planck _ 2015 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wplot ] for the cases with @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively . since we use only the @xmath112 data sets to reconstruct the equation of state @xmath1 which is dependent on @xmath28 , while we compare it with the constant @xmath2 constrained by _",
    "data combined with type ia supernovae , the reconstructed errors of @xmath1 in our results are of course larger than the error with constant @xmath2 in the high-@xmath28 region . however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wplot ] , we can see that 700 gw events can give the same constrain to @xmath1 as _ planck _ in the low redshift region .",
    "thus , the gws can be an alternative source to study the dynamics of the dark energy .",
    "we can expect that with better data analysis method , combining the gws with the traditional em data , the cosmological parameters can be constrained more precisely .     +",
    "in this paper , we studied the gravitational wave as a standard siren to constrain the cosmological parameters .",
    "gravitational waves from coalescing binaries directly encode the luminosity distance .",
    "the redshift @xmath28 of the sources can be determined with great accuracy through the electromagnetic counterparts .",
    "candidate electromagnetic signal is the short @xmath0-ray burst , that is supposed to be aftermath of binary system with at least one neutron star .",
    "we used the et to infer cosmological parameters by simulating binary systems of ns - ns and ns - bh that have accompanying em signal .",
    "we estimated the instrumental error on the luminosity distance by using the fisher matrix .",
    "we also added the weak lensing errors to the instrumental error . combing the redshift distribution with the fiducial model , we simulated the luminosity distance measurements from 100 up to 1000 gw events .    for the hubble constant and the dark matter density parameter , we used mcmc method to derive their likelihoods .",
    "we found that with about 500 - 600 gw events we can constrain the hubble constant with an accuracy comparable to _ planck _ 2015 results .",
    "as for the dark matter density parameter , about 1000 gw events will give the same constraints as _ planck _ data .",
    "for studying the dynamics of the dark energy , we adopted a new nonparametric method gaussian process to reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "for the feature of this method , we focused on the constraint in the low redshift region .",
    "we found that about 700 gw events can give the constraints of @xmath1 comparable to that of the constant @xmath2 by _",
    "planck _ data with type ia supernovae .",
    "those results show that the gw as a standard siren to probe the cosmological parameters can provide an independent and complementary alternative to current experiments .    here",
    "we would like to mention that observing an electromagnetic counterpart is not the only method to measure the redshift associated to a gw event .",
    "the other ways to get the redshift information can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the spin of bh can also help us estimate the gw s parameters .",
    "it is expected that combing gw data with other astronomical observations such as supernovae , and adopting a better data analysis approach , the cosmological parameters could be constrained more precisely than the current situation .",
