    "entanglement is a quantum phenomenon with numerous potential quantum information applications  @xcite .",
    "however , the practical realization of such applications is typically faced with various sources of noise , which affect the performance and design of entanglement - enabled technologies .",
    "it is of practical interest to understand how entanglement is influenced by any such experimental imperfections .",
    "this problem has stimulated considerable research efforts , which has introduced the concepts of entanglement sudden death and revival  @xcite , entanglement robustness  @xcite , entanglement - breaking  @xcite and entanglement - annihilating processes  @xcite .",
    "one of the main lessons of entanglement theory  @xcite is that the presence of entanglement is in general extremely difficult to verify .",
    "therefore , some limitations are typically imposed on both initial states and noise models in most of the studies on the dynamics of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "no doubt such analysis is in many cases of great practical relevance , however , the conclusions do not necessarily capture the universal behavior of entanglement .",
    "in fact , it is questionable whether some universal entanglement dynamics features do exist .",
    "for example , are there processes capable of creating ( not decreasing ) entanglement regardless of the initial state ? or , on the other hand , are there processes that destroy any entanglement ? is there some equation capturing the dynamics of entanglement ?",
    "the first of these questions resulted in considering various aspects of entangling and disentangling capabilities of quantum processes @xcite .",
    "the other two questions were mostly studied for one - side noisy processes @xmath0 , where the noise @xmath1 acts only on one of the subsystems while the rest of subsystems evolve in a noiseless manner ( @xmath2 ) . for such processes ,",
    "the so - called evolution equation for entanglement has been derived  @xcite .",
    "it says that the change of the entanglement due to one - sided noise is quantitatively bounded by its action on the maximally entangled state .",
    "then , all the noises @xmath1 that disentangle the maximally entangled state will also disentangle a given subsystem ( under the noise action ) from any other subsystem ( noiseless ) regardless of the initial state of the global system , _ ipso facto _ forming a class of entanglement - breaking ( eb ) processes  @xcite .    in practice , however , the noise is rarely one - sided .",
    "this is the reason why the notion of entanglement - annihilating ( ea ) processes was introduced in ref .",
    "formally , the noise ( not necessarily one - sided , or local ) is ea if its action disentangles all the subsystems forming the composite system .",
    "ea processes acting on a composite system do not necessarily disentangle the system from its surrounding , they only destroy entanglement between subsystems accessible in experiment .",
    "for instance , it could happen that the joint action of local noises on individual subsystems constitutes an ea process even if none of the local noises is eb  @xcite .",
    "although ea processes impose fundamental limitations on the performance of entanglement - enabled experiments , they are not explored much . in this paper",
