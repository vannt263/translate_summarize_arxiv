    "dynamic evolutions of various astrophysical shock flows under gravity on completely different spatial and temporal scales have been attracting astrophysicists , mainly because of a rich variety of observational phenomenology in different astrophysical systems , such as stellar collapses , supernova explosions and supernova remnants ( e.g. , bethe et al .",
    "1979 ; goldreich & weber 1980 ; chevalier 1982 ; yahil 1983 ; lattimer & prakash 2004 ; lou & wang 2006 , 2007 ; lou & cao 2008 ; lou & hu 2008 in preparation ) , star formation , proto - stellar core formation as well as ` champagne flows ' in star - forming molecular clouds ( e.g. , shu 1977 ; shu et al . 1987 ; tsai & shu 1995 ; shu et al . 2002 ; shen & lou 2004 ; bian & lou 2005 ; lou & gao 2006 ) , formation and spherical accretions of black holes ( e.g. , bondi 1952 ; bahcall & ostriker 1975 ; hennawi & ostriker 2002 ; cai & shu 2005 ; hu et al .",
    "2006 ) , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) at the galactic level ( e.g. , small & blandford 1992 ) and the formation of galaxy clusters and voids in the universe ( e.g. , gunn & gott 1972 ; fillmore & goldreich 1984a , b ; bertschinger 1985 ) as well as dynamic galaxy cluster winds ( lou , jiang & jin 2008 ; jiang & lou 2008 in preparation ) .",
    "this broad class of theoretical models poses challenges for a deeper and simpler theoretical understanding of relevant astrophysical shock flows under consideration .",
    "meanwhile , these problems also involve a diverse range of physical processes and the relevant model investigations often involve numerical hydrodynamic simulations with data input from high - energy physics experiments and/or theories ( e.g. , janka & mller 1996 for supernovae ) .    in this paper , we mainly focus on basic hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) aspects of this class of problems because of the relative simplicity and generality , allowing for various novel and interesting solution features to manifest .",
    "we introduce the general polytropic description to subsume several unspecified energetic processes into a few index parameters",
    ". there might be certain evolution phases where a simple and direct analysis works almost as well as numerical simulations do ( e.g. , janka & mller 1996 ) , and in this situation such an analysis would be extremely valuable for physical insight ( e.g. , yahil 1983 ) and for testing numerical codes in construction . in this spirit , we advance a theoretical mhd flow model with this kind of simplification ( e.g. , self - similarity ) and idealization ( e.g. , a completely random transverse magnetic field and specific entropy conservation along streamlines ) to reveal plausible mhd behaviours and shocks of magnetized gas flows of astrophysical interests .",
    "while self - similar evolutions of gas dynamics in spherical geometry have been actively pursued early on ( e.g. , sedov 1959 ; bodenheimer & sweigart 1968 ; larson 1969a , b ; penston 1969a , b ) , extensively analyzed by many in diverse astrophysical contexts ( e.g. , shu 1977 ; hunter 1977 ; cheng 1978 ; goldreich & weber 1980 ; chevalier 1982 ; yahil 1983 ; whitworth & summers 1985 ; tsai & hsu 1995 ; shu et al . 2002 ; shen & lou 2004 ; fatuzzo et al .",
    "2004 ; lou & gao 2006 ) and significantly reformulated in various physical aspects ( e.g. , terebey , shu & cassen 1984 ; suto & silk 1988 ; chiueh & chou 1994 ; mclaughlin & putritz 1997 ; boily & lynden - bell 1995 ; cai & shu 2005 ) , we have found novel features and generalized similarity solutions for this type of classical nonlinear problems in recent years . as examples , our new similarity solution features include envelope expansion with core collapse ( eecc ) solutions which smoothly pass through the sonic critical line twice ( lou & shen 2004 ; lou & gao 2006 ) , quasi - static asymptotic solutions ( lou & wang 2006 ) , quasi - static asymptotic mhd solutions ( lou & wang 2007 ; wang & lou 2007 ) , quasi - static asymptotic solutions in two gravity - coupled fluids ( lou , jiang & jin 2008 ; jiang & lou 2008 in preparation ) , strong magnetic field solutions ( yu & lou 2006 ; wang & lou 2007 ) , and various new ( mhd ) shock solutions ( shen & lou 2004 ; bian & lou 2005 ; yu et al . 2007 ) .",
    "in addition to the known larson - penston ( lp ) type solutions and central free - fall solution ( shu 1977 ) , the existence of several new nonlinear self - similar mhd polytropic flow solutions reveals multiple clues and leads to new concepts .",
    "first of all , knowing these self - similar nonlinear solutions , we realize that a number of self - similar behaviours may possibly occur in seemingly similar flow systems , and the evolution problem of ` which goes where ' remains an important open question .",
    "clearly , this can not be immediately answered within the self - similar framework .",
    "while it is generally thought that self - similar behaviour gradually emerges when a dynamical system evolves sufficiently far away from its initial and boundary conditions , we would emphasize that initial and boundary conditions do affect the nonlinear self - similar behaviour in the sense of which similarity behaviour emerges eventually . in other words ,",
    "the final self - similar phase still retains memory of a certain class of initial and boundary conditions . as an example",
    ", tsai & hsu ( 1995 ) introduced a self - similar behaviour that has the outer ( initial ) configuration the same as that of shu ( 1977 ) , but their inner ( final ) behaviour is qualitatively different from that of shu ( 1977 ) : the model of tsai & hsu ( 1995 ) includes a self - similar isothermal shock and also the central mass accretion rate differs from that of shu ( 1977 ) . as suggested by simulation results of tsai & hsu ( 1995 ) , a stronger push at the centre of a static isothermal sphere may result in a shock , while a weaker push will lead to an isothermal expansion - wave collapse solution ( ewcs ; see their figs .",
    "@xmath3 ) . secondly ,",
    "although former nonlinear self - similar solutions were often obtained from numerical simulations first ( e.g. , larson 1969a , b ; penston 1969a , b ) , the very existence of different self - similar behaviours in the same physical setting would imply that so far numerical hydrodynamic simulations might have not been sufficiently thorough in exploring the overall dynamic evolution features of nonlinear flows with or without shocks .",
    "these semi - analytical solutions are important clues and benchmarks for numerical code development .",
    "more importantly , numerical simulations can further tell whether new self - similarity solutions obtained in our analysis can be actually realized under realistic flow situations , by introducing different initial and boundary conditions for a similar flow system and by observing which similarity behaviour does it manifest eventually .    finally ,",
    "it is also possible that one flow system may not behave self - similarly in the strict sense , nonetheless its evolution can be qualitatively explained by intuitions gained by examining various self - similar solutions : for example , the central free - fall phase of shu ( 1977 ) is common for a wide range of polytropic index @xmath2 ; the existence of other new solutions requires specialized conditions .",
    "physically , our new asymptotic solutions have different features in terms of the balance and competition of the involved forces , which tells us about the possible asymptotic flow behaviours . as an essential ingredient in our theoretical model development ,",
    "magnetic fields are important in various astrophysical settings ; their presence in ionized plasma systems is ubiquitous and they play dynamical as well as diagnostic roles in many ways ; they are responsible for sporadic violent activities and for producing relativistic particles such as cosmic rays through shocks and reconnection .",
    "the generation of magnetic fields is related to convective motions , sustained turbulence and differential rotations , via dynamo effects or magnetorotational instabilities ( mri ) ( e.g. , parker 1979 ; thompson & duncan 1993 for dynamo effects of magnetized pulsars ; chandrasekhar 1961 ; balbus & hawley 1998 ; balbus 2003 for disc magnetorotational instabilities ) . for the purpose of our formulation here",
    ", we take the presence of magnetic field for granted and simply presume that a completely random magnetic field permeates in a gas medium with self - gravity .",
    "this gas medium can be stellar interior , hot stellar coronae , interstellar medium ( ism ) , or intracluster medium ( icm ) and so forth .    during the collapse phase of a quasi - spherical system under self - gravity , a highly conducting magnetofluid undergoes a magnetic field enhancement through the magnetic flux conservation ,",
    "commonly referred to as the frozen - in condition for magnetic field .",
    "when rotation is sufficiently slow in an astrophysical system , the overall geometry may remain quasi - spherical and our model analysis with the quasi - spherical random - field approximation ( e.g. , zeldovich & novikov 1971 ) can be applicable ( yu & lou 2005 ; yu et al .",
    "2006 ; lou & wang 2007 ; wang & lou 2007 ; lou & hu 2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "chiueh & chou ( 1994 ) first studied a quasi - spherical isothermal mhd problem by including the magnetic pressure gradient into the radial momentum equation .",
    "however , the magnetic tension force does not average to zero ( yu & lou 2005 ; wang & lou 2007 ) and thus should be also included .",
    "although on small scales , magnetic tension force tends to drive inhomogeneous gas motions , we presume that these non - spherical flows may be neglected as compared to the large - scale radial bulk motion of gas .",
    "the key point is that the ( self-)gravity is strong enough to hold on the entire gas mass and induce core collapse . hence on large scales in a quasi - spherical geometry , a completely random magnetic field contributes to the dynamics in the form of the average magnetic pressure gradient force and the average magnetic tension force in the radial direction . in a series of papers during past several years",
    ", we have systematically investigated isothermal mhd problems ( yu & lou 2005 ; yu et al .",
    "2006 ) and polytropic mhd problems in the special case of a _ constant _ specific entropy in space at all time ( i.e. , @xmath4 with a constant @xmath5 , a pressure @xmath6 , a mass density @xmath7 , and a polytropic index @xmath2 ; wang & lou 2007 ; lou & wang 2007 ; lou & hu 2008 , in preparation ) . under certain circumstances ,",
    "the isothermality may be a crude yet sensible first approximation for astrophysical fluid dynamics with or without magnetic field ( e.g. , for star formation processes within a collapsing molecular cloud , shu 1977 ; hot bubbles and superbubbles in ism produced by supernovae , lou & zhai 2008 , in preparation ; or central core collapse region of a globular cluster , bahcall & ostriker 1975 ; inagaki & lynden - bell 1983 ) , even for modeling shocks in dynamical processes ( e.g. , courant & friedrichs 1976 ; spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "in other situations , a polytropic fluid with a _ constant _ specific entropy is invoked for theoretical model investigation ( e.g. , goldreich & weber 1980 for a stellar collapse of a relativistically hot gas priori to the rebound process ; yahil 1983 for gravitational core collapses ; suto & silk 1988 ; lou & cao 2008 for rebound processes in stellar core collpases ) . while the polytropic approximation with a constant specific entropy is a useful description for various astrophysical processes , there is however no obvious reason why the entropy should necessarily remain constant in a polytropic gas . in dynamic processes ,",
    "a more general situation involves the ` specific entropy ' conservation along streamlines ; and this includes the constant entropy as a special case .",
    "therefore , self - similar polytropic gas evolution under this ` equation of state ' represents a significant generalization of the ` constant entropy ' problem , and can be more adaptable to various dynamic model applications in astrophysics .    indeed , several authors have adopted such an ` equation of state ' and carried out their model analyses to various extents ( e.g. , cheng 1978 ; chevalier 1982 ; fatuzzo et al .",
    "2004 ; wang & lou 2007 ; lou & cao 2008 ; lou & hu 2008 , in preparation ) . in technical terms , adopting such an ` equation of state ' is equivalent to freeing the choice of index parameter @xmath0 in the usual self - similar transformation equation ( [ transform1 ] ) from the constraint @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the polytropic index ( wang & lou 2007 ) . here , this index parameter @xmath0 holds the key to the scaling of physical variables under consideration , such as mass density , random magnetic field strength , radial flow velocity , pressure , and temperature in the outer portion of a quasi - spherical gas . as @xmath2 is a thermodynamic parameter",
    ", we expect that @xmath0 and @xmath2 parameters should be independent of each other in general . for instance",
    ", lou & wang ( 2007 ) have shown that the radial scaling of a completely random magnetic field is actually independent of the polytropic index @xmath2 .",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to revisit the self - similar mhd problem ( wang & lou 2007 ) but with an equation of state for specific entropy conservation along streamlines and to generalize our new self - similar hydrodynamic and mhd solutions into a substantially larger parameter regime .",
    "this paper with special emphasis on theoretical aspects is structured as follows .",
    "our motivation and background information are provided in section 1 as an introduction .",
    "section 2 describes the basic formalism on nonlinear mhd flows with a completely random transverse magnetic field , including the self - similar transformation and mhd shock conditions .",
    "section 3 presents various analytical asymptotic mhd solutions for large and small @xmath8 as well as along the magnetosonic critical curve ; these asymptotic mhd solutions are valuable for understanding relevant physics and can be utilized to construct global semi - complete solutions which are valid in the range of @xmath9 .",
    "section 4 shows examples of various possible semi - complete global solutions with or without mhd shocks and outlines astrophysical applications of these solution types .",
    "we discuss our results in section 5 .",
    "mathematical details are included in several appendices for the convenience of reference .",
    "in spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , the basic nonlinear equations for a quasi - spherical mhd evolution of a general polytropic gas under self - gravity include the mass conservation equation @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the gas mass density , @xmath17 is the bulk radial flow speed , @xmath18 is the enclosed mass within radius @xmath10 at time @xmath19 ; the radial momentum equation @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath6 is the thermal gas pressure , @xmath22 is the ensemble average of the random transverse magnetic field @xmath23 squared , @xmath24 is the gravitational constant ; the magnetic induction equation @xmath25 and the conservation equation for ` specific entropy ' , simply regarded as an index parameter , is not necessarily the ratio of actual gas specific heats . ]",
    "@xmath26 along streamlines .",
    "note that the poisson equation relating the mass density and the gravitational potential is consistently satisfied under the approximation of a quasi - spherical symmetry .",
    "this set of mhd equations is the same as that of wang & lou ( 2007 ) and lou & wang ( 2007 ) , except for equation ( [ basic6 ] ) , which is the key difference between this analysis and our former analyses .",
    "in other words , the equation of state @xmath27 with @xmath5 being a constant is only one special case satisfying equation ( [ basic6 ] ) and is referred to as the ` usual ' or ` conventional ' polytropic equation of state .",
    "equation of state ( [ basic6 ] ) has been adopted in various previous works as noted in section 1 .",
    "the assumptions on random magnetic field distribution ( zeldovich & novikov 1971 ) and magnetic induction are the same as those in yu & lou ( 2005 ) , yu et al .",

    "imply that @xmath59 ( directly related to the ` specific entropy ' ) can be a fairly arbitrary function of the enclosed mass @xmath18 along streamlines .",
    "it is our requirement of self - similarity solutions that leads to the specific power - law form of relation ( [ transform6 ] ) .",
    "the key point of this analysis is that @xmath60 or @xmath61 is allowed in general .",

    "the reason is simply that if we write @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an arbitrary scaling coefficient , then a change of parameter @xmath43 in self - similarity transformation equation ( [ transform1 ] ) to @xmath65 would make the coefficient @xmath66 disappear .",
