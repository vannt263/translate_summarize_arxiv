    "the transient radio universe has not yet been monitored and studied in detail .",
    "upcoming telescopes such as the murchison widefied array - low frequency demonstrator ( mwa - lfd ) have studies of radio transients as one of their major science goals .",
    "a software data - processing pipeline is being developed by the raman research institute for low - frequency detection and studies of transients and pulsars .",
    "a schematic of the transient search pipeline is give in fig .",
    "[ fig_pipeline ] .",
    "the objective of transient search is the detection of dispersed pulses in noisy data . therefore , the first step in the search for transients and pulsars is de - dispersion , wherein frequency - dependent delay correction is employed , and the delay - corrected frequency channels are collapsed , to achieve maximum signal to noise ratio ( s / n )",
    ". de - dispersion is done over a range of trial dispersion measure ( dm ) values .",
    "the delay between two frequency channels @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given , in units of milliseconds , by @xmath2 where the frequencies are in mhz and dm is expressed in @xmath3 pc .",
    "the dm value is stepped over a range of trial dms , with the step size corresponding to minimum smearing of the pulse given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the centre frequency of the band and @xmath6 is the bandwidth , both in mhz , and @xmath7 is the sampling period in milliseconds .",
    "the single pulse search technique is a brute - force search for s / n as a function of dm and smoothing . unlike the standard pulsar search technique",
    ", periodicity is not probed in this method .",
    "the process involves searching for single bright pulses @xcite .      if the intensity of a sample crosses a particular threshold that is not crossed by its noise component alone , it is a potential candidate .",
    "selection of the threshold is an important criterion in transient search .",
    "if the threshold is too low , inherent noise fluctuation can cause a large number of false alarms .",
    "if the threshold is too high , a relatively weak astronomical signal may not be registered as a candidate . for gaussian noise , the threshold @xmath8 in units of rms noise",
    "is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of false alarms and @xmath11 is the total number of samples , and @xmath12 is the error function whose standard form is given by @xmath13",
    "radio frequency interference ( rfi ) can have a significant impact on the ability to detect weak astronomical signals .",
    "rfi is mainly classified based on their bandwidth .",
    "narrow - band rfi can be identified by analysing the smoothness of its spectrum . for continuum signals",
    ", spectral features can not be narrower than what the order of the filter dictates .",
    "spectral lines from astronomical sources are narrow , but they can be identified by virtue of the fact that they have the same temporal statistics as continuum signals .",
    "rfi does not follow the same statistics , leading to identification .",
    "radio astronomical signals are always dispersed , although the effect of dispersion is apparent only for suitably short - duration signals .",
    "if dispersive characteristics are absent in the signal , it can be concluded that it is of terrestrial origin .",
    "unfortunately , the converse is not always true .",
    "some broadband rfi mimic the dispersed nature of astronomical signals , when the rfi frequency sweeps across the observing band .",
    "swept - frequency radars are typical sources of such rfi .",
    "the difference between this type of rfi and astronomical signals is that the former is less likely to follow the dispersion law @xmath14 as followed by the latter , and is more likely to appear to be ` dispersed ' in a linear manner .",
    "our single pulse search technique extends the original single pulse search algorithm by introducing ` dispersion law ' as a third parameter , in addition to time duration and dm .",
    "a ` maximum s / n cube ' corresponding to one candidate pulse is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_summary](a ) and ( e ) , with the former corresponding to the pulsar , and the latter , a swept - frequency rfi in the data from an observation of the pulsar b1919 + 21 .",
    "the maximum s / n with respect to dm channel and pulse width is represented by the mesh layers .",
    "the vertical axis marks the dispersion law .",
    "the two laws represented here are the linear ( @xmath15 , dispersion law index 1 ) and the inverse square law ( @xmath16 , dispersion law index 2 ) .",
    "the maximum of the s / n values corresponding to each law is calculated and compared , and as can be seen in fig .  [ fig_summary](d ) and ( h ) , the slope of the curve indicates whether the candidate is the result of rfi , or an astronomical transient .",
    "we thank the gauribidanur telescope staff , especially h. aswathappa , and the ooty radio telescope staff for their help in the observations .",
