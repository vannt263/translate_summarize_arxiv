    "since the experimental observation of the crucial effects of the coulomb interaction,@xcite mesoscopic fluctuations of the inverse compressibility in two - dimensional quantum dots have been investigated intensively , both theoretically and experimentally.@xcite recent experiments@xcite on the distribution of the inverse compressibility , which can be measured by conductance peak spacing , in the coulomb - blockade regime have shown that the standard random matrix theory fails to explain the observed fluctuations ; this implies that charging energy fluctuations may play a dominant role in the inverse - compressibility fluctuations .",
    "in particular , the distribution was observed to take a gaussian - like symmetric form with non - gaussian tails.@xcite subsequent analytical and numerical studies on interacting electrons in disordered systems revealed the possibility of larger inverse - compressibility fluctuations induced by coulomb interactions.@xcite it was also proposed that the shape deformation of the dot due to the gate - voltage sweeping@xcite or the irregular shape of the dot@xcite may contribute to the deviation of the experimental results from the wigner - dyson ( wd ) statistics predicted by the random matrix theory .",
    "however , the recent experiment with a stacked gate structure , which allows one to vary the electron density without significant deformation of the dot , was supportive of the claim that the observed shape of fluctuations originates from electron - electron interactions.@xcite another recent experiment reported the crossover behavior of the compressibility around the metal - insulator transition in two dimensions.@xcite    the influence of the magnetic field , either perpendicular@xcite or parallel,@xcite on the distribution of the inverse compressibility was also investigated experimentally . in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field",
    ", the shape of the distribution is found qualitatively similar to that in zero magnetic field , only with narrower width.@xcite there was an attempt to explain the qualitative behavior of peak positions in the system under the magnetic field;@xcite the considered classical model is based on the electrostatics of several electron islands with quantum orbitals , the energies of which depend on the external magnetic field .",
    "the possibility of nearly vanishing peak spacing was thus suggested , which is in qualitative agreement with the bunching of the addition spectra.@xcite however , it does not take into account the quantum interference effects between electron wave functions , which can be crucial in mesoscopic systems .    in this paper , we study numerically fluctuations of the inverse compressibility in the two - dimensional coulomb glass.@xcite to treat the interaction between electrons , we employ the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , which makes it possible to investigate larger samples than those feasible in exact diagonalization . for a systematic study , we first examine the classical system , revealing the detailed dependence of the inverse - compressibility fluctuations upon disorder and interaction .",
    "then the effects of electron hopping on the fluctuations are investigated .",
    "observed is an unusual right - biased distribution for very weak disorder and strong interactions as well as a symmetric gaussian - like distribution with non - gaussian tails .",
    "it is also found that relative fluctuations decrease eventually for sufficiently strong interactions , which appears to be inconsistent with the quadratic interaction dependence of the fluctuations suggested in a previous numerical study.@xcite we further examine the effects of magnetic fields , which introduce frustration to the system , on the distributions and fluctuations of the inverse compressibility , and observe that weak magnetic fields tend to suppress fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless the fluctuations may be enhanced in some range of the frustration for weak disorder and interaction",
    ". such opposite tendency of the inverse - compressibility fluctuations in response to the applied magnetic fields is explained in terms of the localization properties of the system .",
    "finally , it is also found that strong frustration suppresses significantly the effects of the interaction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : cs ] we consider the classical coulomb glass and investigate in detail the effects of disorder and interaction on the inverse - compressibility fluctuations .",
    "the effects of hopping on the fluctuations in the quantum coulomb glass are examined in sec .",
    "[ sec : qs ] .",
    "section  [ sec : mf ] is devoted to the effects of magnetic fields .",
    "we examine the system at both weak and strong frustration , and describe the electron distributions and localization properties by means of the participation ratio and the inverse participation number .",
    "the main results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : s ] .",
    "we address the hamiltonian for the classical coulomb glass model:@xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the site index on an @xmath2 square lattice , @xmath3 is the number operator of the electron at site @xmath1 , and @xmath4 is the random on - site potential uniformly distributed in the range @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "we assume the coulomb interaction potential between electrons : @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the dielectric constant . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ch ] ) @xmath8 represents the uniform neutralizing background charge per site in units of @xmath9 , which is demanded by the charge neutrality condition over the whole system . throughout this paper",
    "we concentrate on the half - filling case @xmath10 in the free boundary conditions , and write the distance in units of the lattice constant @xmath11 .    the ground state of the classical hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ch ] ) is obtained by means of simulated annealing procedure .",
    "the inverse compressibility @xmath12 for a given disorder configuration is then calculated via the relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denotes the @xmath16-electron ground - state energy .",
    "we have performed the calculation for size @xmath17 , 6 , and 8 , and averaged the data over 2000 different disorder configurations .",
    "figure  [ fig : cicmndv](a ) shows the average inverse compressibility as a function of the relative disorder strength @xmath18 . for weak disorder ,",
    "@xmath19 depends rather weakly on both the disorder strength @xmath20 and the size @xmath21 since @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath23 in this regime as shown in the inset .",
    "as the disorder is increased , @xmath19 is suppressed up to @xmath24 , then increases for @xmath25 , and approaches asymptotically the straight line describing the behavior in the corresponding noninteracting system .",
    "one can also observe that @xmath22 decreases with the system size , which is prominent for strong disorder .",
    "it is remarkable that the disorder - scaled average @xmath26 , which is plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : cicmndv](a ) , is monotonically increasing with @xmath27 , thus indicating that larger interactions lead to larger values of the inverse compressibility for given disorder strength .",
    "in contrast to the average @xmath22 , the fluctuations @xmath28 of the inverse compressibility , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cicmndv](b ) , scale with @xmath20 independently of @xmath23 for weak disorder as well as for strong disorder . in the crossover regime , on the other hand , the fluctuations display non - monotonic behavior , with a broad peak at @xmath29 .",
    "this becomes conspicuous as the system size grows : whereas for @xmath30 , @xmath28 decreases with the size similarly to @xmath22 , slight increase of @xmath28 can be observed for @xmath31 .",
    "it is of interest to note that @xmath28 approaches the noninteracting limit rather fast as @xmath18 is increased , demonstrating that for strong disorder ( @xmath32 ) the interaction merely shifts the average inverse compressibility toward slightly larger values .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cicrdv ] we plot the relative fluctuations @xmath33 of the inverse compressibility versus the relative disorder strength @xmath18 .",
    "the relative fluctuations in general grow with @xmath18 , saturating to a finite value in the noninteracting limit . at the point",
    "@xmath34 the relative fluctuations are apparently independent of the system size , which has been reported in previous numerical studies.@xcite however , it should be noted that such universal behavior shows up only at @xmath34 : while the relative fluctuations grow with the system size for @xmath35 , they are reduced by the increase of the system size for @xmath36 .",
    "again a broad peak , which becomes prominent for larger systems , is observed for @xmath29 ; this can be attributed to the presence of the peak in @xmath28 mentioned above .    in the limit of strong disorder ( @xmath32 ) ,",
    "the electrons are distributed spatially to minimize the total random potential energy , and firmly pinned , rarely rearrange their whole distribution in response to the addition or removal of an electron .",
    "consequently , as in the noninteracting system , both @xmath22 and @xmath28 are expected to increase with the disorder strength @xmath20 , while the interaction simply renormalizes the values slightly without qualitative change .",
    "note that such tendency begins at relatively small disorder @xmath37 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cicmndv ] .    in the opposite limit of strong interaction ( @xmath38 ) ,",
    "on the other hand , the half - filled electron state @xmath39 is expected to form a wigner crystal ( wc ) . in case that two wc states are nearly degenerate even in the presence of the disorder , the addition or removal of an electron can change the ground state into that similar to the other wc state ; however , the disorder configuration , which allows such phenomena , is very rare and accordingly , the wc state in general does not experience significant change by the insertion or extraction of an electron .",
    "the inverse compressibility can then be calculated as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is 0/1 for site @xmath1 empty / occupied in the state @xmath39 , and @xmath42 represents the site to / from which an electron is inserted / extracted . in this limit ,",
    "the interaction part plays a major role in choosing @xmath43 , which is very likely to be one of the corners .",
    "accordingly , the strength @xmath44 of the impurity at site @xmath43 is random and uncorrelated , leading to the disorder - independent average given by the third term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : siric ] ) ; this quantity decreases slightly with @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , the fluctuations arise mainly from the first two terms which have their origin in the random potential and thus increase with the disorder strength @xmath20 .",
    "the numerical data presented above are indeed in good agreement with these conclusions based on analytic argument .",
    "figure  [ fig : cicmndv ] demonstrates that this regime persists until @xmath45 .",
    "+    in both extreme limits considered above , one can see that the contributions of the random potential to the fluctuations of the inverse compressibility are dominant over those of the interaction . in the intermediate region",
    ", however , the behavior looks rather complicated and the interaction is expected to play an important role . for detailed investigation",
    ", we divide the intermediate region into three subregions : ( i ) @xmath46 , ( ii ) @xmath47 , and ( iii ) @xmath48 . in region",
    "i the half - filled state @xmath39 strongly depends on the disorder configuration : some states are still close to the wc state while others are rather disordered . in the latter states , the portion of which increases with @xmath18 , the distribution of electrons is inhomogeneous , reducing the coulomb energy cost of the addition or removal of one electron . on the other hand , the former states , which resemble the wc state ,",
    "rather easily rearrange the distribution of electrons by the addition or removal of an electron , unlike in the limit of strong interactions .",
    "both behaviors generally result in the reduction of @xmath12 although the amount of the reduction depends upon the disorder configuration ; this explains the change of the @xmath49 distribution from the @xmath50-function - like one [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : cicdis](a ) ] to the asymmetric broad distribution with a long left tail [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : cicdis](b ) ] .",
    "it is observed that the minimum of @xmath49 as well as the peak position of the distribution decreases with @xmath18 . indeed in a finite system the minimum of @xmath49 hits its lower bound given by the smallest possible coulomb interaction between successively inserted electrons,@xcite @xmath51 at @xmath52 . in addition , as @xmath18 is raised , the emergence of rather disordered states in turn leads to the increase of the fluctuations of @xmath49 , which is reflected as well in the correlations between @xmath53 and @xmath54 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cfdcor ] . in this regime",
    "the correlations are positive and increase with @xmath18 until @xmath52 , keeping parallel with the broader distribution of @xmath49 .",
    "[ recall that @xmath55 . ]",
    "such positive correlations may be understood via the argument that the presence of a dilute region in state @xmath39 , which lowers @xmath56 , accompanies a dense region , allowing a low cost of the electron extraction .",
    "it should be noted that large fluctuations in this regime arise from the interplay between the coulomb interaction and the random potential .",
    "the main feature of region ii is that essentially all the states are disordered . in this regime",
    "the disorder contributions become important in determining the electron configuration of @xmath39 , alleviating the need for rearrangement due to the insertion or extraction of an electron . the fluctuations @xmath57 $ ] , which increase or decrease very slightly depending on the system size , are not enough to explain the noticeable decrease of @xmath58 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cicmndv](b ) , suggesting that the correlations between them play a crucial role .",
    "figure  [ fig : cfdcor ] shows that the correlations decrease to negative values .",
    "this behavior , providing an evidence for the mounting role of the random potential , can be understood as follows : in the noninteracting case @xmath59 and @xmath60 are simply given by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , where @xmath63 is the @xmath16th smallest strength of the on - site potential in a disordered sample .",
    "the closeness of @xmath64 and @xmath65 gives positive correlations between them , thus leading to negative correlations between @xmath66 .",
    "this argument is expected to remain valid in the presence of sufficiently weak interactions .",
    "it is remarkable that such correlations indeed begin to show up in the regime of rather strong interactions .",
    "furthermore , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : cicdis](c ) and ( d ) , the distribution of @xmath49 is bounded below by the minimum of @xmath49 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cicmin ] ) , while the maximum of @xmath49 decreases with @xmath18 , accounting for the corresponding decrease of the fluctuations @xmath58 .",
    "finally , one can observe that region iii is characterized by weak dependence of @xmath19 , @xmath58 , and @xmath33 upon the disorder strength .",
    "although fluctuations of @xmath59 and of @xmath60 increase with @xmath18 , they are canceled out due to their negative correlations as disclosed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cfdcor ] .",
    "it should also be noted that the inverse - compressibility distribution follows the wd form throughout this regime [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : cicdis](e ) ] while the universal relative fluctuations reported in refs .   and emerge only for @xmath34 .    before closing this section ,",
    "we add a remark on the shape of the distribution of the inverse compressibility , which is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cicdis ] for several values of @xmath18 .",
    "the noninteracting system follows the pauli distribution , which changes to the wd distribution for @xmath48 as pointed out above .",
    "further decrease to @xmath67 generates quite a peculiar distribution : the asymmetric one with a peak biased to the right and a long tail in the left , which resembles neither the wd nor the gaussian distribution .",
    "as @xmath18 becomes even smaller , this distribution eventually reduces to the @xmath50-function distribution , manifesting the wc state .",
    "+    in this section we allow hopping of electrons between sites and investigate the corresponding quantum effects .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a quantum coulomb glass reads@xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69/@xmath70 is the creation / annihilation operator at site @xmath1 and the number operator is given by @xmath71 .",
    "the hopping of an electron is allowed only between nearest neighboring sites as indicated by the first term .",
    "we employ the hf approximation to treat the coulomb interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qh ] ) , and obtain @xmath72 apart from constant terms . the third and the fourth terms represent the direct and the exchange energies of the electron - electron interactions , respectively , and the angular brackets denote the expectation values with respect to the hf ground state , which should be determined in a self - consistent manner . during the iteration",
    "we use the method of potential mixing , where the averages over a few previous iterating steps are inserted into the expectation values in the hamiltonian ; this not only ensures convergence of the iteration but also helps to reduce iteration steps necessary for convergence .",
    "we have computed the inverse compressibility up to 2000 disorder configurations for several values of the hopping strength @xmath73 and the disorder strength @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ichdis ] displays the distribution of the inverse compressibility for various values of @xmath73 and @xmath18 , together with the distribution in the corresponding classical system . for small @xmath18 shown in figs .  [ fig : ichdis](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , as electron hopping comes into play , the peak position of the distribution moves toward smaller values of @xmath12 , with the probability for large @xmath12 reduced .",
    "one can see that for @xmath74 the presence of even very weak hopping produces a noticeable change in the distribution .",
    "+    indeed the clean system ( @xmath75 ) is observed to show rapid decrease of the inverse compressibility with the increase of the hopping strength , suggesting that the decrease of the probability for large @xmath12 originates from the interplay between the coulomb interaction and hopping .",
    "figure  [ fig : ichdis](d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) corresponding to @xmath76 , in contrast , demonstrates that the peak shifts slightly to the right and appears to saturate eventually as the hopping strength is increased .",
    "in addition , the probability for small @xmath12 is suppressed and the minimum of @xmath12 rises , which appears to begin at somewhat weaker disorder @xmath29 . recalling",
    "that such suppression in the probability for small @xmath12 is also observed in the noninteracting system , we can infer that random disorder plays a crucial role here .",
    "the effects of electron hopping are also manifested by the statistics of the inverse compressibility , which is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : icv ] . for @xmath77 , both @xmath22 and @xmath28 decrease with @xmath73 due to the reduction of the probability for large @xmath12",
    "; for @xmath78 , on the other hand , the suppression of small @xmath12 induces slight increase of @xmath22 and decrease of @xmath28 , which results in overall suppression of @xmath33 in the whole region .",
    "figure  [ fig : icvdis ] illustrates the interaction effects on the inverse - compressibility distribution for given hopping and disorder strength . as the interaction strength is increased , the peak in the distribution of the normalized inverse compressibility @xmath79 moves to the right both in the clean case ( @xmath80 ) and in the dirty case ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "here it is of interest to notice the growth of a tail in the left side .",
    "the increase of the interaction modifies the wd - like distribution to a symmetric one and even drives the distribution into a right - biased shape at sufficiently strong interactions [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : icvdis](c ) ] .",
    "the distribution returns to a symmetric narrow one upon further increase of the interaction .",
    "strong disorder in dirty samples , on the other hand , tends to suppress such influence of the interaction : growth of the left tail is retarded and the distribution remains in the left - biased shape even at strong interactions .",
    "several experiments@xcite reported that the distribution of the normalized inverse compressibility follows a roughly symmetric gaussian form with non - gaussian tails , which is very different from the wd distribution predicted by the random matrix theory .",
    "the interaction strength in those experiments is characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath82 to @xmath83 , which , via the relation @xmath84 with the filling factor @xmath85 , corresponds to @xmath86 to @xmath87 in our model .    in this interaction range and also at weaker interactions we have identified such a gaussian - like symmetric distribution as long as disorder is sufficiently weak ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "in addition to this symmetric distribution , we have also observed an interesting asymmetric right - biased distribution with long left tails for @xmath89 and @xmath90 [ see fig .",
    "indeed , such an asymmetric distribution , which also appears in fig .",
    "3(b ) for the classical system , has been observed experimentally@xcite in the samples with strong interactions @xmath91 and rather weak disorder .",
    "[ see fig .  3 in ref .",
    "] furthermore , we have obtained in this regime relative fluctuations smaller than the values @xmath92 obtained in previous numerical calculations;@xcite this allows one to explain the weak relative fluctuation @xmath93 observed in experiment@xcite without considering thermal broadening .",
    "all these observations thus support the conclusion that the peak spacing fluctuations in the coulomb blockade conductance originate mainly from charging energy fluctuations .",
    "we also investigate the effects of the interaction on the statistics of the inverse compressibility by computing the relative fluctuations , which are shown as a function of @xmath94 for several values of @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ichres ] .",
    "it is observed that particularly for intermediate disorder strengths a broad peak develops at a certain value of @xmath94 , which turns out to increase with @xmath95 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath33 at sufficiently strong interactions has its origin in the fast increase of @xmath22 as well as the decrease of @xmath28 with @xmath94 in this regime , where the half - filling state is close to the wc state .",
    "note here that such decrease was not observed in ref .  , which investigated the quarter - filled system and reported quadratic increase of the relative fluctuations with @xmath94 at strong interactions .",
    "in general stronger interactions are required for systems with smaller filling factors to form wc states , and accordingly it is expected that relative fluctuations begin to decrease at larger values of @xmath94 .",
    "we thus believe that further increase of the interaction strength should yield reduction of the relative fluctuations even in the quarter - filled case .",
    "finally , we check the validity of the hf approximation by comparing the hf results with those obtained via exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qh ] ) for small systems . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ln](a ) and ( b ) , which displays the statistics of @xmath12 obtained via the two methods in the system of @xmath17 , one can see that the hf results are in good agreement with the exact ones except for some parameter regions : for @xmath96 , observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ln](a ) is that the hf approximation overestimates @xmath22 for small @xmath97 . figure  [ fig : ln](b ) also shows such overestimation of the fluctuations in the hf approximation for the intermediate disorder strength @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the distribution function plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ln](c ) and ( d ) provides a clue to the overestimation : for @xmath100 corresponding to moderate disorder , the hf approximation generates more frequently large values of @xmath12 and hardly changes the minimum of @xmath12 , resulting in the overestimation of both @xmath22 and @xmath28 . on the other hand , for smaller @xmath74",
    "the overall distribution merely shifts to the right with the shape almost unchanged . accordingly , whereas the hf approximation tends to give larger values of @xmath22 , rather accurate values are obtained for @xmath28 in the case of small @xmath18 , as shown in fig .",

    "in this section we examine the effects of magnetic fields on the distribution and fluctuations of the inverse compressibility .",

    "in general , for large systems where the set of the degenerate frustration becomes very dense , the statistics of the inverse compressibility is expected to remain qualitatively unchanged irrespectively of the frustration , except around @xmath113 .",

    "this observation indicates that the electron profiles in the samples with smaller values of @xmath12 tend to be uniform and thus explains the increase of @xmath12 in the samples displaying relatively small @xmath12 since such uniform profiles should be sensitive to the change in frustration .",
    "localized states , on the other hand , are rather insensitive to frustration , and accordingly , the inverse compressibility in a sample with large @xmath12 remains unchanged . to be more definite in the electron state ,",
    "we have also calculated the ipn at the fermi level and observed positive correlations between the ipn and the inverse compressibility , thus confirming the above argument . in the case",
    "that hopping is dominant over the interaction and disorder , the samples mostly have large values of the participation ratio and low values of the ipn at the fermi level , implying sensitivity to frustration .",
    "variations of the sensitivity over the samples lead to the increase of width of the distribution .    as @xmath123 approaches @xmath112",
    ", the distribution reverses its behavior , restoring that at @xmath138 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the distributions at @xmath139 and at @xmath140 are not exactly the same .",
    "rather , the distribution at @xmath140 is similar to the one at @xmath141 .",
    "such difference between the distributions at different degenerate frustrations may be attributed to the difference of the degree of degeneracy : at @xmath139 the system has the @xmath21-fold degeneracy at half - filling@xcite but at @xmath140 two - fold degeneracy is present , as can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : free](a ) .",
    "since large degeneracy favors a smaller value of @xmath12 even in the presence of the interaction and disorder , the probability for small @xmath12 at @xmath139 is higher than that at @xmath140 , which is verified in numerical calculations .    to get more insight for large fluctuations at the degenerate frustration in relation to the localization property ,",
    "we have computed the average participation ratio @xmath142 , which is plotted as a function of @xmath123 for various interaction strengths in fig .",
    "[ fig : prwf ] . the conspicuous decrease in @xmath142 near the degenerate frustration signals an increase in spatial modulation or localization of the total electron density . indeed in a perfectly clean system",
    "the participation ratio is exactly equal to unity , irrespective of the frustration .",
    "as disorder is introduced , @xmath142 diminishes faster at the degenerate frustration . such spatial localization at the degenerate frustration or delocalization at non - degenerate frustration",
    "are believed to be related with the pattern of interference of electrons scattered at impurities : moving around the lattice under the magnetic field , the electrons acquire additional phases . at the degenerate frustration",
    "such phases are expected to enhance the constructive interference . in connection with the degeneracy we can imagine linear combinations of degenerate states at the fermi level",
    "; any combination will be an eigenstate of the clean system , and among them we can choose more modulated or localized one which leads to less energy in the presence of disorder . at the non - degenerate frustration",
    "such choice is not possible , yielding rather extended states .",
    "the sensitivity of electron states to disorder at the degenerate frustration in turn generates larger fluctuations of the inverse compressibility over the samples . in ref .",
    "the enhanced fluctuations of the inverse compressibility were also attributed to localization of the wavefunctions around the edge of the dot . here",
    "we stress that our argument is not restricted merely to the half - filling case which gives fairly high degeneracy at @xmath139 .",
    "figure  [ fig : free](a ) shows that there also exist many degenerate states at @xmath139 at other fillings .",
    "we conclude this section with some remarks on the comparison with the existing experiment . for the interaction and disorder which are sufficiently strong but not so strong to overwhelm quantum effects ,",
    "the fluctuations are observed to diminish with the frustration @xmath123 , provided that @xmath143 .",
    "this leads to similar decrease in relative fluctuations , even for weak disorder and interaction , owing to the increase in @xmath22 .",
    "this result agrees quite well with the experimental results mentioned in the beginning of this section .",
    "furthermore , the structure of the inverse - compressibility distribution has been found not to change appreciably , which also coincides with the experimental observation .      in the previous section ,",
    "we have examined the effects of weak magnetic fields , up to the first degenerate frustration @xmath112 , on fluctuations of the inverse compressibility .",
    "the arguments in the previous section as to the fluctuations at degenerate and non - degenerate frustrations seem to be applicable beyond @xmath112 as well .",
    "however , as the system size grows , the degenerate frustrations proliferate in number to spread over the entire region of the frustration and the energy splitting by the magnetic field at the fermi level also shrinks .",
    "accordingly , no distinctive difference is expected to appear in the distribution of @xmath12 at degenerate and non - degenerate frustrations .",
    "a remarkable exception happens at the full frustration ( @xmath113 ) , where quite large energy spacing is induced at the fermi level in the noninteracting clean system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : free ] ) . for even @xmath21 ,",
    "the energy spacing reads @xmath144,\\ ] ] which decreases to zero in the thermodynamic limit @xmath145 . nevertheless , for moderate @xmath21 the finite spacing given by eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) discerns the full frustration from other frustration values , yielding qualitative difference in the distribution even for strong interactions .",
    "the average inverse compressibility and its fluctuations are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : icff ] . for @xmath146 and @xmath87",
    ", one can notice the disappearance of both the lumps in @xmath124 and the overshoots in @xmath126 , which develop at weak disorder and strong interactions in the unfrustrated system ( @xmath139 ) . in secs .",
    "[ sec : cs ] and [ sec : qs ] , both the lumps in @xmath22 and the overshoots in @xmath28 have been found to have their origin in the wc states due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "accordingly , the disappearance of such lumps and overshoots implies that strong magnetic fields suppress the interaction effects on the electron distribution . to look into the distribution of the electrons ,",
    "we have compared the average participation ratio at @xmath139 and that at @xmath113 in fig .",
    "[ fig : prff ] .",
    "it is observed that the latter , @xmath147 , is always larger than the former , @xmath148 , with the difference significant for @xmath149 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath147 does not vary much with the interaction , up to @xmath86 ; even for @xmath150 , its values are not so different from the values for @xmath151 .",
    "we thus conclude that the full frustration restrains the modulation of electrons induced by the repulsive coulomb interaction between electrons and suppresses its influence on the fluctuations of the inverse compressibility .",
    "to verify the suppression of the coulomb interaction beyond the hf approximation , we compute the participation ratio as a function of the frustration parameter via the exact diagonalization method in the clean system with a single impurity of strength @xmath80 , located at a corner of the @xmath152 lattice , and plot the results for various values of @xmath94 in fig .  [",
    "fig : prcl ] .",
    "note that small values of the participation ratio indicate the formation of the wc - like states due to interactions .",
    "we have intentionally inserted an impurity in the system in order to eliminate the degeneracy , which allows the two ( degenerate ) wc states to superpose and may keep the participation ratio still larger even when the electrons form a wigner crystal . at @xmath139 and other degenerate frustration values , the average participation ratio is clearly shown to decrease with the interaction ; even rather weak interactions lead to appreciable reduction in the participation ratio . at the full frustration ,",
    "in contrast , the participation ratio does not reduce much even in the presence of substantial interactions , indicating that the fully frustrated system is reluctant to be in a wc state and thus confirming the above hf results .",
    "figure  [ fig : icdisff ] compares the distribution of @xmath12 at @xmath139 and that at @xmath113 . for @xmath146 and @xmath153 ,",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : icdisff](a ) , the width of the distribution at @xmath113 is much reduced compared with that at @xmath139 . here",
    "the ubiquity of large values of @xmath12 at @xmath113 comes not from the coulomb charging energy but from the large single - particle energy splitting due to the full frustration . on the other hand , for @xmath154 and @xmath128 , fig .",
    "[ fig : icdisff](b ) shows a wider distribution at @xmath113 , which may be attributed to the fluctuations of the degenerate states just above and below the fermi level : the energies of the degenerate states fluctuate severely according to the disorder configurations , resulting in large fluctuations of the inverse compressibility .",
    "we conclude this section with a comment on the validity of the hf approximation at @xmath113 . as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : prcl ] , the effects of the full frustration survive even in the presence of rather strong interactions , with the strength up to @xmath155 .",
    "such effects are , however , not disclosed in the average and fluctuations of the inverse compressibility calculated via the hf method ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : icff ] for @xmath155 ) .",
    "further , the average participation ratio obtained within the hf approximation in the same system as in fig .",
    "[ fig : prcl ] turns out to display considerable discrepancy at @xmath155 , which strongly suggests that the hf approximation breaks down for strong interactions @xmath156 .",
    "we have studied numerically the inverse compressibility and its fluctuations in two - dimensional coulomb glasses , with emphasis on the quantum effects associated with electron hopping as well as the frustration effects due to applied magnetic fields . for a systematic study of this problem ,",
    "we have begun with the corresponding classical system , revealing the detailed dependence of the inverse - compressibility fluctuations on the interaction and random disorder .",
    "then the effects of electron hopping on the distribution of the inverse compressibility have been examined , particularly with regard to the interplay with the interaction and disorder .",
    "the results , obtained mostly via the hartree - fock approximation , have been compared with those of existing experiments as well as of previous numerical studies : in addition to the symmetric gaussian distribution with non - gaussian tails , we have observed , in a sufficiently clean sample with strong interactions , a peculiar right - biased distribution of the inverse compressibility , which was indeed reported in experiment under similar situations .",
    "realization of even cleaner samples , where such an unusual distribution may be attainable with rather weak interactions , is thus expected to confirm the validity of our results and to clarify the role of interactions .",
    "remarkably , the relative fluctuations have been found to decrease eventually as the interaction strength is increased .",
    "this is contrary to the quadratic interaction dependence of the fluctuations , suggested in a previous numerical study .",
    "we have next investigated the effects of magnetic fields on the distribution and fluctuations of the inverse compressibility .",
    "weak frustration generally suppresses the fluctuations ; in a clean sample with weak interactions , however , fluctuations are enhanced in some range of the frustration .",
