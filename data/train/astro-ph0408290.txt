    "the galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) ctb  109  ( g109.21.0 ) was discovered in x - rays with _ einstein _  by @xcite . in the radio band , it was identified as an snr by @xcite in the galactic plane survey at @xmath1149  cm with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope .",
    "ctb  109  is the host remnant of the anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) 1e2259 + 586 with a spin period of @xmath12  s ( fahlman & gregory @xcite , @xcite ) and a spin - down rate of @xmath13  s  s@xmath6 @xcite . in 2002 , an outburst of 1e2259 + 586 occurred with bursts similar to soft gamma repeaters and with a sudden spin up of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the distance to the snr has been estimated from various observations as 3  6  kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . a distance of @xmath15  kpc has been derived by @xcite by measuring the spectroscopic distances and radial velocities of hiiregions and comparing those values to the radial velocity of ctb  109  measured by @xcite",
    "the remnant is embedded in a large complex of hii  regions which extends over 400  pc along the galactic plane .    at radio frequencies ,",
    "@xcite have derived a spectral index of @xmath16 , for flux density @xmath17 and frequency @xmath18 , which does not vary across the remnant .",
    "the remnant shell is incomplete in the west , both in radio and x - rays ( see fig.[color ] ) .",
    "bright spots are found around the rim , but the features do not correlate in the two bands .",
    "no radio point source is found at the position of the x - ray pulsar , which is displaced by 36 from the geometrical center of the radio shell .",
    "ctb  109  is located near a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) complex @xcite which contains five hii  regions . @xcite and @xcite have suggested that this gmc complex is associated with the snr based on co and @xmath19co observations .",
    "data from the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) of the rntgensatellit ( _ rosat _ ) confirm that there is no x - ray emission in the west ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rp97 ) .",
    "the snr shell does not extend further to the west behind the gmc in either radio or x - rays ; because absorption is negligible in the radio continuum , this implies that the semi - circular shape of the remnant is not due to absorption .",
    "more likely , the snr shock has been stopped by the gmc complex on one side . to the east",
    ", the interstellar medium ( ism ) density appears to be lower , as indicated in the hi  map of @xcite . in co ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath19co ( @xmath20 ) observations , have found an arm - like co ridge ( ` co arm ' ) which is anti - correlated with the x - ray emission .",
    "ctb  109  has a strikingly bright region in x - rays in the interior , the ` x - ray blob ' or the ` lobe ' . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the axp emits a jet and that the bright lobe is material excited by a jet or the jet itself .",
    "however , rho & petre ( @xcite , @xcite ) have shown that the _ rosat _ pspc spectrum of the lobe is thermal in origin and shows no evidence of synchrotron emission , arguing against a jet interpretation . @xcite",
    "have found no morphological evidence to support a pulsar jet origin for the lobe in the _ rosat _ high resolution imager ( hri ) data and conclude that the bright x - ray emission from the lobe is most likely caused by a density enhancement in material stripped from the cloud complex .",
    "finally , the _ chandra _  image @xcite reveals no morphological connection between the lobe and the axp .",
    "@xcite show that for parts of the shell , the x - ray spectrum is well fitted by a single - component thermal model , whereas for the lobe and the northern and the southern part of the shell , two thermal components are required .",
    "a _ bepposax",
    "_  low - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) spectrum of the whole snr excluding the pulsar and the lobe has been analyzed by .",
    "the parameters of the best fit to the lecs data with a non - equilibrium model are @xmath21  kev and the ionization timescale @xmath22  @xmath2  s.    surveys of galactic snrs have been performed with the infrared astronomical satellite ( _ iras _ ) , revealing infrared emission from ctb  109@xcite .",
    "the data in the wavelength bands of 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100  @xmath23 m show a dense dust cloud which is correlated with bright hii  regions , located in the south and west of the remnant @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an enhancement in infrared emission is found between the lobe and the north - east shell .",
    "optical emission is detected mainly near the bright northeastern and southern radio emission @xcite .",
    "spectra of filamentary structures in the south confirm their shock origin @xcite . h@xmath24 and [ oiii ] images of @xcite",
    "reveal previously unknown filaments , e.g. faint filaments near the projected center of the remnant , along the southwestern edge of the bright lobe . from the filament spectra , they derive a shock velocity of @xmath25  km  s@xmath6 and pre - shock cloud densities of 5  20  @xmath2 .",
    "we have undertaken observations of ctb  109  with the _ xmm - newton_observatory to provide the deepest x - ray image of this snr and to provide the highest quality x - ray spectral data to date .",
    "the primary objectives of our analysis are to determine the evolutionary parameters of the remnant assuming it is in the sedov phase and to determine the nature of the lobe emission .",
    "the deep x - ray images are used to study the morphology of this remnant in comparison to the data at other wavelengths and to search for any morphological connection between the pulsar and the lobe .",
    "the high quality spectral data are used to determine the evolutionary parameters of the remnant ( age , shock velocity , ambient density ) and to search for spectral variations within the remnant .",
    "the evolutionary parameters determined from the x - ray spectral fits provide useful constraints not only on the age and the environment in which the remnant formed but also for the pulsar .",
    "this is particularly useful for the axp since there is no other reliable technique for estimating the age of this object @xcite .",
    "the detailed spectral fits of the shell and the lobe provide useful insights into the nature of the lobe emission .",
    "in particular , the high - quality spectra of the lobe are used to determine if the abundances are enhanced ( evidence of ejecta ) , if there is a nonthermal component , and if the temperature and ionization state of the plasma is similar to that of the shell .",
    "we have observed ctb  109  with three pointings of the x - ray multi - mirror mission in the ao1 period covering the southern ( hereafter : pointing s ) , northern ( pointing n ) , and eastern parts ( pointing e ) .",
    "we analyze data from the european photon imaging cameras ( epic ) pn , epic mos1 , and epic mos2 .",
    "the exposure times , after removing flares and periods of high background , are @xmath2610  ks .",
    "furthermore , we have access to observation 0038140101 ( pi : v.  kaspi , hereafter pointing p1 ) , with a net integration time of 34  ks for mos1/2 .",
    "we also analyze the target of opportunity ( too ) dataset of the pulsar 1e2259 + 586 in the _ xmm - newton _  archive ( obs .",
    "i d 0155350301 , hereafter p2 ) with 17  ks of mos2 data in full frame mode .",
    "the mos1 was in partial window mode , covering only the pulsar . in observations",
    "p1 and p2 , the pn was in small window mode .",
    "therefore , we do not consider the pn data of the observation p1 and the pn and mos1 data of observation p2 in our analysis .",
    "observation details of the datasets used are listed in table [ obstab ] .",
    "starting from the observational data files ( odfs ) , the data are processed with _",
    "xmm - newton _  science analysis system ( xmmsas ) version 5.4.1 . for epic pn ,",
    "only single and double pattern events are used , whereas for the mos1 and 2 , singles to quadruples are selected .",
    "the snr has been fully covered in five pointings with different directions ( three for the shell and two centered on the pulsar ) .",
    "we therefore merge the images from the different pointings to obtain complete exposure corrected images of the remnant using the procedure emosaic .",
    "for all the pointings , events are selected in the energy bands : 0.3  0.9  kev , 0.9  1.5  kev , 1.5  4.0  kev , and 4.0  kev  12.0  kev .",
    "images are created with a bin size of 4  and smoothed with circular gaussian function that has a sigma of 3 pixels in both dimensions ra and dec . in the 4.0  kev  12.0  kev images , only significant emission from the pulsar is seen , but not from the rest of the snr .",
    "figure [ color ] shows a mosaic image in the energy band of 0.3  4.0  kev in false color .",
    "the remnant s x - ray emission fades off to the west , lacking a clearly defined edge . in the interior ,",
    "the lobe is brighter than any part of the shell and there are dark regions north and south of the lobe .",
    "the lobe emission is well separated from the pulsar .",
    "we estimate the distance of the shell from the pulsar in the mosaic image by fitting a circle centered on the pulsar to each sector and obtain : 185 for the eastern shell , 173 for the southern shell , and 166 for the northern shell .",
    "thus , the eastern shell has the largest projected distance from the pulsar .",
    "as no emission from the remnant is found above 4  kev except from the pulsar , we create images in the energy bands below 4  kev in order to identify possible spectral variations within the remnant .",
    "the images in the bands red ( r ) = 0.3  0.9  kev , green ( g ) = 0.9  1.5  kev , and blue ( b ) = 1.5  4.0  kev are combined into an rgb mosaic image ( fig.[truecolor ] ) .",
    "we then use this image to guide our selection of regions to be examined more closely through detailed spectral fitting .",
    "the selected regions are shown in figure [ regions ] .",
    "the shell is slightly redder than the interior and has some red clumps .",
    "there is a small sector of the shell with lower emission in the northeast , coinciding with a bright region in the radio continuum @xcite .",
    "next to this region , there are red knots in the rgb composite image of the x - ray shell ( regions 5 and 6 in fig.[regions ] ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a larger red spot in the south ( region 15 ) .",
    "there are also color variations within the lobe , the outskirts being redder than the central part of the lobe .",
    "in addition to the very bright pulsar , fainter point sources are found in and around the remnant .",
    "two point sources located southeast of the remnant appear red in the rgb composite image .",
    "the one further east at ra = 23@xmath2703@xmath2819.6@xmath29 , dec = + 584529  ( j2000.0 ) is a star of the spectral type g5.5:v ( usno - a2.0 1425 - 14515707 , * ? ? ? * ) and is coincident with source no 3 in rp97 . the other source at ra = 23@xmath2702@xmath2843.7@xmath29 , dec = + 583746  ( j2000.0 ) is coincident with source no 4 in rp97 ; it is also coincident with a point source in the dss image . presumably , it is also a galactic star .",
    "the point sources close to the pulsar ( in projection ) have blue or violet colors .",
    "the source at ra = 23@xmath2700@xmath2833.3@xmath29 , dec = + 585245  ( j2000.0 ) located west of the pulsar is usno - a2.0 1425 - 14436845 ( no 1 in rp97 ) , a star of the spectral type g9.5:iii - iv .",
    "the source at ra = 23@xmath2700@xmath2843.3@xmath29 , dec = + 585028  ( j2000.0 ) south of usno - a2.0 1425 - 14436845 , is only known as an x - ray source ( no 2 in rp97 ) .",
    "there is an optical point source on the dss image at the x - ray position .",
    "therefore , these hard point sources seem to be galactic stars as well .",
    "enhanced column density in the foreground or high intrinsic absorption seems to be responsible for the hard spectrum .",
    "we extracted spectra for these point sources , but the low number of counts does not allow detailed spectral fitting .",
    "since ctb  109  is a relatively faint diffuse object , a good knowledge of the background is crucial for the spectral analysis .",
    "we studied the background properties of the epic cameras based on the treatments of @xcite , , and .    in the case of a point source",
    "a local background extracted from another region of the same data as the source can be used . for extended objects ,",
    "it is not possible to obtain background data at small distances from the source , i.e.  a few arcseconds away from the source like for point or point - like sources .",
    "instead one has to extract the background data far from the target , from a part of the detector that is not illuminated by source emission . in this case",
    "the distance between the source and the background region is large ( few arcminutes ) and the difference of the detector background at the two positions could become significant ( see next paragraph ) . in the case of a diffuse source that fills the entire field of view , it is even impossible to estimate the local background from the same data . if one selects a background region far from the source itself , many effects can produce an inappropriate background due to the different chip position : first , the effective area of the mirrors depends on the off - axis angle .",
    "photons are subject to vignetting , but particles are not .",
    "second , high - energy particles which interact with material surrounding the detector produce fluorescence , the magnitude of this fluorescence emission can vary significantly with position on the detector , especially for the pn detector .",
    "third , the spectral response depends on the position on the detector , especially for the pn .",
    "the internal ` quiescent ' background of the epic cameras consists of fluorescence lines and events produced by charged particles .",
    "the fluorescence depends on the camera body materials and the incident flux of high energy charged particles .",
    "therefore , the fluorescent component varies with position on the detector and with time .",
    "in addition , the high energy charged particles can produce background events directly in the detector .",
    "finally , low energy protons can reflect off of the mirror surfaces and reach the detectors in the focal plane .",
    "the background produced by low energy protons is highly variable in time for the _ xmm - newton _  instruments .",
    "there are two types of background template files available that can be used for the analysis of epic data : ` closed ' data and blank sky data .",
    "` closed ' data have been obtained with the filter wheel in the ` closed ' position ; these data include only the internal detector background .",
    "however , this instrument configuration is not representative of the usual observation where the ccds are exposed to photons and low energy charged particles . for the blank sky data , datasets for different pointings",
    "have been merged for each epic camera after eliminating sources from the data .",
    "these datasets comprise the detector background and an average cosmic x - ray background .",
    "since the background component due to high energy charged particles is included in these data at an unknown level , we need to model it using the spectral shape determined from the closed data .        although the cosmic x - ray background is a significant uncertainty in the blank sky data , we decide to use the blank sky instead of the ` closed ' data , because the latter have poor photon statistics and are therefore not suitable for extracting small regions .",
    "we use the blank sky data of the background analysis group in birmingham , uk , because they have data for both the medium and the thin filters , as well as for the full frame and extended full frame pn modes .",
    "the birmingham group have also developed scripts that can be used for the background analysis .",
    "the script skycast converts the detector coordinates of the template background datasets into sky coordinates using the pointing direction of the observation to be analyzed and adds sky coordinates to the background data .",
    "the script createspectra extracts spectra in specified circular ( or annular ) regions from the data and background - file .",
    "ancillary response files ( arfs ) and redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) are produced for the corresponding detector regions using the xmmsas commands arfgen and rmfgen .",
    "since the source spectrum and associated blank sky background spectrum are created at the same position of the detector , the arf and rmf are correct for both source and background .",
    "spectra are analyzed with xspec ver .",
    "we read in the source and the blank sky background spectra as two datasets : source ( 1 ) , background ( 2 ) .",
    "we model the background spectrum as a combination of a powerlaw component and two raymond & smith ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rs ) components with temperatures @xmath30 = 0.08  kev and 0.2  kev .",
    "zero - width gaussians are used to reproduce the fluorescence lines of the detector .",
    "the detector background is modeled with a powerlaw component and gaussians using the xspec option ` /b ' to suppress the application of the arf .",
    "an additional thermal component is used to model the snr emission ( set to zero for the background dataset ) . in figure",
    "[ soubgspectra ] , the epic pn and mos1/2 spectra of region 1 ( see fig.[regions ] ) extracted from the e pointing are displayed together with the corresponding blank sky background spectra .",
    "we show the spectrum from region 1 since this is the faintest part of the lobe , and hence the most sensitive to the background subtraction .    in order to convince ourselves that the background in the source spectrum can be well estimated from the blank sky data , we compare the spectra extracted as source ( from observations ) and background ( from blank sky data ) in a region outside the snr . both for pn and for mos1/2",
    ", the off - remnant spectrum from observations matches the blank sky spectrum very well in the softer ( @xmath31  kev ) and harder ( @xmath32  kev ) bands as well as for the fluorescence lines .",
    "there is a small excess in the off - remnant spectrum between @xmath33 and 1.5  kev .",
    "this faint emission is well fitted with a thermal model component and is likely galactic diffuse x - ray emission . since the remnant spectrum dominates the background spectrum in the 0.6  1.5  kev band ( see fig.[soubgspectra ] ) , using the blank sky data as background introduces only a small systematic uncertainty in the derived parameters for the remnant spectra .",
    "we verify this by modeling the spectra of regions in the remnant shell including an additional thermal component for the local diffuse x - ray background , as derived from the off - remnant spectrum .",
    "the parameters of the model component for the remnant emission ( foreground absorption , temperature , and ionization timescale , see   [ specana ] ) are consistent with results from the fit using only the blank sky data as background .",
    "the abundances of the elements with emission lines in this energy band ( o , ne , and mg ) also yield fit results that agree well with the results without the additional component , i.e.  solar abundances . consequently , the use of the blank sky data as background should have little effect on our determination of the neutral hydrogen column density and on the temperature of the thermal component .",
    "since the existing version of arfgen only computes arf files for circular and annular extraction regions , our analysis has been largely limited to circular regions .",
    "however , the xmmsas command evigweight calculates the vignetting correction for each event and thus one can use the on - axis arf . in order to subtract the non - vignetted events from the observation data ,",
    "it is better to use the ` closed ' data for the background , as this dataset only consists of the non - vignetted component , which is the internal detector background , and thus includes no additional external background emission .",
    "compared to the blank sky data , the ` closed ' data have far poorer statistics .",
    "therefore , we use this method only for non - circular extraction regions .    after computing the weight factor for the vignetting correction for each event , spectra are extracted from the new event files and rmfs are created with rmfgen .",
    "the source data still include the non - vignetted events which have not passed through the x - ray telescope , but now have a weighting factor applied .",
    "this misapplication of the weighting factor to non - vignetted events can be compensated for by applying the same weights to the ` closed ' background data .",
    "coordinates of the ` closed ' data are converted into the corresponding sky position using skycast . the vignetting correction weights are computed for the ` closed ' data . finally , spectra are extracted in the same regions as for the observed source data . again",
    "the background spectrum is used as second dataset and modeled as in   [ speccirc ] .      in order to check for consistency between the two methods for creating spectral data , spectra of the lobe regions ( see   [ sectlobe ] ) , extracted from the pointing e data ,",
    "are analyzed using both methods and compared .",
    "for the first method , we use the blank sky data as background data and create the arf with arfgen . for the second method , the event files are vignetting - corrected with evigweight and on - axis arf and ` closed ' background data are used .",
    "all the fitted parameters derived from the two methods agree within 90% confidence limits .",
    "therefore , we are confident that either method may be used without introducing systematic errors which dominate over the statistical errors .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic data allow us to perform spatially resolved spectral analysis of the snr .",
    "extraction regions are shown in figure [ regions ] on the 0.3  4.0  kev mosaic image .",
    "datasets and extraction regions are selected as follows :    * as we have shown in ",
    "[ intensmap ] , the eastern part of the shell is farthest from the pulsar .",
    "since it is located opposite to the gmc complex in the west , the eastern shell segment most likely indicates a blast wave propagating into a lower - density ism @xcite . for the spectral analysis",
    ", we cover the eastern shell with three circular regions ( 7  9 ) and also arc regions for comparison .",
    "in addition , we extract spectra for regions next to the radio bright knot in the northeast ( regions 5 and 6 ) .",
    "dataset e is used for all these analyses . *",
    "the shell is brightest in the northern part ; it has been covered completely by pointing n. we select circular regions from this dataset centered on the brighter knots ( regions 12 and 13 ) and also analyze interior regions close to the northern shell for comparison ( regions 11 and 14 ) . * in the southern part of the shell which does not have as clearly a defined edge as the eastern or the northern portions of the shell , we study the epic spectra ( using observation s ) for two regions ( 15 , 16 ) with soft emission ( see rgb composite image , fig.[truecolor ] ) . * in co observations , an enhancement of co gas has been found which extends from the gmc in the west across the northern part of the remnant .",
    "this dense material is called the co arm .",
    "its position and shape coincides well with an x - ray faint interior region , north of the pulsar and the lobe ( see fig.[color ] ) .",
    "spectra are analyzed for a large circular region ( 10 ) as well as for a non - circular region which follows the shape of the very low emission region .",
    "data from observations n and p1 are used .",
    "* the interior of the remnant has remarkably low surface brightness in the south ( ` dark interior ' ) .",
    "this region is analyzed using the p1 data which have the longest exposure time .",
    "* we extract spectra for four regions of the lobe ( regions 1  4 in fig.[regions ] ) from the observations e , p1 , and p2 , in order to look for spectral variations .",
    "all the epic spectra are analyzed in xspec using an energy range of 0.3  10.0  kev .",
    "the spectra are grouped with a minimum of 20 counts per bin and the @xmath34 statistic is used .",
    "the errors quoted are 90% confidence limits .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ soubgspectra ] , the emission above @xmath35  kev is mainly background emission and is crucial for estimating the background .",
    "although we select the energy range of 0.3  10.0  kev for spectral fitting , we will only show the spectrum below 4  kev in the following figures in order to clearly display the snr emission .    for analyzing the _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic spectra we use the following models : vmekal , which describes an emission spectrum for hot ionized gas in collisional ionization equilibrium with variable abundances , and vnei , which is a model for a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) collisional plasma , again with variable abundances @xcite .",
    "the vnei model includes a parameter for the ionization timescale , @xmath36 , an integral over the time since the gas was shocked . in addition",
    ", we modeled some regions in the shell with the model vpshock for a constant temperature , plane - parallel shock which includes a range of ionization timescales , parameterized by the lower limit and the upper limit of the @xmath37 range ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  epic spectra of region 3 in the lobe extracted from the pointing e data ( with vnei model fits ) are presented in figure [ lobespectra ] .",
    "emission line features corresponding to the mgxi  triplet and the sixiii  triplet are easily visible .",
    "moreover , the nex  ly@xmath24 line can be clearly seen in the mos data , as the energy resolution of mos is slightly better than that of pn .",
    "we first fit the spectra with free abundances .",
    "for all the spectra , the abundances for all the elements are consistent with solar abundances .",
    "we thereupon fix the abundances to solar values in order to reduce the number of free parameters and hopefully to better constrain the remaining free parameters . only mg and si are still kept free , because these abundances have appeared to differ slightly from solar values for some regions and the line features are evident in the epic spectra .",
    "we allowed the si and mg abundances to vary independently .",
    "for other elements like ne or s , it is too difficult to distinguish between line and continuum emission in the corresponding energy intervals .",
    "all the epic spectra are fitted better by a single - temperature vnei model than by a collisional ionization equilibrium vmekal model . in the following ,",
    "we present only the vnei results for all the regions , and discuss the vpshock results for shell spectra where we expect the least disturbed plane - parallel shock .",
    "tables [ mostab ] and [ evigwtab ] summarize the results of the spectral analysis of mos1/2 data , using the vnei model .",
    "spectra of some selected regions with the best fit vnei model are displayed in the following figures : figure [ lobespectra ] shows the pn and mos1/2 spectra of the brightest part of the lobe ( region 3 ) , the spectra in figure [ eastshellspectra ] are extracted from a bright region in the shell ( region 5 ) , and figure [ coarmspectra ] shows the heavily absorbed spectra of the co arm . in all these plots ,",
    "the non - background - subtracted source spectra are shown , but not the simultaneously modeled background spectra .",
    "the parameters of the vnei model for the lobe data of the pointing e , with the spectra from the two epic detector types pn and mos fitted separately , are consistent with the mos results of the lobe regions in table [ mostab ] except that the mg and si abundances from the pn fits turn out to be sub - solar in some regions .",
    "the most likely explanation for this discrepancy between pn and mos is the calibration issue addressed in the epic calibration status documentation of april 2003 @xcite : in the range from 0.3  1.0  kev , the pn flux is up to 10% higher than the mos flux , whereas above 1.5  kev , the mos flux is up to 10% higher . in the epic spectra ,",
    "most of the emission lines can not be resolved due to moderate spectral resolution .",
    "this complicates the determination of the continuum . assuming the same temperature and absorption , the flux inconsistency between the mos and the pn can mimic lower abundances for the pn data for elements like mg and si with lines above @xmath38  kev , because the unresolved lines can not be distinguished from the continuum .",
    "although most of the fit parameters ( absorption , temperature , ionization timescale ) for the pn , mos1 , and mos2 spectra are consistent , the discrepancy between the abundances makes us conclude that the results from the mos data ( mos1 and mos2 data fitted simultaneously , if data of both instruments are available ) are more reliable than the pn results in terms of abundances .",
    "therefore , we list the mos1/2 results in tables [ mostab ] and [ evigwtab ] .",
    "the eastern part of the remnant shell is farthest from the pulsar 1e2259 + 586 and has a more circular shape .",
    "the density of the ambient ism is apparently lower on this side @xcite .",
    "thus the eastern portion of the shell seems to be the best region to study the least perturbed shock - ism interaction .",
    "the spectral analysis of regions in the eastern shell ( regions 6 - 9 ) yields a temperature of @xmath33  kev for the vnei model , which is slightly higher than those in the lobe and the northern portion of the shell , though not significantly .",
    "the mg and si abundances are consistent with solar , and the ionization timescale is @xmath39  s  @xmath2 , similar to that in the northern part of the shell ( see   [ northshell ] ) .",
    "the absorbing column density is  = @xmath40  @xmath4 .",
    "we also analyze the spectra of the regions in the eastern shell using the model vpshock .",
    "the values for , @xmath30 , and the abundances agree well with the results of the vnei model in all four regions .",

    "given the large intensity variations within the remnant , it is somewhat surprising that none of the brighter regions shows evidence of enhanced abundances .",
    "it may be the case in ctb  109  that the ejecta mass is relatively low and the current amount of swept - up matter is relatively high such that the ejecta will be difficult to detect .",
    "although x - ray emission from ejecta is generally observed in snrs up to an age of a few @xmath165  yr , there are remnants younger than ctb  109  which show no evidence for ejecta . for example",
    ", kes  79 is estimated to be @xmath166  yr old and has no obvious emission from ejecta @xcite .",
    "as @xcite have shown , the co emission stretches from the giant molecular cloud both north and south of ctb  109 . in the optical band , filamentary structures have been found that are located at the rim of faint hii  regions north and southeast of the snr . at the position of the filaments , the hii  regions overlap with the remnant in projection .",
    "this suggests that the optical emission is mainly caused by the interaction of the remnant with dense material harboring the hii  regions @xcite .",
    "the diffuse hii  regions are probably associated with the outskirts of the molecular cloud complex to the west . from [ sii ] line ratios , @xcite derive pre - shock cloud densities of up to @xmath167  @xmath2 for the optical filaments .",
    "new hi  and co data @xcite make it clear that the remnant is located in a density gradient : very high density in the molecular cloud in the west and low density in the emission gap in the east of the snr . as @xcite point out",
    ", the hi   map indicates that the snr is not expanding inside a stellar wind bubble , since there is no evidence for a lower density cavity in hi  with a pronounced rim .",
    "have performed two - dimensional numerical hydrodynamical calculations for the evolution of a supernova remnant in or near a molecular cloud .",
    "if a supernova with an initial energy of @xmath168  ergs occurs in a low density interstellar medium ( 1  @xmath2 ) , the remnant shell becomes radiative after @xmath169  yr when it has reached a radius of @xmath170  pc .",
    "however , if the explosion occurs in a molecular cloud which has a higher density ( @xmath165  @xmath2 ) , the sedov phase is shorter ( @xmath171  yr ) and @xmath172 smaller . in the case of a supernova explosion inside a molecular cloud ,",
    "a break - out occurs if the shock reaches the edge of the cloud . for ctb  109 ,",
    "the position of the pulsar and the shell relative to the gmc complex as well as the semi - circular shape of the shell indicate that the supernova explosion was presumably located outside and close to a giant molecular cloud .",
    "as make clear in their calculations , a reflected shock forms from the cloud surface if the explosion takes place outside the cloud , but the shock transmitted into the cloud is weak and has a minor effect on the cloud surface . the reflected shock can cause an additional velocity component to the expansion of the snr , directed away from the cloud . @xcite have modeled ctb  109  as a supernova explosion near ( 2  pc ) a large molecular cloud , assuming an initial energy of @xmath148  ergs , an interstellar medium density of @xmath147  @xmath2 , and a cloud density of @xmath173  @xmath2 .",
    "they reproduce a semi - circular shell of the observed size at the age of @xmath146  yr .",
    "the deep epic mosaic image of ctb  109  confirms that there is no emission in the western part of the remnant . in combination with the morphology of the remnant in the radio",
    ", this indicates that the shock wave has been stopped completely in the west .",
    "however , no indication has been found for a molecular shock in the gmc ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "it is possible that there is enough material in unshocked parts of the gmc which lie in front of the interaction region such that any emission from this region could be absorbed .",
    "hard point sources discovered in the x - ray faint parts of the snr (   [ rgbima ] ) also suggest the existence of absorbing material in front of the snr .      our analysis of the _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic data shows that the spectral properties of the lobe are very similar to those of the remnant shell .",
    "moreover , the merged _ xmm - newton _  image ( fig.[color ] ) corroborates that the lobe and the pulsar are not related morphologically , confirming that the lobe is not a jet phenomenon .",
    "@xcite have suggested that , due to the interaction between the snr and the gmc in the west , a reflected shock has propagated into the snr .",
    "rayleigh - taylor instabilities might have formed between the thin snr plasma and the dense gmc , possibly producing a structure such as the lobe .",
    "another possibility is that there are denser clouds in the outer parts of the gmc complex that have been shocked by the snr blast wave . in projection , the lobe and the bright knots in the northern part of the remnant seem to trace the outer boundary of the co arm , and therefore might be emission from shocked interstellar clouds on the outskirts of the gmc complex .",
    "@xcite point out that a density fluctuation in the pre - shock gas might have resulted in a local excess of the post - shock emission measure seen as the lobe .",
    "they estimate that a cloud with a density 2  5 times higher than the average pre - shock density in the ambient medium could have produced the lobe .",
    "however , they find no evidence of co gas accelerated by the snr shock wave . in the far - infrared ,",
    "@xcite have found a region with bright emission northeast of the lobe .",
    "this region also coincides with the eastern edge of the co arm extending from the western molecular cloud complex , which suggests that this emission is caused by a shocked cloud . @xcite",
    "have found optical filaments at the southwestern edge of the lobe , i.e.  closer to the center of the remnant .",
    "all the other optical filaments detected in their observations are located along the northern and southern shell of the remnant and seem to be the result of the snr interacting with material associated with the hii  regions in the north and the south .",
    "usually , optical filaments are believed to be thin , shocked regions tangent to the line of sight .",
    "since the diffuse optical emission in the north extends southward to the position of the lobe , they suggest that the central filamentary emission arises from shocked gas along the projected edge of an interstellar cloud . assuming a shock velocity of 100  km  s@xmath6",

    "the cloud fragments due to the interaction .",
    "this is also observed in three - dimensional simulations by @xcite , who in addition show that the morphology of the cloud after the interaction depends strongly on the initial shape of the cloud . @xcite",
    "have performed a laboratory experiment using the nova high energy density laser at lawrence livermore national laboratory in order to study the interaction of a shock wave with a high - density sphere located in a low - density medium .",
    "they confirm that the evolution of the sphere after the interaction depends on the density ratio of the high - density to low - density medium , @xmath175 , and the mach number of the shock wave , as shown by @xcite . the high - density sphere ( @xmath176 ) is destroyed by the interaction with a shock wave with a mach number of 10 .    in order to better understand the possible origin of the lobe emission in ctb  109 we estimate cloud densities from the results of",
    "_ xmm - newton _  observations based on analytical estimates by @xcite for a planar shock - cloud interaction : there are two limiting cases , the ` cold ' cloud case and the ` hot ' cloud case , depending on the cooling time scale in the post - shock cloud gas relative to the crossing time for the transmitted cloud shock .",
    "a critical density is estimated by equating the cooling time and the shock crossing time : @xmath177 where @xmath73 is the ratio of the pressure behind the transmitted cloud shock and the pressure in the shocked ambient ism , @xmath178 the shock velocity ( in km  s@xmath6 ) , @xmath100 the ambient pre - shock density ( in @xmath2 ) , and @xmath179 the size of the cloud ( in pc ) . for a density contrast of @xmath180 = 10 , 100 , and @xmath181 , @xmath73",
    "is 2.6 , 4.4 , and 6.0 , respectively @xcite .",
    "if the cloud is denser than @xmath182 , the shocked cloud gas cools rapidly ( ` cold ' cloud ) and , after having reached a temperature below @xmath183  k , it produces line emission of lower ionization stages of the constituent elements . in the ` hot ' cloud case ,",
    "the cloud density is lower than @xmath182 and the temperature is still higher than @xmath184  k when the transmitted shock reaches the end of the cloud .",

    "as can be seen in figure [ ncrit ] , for @xmath190 we would have the ` cold ' cloud case for all clouds with @xmath191  pc .",
    "however , the observed soft x - ray emission from the lobe indicates a ` hot ' cloud case .",
    "if we assume a cloud size @xmath179 = 1  pc and a density contrast @xmath175 = 10 , equation ( [ critdens ] ) yields a critical density of @xmath192  @xmath2 , while a cloud size of @xmath179 = 0.5  pc with @xmath175 = 10 results in @xmath193  @xmath2 .",

    "we have studied the galactic snr ctb  109  using epic data of five _ xmm - newton _   pointings .",
    "the deep epic image , created from all of these observations , shows no emission in the western part of the shell .",
    "this confirms that the remnant has its semi - circular morphology because the progress of the shock wave has been stopped by the gmc .",
