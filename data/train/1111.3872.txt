    "note that the upper part of this mass range is close the gut scale , which is important for recent work on the connection of leptogenesis , gravitino dark matter and hybrid inflation @xcite .",
    "secondly , this result allows us to fix the parameter @xmath54 in the following computations without introducing a significant bias .    in the main run , for fixed @xmath54 , we include the mixing matrix @xmath42 of the charged leptons to compute the full pmns matrix .",
    "we require the mass ratios of the charged leptons to fulfill the experimental constraints up to an accuracy of @xmath61 and allow for @xmath62 to achieve the correct normalization of the charged lepton mass spectrum . finally , imposing the @xmath63 constraints on the two large mixing angles of the full pmns matrix",
    ", we find parameter sets of @xmath12 factors which yield mass matrices fulfilling the constraints in eq .  .",
    "our final results are based on roughly 20000 such hits .",
    "for each hit we calculate the observables in the neutrino sector as well as parameters relevant for leptogenesis .",
    "the resulting distributions are discussed below .",
    "_ statistical analysis _    in our theoretical setup the relative frequency with which we encounter a certain value for an observable might indicate the probability that this value is actually realized within the large class of flavour models under study . in the following",
    "we shall therefore treat the distributions for the various observables as probability densities for continuous random variables .",
    "that is , our predictions for the respective observables represent best - guess estimates according to a probabilistic interpretation of the relative frequencies .    for each observable we would like to deduce measures for its central tendency and statistical dispersion from the respective probability distribution .",
    "unfortunately , it is infeasible to fit all obtained distributions with one common template distribution .",
    "such a procedure would lack a clear statistical justification , and it also appears impractical as the distributions that we obtain differ substantially in their shapes .",
    "we therefore choose a different approach .",
    "we consider the median of a distribution as its centre and we use the @xmath64 ` confidence ' interval around it as a measure for its spread .",
    "of course , this range of the confidence interval is reminiscent of the @xmath65 range of a normal distribution .",
    "more precisely , for an observable @xmath66 with probability density @xmath67 we will summarize its central tendency and variability in the following form @xcite , @xmath68 here , @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the @xmath71- and @xmath72-quantiles with respect to the density function @xmath67 .",
    "the central value @xmath73 is the median of @xmath67 and thus corresponds to its @xmath74-quantile .",
    "all three values of @xmath66 can be calculated from the quantile function @xmath75 , @xmath76 : p \\leq f(x)\\right\\ } \\,,\\quad f(x ) = \\int_{x_\\textrm{min}}^x dt \\ :",
    "f(t ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 stands for the cumulative distribution function of @xmath66 .",
    "we then have : @xmath78 intuitively , the intervals from @xmath79 to @xmath69 , @xmath73 , and @xmath70 respectively correspond to the @xmath66 ranges into which @xmath71 , @xmath74 or @xmath72 of all hits fall .",
    "this is also illustrated in the histogram for @xmath80 in fig .",
    "moreover , we have included vertical lines into each plot to indicate the respective positions of @xmath69 , @xmath73 , and @xmath70 .    in our case",
    "the median is a particularly useful measure of location .",
    "first of all , it is resistant against outliers and hence an appropriate statistic for such skewed distributions as we observe them .",
    "but more importantly , the average absolute deviation from the median is minimal in comparison to any other reference point .",
    "the median is thus the best guess for the outcome of a measurement if one is interested in being as close as possible to the actual result , irrespective of the sign of the error . on the technical side the definition of",
    "the median fits nicely together with our method of assessing statistical dispersion .",
    "the @xmath81 confidence interval as introduced above is just constructed in such a way that equal numbers of hits lie in the intervals from @xmath69 to @xmath73 and from @xmath73 to @xmath70 , respectively . in this sense ,",
    "our confidence interval represents a symmetric error with respect to the median .    as a test of the robustness of our results",
    ", we checked the dependence of our distributions on the precise choice of the experimental error intervals .",
    "the results presented here proved insensitive to these variations .",
    "for definiteness , we therefore stick to the @xmath51 intervals .",
    "we also checked the effect of taking the random @xmath82 factors to be distributed uniformly on a linear instead of a logarithmic scale .",
    "again , the results proved to be robust .",
    "_ mass hierarchy _    an important open question which could help unravel the flavour structure of the neutrino sector is the mass hierarchy .",
    "since the sign of @xmath83 is not yet known , we can not differentiate with current experimental data between a normal hierarchy with one heavy and two light neutrino mass eigenstates and an inverted hierarchy , which has two heavy and one light neutrino mass eigenstate .",
    "measuring the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect of the earth could resolve this ambiguity .    with the procedure described above",
    ", all hits match the structure of the normal hierarchy and there are no examples with inverted hierarchy .",
    "it is however notable that imposing the structure of the neutrino mass matrix given by eq .   alone",
    "does not exclude the inverted mass hierarchy . only additionally imposing the measured bounds on the mixing angles",
    "rejects this possibility .",
    "_ mixing angles _    the mixing in the lepton sector is described by the matrix @xmath84 given in eq .  .",
    "of the three angles , two are only bounded from one side by experiment : for the largest mixing angle @xmath85 there exists a lower bound , whereas the smallest mixing angle @xmath4 is so far only bounded from above .",
    "recent results from t2k  @xcite , minos  @xcite and the preliminary result of double chooz  @xcite point to a value of @xmath4 just below the current experimental bound .",
    "the respective best fit points , assuming a normal hierarchy , are @xmath86 ( t2k ) , @xmath87 ( minos ) and @xmath88 ( double chooz ) .",
    "the 90@xmath89 and 68@xmath89 confidence regions respectively read @xmath90    with the procedure described above , we find sharp predictions for the smallest and the largest mixing angle within the current experimental bounds , @xmath91 the corresponding distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mixing ] .",
    "these results are quite remarkable : the atmospheric mixing angle points to maximal mixing , while the rather large value for @xmath4 is consistent with the recent t2k , minos and double chooz results .",
    "in our monte - carlo study we observe that the dominant contribution to the strong mixing in the lepton sector is primarily due to the neutrino mass matrix @xmath92 .",
    "the numerical results are not much affected by including the charged lepton mixing matrix @xmath42 .",
    "the pmns matrix is thus approximately given by the matrix @xmath43 which diagonalizes the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath92 .",
    "_ absolute mass scale _",
    "the absolute neutrino mass scale is a crucial ingredient for the study of neutrinoless double - beta decay and leptogenesis .",
    "although inaccessible in neutrino oscillation experiments , different experimental setups have succeeded in constraining this mass scale .",
    "cosmological observations of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background , of the density fluctuations in the galaxy distribution and of the lyman-@xmath93 forest yield a constraint for the sum of the light neutrino masses , weighted by the number of spin degrees of freedom per majorana neutrino , @xmath94 , @xcite @xmath95    the planck satellite is expected to be sensitive to values of @xmath96 as low as roughly @xmath97  ev  @xcite .",
    "a further constraint arises from measuring the @xmath98-spectrum in tritium decay experiments .",
    "the current bound  @xcite is @xmath99 by comparison , the katrin experiment , which will start taking data soon , aims at reaching a sensitivity of @xmath100  @xcite .",

    "dedicated experiments , such as gerda  @xcite with a design sensitivity of @xmath103  ev , are on the way .",
    "note that @xmath104 does not only depend on the absolute neutrino mass scale and the mixing angles , but also on the phases @xmath105 and @xmath106 in the pmns matrix .",

    "_ theoretical versus experimental input _",

    ", the distributions presented above really arise from the interplay between both of these ingredients .",
    "for example , the hierarchy structure alone does not favour a large solar mixing angle @xmath11 and the ratio @xmath126 tends to be too large ( cf .",
    "this discrepancy is eased by generating the random coefficients in eq .   via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "imposing the experimental constraints finally singles out the subset of parameter sets used for the distributions presented above . as another example , consider the smallest mixing angle @xmath4 and the lightest neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath110 . in these cases ,",
    "the hierarchy structure of the neutrino mass matrix automatically implies small values , similar to those shown in the distributions above .",
    "however , the exact distributions including the precise position of the peaks only arise after implementing the experimental constraints . a notable exception to",
    "this scheme is the majorana phase @xmath106 . here",
    "the peak at @xmath14 is a result of the hierarchy structure of the neutrino matrix @xmath92 alone , as demonstrated in appendix  [ app_alpha1 ] .",
    "in summary , we find that starting from a flavour symmetry which accounts for the measured quark and lepton mass hierarchies and large neutrino mixing , the present knowledge of neutrino parameters strongly constrains the yet unknown observables , in particular the smallest mixing angle @xmath4 , the smallest neutrino mass @xmath110 , and the majorana phase @xmath106 . this statement is based on a monte - carlo study : treating unspecified @xmath0 parameters of the considered froggatt - nielsen model as random variables , the observables of interest are sharply peaked around certain central values .",

    "an obvious example are extradimensional models which lead to the same type of light neutrino mass matrix ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , quark - lepton mass hierarchies and the presently known neutrino observables can not determine the remaining observables in a model - independent way .",
    "this is illustrated by the fact that our present knowledge about quark and lepton masses and mixings is still consistent with @xmath127 as well as with an inverted neutrino mass hierarchy ( cf .",
