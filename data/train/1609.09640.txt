    "a main motivation for the interest in clss and fbs is due to the macroscopic degeneracy they enforce .",
    "such macroscopic degeneracies are usually removed due to external perturbations , leading to new eigenstates , whose properties are sensitively depending on the type of perturbation added . in this work",
    "we show that spin - orbit coupling with cold atoms in optical lattices acts as a degeneracy - preserving perturbation .",
    "we also find that properly tuned interactions destroy the notion of a band structure , yet preserve the clss which simply detune their frequencies .",
    "a detuning of these interactions will finally destroy the clss .",
    "in addition to that , in this work we have demonstrated that the presence of the fb strongly affects not only the clss but also regular dss .",
    "it is expected that these dss will keep their properties even if a perturbation of the system will lend the fb a weak curvature .    as a development of the analysis , it may be interesting to analyze a fully two - dimensional version of the system .",
    "in particular , modes in the form of stable localized vortices have not been found in the present system , both with and without the soc terms .",
    "it is plausible that vortex modes may exist in the fully two - dimensional lattice .",
