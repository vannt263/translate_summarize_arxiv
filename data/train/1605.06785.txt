    "this drift @xmath18 is defined using a special case of the intrinsic approach to derivatives for dirichlet forms , see e.g. @xcite , applied to the form @xmath19 .",
    "we point out that @xmath18 does not have to be the trace of @xmath17 on @xmath7 .",
    "the expression @xmath20 plays the role of the tangential derivative of @xmath16 along @xmath7 .",
    "we prove that it can be defined as the measurable gradient on the fractal boundary @xmath7 of the restriction @xmath21 of @xmath16 to @xmath7 . in principle",
    "this is nothing else but a version of the gradient in the sense of kusuoka @xcite , kigami @xcite , strichartz @xcite and teplyaev @xcite .",
    "but only the more functional analytic description @xcite permits sufficient flexibility for applications to partial differential equations @xcite , magnetic operators @xcite or geometric analysis @xcite .",
    "there are ( locally harmonic ) coordinate functions @xmath22 on the snowflake @xmath7 , and for functions on @xmath23 locally representable as @xmath24 with bounded functions @xmath25 we locally have @xmath26 i.e. the measurable gradient admits a pointwise bounded expression . in this case",
    "the measurable gradient can also be expressed as a limit of difference quotients in the spirit of mosco @xcite , see section [ s : tangential ] .",
    "the span of such functions is a dense subspace of the domain of @xmath19 .",
    "abstract gradients can be defined for any dirichlet form , @xcite , and this is already sufficient to formulate and study partial differential equations with first order terms on some abstract level , @xcite .",
    "interpretations of these abstract gradients as limits of difference quotients , @xcite , or in terms of finite element approximations , @xcite , are possible also for energy forms on other sufficiently structured fractals , such as for instance resistance forms on p.c.f .",

    "in many cases one can find pointwise bounded coordinate representations similar to ( [ e : composition ] ) , what allows to consider non - linear equations such as in @xcite .",
    "the novelty of the present paper is that we prove that in our situation @xmath20 is a well defined @xmath27-function on @xmath7 , and so we can consider problem ( [ e1 ] ) for instance with a bounded measurable function @xmath18 on the fractal @xmath7 , which then plays the role of a ( bounded measurable ) tangential drift vector field .",
    "this is very special and only possible because @xmath7 is a curve .",
    "an interpretation of measurable gradients as measurable vector - valued functions will generally be more involved for other more complicated fractal sets",

    "the koch snowflake domain appears in @xcite .",
    "our current paper is primarily motivated by physics considerations , see @xcite and , in broader terms , @xcite , and by @xcite .",
    "an extensive discussion of potential applications and numerical implementations can be found in @xcite .",

    "* ( @xmath29 ) , page 682 ) , which correspond to the special case with @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we note that the koch curve is a lindstrm s nested fractal , see @xcite , and so the papers @xcite provide some heat semigroup estimates .",
    "see especially theorem 2.11 in @xcite , where ultracontractivity bounds for the brownian motion penetrating into the fractal are deduced from ultracontractivity bounds for the diffusion on the fractal .",
    "however , pointwise heat kernel estimates are not available in the existing literature , in particular because the reference measure on @xmath33  is not volume doubling , although @xcite contains some results towards obtaining such heat kernel estimates .",
    "our first main result is theorem [ t : strictsol ] , which claims that under standard conditions on @xmath34 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 ( such as ellipticity , form - boundedness , continuity and hlder continuity ) a suitable reformulation of ( [ e1 ] ) as an abstract cauchy problem in an @xmath27-space has a unique classical solution . as in @xcite one",
    "can then pass to a rigorous reformulation of ( [ e1 ] ) , see section [ s : co - normal ] , in particular ( [ e : interpret ] ) .",
    "a second , auxiliary main result is an extension theorem for lipschitz functions that complements known extension results,@xcite , and connects to coordinate methods , @xcite .",
    "the dirichlet form @xmath19 induces an intrinsic metric on @xmath7 , cf .",

    "moreover , one can find two coordinate functions @xmath40 which are contained in the core and separate the points of @xmath33 .",
    "we believe that the coordinate approach will permit new regularity results for first order terms on @xmath7 . for theorem [ thm : lip ]",
    "we provide two different proofs , which both proceed by triangulation methods and therefore are of potential interest for numerical implementations .",
    "we proceed as follows . in section [ enercurve ]",
    "we recall the definition of the kusuoka - kigami energy form @xmath19 and laplacian @xmath11 on the snowflake @xmath7 . in section [ s : tangential ]",
    "we define the tangential gradient operator @xmath41 as an operator on the natural @xmath27-space on @xmath7 .",
    "section [ s : cauchy ] contains a set of standard conditions under which ( [ e1 ] ) admits a suitable reformulation as an @xmath27-cauchy problem that has a unique classical solution .",
    "following @xcite we provide a concrete interpretation of this cauchy problem as a version of ( [ e1 ] ) in section [ s : co - normal ] , the main issue here is a suitable explanation of the co - normal derivative . the extension theorem is discussed in section [ s : extension ] and the two proofs are provided in subsections [ subsub : lip ] and [ subsub : lip2 ] , respectively .",

    "the notation @xmath61 in ( [ enu ] ) means that we sum over all @xmath62 that are @xmath55-neighbors of @xmath63 . due to the rescaling with prefactor @xmath64 the discrete energies",

    "the other four vertices of this hexagon lie on @xmath356 , and so we define @xmath431 at these vertices . now as we defined @xmath379 at the all vertices of the hexagon , we define @xmath379 at its center as the average at the vertices . since the hexagon is naturally triangulated into six equilateral triangles of side @xmath406 , we can interpolate @xmath379 linearly in each of these triangles .",
    "now we have defined @xmath379 in the closed set which is the union of the unit regular hexagon @xmath429 and the six adjacent closed hexagons with sides @xmath406 , we denote this union by @xmath432 .    _ step 3 _ : note that @xmath433 consists of 30 open components .",
    "these components come in two shapes : 18 components are @xmath434 in size in comparison to the components considered in step 2 ; the other 12 component are of the same scale , but have only one fractal side , rather than two fractal sides . in any case",

    "we can then consider its euclidean - lipschitz extension to a sectorial part of @xmath1 similarly as constructed in the first proof of theorem  [ thm : lip ] .",

    "the construction is essentially elementary because the weak self - similarity allows to define coordinates in a finitely many points , and then define extensions using translations and scaling .",
