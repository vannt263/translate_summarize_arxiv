    "where the aspect ratio changes from the @xmath60 direction to the @xmath55 direction the 2d gaussian amplitude increases dramatically as does the amplitude of the away - side @xmath56 .",

    "having pairs of particles around 1  gev / c from a thermal source should be very rare .    besides the study of jet - like structure we have also characterized the @xmath57 component , ( @xmath62/\\sqrt{\\rho_{ref}}$ ] ) , that we extract from fits to 2d angular correlations .",

    "we measure two - particle correlations as a function of the @xmath3 of one of the particles . extracting the @xmath59 component",
    "we expect it should have a leading @xmath3 dependence which we remove . defining @xmath71 so that @xmath72 is unit normalized we note that all centralities for au - au at @xmath0  gev fall on a single curve , defined as @xmath73 , which happens to be a lvy distribution .",
