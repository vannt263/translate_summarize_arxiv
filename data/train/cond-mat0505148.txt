    "lanthanide based heavy fermion ( hf ) metals constitute a major , long studied class of correlated electron materials  @xcite .",
    "their behaviour is quite distinct from conventional clean metals , the basic physics being driven by strong spin - flip scattering from essentially localised @xmath3-levels , generating the large effective mass and attendant low - energy scale indicative of strong interactions .",
    "the low - temperature ( @xmath4 ) state is a lattice - coherent fermi liquid with well defined quasiparticles and coherently screened @xmath3-spins , crossing over with increasing @xmath4 to essentially incoherent screening via independent kondo scattering , before attaining characteristic clean metallic behaviour .",
    "physical properties of hf are in consequence typically ` anomalous ' : e.g.  the resistivity @xmath5 shows a strong non - monotonic @xmath4-dependence , while optics often exhibit rich structure from the microwave to the near infrared , and pronounced evolution on low temperature scales  @xcite .",
    "theoretical treatments of hf centre on the periodic anderson model ( pam ) , in which a non - interacting conduction band hybridizes locally with a correlated @xmath3-level in each unit cell of the lattice ; or on its strong coupling limit , the kondo lattice model .",
    "the absence of exact results ( save for some in one dimension , see e.g.  @xcite ) has long spurred the search for suitable approximation schemes .",
    "one such framework , which has had a major impact in recent years , is provided by dynamical mean field theory ( dmft , for reviews see  @xcite ) . formally exact in the large - dimensional limit",
    ", the self - energy within dmft becomes momentum independent and hence spatially local , but still retains full temporal dynamics ; such that all lattice models map onto an effective single - impurity model with a self - consistently determined host  @xcite .",
    "that raises an immediate question , easier asked than answered : to what extent are the properties of real hf materials captured within a dmft approach to the pam ? to answer this clearly requires direct quantitative comparsion of theory to experiment . and",
    "a prerequisite to that in turn is a method to solve the pam  which dmft does not _",
    "per se _ provide .",
    "the latter has of course been studied extensively using a wide variety of techniques .",
    "full scale numerical methods include the numerical renormalization group ( nrg )  @xcite , quantum monte carlo  @xcite and exact diagonalization  @xcite , while theoretical approaches encompass finite - order perturbation theory in the interaction @xmath6  @xcite , iterated perturbation theory  @xcite , the lattice non - crossing approximation  @xcite and the average @xmath7-matrix approximation  @xcite , large-@xmath8 mean - field theory / slave bosons  @xcite , the gutzwiller variational approach  @xcite and the recently developed local moment approach  @xcite .",
    "all of these methods naturally have their own virtues .",
    "but most possess significant , well known limitations  @xcite , be it the general inability of perturbative approaches ( and in practice quantum monto carlo ) to handle strong interactions ; failure to recover fermi liquid behaviour at low - energies as arises in nca - based approaches , restriction to the lowest - energy fermi liquid behaviour as in large-@xmath8/slave boson mean - field theories , finite - size effects limiting exact diagonalization , and so on .",
    "to enable viable comparison to experiment requires an approach that can adequately handle all experimentally relevant energy and/or temperature scales in the strongly correlated hf regime of primary interest ; and indeed ideally also across the full spectrum of interaction strengths , such that intermediate valence and related behaviour can likewise be treated .",
    "one such is employed here , the local moment approach ( lma )  @xcite . via study of the generic asymmetric pam ,",
    "our essential aims are ( i ) to provide a many - body description of dynamical and transport properties of paramagnetic hf , notably single - particle dynamics , d.c .",
    "transport and optical conductivities ; as considered here .",
    "( ii ) to make direct quantitative comparison with experiment . that is taken up in the following paper where comparison to transport / optical properties of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is made .",
    "some remarks on the lma are apposite at this point since the paper will focus mainly on results obtained using the approach , with minimal technical details .",
    "intrinsically non - perturbative and as such capable of handling strong interactions , the lma  @xcite introduces the physically intuitive notion of local moments  @xcite from the outset .",
    "this leads directly to a ` two - self - energy ' description in which , post mean - field level , the key correlated spin - flip dynamics is readily captured ; corresponding in physical terms to dynamical tunneling between initially degenerate local moment configurations , which lifts the erstwhile spin degeneracy and restores the local singlet symmetry characteristic of a fermi liquid state . as with all techniques for lattice models within dmft , the lma originated in study of the single - impurity anderson model ( aim )  @xcite , where results for dynamics are known to give good agreement with nrg calculations  @xcite , and for static magnetic properties with known exact results  @xcite",
    "the approach has recently been developed to encompass the anderson lattice ( pam ) ; initially for the particle - hole symmetric limit  @xcite appropriate to the kondo insulating sub - class of heavy electron materials , where for all interaction strengths the system is an ` insulating fermi liquid ' that evolves continuously from its simple non - interacting limit of a hybridization - gap insulator  @xcite . from this",
    "a rich description of transport and optical properties of kondo insulators arises  @xcite , particularly in strong coupling where the system is characterized by an exponentially small indirect gap scale @xmath13 , such that dynamics / transport exhibit scaling as functions of @xmath14 . exploiting that scaling enables direct comparison to experiment with minimal use of ` bare ' material / model parameters ; and in particular for three classic kondo insulators @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , leads to what we regard as excellent agreement between theory and experiment on essentially all relevant energy and temperature scales  @xcite .",
    "the particle - hole symmetric pam is of course special , confined as it is to the case of kondo insulators .",
    "most recently the lma has been non - trivially extended to handle the generic asymmetric pam  @xcite and hence hf metals ( with the insulating symmetric limit recovered simply as a particular case ) .",
    "single - particle dynamics at @xmath18 were considered in  @xcite , with a natural emphasis on the strongly correlated kondo lattice regime of localised @xmath3-electrons but general conduction ( ` @xmath19 ' ) band filling @xmath20 .",
    "the problem was found to be characterized by a _",
    "single _ low - energy coherence scale @xmath1  the precise counterpart of the insulating indirect gap scale @xmath21 , and likewise exponentially small in strong coupling  in terms of which dynamics exhibit one - parameter universal scaling as a function of @xmath22 , independently of either the interaction strength or local @xmath23 hybridization . with increasing @xmath24 dynamics cross over from the low - energy quasiparticle behaviour required by and symptomatic of the coherent fermi liquid state , to essentially incoherent single - impurity kondo scaling physics at high-@xmath24",
    " but still in the @xmath24-scaling regime and as such incompatible  @xcite with a two - scale ` exhaustion ' scenario  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the work of  @xcite to finite temperature , thereby enabling access to d.c .",
    "transport and optics .",
    "our primary focus is again the strongly correlated hf regime and attendant issues of scaling / universality ( that play a key role in comparing to experiment ) , the paper being organised as follows . the model and a bare bones description of background theory is introduced in section 2 , together with preliminary consideration of transport / optics .",
    "results for the thermal evolution of single - particle dynamics and scattering rates , and the connection between the two , are given in section 3 .",
    "the d.c .",
    "resistivity is considered in section 4 , with particular emphasis in this context on the crossover from the low-@xmath25 coherent fermi liquid to the high-@xmath26 incoherent regime , and explicit connection to single - impurity scaling behaviour .",
    "optical conductivities on all relevant @xmath27- and @xmath4-scales are investigated in section 5 ; and the paper concludes with a brief summary .",
    "the hamiltonian for the pam is given by @xmath28 : = _ c_i , c^_i c^_i & -&t_(i , j),c^_i c^_i + _",
    "i,(_f+ f^_i - f^_i- ) f^_if^_i + & + & v_i , ( f^_i c^_i + ) [ 2.1 ] the first two terms represent the uncorrelated conduction ( @xmath19 ) band , + @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) ; with @xmath19-orbital site energies @xmath31 and nearest - neighbour hopping matrix element @xmath32 , rescaled as @xmath33 in the large dimensional limit where the coordination number @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the third term describes the correlated @xmath3-levels , @xmath35 , with site energies @xmath36 and on  site coulomb repulsion @xmath6 ; while the final term @xmath37 hybridizes the @xmath19- and @xmath3-levels locally via the matrix element @xmath38 , rendering the otherwise localised @xmath3-electrons itinerant .",
    "the model is thus characterized by four independent dimensionless parameters , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 sets the scale for the width of the free conduction band and is taken as the basic unit of energy , @xmath42 ) . an equivalent and somewhat more convenient set of ` bare'/material parameters ( with @xmath43 ) is @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "this parameter space is large , and as such encompasses a wide range of physical behaviour for the paramagnetic phases we consider .",
    "the system is of course generically metallic , with non - integral @xmath3-level and @xmath19-band occupancies ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively ) .",
    "that in turn extends from the trivial case of weakly correlated , perturbative behaviour , through intermediate valence to the strongly correlated heavy fermion ( hf ) regime .",
    "it is naturally the latter , characterized by a low - energy coherence scale @xmath49 , that is of primary interest .",
    "the hf ( or kondo lattice ) regime corresponds to essentially localised @xmath3-electrons , @xmath50 , but with arbitrary conduction band filling @xmath51 , the latter being controlled by @xmath52 ( which determines the centre of gravity of the free ( @xmath53 ) conduction band relative to the fermi level ) .",
    "it arises when @xmath54 , for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( whence @xmath57 ) ; where @xmath58 , with @xmath59 the free conduction electron density of states as specified below and @xmath60 the fermi level .",
    "the heavy fermion regime forms our main focus here ; intermediate valence behaviour will be discussed in an experimental context in the following paper .",
    "the exception to the above behaviour arises when @xmath61 . here",
    "the system is generically a kondo insulator ( see _ eg  @xcite ) , with an indirect gap in both its @xmath18 single - particle spectrum _ and _ optical conductivity  @xcite ; the canonical example being the particle - hole symmetric pam with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 for all @xmath6 . just like its metallic counterpart arising for @xmath65 ,",
    "the kondo insulator is however a fermi liquid , evolving continuously with increasing interaction strength from its non - interacting limit ( in this case a ` hybridization gap insulator '  @xcite ) . as such , the kondo insulating state",
    "is obtained simply as a particular limit of the underlying theory . _",
    "a knowledge of local single - particle dynamics and their thermal evolution is well known to be sufficient within dmft  @xcite to determine transport properties ( see section 2.2 below ) .",
    "our initial focus is thus on the local retarded green functions @xmath66 and likewise @xmath67 for the @xmath19-levels , with corresponding spectra @xmath68 ( and @xmath69 or @xmath3 ) .",
    "some brief comments on the free conduction band are first required ( @xmath53 in equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) , where the @xmath19- and @xmath3-subsystems decouple ) ; specified by the local propagator @xmath70 with corresponding density of states ( dos ) @xmath59 .",
    "this is given by g_0^c ( ) & = & ( ^+-_c ) [ 2.2a ] + & = & [ 2.2b ] with @xmath71 , where for arbitrary complex @xmath72 h(z ) = ^+_- d [ 2.3 ] denotes the hilbert transform with respect to @xmath73 ; such that from equation ( [ 2.2a ] ) , @xmath74 corresponds simply to a rigid shift of @xmath75 by @xmath52 .",

    "the hcl will in fact be the primary case , because the bloch states characteristic of it ultimately underlie the lattice coherence inherent to low - temperature metallic hf behaviour .",
    "the major simplifying feature of dmft is that the self - energy becomes momentum - independent and hence site - diagonal  @xcite ; and since we are interested in the homogeneous paramagnetic phase , the local green functions @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) are also site - independent .",

    "that statement hides however the truly difficult part of the problem : obtaining the self - energy @xmath87 .",

    "the gap ( which is well developed in strong coupling  @xcite ) moves above the fermi level ; and a sharp lattice - kondo resonance symptomatic of the hf metal , straddling the fermi level and of width @xmath180 , takes its place in the @xmath3-spectra .",

    "two further points regarding figure [ fig3 ] should be noted .",
    "first , the thermal evolution of the @xmath3- and @xmath19-spectra differ somewhat in terms of the persistence of a pseudogap  the @xmath3-spectrum shows no sign of the gap by @xmath196 , while a weak pseudogap structure persists in the @xmath19-spectrum up to @xmath197 ; this reflects the rapid spread of spectral weight caused by the meltdown of the sharp resonance in the @xmath3-spectra , of which there is no counterpart in the @xmath19-spectra .",
    "second , the inset to figure [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath3-spectra on an enlarged frequency scale out to @xmath198 , from which it is seen that the high frequency behaviour of the finite-@xmath26 scaling spectra coincide with that for @xmath18 .",
    "this is physically natural , since one expects the dominant influence of temperature to be confined to frequencies @xmath199 .",
    "the corollary of course is that non - universal frequencies are affected only on non - universal , and thus in general physically irrelevant , temperature scales ( as shown in figure 5 of  @xcite for the p - h symmetric case ) .",
    "we consider now the scattering rates @xmath200 that underlie the evolution of the conductivity , and are given explicitly in terms of the @xmath3-electron self - energy by equation ( [ 2.11 ] ) . since the system is a fermi liquid with @xmath201 , at @xmath18 there is of course no scattering at the fermi level , @xmath202 .",
    "the low frequency behaviour of the @xmath18 scattering rate can be understood qualitatively by using the low-@xmath27 expansion of @xmath203 ( equation ( [ 2.12 ] ) ) and simply neglecting the imaginary part @xmath204 ; leading to ^-1(;t=0 ) ( - _ f^ * ) [ 3.1 ] with @xmath205 the renormalized level .",
    "restoring the small but strictly non - vanishing @xmath206 naturally implies a narrow resonance centred on @xmath207 instead of a pure @xmath208-function . at finite temperature",
    ", we likewise expect the scattering rate to increase from zero in the neighbourhood of the fermi level , reflecting the finite-@xmath4 contribution to @xmath209 ; and that this will simultaneously lead to further , thermal broadening of the resonance at @xmath150 .",
    "the above picture is corroborated by lma results as shown in figure [ fig4 ] , displaying the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath200 ( in units of @xmath42 ) arising in strong coupling for @xmath187 and @xmath172 , for a range of temperatures @xmath210 between @xmath211 and @xmath212 .    in this case",

    "resistivities that are typical of heavy fermion materials  @xcite ) .",
    "neither is this behaviour confined to a narrow @xmath26 regime since even for @xmath216 the scattering rates decay very slowly with @xmath26 ; the fermi level scattering rate for example is readily shown to decay as @xmath217 .",

    "as shown in section 3.1 , the large @xmath24 and/or @xmath26 dependence of the reduced scattering rate @xmath220 coincides with the @xmath3-spectral function @xmath221 ( equation ( [ 3.3 ] ) ) ; and in section 3 ( see also  @xcite ) the latter were shown to have common spectral tails , independently of @xmath147 .",

    "[ h ]    the obvious final question here concerns the high-@xmath26 form of @xmath264 for the pam . to that end",
    "we consider the anderson single - impurity model ( aim ) , with @xmath267 denoting as usual the change of resistivity due to addition of the impurity to the non - interacting host , and @xmath268 .",

    "it is seen that the high-@xmath26 scaling behaviour of @xmath264 for the pam is precisely that of the aim ; in particular the leading @xmath216 behaviour of the lma @xmath264 is readily shown analytically to be given by @xmath276 , which is exact in the kondo limit of the impurity model  @xcite .",
    "this reflects again the crossover in the strong coupling pam from low - temperature lattice coherent behaviour to incoherent effective single - impurity scaling physics , here in the context of d.c .  transport . as for its counterpart in the case of single - particle dynamics  @xcite",
    ", we point out ( a ) that since this connection is established from scaling considerations it is entirely independent of how the scales @xmath1 and @xmath277 for the two distinct models ( pam and aim ) depend on the underlying bare / material parameters of the respective problems ; and ( b ) the fact that it arises in the @xmath278 scaling regime precludes a two - scale description of the crossover from lattice - coherent to incoherent effective single - impurity physics .",
    "our focus above has naturally been on the strong coupling , kondo lattice regime .",
    "we now look briefly at d.c .",
    "transport on non - universal scales .",
    "what one expects here is that when the temperature is a not insignificant fraction of the hybridization @xmath170 or bandwidth scale @xmath279 , kondo screening will be washed out , and hence @xmath5 should cross over from the logarithmically decreasing single - impurity form at @xmath280 ( figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] ) to conventional metallic behaviour @xmath281 at non - universal temperatures ; and thus as such must go through a minimum .",
    "that this indeed happens can be seen in the inset to figure [ fig8 ] where we show @xmath282 _ vs _",
    "@xmath25 for @xmath187 , @xmath283 and @xmath284 ( solid line ) and @xmath285 ( point - dash ) .",
    "for the lower @xmath6 example , a minimum is seen at @xmath286 , which corresponds in ` absolute ' units ( @xmath41 ) to a temperature @xmath287  an appreciable fraction of the hybridization @xmath288 .",
    "the corresponding minimum does of course exist for the higher @xmath6 , but is pushed beyond @xmath289 ( and to concomitantly lower vales of @xmath5 ) ; and @xmath5 in this case lies on the universal scaling curve throughout the @xmath26-range shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "a final point is worth noting here . for @xmath290 , the @xmath5 _ vs _",
    "@xmath25 for the two @xmath6 s shown in figure [ fig8 ] ( inset ) are in essence coincident ; each lies on the universal scaling curve .",
    "what distinguishes different interaction strengths is of course the location of the minimum , occurring as it does on non - universal temperature scales .",
    "no real hf material is however in the universal scaling regime ` for ever '  with increasing @xmath4 the scaling regime will be exited sooner or later .",
    "and the temperature for which the experimental @xmath5 is a minimum ( once phonon contributions have been subtracted out ) can provide valuable information on the interaction strength , as we shall see in action in the following paper .",
    "we have considered almost exclusively the hypercubic lattice , for the obvious reason that its one - particle bloch states ultimately underlie the low - temperature lattice coherence of the interacting problem . for the bethe lattice , the strong coupling scaling resistivity @xmath291 ( with @xmath292 from equation ( [ 2.18 ] ) ) is shown _ vs _ @xmath26 in inset ( b ) to figure [ fig6 ] , for @xmath293 .",
    "in contrast to its counterpart for the hcl shown in the main figure , the @xmath222 resistivity is non - vanishing ( given by equation ( [ 2.19 ] ) ) , reflecting the absence of coherent bloch states for the bl .",
    "further , the _ high_-@xmath26 asymptote of the bl @xmath5 in the scaling regime is likewise non - zero ; being given by the @xmath18 value of the free ( @xmath53 ) conduction band resistivity , namely @xmath294 ^ 2 = \\pi^2/[4(1-\\epsilon_c^2)]$ ] as marked by a cross in figure [ fig6 ] inset ( and arising for the same physical reasons discussed for kondo insulators in  @xcite ) .",
    "the qualitative contrast between @xmath5 for the canonically bloch decomposable hcl , and that for the bl , illustrates why the latter  more specifically the associated ` joint density of states ' type formula equation ( [ 2.18 ] ) for @xmath295 that is not uncommonly employed in the literature  gives a poor caricature of d.c .",
    "transport for hf metals in which the lattice coherence is of central importance .",
    "we turn now to the optical conductivity @xmath296 ( with @xmath126 given by equation ( [ 2.10 ] ) ) . in the strong coupling kondo lattice regime",
    "@xmath126 is of course independent of @xmath6 and @xmath189 , and a universal function of @xmath22 and @xmath25 for fixed @xmath147 and @xmath45 .",
    "lma results for @xmath126 are shown in figure [ fig9 ] , for @xmath179 and @xmath224 .",
    "the right panel shows the thermal evolution of the optical conductivity ( on a linear @xmath24-scale ) for temperatures @xmath297 and @xmath223 ; while the left panel ( on a log - log scale ) shows the behaviour for a lower range of temperatures up to @xmath298 .",
    "the latter in particular illustrates the thermal evolution of the optical drude peak , which at @xmath299 consists of an @xmath300 @xmath208-function given by equations ( 2.14 ) ( with net weight @xmath180 in strong coupling ) . on increasing @xmath26 from @xmath211",

    "similar behaviour is naturally found on varying @xmath147 and/or @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows in particular the influence of @xmath147 ( varying conduction band filling ) on the optical pseudogap for a fixed temperature @xmath306 , from which it is seen that the pseudogap becomes shallower with increasing @xmath147 .",
    "the above behaviour should be compared to the p - h symmetric kondo insulator ( ki ) @xmath307 considered in  @xcite . in that case",
    "the @xmath18 optical conductivity is characterized by an indirect gap @xmath308 , and there is of course no @xmath18 drude peak .",
    "instead a drude - like peak in the optical conductivity actually builds up on initially increasing @xmath26 from zero ( see figure 15 of  @xcite ) , before being thermally broadened and subsumed into the optical pseudogap . for @xmath309 or so",
    "the low - frequency optics of the ki are thus very different from those of the hf metal , as expected .",
    "but for @xmath310 the optical behaviour of the two is qualitatively similar as shown by comparison of figure [ fig9 ] ( right panel ) and its counterpart for the ki , figure 14 of  @xcite .",
    "this too is physically natural , since the infilling of the indirect optical gap on temperature scales @xmath192 means that the ki behaves to all intents and purposes as a hf metal ; as seen also in figures [ fig7 ] or [ fig8 ] for the static transport .",
    "a second point should be emphasised here , obvious though it is from the preceding discussion : whether for hf metals or kondo insulators , it is the low - energy scale @xmath159 that sets the intrinsic scale for both the @xmath27-dependence of the low - energy optical conductivity and its thermal evolution . and in strong coupling that scale is wholly distinct from the optical _ direct _ gap , @xmath311 .",
    "the latter arises at its simplest in the commonly employed renormalized band picture ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , as the minimum direct gap for which optical transitions are allowed . in this effective single - particle description the imaginary part of the @xmath3-electron self - energy  and hence all scattering ",
    "is neglected entirely , and the corresponding real part @xmath312 is replaced by its leading low-@xmath27 behaviour equation ( [ 2.12 ] ) ( as also inherent to a slave boson mean - field approximation  @xcite ) .",
    "the two branches of the renormalized bandstructure , denoted by @xmath313 with @xmath314 , then follow from the zeros of @xmath315^{-1 } = [ \\gamma(\\om)-\\epsilon_{\\mathbf k}]$ ] ( see equation ( [ 2.7 ] ) ) with the approximate @xmath316 @xmath317^{-1}$ ] from equation ( [ 2.5b ] ) ; and the resultant @xmath266-dependent direct gap @xmath318 $ ] is given by @xmath319^{1/2}$ ] with @xmath320 the usual renormalized level .",
    "the minimum direct gap , @xmath311 , occurs for @xmath321 ( @xmath322 in strong coupling ) and is thus _",
    "[ 5.1 ] the corresponding result for the optical conductivity @xmath126 is readily determined from equation ( [ 2.10 ] ) . denoted by @xmath323",

    "two points should be noted here .",
    "first that the low - energy scale @xmath159 intrinsic to hfs or kis is qualitatively distinct from the direct gap @xmath311 .",
    "in fact since @xmath328 it follows that in strong coupling where the quasiparticle weight @xmath146 and hence @xmath1 becomes exponentially small , optics on the direct gap scale do not even lie in the @xmath329 scaling regime ; although neither do they occur on truly non - universal scales ( because @xmath330 ) and in that sense belong to the ` low - frequency ' optical spectrum .",
    "second , we emphasise the inherent naivet of interpreting optics in terms of renormalized single - particle interband transitions : it is scattering due to electron interactions that generates _ all _ the optical density below the direct gap scale . failure to include such , as in a renormalized band picture  and regardless of how sophisticated the underlying band structure employed in practice  inevitably leads to a qualitatively inadequate description of optics ( as illustrated explicitly in figure [ fig11 ] below ) .",
    "neither is this situation ameliorated in materials application by the introduction of _ ad hoc _ @xmath27-dependent broadening factors , for that simply avoids the basic underlying physics .",
    "lma results for optics on all frequency scales are given in figure [ fig11 ] , for @xmath190 ; where @xmath126 is shown _ vs _",
    "@xmath22 on a log scale spanning five orders of magnitude , for the same range of temperatures @xmath25 employed in figure [ fig9 ] ( right panel ) . to encompass all @xmath27 including non - universal energies , the bare parameters @xmath6 and @xmath189 must of course be specified , @xmath331 and @xmath332 here being chosen for illustration ;",
    "although note that the optical conductivity as a function of @xmath22 remains ` universal ' ( independent of @xmath6 or @xmath189 ) up to large but finite values of @xmath24 determined by the particular @xmath6 and @xmath189 chosen , in this example @xmath333 ( a directly analogous situation for the resistivity @xmath5 is shown in the inset to figure [ fig8 ] ) .",

    "this enables the notional direct gap to be determined , @xmath338 here  well separated from the low - energy coherence scale @xmath1 in strong coupling  and indeed seen to occur for @xmath339 .",
    "the essential points from figure [ fig11 ] are clear .",
    "as expected and well known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , significant optical absorption occurs in the vicinity of the direct gap ; strongly broadened to low - energies due to electron interactions as above , and all but ` dead ' on non - universal energy scales ( e.g.  the hybridization @xmath340 for the chosen bare parameters ) .",
    "regarding the thermal evolution of the optical conductivity note also that temperatures on the order of a few multiples of the coherence scale @xmath1  which control the thermal evolution of the low - energy optics  have essentially no effect on frequencies of the order of the direct gap , reflecting the clean separation between @xmath1 and @xmath311 characteristic of strong coupling . as a corollary",
    "the direct gap should be thermally eroded only for @xmath341 ; as indeed seen in figure [ fig12 ] where ( for the same parameters as figure [ fig11 ] ) the thermal evolution of @xmath126 is shown for temperatures up to @xmath342 .",
    "significant thermal erosion sets in by about @xmath343 or so , and is well developed by the highest temperature shown .",
    "the clear scale separation between @xmath1 and @xmath311 will not however be captured properly if one is restricted to relatively low interactions and high temperatures as e.g.  in quantum monte carlo  @xcite , or from theories in which the quasiparticle weight @xmath146 is algebraically rather than exponentially small in the interaction strength , such as iterated perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "we have considered here the periodic anderson lattice , the canonical model for understanding heavy fermion metals , kondo insulators , intermediate valence and related materials .",
    "optical conductivities , d.c .",
    "transport and single - particle dynamics of the paramagnetic phase have been investigated , using the local moment approach within a dmft framework . for obvious physical reasons",
    "our main focus has been the strongly correlated kondo lattice regime , where we find the problem to be characterised by a single , exponentially small coherence scale @xmath1 ; in terms of which the frequency and temperature dependence of physical properties scale  being universally dependent on @xmath344 and/or @xmath25 regardless of the interaction or hybridization strengths .",
    "all relevant energy / temperature scales are handled by the theory , from the low - energy coherent fermi liquid domain out to large ( and in the strict scaling limit arbitrarily large ) multiples of @xmath1 where incoherent many - body scattering dominates the physics ; followed by the crossover out of the scaling regime to non - universal , high energy / temperature scales dictated by ` bare ' model / material parameters . and",
    "while our emphasis has been on strong correlations we add that all interaction strengths from weak to strong coupling are encompassed by the lma  @xcite , such that intermediate valence behaviour in particular can also be addressed .",
    "the first question posed in the introduction nonetheless remains : to what extent does the model , and our theory for it , capture experiment ?",
    "we turn to that in the following paper where direct comparison of theory and experiment is made for three heavy fermion materials and a classic intermediate valence compound .",
    "we are grateful to the epsrc for supporting this research ."
