    "this is a continuation of a previous article @xcite where the exact analytical three - dimensional wave function for a sharply cut - off coulomb potential has been derived together with the corresponding scattering amplitude ( the on - shell t - matrix ) . in the screening limit that scattering amplitude converges to a sum of two terms .",
    "one is the expected pure coulomb scattering amplitude multiplied with the standard renormalisation factor @xmath0 ; the other one is new and includes angular dependent phases @xmath1 , which oscillate without limit for infinite screening radius r. as has been conjectured in @xcite that second term would disappear after integration over some angular intervals in the sense of a distribution .",

    "( see @xcite , where the difficulties are spoken out leading in fact to incomplete results ) .",
