    "galaxy surveys are now becoming sufficiently extensive that eyeball verification of the entire automated detection and classification algorithms are impractical .",
    "for example , the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey input catalogue ( colless et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) contains over 300,000 galaxies for which redshifts have been targeted for 245,591 objects ( 229,118 galaxies , 16,348 stars and 125 qsos ) and high quality redshifts have been obtained for 221,414 galaxies .",
    "numerous publications , based on this dataset , have been used to constrain cosmological parameters ( e.g. , peacock et al .",
    "2001 ; efstathiou et al . 2002 ; verde et al .",
    "2002 and elgaroy et al . 2002 ) and measure the local galaxy luminosity function(s ) ( see folkes et al . 1999 ; cole et al . 2001",

    "2003 ) , the bivariate brightness distribution ( cross et al . 2001 ; cross & driver 2002 ) , star - formation histories ( baldry et al . 2002 ; lewis et al . 2002 ) and",
    "galaxy clustering ( norberg et al . 2001 ; norberg et al .",
    "2002a ) for example .",
    "the credibility of these papers relies , to some extent , upon the underlying accuracy and uniformity of the photometric input catalogue and its completeness ( see for example colless et al .",

    "2002b , cross et al .",

    "similarly the sloan digital sky survey which will eventually provide photometric information for over 1 billion objects ( york et al . 2000 ) will also be publicly released in stages ( e.g. stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) and the value to the community will depend upon the accuracy of the automated photometric , astrometric and object classification algorithms ( see for example yasuda et al . 2001 ; blanton et al . 2003 ) . here",
    "we aim to provide an independent estimate of the photometric and classification credibility of these public datasets , through the comparison with a third , manually verified dataset , namely the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ; liske et al .",
    "2003 ; lemon 2003 ) .",
    "the mgc is particularly suitable as it covers a sufficiently large area ( @xmath24 deg@xmath25 ) to ensure statistically significant overlap in terms of object numbers , yet is sufficiently small for all objects ( @xmath26 mag ) to have been manually inspected ( for all non - stellar objects ) and corrected , providing a robust and reliable survey .",
    "the mgc also probes to a substantially deeper isophote ( @xmath27 mag arcsec@xmath1 , liske et al .",
    "2003 ) than either the original apm plate scans ( upon which the 2dfgrs input catalogue is based ) or the sdss drift scans ( both with @xmath28 mag arcsec@xmath1 , maddox et al . 1990a , york et al .",
    "the resulting higher signal - to - noise allows more reliable photometric measurement , object classification and ( de)-blending fixes .",
    "the deeper isophote also allows a fully independent assessment of the completeness with regard to low surface brightness galaxies ( see impey & bothun 1997 ) . likewise the higher resolution and better",
    "mean seeing allows an assessment of the completeness for high surface brightness galaxies ( see for example drinkwater et al .",
    "these latter concerns are aired in detail in sprayberry et al .",
    "( 1997 ; see also oneil & bothun 2000 ) who , following on from disney ( 1976 ) , argue for incompleteness levels of as much as @xmath29 per cent in nearby galaxy catalogues such as the apm .",
    "if this is indeed correct then a deeper survey such as the millennium galaxy catalogue should uncover a significant number of galaxies either missed or with fluxes severely underestimated by the shallower surveys .    in this paper",
    "we describe the three independent imaging surveys ( mgc , 2dfgrs and sdss - edr ) and the catalogue matching process in section 2 & 3 .",
    "we quantify the photometric accuracy as a function of magnitude and surface brightness in section 4 , including recent updates to the 2dfgrs including supercosmos data and the recently released sdss first data release , and we quantify the reliability of the star - galaxy separation in section 5 . finally we explore the crucial question of completeness across the apparent magnitude apparent surface brightness plane ( @xmath30 ) in section 6 .",
    "we summarise our findings in section 7 .",

    "we note that the stellaricity distribution is extremely bimodal indicating reliable star - galaxy separation , ( see fig 9 of mgc1 ) even so all objects with stellaricity @xmath57 were visually inspected , classified and where necessary repaired manually for erroneous deblending , erroneous background estimation or contamination from nearby objects .",
    "a flag was assigned for each galaxy indicating whether its photometry was considered `` good '' , `` compromised '' or `` corrupted '' .",
    "bright stars , diffraction spikes , bad columns , hot pixels , satellite trails , bad charge transfer regions and ccd edges were masked .",
    "objects within a 50 pixel threshold of a masked pixel were removed from the catalogue to produce a final pristine fully eyeballed catalogue of 9795 galaxies ( 9657 `` good '' , 137 `` compromised '' and 0 `` corrupted '' ) within a reduced survey area of 30.90 deg@xmath25 over the magnitude range @xmath58 mag .",
    "half - light radii were measured for all galaxies within mgc - bright and are equal to the semi - major axis of the ellipse that contains half of the flux of the galaxy .",

    "they find that @xmath156 per cent of missing objects are blends , @xmath157 per cent were unresolved galaxies , @xmath158 per cent are normal galaxies and @xmath159 per cent are lsbgs .",
    "pimbblet et al . also find the median merger distance for blends , which varies from @xmath160 in abell 1084 to @xmath161 in abell 22 .",
    "the larcs group also determined why galaxies have been missed in the 2dfgrs .",
    "missing blended , unresolved objects , and lsbgs are easily understood , but it is difficult to comprehend why those galaxies classified as normal are missing .",
    "pimbblet et al . found that these objects had been classified as `` stellar '' , `` blended '' or `` noise '' on apm r - band plates which were used jointly with the @xmath64 plates to classify objects .",
    "the original apm catalogues are complete for all galaxies apart from some lsbgs , secondary galaxies and poorly resolved galaxies ( about @xmath162 per cent of all galaxies , @xmath123 mag ) but the 2dfgrs target catalogue is less complete , missing @xmath15 per cent of @xmath123 mag galaxies .",
    "finally pimbblet et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that the proportion of blends and unresolved galaxies missing in the 2dfgrs is constant with magnitude , whereas normal and low - surface brightness galaxies are missed predominantly at @xmath163 mag . a modest increase in incompleteness is seen for fainter galaxies , but the uncertainties are such that the results are consistent with constant incompleteness .",
    "we have also checked the incompleteness of the sdss - edr . out of 9795 mgc galaxies ( @xmath164 ) mag ,",
    "the overall incompleteness is @xmath21 per cent .",
    "[ fig : inc_s ] shows the photometric incompleteness of the sdss - edr as a function of @xmath107 .",
    "the incompleteness is never greater than @xmath165 per cent at any magnitude .",

    "the incompleteness is @xmath167 per cent for @xmath168 mag arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "it rises when @xmath169 mag arcsec@xmath1 due to the low signal to noise of these galaxies in the sdss .",
    "while only @xmath170 per cent of lsbgs @xmath141 mag arcsec@xmath1 are actually missing , this represents @xmath171 per cent of all missing sdss galaxies .",
    "[ fig : comp_bbd_s ] shows the distribution of missing galaxies ( triangles ) as a function of @xmath107 and @xmath166 .",
    "the squares show missing galaxies , where the mgc galaxy is the secondary component of an sdss galaxy ( @xmath172 per cent of cases ) .",
    "it is important to select a region of parameter space with high completeness when measuring the space density .",
    "if a region has high photometric incompleteness , then many objects have been missed from the input catalogues , e.g. compact objects that are thought to be stars , lsbgs .",
    "we have no information about these objects and can only speculate on their importance to the overall luminosity and mass density . in regions where the photometric incompleteness is high ,",
    "then the redshift incompleteness will also be high , but there can be additional regions where the photometric incompleteness is low , but the redshift incompleteness is high .",
    "this may be for a variety of reasons : low signal to noise in the spectrograph , or objects which are only found in clusters may be missed preferentially because of the minimum separation of fibres .",
    "thus the calculation of the space density will only be robust in regions where both the photometric and the redshift completeness are high . in regions where the redshift completeness is low",
    ", the question is : have the missing objects got the same redshift distribution as those objects with redshifts ? this may be a plausible assumption , but objects with spectral lines close to sky lines may be missed preferentially , or objects with weak emission or absorption may be missed in preference to those objects with strong lines . if the photometric incompleteness is high , not only do we have these problems , but we also have to wonder if there is redshift or other bias in the missing objects . as shown in section  [ sub : typ_miss ] , there are many blended objects and compact objects missing from the 2dfgrs .",
    "these may be preferentially missed from cluster environments where a lot of galaxies have a similar redshift .",
    "thus the redshift distribution seen in that region of parameter space may be less clustered than the true redshift distribution .    fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_ph_tdf ] shows the photometric completeness of the combined 2dfgrs dataset as a function of both magnitude and surface brightness .",
    "[ fig : comp_ph_sdss ] shows the equivalent plot for the sdss - edr . in the case of the 2dfgrs",
    ", the completeness is very low ( @xmath173 per cent ) for @xmath174 and also very low for faint high surface brightness galaxies , that may be confused with stars .",

    "[ fig : comp_z_sdss ] shows the redshift completeness of the sdss - edr .",
    "for the 2dfgrs the original spectroscopic magnitude limit was @xmath125 mag , but this has now become a variable with plate number and dust correction . the analysis above showed that the limit for high completeness is @xmath176 mag . for the sdss - edr ,",
    "the spectroscopic limit is @xmath177 mag for most galaxies .",
    "the filter conversion equation is @xmath178 which converts to @xmath179 . using a typical @xmath180 , @xmath181 mag for the sdss - edr .",
    "however , the completeness may drop before this limit or after this limit due to the variation in colours of galaxies in the sample .",
    "it is apparent that the redshift completeness of the sdss - edr falls off @xmath182 mag brighter than the 2dfgrs .",
    "the 2dfgrs is more complete than the sdss - edr because it has been finished whereas there are some small gaps in the sdss - edr spectroscopic release . in the mgc",
    "these gaps occur at @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 .",
    "the spectroscopic sample of the sdss - edr was selected in the @xmath82 filter , so bluer galaxies will have a brighter @xmath187 and redder galaxies will have a fainter @xmath187 .",
    "it is not the overall redshift completeness that concerns us , but rather how the completeness varies with magnitude and surface brightness .",
    "there is a reduced level of redshift completeness in both surveys for galaxies with @xmath188 mag arcsec@xmath1 , whereas the photometric completeness dropped most significantly for objects with @xmath169 mag arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "in this paper we used a deep wide field ccd imaging survey , the mgc ( liske et al .",
    "2003 ) to test the photometric accuracy and completeness of the 2dfgrs and sdss - edr , as well as the photometric accuracy of scos and sdss - dr1 .",
    "the main photometric and completeness results for the 2dfgrs and sdss are summarised in tables  [ tab : phot ] ,  [ tab : phstars ] ,  [ tab : phtsb ] ,  [ tab : mcls ] , and  [ tab : art ] .",

    "the stellar catalogue has photometry with @xmath190 mag with a scatter of 0.046 mag , once the difference between kron and petrosian magnitudes and the field - to - field scatter has been taken into account . the field - to - field scatter in the mgc is @xmath191 mag .",
    "we estimate that the `` galaxy measurement '' error , a combination of decreasing signal - to - noise per pixel and the differences between kron and petrosian magnitudes contribute to a scatter of 0.06 magnitudes in the galaxy errors .",
    "there is a small scale error of @xmath192 per cent for bright galaxies , but faint galaxies and stars have extremely small scale errors of @xmath182 per cent compared with the mgc .",
    "however , the fluxes of low surface brightness galaxies @xmath188 mag arcsec@xmath1 are systematically underestimated by @xmath193 mag .",
    "the sdss - edr has similar scale - errors and errors with surface brightness to sdss - dr1 .",
    "the significant differences , are an offset of @xmath194 magnitudes , with the sdss - dr1 magnitudes slightly brighter and also a reduced standard deviation per galaxy for the sdss - dr1 .    since the 2dfgrs and scos magnitudes in the 2dfgrs database",
    "have been calibrated using sdss - edr photometry , the offset w.r.t .",
    "the mgc should be the same and indeed it is within the expected errors .",
    "of the four data sets compared to the mgc , the 2dfgrs has the worst photometry with @xmath5 mag with a scatter of 0.142 mag per galaxy and a very large scale error , @xmath195 per cent which probably comes from non - linearities in the photometric plates causing the flux of high - surface brightness objects to be significantly underestimated ( see fig  [ fig : phot_sb ] ) .",
    "high surface brightness objects have their fluxes underestimated in the 2dfgrs by @xmath196 mag .",
    "the scos magnitudes are a significant improvement on the 2dfgrs magnitudes , with a lower variance and especially with regard to the variation in @xmath197 with surface brightness .",
    "this results in a reduced scale error and the scos photometry is well matched to the sdss - edr .",
    "however , while the scale - error compared to the mgc is lower than the 2dfgrs scale - error , it is still quite large ( @xmath198 per cent ) .",
    "both the scos and sdss - dr1 show significant improvements when compared to the 2dfdrs and sdss - edr respectively , as expected with later releases .",
    "the main source of error in the comparison of the offsets is the colour equations used to compare the photometry .",
    "these need to be accurate to @xmath199 magnitudes before random errors become the main source of error in the comparison between 2dfgrs and mgc .    while it is impossible to say for certain which survey has the best photometry , as all the checks are relative , some trends can be seen .",
    "the mgc seems to be fainter by 0.04 mag than all the other surveys , but since the 2dfgrs and scos are matched to the sdss - edr , we have to be very careful on this matter .",
    "the scale - error results can not be interpreted in an absolute sense either .",
    "however the standard deviation per galaxy can be a useful indicator .",
    "it is lowest between the mgc and dr1 ( apart from between the edr and dr1 which are taken from the same data ) indicating that these are the two best surveys .",
    "it is difficult to tell if the mgc or the dr1 is the best since the mgc has the lowest standard deviation compared to the apm , but dr1 has the lowest compared to scos .",
    "we find that @xmath13 per cent of the objects classified as galaxies in the 2dfgrs are stars , @xmath14 per cent are multiple objects and @xmath200 per cent artefacts .",
    "when compared to the mgc galaxy catalogue , we find that the 2dfgrs is incomplete by @xmath15 per cent by @xmath120 mag .",
    "since the spectroscopic data show that @xmath16 per cent of the mgc galaxy catalogue are misclassified as stars then we conclude that @xmath17 per cent of galaxies are missing from the 2dfgrs brighter than @xmath120 mag .",
    "the missing galaxies that are seen in the mgc galaxy catalogue can be split into four classes : lsbgs @xmath151 per cent ; unresolved objects , @xmath149 per cent ; blended objects , @xmath148 per cent ; normal galaxies , @xmath150 per cent .",
    "this is in line with the findings of pimbblet et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    in the sdss - edr",
    ", there is @xmath18 per cent stellar contamination , @xmath19 per cent galaxies are misclassified as stars and @xmath201 per cent are artefacts .",

    "the fraction of qsos in the stellar catalogues of the mgc and sdss - edr is @xmath203 per cent .",
    "the true impact of any incompleteness on measurements of the luminosity function can only be known with assurance by constructing a high and uniformly complete redshift survey .",
    "we have found that even modern ccd surveys such as the mgc and sdss - edr are missing @xmath204 per cent of the galaxy sample due to difficulties in star - galaxy separation .",
    "this means that number counts and luminosity functions will have to be revised upwards , and the shapes may have to be revised if the redshift distribution of these objects does not follow the redshift distribution of the known galaxy population .",
    "since these galaxies are hard to separate from stars , they are likely to be compact galaxies , possibly from the same population as found by drinkwater et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in fornax .",
    "they estimated that @xmath205 per cent of compact galaxies were missed from 2dfgrs .",
    "this is compatible to our value of @xmath16 per cent , given that the fornax cluster at @xmath206 is significantly closer than the average galaxy in our sample ( @xmath207 ) . at the distance to fornax fewer galaxies should be unresolved since they would have to have scale lengths @xmath208 pc .",
    "the constraints on the galaxies in our sample are @xmath209 kpc on average , with a final fraction @xmath210 per cent of our galaxy sample in the same range as the fornax cluster members . since all these scale lengths are upper limits it is impossible to say for certain whether these constitute the same types of galaxy .",
