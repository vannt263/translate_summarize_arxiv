    "frictional drag between two spatially separated two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems is a powerful tool to probe electron - electron ( @xmath15 ) interaction and is of current intensive research interest both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the drag effect manifests itself when a current with a density @xmath16 driven along the layer @xmath17 induces , via momentum transfer , an electric field @xmath18 in the layer @xmath19 under the condition that the layer @xmath19 is an open circuit @xcite .",
    "much experimental work was done in the magnetic field - free case to measure the drag effect in a coupled 2d and 3d electron system @xcite , between two 2d electron systems ( 2des ) @xcite , two 2d hole systems ( 2dhs ) @xcite , and also in a coupled 2des-2dhs @xcite .",
    "theoretical work on the frictional drag has been devoted to explain different momentum transfer mechanisms in a coupled 2des-3des @xcite , 2des-2dhs @xcite , 2des-2des @xcite , and recently in a 2dhs-2dhs @xcite .",
    "also , plasmon - enhancement of the drag due to many - body correlations at high temperatures has been studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "two possible interlayer @xmath15 interaction mechanisms have been considered : one is the direct electrostatic coulomb scattering and the other is the phonon - mediated effective interaction .",
    "the coulomb drag calculations predict a @xmath20 temperature dependence for the transresistivity @xmath21 and a strong inter - layer spacing ( @xmath22 dependence as @xmath23 @xcite@xmath24 however , the experimental results do not support the pure coulomb mechanism @xcite .",
    "the observed drag has a peak when the electron densities match , @xmath25 , and the scaled transresistivity , @xmath26 , deviates from a constant value demonstrating a peak as a function of @xmath2 well below bloch - grneisen temperature .",
    "also , the measured @xmath21 for separations at least up to 50 nm exhibits almost no dependence on @xmath3 and its value beyond @xmath27 nm is much bigger to be accounted for by coulomb interaction alone .",
    "this led gramila _",
    "et al_. @xcite to propose an acoustical phonon - mediated scattering mechanism for the drag .",
    "this mechanism was studied extensively in refs .  .",
    "the theoretical results are satisfactory to explain the main experimental findings .",
    "the phonon - mediated drag due to the bare electron - phonon ( @xmath28 ) coupling diverges when the transferred energy , @xmath29 from the layer @xmath17 to the layer @xmath19 is close to @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the transferred in - plane momentum ) .",
    "this divergence is eliminated by taking into account other scattering mechanisms such as screening and/or the finite phonon mean free path @xcite .",
    "it is found that , despite the weak @xmath28 coupling , the effective phonon - mediated @xmath15 interaction remains strong and competes with the coulomb interaction . in general , @xmath28 scattering in 2dess is qualitatively different between in the small angle scattering ( sas ) temperature region , @xmath32 , and in the large angle scattering ( las ) temperature region , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the speed of sound and @xmath35 the fermi wave vector @xcite . in the sas region , @xmath36 and this results in the power law dependence of @xmath37 on the other hand , in the las region , @xmath38 and @xmath0 varies linearly in @xmath2 . as a consequence , @xmath39 has a peak at the crossover from the sas to las temperature region at the peak temperature @xmath40 . in the las temperature region",
    "the momentum transfer is most efficient when momenta of the emitted and absorbed phonons are determined by the same fermi wave vector @xmath41 , this results in the peaked transresistivity when @xmath25 . in the sas region",
    "there is no cutoff related to @xmath35 that @xmath0 shows a monotonous behavior as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "the frictional drag has been also investigated in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the drag rate has been measured experimentally in a coupled 2des @xcite , 2dhs @xcite as well in a 2des-2dhs @xcite .",
    "also , the response of composite fermions to large wave vector scattering has been studied through phonon magnetodrag measurements @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent measurements reveal a new regime of the magnetodrag in a coupled 2des at mismatched densities @xmath43 in which the polarity of the drag voltage is opposite that normally found for electron systems @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations were mostly carried out with incorporating the direct coulomb mechanism @xcite .",
    "these calculations show reasonable agreement with the experiments @xcite that at low temperatures @xmath0 demonstrates an analog of the shubnikov - de haas oscillations with amplitudes by two order of magnitude enhanced compared to the zero field drag signal . at the matched densities",
    "the measured magnetodrag has a double - peak structure in magnetic field in the inter - quantum hall plateau regions @xcite .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the earlier calculations of the coulomb magnetodrag by bnsager _",
    "et al_. @xcite who predicted this behavior caused by the interplay of screening and landau quantization . however , the calculations by wu",
    "_ @xcite and the experiments by hill _",
    "@xcite  show oscillations without the double peak structure .",
    "the critical test of the theory was performed in a recent experiment by lok _",
    "@xcite , which confirms that the transresistivity does not show the predicted double peak structure for the spin split landau levels and the double - peak structure at higher filling factors is not caused by the screening effect @xcite .",
    "notice also , as against to the zero magnetic field case , the scaled transresistivity @xmath39 due to the pure coulomb mechanism shows a peaked temperature dependence in the finite magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "in addition , the coulomb magnetodrag calculations @xcite reveal new features associated with interlayer magnetoplasmons , that was observed  also experimentally @xcite .    as we described in the previous paragraph , the phonon - mediated drag is the dominant mechanism in the zero magnetic field case in a coupled 2des , except for very closely spaced layers @xcite .",
    "further , it was reported recently that the effective phonon and the coulomb contributions to drag were comparable in a coupled 2dhs even with closely spaced layers .",
    "the phonon - mediated drag effect has been also investigated experimentally in the finite magnetic fields @xcite where it was found also that the phonon contribution was prevalent in the coupled 2des , 2dhs , and 2des-2dhs with large barriers . up to now , however , it is rare to find theoretical works on the frictional drag mediated by phonon exchange in a finite magnetic field .",
    "the exceptions are recent treatments of the phonon drag at the landau level filling factor @xmath44 by chern - simons composite fermion theory @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the direct coulomb and the effective phonon - mediated frictional drag in a coupled 2des exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field theoretically . for this system",
    "we calculate the dispersion relation of the intra - landau level magnetoplasmons by taking into account finite temperature and distinguish the magnetoplasmon contribution to the magnetodrag .",
    "we calculate @xmath0 as a function of magnetic field @xmath1 , temperature @xmath2 , and interlayer spacing @xmath3 , and determine the relative contributions of coulomb versus phonon - mediated @xmath15 interaction to magnetodrag    this paper is organized as follows . in the next sec .",

    "the main theoretical framework to calculate @xmath0 is the fermi liquid theory where the  interlayer @xmath15 interaction is treated perturbatively .",
    "the expression for @xmath0 can be derived by using the linearized boltzmann equation @xcite or the memory function formalisms starting from the kubo formula @xcite .",

    "@xmath239 increases strongly with @xmath240 and this determines mainly the behavior of @xmath237 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fg4 ] that for @xmath4 nm @xmath39 tends to zero at low @xmath2 in contrast to its finite value for @xmath5 nm . at temperatures above @xmath241 @xmath242 , and the screening function @xmath243 for such large arguments is small and increasing in @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior together with the @xmath244 prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) determines the temperature dependence of @xmath0 at high @xmath2 .",

    "[ fg7 ] ) .",
    "notice , as against the situation of the coulomb magnetodrag , even for small @xmath250 k the integrand is approximately zero in the region of small @xmath97 and has strongly pronounced peak at large @xmath97 .",
    "the main highest peak of the integrand near @xmath251 , as we already discussed , is related to the maximum of @xmath252 at @xmath253 corresponding to @xmath254 the left small peak of the integrand near @xmath248 is related to another maximum of the function @xmath252 at @xmath255 ( @xmath256 ) and also to the maximum of the function @xmath257 at @xmath258 ( @xmath259 ) .",
    "this second peak contribution to @xmath237 shifts the actual crossover temperature of @xmath237 to the left so that @xmath260 k ( fig .  [ fg4 ] ) .",
    "one can see , however , that the positions of the first two peaks of the integrand is not far from the magnetoplasmon energies @xmath261 therefore the magnetoplasmons contribute also to the formation of these peaks to some extend .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from the very weak dependence of the total @xmath0 on @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] ) that the magnetoplasmon contribution to @xmath0 for @xmath4  nm is a small correction to the phonon contribution .",
    "the third peak of the integrand in the very close vicinity of the upper edge of the landau band is a pure magnetoplasmon effect ( cf .",
    "[ fg6 ] and fig .",
    "[ fg7 ] ) . immediately below the upper edge of landau band the magnetoplasmon damping is very small and this results in the very sharp peak of the integrand with a relatively small contribution to @xmath237 .",
    "thus , at high temperatures we obtain that for @xmath4 nm @xmath0 decreases slowly with @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fg4 ] ) .",
    "this extraordinary temperature dependence of @xmath0 is mainly due to the weak screening effect at large interlayer separations and the screening is weak because the phonons with large energies and momenta realize @xmath15 interaction between remote layers .",
    "notice that the @xmath244 dependence of @xmath237 for the pure coulomb interlayer interaction in one of the typical scattering regions was also reported by khaetskii and nazarov @xcite .",
    "as far as we know at present no magnetodrag measurements are available in the above regime and the experimental test of the temperature dependence of phonon magnetodrag is critical .",
    "we have calculated the transresistivity between spatially separated electron layers in a perpendicular magnetic fields .",
    "we take into account both direct electrostatic coulomb and effective phonon mediated @xmath15 interaction . for this system",
    "we calculate the dispersion relation of the intra - landau level magnetoplasmons within the random phase approximation at the finite temperatures and distinguish the magnetoplasmon contribution to the magnetodrag .",
    "we find the strikingly different magnetic field and temperature dependence of the transresistivity for the small and large interlayer separations .",
    "when @xmath5 nm , the transresistivity shows a slight dip as a function of @xmath1 in the middle of the second spin - degenerated landau band with the total @xmath0 about @xmath6 @xmath7 ( the phonon mean free path is @xmath262 @xmath263 m , the mobility @xmath232",
    "m@xmath233 v@xmath234 s@xmath234 , @xmath8 k , and @xmath264 @xmath265 m@xmath152 ) , which , depending on @xmath1 , includes about @xmath266 to @xmath191 of the phonon contribution due to piezoelectric interaction .",
    "when @xmath4 nm , the coulomb contribution to magnetodrag is negligible . and , @xmath0 shows no dip and the total drag around filling factor @xmath188 is about @xmath9 times less than the value for @xmath196 nm .",
    "this is in good agreement with the experimental findings by rubel _ et _ _",
    "al_.  @xcite .",
    "the scaled transresistivity @xmath267 has a peaked temperature dependence for both @xmath5 and @xmath178 nm . at low @xmath2 , @xmath39 remains finite for @xmath196 nm , while for @xmath4 nm it tends to zero . at high @xmath2 , @xmath184 is approximately linear in @xmath2 for @xmath5 nm while for @xmath268 nm it decreases slowly with @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the peak of @xmath267 as function of @xmath2 is very sharp for the large separation @xmath268 nm .",
