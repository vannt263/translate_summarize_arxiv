    "the detected gravitationally lensed quasar images have a separation which is smaller than the resolution of current gamma - ray detectors .",
    "the time resolution of gamma - ray instruments however is superior in many aspects to the optical instruments .",
    "the time - delays we are looking for , come in two flavours that define two types of searches .",
    "we can compare the shape and spectra of two bursts coming from the same part of the sky or we can look for similarly shaped pulses in a single grb s stream of photons . in this work we focus on the first scenario .",
    "we just mention the second case for its simplicity .",
    "the equation from @xcite defines the characteristic mass scale of the point lens up to a factor @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1 @xmath2 is the time delay between the pulses , @xmath3 is the ratio of the peak counts .",
    "this model is deemed accurate for time delays of @xmath4 to @xmath5 s with lens masses ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . for time delays of days to months",
    "we use the a single isothermal sphere model . in this case",
    "it is impossible to ascertain the lens mass , only a combination if the angular diameter distances ( lens - source ( @xmath8 ) , observer - lens ( @xmath9 ) and observer - source ( @xmath10 ) ) and the velocity dispersion ( @xmath11 ) : @xmath12 in this work we will be searching for bursts from the same part of the sky .",
    "we used the bursts in the fermi / gbm burst table .",
    "we imposed an upper limit on the error radius of @xmath13 .",
    "we selected pairs of bursts closer than two - times their positional errors ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the next step was creating pairs of lightcurves and their cross - correlation curve on the same timescale for comparison .",
    "each of the resulting @xmath15 figures was inspected for similarities with the aid of the cross - correlation curve at two timescales ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 s ) .",
    "if the burst was deemed interesting , we proceeded to compare the spectral parameters by fitting for the spectrum .",
    "simultaneously we check if the early burst is brighter than the later .",
    "this is a necessary condition for the time delays @xcite .",
    "the typical echo timescale is from days to months but no longer than @xmath18 months ( the elapsed time from the first fermi trigger ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +",
    "as in @xcite , a list of close calls was established .",
    "examples can be seen in the table below .",
    "none of these pairs passed the spectral inspection convincingly .",
    "we have relaxed our @xmath14 criterion to @xmath19 and checked the resulting @xmath20 pairs , but found no additional candidates . +      both of these bursts have three peaks , with roughly the same time between them .",
    "it is curious that the elapsed time between them is roughly one year .",
    "we fitted a band spectrum for the first two peaks .",
    "we compare the low - energy spectral indices(@xmath21 ) as both bursts have most of their emission in this range and not all of the other spectral parameters could be constrained . while for 080730 @xmath21 decreases slightly from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , for 090730 @xmath21 decreases ( from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ) .",
    "even though the indices have some overlap , we feel it is hard to put forward convincing arguments for a lensing scenario in this pair .",
    "+     s.,title=\"fig : \" ] +      these short bursts were also put forward as worthy for a spectral inspection .",
    "it turned out that 090429 has a significantly higher peak energy ( @xmath26 kev _ vs. _ @xmath27 kev ) , though the spectral indices agree fairly well ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) @xcite +     s.,title=\"fig : \" ] +      there is no detector response matrix ( drm ) available for 090516.853 and no gcn was published for this trigger .",
    "this prevented us from spectral fitting and from determining the burst - detector angle , hence the uncertainty on @xmath32 . in spite of a visible extended emission region unique to the lightcurve of 090514.006",
    ", we considered this a good candidate based on the similarities of the profile of the main event .",
    "we are waiting for the release of the drms complete the analysis .",

    "we carried out a search for lensing signatures in an up - to - date burst sample .",
    "we selected bursts closer than @xmath33 and found three presentable candidates for a lensing events that occurred at long timescales ( days to months ) .",
    "inspection of the spectra casted doubts on the viability of the lensing scenario in two cases and we need more data to decide in a third case .",
