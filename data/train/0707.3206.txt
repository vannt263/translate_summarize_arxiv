    "noise induced transport by brownian motors or",
    " ratchets \" has attracted the attention of an increasing number of researchers due to its biological interest as well as its potential technological applications . since the pioneering works , besides the built - in ratchet - like bias and correlated fluctuations , several different aspects have been studied , such as tilting @xcite and pulsating @xcite potentials , velocity inversions @xcite , etc .",
    "there are relevant reviews @xcite indicating the biological and/or technological motivations for the study of ratchets as well as showing the state of the art .    among other aspects",
    ", ratchets has been used to explain the unidirectional transport of molecular motors within a biological realm @xcite . among the different motor proteins ,",
    "kinesin has attracted considerable attention motivated by experimental results in which the dynamical details of its motion can be measured @xcite .",
    "kinesin is a protein with two heads that performs a walk along the microtubule inside cells .",
    "motivated by these experimental results , several researchers have introduced diverse models in order to understand the particular form of walking of kinesin @xcite . usually those models consider a walker moving along an asymmetric ratchet potential mediated by noise .",
    "this walker has two feet that are represented by two particles nonlinearly coupled through a bistable potential . among those models ,",
    "there is a recent one introduced in @xcite including all the above indicated ingredients , where the walker moves along a track formed by an asymmetric potential , being subjected to two independent white noise sources acting on each of the two particles and to a common external harmonic force .",
    "it was observed that the current @xmath0 as function of noise intensity @xmath1 presents a maximum , conforming another example of the constructive role of noise .",
    "recent studies on the effect of a non gaussian noise on several noise induced phenomena , have shown the existence of strong effects on the systems response . in those studies , opposing to the most usual cases that only consider gaussian white noises , such an effect was analyzed in stochastic resonance , noise induced transitions ,  standard \" ratchets , etc @xcite .",
    "this form of noise was motivated by the nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite . in this work",
    "we want to analyze the effect of this form of colored and non gaussian noise over the kinesin ratchet model introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we used a mean field approximation and exploited a recently developed technique @xcite . through the variation of a parameter @xmath2",
    ", this form of noise offers the possibility of analyzing the departure from gaussian behavior ( corresponding to @xmath3 ) . since subtle change of environment conditions can produce drastic changes in biological process , such effects could be very relevant .",
    "it is worth here indicating that a related mean field approximation was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "in the next section we show the mean - field approximation and how reliable it is , based on the good agreement with known results for the gaussian case .",
    "the third section presents the statistical properties of the non gaussian noise , and the form of the current that results after applying the _ effective markovian approximation _ in the present problem . in",
    "the following section we present the results when we depart from the gaussian behavior , that is varying the parameter @xmath2 . finally , in the last section we present some conclusions .",
    "the stochastic dimensionless differential equations for the two particles in the overdamped regime , whose coordinates are indicated by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dimensionless ratchet potential @xmath8\\ ] ] the constant @xmath9 $ ] was chosen in such a way that @xmath10 .",
    "the constant @xmath11 is introduced in order to center the minima of the periodic potential on integer values .",
    "the dimensionless amplitude of the ratchet potential is indicated by @xmath12 .",
    "the dimensionless bistable potential @xmath13 , that represents the nonlinear coupling between the two particles , is given by @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the dimensionless amplitude of this bistable potential and @xmath16 is the distance between the two minima .    in the original model , it is assumed that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are gaussian white noises with zero mean and correlation @xmath19 , with @xmath1 the intensity of the statistically independent noises . in our model , as indicated at the introduction , we assume they are non gaussian colored noises , with characteristics that we will briefly indicated later . clearly , the model also considers an external harmonic force .    in @xcite this model",
    "was analytically solved . however , in order to consider the non gaussian colored noise case , we need to introduce a different approach . for that purpose",
    ", we consider a mean field approximation ( mfa ) @xcite .",
    "for the present case , such a mfa consist in the following approximation for @xmath20 @xmath21,\\ ] ] with @xmath22 , and clearly we have @xmath23 . after applying the mfa ,",
    "the equations for both variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 results to be of the same form .",
    "hence , we can reduce the problem to a single equation describing the model system @xmath24 where @xmath25 .    in order to test the mfa ,",
    "we start analyzing the gaussian white case , and show that it gives similar qualitative results than the numerical simulations and the analytical solution for the original model @xcite .",
    "hence , in eq .",
    "( [ eqdifst ] ) , we start assuming that @xmath26 is a gaussian white noise with the same behavior than the @xmath27 s .    considering an adiabatical approximation in order to decouple the external harmonic force from the rest ,",
    "the corresponding fokker - planck equation can be solved assuming periodic boundary conditions .",
    "even though @xmath28 is non periodic [ due to @xmath29 being non periodic ] , we can still assume such a periodic behavior since both feet are never too far away from each other , the strong slope of the attractive potential preventing it to occur . in fig .",
    "1 it is shown @xmath30 vs. @xmath4 with and without the indicated approximation . in fig .",
    "2 we show @xmath31 vs. @xmath4 , again with and without the approximation .",
    "it is apparent that the curves looks quite alike .    considering the adiabatical approximation ,",
    "the corresponding stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation is @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 @xmath34 a normalization constant , and @xmath35 the period .",
    "hence , numerically solving @xmath36 we can obtain the current @xmath37 @xcite as @xmath38,\\ ] ] and the net current is obtained as @xmath39 with @xmath40 .    in order to check these results in fig .",
    "3 we depict @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 . the curve presents a maximum for an  optimal \" value of the noise intensity , which is qualitatively similar to the one obtained in @xcite . with the support offered by this agreement",
    ", we are now in position to use this same approach for the non gaussian colored noise case .",
    "we consider now the non gaussian colored noise case as in @xcite . hence , in eq .",

    "for @xmath58 , this distribution can not be normalized .",
    "note that keeping @xmath1 constant , when increasing @xmath2 the dispersion of the distribution also increases . in @xcite the second moment of the distribution was obtained .",
    "this moment is related to the intensity of the non gaussian noise , and is given by @xmath59 that diverges for @xmath60 . for @xmath61 , the correlation time of the process @xmath26 , that was defined in detail in @xcite , it was not possible to find an analytical expression .",
    "however , it is known @xcite that for @xmath62 it diverges as @xmath63 . in @xcite @xmath61 vs. @xmath2 was numerically calculated for the range @xmath64 .",
    "the following analytical approximation , accurate within the indicated range , was found @xmath65.\\ ] ]      the fokker - planck equation for the present case , that is the system described by the langevin equation indicated by eq .",
    "( [ eqdifst ] ) with @xmath26 the non gaussian noise , has a known structure . after applying the _ effective markovian approximation _",
    "as exploited in @xcite , such an equation has the form @xmath66 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial^{2}_{x } [ b(x)p(x , t)],\\ ] ] where @xmath67 with @xmath68;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath69^{2 } }      { b_1(x)+b_2(x ) } \\right]^{2}\\ ] ] with @xmath70^{2 }      \\\\      & & b_2(x)=\\left[1-(\\tau/2d_{w})(q-1)v_{eff}'^{2 } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the prima indicates a derivative respect to @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding stationary solution of the indicated fokker - planck equation is @xcite @xmath71 with @xmath34 a normalization constant , and @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "then , using eqs .",
    "( [ eqcm ] ) , as ( [ jt ] ) and ( [ j ] ) we can obtain the current @xmath0 .",
    "in what follows we present several results for the case of submitting the system to a non gaussian noise , mainly restricting ourselves to the range @xmath75 , which is the range where our evaluation is , in principle , valid . in all cases , except we indicated something different , we adopted @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath2 , for different values of @xmath82 . looking at the left part of the picture , we identify the curves , from top to bottom , with the values @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the entanglement between the dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath82 is apparent . for low values of @xmath82 ( @xmath90 )",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 corresponds to an initial plateau for @xmath48 and a fast ( step like ) decrease for @xmath91 .",
    "when @xmath82 increases ( @xmath92 ) , @xmath93 adopts a bell s shape , with a maximum that shifts to larger values of @xmath2 for increasing @xmath82 .",
    "it is worth noting that for large values of @xmath82 , the relevant values for the current will only occur when @xmath2 takes values within the indicated bell - like region .    as in previous studies on the effect of non gaussian noise on other systems",
    "@xcite we conclude that the observed change of behavior is associated with the process @xmath26 , that is with the departure from gaussian behavior ( @xmath44 ) and the associated changes in @xmath94 . as indicated before , for @xmath48",
    "there is a cut - off that prevents that @xmath26 reaches large values , while for @xmath91 @xmath26 can reach very large values . for small values of @xmath82",
    "it is expected that the current @xmath93 will not be very sensitive to such a cut - off , as the probability for @xmath26 to reach those cut - off values is very small . in opposition , for large values of @xmath82 we expect that @xmath93 becomes highly sensitive to the cut - off .",
    "it seems to be the case as @xmath0 varies very slowly with @xmath2 ( for @xmath48 ) when @xmath82 is small , while for large values of @xmath82 just the opposite occurs .",
    "however , for @xmath91 , it is the tail of the spd that mainly contributes to build the current @xcite . as indicated above , for @xmath48 ( that is , for the case without tail ) , and large values of @xmath82",
    ", @xmath0 drastically decreases when @xmath2 decreases .",
    "let us select one of the curves for @xmath0 with a bell shape , and look into the spd for values of @xmath2 below , at , and above of the maximum of that curve .",
    "such analysis is shown in fig .",
    "we have chosen @xmath95 , @xmath96 ( below ) , @xmath97 ( at the maximum ) and @xmath98 ( above ) .",
    "we observe that for the case of the maximum , the spd is symmetric with two peaks at both ends of the space period .",
    "however , when departing from such  optimal \" condition , the spd looses its symmetry . in one hand ,",
    "when @xmath2 is at the left of the maximum ( @xmath96 ) a new peak emerges at the central zone of the period . on the other hand , when @xmath2 is to right of the maximum",
    ", there are two peaks that arise between the previously indicated ones . in both cases ,",
    "the prize of these additional peaks is that the spd decreases at both ends , indicating a reduction of @xmath0 .",
    "the same behavior was also observed in all cases where @xmath93 adopts a bell s shape .",
    "we also compare the spd behavior for the case when @xmath93 has a step - like shape , and note that for values of @xmath2 within the plateau , the spd is like the one corresponding to the case of the maximum of @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "3 , for @xmath97 ) , while for values of @xmath2 beyond the step , the spd is analogous to the one corresponding to a value of @xmath2 located at the right of the maximum ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "it seems that the current reaches a maximum when one feet follows the other , and their separation is kept constant , and equal to a period .",
    "we have also analyzed the gaussian case ( @xmath44 ) for different values of @xmath82 , with results that essentially reproduces those of fig .",
    "5 . in short , for small @xmath82 the curves are analogous to those obtained for large @xmath2 ( having four peaks ) , while for large @xmath82 the shapes resembles the ones for small @xmath2 ( having three peaks )",
    ".    figure 6 depicts @xmath37 the current before its time averaging as function of time , for a fixed @xmath82 and different values of @xmath2 .",
    "it is apparent that the current adopts both , positive and negative values along the period of the external forcing .",
    "we observe that for @xmath99 ( where @xmath100 reaches its largest values ) there is a balance between positive and negative current s values yielding , in average , a small net current .",
    "when @xmath2 increases , the negative values of the current reduces , the indicated balance is also reduced , and the net current increases . for even larger values of @xmath2 ( @xmath101 ) ,",
    "the positive value of the current is reduced , while the negative one tend to zero , and the net current decreases .",
    "we finally analyze the system s behavior with @xmath61 .",
    "firstly , we observed that inside the studied range , @xmath0 varies almost linearly with @xmath61 .",
    "since the corresponding slope change its sign with @xmath2 and @xmath82 , we choose to look into the behavior of @xmath102 . hence , in fig .",
    "7 we show @xmath102 vs. @xmath2 for different values of @xmath82 , while in fig .",
    "8 we show @xmath102 vs. @xmath82 for different values of @xmath2 . the sensitivity of @xmath102 against variations of @xmath2 and @xmath82 is apparent , and the changes in the slope s sign are clearly seen .",
    "in line with some recent work @xcite , we have here analyzed the effect of a colored and non gaussian noise over the kinesin ratchet model introduced in @xcite . as was discussed in @xcite",
    ", there are strong experimental evidences that noise sources within biological systems can not be in general gaussian @xcite .",
    "this fact gives strong support to the study of the effect of non gaussian noises within a biological motivated context .    in order to make an almost analytical treatment ,",
    "we have here exploited a mean - field like approach , that shows a nice agreement when it is tested against known results @xcite for the gaussian case ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "hence , we can trust the results we have obtained when varying the parameter @xmath2 . for the adopted form of noise , such variation offers the possibility of analyzing the departure ( @xmath103 ) from the gaussian behavior ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "when analyzing the dependence of the current @xmath0 on @xmath82 and @xmath2 , we have confirmed the existence , for a fixed value of @xmath2 , of a maximum or  optimal \" current as function of @xmath82 .",
    "what is new , is that for fixed @xmath82 , there is also an optimal value of @xmath2 yielding a maximum value of the current .",
    "more , in general such a value corresponds to a non gaussian situation ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "such a results could be understood from the behavior of the spd for different values of @xmath2 , as well as from the current s time dependence ( that is , before the time averaging ) . regarding the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath105",
    ", we have seen that it is linear . however , analyzing its slope ( @xmath106 ) it becomes apparent the possibilities of even changing the sign of such a slope varying both , @xmath2 for fixed @xmath82 , or @xmath82 for fixed @xmath2 .",
    "the indicated results show us the richness of behavior that we can found when departing from the gaussian situation .",
    "it is apparent that those results could be of relevance not only for biological studies , but for technological applications as well .",
    "this point was discussed in general in @xcite , and particularly for the case of ratchets in @xcite . from a technological point of view , such a noise source offers a variety of forms of controlling and/or optimizing the transport process .",
    "clearly , the exploitation of an approach like the one used in @xcite , based in a coordinate separation , could offer a more transparent and better description of this system s physics .",
    "in addition a numerical validation of the whole approach is required . also , another aspect that requires further analysis is the case when @xmath16 is non - commensurate with the unit cell of the ratchet potential .",
    "all these aspects will be the subject of forthcoming work @xcite .",
