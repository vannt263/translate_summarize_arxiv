    "in this proceedings we present preliminary results from a k@xmath1k@xmath1 femtoscopy study by the alice experiment @xcite in 7 tev @xmath0 collisions from the cern lhc . the main motivations to carry out k@xmath1k@xmath1 femtoscopic studies to augment the usual identical charged @xmath7 femtoscopic studies are 1 ) to extend the @xmath3 range of the charged @xmath7 studies , 2 ) since k@xmath1 is uncharged , it is not necessary to apply a final - state coulomb correction to the pairs as is necessary for charged @xmath7 pairs , and 3 ) one can in principle obtain complementary information about the collision interaction region by using different types of mesons .",
    "previous k@xmath1k@xmath1 studies have been carried out in lep @xmath8 collisions @xcite , hera @xmath9 collisions @xcite and rhic au - au collisions @xcite . due to statistics limitations , a single set of femtoscopic source parameters , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath5 , was extracted in each of these studies . to our knowledge , the present study is the first femtoscopic k@xmath1k@xmath1 study to be carried out a ) in @xmath0 collisions and b ) in more than one multiplicity and @xmath3 bin .",
    "k@xmath1 identification and momentum determination were carried out with particle tracking in the alice time projection chamber ( tpc ) and alice inner tracking system ( its ) @xcite .",
    "the decay channel k@xmath10 was used for particle identification .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows an invariant mass plot of candidate k@xmath1 vertices for all event multiplicities and @xmath3 along with a gaussian + quadratic fit to the data .",
    "a vertex was identified with a k@xmath1 if the invariant mass of the candidate @xmath11 pair associated with it fell in the range 0.490 - 0.504 gev/@xmath12 . as seen in figure [ fig1 ] , the k@xmath1 purity in this case",
    "is found to be 96% .",
    "k@xmath1 purities of similar values are also found in the other multiplicity and @xmath3 bins used in this study .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows a k@xmath1k@xmath1 correlation function in the invariant momentum difference variable @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the 3-momentum and energy differences between the two particles respectively , for all multiplicity and @xmath3 .",
    "the three main features seen in this correlation function are 1 ) a well - defined enhancement region for @xmath16 gev / c , 2 ) a non - flat baseline for @xmath17 gev / c and 3 ) a small peak at @xmath18 gev / c . considering feature 3 ) first , fitting a quadratic + breit - wigner function to the invariant k@xmath1k@xmath1 mass ( @xmath19 ) distribution around this peak , where @xmath20 , we obtain a mass of @xmath21 mev/@xmath12 and width ( @xmath22 ) of @xmath23 mev/@xmath12 . comparing with the particle data group meson table",
    "@xcite , this peak is a good candidate for the @xmath24 meson",
    ". this would be the first observation of the decay of this meson into the k@xmath1k@xmath1 channel in @xmath0 collisions . in order to disentangle the non - flat baseline from the low-@xmath25 femtoscopic enhancement , pythia @xcite",
    "was used to model the baseline .",
    "both gaussian and quadratic fits were made to pythia - generated k@xmath1k@xmath1 correlation functions for each multiplicity-@xmath3 bin studied , and these fits were then used to define the baseline in fitting the femtoscopic function to the experimental correlation functions .",
    "pythia with the perugia-0 tune @xcite is found to describe reasonably well the dependence of the baseline shape of the k@xmath1k@xmath1 correlation function on multiplicity-@xmath3 bin in the @xmath25 fitting range used of 0 - 1 gev / c .",
    "using both the gaussian and quadratic pythia fits helped to define the systematic error of this approach , as well as adding to the systematic error estimate a @xmath26% uncertainty in the fit parameters due to the uncertainty in using pythia to estimate the baseline .",
    "k@xmath1 @xmath25 correlation function for all multiplicity and @xmath3.,width=238 ]    k@xmath1 @xmath25 correlation function for all multiplicity and @xmath3.,width=226 ]    k@xmath1k@xmath1 correlation functions in @xmath25 were formed from the data in 12 bins : 3 event multiplicity ( 1 - 11 , 12 - 22 , @xmath27 ) bins @xmath2 4 @xmath3 ( 0.4 - 0.8 , 0.8 - 1.1 , 1.1 - 1.4 , @xmath28 gev / c ) bins .",
    "the femtoscopic variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 were extracted in each bin by fitting the experimental correlation function divided by the pythia baseline shape by the lednicky parameterization @xcite based on the model by r. lednicky and v.l .",
    "lyuboshitz @xcite .",
    "this model takes into account both quantum statistics and strong final - state interactions from the @xmath6 resonance which occur between the k@xmath1k@xmath1 pair .",
    "the k@xmath1 spacial distribution is assumed to be gaussian with a width @xmath4 in the parameterization and so its influence on the correlation function is from both the quantum statistics and the strong final - state interaction .",
    "this is the same parameterization as was used by the rhic star collaboration to extract @xmath4 and @xmath5 from their k@xmath1k@xmath1 study of au - au collisions @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows a sample experimental k@xmath1k@xmath1 correlation function divided by the pythia quadratic baseline fit for the multiplicity 1 - 11 and @xmath3 0.4 - 0.8 gev / c bin .",
    "also shown are fits with the lednicky parameterization and for comparison a usual gaussian model .",
    "as seen , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 parameters from the lednicky fit are @xmath29% and @xmath30% smaller , respectively , than those extracted from the gaussian model fit .",
    "the rhic star experiment saw @xmath31% reductions in these parameters in au - au collisions compared with a gaussian model fit @xcite , the smaller effect being expected for a larger k@xmath1 source size since the strong final - state interactions are reduced in that case by geometry @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] present the results of this study for @xmath5 and @xmath4 parameters extracted by fitting the lednicky parameterization to the k@xmath1k@xmath1 correlation function in each of the 12 bins .",
    "statistical + systematic errors are shown .",
    "the largest contribution to the error bars in all cases is due to the @xmath26% systematic uncertainty applied to the pythia baseline fit parameters as discussed above .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath5 is seen in figure [ fig4 ] to be mostly flat with @xmath5 lying at an average level of @xmath32 , similar to that found in the alice @xmath7 results for 7 tev @xmath0 collisions @xcite .",
    "there is also a slight tendency seen for @xmath5 to be larger in the smaller multiplicity bins .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] plots @xmath4 vs. both @xmath3 and @xmath33 . also shown for comparison",
    "are @xmath4 parameters extracted in the same event multiplicity bins from a @xmath7 femtoscopic study by alice @xcite in 7 tev @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the k@xmath1k@xmath1 results for @xmath4 suggest a slight tendency for @xmath4 to decrease with increasing @xmath3 ( or @xmath33 ) and to increase for increasing event multiplicity bin as also seen in the alice @xmath7 results for 7 tev @xmath0 collisions and in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . comparing with @xmath7 , the k@xmath1k@xmath1 results for",
