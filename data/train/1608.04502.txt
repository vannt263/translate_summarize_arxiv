    "for any finite group @xmath0 and prime number @xmath1 , it is an interesting question to ask which ordinary irreducible representations of @xmath0 remain irreducible in characteristic @xmath1 .",
    "this question was answered some time ago for the symmetric groups @xcite , and more recently @xcite for the alternating groups . in this paper",
    "we address double covers of the symmetric groups ; since ( in all but finitely many cases ) these are schur covers , we implicitly also address the question of which projective representations of the symmetric groups remain irreducible in characteristic @xmath1 .",
    "we denote a chosen double cover of @xmath3 by @xmath4 ( though in fact our results apply equally well to the other double cover ) ; thus @xmath4 has a central involution @xmath5 such that @xmath6 . in any characteristic",
    "one can separate the irreducible representations of @xmath4 into `` linear '' representations ( on which @xmath5 acts trivially ) and `` spin '' representations ( on which @xmath5 acts as @xmath7 ) .",
    "the linear representations are also irreducible representations of @xmath3 , and so the answer to our main question for linear representations follows at once from the answer for symmetric groups .",
    "so we need only consider spin representations .",
    "in fact in this paper we prefer to work in the language of characters : the ordinary irreducible spin characters of @xmath4 are labelled by @xmath8-regular partitions of @xmath9 : there is a single character @xmath10 for every @xmath8-regular partition @xmath11 of @xmath9 with an even number of even parts , and a pair of associate characters @xmath12 for every @xmath11 with an odd number of even parts . in the latter case ,",
    "we write @xmath10 to mean `` either @xmath13 or @xmath14 '' , so our main question becomes `` for which @xmath11 is the @xmath1-modular reduction of @xmath10 irreducible ? '' .",
    "there has been a recent resurgence of interest in the representation theory of @xmath4 in odd characteristic .",
    "we hope to address this case in a future paper , but in the present paper we work instead in characteristic @xmath8 . apart from the fundamental paper @xcite of bessenrodt and olsson in 1997 from which we take some important results ) , this situation has been relatively neglected , but we hope that the present paper will spark a revival .",
    "note that in characteristic @xmath8 the central involution @xmath5 must act as @xmath15 on an irreducible representation , so there are no irreducible spin representations .",
    "so the irreducible brauer characters in characteristic @xmath8 are precisely those coming from @xmath3 , namely the characters @xmath16 of the `` james modules '' @xmath17 . thus the @xmath8-modular reduction of any ordinary irreducible spin character decomposes as a sum of characters @xmath16 .",
    "this means that the decomposition matrix of @xmath4 in characteristic @xmath8 consists of the decomposition matrix of @xmath3 extended downwards by a `` spin matrix '' with rows corresponding to ordinary irreducible spin characters .",
    "although this spin matrix can be computed fairly easily given the decomposition matrix of @xmath3 , it remains fairly mysterious in general .",
    "a key contribution in the present paper is to describe part of this matrix ( specifically , the part with rows labelled by @xmath8-regular partitions having no even parts greater than @xmath8 ) for rouquier blocks of @xmath4 .",
    "we now indicate the structure of the paper and of the proof of our main theorem .",
    "in [ backsec ] we set out the background information we shall need ; we try to provide enough information to make the paper reasonably self - contained , though we do make some effort at concision . in [ mainthmsec ]",
    "we recall the notion of a _ carter partition _ which enables us to state our main theorem . in [ degreesec ]",
    "we examine character degrees , which are an important ingredient in our proof .",
    "the key observation here is that if @xmath10 and @xmath18 are ordinary characters having a @xmath8-modular constituent in common , and if the degree of @xmath10 is greater than the degree of @xmath18 , then the @xmath8-modular reduction of @xmath10 can not be irreducible .",
    "it turns out that ( in contrast to the more famous hook - length formula for the degrees of linear characters ) the bar - length formula for spin characters allows us to compare degrees quite easily . in [ rouqandsep ]",
    "we consider spin characters lying in a `` rouquier '' block of @xmath4 .",
    "while rouquier blocks of symmetric groups have been studied extensively in the last few years , this appears to be the first time they have been considered for the double covers in characteristic @xmath8 . by constructing various projective characters and exploiting connections with symmetric functions ,",
    "we describe part of the decomposition matrix for a rouquier block .",
    "we then extend this beyond rouquier blocks to spin characters labelled by what we call _ separated _ partitions , and give a proof of our main theorem for separatedpartitions . in [ mainproofsec ] we complete the proof of our main theorem , by considering non - separatedpartitions .",
    "here we use an inductive proof ( similar in spirit to that used for the alternating groups in @xcite ) , based on kleshchev s modular branching rules . in [ futuresec ]",
    "we consider possibilities for future work , and in [ indexnotnsec ] we provide an index of notation .",
    "the research presented in this paper would not have been possible without extensive computations using gap @xcite .",
    "_ throughout this section @xmath19 is a fixed field of characteristic @xmath8 . _",
    "we let @xmath3 denote the symmetric group of degree @xmath9 , and @xmath20 its group algebra over @xmath19 .",
    "the representation theory of @xmath20 is well - studied , and in the last twenty years or so has become increasingly intertwined with the representation theory of a certain ( iwahori)hecke algebra .",
    "specifically , we let @xmath21 denote the iwahori  hecke algebra of @xmath3 over @xmath22 with quantum parameter @xmath7 ; this has generators @xmath23 , with defining relations @xmath24 for each @xmath25 , together with the braid relations @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29",
    ". then the representation theory of @xmath21 is closely related to the representation theory of @xmath20 : the canonical labelling sets for the specht modules and simple modules for these algebras are the same , and ( as we shall see ) there is a close relationship between their decomposition matrices .",
    "the main advantage of introducing @xmath21 into the subject is that its decomposition numbers are better understood than those of @xmath20 ( indeed , they can be computed using the _ llt algorithm _",
    "we shall exploit this later , although the relationship between the symmetric group and the hecke algebra does not extend well to double covers of @xmath3 .",
    "another important family of algebras in this area is the family of _ schur algebras _ introduced by green @xcite , and more generally the _",
    "@xmath30-schur algebras _ defined by dipper and james ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 2.9 ) .",
    "we just concentrate on two of these algebras , for each @xmath9 : let @xmath31 denote the classical schur algebra over @xmath19 ( which is @xmath32 in the notation of dipper  james ) , and let @xmath33 denote the @xmath30-schur algebra over @xmath22 with quantum parameter @xmath34 , i.e.  @xmath35 in the dipper  james notation .",
    "@xmath31 is related to @xmath20 via the _ schur functor _ , which shows in particular that the decomposition matrix of @xmath20 can be obtained from that of @xmath31 by deleting some of the columns .",
    "@xmath33 is related to @xmath21 is a similar way .",
    "as we shall see , the decomposition matrix of @xmath31 also appears in the adjustment matrices of rouquier blocks .",
    "now we consider double covers . in this paper",
    "we work with the group @xmath4 with generators @xmath36 , subject to relations @xmath37 then @xmath4 is a double cover of the symmetric group @xmath3 : the subgroup @xmath38 is central , and setting @xmath5 to @xmath15 in the above presentation yields the coxeter presentation of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath39 @xmath4 is a _ schur cover _ of @xmath3 .",
    "this means that linear representations of @xmath4 are equivalent to projective representations of @xmath3 , i.e.  homomorphisms from @xmath3 to @xmath40 for a vector space @xmath41 .",
    "thus our main theorem can be phrased in terms of projective representations . for @xmath42",
    ", @xmath3 is its own schur cover ( note that the final relation in the presentation above never occurs when @xmath42 , so that @xmath4 is just the direct product of @xmath3 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it makes sense to work with the group @xmath4 for all @xmath43 , and we do so in this paper to help with our induction proofs .",
    "we remark that for @xmath39 there is an alternative schur cover obtained by replacing the relation @xmath44 with @xmath45 ; this is isomorphic to @xmath4 only when @xmath46 , but in general is isoclinic to @xmath4 , and so from our point of view its representation theory is the same .",
    "now we consider the different types of irreducible representations of @xmath4 . in an irreducible representation of @xmath4 over any field ,",
    "the central element @xmath5 must act as @xmath15 or @xmath7 .",
    "irreducible representations in which @xmath5 acts as @xmath15 correspond exactly to irreducible representations of @xmath3 , and we refer to these as _ linear _ representations . studying linear representations of @xmath4",
    "is equivalent to studying representations of @xmath3 , so in this paper we shall be chiefly concerned with the representations where @xmath5 acts as @xmath7 , which we call _ spin _ representations .    for an introduction to the representation theory of @xmath4",
    ", we refer the reader to the book by hoffman and humphreys @xcite .",
    "the representations of the symmetric groups and their double covers are conventionally labelled by partitions . in this paper ,",
    "partition _ is an infinite weakly decreasing sequence @xmath47 of non - negative integers with finite sum , which we denote @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath49 , then we say that @xmath11 is a partition of @xmath9 .",
    "the integers @xmath50 are called the _ parts _ of @xmath11 . when writing partitions , we conventionally omit the trailing zeroes and group together equal parts with a superscript ( so that we write the partition @xmath51 as @xmath52 ) , and we write the unique partition of @xmath53 as @xmath54 .",
    "a partition is _",
    "@xmath8-regular _ if it does not have two equal non - zero parts , and _",
    "@xmath8-singular _ otherwise .",

    "@xmath63 ( and writing @xmath64 ) if @xmath65 for all @xmath66 .",
    "the _ young diagram _ of a partition @xmath11 is the set @xmath67 we often identify a partition with its young diagram ; for example , we may write @xmath68 to mean that @xmath69 for all @xmath25 . the elements of the young diagram of @xmath11 are called the _ nodes _ of @xmath11 .",

    "in addition , [ unitriang ] holds with @xmath137 replaced by @xmath139 .",
    "furthermore , the decomposition numbers @xmath126 and @xmath138 are related by the theory of adjustment matrices : if we fix @xmath9 and let @xmath137 denote the decomposition matrix of @xmath31 and @xmath139 the decomposition matrix of @xmath33 , then the square matrix @xmath140 defined by @xmath141 is called the _ adjustment matrix _ for @xmath31 .",

    "now we come to double covers . here",
    "( and for the rest of the paper ) we work with characters , rather than modules .",
    "this is because we do not have particularly nice constructions of the modules affording the irreducible characters of double covers , and because statements about the decomposition of projective modules are more readily expressed in terms of projective characters . since we are only concerned with composition factors and not with module structures , there is no loss in working with characters .    with this in mind , we introduce notation for the characters of the @xmath3-modules described above : let @xmath143 denote the character of the specht module @xmath117 over @xmath22 , so that @xmath144 is the set of ordinary irreducible characters of @xmath3 . for @xmath119 ,",
    "let @xmath145 denote the @xmath8-modular brauer character of the james module @xmath120 .",
    "since @xmath3 is a quotient of @xmath4 , the characters @xmath143 , @xmath145 naturally become characters of @xmath4 , and we shall always view them in this way . note that in characteristic @xmath8 , the central element @xmath5 lies in the kernel of any irreducible representation of @xmath4 , so the irreducible representations of @xmath4 are precisely those arising from the irreducible representations of @xmath3 .",
    "thus the brauer characters @xmath145 for @xmath119 are all of the irreducible @xmath8-modular brauer characters of @xmath4 .",
    "now we look at spin characters . for each @xmath119 , let @xmath146 denote the number of positive even parts of @xmath11 , and write @xmath147 then for each @xmath148 , there is an irreducible spin character @xmath10 of @xmath4 , while for each @xmath149 , there are two irreducible spin characters @xmath13 and @xmath14 of @xmath4 .",
    "the definition of these characters goes back to schur , who showed that they are all the irreducible spin characters of @xmath4 .",
    "a uniform construction of irreducible representations affording these characters was given much later , by nazarov @xcite .",
    "we do not give the representations or their characters explicitly in this paper ; the properties we need will be summarised in later sections .    in fact , for @xmath149 the characters @xmath13 and @xmath14 behave very similarly : their values differ only up to sign , and in particular their degrees are the same and their @xmath8-modular reductions are the same .",
    "so to make things simpler in this paper we adopt the convention that we write @xmath10 to mean `` either @xmath13 or @xmath14 '' when @xmath149 .",
    "we also follow the usual convention of omitting brackets from a partition when using the notation @xmath150 or @xmath151 ; thus we may write @xmath152 instead of @xmath153 .",
    "we remark that historically the spin characters have been denoted @xmath154 or @xmath155 ; we use slightly different notation here because the brackets @xmath156 are already used for two other purposes in this paper .",

    "the integers @xmath126 and @xmath165 together constitute the decomposition matrix of @xmath4 in characteristic @xmath8 .",
    "the decomposition matrix of @xmath166 in characteristic @xmath8 is as follows .",
    "the top part of the matrix is the decomposition matrix of @xmath167 , with the @xmath168-entry being @xmath126 .",
    "the lower part gives the decomposition numbers for spin characters , with entries @xmath165 ; note that for @xmath169 there are identical rows corresponding to @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "( in all matrices given explicitly in this paper , we use a dot to mean @xmath53 . )",
    "@xmath170    this example shows an interesting feature of the answer to our main question : we can re - cast our main question and ask `` which irreducible brauer characters arise as the @xmath8-modular reductions of ordinary irreducible characters ? '' . in this case",
    "we see that the brauer character @xmath171 does not arise as @xmath172 for any @xmath11 , but does arise as @xmath173 .",
    "so introducing spin characters can provide constructions of irreducible brauer characters which might otherwise be hard to obtain .    a central result in modular representation theory ( which we shall use without comment )",
    "is brauer reciprocity , which gives a connection between decomposition numbers and indecomposable projective characters . given @xmath133 , the projective cover of the james module @xmath17",

    "now we state some results which we shall need later concerning the inverses of the matrices @xmath137 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "we say that two characters of @xmath1015 are _ conjugate _ if we can transform one into the other by conjugating all elements of @xmath1015 by an odd element of @xmath4 .",
    "the ordinary irreducible spin characters of @xmath1015 are easily constructed from those for @xmath4 : for every @xmath148 the restriction @xmath1018 is a sum of two conjugate irreducible characters @xmath12 , while for @xmath149 the restriction @xmath1019 is a self - conjugate irreducible character which we denote @xmath10 . the set @xmath1020 is a complete set ( without repeats ) of ordinary irreducible spin characters of @xmath1015 . to help us to determine which of these characters remain irreducible in characteristic @xmath8 , we consider restricting from @xmath4 , using the fact that restriction to subgroups commutes with modular reduction .",
    "_ we now no longer allow ourselves to write @xmath10 to mean `` either @xmath13 or @xmath14 '' when @xmath149 .",
    "_ so @xmath10 for @xmath149 will unambiguously mean the spin character for @xmath1015 labelled by @xmath11 .    as with @xmath4 , there are no irreducible spin characters of @xmath1015 in characteristic @xmath8 , so the irreducible @xmath8-modular characters of @xmath1015 are the same as those for @xmath1014 .",
    "these are also constructed by restriction from @xmath3 , but to explain the situation here we need a definition : say that @xmath197 is an _ s - partition _ if for every odd @xmath201 the @xmath201th ladder of @xmath11 contains an even number of nodes .",
    "then @xmath1021 is a sum of two conjugate irreducible characters @xmath1022 if @xmath11 is an s - partition , and otherwise @xmath1021 is a self - conjugate irreducible character .",
    "the irreducible characters arising in this way are ( without repeats ) all the irreducible @xmath8-modular characters of @xmath1014 .",
    "this result is due to benson ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) , though the as far as we are aware the characterisation of s - partitions we have given is new .",
    "now we consider what happens when we take an ordinary irreducible spin character of @xmath4 , restrict to @xmath1015 and reduce modulo @xmath8 .",
    "take @xmath149 .",
    "then the fact that restriction commutes with modular reduction gives @xmath1023 so in order for @xmath216 to be irreducible , @xmath1024 must be irreducible , and must remain irreducible on restriction to @xmath1015 . by [ spinreg ] , this means that @xmath1025 , and that @xmath213 is not an s - partition .",
    "in fact , the second condition is automatic : it is an easy exercise that an s - partition must have even @xmath8-weight , whereas all the partitions in [ main ] that lie in @xmath1026 have odd @xmath237-bar - weight .",
    "so for @xmath1027 we conclude that @xmath216 is irreducible @xmath1024 is , i.e.  @xmath11 is one of the partitions appearing in [ main ] .",
    "now consider @xmath148 . in this case",
    "restricting and reducing modulo @xmath8 gives @xmath1028 since @xmath13 and @xmath14 are conjugate characters , @xmath1024 is irreducible @xmath1029 is , and this happens @xmath1030 has exactly two irreducible constituents . hence either    * @xmath216 is irreducible , or * @xmath216 has exactly two irreducible constituents , which restrict to conjugate irreducible @xmath8-modular characters of @xmath1014 .",
    "the main theorem of the present paper tells us exactly when the first situation occurs . for the second situation to occur",
    ", the two irreducible constituents of @xmath216 would have to be equal in order for their restrictions to @xmath1015 to be conjugate and irreducible , so by [ spinreg ] we would have to have @xmath1031 . in particular , this implies that @xmath146 would have to be @xmath8 .",
    "so to solve the main problem for spin characters of @xmath1015 , it remains to classify partitions @xmath197 with exactly two non - zero even parts , such that @xmath1031 .",
    "such partitions do occur ; the first example is @xmath1032 , and we will see a family of examples below .",
    "one of the main results in this paper ( [ allodd , allodd2 ] ) is the calculation of part of the decomposition matrix for a rouquier block of @xmath4 ; specifically , the rows corresponding to @xmath8-regular partitionswith no even parts greater than @xmath8",
    ". it would be interesting to extend this to determine the whole of the decomposition matrix for a rouquier block .",
    "we expect this would be amenable to the same techniques , once suitable combinatorial expressions for the entries are found .    by way of example",
    ", we consider the spin part of the decomposition matrix for a rouquier block of weight @xmath1033 .",
    "let @xmath236 be a @xmath8-core of length at least @xmath1034 and @xmath242 the corresponding @xmath237-bar - core , and let @xmath230 be the block with core @xmath236 and weight @xmath1033 .",
    "then we write @xmath694 for the spin part of the decomposition matrix of @xmath230 ; we label the columns of @xmath694 by partitions of @xmath1033 , and the rows by pairs @xmath1035 of partitions with @xmath532 @xmath8-regular and @xmath1036 , and set @xmath1037 we also define @xmath140 to be the adjustment matrix for @xmath1038 .",
    "the matrices @xmath694 and @xmath717 are given in [ eav ] .",
    "@xmath1039    @xmath1040    note that the submatrix consisting of the first three rows of @xmath717 is the matrix @xmath740 from [ somedecoddsec ] , in agreement with [ allodd2 ] .",
    "we leave the reader to try to work out the pattern in the rest of this matrix .",
    "we can not even see why the entries of @xmath717 are necessarily non - negative !",
    "another point to observe in the matrix @xmath694 is the sixth row , which shows a spin character whose @xmath8-modular reduction just has two equal composition factors .",
    "this is relevant to the discussion of the double cover of the alternating group in [ ansec ] : it shows that if @xmath11 is one of @xmath1041 then the ordinary spin characters of @xmath1015 labelled by @xmath11 remain irreducible in characteristic @xmath8 .",
    "for the reader s convenience we conclude with an index of the notation we use in this paper .",
