    "<S> a decode and forward protocol based trellis coded modulation ( tcm ) scheme for the half - duplex relay channel , in a rayleigh fading environment , is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed scheme can achieve any spectral efficiency greater than or equal to one bit per channel use ( bpcu ) . </S>",
    "<S> a near - ml decoder for the suggested tcm scheme is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the high snr performance of this near - ml decoder approaches the performance of the optimal ml decoder . </S>",
    "<S> the high snr performance of this near - ml decoder is independent of the strength of the source - relay link and approaches the performance of the optimal ml decoder with an ideal source - relay link . </S>",
    "<S> based on the derived pair - wise error probability ( pep ) bounds , design criteria to maximize the diversity and coding gains are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results show a large gain in snr for the proposed tcm scheme over uncoded communication as well as the direct transmission without the relay . </S>",
    "<S> also , it is shown that even for the uncoded transmission scheme , the choice of the labelling scheme ( mapping from bits to complex symbols ) used at the source and the relay significantly impacts the ber vs snr performance . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a good labelling scheme for @xmath0-psk signal set , where @xmath1 is an integer . </S>"
