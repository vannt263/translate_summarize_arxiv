    ", however , luminous extragalactic maser emission has been detected also from the @xmath0 transition of 2o ( rest frequency : 183.310ghz ) in the starburst galaxy ngc  3079 ( humphreys et al .",
    "2005 ) and in the ultra - luminous infrared oh megamaser galaxy arp  220 ( cernicharo et al .  2006 ) . ] and oh emission , the ` megamasers ' ( with isotropic luminosities @xmath1@xmath210l@xmath3 ) , are known to arise from the highly obscured inner parsecs of galaxies which host an active nucleus ( agn ) or from the dense interstellar medium of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "interferometric studies of such 2o  masers provide the only known probe to map molecular tori and accretion disks and to study their geometry and thickness ( e.g. miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) , while oh can trace more extended structures in merging spirals ( e.g. klckner et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "2o  and oh masers can also be associated with star forming regions and oxygen - rich late - type stars , but in these cases their luminosities are much weaker than those of the megamasers .",
    "the most extreme case with ` weaker ' 2o  emission known to date , the starburst spiral galaxy ngc  2146 , shows two clusters of 2o  masers , each with a luminosity of @xmath41l@xmath5 and a total single - dish luminosity of @xmath48l@xmath5 , presumably all related to massive star formation ( tarchi et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "although the two most prominent extragalactic maser species , 2o  and oh , are associated with similar objects , a coincidence in the same object has only been found in m  82 , ngc  3079 , and ngc  4945 , and has never involved particularly luminous maser sources from both molecular species . hence , except for these galaxies , 2o  and oh emission seem to be mutually exclusive",
    "this is likely a consequence of the diverse excitation and pumping conditions of the respective lines .",
    "oh maser emission , excited mostly radiatively and requiring comparatively low density gas , is more extended and farther off the excitation source than the water masers that are likely collisionally excited and require higher temperature and density . as described in the following , we may have found a first target where megamaser from both species are detected .",
    "the extremely luminous infrared galaxy arp  299 ( mkn  171 ) to the northwest . here",
    "we follow the more traditional nomenclature that is commonly used in the literature . ]",
    "is a merging system located at a distance of @xmath442mpc .",
    "it is composed of four main regions of activity : the two galaxies ic  694 ( * a * ) and ngc  3690 ( * b * ; resolved at infrared and radio wavelengths into two components , * b1 * and * b2 * ) , and two individual concentrations ( * c * and * c@xmath6 * ) at the interface where ic  694 and ngc  3690 overlap ( e.g. neff et al .  2004 ; fig .",

    "the system is rich in molecular gas ( casoli et al .",
    "1999 ) and displays oh megamaser activity with an isotropic luminosity of @xmath4 240 ( baan 1985 ) apparently tracing a rotating disk in ic  694 ( baan & haschick 1990 ; hereafter bh90 ) .",
    "the presence of such a flattened rotating structure in ic  694 was subsequently also invoked by polatidis & aalto ( 2001 ) to explain its atomic ( ) and molecular ( co ) gas velocity distribution . in march 2002",
    ", strong water megamaser emission was detected in the merging system arp 299 , with a total isotropic luminosity of @xmath4 200 l@xmath5 ( henkel et al .",
    "water vapor in arp  299 was observed on september 19 , 2004 , with the very large array ( vla ) in its a configuration and a frequency setup with two 25 mhz intermediate frequency bands ( `` ifs '' ) centered at local standard of rest velocities of @xmath7 = 2900 and 3200 .",
    "the ifs were overlapped in frequency in order to minimize the effect of band - edge roll - off .",
    "each if covered @xmath4 340 @xmath8 with a resolution of @xmath4 20 @xmath8 .",
    "the data were fourier - transformed using natural weighting to create a data cube .",
    "a radio continuum map was produced using the line - free channels .",
    "the restoring beam was 01 @xmath9 01 and the rms noise was 0.5 mjy / beam / chan and 0.1 mjy / beam for the cube and the continuum maps , respectively .",
    "the noise was higher than the expected thermal noise , likely because of poor weather during the observations .",

    ", the feature has an isotropic luminosity of 25 .",

    ", the arp  299 complex was investigated in a search for a signature of agn activity in the central regions of ngc  3690 and ic  694 . while the presence of highly - absorbed but intrinsically strong x  ray emission was detected in arp  299 at e @xmath2 10 kev ( della ceca et al .",
    "2002 ) suggesting the presence of a luminous buried agn , the spatial resolution was not good enough to determine the location of the putative agn within arp  299 .",
    "more recent higher spatial resolution x  ray data strongly support the presence of a buried agn in the mid - infrared peak b1 of ngc  3690 ( zezas et al .  2003 ; ballo et al .  2004 ) .",
    "the association of the component b1 with the true ( active ) nucleus of ngc  3690 , has been supported further using mid - infrared ( gallais et al .",
    "2004 ) and optical ( garcia - marin et al .",
    "2006 ) spectroscopy . within this framework , our detection of a megamaser (",
    "although weaker than the single - dish detection , see next section ) coincident in position with the spot b1 constitutes an additional proof of the presence of an agn in ngc  3690 .",
    "the velocity of the maser line is also consistent with that of the molecular gas ( co ) in ngc  3690 , when taking into account the complexity of the velocity field of the system ( casoli et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "a less straightforward scenario is instead offered by the detection of maser emission within 01 ( @xmath4 20 pc ) of the nucleus of ic  694 .",
    "the presence of a second active nucleus in the interacting system arp  299 is still under discussion .",
    "all the observations ( radio , infrared , and x - rays ) offer an ambiguous interpretation that allows to support either the agn nature of the nucleus of ic  694 ( e.g. ballo et al .",
    "2004 ) or the presence of a deeply embedded nuclear starburst ( e.g. gallais et al .  2004 ) .",
    "the presence of an oh megamaser has been interpreted as due to low - gain amplification of a diffuse underlying background continuum structure possibly constituted by a nuclear starburst ( bh90 ) .",
    "the isotropic luminosity of the water maser feature detected by us is just above the 10  threshold conventionally used to discriminate between the more luminous megamasers ( typically indicative of agn ) and the weaker kilomasers ( mostly associated with enhanced star formation activity ) , and hence , it can not be confidently used to discriminate between the two scenarios .",
    "the velocity of the 2o  maser line can , however , be used to obtain a clearer picture .",
    "the maser velocity is blueshifted by @xmath4 100  w.r.t .",
    "the optical estimate of the systemic velocity of ic  694 ( v@xmath18 = 3100  3110 ; bh90 and references therein ) .",
    "co , and oh emission detected in ic  694 show also components with velocities smaller than the systemic one and are consistent with that of the maser line ( casoli et al .  1999 ; bh90 ) .",
    "bh90 suggested that the blueshifted  and oh gas is part of an expanding structure in the foreground of the nucleus of ic  694 .",
    "the expanding structure could be made up from material swept up by an episode of nuclear activity , possibly representing a nuclear ( agn or starburst driven ) outflow .",
    "the association of luminous water maser emission with an ( agn ) outflow has been so far reported only for the circinus galaxy ( greenhill et al .",
    "2003 ) , and hence , if confirmed , our finding might represent a second important case that needs , in our opinion , to be investigated in more detail .",
    "it is remarkable that ic  694 represents the first case where strong 2o  and oh maser emission have been detected in the same galaxy .",
    "the maser features detected with the vla in ngc  3690 and ic  694 have velocities consistent with that of the ( broader ) feature observed with effelsberg in 2002 .",
    "the flux density peak is , however , significantly degraded ( from 25 to 4 mjy / beam ) w.r.t .",
    "the effelsberg spectra ( see henkel et al .",
    "2005 ; their fig .  6 ) .",
    "this fact is readily explained in two ways :    * since variability is a common phenomenon among maser lines , the flux loss could be just an intrinsic dimming . to test this option ,",
    "we have compared the vla spectra with two more recent ( november 2005 ) effelsberg observations pointed toward the two nuclei of the galaxies in arp  299 ( fig .",
    "[ comp ] ) . as before",
    ", the single - dish lines are much stronger than those measured by the vla and do not support strong variability .",
    "* the maser emission may consist of compact hotspots spread over a wide area and the two features detected may represent only the strongest centers of emission ( see sect .  1 for a similar situation in ngc  2146 ) . vla 22  ghz high - sensitivity observations with angular resolutions of 13 arcseconds have been requested to study this possibility and to locate a larger fraction of the total h@xmath19o flux .",
    "we have mapped the 22  ghz water vapor maser emission in arp  299 with the vla in its most extended configuration .",
    "our preliminary analysis indicates that two maser spots are associated with the nuclear regions of ngc  3690 and ic  694 .",
    "another tentatively detected weaker spot is possibly associated with the overlapping region . given these results ,",
    "we conclude that : 1 ) the presence of an agn in ngc  3690 is confirmed ; 2 ) ic  694 represents the first case where luminous 2o  and oh masers are coexisting ; 3 ) the velocity of the maser line in ic  694 is blueshifted w.r.t .",
    "the systemic velocity of the galaxy indicating an association with an expanding structure previously seen in  and oh ; 4 ) our results on ic  694 are not incompatible with the presence of a second agn in arp  299      at wishes to thank willem baan and susanne aalto for useful discussions .",
