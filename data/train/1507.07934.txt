    "the nature of the dark matter halos hosting quasars remain debatable .",
    "there are primarily two competing models .",
    "one is the traditional , popular hod ( halo occupation distribution ) model , which is based on assigning a probability function to quasars to reside in a halo of a given mass in order to match the observed quasar clustering strength @xcite .",
    "the other model is a physically motivated model recently put forth ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cs model hereafter ) .    while the cs model , like the hod based model , matches the observed clustering of quasars , the masses of the dark matter halos in the cs model are very different from those of the hod based model .",
    "for example , at @xmath5 , the host halos in the cs model have masses of @xmath6 , compared to @xmath7 in the hod model .",
    "this then offers a critical differentiator between the cs and hod models , namely , the cold gas content in quasars host galaxies . specifically , because of the large halos mass required in the hod model , quasars hosts have much lower content of cold gas than in the cs model .",
    "@xcite have shown that the cs model is in excellent with the observed covering fraction of @xmath8 for lyman limit systems within the virial radius of @xmath9 quasars @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the hod model is inconsistent with observations of the high covering fraction of lyman limit systems in quasar host galaxies .",
    "given the fundamental importance of the nature of dark matter halos hosting quasars , in this _",
    "we present another potentially powerful test to distinguish between these two competing models .",
    "we show that upcoming measurements of thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect at arc - minute resolution ( or better ) should be able to differentiate between them with high confidence .",
    "we utilize the _ millennium simulation _ @xcite to perform the analysis .",
    "a set of properties of this simulation that meet our requirements includes a large box of @xmath10mpc , a relatively good mass resolution with dark matter particles of mass @xmath11 , and a spatial resolution of 5 @xmath12 comoving .",
    "the mass and spatial resolutions are adequate for capturing halos of masses greater than @xmath13 , which are resolved by at least about 100 particles and 40 spatial resolution elements for the virial diameter .",
    "dark matter haloes are found through a _ friends - of - friends _ ( fof ) algorithm .",
    "satellite halos orbiting within each virialized halo are identified applying a subfind algorithm @xcite .",
    "the adopted @xmath14 cosmology parameters are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the hubble constant is @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "we do not expect that our results strongly depend on the choice of cosmological parameters within reasonable ranges , such as those from @xcite .",
    "the steps taken to construct the tsz maps are as follow . for each model ( either cs or hod ) quasar model",
    ", we sample the quasar host dark matter halos at each redshift , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for each quasar host , we select all halos within a projected radius of 80 arcmin centered at the quasar in a cylinder with the depth equal to the length of the simulation box in a given direction . the thermal energy of a halo of mass @xmath25 is calculated using @xmath26 where @xmath25 is the halo mass and @xmath27 the 1-d velocity dispersion computed as @xmath28^{1/6 } ( 1+z)^{1/2 } } { \\rm [ km / s]}.\\ ] ] the energy of each halo is then distributed uniformly in projected area inside its virial radius @xmath29 . to construct sz maps , we project the energy of each halo using a cloud - in - cell technique in 2-d .",
    "we obtain the compton - y parameter corresponding to total projected thermal energy @xmath30 at each pixel with : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the area of the pixel , @xmath33 the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath34 the electron mass , @xmath35 the speed of light , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 accounts for electron density to mass density , and molecular weight , respectively .",
    "we limit the dark matter halos that contribute to the @xmath38 calculation to the mass range @xmath39\\msun$ ] at @xmath22 and @xmath40\\msun$ ] at both @xmath41 and @xmath24 .",
    "the upper mass limits is used in order to enable comparisons to observations , accounting for the fact that in the planck observation generated @xmath38 maps the clusters more massive than these indicated upper limits are masked out @xcite .",
    "the lower mass limits reflect the fact that less massive halos would be cold stream dominated instead of virial shock heated gas dominated ; changing the lower mass limit from @xmath42 to @xmath43 only slightly increases the computed y parameter .    to enable comparison with the observed compton - y maps stacked over a range of redshift @xmath44 with median redshift of @xmath45 @xcite , we appropriately assign weightings of ( 36% , 51% , 13% ) for @xmath46 maps , respectively , and sum up the contributions from the three redshifts .",
    "these weightings are adopted to mimic the redshift distribution of stacked quasars used in the observational anaylysis .",
    "to compute the variance of the y - parameter we make nine maps each averaged over 1/9th of total individual compton - y maps of the quasar hosts at each redshift for either of the hod or cs models .",
    "then we have @xmath47 possible final maps constructed with the weightings defined above .",
    "the dispersion and the mean is then computed considering these 729 final maps .",
    "in addition , we construct isolated quasar host only @xmath38 maps , with only the quasar host halo s energy contributing to the final tsz map .",
    "in other words , in those isolated quasar y maps , we exclude effects from projected , clustered neighboring halos .",
    "-0.0 cm -0.0 cm    we first validate the quasar models by comparing them to planck observations . figure  [ fig : maps ] shows compton - y maps for five randomly selected quasar maps at @xmath41 ( including the projection effects ) in the five panels other than the top - left panel and the averaged over 10,000 such individual maps is shown in the top - left panel .",
    "each individual map is centered on the quasar halo from the cs model .",
    "halos that contribute to the signal are in the mass range we describe above and in some cases the quasar halo itself does not contribute to the signal if its mass fall outside the mass range .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : planck ] shows the compton - y radial profile obtained by sampling for cs ( blue shaded region ) and hod ( purple shaded region ) model , respectively .",
    "overplotted is the result obtained by stacking the planck tsz maps for quasars in the redshift range @xmath48 with median redshift of 1.5 ( green shaded region , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to compare with planck tsz maps , we smooth our synthetic maps with a beam of fwhm=@xmath2  arcmin",
    "we see that , at the resolution of planck of fwhm=@xmath2  arcmin , both cs and hod model are consistent with the observed level of tsz being contributed entirely by shocked heated , virialized gas within massive halos .",
    "given our generous mass limit of contributing halos and neglect of gravitationally shock heated gas outside the virial radius , it is likely that the estimates for cs and hod models shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : planck ] are somewhat under - estimated .",
    "thus , in disagreement with @xcite with respect to feedback energy from other non - gravitational sources , we see little evidence for a need of a large contribution to the tsz from non - gravitational energy sources , including quasars or stars .    to better understand this discrepancy",
    ", we show in right panel of figure  [ fig : planck ] the compton - y profile in hod model , when only the quasar - hosting halo contributes to the thermal energy in the map , neglecting the contribution from clustered neighboring halos .",
    "we see that the isolated quasar map yields a tsz signal peaked around @xmath49 ( black curve with shaded area ) versus @xmath50 as seen in the left panel where all neighboring halos are included .",
    "it is hence very clear that the overall compton - y parameter reflects the collective thermal energy contribution of halos clustered around the quasar hosting halos in both cs and hod models .",
    "the collective effect exceeds that of the quasar host halo by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "we attribute the suggested need of additional quasar feedback energy in order to account for the observed tsz effect proposed by @xcite to the fact that projection effects due to clustered halos are not taken into account in their analysis . in right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : planck ] we also show the mean tsz signals for quasars at three different redshifts separately .",
    "since in this case no projected structures are included , the results are commensurate with the quasar halo masses in the models that increase with increasing redshift .",
    "in the ( hod , cs ) model @xcite , the lower mass threshold of quasar hosts is @xmath51\\msun$ ] at @xmath52 , @xmath53\\msun$ ] at @xmath41 and @xmath54\\msun$ ] at @xmath22 .",
    "it is also worth noting that , in the absence of projection effects , the quasar tsz signal in the cs model is about a factor of 5 ( at @xmath52 ) to 25 ( at @xmath22 ) lower than in the hod model , due to differences in the quasar host halo masses in the two models .",
    "-0.0 cm -0.4 cm -0.6 cm -0.65 cm -0.0 cm    it should be made clear that the projection effects are present at all redshifts . in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : planck ]",
    "we show the average compton - y profile per quasar for the cs ( solid curves ) and hod ( dashed curves ) model separately at @xmath22 ( blue ) , @xmath41 ( green ) and @xmath52 ( red ) , including projection effects .",
    "two trends are seen and fully understandable .",
    "first , overall , the tsz signal per quasar , with projected structures , increases with decreasing redshfit , in the range from @xmath22 to @xmath52 .",
    "this is expected due to continued growth of cosmic structure with time .",
    "we note that , if we had not removed the most massive clusters in our tsz maps ( to account for the masking - out of massive clusters in planck maps @xcite , the increase with decreasing redshift would be stronger .",
    "second , the ratio of tsz signal with projection effects to that without projection effects increases strongly with decreasing redshift , due to the combined effect of decreasing quasar host halo mass and increasing clustering around massive halos with decreasing redshift .    in the left panel of figure  [ fig : planck ]",
    "the observed y - map values are not dust - corrected . the correction amplitude for dust effect with the procedure used by @xcite , by applying the channel weights from the @xcite y - map construction to dust - like ( modified blackbody ) spectra , depends sensitively on dust temperature assumed .",
    "greco & hill ( 2015 , private communications ) show that for a dust temperature of @xmath55k used in @xcite , the y - map response is indeed negative over the entire redshift range of the quasar sample , resulting in an increase in total thermal energy in the y - map by about @xmath56 ; for lower dust temperatures , the y - map response becomes less negative and could go positive below some temperature for all redshifts ; for dust temperature of @xmath57k , the y - map response is very slightly negative at @xmath58 but significantly positive at @xmath59 , with the net y - map response for the quasar sample slightly positive . with regard to dust temperature , observational evidence is varied but data suggesting lower temperatures are widespread .",
    "for example , @xcite indicate dust temperature of @xmath60k in our own galaxy ; @xcite suggest a dust temperature of @xmath61k for dust around galaxies from far - infrared image stacking analysis ; @xcite suggest an overall dust temperature of @xmath57k in modeling the cosmic infrared background .",
    "thus , the contribution of dust emission itself to y - map depends significantly on the dust temperature and the exact temperature of dust is uncertain at best and the actual y - map response is thus uncertain . even if we take the dust - corrected y - map from @xcite , given our results that the dust - uncorrected y values can be explained soley by gravitational energy of halos hosting qsos and neighboring ones , the qso contribution is at most about @xmath62 of what is inferred in @xcite .",
    "having validated both the cs and hod models by the planck tsz data on 10  arcmin scales in the previous section , here we propose a test to differentiate between them .",
    "figure  [ fig : actmaps ] shows the stacked tsz map of quasars with a median redshift of @xmath1 smoothed with fwhm=@xmath4  arcmin in the cs ( left panel ) and hod ( right panel ) model .",
    "the difference between the two model is visually striking : the hod model , being hosted by much more massive halos than the cs model , displays a much more peaked tsz profile at the arcmin scales .",
    "the reason is that one arcmin corresponds to 516 kpc at @xmath63 , indicating that individual quasar hosting halos of mass @xmath64 in the hod model are no longer significantly smoothed out by a @xmath4 arcmin beam .",
    "the quasar hosting halos in the cs model , on the other hand , have much lower masses than those in the hod model and hence have much lower tsz effect at the arcmin scale . at the arcmin scale , projection effects",
    "are much reduced compared to the @xmath2 arcmin scale .",
    "-0.0 cm -1.0 cm -1.0 cm -0.0 cm    figure  [ fig : act ] quantifies what is seen in figure  [ fig : actmaps ] for the two quasar models .",
    "we see that , with fwhm=@xmath4 arcmin , the central value of @xmath38 parameter differs by a factor of about two in the two models : @xmath65 in the hod model versus @xmath66 in the cs model .",
    "this is a large difference and can be easily tested .",
    "-0.0 cm -0.0 cm",
    "-0.0 cm -0.0 cm    before quantifying how the two models may be differentiated , it is useful to understand the distribution of contributions from individual y maps to the averaged y map . figure  [ fig : hist ] shows the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of y parameter of the central region of radius @xmath4  arcmin of 10,000 individual quasar hosting halos ( including projection effects ) smoothed with fwhm=@xmath4 arcmin ( red histogram ) and smoothed with fwhm=@xmath2 arcmin ( blue histogram ) .",
    "it is evident that the distribution of @xmath67 in both cases is close to gaussian hence the distribution of y is approximately lognormal .",
    "this indicates that the overall contribution to the stacked maps is skewed to the high end of the y distribution .",
    "we find that 7.8% , 12.1% and 22.5% of high @xmath38",
    "quasar halos contribute to @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the overall @xmath38 value in the case with fwhm@xmath71arcmin , 6.3% , 9.6% and 18.4% in the case with fwhm@xmath72arcmin . given the non - gaussian nature",
    ", we use bootstrap to estimate errors on the mean y value .",
    "we find that the fractional error on the mean , computed by bootstrap sampling from our 10,000 samples , is 3.7% and 3.2% for fwhm=10 arcmin and 1 arcmin cases , respectively .",
    "thus , with a sample of @xmath73 quasars as in @xcite , the fractional error on the mean would be 2% for fwhm=1 arcmin case . since the fractional difference between the hod ( @xmath74 ) and the cs ( @xmath75 is 60% , this means that the hod and cs model can be distinguished at @xmath76 level , _ if statistical uncertainties are the only uncertainties_. it is thus likely that the significance level of differentiating the two models using arcmin scale tsz effect around quasars will be limited by systematic uncertainties .     as stated in",
    " 3 , there is a possibility that a significant fraction ( @xmath3 ) of the observed thermal energy based on y - maps may be due to non - gravitational heating , such as quasar feedback suggested by @xcite . under the reasonable assumption that the energy from quasar feedback accumulates over time ,",
    "say via episodic high - energy radio jets , the quasar feedback energy would be proportional to the galaxy stellar mass or approximately the halo mass , given the observed correlation between supermassive black hole mass and the bulge stellar mass or velocity dispersion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we further assume that the radial profile of the deposited energy from quasar feedback is the same as that of thermal energy sourced by gravitational energy , it follows then that the central y - value of the ( hod , cs ) model would be boosted from [ @xmath65 , @xmath66 ] shown in figure  [ fig : act ] to [ @xmath78 , @xmath79 . with the inclusion of this systematic uncertainty on quasar feedback energy ,",
    "the expected central y - value ranges would become [ @xmath80 , @xmath81 , respectively , for the ( hod , cs ) model , which remain strongly testable with arcmin resolution tsz observations .",
    "we perform a statistical analysis of stacked @xmath38 maps of quasar hosts using _",
    "millennium simulation_. two significant findings may be summarized .",
    "first , at the available resolution of fwhm=@xmath2 arcmin obtained by planck data , the observed tsz effect can be entirely accounted for and explained by thermal energy of halos sourced by gravitational collapse .",
    "no additional energy source is required at this conjunction .",
    "it must be noted that at fwhm=@xmath2 arcmin projection effects are important with contribution to @xmath38 parameter by clustered halos with the @xmath82 arcmin scale dominating over the host halos themselves by an order of magnitude .",
    "considering uncertainties of dust temperature in the calibration of observed y - maps , the maximum quasar feedback energy is about 25% of that suggested @xcite .",
    "second , we show that , at fwhm=@xmath4 arcmin beam , the central value of @xmath38 parameter is @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the hod and cs model , respectively , because of the significant differences in the masses of quasar hosting halos in the two models . at @xmath5 ,",
    "the host halos in the cs model have masses of @xmath6 , compared to @xmath7 in the hod model . with an observational sample of @xmath73 quasars ,",
    "one will be able to distinguish between the hod and cs models at a very high confidence level statistically , indicating that that the significance level will only be limited by systematic uncertainties . with possible quasar feedback , the expected central y - value uncertainty ranges would be enlarge to become [ @xmath80 , @xmath81 , respectively , for the ( hod , cs ) model , which remain strongly testable with arcmin resolution tsz observations .",
    "upcoming observations , such as advanced act @xcite , may be able to provide a definitive test .",
