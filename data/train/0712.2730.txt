    "the entire region above the transition line is continuously related to the exactly solvable line @xmath264 and , hence , is in the rung - singlet phase .",
    "the entire region below the transition line is in the haldane phase . as with the previous two ladder models , these phases have topological order with confined spinons ; the physics in these phases",
    "is determined by the @xmath127 term in the low - energy hamiltonian . however , contrary to what was found for the cross - coupled and zigzag ladders , from the discussion in the previous section , it is reasonable to expect a regime in between the rung - singlet and haldane phases where the diagonal ladder dimerizes ( i.e. , where the physics is determined by the @xmath131 term ) .",
    "this is , indeed , found to be the case  a narrow , but extended region is found where the ground state is dimerized .",
    "the first order transition is replaced in the weak coupling regime by two second - order transitions .",
    "in this work we considered several frustrated spin ladder models , which are related to higher - dimensional models of current interest . in large regions of parameter space",
    ", these models have short - range rvb ground states with topological order ; they are adiabatically related to the ground states of the rung - singlet or haldane phase .",
    "we investigated the role of frustrating interactions on the models , addressing in particular how the transition between phases with different topological order occurs . in the simplest case ,",
    "a direct transition takes place along the line where the even- and odd - topology phases become degenerate . while the elementary excitations of the topologically ordered phases are gapped magnons , spinons become deconfined along the transition line and a fractionalized phase is obtained .",
    "alternatively , the transition may occur in two steps , with an intermediate phase having broken translational symmetry . in this case , spinons always remain confined .    an important observation from our analysis is the strong `` desire '' for broken - symmetry phases to arise at the transition between the rung - singlet and haldane phases .",
    "indeed , we saw that spin models typically give rise to an infinite number of operators that could cause dimerization.@xcite these operators arose in the diagonal ladder , and a dimerized phase was seen to appear in the phase diagram .",
    "these operators also arose in the cross - coupled ladder ; nevertheless , in agreement with ref .  , we found no evidence for dimerized phases in our numerics .",
    "the rg equations suggest that this occurs due to a subtle interplay / competition of quantum fluctuations .",
    "although no dimerized phase appears in the cross - coupled ladder studied in this paper , in this delicate situation even small perturbations are likely to drive the cross - coupled model into dimerized phases as shown in ref .  .",
    "the zigzag ladder was an exception  the model s geometry fine - tunes away the infinite number of operators which could cause dimerization .",
    "we believe these results give an outlook into the physics of higher - dimensional systems .",
    "in particular , our results show the importance of a system s geometry in achieving the necessary liquidity for fractionalized excitations to occur . hence",
    ", our results illustrate why fractionalized phases are hard to come by  fractionalized phases are delicate objects , requiring some level of fine - tuning . even on lattices where the necessary fine - tuning occurs ( such as the triangular lattice ) , small perturbations due to , e.g. , spin - phonon coupling@xcite or ring exchanges are likely to drive the system into a dimerized phase .",
