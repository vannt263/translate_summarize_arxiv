    "the existence of cold dark matter in the universe is becoming more and more in doubt . as determined by the boomerang experiment , the small amplitude of the second peak relative to the first in the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background does not support the cold dark matter hypothesis @xcite . even within the solar system general relativity",

    "the exterior domain of the numerical solution has been extended in fine resolution to a radius of 60 au , and in coarser resolution to further radius .",
    "the simple solar model used to perform these solutions was a polytrope of order three , and the equations were solved for the metric coefficient @xmath157 and the scalar field @xmath11 , with the metric coefficient @xmath158 removed by coordinate and conformal transformations .",
    "the fermion field was handled by following the averaging procedure used in @xcite and solving in terms of generic fermion number density and pressure .",
    "the main methods of solution were runge - kutta integrations and newton - raphson relaxations .",
    "boundary conditions at the limb of the source were provided by requiring compatibility with observation . for the metric field ,",
    "the schwarzschild solution is known to be very accurate in the inner solar system for light deflection and precession observations , so the metric field was required to match well with the schwarzschild solution at the limb of the sun .",
    "the scalar field has it s value normalised to one at this point .",
    "the limb gradient of the scalar field can be limited in magnitude by compatibility with existing observations , or a more specific value can be produced by reference to the anomalous motion of the pioneer spacecraft .",

    "the metric field continues to agree with schwarzschild to good order , up to the accuracy limits of the numerical methods .",
    "the scalar field assumes a very slight and asymptotically decreasing gradient which varies very slowly across the exterior domain .",
    "the results are very similar to the restricted analytic solution described above , but with the inclusion of the metric field in the mass term resulting in a slower variation of the scalar field gradient .",
    "it is expected that with improving accuracy of the far - field methods that the scalar field will vary more slowly again .",

    "the value of @xmath165 is set through the boundary conditions , and that of @xmath166 by the stability of the solution at large radius , larger values producing runaway behaviour in the fields at large radius due to the @xmath167 term in the equations .",
    "the form we have found for the scalar field shows a radially and rapidly decreasing gradient in the vicinity of the source . this feature could have relevance as to why anomalous accelerations are not observed for planetary bodies , at least to the accuracy of ranging experiments to date ( @xcite ; see also comments in @xcite ) .",
    "while it is not yet known how the scalar field sourced by more than one body would be configured , we expect that a secondary body , such as a planet , would superpose a similar characteristic well upon the background field produced by the primary",
    ". such a superposition may well result in an average of the scalar field gradient over the volume of the planet that is less than the single - source field gradient .",
    "thus the constituent particles of the planet could , on average , experience less of an anomalous radial acceleration towards the sun than they would if the rest of the planet were not present . in this respect",
    "a planet is unlike a spacecraft , which would not appreciably affect the scalar field in its own vicinity .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the theory of conformal gravity with dynamical mass generation , as originally presented by mannheim @xcite .",
    "the theory has been presented here in a logically consistent format that clarifies some areas in the construction of the theory that have been confused in the past . in particular",
    "it has been emphasized here that since conformal gravity not only is compatible with dynamical mass generation , but also requires it to be predictive , the scalar higgs field is an integral part of the theory and can not be ignored . from this framework ,",
    "analytic and numerical results have been extracted .",
    "the import of these results is that it appears that conformal gravity with dynamical mass generation can reproduce the gravitational effects within the solar system , including the possible pioneer spacecraft accelerations , while still satisfying the standard solar system tests .",
    "this successful outcome was made possible through the inclusion of the scalar field required for dynamical mass generation .",
