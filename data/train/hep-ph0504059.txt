    "two of us have recently extended this method to several generic cases of other low - mass thermal relics that may have been produced in the early universe  @xcite , for example weakly interacting bosons such as the hypothetical axions .    for a generic low - mass particle species @xmath3 that was once in thermal equilibrium , the crucial parameters that enter the structure - formation argument are the assumed particle mass @xmath4 , the number @xmath5 of internal degrees of freedom , the relevant quantum statistics ( boson vs.  fermion ) , and finally the number @xmath6 of effective cosmic thermal degrees of freedom at the epoch when the @xmath3 particles thermally decouple .",

    "quantum chromodynamics is a cp - violating theory , implying that the neutron should have a large electric dipole moment , in conflict with the opposite experimental evidence .",
    "the most elegant solution of this `` strong cp problem '' was proposed by peccei and quinn ( pq ) who showed that cp conservation is dynamically restored in the presence of a new global u(1 ) symmetry that is spontaneously broken at some large energy scale  @xcite .",
    "weinberg  @xcite and wilczek  @xcite realized that an inevitable consequence of the pq mechanism is the existence of a new pseudoscalar boson , the axion , which is the nambu - goldstone boson of the pq symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is explicitly broken at low energies by instanton effects so that the axion acquires a small mass .",
    "unless there are non - qcd contributions , perhaps from planck - scale physics  @xcite , the mass is @xmath8 where the energy scale @xmath9 is the axion decay constant or pq scale that governs all axion properties , @xmath10  mev is the pion decay constant , and @xmath11 is the mass ratio of the up and down quarks . we will follow the previous axion literature and assume a value @xmath12 @xcite , but we note that it could vary in the range 0.30.7 @xcite .    the pq scale is constrained by various experiments and astrophysical arguments that involve processes where axions interact with photons , electrons , and hadrons . the interaction strength with these particles scales as @xmath13 , apart from model - dependent numerical factors .",
    "if axions indeed exist , experimental and astrophysical limits suggest that @xmath14  gev and @xmath15  ev  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most robust limits are those on the axion interaction strength with photons and electrons because the properties of ordinary stars can be used to test anomalous energy losses caused by processes such as @xmath16 or the primakoff process @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "these limits are so restrictive that processes involving the electron and photon couplings will not be significant for the thermalization of axions in the early universe in the post - qcd epoch .",
    "on the other hand , these interactions are also the most model dependent .",
    "axion - models can be constructed where the axion - photon interaction is arbitrarily small . in `` hadronic axion models '' such as the ksvz model  @xcite",
    "there is no tree - level interaction with ordinary quarks and leptons , and in any case , the axion - electron coupling can be very small even in non - hadronic models such as the dfsz model  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the restrictive stellar limits on the electron and photon couplings do not conclusively rule out axions with a pq scale in the @xmath18  gev range that is of interest to us .",
    "the axion - nucleon interaction strength is constrained by two different limits based on the observed neutrino signal of supernova 1987a @xcite . the axionic energy loss caused by processes such as",
    "@xmath19 excludes a window of the axion - nucleon interaction strength where the axionic contribution to the loss or transfer of energy would have been comparable to or larger than that of neutrinos . for a sufficiently large interaction strength , axions no longer compete with neutrinos for the overall energy transfer in the supernova core , but then would cause too many events in the water cherenkov detectors that observed the neutrino signal .",
    "however , there is a narrow intermediate range of couplings , corresponding to @xmath9 around @xmath18  gev , i.e.  to an axion mass of a few  ev , where neither argument is conclusive . in this `` hadronic axion window , '' these elusive particles",
    "may still be allowed .",
    "this observation has previously led to the speculation that axions with ev - masses could contribute a significant hot dark - matter fraction to the universe  @xcite .    assuming that axions do not couple to charged leptons , the main thermalization processes in the post - qcd epoch involve hadrons  @xcite @xmath20 due to the scarcity of nucleons relative to pions , the pionic processes are actually by far the most important .",
    "therefore , we need the axion - pion interaction which is given by a lagrangian of the form  @xcite @xmath21 in hadronic axion models where the ordinary quarks and leptons do not carry pq charges , the coupling constant is  @xcite @xmath22 in non - hadronic models an additional term enters that could , in principle , reduce @xmath23 .",
    "for the dfsz model , the relevant @xmath24-@xmath25-mixing strength was derived by carena and peccei  @xcite . in the dfsz model , however , axions in our @xmath9 range are already excluded so that we mainly focus on hadronic models .",
    "axions are an often - cited cold dark matter candidate if they interact so weakly ( if @xmath9 is so large ) that they never achieve thermal equilibrium  @xcite . in that case coherent oscillations of the axion field are excited around the qcd transition when the pq symmetry is explicitly broken by instanton effects",
    ". however , if @xmath9 is sufficiently small so that axions interact sufficiently strongly , they will thermalize and survive as thermal relics in analogy to neutrinos  @xcite . in the ev - range of axion masses that is of interest to us",
    ", thermalization will happen after the qcd transition so that one has to consider axion interactions with hadrons rather than interactions with quarks and gluons that would be relevant at earlier epochs .",
