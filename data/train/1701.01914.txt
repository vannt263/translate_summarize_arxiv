    "around 200 years ago , carnot revealed that thermodynamic efficiency in a cyclic process with two heat baths with inverse temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is bounded by a universal function of these two temperatures , which was turned to be the celebrated carnot efficiency @xcite @xmath3 at the same time , carnot also showed that infinitely slow processes ( i.e. , zero power ) realize the maximum efficiency .",
    "an infinitely slow heat engine is however useless in practical sense , and thus a question naturally arises whether finite power engines attain the carnot efficiency , which is the opposite statement of the aforementioned one .",
    "contrary to its apparent triviality , this has still been an open problem in spite of enormous effort for investigation of large power  @xcite , high efficiency  @xcite , and both of them  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that although the question seems to be negative by intuition , it is hard to prove this rigorously in general setups .",
    "in fact , conventional thermodynamics provides no restriction on the speed of processes , and even in the linear response regime the linear irreversible thermodynamics neither prohibits engines at the carnot efficiency with finite power if time - reversal symmetry is broken  @xcite .",
    "the latter work attracted renewed interest in this problem , and many researches are devoted to analyze specific models to find clues for capturing general properties on the relation between finite power and the carnot efficiency .",
    "one frequently - used setup to tackle the problem is a mesoscopic conducting system with non - interacting electrons under a magnetic field , where the incompatibility between finite power and the carnot efficiency is shown through deriving a novel restriction on the onsager matrix  @xcite .",
    "owing to the newly - derived restriction , it is shown both theoretically  @xcite and numerically  @xcite that this system never attains the carnot efficiency at finite power in the linear response regime .",
    "another frequently - used setup is a periodically driven system , for which the onsager matrix can be defined and is in general asymmetric . utilizing the detailed information on microscopic dynamics , refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite respectively demonstrate the incompatibility for underdamped langevin particles with two heat baths and for isothermal driven systems . on the other hand , some researches proposed some ideas to realize these two simultaneously  @xcite ( some comments on these studies are seen in ref .",
    "recently , inspired by the idea of partial entropy production  @xcite , one of the authors has shown this incompatibility for general classical markovian heat engines beyond the linear response regime  @xcite .",
    "however , non - markovian heat engines have not been addressed in the previous works though real experimental heat engines are inevitably non - markovian . on the basis of the recent experimental development of small quantum heat engines  @xcite ,",
    "a general result covering non - markovian heat engines is highly desired .    in this paper",
    ", we establish a trade - off relation between efficiency and speed of operation , which leads to this no - go theorem for general quantum heat engines .",
    "we focus on the fact that most of the energy released from the engine to the cold heat bath remains in the region close to the engine , which leads to finite dissipation in the bath . to prove this intuitive picture rigorously ,",
    "we employ the lieb - robinson bound  @xcite , which claims that a commutator of two observables with different time acting on different regions far from each other can not be large .",
    "the lieb - robinson bound has recently used in various problems including problems on structure of a gapped ground state  @xcite , the lieb - shultz - mattis theorem in higher dimensions  @xcite , the quantum hall effect  @xcite , and thermalization  @xcite . using this bound",
    ", we establish a useful upper bound on the change in a local observable caused by an operation with finite time - interval far from the area on which the local observable acts . applying this bound , we find that the expectation value of energy in the cold bath far from the engine does not largely change .",
    "with help of the pythagorean theorem for quantum relative entropy and some relations on the quantum fisher information  @xcite , we finally arrive at an upper bound for efficiency with the time interval of a cyclic process .",
    "this bound clearly manifests that the faster the engine is operated the less the maximum efficiency becomes .",
    "since the obtained inequality turns to be no more than the second law of thermodynamics in the markovian limit , in which the lieb - robinson velocity diverges , we treat markovian heat engines in a completely different way .",
