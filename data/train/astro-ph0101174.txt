    "there has been considerable progress recently in the study of the formation of galaxies and quasars . both the galaxy ( steidel et al . 1999 ) and quasar ( fan et al .",
    "2000a ) luminosity functions are now observationally determined to redshifts of @xmath4 , probing into the epoch when at least some of these objects are still expected to be assembling . although the evolutions of the galaxy and quasar populations is generally expected to be connected , the detailed nature of this link is yet to be elucidated .",
    "one possibility is that quasars represent a brief phase in the early life of each galaxy . indeed ,",
    "theoretically , one might expect quasar activity to be triggered by the mergers that a galaxy is experiencing during its assembly ( e.g. cavaliere & vittorini 2000 , kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "this assertion has some observational support : the galaxy abundance appears to peak at a somewhat later redshift than does the quasar abundance ( e.g. madau & pozzetti 2000 ) ; and at least infrared  selected quasars appear to preferentially reside in morphologically disturbed hosts ( e.g. baker & clements 1997 ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider a quasar that turns on within an assembling protogalaxy .",
    "the behavior of the gas inside a dark matter ( dm ) condensation during the formation of disk galaxies has been investigated in semi  analytic schemes ( white & rees 1978 ; fall & efstathiou 1980 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ; van den bosch & dalcanton 2000 ) , and numerical simulations ( katz 1991 ; navarro & white 1994 ; navarro , frenk & white 1997 [ nfw ] ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) . in these studies ,",
    "the bulk of the baryons in the halo cool and settle into a rotationally supported disk .",
    "in the simplest picture , the disk material originates as smooth gas , collapsing from the virial radius @xmath5 to its final orbital radius of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the typical spin parameter .",
    "numerical simulations have revealed a more complex process , where a fraction of the infalling gas forms smaller clumps early on ; these clumps then progressively merge together , collide , and dissipate to form larger systems .",
    "a robust feature of galaxy formation is , at least in the early stages , a spatially extended distribution of gas . at the densities expected at @xmath8 for this gas ( @xmath9 times the background density ) , the radiative cooling time ",
    "scales are shorter than the typical dynamical times . in the absence of heat input from stars or a quasar , a significant fraction of this gas",
    "would therefore be cold ( @xmath10k ) and neutral ( fall & rees 1985 ) .",
    "as it contracts inside the dm halo , the cold gas is heated by the halo potential ; this heat is dissipated largely via collisional excitation of the ly@xmath0 , and possible other ( metal ) lines .",
    "the resulting line radiation results in a potentially observable , extended , low  surface brightness ly@xmath0 `` fuzz '' ( haiman et al . 2000 ; fardal et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the presence of a bright central quasar during this phase could strongly enhance the surface brightness in the ly@xmath0 line , since a significant fraction of the quasar s ionizing radiation could be reprocessed into recombination radiation in the same line .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to quantify the expected ly@xmath0 fluxes , and describe constraints that the presence or absence of extended ly@xmath0 `` fuzz '' around luminous quasars implies for the host galaxy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in   [ sec : model ] , we describe a simple toy  model for the distribution of cold gas in a protogalaxy ; in   [ sec : lya ] , we characterize the resulting ly@xmath0 `` fuzz '' ; in   [ sec : constraints ] , we discuss the implied constraints on galaxy formation ; and in   [ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize our conclusions . throughout this work",
    ", we adopt a @xmath11cdm cosmology with @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "in this section , we describe a simple model for the structure of a spherically symmetric , two  phase gas in a dm halo without a central ionizing source .",
    "we shall assume that the gas has a centrally condensed radial profile @xmath14 , and that it consists of a two  phase medium with a cold ( @xmath15k ) mass fraction @xmath16 , and a hot ( @xmath17 ) mass fraction @xmath18 .",
    "the physical state of the gas in a realistic protogalaxy is , of course , likely to be much more complicated , with asymmetric infall of pre  existing dense clumps , an the settling of gas in the central regions into a disk .",
    "nevertheless , this model will serve as a reference point for our discussion in   [ sec : lya ] and   [ sec : constraints ] below .    for sake of concreteness",
    ", we assume that the gas initially settles to a radial profile @xmath19 that satisfies hydrostatic equilibrium within a dark matter halo . for the profile of the halo ,",
    "we follow the description in navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) with a concentration parameter @xmath20 .",
    "however , we assume that the average enclosed mass density is a fraction @xmath21 of the critical density , where we obtain @xmath22 from the spherical top  hat collapse ( rather than using the fixed value of 200 ) .",
    "to obtain @xmath19 , we also assume that the gas is isothermal at the virial temperature of the halo ( makino , sasaki & suto 1998 ) .",
    "it is useful to note that under these assumptions , the gas is centrally condensed with a flat core , and has a mean internal ( volume  averaged ) `` clumping '' of @xmath23 relative to the background baryon density @xmath24 .    in order to obtain the density @xmath25 of neutral gas",
    ", we next assume that a mass fraction @xmath16 of the gas cools and condenses out into a cold phase with @xmath26k .",
    "pressure balance with the remaining hot , ionized gas implies that the densities of the two components are @xmath27 the value of @xmath28 is determined from the condition that the cooling time of the rarefied hot component is equal to the age of the system .",
    "the cooling time is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the cooling function at @xmath31 .",
    "we conservatively adopt a metal  free cooling function ( bhringer & hensler 1989 ) . for the age of the system",
    ", we adopt @xmath32 of the hubble time , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the total ( dark matter + baryons ) mean background density at redshift @xmath35 .",
    "this is roughly the `` mass  doubling '' time for halos of interest in the extended press ",
    "schechter formalism ( see lacey & cole 1993 ; and haiman , spaans & quataert 2000 for a discussion ) .",
    "illustrative results for the cold fraction @xmath16 as a function of radius under the above assumptions are shown in figure  [ fig : fcold ] .",
    "the dashed and solid curves describe halos at redshifts @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively . at both redshifts ,",
    "four different halo sizes are shown , with virial temperatures of @xmath38 = @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( top to bottom ) . at @xmath36 ,",
    "these correspond to halo masses @xmath43 @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ; at @xmath48 , the halo masses are a factor of @xmath49 two smaller .",
    "as expected , the cold fraction is a function of radius in each case , increasing towards @xmath50 where densities are higher and cooling times are shorter .",
    "the cold fraction is larger for smaller halos , which have smaller initial binding energies , and hence cool more rapidly .",
    "the cold fraction increases with redshift , because of the higher densities and shorter cooling times .",
    "although our model is highly idealized , it captures the above scalings ( which are expected to be robust , as long as the cold fraction is determined by the cooling time ) , and provides a conservative estimate of the amount of cold gas . for comparison",
    ", we note that mo & miralda - escud ( 1996 ) have used a different , simplified model of a two  phase medium in order to model quasar line absorption systems . in their model ,",
    "nearly all of the gas is cold within the `` cooling radius '' , defined as the radius at which the cooling time equals the hubble time ( exceeding @xmath5 for all halos considered here ) .",
    "finally , we emphasize that our model assumptions apply only within the virial radius , where the gas has been shock  heated . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we focus on the reprocessing of quasar light within protogalactic halos .",
    "however , the clumpy background gas outside the virial region can itself reprocess ionizing uv radiation into ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "indeed , gould & weinberg ( 1996 ) have shown that ly@xmath0 absorption systems , illuminated by the uv background , can cause significant ly@xmath0 fluorescence ( see bunker et al .",
    "1998 for a current status of observations ) .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that the background gas near a collapsing protogalaxy is highly clumped , and hence could reprocess any ionizing radiation from the protogalaxy into ly@xmath0 emission",
    ". this type of reprocessing of quasar light could be the interpretation of extended ly@xmath0emitting blobs found in the vicinity of quasars ( hu et al .",
    "1991 ; hu et al .",
    "although these blobs are likely associated with small satellite protogalaxies , their ly@xmath0 emission could be dominated by reprocessed quasar light .",
    "we next consider a quasar that turns on at the center of the halo described above .",
    "in general , the cold gas will then be photoionized by the quasar s uv radiation , out to a radius that depends on the quasar s ionizing luminosity . utilizing the spatial distribution of cold gas obtained in our models ,",
    "we first argue that reasonably  sized quasar black holes ( bhs ) can keep most of the cold phase photoionized .",
    "we then compute the characteristic ly@xmath0 surface brightness of such quasar  illuminated protogalaxies .",
    "the radius of the photoionized strmgren sphere around a central quasar embedded in a spherical halo is given by @xmath51^{1/3 } , \\label{eq : rhii}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the ionizing photon production rate of the central source , @xmath53 is the hydrogen recombination coefficient evaluated at @xmath54k , and @xmath55 is the volume averaged mean squared density of cold hydrogen within @xmath56 .",
    "note that in our models , the cold gas is compressed by a factor of @xmath57 , which enhances the local recombination rate by @xmath58 .",
    "however , the cold gas occupies only a fraction @xmath59 of the volume , and hence the compression increases the total recombination rate by an overall factor of @xmath60 .    assuming a fixed cold mass fraction @xmath61 across the halo , and assuming further that the central bh shines at the eddington luminosity ( for typical quasar spectra , this corresponds to an ionizing photon production rate of @xmath62 photons s@xmath63 per @xmath64 of bh mass ; see cen & haiman 2000 )",
    ", we then find the required size of the bh so that the strmgren sphere extends all the way out to the virial radius : @xmath65 here we have utilized a relation between the halo mass , radius , and virial temperature from nfw .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rsrhalo ] ) can be understood by recalling the scalings @xmath66 ; @xmath67 ; and @xmath68 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rsrhalo ] ) reveals that in most halos of interest ( @xmath69 ; @xmath70 ) , converting @xmath71 of the gas mass into a central bh is sufficient to keep most of the cold gas photoionized .",
    "this conclusion is conservative , since we assumed a constant cold fraction @xmath61 , which maximizes the internal clumping and the total recombination rate ( cf .",
    "eqn.[eq : frac ] ) . using the profiles of @xmath16 obtained in our models",
    ", we have verified that for all halos considered in this work , the cold gas can be fully ionized by still smaller bhs , in all cases with @xmath72 .",
    "although the masses of bh s in protogalaxies at @xmath73 are unknown , ratios as large as @xmath74 of the gas mass would be consistent with the sizes of supermassive bh s found in nearby galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) , especially since this ratio can evolve ( and decrease ) as a function of redshift ( menou , haiman & narayanan 2000 ) .",
    "assuming that all of the cold gas in the model halo is photoionized , we obtain the total ly@xmath0 line luminosity as @xmath75 where @xmath76ev is the energy of a ly@xmath0 photon , and the integral represents the total recombination rate of photoionized gas within the halo .",
    "we have explicitly included the volume  filling factor @xmath77 of the cold gas , whose hydrogen number density is @xmath78 , and the fraction 0.68 of case b recombinations that yield a ly@xmath0 photon ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "we also note that additional recombination lines might be observable , including those of heavy elements , provided the halo gas is sufficiently pre  enriched ( see de breuck et al . 2000 for a review of relevant observations ) .    for the halos shown in figure  [ fig : fcold ] , the values of @xmath79 are @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 ( at z=3 ) , and @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 ( at z=5 ) .",
    "the spatial extent of the ly@xmath0emitting gas is a fraction of the virial radius @xmath88 kpc .",
    "as figure  [ fig : fcold ] shows , this fraction varies inversely with the virial temperature of the halo . here",
    "we define @xmath89 as the radius at which the cold fraction is @xmath61 , and assume that the ly@xmath0 radiation is emitted from within a characteristic radius , which we take to be @xmath90 min@xmath91 .",
    "the characteristic angular size @xmath92 of the ly@xmath0emitting fuzz should then be @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the angular diameter distance .",
    "we find that for the halos shown in figure  [ fig : fcold ] , @xmath95 arcseconds . the angular size varies relatively little with redshift and virial temperature , and implies that the typical ly@xmath0emitting fuzz should appear extended and",
    "can be resolved with optical instruments .    the characteristic ly@xmath0 surface brightness within @xmath92 , @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 is the luminosity distance ) , is shown in figure  [ fig : lyaz ] as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "the solid curves correspond to redshifts @xmath98 , and @xmath99 ( top to bottom near @xmath100k ) .",
    "this figure reveals several interesting features .",
    "first , the surface brightness is generally high , and all but the smallest halos should be potentially detectable with current instruments ( see discussion below , and in haiman , spaans & quataert 2000 ) .",
    "second , nearly all of the halo gas remains cold upto a virial temperature of @xmath101k ( cf .",
    "[ fig : fcold ] ) . in this case , the ly@xmath0 fuzz extends out to the virial radius , and the surface brightness has the simple scaling @xmath102 ( here @xmath103 is the volume of the halo ) ; i.e. the surface brightness weakly increases with both virial temperature and redshift .",
    "the latter result arises primarily from the strong dependence of the recombination rate on redshift , @xmath104 [ vs. the @xmath105 surface brightness dimming ] .",
    "third , for higher virial temperatures ( @xmath106k ) , the cold fraction @xmath107 falls somewhat below unity , allowing the cold phase to be compressed , and enhancing the recombination rate and the surface brightness . in this range of virial temperatures ,",
    "the surface brightness scales approximately as @xmath108 [ note that @xmath109 .",
    "both the stronger dependence on @xmath38 and the inverse scaling on redshift result from the dependence of the cold fraction on @xmath31 .",
    "note that for still higher virial temperatures , the cold fraction would decrease to negligibly small values , and the surface brightness would drop sharply , but this happens only for exceedingly large halos .    in order to illustrate the robustness of the above conclusions ,",
    "we have computed the surface brightness in two variants of our model .",
    "first , to facilitate comparison with earlier work , we adopt @xmath110 rather than @xmath111 , as the condition used to compute the cold fraction @xmath107 . the effect of this change on the surface brightness at @xmath48 is shown by the dotted curve in figure  [ fig : lyaz ] . as expected , the cold fraction remains unity for halos upto a higher virial temperature , which reduces the surface brightness by an order of magnitude at @xmath112k .",
    "second , we note that our simplified model would conflict with observations if we applied it to local galaxy clusters ( see , e.g. fabian 1994 for a review ) .",
    "our model would predict a non ",
    "negligible amount of cold gas at the center of at least the lowest mass clusters ( e.g. @xmath113 at redshift @xmath114 ) , where observations show little evidence for cold gas .",
    "this could mean that , in clusters , the cool gas converts quickly and efficiently into ( low  mass ) stars .",
    "alternatively , there could be heat input ( e.g. from higher  mass star formation , sne , etc . )",
    "that effectively slows down the cooling . to mimic this latter scenario ,",
    "we have increased the cooling time by a factor of 10 , equivalent to requiring @xmath115 .",
    "this condition ensures that @xmath116 is predicted for all @xmath114 galaxy clusters .",
    "the effect of this change ( at @xmath48 ) is shown by the dashed curve in figure  [ fig : lyaz ] .",
    "the cold fraction is decreased , which enhances the surface brightness by upto an order of magnitude for halo with @xmath117k .",
    "the main results of the previous two sections are ( i ) in galaxy  sized halos ( @xmath118k ) at redshifts @xmath73 , a significant fraction of the gas should be cold ; and ( 2 ) if this gas is illuminated by ionizing radiation from a central quasar , it should be kept photoionized , and result in a detectable ly@xmath0 fuzz of characteristic size of @xmath119 arcseconds , and surface brightness @xmath120 .    a handful of existing observations in various other contexts have already reached these relevant levels for the ly@xmath0 surface brightness",
    ". examples are the imaging of a proto",
    " cluster region of lyman break galaxies at redshift @xmath121 in a narrow  band ly@xmath0 filter , reaching a sensitivity of @xmath122 in a @xmath4916 hour observation with the palomar 200inch telescope ( steidel et al . 2000 ) .",
    "similar sensitivities have been reached in @xmath495 hours with the keck telescope in blank field searches for high ",
    "redshift ly@xmath0 galaxies ( cowie & hu 1998 ) , and should also be achievable by subaru .",
    "extended ly@xmath0 emission has also been detected around high  redshift radio galaxies ( e.g. de breuck et al .",
    "2000 ) and radio  loud quasars ( possibly related to outflows ; e.g. heckman et al .",
    "1991a , b ; bremer et al .",
    "nevertheless , observations have not yet targeted bright quasars to search for extended ly@xmath0 emission at similar depths .",
    "less sensitive observations ( reaching a few @xmath123 ) did target bright quasars .",
    "bremer et al . ( 1992 ) finds extended emission around two out of three @xmath124 quasars , but a search of another twelve quasars at similar redshifts revealed emission only around one source ( hu & cowie 1987 ) . yet another search around a @xmath125 quasar ( hu et al .",
    "1996 ) has uncovered discrete ly@xmath0 emitting companions , rather than an extended continuous `` fuzz '' .    in summary",
    ", the few existing observations , typically utilizing @xmath126 hour integrations on 4 m telescopes , probe surface brightnesses above @xmath127 , and reveal that luminous quasars are not generally enveloped by ly@xmath0 fuzz at this sensitivity .",
    "this puts a mild constraint on the models , although emission at this level is expected only in the largest halos ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lyaz ] ) .",
    "however , observations that probe bright quasars at about an order of magnitude deeper , would either detect ly@xmath0 fuzz around most sources , or else lead to strong constraints on the type of models discussed here .",
    "provided that the ly@xmath0 fuzz _ is _ detected , its surface brightness , shape and extent , together with the line ",
    "profiles , would constitute an invaluable direct probe of galaxy formation .",
    "it is interesting to consider constraints that would arise on galaxy and quasar formation , should the current trend of _ not _ detecting fuzz persist at fainter fluxes .",
    "one possibility is that quasars turn on only during the later stages of galaxy formation , i.e. at a time when most of the cold gas has already settled to a thin disk , and/or turned into stars .",
    "a lack of ly@xmath0 fuzz would then be naturally explained by the absence of significant amounts of spatially extended cold gas during the luminous quasar phase .",
    "to avoid detectability at the surface brightness threshold of @xmath122 , figure  [ fig : lyaz ] suggests that in halos with @xmath118k , the flux has to be reduced by a factor @xmath128 relative to the predictions of our simple models .",
    "this , implies , in turn , that @xmath129 of the cold gas must already have settled to a disk ( or disappeared ) .",
    "it has been argued that the presence of a disk is indeed a pre ",
    "requisite for the central bh to grow ( sellwood & moore 1999 ) ; furthermore , cold gas in a thin disk is locally toomre  unstable , and might rapidly turn into stars ( e.g. mo et al . 1998 ) .",
    "independent `` evidence '' favoring this scenario is that the heavy element abundances in the broad line region of quasars always appear to be high ( hamann 1999 ) , even at high redshifts .",
    "this requires one or two generations of massive stars to precede the activation of the central quasar .",
    "there are other , less attractive scenarios without ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "if the cold gas is quickly turned into stars , and/or collapse to the central regions , or to a thin disk , this could eliminate ly@xmath0 reprocessing , at least until cold gas is replenished by further accretion or merger with another halo ( i.e. resulting in a short ly@xmath0 duty  cycle ) .",
    "however , this would also imply that a fraction @xmath130 of all quasars should still show ly@xmath0 fuzz , unless the cold gas disappears on an exceedingly short timescale @xmath131 ( see haiman & hui for constraints on the lifetime @xmath132 of the luminous quasar phase ) .",
    "alternatively , one might envision that the cold gas resides in clumps with a small covering factor , allowing most of the ionizing photons to leak out along line of sights traversing only hot ( collisionally ionized ) medium .",
    "however , this explanation requires a minimum cold clump size that exceeds the jeans mass in the cold phase ( rees 1988 ) .",
    "hence , the postulated large clumps are unstable and would fragment to smaller pieces , increasing the covering factor to approximately unity .",
    "yet another scenario with no ly@xmath0 fuzz is if the quasar ( or its associated wind ) has blown out most of the gas from the halo .",
    "however , in this case , one would still expect to see a fluorescent ly@xmath0 outflow around a fraction of quasars `` caught in the act '' of removing the gas .",
    "dust absorption might strongly suppress the ly@xmath0 flux escaping from a medium , even if the medium is optically thin in the lyman continuum , and has been thought to cause the lack of detections of proto  galaxies in early ly@xmath0 surveys .",
    "a strong quenching of ly@xmath0 by dust , however , does not necessarily occur ( see , e.g. neufeld 1991 , or pritchet 1994 for a general discussion ) , especially if most of the ly@xmath0 photons originate in an ionized layer with relatively low dust opacity . furthermore , ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies have been found at high  redshift ( e.g. hu et al . 1996 ; 1998 ) , as expected in models with lower galactic dust abundance , and inhomogeneous dust distribution ( haiman & spaans 1999 ) .",
    "based on these observations , it would appear unlikely that dust can suppress the ly@xmath0 fuzz from around all high  redshift quasars .",
    "indeed , the dust abundance in the early , spatially extended , collapsing phase of the high  redshift halos is likely to be significantly lower than in star  forming galaxies .",
    "even if dust does not suppress the ly@xmath0 emission itself , however , an important question is whether the nucleus can be obscured by dust and rendered undetectable at optical wavelengths .",
    "if this is typical , then ly@xmath0 fuzz should be expected around sub - mm sources , rather than around optical quasars . the extended ly@xmath0 emitting blob of steidel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) has been found to be an exceptionally bright sub - mm source ( chapman et al .",
    "2000 ) , with no visible continuum source .",
    "the ly@xmath0 line luminosity for this object is @xmath133 , while the bolometric luminosity inferred from the sub  mm detections is @xmath134 .",
    "this implies that less than @xmath74 of the uv produced by the source is available to power the extended ly@xmath0 emission , and that most of this uv is used up for this purpose ( to explain the lack of any continuum source )",
    ". it would be surprising if extended ly@xmath0 fuzz was typically produced in a similar way , since it requires a fine  tuning of the unobscured fraction to match the amount of surrounding cold gas .",
    "nevertheless , it would be invaluable to target bright sub ",
    "mm sources ( i.e. those with redshift estimates ) in deep ly@xmath0 searches , to clarify what fraction of them do produce ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "the primary driver ( stellar vs. quasar uv light ) of both the sub - mm and ly@xmath0 emissions remain unclear in the chapman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) source ( as well as in other bright sub - mm sources ) .",
    "nevertheless , the lack of strong sub - mm emission in a second ly@xmath0 blob in the same dataset suggests that the line emission is not necessarily powered by a dust  obscured source .",
    "our models imply a second interesting , although somewhat less stringent constraint on the amount of extended cold gas around quasars . as discussed in   3.1 above",
    ", we find that it is sufficient to convert @xmath135 of the total gas mass into a central bh in order to keep most of the cold gas ionized ( cf .",
    "[ eq : rsrhalo ] ) . we emphasize that this must indeed happen if any ionizing radiation is to escape from the halo",
    ". observations typically indicate that a large fraction of the ionizing radiation from quasars does escape , even for the quasar with the highest known redshift at @xmath136 ( fan et al .",
    "the abundance of this object implies a halo mass @xmath137 , while its luminosity , under the assumption that it equals the eddington limit , implies a bh mass of @xmath138 ( haiman & loeb 2000 ) .",
    "for this halo , under the assumption of a constant cold fraction @xmath61 , equation  ( [ eq : rsrhalo ] ) would imply that a bh as large as @xmath139 is needed to ionize the cold gas and allow the ionizing radiation to escape . based on the profile @xmath16 derived in our models , the requisite bh mass in smaller , @xmath140 . nevertheless , this mass is close to @xmath74 of the total gas mass , and is a factor of @xmath49 two higher than the bh mass inferred directly from the luminosity .",
    "we conclude that a large escape fraction of the ionizing continuum from bright , high ",
    "redshift quasars requires either ( 1 ) massive central bh s whose masses are a significant fraction ( @xmath135 ) of the gas mass , or ( 2 ) that some of the cold gas has settled to a disk ( or disappeared in a blow  out ) .",
    "finally , we note that any significant continued gas infall at large radius , or a major merger spreading cold gas over an extended region , could still reprocess much of the quasar s radiation to ly@xmath0 ; although the surface brightness at large radii might drop below detectable levels .",
    "in this paper , we have studied what would happen to a protogalaxy if a bright quasar were to turn on during the early stages of its assembly . using a simple spherical model for the distribution of a two  phase gas",
    ", we find that such a system should have a substantial amount of cold , photoionized gas with a spatially extended distribution .",
    "we expect this conclusion to be generic , due to efficient radiative cooling at high redshifts .",
    "the cold , photoionized gas is detectable as an extended ly@xmath0 fuzz enshrouding the quasar ; with a characteristic angular size of a few arcseconds , and a surface brightness of @xmath141 .",
    "existing observations have not yet targeted luminous quasars at these sensitivities , although at @xmath142 , most quasars do not appear to be enveloped by extended emission .",
    "future , deep ly@xmath0 imaging of few arcsecond regions around luminous quasars ( as well as bright sub ",
    "mm sources ) should be possible with current instruments . while a detection of ly@xmath0 fuzz would provide a direct probe of galaxy formation ; non  detections at the level of @xmath143 would already imply strong constraints .",

    "<S> the absence of detectable fuzz might suggest that most that most of the protogalaxy s gas settles to a self  gravitating disk before a quasar turns on . however , continued gas infall from large radii , or an on  going merger spreading cold gas over a large solid angle , during the luminous quasar phase could also result in extended ly@xmath0 emission , and can be constrained by deep narrow band imaging .    </S>",
