    "the concept of statistical equilibrium thermodynamics has been developed to describe the macroscopic behaviour of physical systems in terms of their microscopic structure , namely the dynamic of their constituent elements such as particles and molecules .",
    "a pivotal issue of this approach is the determination of the energy probability distribution @xmath0 of the system under consideration . for this ,",
    "one first needs to determine the probability @xmath1 that , at any time @xmath2 , the system is to be found in a state @xmath3 characterized by the energy value @xmath4 .",
    "then , factorizing the former states into groups of states with the same energy levels @xmath5 , @xmath6 , one obtains the desired energy distribution @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the system s degeneracy number of the @xmath9th energy level . according to the fundamental equiprobability postulate of statistical mechanics , all the accessible energy states occur equally likely at thermal equilibrium , so that @xmath1 is given its classical definition as a probability .    considering then a system at canonical thermal equilibrium , that is a system of variable energy @xmath4 due to its contact with an @xmath10-molecule heat bath ,",
    "the probability @xmath1 is computed as proportional to the microstates @xmath11 ( equiprobability postulate ) of the heat bath , where @xmath12 denotes the constant total energy of the system plus the thermal bath , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "then , considering the heat bath in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath14 , so that the energy levels @xmath15 are a continuum , @xmath16 and assuming further that @xmath17 is overwhelmingly larger than the energy @xmath4 of the system , thus satisfying the condition @xmath18 , one performs a taylor expansion of @xmath19 around @xmath20 to obtain @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 . the exponential term in eq . ( [ intro:01a ] )",
    "is called boltzmann factor .",
    "then , the canonical energy distribution of the system is determined as @xmath23 considering the system in the thermodynamic limit as well , @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 and @xmath8 can be expressed as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is now the density of states , eq . takes its continuous form as @xmath28 we stress though that the passage from eq . to eq .",
    "is not strictly derived , but it is justified as the most natural choice @xcite .    as we have seen above , four assumptions have been invoked for the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ intro:03 ] ) , i.e. , the equiprobability postulate as the thermal equilibrium condition , a system of negligible energy compared to the energy of the heat bath , and the thermodynamic limit of both the heat bath and the system in order to obtain continuous energies and being able to apply the calculus .",
    "it is thus scientifically an intriguing question to explore whether there is a way to derive the energy distribution in the canonical case , by minimizing or even if possible eliminating the preceding assumptions and how this would affect the final results . in an effort to answer this question , in this work , we follow a novel approach to derive the energy distribution of a system composed of @xmath29 identical molecules at the canonical equilibrium .",
    "the cornerstone of our approach is , instead of equal probabilities , to use the internal energy extensivity property , i.e. , the proportionality to @xmath29 , as the thermal equilibrium condition .",
    "interestingly enough then , non of the four assumptions are needed for the derivation of the canonical distribution within this approach .",
    "the results , as expected , are shown to be more general than the textbook ones , providing new perspectives within statistical thermodynamics , which we indent to explore closer in the future .",
    "for this purpose , we first define in section [ ensemble ] the canonical ensemble of discrete energy states through a minimum number of statistical mechanical conditions ( excluding thereby the equiprobability postulate ) , showing that it satisfies indeed the energy extensivity .",
    "however , the related discrete energy probability distribution @xmath30 , is not to be considered at this stage as the canonical distribution .",
    "its structural generality is to be reduced by requesting the validity of the equilibrium condition in the continuous limit as well .",
    "this is done in section [ ced ] , where we extend the discussion to the continuous case .",
    "the obtained continuous distribution @xmath31 is now the canonical one and by discretizing it we determine @xmath30 for the discrete energies levels .",
    "our results show that the currently derived canonical distribution contains the boltzmann factor @xmath32 , as in eq .",

    ", we present some numerical results to support our findings .",
    "finally , discussion and remarks are presented in the conclusions .",
    "in this section we will introduce the discrete energy ensemble describing a system being at canonical equilibrium .",
    "we consider therefore a closed system composed of @xmath29 molecules plus the reservoir .",
    "we denote the sample space of all possible mutually exclusive discrete energies @xmath35 of the @xmath36th molecule by @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "then , the probability of finding the @xmath36th molecule with energy @xmath35 is denoted as @xmath39 .",
    "it satisfies the following normalization condition @xmath40 in each sample space @xmath41 .",
    "the boundary values @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the double inequality in eq . are excluded since @xmath44 would imply the existence of a unique energy value @xmath35 and @xmath45 would imply that @xmath35 is not a constituent element of @xmath41 .",

    ", we assume in what follows that the molecules are identical , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "the index @xmath36 will be used , when necessary , only for heuristic reasons .",
    "then , the canonical ensemble of the total @xmath29-molecule system is defined by the following three conditions :    * the sample space @xmath47 of the energy states @xmath48 is determined by a the tensor product @xmath49 of the sets @xmath41 over the conjunction operator @xmath50 @xcite , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the cardinality of @xmath47 computed as @xmath53 * the probability of occurrence for the @xmath3th state is described by the multiplicative composition rule , e.g. , @xmath54 .",

    "satisfies indeed the normalization condition as a consequence of eq . and the conditions c1-c2 for any energy value @xmath58 and any arbitrary structure of @xmath74 .",
    "having determined the structure of the probability measure @xmath1 yielding the likelihood of the occurrence of the @xmath3th state in eq . , we may now consider the likelihood of the occurrence of the states with the same energy . to this aim",
    ", we relabel the @xmath61 with a new index @xmath75 , so that each @xmath9 corresponds to a set of states exhibiting the same energy @xmath5 .",
    "apparently , @xmath5 satisfies eq . for @xmath76 .",
    "then , by virtue of eq .",
    ", we determine the probability with which a state occurs with the energy @xmath5 as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath8 is the degeneracy number of the @xmath9th energy value of the system . in the general case of a nonlinear dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath79 ,",

    "identifying @xmath83 with the internal energy of the system , we see that the ensemble @xmath47 under the conditions c1-c3 satisfies indeed the thermal equilibrium condition , i.e. , the energy extensivity , justifying the denomination of the discrete canonical ensemble .",
    "it is worth remarking , that eq . is valid only as long as @xmath29 and @xmath86 are finite , warranting the finiteness required to interchange the order of the summation",
    "in this section , our aim is to derive the continuous version of eq . subject the maintenance of the energy extensivity . for this , we first need to find a passage to transit from discrete to continuous energies , @xmath87 .",
    "there are two options for this , the textbook one , i.e. , the thermodynamic limit of the system @xmath24 , or @xmath88 . considering the discrete energy expression in eq .",
    "( [ stateenergy_j ] ) for @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath89 , we can see that the only quantity exhibiting a dependence on @xmath29 is the frequency @xmath90 of finding the energy value @xmath58 within the energy state @xmath91 .",
    "however , irrespective of the number of the constituent molecules of the system the image of @xmath90 is always an integer number .",
    "therefore , considering the limit @xmath92 , the energy values @xmath5 do not become continuous .",

    "having assumed this dependence , we take the logarithm of both sides of the equation above , namely @xmath125 , and then take derivative of both sides with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "this yields    @xmath126    enforcing the extensivity of the mean energy i.e. , @xmath127 ( see eq .",
