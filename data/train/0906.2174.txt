    "the role of dipole - dipole interactions in the structure and dynamics of quantum many - body systems is at the forefront of both theoretical and experimental research .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is long - ranged and anisotropic , in contrast to the isotropic @xmath0-wave contact interaction , and leads to novel physics in ultracold spinor  @xcite , fermonic  @xcite and bosonic  @xcite many - body systems .",
    "for example , the anisotropy of the dipole - dipole interaction leads to unusual properties of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "the condensate will experience `` magnetostriction , '' wherein its aspect ratio does not match that of the trap in which it is confined  @xcite .",
    "additionally , a dipolar bec ( dbec ) is expected to exhibit novel density profiles , for instance a biconcave shape where the maximum density occurs at the periphery of the condensate rather than at its center  @xcite , or else more elaborate densities for non - cylindrically symmetric traps  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to magnetostriction , these density profiles have not thus far been directly imaged in experiments since shapes in the dentiy profiles likely wash out upon expansion of the condensate .",
    "unusual density distributions are , however , intimately related to a more clearly observable property of the gas , namely , its macroscopic collapse .",
    "because the dipole - dipole interaction is always attractive for dipoles in a head - to - tail orientation , a dbec will always become unstable for a sufficiently large dipole density and collapse inward , just as is the case for atomic becs with attractive contact interactions .",
    "the novelty is that , since the dipole - dipole interaction is anisotropic , the density at which the instability occurs depends on the aspect ratio of the harmonic trapping potential that confines the dipoles .",
    "this instability has been probed experimentally in a dbec of atomic @xmath1  @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the condensate was stabilized by tuning the @xmath0-wave scattering length to a sufficiently large value .",
    "instability was then triggered by reducing this scattering length below a critical value .",
    "strikingly , the observed anisotropic density distribtion of the collapsed cloud was well - reproduced within the mean - field theory  @xcite .    on the theory side ,",
    "the detailed mechanism of the collapse has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the picture that emerges is that for sufficiently oblate traps the collapse of the dbec occurs via local density fluctuations , rather than a global collapse to the trap s center . in this case",
    "the instability is driven by fluctuations into a soft `` roton''-like mode , which is unique to condensates with dipolar interactions  @xcite .",
    "depending on the trap s aspect ratio , the roton can have nodal surfaces in either the radial or angular coordinate , for a cylindrically symmetric condensate , and these nodal patterns should dictate the details of the condensate s collapse . in particular , for condensates with a biconcave density profile , the roton decay mode should always have an angular nodal pattern . measuring an angular collapse would then be an experimental signature of the biconcavity .",
    "thus far there is no direct experimental evidence for the roton or for the local collapse in a dbec , although we have argued that the data in ref .",
    "@xcite supports the idea of a local collapse  @xcite .",
    "further , ref .",
    "@xcite has explored circumstances of local collapse in various trap geometries , contrasting approches where the collapse is initiated by either rapid or else adiabatic changes in the scattering length .    in this article",
    "we therefore tackle head - on the prospects for observing local collapse .",
    "after some preliminary remarks in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] , we proceed in sec .  [",
    "sec : local1 ] to analyze and extend the experimental result in ref .",
    "we argue that for oblate traps the scattering length required to stabilize the condensate can be explained within mean - field theory , but only if the collapse occurs locally .",
    "further , the distinction between local and global collapse becomes more clear if the number of dipoles is increased . in sec .",
    "[ sec : local2 ] we develop an understanding of a more direct measurement of condensate collapse , following the experimental procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , which includes an expansion that allows for imaging of the cloud .",
    "we show that angular structure in the expanded image is a direct signature of biconcave structure .",
    "consider a dilute gas of dipolar entities each with dipole moment @xmath2 polarized in the axial ( @xmath3 ) direction .",
    "the interaction between two such entities interacting by both the dipole - dipole and contact interactions is given , in cgs units , by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the distance between the particles , @xmath6 is the angle between @xmath7 and the @xmath3-axis , @xmath8 is the particle mass and @xmath9 is the @xmath0-wave scattering length of the particles .",
    "the contact interaction ( second term in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) ) is either repulsive ( @xmath10 ) or attractive ( @xmath11 ) , regardless of the orientation of the particles .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction ( first term in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) ) , however , changes sign depending on the particle s orientation .",
    "two dipoles aligned in the direction of their polarization ( @xmath12 ) attract each other while two dipoles aligned orthogonal to this direction ( @xmath13 ) repel each other .",
    "we consider such a gas confined by a harmonic potential of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the trap aspect ratio , describing to what degree the trap is prolate ( @xmath16 ) or oblate ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the trapping potential introduces a zero - point contribution to the condensate energy which serves to stabilize the system . a gas without dipoles but possessing a small negative scattering length proves stable for sufficiently low density at any trap aspect ratio .",
    "the negative scattering length at which the condensate goes unstable scales only weakly with trap aspect ratio .",
    "when the stability threshold is crossed , e.g. when the scattering length becomes sufficiently negative to destabilize the bec , the condensate undergoes macroscopic collapse . for purely contact interactions ,",
    "the mean - field potential of the condensate is directly proportional to the density of the condensate , so collapse occurs where the particle density is greatest , at the center of the trap  @xcite .    by contrast , the trap aspect ratio plays a decisive role in determining the stability of a dbec . in a prolate trap",
    ", a dbec behaves much like a bec with attractive contact interactions .",
    "this geometry favors attraction between dipoles and will induce a global collapse to the center for a critical dipole - dipole interaction strength .",
    "vice versa , a dbec in an oblate trap might be expected to behave much like a bec with repulsive contact interactions since the dipolar entities are predominately repulsive in this geometry . however , as shown in  @xcite , there exists a finite critical dipole - dipole interaction strength , for any aspect ratio , at which a dbec becomes unstable .",
    "the mechanism for collapse in this large @xmath18 regime , however , is very different than that of a dbec in a prolate trap or of a bec with purely contact interactions .    in an oblate trap ,",
    "the axial trapping frequency is large , which acts to suppress elongation in the trap center , rendering the global collapse unlikely . instead",
    ", the dipoles in the condensate are expected to form local density maxima whose spatial widths are on the order of the axial harmonic oscillator length @xmath19 .",
    "each such bunch of dipoles then elongates axially , leading to local collapse .",
    "these local density maxima are related to the softening of a roton mode , whose characteristic wavelength @xmath20 sets the scale of the local collapse  @xcite .",
    "thus far only one experiment has explored the stability of a dbec as a function of the trap aspect ratio  @xcite . rather than tune the dipole moment to a critical value , the experiment",
    "instead artificially stabilized the condensate by introducing a positive s - wave scattering length via a fano - feshbach resonance . upon reducing the scattering length below a critical value @xmath21 ,",
    "the experiment was able to trigger collapse in the dbec .",
    "the resulting experimental stability diagram ( reproduced from  @xcite ) is presented in figure  [ fig : n20000 ] as a plot of the critical scattering length @xmath21 versus aspect ratio @xmath18 .",
    "these results represent the measurement performed on a condensate of @xmath22 @xmath23cr atoms . for prolate traps ,",
    "a comparatively large scattering length is required to achieve stability . as @xmath18 is increased ,",
    "the zero - point energy in the axial direction stabilizes the dbec , and stable condensates are possible with a smaller critical scattering length .",
    "this figure also shows the results of two alternative numerical calculations of critical scattering length . in one ,",
    "the theoretical division between stable ( shaded ) and unstable ( unshaded ) regions of parameter space is determined by numerically solving the nonlocal gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) using the potential in  ( [ v ] ) .",
    "a second approach , already employed as an approximation in the experimental paper , shows the dividing line between the stable and unstable regions as a dashed line .",
    "this approximation posits a gaussian ansatz wave function ( normalized to unity ) : @xmath24}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the variational parameters and @xmath27 , where @xmath28{\\omega_\\rho^2 \\omega_z}$ ] is the geometric mean trap frequency . using this ansatz , the gross - pitaevskii energy functional  @xcite , @xmath29 = \\int \\left [ \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}|\\nabla \\psi({\\mathbf{r}})|^2 + u({\\mathbf{r}})|\\psi({\\mathbf{r}})|^2 \\right .",

    "the presence of a minimum , local or global , corresponds to the presence of a stable ground state .",
    "a key feature of the gaussian trial wave function is that it always places the maximum density in the condensate s center , i.e. , it is incapable of describing local collapse . for prolate traps ,",
    "the maximum density _ is _ in the center . in this case",
    "the gaussian _ ansatz _ and the numerical solution to the gpe agree with each other on the critical scattering length , and they both are in good agreement with the experimental result .",
    "care must be taken , however , using this approximation for oblate condensates .",
    "this can be seen in the @xmath17 region of the stability diagram in figure  [ fig : n20000 ] , where the gaussian _ ansatz _ predicts a lower critical scattering length than does the gpe .",
    "we attribute this difference to the ability of the gpe to model local collapse .",
    "indeed , for larger aspect ratios we observe local collapse into roton - like modes , as we will discuss in the next section , and as have been reported in ref . @xcite .",
    "further , the experimental determination of @xmath21 tends to show better agreement with the gpe prediction than with that of the gaussian _",
    "we interpret this as experimental support for the occurence of local collapse , albeit somewhat indirect evidence .",
    "however , the roton modes involved in collapse might have either radial or angular nodal structure .",
    "this experiment does not make this distinction .    within the uncertainty in the experiment",
    ", the data in figure  [ fig : n20000 ] discriminates between the two methods , but one may wish for a clearer discrimination .",
    "we therefore consider cases where the atom number is increased .",
    "the critical scattering length @xmath21 is shown in figure  [ fig : stab ] for dbecs with atom numbers of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . for a given trap , increasing the number of dipoles increases the relative importance of the dipole - dipole interaction , which acts to further destabilize the condensate .",
    "thus , as predicted by the gpe , @xmath21 increases with increasing atom number .",

    "the points show the experimental results of  @xcite , the shaded regions show the results of solving the gpe exactly and the dashed line shows the results of the gaussian _ ansatz_. the theoretical methods disagree as trap aspect ratio @xmath18 increases , and the exact results fit the experimental data with great accuracy .",

    "the lines without crossed symbols are the results of the gaussian _ ansatz _ and lines with crossed symbols are the results of the exact solution of the gpe .",
    "notice how , as @xmath30 is increased , the gaussian _ ansatz _ predicts a more stable condensate while the exact solution predicts a less stable condensate . ]    although figure  [ fig : stab ] plots only the domain of aspect ratios @xmath40 , it is straightforward to obtain the stability thresholds in the @xmath41 and the @xmath42 limits for fixed @xmath43 .",
    "these limits are usefully described in terms of the characteristic dipole length , given by ( in cgs units )  @xcite @xmath44 in the limit of large dipole - dipole interactions , @xmath45 , the interaction - dependent term in @xmath32 $ ] dominates over the other terms since it scales with @xmath30 .",
    "thus , in this limit , the condensate is unstable if this interaction - dependent term is negative .",
    "now , to treat the limits of very small and large @xmath18 , we consider , respectively , the harmonic trapping potential in the limits @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    taking the limit @xmath46 corresponds to an infinitely prolate , or cigar - shaped trap . in this geometry ,",
    "the dipolar mean - field term reduces to a simple coupling to the condensate density , @xmath48 because the dipole - dipole interaction reduces to a delta - function in @xmath49 for this geometry .",
    "thus , in the quasi-1d geometry , the total mean - field term becomes @xmath50 .",
    "similarly for the limit @xmath47 , corresponding to an infinitely oblate trap , the dipolar mean - field term reduces to @xmath51 , giving a total mean - field term of @xmath52 for this geometry .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath45 , we find that the dbec is unstable when @xmath53 for @xmath41 and the dbec is unstable when @xmath54 for @xmath42 .",
    "these limits are indicated in figure  [ fig : stab ] , and the mean - field calculations are detailed in appendix  [ app : meanfield ] .",
    "to take a closer look at the nature of collapse , it is necessary to track the collapse itself as a function of time .",
    "this , too , has been achieved in the @xmath1 dbec experiments , which are excellently reproduced by time - dependent mean - field theory  @xcite .",
    "these experiments have not , however , focused directly on observing consequences of local collapse . here",
    "we discuss the prospects of making such a measurement .",
    "briefly , in such an experiment the scattering length is altered from a value where the condensate is stable against collapse to a somewhat lower value @xmath55 .",
    "after this transition , the atoms begin their collapse into high density regions where three - body recombination takes over , ejecting atoms from the trap .",
    "the trap is generally released after some hold time , to expand the cloud for imaging .",
    "the resulting density patterns show intricate shapes and depend on details such as whether the passage from stable to unstable is adiabatic or diabatic  @xcite .",
    "the underlying physics of the instability and collapse is determined by the softening of the roton modes .",
    "we compute these modes by solving the bogoliubov de gennes equations as in ref .",

    "plotted is the energy of the excitation as a function of the scattering length @xmath9 , labeled by its azimuthal angular momentum quantum number @xmath58 .",
    "the solid lines depict the real parts of these energies , while the symbols represent their imaginary parts .",
    "as @xmath9 diminishes , the energies of these modes drop to zero , and thereafter become purely imaginary . the first such transition , at @xmath63 , identifies the scattering length at which the dbec is dynamically unstable , since any small perturbation is capable of exciting this mode , which then grows exponentially in time .",
    "thus an unstable condensate quickly grows high - density peaks in regions defined by the antinodes of these modes .",
    "figure  [ fig : ex8 ] is a particular example illustrating the modes that contribute to instability at a particular aspect ratio @xmath62 . at this aspect ratio",
    "the condensate s density exhibits a biconcave shape , and so decay into angular rotons is expected .",
    "we stress that at all aspect ratios where the maximum density lies at the center rather than at the periphery , the rotons responsible for instability are always @xmath64 modes that do not exhibit an angular structure .",
    "this connection is essential to connecting observed angular decay circumstantially to biconcave structure .",

    "the real parts are represented by solid lines and the imaginary parts , developing where the real parts go to zero , are represened by markers .",
    "the @xmath68 mode , being the first to develop a nonzero imaginary energy , serves to define @xmath21 for this aspect ratio . ]",
    "the mode that brings about the dynamical instability determines not only the scattering length at which the condensate will collapse , but also _ how _ the condensate will collapse as the stability threshold is crossed .",
    "consider preparing a dbec of @xmath33 @xmath1 atoms just above the stability threshold in a trap with aspect ratio @xmath62 .",
    "these are the collective modes whose energies are shown in figure  [ fig : ex8 ] .",
    "a small jump in scattering length to a value just below @xmath21 would cause the condensate to go unstable by a macroscopic occupation of the @xmath68 mode that has a nonzero imaginary energy at this scattering length .",
    "the density of the condensate during the collapse would change , on a time scale @xmath71 $ ] , as the atoms macroscopically occupy three clumps that self - attract in the @xmath3-direction .",
    "decay of the condensate into a roton mode with @xmath72 requires breaking the condensate s initial cylindrical symmetry by introducing fluctuations into the mode . in an experiment",
    "this is caused by thermal fluctuations , but in our calculation we must make this happen artificially .",
    "to do this , we seed the condensate wave function by adding to it a small contribution of the excited state mode : @xmath73 where @xmath74 describes the basic angular variation of the roton mode , and @xmath75 is an additional phase that will determine the overall rotation of the collapsed condensate . in the absence of a seed like this , the numerical solution remains at its unstable equilibrium for a time long compared to the natural lifetime @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "the apparent lifetime in this case is determined by the time before roundoff error starts to affect the time evolution of the gpe .",
    "however , once the wave function is seeded as above , the decay occurs on the expected time scale .",
    "after the collapse is triggered , the condensate indeed forms the three clumps as expected , as seen in figure  [ fig : phase ] .",

    "each peak was initially seeded by a density fluctuation at the antinode of the @xmath68 excited state roton wave function .",
    "thus the three peaks are uniformly equally spaced in angle , as befits the symmetery of the mode .",
    "an angular display of this sort would provide unambiguous evidence for nonlocal collapse .",
    "moreover , the fact that the collapse occured in an angular coordinate provides indirect evidence for the biconcave structure of the initial state .     collapsed condensate in a trap with mean frequency @xmath67 hz and aspect ratio @xmath70 after @xmath79 ms .",
    "the perturbation for the collapse is controlled to have @xmath68 symmetry and the global phases as shown in the frames .",

    "the collapsed condensates are rotated by @xmath80 , ensuring that the finite grid size does not influence the small length scale dynamics of the condensate collapse . ]",
    "while the relative positions of the three peaks in this experiment are well - defined by the symmetry of the roton mode , there is still an overall undetermined angle of rotation of the whole pattern .",
    "numerically , this is set by the angle @xmath75 in ( [ one_fluctuation ] ) .",
    "since the angular dependence of the condensate density , with this wave function , is proportional to @xmath81 , we expect that , if there is no unphysical dependence on the numerical grid , the collapse will occur rotated by an angle @xmath82 for any initial phase @xmath75 .",
    "indeed , we find that the collapse dynamics are unaffected by the grid , as is illustrated in figure  [ fig : phase ] . here , we input the initial phases @xmath83 and @xmath84 and find that the collapsed wave function is rotated by exactly these phases times @xmath85 . although not shown here , simulations for other initial phases give the same results . based on this ability to reproduce the same angular pattern , but rotated in a predictable way , we conclude that the underlying cartesian grid is adequate to describe this collapse .",

    "the results of simulations that are very similar to the ones described above are presented in  @xcite , where dbec collapse is modeled in - trap and not through the expansion process and not including a three - body loss term in the simulation .",
    "@xcite performs simulations of dbec collapse for both adiabatic and non - adiabatic ( instantaneous ) jumps in scattering length , and find very interesting results regarding the presence of global and local collapse in the condensate dynamics . for adiabatic collapse , where the change in scattering length is sufficiently slow to track the condensate across the roton softening in the bdg spectrum , they present a critical trap aspect ratio above which local collapse occurs .",
    "we confirm these results , but point out that while local collapse is very interesting ( and can be evidence for the presence of the roton in these systems ) , its manifestation in a dbec is much richer than has been discussed in previous work .",
    "a mapping of dbec collapse via the experiment proposed above can determine not only whether collapse was global or local , but whether collapse was radial or angular and thus provide evidence for the underlying biconcave structure .",
    "we point out that the experiment proposed above is just one of many experimental methods that would demonstrate the angular nature of dbec collapse . certainly , taking data for a number of additional trap aspect ratios would assist in mapping out the regions where biconcavity exists .",
    "also , we expect that smaller and slower jumps in scattering length , which may be had with less uncertainty in the feshbach - induced scattering length , would assist in understanding how and where collapse occurs .",
    "slower ramping of the scattering length allows the condensate to be tracked more adiabatically and thus allows for collapse to begin when only one bdg mode has a nonzero imaginary energy , making the mapping of the collapse much more clear .",
    "instantaneous or very fast jumps in scattering lengths across a biconcave region will miss this structure completely and thus result in a purely radial collapse .",
    "for an angular collapse to occur , the biconcave structure must manifest itself in the condensate prior to collapse .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that in order to correctly map out the stability of a dbec , a computational method that is sensitive to the local nature of dbec collapse must be used .",
    "methods such as the gaussian _ ansatz _ that are not sensitive to such phenomenon will incorrectly predict the stability of the system .",
    "also , we draw a connection between the bdg spectrum of a dbec and the nature of the dbec collapse . not only can the bdg quasiparticles predict where a dbec will collapse in parameter space , they can also predict how a dbec will collapse . for dbecs without biconcave structure , this collapse is purely radial while for dbecs with biconcave structure , this collapse has angular structure . performing collapse and expansion experiments on a @xmath1 dbec",
    "can reveal this angular structure and thus provide an experimental method for mapping biconcave structure in dbecs .",
