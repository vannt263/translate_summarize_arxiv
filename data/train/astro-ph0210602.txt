    "m82 is the prototypical nearby starburst galaxy ; innumerous studies of m82 have been performed in the last decades .",
    "most of these studies focused on the extreme starburst properties and the related prominent outflow emerging from the inner 1kpc of m82 ( at a distance of 3.9mpc , 1@xmath11kpc ; sakai & madore 2001 ) .",
    "the tremendous star forming activity in m82 s central region can be traced by the high fir luminosity ( e.g. , telesco & harper , 1980 ) , the filamentary h@xmath12 outflow ( e.g. , bland & tully , 1988 ; devine & bally , 1999 ) , the extended x  ray outflow ( e.g. , strickland , ponman & stevens , 1997 ) and the existence of @xmath520 compact radio sources identified as supernova ( sn ) remnants and compact hii regions ( e.g. , kronberg et al . , 1981 , pedlar  1999 ) . the central starburst is believed to be fueled by the large amount of molecular gas present in m82 s center ( m@xmath13 , e.g. , wei  2001 ) .",
    "this central concentration of molecular gas is very strong in co emission and has been the subject of many studies .",
    "most of these studies were done with single dish telescopes ( e.g. , stark & carlson , 1982 ; young & scoville , 1984 ; wild  1992 ; mao  2000 ; seaquist & clark , 2001 ; taylor , walter , & yun , 2001 ) addressing both the excitation conditions and the large scale distribution of the molecular gas . some of these studies already provided evidence for extended co emission around m82 s center .",
    "interferometric co studies of m82 s molecular component have so far been limited to the central kpc ( shen & lo 1993 , neininger  1998 , wei  1999 , wei  2001 ) . in this letter , we present the first results of our extensive mapping campaign of the central @xmath14kpc@xmath15kpc of m82 at a resolution of @xmath0 ( @xmath570pc ) .",
    "we observed m82 in the co(1@xmath160 ) transition using caltech s owens valley radio observatory s millimeter array ( ovro ) in c , l and h configurations ( 10 pointing mosaic ) .",
    "this mosaic covers a @xmath1 field , including a significant fraction of the optical disk of m82 as well as its prominent  outflow .",
    "the central pointing was centered near the 2.2  peak at @xmath17 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "the other 9 pointings were shifted by @xmath18 ( ovro primary beam : @xmath19 at 115ghz ) , the field of view is indicated in fig .",
    "1 ( right ) . data were recorded using a correlator setup with 240mhz bandwidth and 2mhz resolution , resulting in a velocity resolution of 5.2  with a total bandwidth of 600  at 115ghz .    for image generation and processing",
    "we used the miriad software package . because extended structure was missed in our interferometer data , the data cube was zero  spacing corrected using the iram 30 m data described in wei  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the combination was done by replacing visibilities shorter than the shortest baseline in the final processed data cube by visibilities computed from the single dish data ( this technique is described in more detail in wei  2001 ) .",
    "the final data cube presented here has a spatial resolution of @xmath20 and an rms noise level of 25mjybeam@xmath7 ( 0.18k ) in a 5.2  channel .",
    "the integrated intensity distribution of our combined mosaic is shown in fig .  1 . the physical properties ( co flux , molecular mass , linear size ) of the newly detected features",
    "are summarized in tab .  1 .",
    "in converting the observed co luminosity to h@xmath21 column densities we applied two conversion ( ` @xmath22 ' ) factors 1 ) @xmath23 , an average value for m82 s central disk ( wei  2001 ) , and 2 ) @xmath24 , the galactic conversion factor ( hunter  1997 ) which is presumably a more realistic value for a non  starburst environment ( such as the molecular streamers s1-s4 , see fig .  1",
    ", right ) .",
    "the total flux detected in the field of view is 17680  ( estimated error : @xmath25 ) .",
    "using @xmath26 for the disk and the outflow o - s+o - n ( which presumably consists of warm gas emerging from the disk , see fig .  1",
    ", right ) and @xmath27 for the molecular streamers s1s4 , we derive a total molecular mass of m82 of @xmath28  ( total masses using other conversion factors can be easily derived from tab .  1 ) .",
    "the different co emitting components in m82 ( disk , streamers , outflow / halo ) have clear kinematic signatures which can be seperated by inspecting consecutive channel maps .",
    "we used this velocity information to subdivide the full ovro co data cube into three sub  cubes out of which individual integrated intensity maps were created for the disk , streamer and outflow / halo component .",
    "these components are shown in fig .",
    "3 ( overlaid as countours on an h@xmath12 map by shopbell et al .",
    "1998 ) : the yellow contours represent m82 s central disk only ( see sec .  3.3 ) ; streamers s1s4 are shown in orange ( sec .",
    "3.4 ) , and the red contours represent an intensity map of the outflow / halo ( sec .",
    "3.5 ) .",
    "the central 1kpc of m82 s co distribution is dominated by the well known triple  peaked molecular distribution ( fig .  1 , see also yellow contours in fig .",
    "3 ) which has been discussed in previous high  resolution co studies .",
    "this region coincides with the strong central star formation and forms the base of the prominent outflow visible in  and x  rays .",
    "it is striking that only about a third of m82 s total co _ flux _ is associated with the center ( see tab .  1 ) .",
    "depending on the employed x  factor this corresponds to a molecular _ mass _ fraction of @xmath29 for the central molecular disk .",
    "several molecular streamers are detected west , east and south  east of the central molecular concentration ( labeled s1 to s4 in fig .  1",
    ", see also orange contours in fig .  3 ) .",
    "the most prominent streamer is located west of the molecular disk ( s1 ) .",
    "its orientation is shaped in a similar fashion and has the same velocity as the prominent hstreamer which points towards m81 ( the m81m82 tidal tail , streamer ` s ' in yun , ho & lo 1993 ) .",
    "a weaker streamer forms the extension of the molecular disk towards the north  east ( s2 ) , roughly following another large ",
    "scale h  streamer ( streamer ` n ' in yun , ho & lo 1993 ) .",
    "s1 and s2 follow very closely the dust absorption features seen in optical images ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "two additional molecular streamers are visible south  east ( s3 ) and east ( s4 ) ; in contrast to s1 and s2 , these two structures are situated _ away _ from the optical plane of the galaxy ( see also figs .  1 , 3 and  5 , bottom ) .",
    "based on the available data , we can not rule out a potential interaction between s3/s4 and the outflow / halo gas .",
    "a summary of the fluxes of s1-s4 is given in tab .  1 .",
    "_ masses : _ molecular gas is clearly associated with the outflow south ( o  s ) and north ( o  n ) of the central molecular disk .",
    "the molecular gas in the outflow / halo is visible up to 0.8kpc north and 1.2kpc south of the disk .",
    "the total mass of molecular gas in the outflow / halo accounts to an impressive amount of @xmath30 , even employing the lower conversion factor @xmath31 .",
    "_ outflow morphology : _ interestingly , the co emission in the outflow / halo ( fig .",
    "3 , red contours ) has an almost spherical shape with a diameter of @xmath32kpc ( this is similar in size to the dust halo discussed in alton et al .",
    "in addition , there is a striking correlation between the h@xmath12 outflow and the molecular gas in the south .",
    "the correlation is less prominent in the north  east of the outflow but clearly visible in the north ",
    "west . the chimney of shocked molecular gas detected in sio by garc ' ia - burillo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) can not be clearly identified in our co data .    _",
    "kinematics : _ for the first time co line splitting is detected in the outflow of m82 .",
    "4 shows a pv diagram of the co gas along the outflow axis of m82 . here ,",
    "a position angle of 150@xmath33 was chosen to allow a comparison with published h@xmath12 velocities ( see caption ) .",
    "the co line splitting is clearly visible between @xmath34 and @xmath35 below the disk ; the velocities agree well with the h@xmath12 velocities .",
    "the blue  shifted co component is not detected below @xmath35 but the other component is traced at similar velocities as the h@xmath12 up to @xmath36 . at @xmath35 ( 660pc below the plane ) , the co is blueshifted by @xmath37with respect to the systemic velocity ( v@xmath38=220 ) . correcting for m82 s inclination ( 80@xmath33 , de  vaucouleurs  1991 ) and our derived cone angle of 50@xmath33 ( see below ) we derive a deprojected maximum outflow velocity of @xmath37/sin@xmath39 .",
    "the situation is more complex in the northern part of the outflow  here the molecular gas seems to be entrained in the h@xmath12 outflow . as is obvious from fig .  4 ,",
    "most of the projected velocities are lower than this value and we estimate an average outflow velocity of the gas of order @xmath40 . based on the escape velocities presented in martin ( 1998 , figure  9 )",
    "we estimate that of order 10% of the outflow gas ( @xmath41 , i.e. , a few percent of the total gas mass ) may be lost to the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "_ outflow cone angle : _ fig .",
    "5 presents pv diagrams along and parallel to the major axis . in the north ,",
    "the rotation curve is flattened which can be interpreted as conservation of angular momentum in the outflow .",
    "a similar morphology is seen towards the southern pv diagram as well ; however , this region is clearly disturbed by the features s3 and s4 .    to determine the orientation of the outflow cone , we derived ` flow  lines ' of the molecular gas ( as first proposed by seaquist & clark 2001 ) .",
    "the basic assumption is that the angular momentum of the gas in the outflow is conserved . for each distance from the plane @xmath42",
    "we calculated the angular momentum @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the terminal velocity at distance @xmath45 from the minor axis .",
    "we took @xmath44 from our first moment map of our ` outflow cube ' ( see above ) ; these values give a reasonable approximation for the true @xmath44 ( see also the discussion in seaquist & clark 2001 ) . the result of this analysis is plotted as contours in fig .  6",
    " each contour represents an iso  angular momentum ( ` @xmath46 ' ) line and describes the flow  line of an individual particle in the outflow .",
    "it is striking how similar the @xmath46contours ( derived entirely from _ kinematic _ information ) are compared to the morphology of the ionized gas in the outflow ( e.g. , fig .  3 ) .",
    "from the third contour ( counting from the minor axis ) in fig .  6 , we derive an average cone angle of @xmath8 ( north : @xmath47 , south : @xmath48 ) , similar to what has been found in previous optical studies ( optical : @xmath49 , bland & tully 1988 , mckeith  1995 , to @xmath50 , heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) .",
    "we note that seaquist & clark ( 2001 ) derived an angle of @xmath51 for the northern and @xmath52 for the southern molecular outflow ; the discrepancy in the south can be explained by confusion of their velocity field by s3 and s4 in their low  resolution data .    _",
    "energetics : _ to calculate an order of magnitude estimate of the kinetic energy of the outflow , we assume that the molecular gas in the outflow ( @xmath53 ) has an average outflow velocity of @xmath54  ( see discussion above ) .",
    "this gives a kinetic energy of @xmath55erg .",
    "extrapolating the current sn rate in m82 of 0.1yr@xmath7 ( kronberg  1981 ) back to the age of the current starburst ( @xmath56yr , oconnell  1995 ) yields a total mechanical input by sne of @xmath57erg . assuming an average outflow velocity of 100  and a distance of @xmath58kpc it takes of order @xmath59yr to build up the molecular outflow , similar to the age of the starburst .",
    "this implies that of order @xmath60 of the released mechanical energy of m82 s central starburst has been converted to kinetic energy in the molecular outflow gas .",
    "our high  resolution ovro observations of the prototypical starburst galaxy m82 provide new exciting insights on the properties of the molecular gas around the galaxy s center .",
    "the newly detected molecular streamers ( both in and below the galaxy s plane ) suggest that the molecular gas in the inner few kpc is severely affected by the interaction with m81 .",
    "this redistribution of molecular gas is likely the trigger for the strong starburst activity in m82 s center .",
    "an impressive amount of molecular gas is detected in the halo of m82 .",
    "it is striking that most of the outflow gas is distributed in an almost spherical halo ; at large distances from the plane its morphology looks remarkably similar to that of the ionized gas .",
    "the gas in the halo is rotating slower than in the disk ; we find that the co kinematics in the halo can be used to constrain the outflow cone angle of the molecular gas ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "our estimated co outflow velocities imply that a significant amount of molecular gas is not only transported to the halo but may also escape the galactic potential .",
    "this has important implications for the chemical evolution of the starburst host galaxy and for the chemical enrichment of the igm , especially in the early universe when much more violent starbursts took place ."
