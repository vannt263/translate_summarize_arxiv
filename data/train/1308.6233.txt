    "@xcite the inner hollow itself can be used for capturing large biomolecules .",
    "@xcite besides , as magnetic materials , they are free of vortex cores , which makes the vortex state more stable than that of nanowires .",
    "this makes nanotubes more suitable as candidates for elements of memory for computers and as a tool for creation of superconductors with high critical fields .",

    "ferromagnetic materials used for formation of nanotubes include ni , @xcite , co @xcite , fept @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite .    together with the experimental progress , theoretical calculations and numerical simulations for nanotubes were performed extensively , dealing with the stable states @xcite , switching behavior @xcite , hysteresis loop @xcite and properties of domain walls ( both static @xcite or dynamic @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors calculated numerically and partly analytically energy of the parallel state and the vortex state as function of the dimensions of the tube and material constants .",
    "phase diagrams were drawn in terms of linear dimensions of the tube . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have shown that the parallel magnetization turns into a vortex - like one at the edge of the tube .",
    "the purpose of our work is to give an analytical description of the magnetic tubes ( mt ) properties employing small parameters characterizing their geometry : the ratios @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the experimentally realized mt the first ratio was in the range of @xmath9 and the second one varied between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the analytical approach allows as to construct the complete phase diagram of the mt in the space of geometric parameters and external magnetic field .",
    "we establish analytical criteria for the appearance and disappearance of different topological magnetic configuration , topological defects and field - induced magnetic textures .",
    "we also calculate the magnetic field produced by the tubes .",
    "we take into account the magnetic interactions of two kinds : the exchange interaction and the dipolar interaction .",
    "the total energy of a mt is : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the spin vector at position @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the exchange constant , @xmath16 is the unit vector from position @xmath14 to @xmath17 , @xmath18 means summation over all nearest pairs , and @xmath19 . @xcite further we use the international system of units .",
    "another often considered contribution to the total energy , the crystal anisotropy is not included here .",
    "this is appropriate when the material is a polycrystal with large number of randomly orientated grains like permalloy .",
    "experimenters @xcite indicate that the size of a single - crystal grain in their nanotubes is about 1 nm . we do not know how strong is the exchange interaction between the grains . in our calculations",

    "is a form analogous to the energy of electric charges interacting via coulomb forces .",
    "this analogy allows to use results well - known in electrostatics .",
    "an important consequence of this analogy is that the dipolar energy is non - negative , since the electrostatic energy is equal to the integral of the square of the electric field .",

    "[ 1 - 9 ] all three strong inequalities were satisfied .",
    "natural candidates to the state with the lowest energy are the most symmetric magnetic configurations : the parallel state : @xmath47 , and the vortex state : @xmath48 .",
    "we denote azimuthal angle as @xmath49 ; the symbol @xmath48 denotes the unit vector in azimuthal direction .",
    "each of these states is two - fold degenerate due to time reversal invariance .",
    "we also consider two other , less symmetric states : the transverse state : @xmath50 , and the so - called onion state . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the onion state ( see fig . [ 2 ] ) , becomes stable in ferromagnetic rings in some range of parameters .",

    "the latter term is much smaller than the former two and further we neglect it .",

    "the condition @xmath45 allows us to use the approximation @xmath63 since @xmath64 is close to 1 . in this approximation",
    "the integration over @xmath65 and @xmath66 is straightforward leading to the result for the self - energy of each edge : @xmath67 .",
    "thus , in the limit of long thin mt the total energy of the parallel state is : @xmath68 .",
    "it does not depend on the tube length @xmath3 .",
    "different magnetic configurations and results of similar calculations of exchange and dipolar energy for them are summarized in table 1 .    while other configurations are trivial , some comments on the onion configuration are necessary .",
    "we seek for a variational distribution of magnetization that satisfies following requirements : magnetization must be parallel to magnetic field ( in the direction @xmath69 ) at @xmath70 and it does not depend on the coordinate @xmath56 in a narrow ring .",
    "a simplest vector field satisfying these requirements has a form @xmath71 with @xmath72 , where @xmath29 is a variational parameter .",

    "( @xmath73 corresponds to the transverse state . )",

    "it corresponds to @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "it is smaller than @xmath77 . since the exchange energy is quadratic in @xmath29 , the minimum of the total onion configuration energy shifts to a value of @xmath29 between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "it is easy to check that the difference of the total onion energy and transverse energy at @xmath73 is zero , whereas the derivative of this difference over @xmath29 is negative .",
    "therefore , its value in the minimum of the onion energy is negative . in other words ,",
    "the onion is energy preferable to the transverse configuration .",
    "if @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the so - called exchange length , the exchange interaction of the onion configuration is much smaller than the dipolar term , so @xmath29 is very close to @xmath79 .",
    "a typical value of @xmath4 is several nanometers .",
    "@xcite the parallel and transverse states have zero exchange energy ; the vortex state has zero dipolar energy . in the absence of magnetic field",
    "the hierarchy of energy scales is as follows : @xmath82 , so the transverse and the onion states are not stable . only the parallel or the vortex states are stable . , it may happen that @xmath83 .",
    "the condition of such stabilization of the transverse configuration is @xmath84 . ] which of these two states is more favorable depends on the ratio : @xmath85 at @xmath5 the parallel states wins , in opposite case the vortex state wins .",
    "the logarithmic factor varies comparatively slowly , and @xmath86 depends mainly on the combination @xmath87 .",
    "we see that large @xmath3 favors the parallel magnetization , while large @xmath1 and @xmath2 favor the vortex magnetization .",
    "it is convenient to introduce dimensionless lengths @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "then @xmath86 can be expressed as @xmath91 equation @xmath92 determines the transition line between the two states . in fig .",
    "[ 3 ] three transition lines in the @xmath93 plane at fixed values of @xmath94 are depicted .",

    "let us consider a tube with one domain wall ( dw ) far from the edges .",
    "calculations in this section are performed in the limit @xmath95 .    in a dw between two opposite parallel states @xmath96 ,",
    "the magnetization can rotate either in the plane @xmath97 , or in the plane @xmath98 .",
    "the corresponding two types of dws have magnetization @xmath99 or @xmath100 where @xmath101 depends on @xmath102 .",
    "these two types of domain walls will be denoted as p1 and p2 , respectively .",
    "similarly , in a dw between two opposite vortex states @xmath103 the magnetization rotates either in the plane @xmath104 , or in the plane @xmath105 .",

    "@xmath133 , @xmath134 are positive for any @xmath126 and turn into zero at @xmath135 .",
    "they are plotted in fig . [",
    "4 ] .    from the positivity of @xmath133",
    ", it follows that @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 are positive since each term in eqs . , and is positive . for the v1 case ,",

    "any solution ( if it does exist ) of the equation for extremum of the energy , i.e. @xmath140 , can only lie between 0 and 0.37 since only in this region is @xmath141 positive . in the same interval",
    "the difference @xmath142 is positive and therefore the energy @xmath138 is also positive .",
    "thus , if the dw energy has a minimum , it must be at a value of @xmath126 smaller than 0.37 . since it was already proved that @xmath143 for @xmath144",
    ", we conclude that inner domain walls are never stable . however , they can exist as metastable states . for the p1 dw and @xmath145 ( negligible dipolar interaction ) ,",
    "the minimum is realized at @xmath146 , i.e. at @xmath147 .",
    "so , if only the exchange energy is considered , the dw width is equal to the radius of the tube .",
    "if the dipolar energy is included , the minimum shifts to @xmath148 .",
    "this looks reasonable , since the volume charge @xmath149 inside the dw has the same sign throughout the wall and it tends to spread out the dw width to reduce the dipolar energy .",
    "the energy @xmath137 differs from @xmath136 only by a positive term @xmath150 .",
    "thus , the p2 dw is always less favorable than the p1 one . for a v1 dw ,",
    "numerical calculations show that @xmath151 has a minimum only at @xmath152 . the value of @xmath126 realizing the minimum of energy at @xmath153 is @xmath154 .",
    "it monotonically decreases with increasing @xmath155 .",
    "thus , the metastable v1 dw exists at @xmath152 and its width is smaller than @xmath156 .    summarizing , under our assumptions no stable dw exist in the middle of the magnetic tube , but they can exist as metastable configurations .",
    "it is well known that dipolar interaction generates a stripe domain structure in a bulk rectangular ferromagnetic slab .",
    "it does not happen in a thin - walled long magnetic tube .",

    "the external magnetic field @xmath157 interacts with magnetization via the zeeman energy : @xmath158 if the external field is directed along @xmath102-axis ( parallel field ) , the azimuthal symmetry is still retained .",
    "a field of any other direction destroys this symmetry .",

    "this feature reminds the stoner - wohlfarth model @xcite .",
    "the reason of the hysteresis in the stoner - wolfarth model is the crystal field anisotropy , i.e. spin - orbit interaction . in magnetic tubes",
    "the geometry is anisotropic . at @xmath171 and magnetic field along the axis of the tube",
    ", the geometric anisotropy keeps the component of magnetization perpendicular to the field and provides a continuous transition at a critical field to completely parallel magnetization . in the opposite case @xmath179 and initial magnetization antiparallel to the field",

    "@xmath180 the magnetization flips .",
    "we considered the mechanism of a coherent magnetization flip resulting in a comparatively large coercive force .",
    "other mechanisms were proposed in @xcite .",
    "the only mechanism relevant to the limit of a long thin tube is the propagation of a vortex domain wall between two opposite parallel configuration .",
    "the vortex dw propagation is favorable if the dipolar energy dominates . in ref .",
    "@xcite , vortex dw propagation is also described and argued to be closely related to the half vortex dws at the tube ends for one parallel state .",
    "notice that in @xcite they also have an almost rectangular - shaped hysteresis loop . while transverse dw propagation is favorable if the exchange energy dominates such that a transverse dw has lower energy than a vortex dw @xcite .",
    "we do not take pinning into account .",
    "it is expected that if pinning is included the hysteresis loop will have a larger coercive force .",
    "now we consider the transverse magnetic field applied to a tube that was initially in a vortex state .",

    "@xmath161 the transverse state @xmath50 is energy favorable .",
    "these two states are topologically different : the former has the winding number 1 while the latter has the winding number 0 .",
    "the transition from one of them to another can not proceed continuously .",
    "it should be a first order transition at a critical value of magnetic field accompanying with the discontinuity of net magnetization @xmath178 .",
    "it was reported in @xcite that such a transition indeed happens in a ferromagnetic ring : at a critical transverse field , the magnetization transits from the vortex state to the onion state .",
    "we will show that the magnetization in a tube also follows this scenario .",
    "the exact transition behavior to the onion state is still unknown .",
    "it may include the escape of the magnetization from @xmath185-plane .",

    "the basic equations of the table 1 show that , at @xmath84 , the transverse state has lower energy than the vortex state at zero field , and the more at any non - zero field .",

    "the transitional texture from the parallel to vortex magnetization can be imagined as half of the p1 type dw .",

    "but for the parallel state there can exist a stable half - dw structures at the edges of the tube if the radius and thickness are large enough .",
    "in an external field parallel to the tube in the vortex state no hysteresis appears , whereas the tube in the parallel state subject to the same field displays a rectangular hysteresis loop .",
    "when a field perpendicular to the tube axis is applied , the vortex state turns into the onion state at a critical field .",
    "this transition is accompanied by a jump of the magnetization .",
    "we also calculated the stray magnetic field generated by single magnetic tube and the periodic array of the tubes .",
    "it displays a singularity near the edges especially in strong external magnetic field .",
    "the singularities are partly smeared out by the edge domain walls at external magnetic field decreasing .",
