    "dynamical breaking of a symmetry can be described by a quantity known as the order parameter . in the case of a broken chiral symmetry",
    "a commonly used order parameter is the chiral condensate which vanishes if the chiral symmetry is unbroken .",
    "the investigation of the chiral condensate plays a crucial role in attempts to describe phase transitions related to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .    in qcd chiral condensate",
    "is obtained by numerical studies , as a rule via lattice simulations .",
    "this approach is usually employed in studies of the chiral condensate in the presence of external factors such as temperature , chemical potentials , magnetic field , finite size effects , etc ( see [ 1 - 3 ] and references therein ) .    apart from numerical studies there is a lot of models employed for the investigation of the chiral condensate in various physical systems @xcite , @xcite . in the first paper on this subject @xcite nambu and",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) analyzed a specific field model in four dimensions .",
    "later , the chiral condensate was studied by gross and neveu ( gn ) in two - dimensional spacetime in the limit of a large number of fermion flavors @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these two models are similar but in contrast to the njl model , the gn model is a renormalizable and asymptotically free theory . due to these properties",
    "the gn model is used for qualitative modeling of qcd .",
    "the relative simplicity of both models is a consequence of the quartic fermion interaction .    in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we investigated a system of a self - interacting massive scalar and a massless fermion field with the yukawa interaction in a @xmath1-dimensional spacetime . in the limit of a large mass of the scalar field",
    "the model becomes equivalent to the gn model .",
    "the chiral condensate was obtained by the functional integration using the method of the saddle point . for technical reasons the contribution of the scalar field fluctuations was not taken into account .",
    "this can be done if the coupling constant of the self - interacting scalar field is much less than the yukawa coupling constant .",
    "continuing our investigation of this model , we present in this paper a study of how the chiral condensate is affected by the quantum fluctuations of the scalar fields .",
    "the consideration of the quantum fluctuations allows one to find a phase transition in this model in a @xmath1-dimensional spacetime .",
    "apart from that , we also investigate the chiral condensate in a @xmath2-dimensional spacetime . in the limit of the massless scalar field in @xmath2 dimensions ,",
    "the chiral condensate is obtained in analytic form .",
    "we also find a phase transition in this setting .",
    "all results are obtained in the one - loop approximation framework .",
    "we consider a model with the lagrangian density given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a real scalar field , @xmath5 is a massless fermion field and the index @xmath6 runs from 1 to @xmath0 .",
    "the potential of the scalar field @xmath7 includes the mass term and the self - interaction @xmath8 of the scalar field .",
    "the potential @xmath9 is the yukawa interaction . @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a coupling constant .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq1 ] ) is invariant under the discrete transformation @xmath12 the symmetry ( [ eq3 ] ) is broken by the chiral condensate . in this paper",
    "we extend the calculation of the chiral condensate in this model performed in ref .",
    "@xcite to include the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field .",
    "we formally define the chiral condensate using the functional integral @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a normalization constant .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath15 @xmath16 to integrate over the scalar field one decomposes @xmath17 , where @xmath18 satisfies the classical equation of motion while @xmath19 describes small fluctuations around the classical background . in order to study the properties of the chiral condensate we choose a specific potential of the scalar field as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a coupling constant .",
    "then we take into account the quadratic terms of the scalar fluctuation @xmath19 and integrate over them , getting @xmath22 where @xmath23 . integrating over the fermionic field , we obtain @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a fermionic ultraviolet cutoff , @xmath26 is a ground state value of the bosonic field which is determined by the equations @xmath27 where @xmath28 , whereas @xmath11 and @xmath21 are dimensional coupling constants .",
    "it is convenient to introduce dimensionless constants @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a bosonic ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) may be written as @xmath31 and the saddle point @xmath26 is given by the solution of the equation @xmath32 where all the quantities are dimensionless .",
    "the third term in this equation describes the contribution of the scalar field fluctuations . generally speaking , eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) is resolved numerically , however , some special cases lead to simplifications that allow one to solve it analytically .",
    "an analytic solution can be easily compared with the results of our previous work @xcite , where the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field were not accounted for .",
    "we consider two such possibilities .",
    "\\i ) when @xmath33 , then @xmath34 and substituting @xmath26 in ( [ eq8 ] ) , we get @xmath35 to see that this solution coincides with that of ref .",
    "@xcite , we note that @xmath36 equals @xmath26 of that work ( see eq .",
    "( 15 ) there ) .",
    "\\ii ) when @xmath37 , then , rescaling @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , we get @xmath39 where @xmath40 using ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) , we obtain @xmath41 if @xmath42 , then the value of the chiral condensate given by eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) equals that of eq .",
    "( 13 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath43 is renormalization invariant .",
    "indeed , the @xmath44-functions in the one - loop approximation are @xmath45 using ( [ eq12 ] ) one can verify that @xmath43 does not depend on the choice of the renormalization point , i.e. @xmath46 it is worth to note that in a @xmath1-dimensional spacetime there is only one @xmath14-factor that appears in the renormalization of the scalar field mass , therefore @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the bare coupling constants , and @xmath50 , @xmath51 are the renormalized coupling constants .",
    "the relation in eq .",
    "( 13 ) can be obtained directly from the @xmath44-functions of eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) .    using eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) @xmath43 is rewritten as @xmath52 one can see that @xmath43 and the @xmath44-functions tend to zero in the limit @xmath53 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath44-function equals to zero then in the model there is a phase transition as shown in ref .",
    "therefore one can conclude that if @xmath54 is @xmath55 then there is a phase transition in the model .",
    "although @xmath43 is not a solution of the eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , @xmath43 also tends to zero when the @xmath44-functions tend to zero therefore @xmath43 may be considered as a qualitative approximation of @xmath26 .",
    "the value of @xmath43 becomes a good enough approximation of @xmath26 provided @xmath56 .",
    "the results of our numerical studies of the chiral condensate are presented in fig .",
    "1 . for the convenience",
    "the value @xmath57 is shown in this figure .",
    "we plot the value @xmath58 as a function of the yukawa coupling constant @xmath59 .",
    "the other parameters entering eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) take the values @xmath60 .",
    "since the chiral condensate falls sharply when @xmath54 tends to 1 , then @xmath58 is presented in different scales in fig .",
    "1 ( a , b ) . the solid line corresponds to @xmath26 obtained from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to @xmath26 obtained without the contribution of the scalar field fluctuations .",
    "the dash - dotted line is obtained for @xmath61 .",
    "we see that the chiral condensate equals to zero and the chiral symmetry is unbroken provided @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    "the chiral condensate appears when this condition is violated and increases with @xmath48 .",
    "hence there is a phase transition in this model . with increasing @xmath48",
    "the quantity @xmath43 becomes a good approximation of @xmath26 according to the corresponding condition @xmath56 .     as a function of the yukawa coupling constant @xmath59",
    "the values of parameters are @xmath60 .",
    "the solid line shows the chiral condensate where @xmath26 is an exact solution of eq .",

    "the dotted line is @xmath58 obtained without the contribution of the scalar field fluctuations .",
    "the dash - dotted line is @xmath58 obtained for @xmath61 . ]",
    "the method used above to calculate the chiral condensate is applicable in any dimension of space . therefore calculating @xmath62",
    "we get @xmath63 @xmath64 the quadratically divergent terms which appear in @xmath65 are eliminated by the mass renormalization .",
    "further we consider the case of a massless scalar field @xmath66 . rescaling the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath67 we rewrite the effective potential ( [ eq15 ] ) as @xmath68 or @xmath69 where @xmath70 note that @xmath43 is not a renormalization - invariant quantity .",
    "it is possible to check that by direct calculation , but it can be done in a simpler way .",
    "namely , we consider the following limiting cases    \\i ) @xmath71 , @xmath72 ,    \\ii ) @xmath73 , @xmath74 is not a renormalization - invariant quantity , we recall that @xmath75 .    in four dimensions the chiral condensate is defined as @xmath76 where @xmath26 is determined by the equations @xmath77 the effective potential @xmath78 has a minimum at @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in this case the chiral condensate is given by @xmath81 in the limit @xmath82 , @xmath43 tends to zero and consequently @xmath83 .",
    "if @xmath84 then @xmath62 has a maximum , the chiral condensate does not exist , and the chiral symmetry is unbroken .",
    "in this paper we studied the dynamical symmetry breaking in models consisting of a fermion field and a self - interacting scalar field with the yukawa interaction between the two fields in the one - loop approximation .",
    "we believe that the dynamical symmetry breaking as exhibited by these models can help to analyze similar phenomena in more realistic models .",
    "the models are considered in two and four spacetime dimensions .",
    "we showed that each models has two phases , one with the preserved symmetry and the other with the broken symmetry .",
    "we conclude that both models have a phase transitions as a function of the coupling constants . in four spacetime dimensions ,",
    "we obtain an analytic expression for the chiral condensate in the limit of a massless scalar field .",
    "the two - dimensional case was investigated numerically by solving of the algebraic equation for the scalar field .",
