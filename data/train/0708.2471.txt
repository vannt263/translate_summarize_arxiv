    "an intense activity has been devoted to the study of various field theories defined on moyal spaces ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these noncommutative field theories involve most of the features stemming from noncommutative geometry @xcite and are thus interesting in themselves .",
    "this interest was further increased by the observation that somewhat similar noncommutative field theories might emerge from some limiting regime of string theory and matrix theory in magnetic backgrounds @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this talk",
    ", i will report recent progress @xcite toward the construction of renormalisable actions for gauge theories defined on noncommutative moyal spaces which so far remains an unsolved and challenging problem .",
    "the corresponding results have been obtained in collaboration with a. de goursac and r. wulkenhaar @xcite .",
    "our results and conclusions agree with those obtained recently by h. grosse and m. wohlgennant , as reported in @xcite . in noncommutative geometry , the commutative algebras of functions defined on differentiable manifolds ( which may be viewed as modelling the coordinates spaces ) are replaced by associative algebras interpreted as algebras of functions on `` noncommutative spaces '' . within this algebraic framework , natural noncommutative analogues of the main geometrical objects usually involved in field theories can be defined thus opening the way for the construction of noncommutative analogues of field theories ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the relevant configuration spaces for the noncommutative field theories are modules over the associative algebras , naturally interpreted as noncommutative analogues for the set of sections of vector bundles , while the linear spaces of the derivations of these algebras can be viewed as the noncommutative counterparts of the spaces of vector fields of commutative spaces .",
    "this finally permits one to define natural noncommutative extensions of connections and curvatures @xcite .",
    "one example of associative algebra , among many others , is provided by the associative moyal algebras @xcite which will then play the role of `` noncommutative moyal spaces '' .",
    "note that moyal algebras have been considered in the mathematical literature a long time ago from various viewpoints ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is known that the simplest generalisations of scalar theories to moyal space suffer from the uv / ir - mixing @xcite , which makes the renormalisability very unlikely .",
    "recall that the uv / ir - mixing results from the existence of potentially dangerous non - planar diagrams which , albeit uv finite , become singular at exceptional low external momenta .",
    "this generates uv divergences in higher order diagrams in which they are involved as subdiagrams , signalling that that uv and ir scales are non - trivially related which should invalidate a wilson - type renormalisation scheme @xcite .",
    "an appealing solution to the uv / ir - mixing has been recently proposed by grosse and wulkenhaar @xcite within the noncommutative @xmath0 model ( @xmath1 real - valued ) on the 4-dimensional moyal space .",
    "they showed that the uv / ir - mixing can be suppressed by supplementing the initial action with a harmonic oscillator term leading to a renormalisable quantum field theory .",
    "the initial beautiful proof @xcite performed within the so - called matrix - base formalism was further simplified through a reformulation into the ( position ) @xmath2-space formalism in @xcite .",
    "other renormalisable noncommutative matter field theories on moyal spaces have then been identified .",
    "one is the complex - valued scalar theory studied in @xcite which is nothing but a modified version of the lsz model @xcite . as far as fermionic theories are concerned ,",
    "a moyal space version of the gross - neveu model @xcite ) , called the orientable noncommutative gross - neveu model , has been recently shown to be renormalisable to all orders @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this latter noncommutative theories still exhibit some residual uv / ir - mixing , even in the presence of the suitable extension of the harmonic term of @xcite , which however does not prevent the theory from being _",
    "perturbatively _ renormalisable .",
    "this indicates that further investigations are needed to clarify the actual role of various generalisations of the above - mentioned harmonic oscillator term , of the related covariance under the langmann - szabo duality @xcite and of their impact in the control of the uv / ir - mixing and renormalisability .",
    "so far , the construction of a renormalisable gauge theory on moyal spaces remains still unsolved and appears to be a quite challenging problem .",
    "the naive noncommutative extension of the pure yang - mills action on moyal spaces has uv / ir mixing @xcite which makes its renormalisability quite unlikely unless it is suitably modified .",
    "unfortunately , the `` harmonic solution '' proposed in @xcite can not be merely extended to gauge theories on moyal spaces .",
    "finding such a suitable extension would first amount to determine whether or not the naive noncommutative yang - mills action can be supplemented by additional gauge invariant terms providing a natural `` gauge theory counterpart '' of those harmonic terms .",
    "as shown in @xcite and as it will be explained during this talk , this can be conveniently achieved by computing at the one - loop order the noncommutative effective gauge theory action obtained by integrating out the matter degree of freedom of a matter field theory with harmonic term minimally coupled to an external gauge potential .",
    "the calculation performed within the @xmath2-space formalism singles out @xcite a class of gauge invariant actions given by @xmath3 that may well involve ( or may be used as a starting point to construct ) suitable candidates for renormalisable actions for gauge theory defined on moyal spaces .",
    "a similar investigation has been carried out independently by h. grosse and m. wohlgenannt @xcite .",
    "the corresponding basic ingredients ( gauge transformations and starting matter action ) and the computational tools ( related to the matrix basis ) are different from ours .",
    "but the resulting effective action and the related conclusions agree completely with ours . in , @xmath4 denotes a specific gauge covariant tensorial form , linked with the existence of a canonical gauge invariant connection @xcite appearing naturally within the present noncommutative framework .",
    "it is related to the so called covariant coordinates in the string theory literature ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "the 2nd term term built from the anticommutator and the 3rd term may be viewed as \" gauge counterparts  of the harmonic term introduced in @xcite ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are real parameters ) .",
    "furthermore , the 3rd term involves a mass term for the gauge potential while such a bare mass term for a gauge potential is forbidden by gauge invariance in commutative yang - mills theories .",
    "it turns out that the presence of these quadratic and quartic terms in @xmath4 is reflected in a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value for the gauge potential @xmath9 , a rather unusual feature for a yang - mills type theory .",
    "note that non trivial vacuum configurations have been studied recently in @xcite within scalar models with harmonic term .",
    "the consequences of this non - trivial vacuum for the above class of gauge theories remain to be understood and properly controlled in view of a further gauge - fixing of a ( classical ) gauge action stemming from combined with a suitable regularisation scheme .",
    "in this section , i collect some basic mathematical tools involved in the definition of the moyal algebra . the moyal product and the moyal spaces are deeply rooted in quantum mechanics through the operator calculus introduced by h. weyl @xcite .",
    "the subsequent formulation of quantum mechanics on a classical phase space was carried out in @xcite thanks to the introduction of a twisted product , hereafter called the moyal product product , together with the introduction of some analog of the quantum mechanical commutation relations , called the moyal brackets . for more mathematical details , see e.g @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "note that the moyal spaces can be related to spectral triples , as shown in @xcite . in the following",
    ", i will deal with four - dimensional moyal spaces .",
    "the extension to arbitrary ( even ) dimensional spaces is trivial .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote respectively the space of complex - valued schwartz functions on @xmath12 with fast decay at infinity and the space of tempered distributions on @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the invertible constant skew - symmetric matrix @xmath14 where @xmath15 has mass dimension @xmath16 .",
    "the associative moyal product , denoted hereafter by a @xmath17 symbol , can be first defined on @xmath18 by and @xmath19 is the fourier transform of @xmath20 @xmath21 for any @xmath22 such that @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25 . from , one easily verifies that @xmath26@xmath27@xmath28 , @xmath29@xmath30@xmath31 and @xmath32@xmath27@xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the complex conjugation , @xmath35@xmath24@xmath10 .",

    "however , it can be enlarged to an algebra of tempered distributions using duality of linear spaces such that the associativity of the @xmath17-product and the involution inherited from the complex conjugation are preserved ( see e.g @xcite ) .",

    "one of the most salient properties of the @xmath17-product is its non - locality which is obvious from .",

    "the associativity of the @xmath17-product extends easily on @xmath59 as a mere consequence of the definition of the moyal algebra together with the definition of the duality bracket .",
    "it is easy to realize that @xmath59 has a natural involution inherited from the complex conjugation operation acting on @xmath10 combined with the usual relation @xmath85@xmath27@xmath86 , @xmath49@xmath24@xmath11 , @xmath80@xmath24@xmath10 . in particular",
    ", the relation @xmath87=@xmath88 can be extended on @xmath59 .",
    "before presenting the main steps of the computation , it is useful to clarify the mathematical status of the various ingredients that will be involved , that is , matter fields , connections , gauge potentials , curvatures . for a larger amount of mathematical details , see e.g @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the framework presented below corresponds to the simplest option where the relevant module is chosen to be the algebra itself .",
    "it is also the most widely studied situation in the literature , giving rise to the so called `` noncommutative field theories on flat moyal spaces '' .",
    "this has been partly motivated because a similar noncommutative structure was suggested to emerge possibly from some limiting regimes of string theory and matrix theory in magnetic backgrounds @xcite .      in the following",
    ", the moyal algebra @xmath59 is assumed to be endowed with a differential calculus based on the derivations @xmath89 .",
    "the usual concept of connections defined on vector bundles in ordinary geometry can be consistently generalised in noncommutative geometry to connections on ( projective ) modules over an associative algebra .",
    "this is the route that will be followed here .",
    "let @xmath90 be a right @xmath59-module , equipped with a hermitian structure @xmath91 , i.e a sesquilinear map @xmath92 verifying @xmath93 a connection is defined algebraically by a linear map @xmath94 from @xmath90 to @xmath90 verifying : @xmath95 the connection is further assumed to preserve the hermitian structure , that is @xmath96 up to now , the module has not been specified except it has been assumed for definiteness to be a right @xmath59-module .",
    "the choice giving rise to the above mentioned noncommutative field theories corresponds to @xmath97 , that is , the algebra plays the role of the module .",
    "this is the most simple choice for @xmath90 which thus becomes a free module .",
    "the corresponding extension of the present material to the case @xmath98 is straightforward .",
    "the choice @xmath97 has an immediate consequence .",
    "since the relevant module involves now the unit , it follows from that the connection is entirely determined by its action @xmath99 on the unit @xmath100 , denoted by @xmath101 indeed , by setting @xmath102@xmath27@xmath56 in , one readily obtains @xmath103 this therefore can serve as defining a noncommutative analog of the gauge potential @xmath9 in @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , it can be realized that for @xmath97 , a hermitian structure is provided by @xmath104 which ensures that the above connections are hermitian connections provided @xmath105@xmath27@xmath9 .",
    "first recall that when @xmath106 , a morphism of module , says @xmath107 , satisfies by definition @xmath108 in the present situation , where @xmath109 is assumed , the gauge transformations hereafter denoted by @xmath107 are determined by the automorphisms of the module @xmath59 preserving the hermitian structure @xmath91 : @xmath110 is considered as a hermitian module over itself ] .",
    "namely , the gauge transformations must satisfy    @xmath111    it can be verified that the combination of with applied to @xmath112 implies automatically @xmath113 from this , it follows that the gauge transformations are entirely determined by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the group of unitary elements of @xmath116 .",
    "from now on , we set @xmath117 according to , the action of the gauge group as given above on any matter field @xmath118 can be defined by @xmath119 for any @xmath120 .",

    ", the transformations can not be viewed , strictly speaking , as gauge transformations which , by their very definition , must be related to morphisms of module .",

    "this will not be further considered in this talk .      in the present moyal framework",
    ", it turns out that the following relation holds @xmath145_\\star , \\quad \\xi_\\mu\\equiv-\\theta^{-1}_{\\mu\\nu}x_\\nu \\label{eq : inner - der}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] simply expressing the fact that the derivative @xmath89 in @xmath116 is an inner derivative .",

    "owing to the special role played by the coordinate functions @xmath65 through the invariant gauge potential @xmath146 involved in @xmath158 and , a natural choice for the minimal coupling prescription @xcite is obtained by performing the usual substitution @xmath159 in the considered action _ provided this latter",

    "@xmath89 _ and _ @xmath147 , using in particular the following identity : @xmath160 using , the minimal coupling prescription can be conveniently written as @xmath161 note that gauge invariance of the resulting action functional is obviously obtained thanks to the relation @xmath162 this prescription will be used in a while to couple the relevant matter action with harmonic term to an external gauge potential .",
    "up to now , i have recalled the main features of the moyal algebra @xmath59 within the relevant algebraic framework of noncommutative geometry .",
    "i have also assumed @xmath59 plays the role of the module so that we work with a simple free module from which are defined the fields and connections to be further used in some actions .",
    "let us briefly review some salient features of the present situation about renormalisable actions for matter .",
    "as far as i know , no firm guiding principle ruling the construction of actions on @xmath59 has been identified so far . in @xmath163@xmath27@xmath164 , a rather natural noncommutative analog of the commutative yang - mills action stemming from the connes - lott action functional @xcite , the spectral action principle @xcite is given by @xmath165 where @xmath166 is defined by",
    "this however can not be directly extended to the matter actions .",
    "nevertheless , the expression suggested in the old days the following simple recipe : naive noncommutative candidates for matter actions on @xmath59 may be obtained by replacing all the ordinary local of their commutative counterparts by non - local @xmath17-products .",
    "this procedure preserves the locality of the kinetic term since one has @xmath167@xmath27@xmath168 thanks to .",
    "but it turns any commutative local polynomial interaction into a non local interaction , as a consequence of the definition of the @xmath17-product .",
    "for instance , one has @xmath169",
    "@xmath170 where @xmath171@xmath52@xmath172 .",
    "the non locality of the interaction is responsible for the possible occurrencee of the uv / ir - mixing @xcite , that makes the renormalisability very unlikely .",
    "it results from the existence of dangerous non - planar diagrams which , albeit uv finite , become singular at exceptional ( low ) external momenta .",
    "this triggers the appearancee of uv divergences in higher order diagrams in which they are involved as subdiagrams , signallingg that uv and ir scales are related in a non - trivial way which should in principle invalidate a wilson - type renormalisation scheme @xcite .",
    "consider for instance the action for the real - valued scalar @xmath0 theory in @xmath163@xmath27@xmath164 : @xmath173    the one - loop tadpole part of the two - point function involves two contributions .",
    "the planar diagram contribution is @xmath174@xmath175@xmath176 and exhibits the expected uv divergence in four dimensions .",
    "however , the non planar contribution is @xmath177 where @xmath178@xmath52@xmath179 , the exponential oscillating factor in the integrand comes simply from the non locality of the vertex and @xmath180 denotes the modified bessel function of rank 1 ( @xmath181 is the external momentum ) .",
    "although this latter contribution is uv finite , it exhibits an infrared singularity , since one has @xmath182@xmath175@xmath183 for @xmath184 which holds thanks to @xmath185@xmath175@xmath186 for @xmath2@xmath187@xmath188 .",
    "this implies that , if @xmath189 denotes some uv cut - off used to regularise the ultraviolet behaviour of the integrals , the two limits @xmath189@xmath187@xmath190 and @xmath181@xmath187@xmath188 do not commute .",
    "this is , in essence , the uv / ir mixing phenomenon first exhibited in @xcite .",
    "moreover , such a tadpole triggers theappearancee of uv divergence in higher order diagrams in which it is involved as a subdiagram .",
    "this divergence is non local and therefore can not be absorbed into a mass redefinition so that the scalar model is not a priori renormalisable .",
    "a somehow similar conclusion applies to the naive noncommutative extension of the yang - mills action indicating clearly that some principle(s ) should supplement or replace the initial naive recipe .",
    "as far as i know , two possible solutions have been identified so far , each having its own merits and drawbacks . in the rest of this talk ,",
    "i will focus only on the `` harmonic solution '' proposed by grosse and wulkenhaar @xcite .",
    "the second possible solution is related to the so called twisted noncommutative field theories ( for more details see e.g @xcite and references therein ) .    in @xcite , grosse and",
    "wulkenhaar showed that the uv / ir - mixing of can be suppressed by supplementing the initial action with a harmonic oscillator term leading to a renormalisable noncommutative quantum field theory .",
    "this is the `` harmonic solution '' .",
    "the modified action is ( @xmath191@xmath27@xmath192 ) @xmath193 where @xmath194@xmath24@xmath195 @xmath196 $ ] for reasons given below .",
    "the actual interpretation of the harmonic term is so far not quite clear .",
    "the initial beautiful proof for the renormalisability of has been carried out within the matrix - base formalism . basically , using the fields expansion in the matrix - base , one maps onto an infinite - dimensional complex - valued matrix model .",
    "the technical key point is the computation of the propagator as the formal inverse of an infinite dimensional matrix in terms of the meixner polynomials . by further combining the propagators to the renormalisation group machinery with sharp bounds put on the matrix indices and using the wilson - polchinski equations , one",
    "can then prove @xcite that the modified action is renormalisable to all orders .",
    "the introduction of the harmonic term produces in some sense a kind of infrared cut - off in the theory and allows the uv and ir scales to decouple .",
    "it turns out that is covariant under a duality transformation @xcite , sometimes called the `` langman - szabo '' duality ( ls duality ) . roughly speaking",
    ", this expresses the fact that the form of is , up to rescaling factors , not altered through @xmath197@xmath198@xmath89 .",
    "the ls duality is defined is the cyclic fourier transform of @xmath199 given by @xmath200@xmath27@xmath201 ; the coordinates appearing in cyclic order in the quartic interaction are labelled as @xmath202 , @xmath203@xmath27@xmath204 and similarly for the momenta @xmath205 by @xmath206 which applied on the action yields @xmath207 so that @xmath194 can be consistently restricted to @xmath194@xmath24@xmath195 @xmath196 $ ] .",
    "note that is invariant for @xmath194@xmath27@xmath208 .",
    "so far , the requirement of ls duality has been helpfull to construct other renormalisable actions for complex - valued scalar fields . however , more investigations are needed to clarify the actual role of the l - s duality @xcite in the control of the uv / ir - mixing and renormalisability . while it is obvious that the implementation of ls - duality can be easily achieved within matter actions with polynomial interaction terms , the situation changes drastically for yang - mills type theories as it will be shown in the next section .",
    "let us now recall the main features of most of the presently known renormalisable field theories defined on moyal spaces .",
    "note that interesting solvable noncommutative scalar field theories have been considered in @xcite to which i refer for more details .",
    "the corresponding classical action , covariant under the ls - duality , is @xmath209 @xmath157 is a complex scalar field with mass @xmath102 , the parameters @xmath194 and @xmath210 are dimensionless and the term involving @xmath194 is the ( complex - valued ) scalar counterpart of the harmonic oscillator term .",
    "the interaction term @xmath211 is @xmath212 it turns out that restricted to @xmath213 ( @xmath7@xmath27@xmath188 ) is renormalisable for any value of @xmath194 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of the inclusion of @xmath214 on the renormalisability is not known .",
    "however in that latter case , it can be shown @xcite that a term @xmath175 @xmath215 is induced at the one - loop order whose coefficient is such that it `` completes the square in the quadratic part '' : the quadratic part of the action can then be cast into the form:@xmath175@xmath216@xmath217 @xmath218 where @xmath5 is some constant .",

    "the relevant configuration spaces for field theories are modules over these associative algebras , interpreted as noncommutative analogues for the set of sections of vector bundles , while the linear spaces of the derivations of these algebras can be viewed as the noncommutative counterparts of the spaces of vector fields of commutative spaces .",
    "this permits one to define natural noncommutative extensions of connections and curvatures @xcite .",
    "the particular situation considered in this talk corresponds to the free module case , the most widely studied case in the literature , where the algebra @xmath59 is viewed as a hermitian module over itself .",
    "then , the noncommutative analogue of gauge transformations are associated with the automorphisms of hermitian modules .",
    "the fact that @xmath59 has only inner derivations implies the existence of a canonical gauge - invariant connection @xcite from which a natural tensorial form can be defined .",

    "this is what we actually obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is known from general arguments of quantum field theory that a valuable information about the possible form for gauge actions can be extracted from those effective gauge actions obtained by integrating over the matter degrees of freedom of a matter action coupled in a gauge invariant way to an external gauge potential .",
    "so , we started from , says @xmath259 , a renormalisable complex - valued scalar field theory with harmonic term @xcite , minimally coupled to an external gauge potential .",

    "independently of our analysis , h. grosse and m. wohlgennant have recently carried out a nice calculation within the matrix - base @xcite of the one - loop effective gauge action obtained from a scalar theory with harmonic term different from ours , extending a previous work @xcite dealing with the limiting case @xmath296 .",
    "the scalar theory considered in @xcite is somehow similar to the one that one would obtain by considering `` covariant derivative '' as given in with symmetry transformations as those given by .",
    "it can be easily verified that our effective action agrees globally with the one given in @xcite , up to unessential numerical factors . for more details , see m. wohlgennant s talk at this conference .",

    "these additional terms are gauge invariant thanks to the fact that , as a tensorial form , @xmath4 transforms covariantly under gauge transformations .",

    "the fact that the tadpole is non - vanishing ( see ) is a rather unusual feature for a yang - mills type theory .",
    "this non - vanishing implies automatically the occurrence of the mass - type term @xmath299 as well as the quartic term @xmath300 .    it is tempting to conjecture that the following class of actions ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are parameters ) @xmath301 involves suitable candidates for renormalisable actions for gauge theory defined on moyal spaces .",
    "the naive action for a yang - mills theory on the moyal space , @xmath302 , taken alone , has uv / ir mixing @xcite .",
    "in , the second term built from the anticommutator may be viewed as a `` gauge counterpart '' of the harmonic term . according to the above discussion",
