    "protoplanetary discs are planet formation sites .",
    "we observe the electro - magnetic radiation from the discs to understand their physical conditions , and then , to know the planet formation , especially , its beginning .",
    "property of the radiation from a disc is essentially determined by the structure of the disc .",
    "the structure follows the response of the disc to the radiation from the central star . to interpret the radiation from protoplanetary discs , therefore",
    ", we should have a robust link between the radiation from the central star and the disc structure , in particular , the temperature structure .",
    "the temperature structure of the discs is also essential for chemical reactions in the discs .",
    "the evolution of various molecules in the discs and the exchange of these molecules between the gas phase and the solid phase on grains will be discussed in detail with the alma in near future ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the condensation front of icy molecules , so - called snow line , is also determined by the temperature structure of the discs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the location of the snow line is very important because it significantly enhances the amount of solid materials to make planetary cores and affects the supply of water to rocky planets .",
    "the temperature structure also affects the evolution of the discs themselves .",
    "the accretion activity in the discs is supposed to be driven by the magnetorotational instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this requires a certain degree of the ionization of disc materials which depends on the structure of the discs .",
    "a milestone in the research of the vertical temperature structure of protoplanetary discs is the work by @xcite ( hereafter cg97 ) .",
    "they proposed a two - layer model consisting of the super - heated layer directly exposed by the stellar radiation and the interior warmed by the super - heated layer .",
    "this model explained the shape of the spectral energy distribution of the discs very well .",
    "the computational cheapness of the analytic approach makes the cg97 model very useful to compare with a large sample of the discs observed .",
    "therefore , some attempts to refine the simple model of cg97 were performed @xcite .    despite a great success of",
    "the cg97 model , numerical simulations of the radiation transfer in the discs showed a significant decrement of the equatorial temperature relative to the prediction by the cg97 model @xcite .",
    "the internal energy loss by the radiation at a long wavelength where the optical depth of the disc is relatively small is suggested as a cause of the decrement @xcite . in the cg97 model and refined ones ,",
    "the wavelength dependence of dust opacity was taken into account in terms of mean opacity .",
    "@xcite argued the importance of using full wavelength dependent opacity .",
    "however , we propose an alternative approach in this paper : a three - layer model with mean opacity which reproduces the temperature reduction quite well . in addition",
    ", we show that the two - layer approximation in the cg97 model is valid only when the dust opacity is `` grey '' which is expected if the size of dust grains is larger than about 10 .",
    "effect of scattering on the vertical temperature structure was not considered in the literature very much .",
    "scattering of the stellar radiation was taken into account analytically by @xcite and numerically by @xcite who showed that the temperature of the disc interior is slightly reduced by the scattering .",
    "how about scattering of the diffuse disc radiation ? as the size of grains increases , the scattering albedo increases .",
    "in particular , the albedo of large icy grains is close to unity even for the infrared wavelength .",
    "this may affect the disc structure significantly .",
    "nevertheless , it has not been examined so far .",
    "this paper discusses the effect of scattering of the diffuse radiation as well as that of the stellar radiation on the vertical temperature structure of protoplanetary discs .",
    "since the albedo depends on the grain size , we examine the scattering effect as a function of the grain size .",
    "although there are 2-d/3-d numerical radiation transfer codes available publicly , most of them have a serious difficulty in solving the radiation equilibrium in very high optical depth ( @xmath2 ) found in protoplanetary discs @xcite .",
    "the radical developed by @xcite can solve such a problem without any difficulty thanks to a variable eddington tensor method .",
    "however , it treats scattering of only the stellar radiation .",
    "we present a variable eddington factor code with both scatterings of the stellar radiation and of the diffuse radiation but in a 1-d geometry .",
    "we also present an analytic model to interpret the numerical results .",
    "this simple model would be very useful to understand the physics determining the temperature structure of protoplanetary discs .",
    "the rest of this paper consists of three sections ; in section 2 , we develop a numerical radiation transfer code taking into account both of the scatterings but only for isotropic case and show the obtained numerical solutions . in section 3 , we construct an analytic model to interpret the numerical solutions and discuss the physical mechanism determining the temperature structure in protoplanetary discs . in the final section ,",
    "we summarise our findings .",
    "our method is an extension of the variable eddington factor method developed by @xcite ; we include isotropic scattering of the diffuse radiation as well as that of the stellar radiation .",
    "a disc is divided into many annuli in which the transfer of the diffuse radiation is treated one - dimensionally along the normal axis of each annulus with neglecting the radiation energy transport among annuli .",
    "this approximation , so - called 1 + 1d approximation , would be reasonable in an optically thick disc , but not at the near of the disc inner edge nor in a self - shadowing region ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the radiation from the central star is separated from the diffuse radiation and is treated with the so - called grazing angle recipe . in this paper , we only consider some single annulus cases in order to feature the effect of the scattering on the temperature structure along the normal axis of the annulus .",
    "therefore , we assume a grazing angle @xmath3 radian throughout of the paper .",
    "the density structure along the normal axis of the annulus is solved to be consistent with the obtained temperature structure assuming the hydrostatic equilibrium . in appendix",
    "a , we describe how to obtain the numerical solution of the diffuse radiation transfer with isotropic scattering in each annulus in detail .      .",
    "we show seven cases of grain size from 0.01  to 1 cm.,width=264 ]    we adopt a very simple dust model in order to feature the effect of scattering on the temperature structure .",
    "the absorption and scattering cross sections per unit gas mass at the wavelength @xmath4 are assumed to be @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the single scattering albedo at the wavelength @xmath4 is @xmath7 the critical wavelength @xmath8 may be related to a typical grain radius @xmath9 as @xmath10 .",
    "if we consider a spherical grain composed of uniform material , the absorption cross section is expressed as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the absorption cross section normalised by the geometrical cross section @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the grain material density , and @xmath15 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio . with the values of @xmath16 ( solar system nebula ) , @xmath17 g @xmath18 ( silicate ) , and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , we obtain the absorption cross section for small wavelengths as @xmath21 the scattering cross section can be given by the single scattering albedo for small wavelengths : @xmath22 . in this paper",
    ", we consider three cases of @xmath23 ( no scattering ) , @xmath24 , or @xmath25 .",
    "the values of @xmath26 for the last two cases may be extreme but such a large albedo is expected for icy grains in some wavelengths .",
    "figure  1 shows planck means of the absorption cross section and the scattering albedo assumed in this paper as a function of the temperature input into the planck function . in the panels , we show seven cases of grain size from 0.01  to 1 cm .",
    "we note that the absorption cross section and the scattering albedo become independent of the temperature , i.e. `` grey '' , when the temperature exceeds a critical one which depends on the grain size , corresponds to the critical wavelength @xmath8 , and is roughly expressed as @xmath27 k. in this paper , we do not consider the size distribution of the dust grains .",
    "thus , the `` grain size '' of this paper means a typical grain size averaged over a size distribution function with a weight .",
    "we here show the results of the annulus with the radius of 1 au obtained from our numerical radiation transfer in figures 2 and 3 . the results with other radii",
    "have been confirmed to be the same qualitatively .",
    "the gas column density is assumed to be @xmath28 g @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the radial distance from the central star",
    ". the properties of the central star assumed are the effective temperature @xmath31 k , the radius @xmath32 @xmath33 , and the mass @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "other assumed parameters are as follows : the grazing angle @xmath3 , the visible fraction of the stellar photosphere at the annuli @xmath36 , and the mean molecular weight @xmath37 .",
    "figure  2 shows the vertical temperature structures of annuli with 1 au radius with various grain sizes .",
    "we take a coordinate of the planck mean extinction optical depth with the stellar effective temperature as the horizontal axis . note",
    "that the maximum optical depth in each curve occurs the equatorial plane .",
    "the grain sizes assumed are shown in each panel .",
    "the solid , dotted , and dashed curves are the cases of no scattering ( i.e. @xmath23 ) , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively .    for no scattering cases ( solid curves ) , the so - called two - layer structure proposed by cg97 is confirmed .",
    "the dust temperature near the surface is enhanced due to the direct stellar radiation : `` super - heated layer '' .",
    "the thickness of the super - heated layer is well expressed by the planck mean extinction optical depth as @xmath40 ( grazing angle ) .",
    "the temperature rapidly decreases if @xmath41 .",
    "if the interior is optically thick against its own radiation , then , the interior reaches the thermal equilibrium and becomes isothermal . as the grain size becomes larger , the temperature of the super - heated layer becomes lower .",
    "in contrast , the temperature of the interior becomes higher .",
    "the physical reason of this phenomenon will be discussed in section 3 with two analytic models : the standard two - layer model like cg97 and a newly developed three - layer model .",
    "here , we just mention the fact that the numerical results agree with the prediction by the three - layer model for the grain size of 0.011 , whereas the results agree with that by the two - layer model for the size @xmath0 .    when there is scattering , some differences appear . for @xmath42 ( panel [ a ] ) ,",
    "the scattering albedo @xmath43 is negligible in the wavelength interest ( e.g. , an effective temperature less than @xmath31 k in figure  1 ) .",
    "thus , scattering virtually has no effect . for @xmath44  ( panel [ b ] ) , @xmath43 for",
    "the stellar radiation is significant , but that for the diffuse radiation in the annulus ( its effective temperature is less than about 300 k ) is still negligible ( see figure  1 ) . in this case , the temperature at the equatorial plane becomes slightly lower than that in the no scattering case , which is consistent with @xcite . for @xmath4510  ( panels [ c , d ] ) ,",
    "@xmath43 becomes significant for the radiation of the super - heated layer . in this case",
    ", we observe a plateau like structure at around @xmath46 and a significant reduction of the equatorial temperature . for @xmath47 1 mm ( panels [ e , f ] ) , finally , @xmath43 becomes `` grey '' for all the radiation considered here . in this case",
    ", the temperature structure with scattering becomes indistinguishable from that without scattering ; a `` grey '' scattering has no effect on the temperature structure in the optical depth coordinate .",
    "the physical reasons of these features will be discussed in section 3 with an analytic model .    even when the `` grey '' scattering , we find a difference of the temperature structures with / without scattering if we take the physical height as the coordinate as shown in figure  3 .",
    "the diamonds in figure  3 indicate the lower boundary of the super - heated layer , at which the planck mean extinction optical depth with the stellar effective temperature ( @xmath31 k ) is equal to the grazing angle .",
    "we find that with scattering , the height of the super - heated layer is always enhanced ; scattering causes more flaring disc ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the scattering may affect the global structure of the disc , which will be discussed in a future work .",
    "in order to understand the numerical results presented in the previous section , we here develop an analytic model as an extension of the seminal two - layer model by cg97 : three - layer model with scattering . to describe fluxes across the boundaries of the layers ,",
    "we adopt a two - stream eddington approximation with isotropic scattering .",

    "we need an iterative procedure because @xmath120 depends on @xmath68 .",
    "figure  5 first shows that the scattering hardly affect @xmath68 as expected by the analytic model .",
    "indeed , the cases of the three different albedos are superposed for almost all grain sizes , although a temperature enhancement of a few percent is observed in the scattering cases at a grain size of 0.11 .",
    "figure  5 second shows that the numerical solutions can be divided into two cases : higher temperature for smaller grain size ( @xmath121 ) and lower temperature for larger grain size ( @xmath122 ) , which is also expected by the analytic model .",
    "the agreement between the numerical solutions and the analytic model is excellent although the numerical solutions give about 3% higher temperature than the analytic model .",
    "this small difference is probably caused by neglecting the absorption of the interior radiation in the super - heated layer in the analytic model .",

    "this threshold is rather arbitrary , but we find that this choice is good as seen in figure  7 where the connected analytic models reproduce the numerical solutions reasonably well .",

    "nevertheless , the numerical solutions show a factor of @xmath158 reduction of @xmath102 for small grain cases .",
    "this is excellently explained by the three - layer model as found in equation ( 31 ) .",
    "the physical explanation is as follows : when the grain size is small , the radiation flux from the super - heated layer is absorbed by the middle layer once .",
    "then , the middle layer emits a half of the absorbed energy downwards but the rest of the half goes upwards .",
    "therefore , the interior does not receive a half of the stellar radiation energy absorbed by the super - heated layer but receive only a quarter of the energy when the grain size is small .    when there is isotropic scattering , we find further reduction of @xmath102 in a range of the grain size @xmath4410 or 100 . for @xmath192 , the scattering effect is not observed because of negligible albedo . for @xmath179100 , the scattering effect",
    "is not observed , either ( but except for the optically thin cases ) .",
    "this is nicely explained by the two - layer model with grey isotropic scattering as found in equation ( 25 ) .",
    "the physical reason is that the grey isotropic scattering equally reduces the downwards flux from the super - heated layer ( eq .  [ 19 ] ) and the upwards flux from the interior ( eq .  [ 15 ] ) .",
    "the reduction of @xmath102 due to scattering for @xmath4410   is explained by the three - layer model as summarised in equations ( 32 ) , ( 33 ) , and ( 34 ) .",
    "the physical reason of the @xmath102 reduction is that the scattering reduces only the downwards fluxes from the super - heated layer and from the middle layer because the scattering albedo at the frequency of the interior radiation is still negligible .",
    "we have examined the effect of scattering of the diffuse radiation on the vertical temperature structure of protoplanetary discs .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that scattering albedo increases as the size of dust grains grows in the discs .",
    "in particular , large icy grains have a significant albedo even in the infrared wavelength . for this aim ,",
    "we have developed a 1d plane - parallel numerical radiation transfer code including isotropic scattering of the diffuse radiation as well as that of the incident radiation .",
    "we have also developed an analytic model with isotropic scattering both of the diffuse and the incident radiations in order to interpret the solutions obtained from the numerical simulation .",
    "all results of the numerical simulations has been nicely reproduced by the analytic model .",
    "the analytic model presented in this paper is an extension of the seminal two - layer model by @xcite ; we have introduced a new layer between the super - heated surface layer and the disc interior . this middle layer ( or disc atmosphere )",
    "is required when the absorption of the radiation from the super - heated layer occurs well above the photosphere of the opaque isothermal interior .",
    "this situation is realised if the dust opacity is negatively proportional to the wavelength .",
    "thus , we should consider three layers rather than two layers if the grain size is smaller than about 10 . on the other hand , for grey opacity ,",
    "which is realised if the grain size is @xmath0 , the standard treatment with two layers is justified .",
    "we have found from the numerical simulation that the dust temperature of the disc surface is almost not affected by scattering .",
    "this is because the temperature is determined by the radiation equilibrium of grains in the incident radiation field locally .",
    "the grain size has an effect on the surface temperature via the wavelength dependence of the dust opacity .",
    "there are two asymptotic temperatures : the higher temperature is realised by small grains ( @xmath193 ) and the lower temperature is realised by large grains ( @xmath19410 ) .",
    "this is because the emission efficiency relative to absorption efficiency of the small grains is smaller than that of the large grains which have grey opacity .",
    "this trend of the numerical solutions is excellently reproduced by the analytic model of the super - heated layer .    the numerical simulations without scattering show that the dust temperature of the optically thick interior also has two asymptotic values : the lower temperature for small grains ( @xmath193 ) and the higher temperature for large grains ( @xmath0100 ) .",
    "thus , the trend is opposite from the surface temperature .",
    "the higher asymptotic temperature for large grains is well matched with the prediction of the two - layer model . on the other hand , the lower asymptotic temperature for small grains is a factor of @xmath158 lower than the prediction of the two - layer model .",
    "in fact , the flux input from the super - heated layer is always same although the interior temperature is different as a function of the grain size .",
    "this phenomenon has been already found by @xcite who attributed it to the energy loss from the interior by the radiation at a long wavelength ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we have proposed another interpretation by the middle layer between the super - heated layer and the interior ; the super - heated layer gives a half of the absorbed energy of the incident radiation to the middle layer which gives a half of the obtained energy to the interior .",
    "this three - layer model exactly predicts a factor of @xmath158 reduction of the interior temperature for the small grain case .",
    "the numerical simulations with isotropic scattering also show two asymptotic temperatures of the interior .",
    "interestingly , these asymptotic temperatures of no scattering and isotropic scattering cases are the same . for small grains ( @xmath193 ) , since the scattering albedo is negligible for all wavelengths interest , the same temperature is trivial .",
    "the same temperature for large grains ( @xmath0100 ) has been nicely explained by the two - layer model with grey opacity .",
    "the physical mechanism is the exact offset between the reduction of the flux input into the interior by scattering in the super - heated layer and the reduction of the flux output from the interior by scattering in itself ( i.e. green - house effect ) .    for grain sizes of 0.110 , which are expected by a moderate growth of the size in the discs",
    ", we have found a further reduction of the interior temperature in isotropic scattering cases relative to that without scattering from the numerical simulations .",
    "this reduction has been well explained by the three - layer analytic model .",
    "the physical mechanism is the wavelength dependence of albedo ; the flux input into the interior is reduced by scattering in the super - heated and middle layers , whereas the flux output from the interior is not reduced because of negligible ( or weak ) scattering . note that the interior flux has a longer wavelength typically , thus , the albedo for the radiation is smaller .    in conclusion",
    ", the scattering of the diffuse radiation can affect the vertical temperature structure of protoplanetary discs significantly when the grain size grows to be about 110 .",
    "we need to investigate the effect in a global disc model in future .",
    "the analytic model presented in this paper could be useful to understand the physics determining the temperature structure in the discs .",
    "we would appreciate comments from the anonymous referee which were very useful for us to improve the quality of this paper .",

    "we here present our numerical radiation transfer method in a plane - parallel medium in detail .",

    "if not going back to the step ( ii )    in the following we describe the set of equations and assumptions and the result of a benchmark test .",
    "suppose an annulus clipped from a protoplanetary disk to be a plane - parallel medium .",
    "we set the coordinate @xmath196 as the vertical height of the medium .",
    "the origin @xmath197 is the equatorial plane of the annulus and we set a mirror boundary condition there . assuming the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , we obtain the density of gas in the medium @xmath198 consistent with the temperature structure @xmath199 which is assumed as an initial guess or is obtained by the previous step of the iteration .",
    "we assume that the gas temperature is the same as the dust temperature which is determined by the radiation equilibrium .",
    "this assumption is usually well established in the protoplanetary disc because the collision between gas particles and dust grains occurs enough frequently .",
    "the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium is given by @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the gas pressure and @xmath202 is the gravitational acceleration . in a protoplanetary disc ,",
    "the self - gravity of the disc is negligible relative to the gravity of the central star .",
    "thus , we have @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the gravitational constant , @xmath205 is the mass of the central star , and @xmath30 is the distance from the star ( or radius of the annulus considered ) .",
    "we have assumed @xmath206 .",
    "the gas pressure is given by the equation of state for the ideal gas as @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath209 is the proton mass , and @xmath210 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "then , equation ( a1 ) is reduced to @xmath211 if we integrate equation ( a2 ) from @xmath197 with a given @xmath199 , we obtain the functional shape of @xmath198 .",

    "the reason why we calculate @xmath198 and the relation between the optical depth and the vertical height @xmath222 is to see @xmath199 as shown in figure  3 .",
