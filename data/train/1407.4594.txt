    "in this paper we investigate a mechanism of controlling virtual processes occurring in a two - level atom strongly interacting with a single - mode quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "virtual processes here refer to excitation - number non - conserving processes due to counter - rotating terms in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "such processes are generally fast oscillatory with feeble amplitudes and therefore the employment of rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) is justified when studying the quantum dynamics under the framework of the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model  @xcite . in doing so",
    ", however , interesting physics of virtual processes is lost . to go beyond the jc model ,",
    "recent investigations have begun to turn to the ultrastrong coupling regime in which the vacuum rabi frequency is comparable to the atomic transition frequency and the field frequency .",
    "in such a regime , rwa is no longer valid and countering rotating terms can give rise to novel features such as quantum integrability  @xcite , asymmetry of vacuum rabi - splitting  @xcite , non - classical photon statistics  @xcite , superradiance transition  @xcite , and the spontaneous release of virtual photons  @xcite .",
    "in addition , counter - rotating terms can modify the collapse and revival dynamics  @xcite , and quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects  @xcite .",
    "we note that the realization of an ultrastrong coupling in natural systems is still a challenge  @xcite , although recent experiments have demonstrated ultrastrong coupling in artificial atomic systems with the vacuum rabi frequency being a moderate fraction of the field frequency  @xcite .",
    "therefore an interesting question is how to enhance the counter - rotating terms or the corresponding virtual transitions without increasing the coupling strength to the ultrastrong coupling regime .",
    "one possible solution is to use a fast modulation of the coupling strength such that counter - rotating terms are converted into co - rotating ones .",
    "this strategy has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite to generate quantum vacuum radiation , and it requires the coupling strength to oscillate at a frequency which is about twice the cavity field frequency .",
    "in this paper we indicate an alternative approach based on a sequence of phase kicks to the system .",
    "each phase kick corresponds to a unitary operation determined by the square root of the parity operator . as we shall see below , by repeatedly applying phase kicks to the system with a suitable time separation between successive kicks",
    ", we can strongly enhance a certain virtual transition for systems with an interaction strength far below the ultrastrong coupling regime .",
    "we point out that the enhanced virtual transition is induced by matching the phase of quantum evolution rather than the traditional energy - level resonance , and so a high frequency modulation of coupling strength is not required .",
    "interestingly , if the time between adjacent kicks is sufficiently short , counter - rotating terms can be significantly suppressed even in the ultrastrong coupling regime . in other words , states of different excitation numbers",
    "are dynamically decoupled .",
    "we note that dynamical decoupling have been studied extensively in the context of decoherence control  @xcite .",
    "our scheme here generalizes the concept by vitali and tombesi  @xcite in order to suppress unwanted transitions by counter - rotating terms .",
    "the problem is relevant to systems in the ultrastrong coupling regime in which the rabi oscillations are distorted appreciably . with our scheme",
    ", we can restore the jc dynamics effectively .",
    "to begin with we consider a two - level atom interacting with a single - mode cavity field .",
    "the system is modelled by the quantum rabi model with the hamiltonian @xmath1  @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the jc hamiltonian , and @xmath4 contains counter - rotating terms : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are annihilation and creation operators of the field mode , and the two - level atom has a ground state @xmath8 and an excited state @xmath9 so that @xmath10 is defined as usual .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 are atomic and cavity field frequencies respectively , and @xmath13 denotes the atom - cavity interaction strength which is half the vacuum rabi frequency . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on the near resonance system in which @xmath14 .",
    "the ground state of @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath15 which refers to a ground state atom in the vacuum field . for later purpose",
    ", we let @xmath16 be excited states of @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) with @xmath19 being the excitation number ( eigenvalues of @xmath20 ) , and @xmath21 ( - ) labelling the higher ( lower ) energy level of the doublet for a given @xmath19 .",
    "our strategy to control the effects of @xmath4 is to introduce a sequence of phase kicks to the system ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "each phase kick is described by the unitary operator @xmath22 : @xmath23,\\ ] ] which is realized in a duration @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that the system evolution during each phase kick is entirely due to @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the evolution operator of the system after @xmath25 phase kicks is given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 denotes duration of evolution under @xmath29 .",
    "schematic diagram of the evolution sequence . @xmath30 and @xmath22 denote the evolution governed by rabi hamiltonian and the phase kick within time interval @xmath28 and @xmath24 , respectively . ]",
    "we consider the regime @xmath31 in which the ground state of @xmath29 is well approximated by @xmath15 under rwa . however , by applying the sequence of phase kicks with @xmath28 properly chosen , we find that a system initially prepared in @xmath15 is no longer stable but to evolve to higher excited states of @xmath3 .",
    "note that the @xmath22 operator alone does not change the photon number and atomic excitations .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] in which the time - dependent state @xmath32 is calculated numerically , and the figure shows the time - dependence of occupation probabilities of @xmath15 and @xmath33 .",
    "we see that the system can make a transition to @xmath33 almost completely after some time , and this is impossible without applying the phase kicks .     and @xmath34 as a function of dimensionless time for the system under the influence of phase kicks .",
    "the lower figure is a magnified plot of @xmath35 .",
    "the initial state is @xmath36 .",
    "parameters are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 . ]    in order to visualize the dynamics of the phase - kicked system , we have plotted fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] in continuous time ( not only the discrete time @xmath41 ) .",
    "a detailed picture is displayed in the lower figure .",
    "we see that during each time interval when the system is governed by @xmath42 , the population of @xmath33 is fast oscillatory about a constant mean value .",
    "however , the action of @xmath22 can interrupt the phase of the oscillations in the way that the population of @xmath33 climbs up after each kick .",
    "this feature continues until the probability of @xmath35 is almost one .",
    "the timings of phase kicks are important to obtain the enhanced transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we plot the maximum probability @xmath43 for the states @xmath44 attainable as a function of @xmath28 . the sharp peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] indicate that @xmath43 are significant only at certain values of @xmath28 located at @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , where @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the ground state energy of @xmath3 .",
    "these ` resonance ' values of @xmath50 correspond to a phase matching condition that @xmath22 is switched on at the moment when @xmath51 reaches a turning ( maximal ) point , as illustrated in the lower figure of fig .",

    "parameters are @xmath57 , @xmath40 , @xmath39 . ]    having presented our numerical observations , we now provide a theory to explain the enhancement effect .",
    "specifically we consider the case of enhancing the transition from @xmath15 to @xmath58 ( @xmath53 ) with the required @xmath28 given by : @xmath59/\\delta_{s},\\label{eq : en1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is a non - negative integer and @xmath61 is a small constant angle . for definiteness ,",
    "let us first examine the @xmath62 case . as fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] suggests , the system is approximately confined to the subspace formed by @xmath15 and @xmath33 , therefore we shall discuss the dynamics in this subspace .",
    "the justification of such a two - level approximation will be seen later .    the evolution operator for each cycle",
    "@xmath63 can be obtained approximately by using first - order time - dependent perturbation theory in which @xmath4 is treated as a perturbation in the interaction picture defined by @xmath3 .",
    "to the first order of @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a constant phase , and @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 with @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 being the identity operator . in deriving @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heff ] ) , we have made the expansion exp@xmath72 .",
    "after @xmath25 phase kicks , the evolution operator in the two - level subspace is approximated by @xmath73 where the correction is @xmath74 which can be neglected if @xmath75 .",
    "now we see that @xmath67 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : heff]-[eq : u ] ) plays the role of an effective two - level hamiltonian governing the system evolution after each kick .",
    "in particular , the terms @xmath76 and @xmath77 act as an effective detuning and rabi frequency respectively .",
    "therefore , on one hand , @xmath78 corresponds to a resonance condition so that an initial @xmath15 state can be completely transferred to @xmath33 at the time @xmath79 , and this agrees with the exact result obtained by numerical calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ; on the other hand , @xmath80 corresponds to a large detuning situation in which the phase kicks have almost no effects on the system .",
    "this explains the resonance curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] because @xmath81 is related to @xmath28 . in particular , the sharp resonance peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] are located at @xmath28 corresponding to @xmath82 by eq .",
    "( [ eq : en1 ] ) , and the peak width is @xmath83 .    the theoretical analysis above can be applied to the @xmath84 transition by simply taking @xmath21 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : en1]-[eq : u ] ) , and this would yield a different set of resonance .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , the peaks associated with the @xmath84 transition ( blue dashed curve ) are well separated from those for the @xmath33 transition ( red curve ) , except for the @xmath85 case . to understand this ,",
    "let us choose @xmath28 at the exact resonance of the @xmath33 transition , i.e. , @xmath86 , then this value of @xmath28 is deviated from the resonance peak of @xmath84 of the same @xmath60 because @xmath87 . by eq .",
    "( [ eq : en1 ] ) with @xmath21 , the deviation is @xmath88 .",
    "such a @xmath81 acts like an effective detuning which increases with @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , for the parameter used in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , a large detuning condition @xmath89 is satisfied when @xmath90 , and hence the @xmath84 transition is suppressed when @xmath50 is taken to be at the resonance peak of the @xmath33 transition .",
    "this explains why peaks of different transitions in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] are more separated for higher @xmath60 s , which also justifies our two - level treatment in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heff ] ) .",
    "the case of @xmath85 involves a partial overlap of resonances , and it requires a multi - level treatment .",
    "however , the details of this special case will not be discussed here .",
    "in this section we show that the sequence of phase kicks can be used to suppress counter - rotating terms in the ultrastrong coupling regime if @xmath91 is sufficiently short .",
    "this is different from the previous section in which the values of @xmath28 considered in eq .",
    "( [ eq : en1 ] ) can be much longer than @xmath92 ( or @xmath93 ) .",
    "we begin by noting that the parity operator of the rabi model is given by @xmath94 which commutes with @xmath29  @xcite . by the fact that @xmath95 , we have @xmath96 , and so the evolution operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u1 ] ) with an even @xmath25 is : @xmath97 , since @xmath98= [ \\pi , p]=[\\pi , p^{\\dag}]=0 $ ] .",
    "next by @xmath99 , we have @xmath100 which indicates that the application of two successive phase kicks can alternatively change the sign of @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath28 is sufficiently small , we can make the following approximation up to the second order of @xmath28 : @xmath101 where @xmath102/2 $ ] .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath103 ( but keeping time @xmath41 fixed ) , we have @xmath104 , and @xmath105exp@xmath106 , i.e. , @xmath4 is completely suppressed . in this limit , the system is governed by an effective jc hamiltonian @xmath107 since @xmath41 is the total time .     for the cases : without phase kicks ( green dashed curve ) , with phase kicks using @xmath108 ( blue thin solid curve ) , and with phase kicks using @xmath109 ( red thick solid curve ) .",
    "the initial state is @xmath56 .",
    "other common parameters are @xmath40 , @xmath110 . ]    to illustrate the suppression effect , we resort to numerical calculations and show our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : pg0 ] .",
    "we consider the system in the ultrastrong coupling regime so that the effects of counter - rotating terms are prominent . with an initial state given by @xmath15 , fig .",
    "[ fig : pg0 ] shows the time - dependence of the probability of @xmath36 with and without phase kicks . because of the ultrastrong coupling , @xmath111 for the case without kicks is oscillatory and it",
    "is significantly deviated from one because of counter - rotating transitions . however , by applying the phase - kick sequence , we see that @xmath111 oscillation amplitudes are suppressed . in particular , @xmath112 for the case with a smaller @xmath50 ( red thick solid curve ) .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath36 is dynamically decoupled from the counter - rotating transitions .",
    "we also consider a different initial state given by @xmath113 , fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) shows the evolution without phase kicks .",
    "we see that the rabi oscillations between @xmath113 and @xmath114 are strongly modified by @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the sum of probabilities of @xmath113 and @xmath114 is not equal to one most of the time , which indicates that virtual transitions beyond @xmath113 and @xmath114 levels are significant . by using phase kicks [ fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b , c ) ] , we see that sinusoidal rabi oscillations are recovered .",
    "these oscillations agree well with the prediction by the effective jc hamiltonian @xmath115 described above .",

    "for example , in the resonance case of @xmath142 , @xmath22 can be achieved by switching off @xmath13 in a duration @xmath143 , where @xmath60 is a non - negative integer .",
    "we note that experimental progress of switchable coupling for systems under ultrastrong coupling has been made  @xcite , and there are also theoretical studies on the designs and effects of switchable coupling  @xcite .",
