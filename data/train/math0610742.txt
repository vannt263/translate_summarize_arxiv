    "for the sake of simplicity we will pay our attention mainly to cubic graphs ( or , in other words , to regular graphs of degree @xmath1 ) .",
    "this assumption is not restrictive since all our considerations remain valid for regular graphs of degree @xmath2 with obvious minor modifications .",
    "moreover , in a certain sense cubic graphs are the generic regular graphs ( see e.g. greenlaw and petreschi @xcite ) .",
    "so let us consider the set of all regular cubic graphs with @xmath3 vertices .",
    "they can be conveniently enumerated using the ` genreg ` program of markus meringer @xcite .",
    "each graph is completely determined by its adjacency matrix , which is symmetric .",
    "its spectrum ( the set of eigenvalues ) is real and lies on the segment @xmath4 $ ] . for each graph",
    "it can be found numerically . in the interests of statistical analysis",
    ", we might want to take the means and variances of each set of eigenvalues .",
    "however , since the diagonal entries of the adjacency matrices are zero ( graphs contain no loops ) , the eigenvalues sum to zero . in order to produce results with some variation , and originally motivated by solving systems of linear first order differential equations ,",
    "we take the exponential of the eigenvalues before finding their mean and variance . as a final modification , this time motivated by the authors interest in markov processes , we replace the adjacency matrix @xmath5 by the related doubly stochastic matrix @xmath6 .",
    "the theory of markov chains then states that the probability of being at the @xmath7th vertex after a walk of length @xmath8 in the graph with each edge equally likely to be chosen is the @xmath7th element of the vector @xmath9 , where the @xmath10th element of the vector @xmath11 is the probability of starting at the @xmath10th vertex .        summarizing , we apply the following procedure . for",
    "a fixed even @xmath3 find the adjacency matrices of all regular cubic graphs on @xmath3 vertices . in each case",
    ", divide the adjacency matrix by three , find its eigenvalues , take their exponential , and then find their mean and variance .",
    "each cubic graph is then represented by a single dot on a plot of mean versus variance .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of applying this procedure with @xmath12 , where the number of regular cubic graphs in each case is @xmath13 respectively .",
    "there appears to be a very definite structure in these plots . in each case",
    "the data appear in distinct clusters that at this scale look like straight line segments with roughly the same slope and distance separating them .",
    "( in the next section we will derive explicit formulas for these slopes and distances . ) due to their form , we would like to name these clusters by `` filars '' , whose dictionary meaning is `` threadlike objects '' .",
    "plot , width=491 ]    an even greater level of structure exists within each filar .",
    "figure 2(a ) repeats the results for @xmath14 , and figure 2(b ) zooms in on the leftmost filar .",
    "we can see that each filar is in fact made up of smaller clusters of approximately straight line segments , all roughly parallel and the same distance apart , with a steeper slope than the original one .",
    "we shall call each of these clusters a subfilar , and figure 2(c ) zooms in on the fourth subfilar from the left in figure 2(b ) .",
    "the structure continues in figure 2(d ) , which zooms in on the 5th subsubfilar of figure 2(c ) . since a fractal is defined as a self - similar image , where the same structure is evident when magnifying one part of the image , we see that these figures obviously enjoy a fractal structure .",
    "the larger the number of vertices , the more levels of magnification can be undertaken before the number of data points becomes small enough for the self - similar structure to be lost .",
    "collectively , we refer to this phenomenon as the `` multifilar structure '' of cubic graphs ( or their spectra , to be more precise ) .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that this behavior is not limited to cubic graphs .",
    "plots for quartic graphs ( every vertex of degree four ) show exactly the same structure . as we will see later",
    ", the ihara - selberg trace formula justifies the presence of such a fractal structure for regular graphs of arbitrary degree @xmath0 .",

discovered this property of regular graphs , the aim of the following section is to theoretically explain the ( multi)filar structure .",
    "before we resort to the theory based on the ihara - selberg trace formula @xcite , it is instructive to consider the case @xmath15 in detail . figure 3 shows all 19 regular cubic graphs with ten vertices , labelled in the order produced by ` genreg ` , and figure 4 repeats figure 1(b ) , but with labels on the data points indicating graph number .",
    "we can see a pattern in terms of which graphs are in each filar .",
    "graphs 19,18,16,17,15,14 in the first ( leftmost ) filar have no subcycles of length 3 , which we shall call triangles from now on . graphs 13,11,8 in the second filar have exactly one triangle , graphs 10,9,6,7,5 in the third filar have exactly two triangles , graphs 12,3 in the fourth filar have exactly three triangles , and graphs 4,2,1 in the fifth filar have exactly four triangles . focusing on the first filar , graphs 19,18,16,17,15,14 have exactly 0,2,3,5,5,6 subcycles of length 4 respectively .",
    "special emphasis should be given to the data points for graphs 17 and 15 .",
    "they are extremely close together , and have the same number of subcycles of lengths 3 and 4 ( 0 and 5 respectively ) .",
    "they only vary in number of subcycles of length 5 , numbering 0 and 2 .",
    "similarly , graphs 4 and 2 both have four 3-subcycles , two 4-subcycles , and only vary in the number of 5-subcycles ( two and four ) .",
    "these observations suggest that membership in a filar structure is related to the number of subcycles of various lengths in the original graph ",
    "although this does not explain why filars approximate straight lines .      to obtain qualitative and quantitave justification of the phenomenon in question we bring in a very explicit version of the ihara - selberg trace formula that is due to p. mnv , cf .",
    "@xcite , formula ( 30 ) .",
    "a general form of the ihara - selberg trace formula , as well as precise definitions can be found in appendix . for any regular graph @xmath16 of degree @xmath17 on @xmath3 vertices we have      here",
    "@xmath19 is the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of @xmath16 , @xmath20 runs over the set of all ( oriented ) primitive closed geodesics in @xmath16 , @xmath21 is the length of @xmath20 , and @xmath22 is the standard notation for the bessel function of the first kind :      all lengths @xmath21 are integers greater than or equal to 3 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath24 the number of _ non - oriented _ primitive closed geodesics of length @xmath25 in the graph @xmath16 .",
    "the numbers @xmath24 are called the _ multiplicities _ of the _ length spectrum _ of the graph @xmath16 , that is , the set of lengths of non - oriented primitive closed geodesics in @xmath16 ( the set @xmath26 describes the length spectrum of the graph in a unique and convenient way ) .",
    "the multiplicities @xmath27 are uniquely determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath16 and are given by explicit formulas ( cf . formula ( 34 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , we have @xmath28 etc .",
    "@xmath33 note that the factor of 2 at the sum appears because we forget about the orientation of geodesics and have to count each one of them twice .",
    "the latter series converges very fast because of the following well - known asymptotic behavior of @xmath22 :                    to start with , let us note that the function @xmath44 is positive for @xmath45 and decreases very rapidly when @xmath25 grows and @xmath46 remains fixed .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath47 is also positive for any positive integer @xmath48 and decreases very fast in @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , for any @xmath3 all the points with coordinates @xmath49 , corresponding to cubic graphs on @xmath3 vertices , lie above and to the right of the initial point @xmath50 in the mean vs. variance plane .",
    "moreover , we see that @xmath51 gives the leading terms in both sums in ( [ mean ] ) and ( [ variance ] ) .",
    "this means that the points @xmath49 accumulate just above the line parametrically described by equations @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mean and @xmath54 is the variance coordinates respectively .",
    "note that the slope of this line is approximately 7.079 .",
    "another byproduct of the above considerations is a necessary and sufficient condition for two graphs @xmath55 and @xmath56 to belong to the same filar : this happens if and only if the multiplicities @xmath57 and @xmath58 are equal , or , equivalently , @xmath55 and @xmath56 have equal number of triangles .",
    "the lines these filars approximate are given by parametric equations @xmath59 the horizontal distance between two filars that contain the points corresponding to @xmath55 and @xmath56 is proportional to @xmath60 and is approximately equal to @xmath61 for @xmath62 the approximate horizontal distances between the neighboring filars are 0.00181 , 0.00155 , 0.00136 , 0.00121 respectively",
    ". as one can easily see on figure 1 , filars actually get closer to each other as @xmath3 gets larger in proportion with @xmath63 .",
