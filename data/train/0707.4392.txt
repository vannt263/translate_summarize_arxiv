    "cold atomic gases strongly confined via optical lattice techniques along one or two dimensions and placed in an external magnetic field tuned near a feshbach resonance provide the exciting possibility to study low - dimensional ( low - d ) strongly correlated physics in a controllable fashion @xcite . for weakly interacting atoms in a transverse trap ,",
    "it is easy to get a low - dimensional hamiltonian by projecting the atomic wave function to the lowest trap mode .",
    "however , the situation gets much more complicated for strongly interacting atoms .",
    "it is known that virtual excitation of the transverse trap modes during the atomic collisions could lead to interesting renormalization of the atomic scattering lengths in low dimensions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , independent of the detuning from the feshbach resonance , the atoms can always form dimers ( two - body bound states ) as their ground state configuration in a transverse trap @xcite .",
    "because of the formation of dimers , the problem does not simply reduce to atomic scattering with a renormalized scattering length , but instead , we have to take into account the _ real population _ of the atoms in transverse excited levels , which remains significant even for an extremely strong transverse trap @xcite .    in this paper , we construct the low - d ( both 1d and 2d ) effective hamiltonian by taking into account the atomic population in the transverse excited modes .",
    "to describe the transverse excitations , one can introduce a dressed molecule @xcite , which is part of the dimer state excluding the atomic population in the lowest transverse level .",
    "we observe that for realistic atomic densities , the structure of the dressed molecule is largely fixed by the two - body physics and thus almost density independent .",
    "this allows us to derive the renormalized interaction between the atoms and the dressed molecules , which gives the effective many - body hamiltonian .",
    "this effective hamiltonian reproduces the correct two - body state , and from that , we also fix all the parameters in the hamiltonian at any detuning of the magnetic field .",
    "we consider an atomic gas free in @xmath0 dimensions ( @xmath1 ) and trapped by a ( @xmath2)-dimensional harmonic potential of frequency @xmath3 along the transverse direction .",
    "( a single well of the lattice potential can be well approximated with a harmonic trap . )",
    "we use the conventional two - channel field theory for feshbach resonance @xcite , although one could also use a single - channel approach with an energy - dependent pseudopotential @xcite . for atoms of mass @xmath4 possessing internal states @xmath5 , with contact interactions ,",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the atomic field operator and @xmath8 is the molecular field operator .",
    "above , and throughout this paper , we use dimensionless quantities with all energies in units of @xmath9 and all lengths in units of the trap length scale , @xmath10 .",
    "the dimensionless parameters are defined as follows : @xmath11 is the bare detuning ( in units of @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 is the bare atom - molecule coupling rate ( in units of @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 is the bare background atomic scattering rate ( in units of @xmath16 ) .",
    "the bare parameters are related to the physical ones via the standard renormalization relations : @xmath17where the subscript @xmath18 denotes physical parameters , @xmath19 , and the integral is taken in three dimensions with an explicit energy cutoff @xmath20 ( which finally goes to infinity ) imposed on two dimensions , so @xmath21 . the physical parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are determined from the scattering data as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the difference in magnetic moments between the two channels ) , where we have assumed that the s - wave scattering length near resonance has the form @xmath29 , with @xmath30 as the background scattering length , @xmath31 as the resonance width , and @xmath32 as the resonance point .    expanding the field operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 in terms of trap eigenmodes in the trapped dimensions and plane waves in the untrapped dimensions yields @xmath33where @xmath34 indexes trap eigenmodes @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 denotes the wave vector in the untrapped dimensions @xmath38 , @xmath39 . the operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 represent the corresponding atomic and feshbach molecular modes , respectively",
    "the plane wave energy @xmath42 and the mode energy @xmath43 are given by @xmath44 , @xmath45 [ for convenience we neglect the constant energy @xmath46 in @xmath43 as we will measure the two - body bound state energy with respect to the continuum threshold @xmath2 ] .",
    "@xmath48 is the dimensionless quantization length in the untrapped dimensions .",
    "the form factors appearing in eq . are given by @xmath49@xmath50with @xmath51where @xmath52 is the hermite polynomial .",
    "the above hamiltonian is extremely complicated and hard to solve directly .",
    "we expect it should reduce to some low - dimensional effective hamiltonian when the trap confinement is strong enough . in particular , we assume that the many - body energy scale , characterized by the density dependent part of the chemical potential @xmath53 , is much less than the trap energy @xmath12 .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the 1d ( or 2d ) atomic density @xmath54 measured in units of @xmath55  ( or @xmath56 ) , which is typically the case for realistic systems . under this condition ,",
    "when the atoms are far apart , they should stay in the transverse ground level to minimize the energy .",
    "the transverse excited levels get populated only when the atoms come close to strongly interact with each other . however , since @xmath57 and there is no @xmath58-particle bound state with @xmath59 for two - component fermions , it is rare for three or more atoms to come close ( two atoms can approach each other as there exists a bound dimer state at any detuning @xmath60 from the feshbach resonance @xcite ) . from this argument , we see that the atomic distribution in the transverse excited modes is determined by the short - range physics , where the latter is fixed through the two - body solution . the dimer state of the hamiltonian @xmath61 with binding energy ( relative to the continuum threshold , @xmath2 )",
    "@xmath62 and momentum @xmath63 can be written in the form @xmath64 , where @xmath65 denotes the vacuum and @xmath66 with the coefficients @xmath67 and @xmath68 given in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the actual expressions are not important for the purposes of this discussion .",
    "we thus construct the dressed molecular modes @xmath69 with the same expression as @xmath70 , but excluding the @xmath71 term in the summation ( correspondingly normalized ) .",
    "these modes @xmath69 capture the short - range physics and their structure should be basically independent of the atomic density .",
    "the coupling between @xmath72 and the atomic modes @xmath73 ( with a simplified notation as @xmath74 ) in the open channel can be approximated with a contact interaction since @xmath72 is tightly confined in space to a volume on the order of @xmath75 in the deep bcs regime and even smaller in the crossover and bec regimes @xcite .",
    "the general effective hamiltonian for @xmath72 and @xmath74 then takes the form @xmath76where @xmath77 ( in units of @xmath9 ) is the relative detuning , @xmath78 ( in units of @xmath79 ) is the coupling rate , and @xmath80 ( in units of @xmath81 ) represents the remaining background interaction in the open channel .",
    "we introduce the physical parameters related to three bare parameters in @xmath82 via a low - d renormalization analogous to eq . :",
    "@xmath83note that the zero - point energy @xmath2 appears explicitly in the definition of @xmath84 , otherwise there is an artificial infrared divergence .",
    "these definitions of the physical parameters are justified as we will see below that they remove exactly the ultraviolet divergence associated with the contact interaction .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath82 should reproduce the same physics represented by the 3d hamiltonian @xmath61 when the system is near the ground state with the energy per particle close to @xmath85 ( as @xmath86 in units of @xmath12 ) . to determine the parameters in @xmath82",
    ", we match the exact two - body bound state obtained from the original @xmath61 .",
    "specifically , we first determine the effective background scattering @xmath87 by matching the bound state physics in the deep bcs limit , where the population is entirely atoms in the lowest trap mode .",
    "then , for general detuning , matching the binding energy and the bound state gives two constraints which determine the remaining parameters , @xmath88 and @xmath78 . since the composition of the dressed molecule @xmath72 is a function of detuning @xmath60 , or equivalently , of the 3d scattering length , so are these two parameters .",
    "all the two - body physics contained in a given hamiltonian are embodied in its t - matrix , defined by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the interaction part of the hamiltonian @xmath61 , @xmath91 is the full two - body propagator , and @xmath92 is the free two - body propagator . physically , the matrix element @xmath93 is the sum of the direct process whereby a pair of atoms scatters from state @xmath94 to state @xmath95 and the indirect processes whereby the atoms scatter into an intermediate state , propagate with energy @xmath96 , and then scatter into the final state . from its definition , it is clear that the t - matrix has simple poles where @xmath96 is equal to a two - body bound state of the hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , the residue of the diagonal matrix element @xmath97 at such a pole , @xmath98 , is @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the noninteracting energy of state @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the residue of a given diagonal matrix element determines the fraction of the bound state in the given basis state .",
    "we shall use both of these facts in matching the two - body bound state properties of the exact and effective hamiltonians .    in the appendix",
    ", we derive the general two - body t - matrix associated with the hamiltonian @xmath61 in eq . .",
    "for a pair of atoms asymptotically in the lowest mode of the trap , the corresponding diagonal t - matrix element ( in units of @xmath101 ) as a function of the two - body energy @xmath96 ( measured with respect to the continuum threshold , @xmath2 ) is @xmath102 ^{-1}=\\gamma _",

    "we have used the gamma function @xmath107 and the hurwitz zeta function @xmath108 .",
    "the two - body bound state corresponds to a pole of the t - matrix element above with @xmath109 ^{-1}=0 $ ] at the binding energy @xmath110 , which gives the eigen - equation @xmath111 ^{-1}=s_{p}\\left ( e_{2b}\\right )   \\label{eq : energy}\\ ] ] to determine @xmath112 .",
    "also , as discussed above , the atom pair population of the lowest trap mode is determined by the residue of the above t - matrix element at this pole . since the bound state of",
    "the _ effective _ hamiltonian comprises only atom pairs in the lowest trap mode and dressed molecules , specifying the population in the lowest mode is sufficient , in conjunction with normalization , to determine the entire bound state of @xmath82 .",
    "thus , to ensure that the effective and the exact hamiltonians produce the same two - body bound state , we just need to obtain @xmath113 ^{-1}$ ] from both @xmath61 and @xmath82 , and require them to match to first order in @xmath114 .",
    "following the same approach as in the appendix , the corresponding t - matrix element from the effective hamiltonian @xmath82 is obtained as @xmath115 ^{-1}= \\left [ v_{p}^{\\text{eff}% } \\left ( e\\right ) \\right ] ^{-1}- \\gamma_{\\mathbf{000}}^{-2 } \\sigma _ { p}\\left ( e\\right ) , \\label{eq : teff}\\]]where @xmath116 ^{-1}\\equiv \\left [ v_{p}-\\alpha _ { p}^{2}/\\left ( \\lambda _ { p}-e\\right ) \\right ] ^{-1}=% \\left [ v_{b}-\\alpha _ { b}^{2}/\\left ( \\lambda _ { b}-e\\right ) \\right ] ^{-1}+v_{c}^{-1}$ ] , and the function@xmath117 \\notag \\\\ & = \\begin{cases } \\frac{-1}{4\\pi\\sqrt{-e}}+\\frac{1}{2^{5/2 } \\pi } & d=1 \\\\ \\frac{\\ln \\left ( -e\\right ) } { 2^{5/2 } \\pi^{3/2 } } & d=2% \\end{cases } \\label{eq : sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we require the effective background term alone to reproduce the two - body physics on the deep bcs side , where the dressed molecule population is negligible . matching eqs . and in that region",
    "yields @xmath118where @xmath119 . in this way",
    ", we obtain an effective single - channel model on the deep bcs side which recovers the low - energy scattering models of refs .",
    "however , the single - channel model with a renormalized scattering length @xmath120 is not adequate near resonance or on the bec side where the dressed molecule population becomes significant .    to fix the parameters @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    ", we compare the t - matrix in eqs . and at general detuning , and require them to match for the zeroth and the first orders in expansion with @xmath123 ( which are responsible for reproducing the same binding energy and the bound state , respectively ) .",
