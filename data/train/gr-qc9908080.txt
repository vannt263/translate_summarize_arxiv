    "latest years have seen increasing efforts devoted to the measurement of the general relativistic lense - thirring effect in the weak gravitational field of the earth by means of artificial satellites . at present , there are two main proposals which point towards the implementation of this goal : the gravity probe - b mission , and the approach proposed in which consists in using the actually orbiting lageos laser - ranged satellite and launching another satellite of lageos type , the lares , with the same orbital parameters of lageos except for the inclination which should be supplementary with respect to it . at present ,",
    "both these two satellites have not yet been launched : however , while the gp - b is scheduled to fly in 2002 , to date the lares mission has not been approved by any spatial agency .",
    "recently ciufolini has put forward an alternative strategy based on the utilization of the already existing lageos and lageos ii which could allow the detection of the lense - thirring drag at a precision level of @xmath0 . while the gp - b mission is focused on the gravitomagnetic dragging of the spin of a freely falling body , in the lageos experiment",
    "it is the whole orbit of the satellite which is considered to undergo the secular lense - thirring precession .",
    "more exactly , among the keplerian orbital elements the node and the perigee are affected by the gravitomagnetic force . for lageos and lageos",
    "ii its effect consists in secular precessions amounting to:@xmath1 where mas / y stands for milliarcseconds per year    in this work it is presented an alternative strategy in order to derive the secular gravitomagnetic precessions which reveals itself useful especially in the prediction of the behavior of all the keplerian orbital elements of the test body in the gravitational field of different kinds of central rotating sources .",
    "indeed , the calculations involve not only the secular effects for a perfectly spherical source , which lead to , but also for a central body which is only axially symmetric .    until now the general relativistic motion in the field of a non spherical central body has been treated in for a static , nonrotating source and in for a rotating source in the context of the gp - b mission .",
    "the influence of the non sphericity of the central source on the gravitomagnetic clock effect is investigated in .",
    "our calculations are based on the use of the lagrangian planetary equations and a noncentral hamiltonian term whose existence , if from one hand can be rigorously deduced , from the other hand can be intuitively guessed by analogy from the corresponding term in electrodynamics for a charged particle acted upon by electric and magnetic fields .",
    "in general , it can be proved that the general relativistic equations of motion of a test particle of mass @xmath2 freely falling in a stationary gravitational field , in the weak field and slow motion approximation , are given by : mm(*e*_g+ _ g ) .",
    "[ cif]in @xmath3 is the speed of light @xmath4 while @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the gravitoelectric and the gravitomagnetic fields , respectively .    if a perfectly spherically symmetric rotating body is assumed as gravitational source , in eq.([cif ] ) @xmath7 is the newtonian gravitational field of a spherical body , with @xmath8 its mass and @xmath9 the newtonian gravitational constant , while @xmath6 is given by : _ g= _",
    "g2  [ ] , in which : _ g(*r*)-2.[acchina]in is the angular momentum of the central body .",
    "the field @xmath10 , named gravitomagnetic potential , is due to the off - diagonal components of the spacetime metric tensor : g_=_+h _ ,  , = 0,1,2,3,where @xmath11 is the minkowski metric tensor and @xmath12 . in obtaining a non rotating reference frame",
    "@xmath13 with the @xmath14 axis directed along * j * and the @xmath15 plane coinciding with the equatorial plane of the gravitational source has been used .",
    "the origin is located at the center of mass of the central body .",
    "the gravitomagnetic potential generates a non central gravitational contribute due uniquely to the angular momentum of the gravitational source that the newtonian mechanics does not predict , though the conditions of validity of eq.([cif ] ) are the same for which the latter holds as well .",
    "so it is possible to speak of mass - energy currents whose motion exerts a non central gravitational force on a test massive body analogous to the lorentz force felt by a charged particle of charge @xmath16 and mass @xmath2 when it is moving in a electromagnetic field . indeed , its equations of motions : mq(*e*+ ) [ lor]are formally analogous to eq.([cif ] ) .",
    "eq.([lor ] ) can be derived by means of the lagrangian : _ e.m.=mv^2-qv+ ( * v*),where @xmath17 is the velocity of the particle while @xmath18 and * a * are the scalar and vector potential , respectively , of the electromagnetic field .    since one of the most promising way to detect the gravitomagnetic precession",
    "consists in employing artificial earth satellites , it would be helpful to derive the rate equations for the change in the parameters that characterize their orbits .",
    "to this aim one could introduce `` by hand '' a perturbative term @xmath19 in the gravitational lagrangian of the particle and use it in some particular perturbative scheme ; the constant @xmath20 would be determined by means of dimensional considerations and taking in account that it should be built up of universal constants .",
    "in fact it is possible to show that a non central term analogous to @xmath21 can be rigorously deduced in the lagrangian of a test body in the gravitational field of a spinning mass - energy distribution , and that it can be exploited in deriving straightforwardly the effect of the gravitomagnetic potential on the keplerian orbital elements of the test body .",
    "the relativistic lagrangian for a free particle of mass @xmath2 in a gravitational field can be cast into the form : = ^(0)+^(1).in the term @xmath22 refers to the off - diagonal terms of the metric : ^(1 ) = g_0k.in this case , recalling that the slow motion approximation is used , becomes : ^(1)_gm  ( * a*_g).in this paper it is proposed to adopt @xmath23 given by , with @xmath10 given by , in order to derive the lense - thirring effect on the orbital elements of a particle in the field of a rotating gravitational source .    to this aim",
    "it must be assumed that under the gravitomagnetic force the departures of the test body s trajectory from the unperturbed keplerian ellipse are very small in time .",
    "this allows to introduce the concept of osculating ellipse .",
    "so the perturbed motion can be described in terms of unperturbed keplerian elements varying in time .",
    "consider the frame @xmath13 previously defined and a frame @xmath24 with the @xmath25 axis directed along the orbital angular momentum @xmath26 of the test body , the plane @xmath27 coinciding with the orbital plane of the test particle and the @xmath28 axis directed toward the pericenter . @xmath13 and",

    "it is useful isolating in @xmath59 the central part @xmath61 of the gravitational field from the terms @xmath62 which may cause the keplerian orbital elements to change in time : @xmath63 . in this way @xmath64",
    "becomes : = + -=+ .concerning the perturbative scheme to be employed , the well known lagrange planetary equations are adopted . at first order , they are : @xmath65 the idea of this work consists in using @xmath23 to obtain a suitable non central term @xmath66 to be employed in these equations .",

    "the secular effects can be worked out by adopting the same strategy followed in for a similar kind of perturbing functions . when eq.([ru ] ) is averaged over one orbital period @xmath70 of the test body , @xmath71 and @xmath37",

    "a= 3 n.from and it appears that there are no secular changes in the semimajor axis , and so the orbital period of the test body , related to the mean motion by @xmath77 , can be considered constant .",

    "using in one obtains for the secular rates : @xmath78 they are the well known lense - thirring equations . in deriving them",

    "if we assume that the current distribution rotates uniformly around an axis , chosen as @xmath14 axis , then , since for any current element @xmath81 with @xmath82 angular velocity of the current distribution becomes:=d*r^*.in order to deal with an axisymmetric current distribution let us introduce the cylindrical coordinates : \\ {    lx= + y= + z = z ,    .@xmath83 . in this case",
    "it can be shown that the lines of the potential vector are circles around the @xmath14 axis and its modulus is a cylindrical symmetric function of @xmath84 and @xmath14 .",
