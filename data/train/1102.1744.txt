    "for planetary scale rotating and stratified fluid dynamics @xcite estimated the orders of magnitude of different terms in the euler equations by using typical values of large scale atmospheric motion . from these arguments , which included approximate hydrostatic and geostrophic balance ,",
    "he derived reduced sets of equations called the quasi - geostrophic equations ( qg ) that are widely used in idealized studies of oceanic and atmospheric dynamics .",
    "in addition to finding equations that govern the large scales charney also points out that the qg equations filtered out the inconsequential fast waves from the large scale motions .    in the work of @xcite they showed that the qg limit ( [ rossby number ] @xmath3 , [ froude number ] @xmath5 , and @xmath6 finite ) , can also be derived from the rotating boussinesq equations with periodic boundary conditions , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bousnd2])-([eq : buoynd2 ] ) .",
    "their asymptotic analysis relies on the separation of fast and slow time scales and incorporates the fast waves that were filtered out in charney s analysis .",
    "the resulting limiting equations are obtained by averaging over the fast time scale and accounts for three - waves interactions of fast and slow waves . moreover ,",
    "a rigorous justification of this approach was given by a direct application of schochet s method of cancellation of oscillations for hyperbolic equations , @xcite .",
    "in these papers , taking @xmath7 corresponds to geostrophic balance and taking @xmath8 corresponds to hydrostatic balance .",
    "when both these parameters go to zero the equations for the slow dynamics decouple from the fast and are charney s qg equations .",
    "in addition to the quasi - geostrophic regime described above we consider the dynamics of two other dynamical regimes : 1 ) the strong stratification limit where the physics is dominated by strong stratification but has only weak rotational effects and 2 ) the strong rotation limit where the physics is dominated by fast rotation but is only weakly stratified .",
    "the first limit , the strong stratification limit , is thought to be important in geophysical fluid dynamics , see the review by @xcite , because it describes flows that occur at length scales between the large , quasi - geostrophic scales and the small scales where energy is dissipated .",
    "fluid dynamical theory for this physical regime has been explored by @xcite .",
    "parametrically this regime is described by @xmath9 .",
    "here it has also been found that the slow dynamics decouples from the fast and that it leads to new equations for the slow dynamics that are not the qg equations derived by charney .    one way the slow dynamics of the qg limit differs from the slow dynamics of the strong stratification limit is in the role of the zero frequency dispersive waves . to explore this",
    "we examine the eigenfrequencies of the nondimensional linearized rotating boussinesq equations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bousnd2])-([eq : buoynd2 ] ) in the absence of dissipative effects , @xmath10 where @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 the horizontal wave numbers , @xmath14 the vertical wave number , and @xmath15",
    ". there are two kinds of eigenfrequencies .",
    "the first kind are the slow vortical modes that have zero frequency for all @xmath16 , and contribute to the potential vorticity .",
    "the second kind are the dispersive waves that have non - zero frequency but make no contribution to potential vorticity .",
    "the latter are the familiar inertia - gravity waves that are filtered from charney s qg equations . in the strong stratification limit ( see @xcite ) where @xmath17 , the fast eigenfrequencies are , @xmath18 again there are two kinds of eigenfrequencies , the slow vortical modes and the fast gravity waves .",
    "however , here the fast waves contribute to the slow dynamics when @xmath19 .",
    "that is , one of the wave modes , corresponding to horizontal averages with zero potential vorticity , has a slow component that resonates with the pv bearing vortical modes .",
    "this manifests itself in the vertically sheared horizontal dynamics ( vshf ) mode introduced by @xcite and investigated by @xcite .    in this work , we look at the strong rotation ( low rossby ) limit where geostrophic balance dominates but the flow is only weakly stratified .",
    "these dynamics are parametrically described by the limit @xmath20 .",
    "this physical regime is relevant in regions of the deep ocean where stratification is weak but rotational effects are dominant .",
    "for example , @xcite observe values of @xmath21 in the deep mediterranean sea and argue that the dynamics in those regions are driven by both weak stratification and the horizontal components rotation .",
    "in fact , they observe nonhydrostatic motions with vertical velocities of the same order of magnitude as the horizontal .",
    "another region of the world where strong rotation and weak stratification have been observed is in the deep arctic ocean .",
    "measurements in the beaufort gyre by @xcite show @xmath22 above 2600 meters and @xmath23 between the depths of 2600 and 3600 m .",
    "one of the reasons these investigators give for studying the deep arctic is that in their 2002 pilot study they discovered the dynamics to be unexpectedly active in the deep ocean .",
    "weak stratification in the deep ocean at high latitudes has been noted for the north atlantic and north pacific in @xcite where they compute mean profiles of density and brunt - visla frequency ; in the deep waters of the arctic ocean by @xcite ; and in the southern ocean by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , warm core eddies with depths of 1000 meters or more have been observed in the arctic by @xcite .    in the limit of strong rotation and weak stratification ( @xmath24 )",
    "the fast eigenfrequencies are , @xmath25 again , there are two kinds of frequencies corresponding to fast inertial waves and slow pv modes . also , in this limit the non pv bearing modes make a contribution to the slow dynamics , but this time it occurs when @xmath26 , which corresponds to vertically averaged dynamics , which we refer to as taylor - proudman dynamics .    by using the general framework developed in @xcite we show that in the low rossby number limit the horizontal and vertical dynamics decouple . in the horizontal",
    "the slow equations are the two - dimensional navier - stokes equations along with two conservation laws , the horizontal kinetic energy and the vertical vorticity . in the case where the flow is not stratified",
    "this is consistent with other work @xcite .",
    "the vertically averaged vertical momentum equation is an advection - diffusion like equation that couples to the buoyancy through its vertical average .",
    "the slow equation for the buoyancy is the only quantity that remains fully three dimensional and is advected by all 3 components of the slow velocity .",
    "the slow equations for the vertical momentum and the buoyancy are coupled and give rise to new conservation laws for the coupled @xmath27 dynamics .",
    "we also show that the slow modes evolve independently of the fast and that the total energy is composed of both slow and fast components , while the potential enstrophy is , to leading order in the expansion parameter , purely slow .",
    "the reduced equations and their conservation laws are supported by numerical simulations using low wave number forcing .",
    "these slow equations are not quasi - geostrophic because they are nonhydrostatic .",
    "the boussinesq equations for flow moving at a constant rotation about the @xmath28 axis for vertically stratified flow is , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the material derivative , @xmath31 is the eulerian velocity , @xmath32 is the pressure and the total density @xmath33 has been decomposed into @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a constant background reference value of the density , @xmath36 is the density gradient in the vertical , and @xmath37 is the density fluctuation .",
    "we assume @xmath38 for stable stratification .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 is twice the frame rotation rate , @xmath40 is the acceleration of gravity , @xmath41 is the kinematic viscosity , and @xmath42 the diffusion coefficient .    in order to distinguish the physical mechanisms of fast rotation from weak stratification we use the same velocity and length scales for all three components of velocity and in all three dimensions .",
    "therefore we nondimensionalize using the following characteristic scales ; @xmath43 is the length scale for the three spatial coordinates @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the velocity scale , and @xmath46 is the advective time scale .",
    "the scale for the density fluctuation is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the brunt - visl frequency",
    ". then we arrive at the following nondimensional quantities , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the rossby number , @xmath51 is the froude number , @xmath52 is the euler number , @xmath53 is the reynolds number , and @xmath54 is the prandtl number .",
    "then the non - dimensional boussinesq equations for rotating and stratified flow are , @xmath55    it is clear that @xmath56 and @xmath37 are the evolution variables in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bousnd])-([eq : buoynd ] ) and that the role of the pressure gradient term in the momentum equation is to enforce the incompressibility condition . by eliminating the pressure term it is possible to recast the boussinesq equations exclusively in terms of the evolution variables and at the same time to incorporate the incompressibility constraint .",
    "this equivalent formulation is however in nonlocal form . to write these equations in their nonlocal form",
    "take the divergence of the momentum equation to find the equation for the pressure , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the inverse laplacian operator and @xmath59 is the local vorticity .",

    "( [ eq : bousnd2 ] ) results in @xmath61 , so that if @xmath62 is zero initially , then it remains zero for all time .",
    "a quantity of fundamental importance is the potential vorticity @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",

    "here we formulate the limiting dynamics for the rapidly rotating boussinesq equations , i.e. in the limit of @xmath3 and @xmath77 . in doing",
    "so we will follow the approach developed in in great generality by embid and majda ( 1998 ) and which builds upon earlier work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , the present work complements the work of embid and majda which focused on the cases where @xmath5 with either @xmath78 finite or @xmath79 .",
    "the analysis starts with the recasting of the rotating boussinesq equations in an abstract setting that reveals its key structure .",
    "this is followed with the asymptotic formulation of the slow dynamics equations in the limit of @xmath3 and balanced initial data , i.e. without fast inertial waves . finally , we adapt the theory developed by embid and majda to formulate limiting dynamics equations in the limit of @xmath3 and with fast inertial waves .      if we introduce the vector @xmath80 and let @xmath81 , then the rotating boussinesq equations , eqs .",

    "it is clear that eq .",
    "( [ eq : operatorbous ] ) becomes singular in the limit of @xmath89 , and the fast operator @xmath83 will have a dominant role .",
    "the remaining terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : operatorbous ] ) are given by the bilinear advective operator @xmath90 and the diffusion operator @xmath91 .",
    "as we mentioned before , if the initial data @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : operatorbous ] ) is divergence free , then the solution remains divergence free for all time .",
    "but in fact more is true , each individual operator @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 takes solenoidal fields into solenoidal fields .",
    "therefore a natural setting for eq .",
    "( [ eq : operatorbous ] ) is the hilbert space @xmath93 of vector fields @xmath94 in @xmath95 that are divergence free , @xmath96 , and equipped with the @xmath95  norm , which is physically equivalent to the total energy , @xmath97 .",
    "in addition , we assume @xmath98-periodicity in all the space variables .",
    "this choice of boundary conditions considerably simplifies the study of eq .",
    "( [ eq : operatorbous ] ) , particularly the analysis of the operator @xmath83 , and the resulting slow limiting dynamics equations , eq .",
    "( [ eq : slowdyn ] ) , and the fast wave averaging equations , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fastdyn ] ) .",
    "the reason for this simplification is the fact that the associated eigenfunctions are given explicitly in terms of fourier modes .",
    "in addition , the choice of periodic boundary conditions is consistent with the numerical simulations presented in section 4 . changing the domain and the boundary conditions can make the mathematical analysis quite difficult ; for example , for arbitrary bounded domains it may be impossible to characterize the eigenfunctions of @xmath83 .",
    "the choice of an infinite domain may change drastically the structure of the null space ( slow waves ) and the range ( fast waves ) of the operator @xmath83 .",
    "one key observation is the fact that the operator @xmath83 ( and @xmath84 ) is skew - hermitian in @xmath93 : for @xmath99 and @xmath100 in @xmath93 , @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the conjugate transpose of @xmath103 .",
    "several important properties follow from this fact .",
    "first , eq .",
    "( [ eq : operatorbous ] ) satisfies ( in the absence of diffusion ) the conservation of energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : energynd ] ) .",
    "this property is shared with other important systems in mathematical physics , such as the euler and the maxwell equations .",
    "second , according to the spectral theorem , skew - hermitian operators have purely imaginary eigenvalues and an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions , see @xcite .",
    "physically this means that the basic normal mode solutions of equations represent wave motions .",
    "finally , the null space of @xmath83 , @xmath104 , is orthogonal to the range of @xmath83 , @xmath105 .",
    "this can be thought of a consequence of the spectral theorem because @xmath104 is spanned by the eigenfunctions with zero eigenvalue ( slow modes ) whereas @xmath105 is spanned by the remaining eigenfunctions with non - zero eigenvalues ( fast modes ) .",
    "this last property will be exploited later in the derivation of the slow dynamics equations .",
    "next we apply the previous observations to the linear equation @xmath106 and seek normal mode solutions in the form of harmonic plane waves @xmath107,\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is the wave number , @xmath109 is the frequency and the purely imaginary number @xmath110 is the eigenvalue of @xmath83 associated with the eigenfunction @xmath111 $ ] .",
    "the four eigenfrequencies @xmath112 are given by the dispersion relations @xmath113 therefore the equations admit slow modes moving on time scales @xmath4 when @xmath114 and fast waves moving on time scales @xmath115 when @xmath116 .",
    "the fast waves in this limit are * gyroscopic or inertial waves*. they are waves who owe their existence to the presence of the coriolis force and were originally described by @xcite .",
    "descriptions of these waves can be found in @xcite and @xcite . of course , if @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : freqr0 ] ) then we only have slow gyroscopic waves .",
    "explicit formulas for the eigenvectors @xmath117 associated with the fast and slow normal modes are given in the appendix .",
    "here we consider the limiting dynamics equations as @xmath3 under the assumption that the solution @xmath118 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : operatorbous ] ) evolves only on the slow ( advective ) time scale . the formal derivation in the context of the abstract operator equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : operatorbous ] ) , is straightforward .",

    "in particular , the initial data @xmath126 is in @xmath104 to leading order in @xmath127 . the next contribution of order @xmath128 yields @xmath129 the slow limiting dynamics equation is now obtained by projecting eq .",
    "( [ eq : orderone ] ) onto @xmath104 as follows .",
    "first apply the orthogonal projection @xmath130 of @xmath93 onto @xmath104 to both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : orderone ] ) . since @xmath131 is in @xmath104 for all time",

    "finally , we eliminate the superscript in @xmath131 and obtain the slow limiting dynamics equations @xmath137 next we notice that , to leading order in @xmath127 , it is enough for the initial data @xmath138 to be in @xmath104 to automatically guarantee that the solution @xmath139 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : slowdyn ] ) remains in @xmath104 for all time .",
    "indeed , if we integrate in time eq .",
    "( [ eq : slowdyn ] ) and use the fact that @xmath140 , we conclude that @xmath141 for all time .",
    "moreover , we will show shortly that in the context of the rotating boussinesq equations the null space @xmath104 consists precisely of the * taylor - proudman * columnar flows , @xcite .",
    "therefore we can say that to leading order in @xmath127 , if the initial data is a taylor - proudman column ( i.e. free of fast inertial waves ) , then the solution @xmath103 remains a taylor - proudman column for all time and its evolution is described by the slow dynamics equations .",
    "when the initial data is a taylor - proudman column to leading order in @xmath127 we say that the flow is in approximate taylor - proudman balance .",
    "finally we remark that all these formal considerations can be established with full mathematical rigor through a direct application of the general theory of singular limits of hyperbolic systems first developed by @xcite , @xcite , with later additions by @xcite .    to obtain the concrete formulation of the slow dynamics for the boussinesq equations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : operatorbous])- ( [ eq : operatord ] ) , we need to determine explicitly the null space @xmath104 and its orthogonal projection @xmath130 . for this purpose",

    "<S> in this paper we explore the strong rotation limit of the rotating and stratified boussinesq equations with periodic boundary conditions when the stratification is order one ( [ rossby number ] @xmath0 , [ froude number ] @xmath1 , as @xmath2 ) . using the same framework of @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we show that the slow dynamics decouples from the fast . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we derive equations for the slow dynamics and their conservation laws . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal momentum equations reduce to the two - dimensional navier - stokes equations . </S>",
    "<S> the equation for the vertically averaged vertical velocity includes a term due to the vertical average of the buoyancy . </S>",
    "<S> the buoyancy equation , the only variable to retain its three - dimensionality , is advected by all three two - dimensional slow velocity components . </S>",
    "<S> the conservation laws for the slow dynamics include those for the two - dimensional navier stokes equations and a new conserved quantity that describes dynamics between the vertical kinetic energy and the buoyancy . the leading order potential enstrophy is slow while the leading order total energy retains both fast and slow dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform forced numerical simulations of the rotating boussinesq equations to demonstrate support for three aspects of the theory in the limit @xmath3 : 1 ) we find the formation and persistence of large - scale columnar taylor - proudman flows in the presence of @xmath4 froude number ; after a spin - up time 2 ) the ratio of the slow total energy to the total energy approaches a constant and that at the smallest rossby numbers that constant approaches one ; and 3 ) the ratio of the slow potential enstrophy to the total potential enstrophy also approaches a constant and that at the lowest rossby numbers that constant is one . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the numerical simulations indicate that even in the presence of the low wave number white noise forcing the dynamics exhibit characteristics of the theory . </S>"
