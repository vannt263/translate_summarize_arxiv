    "in both high energy and condensed matter physics , there is a long tradition of studying systems which exhibit topological excitations .",
    "recently , this field has received a new impetus , since it has been realized that such topological excitations may permit fault tolerant storage and manipulation of quantum information  @xcite . in connection with this , there are current experimental efforts to prove the existence of nontrivial topological phases in the fractional quantum hall effect@xcite and to construct such phases in josephson junction networks @xcite .",
    "topological excitations are usually introduced at the classical level as solutions to the equations of motion and the observables that distinguish them are directly linked to topologically invariant properties of these solutions . this places topological particles in marked contrast to the more usual perturbative ( quasi)particles . the latter are described as low energy quantum fluctuations over a given vacuum state .",
    "the group of symmetries of the system that fixes the vacuum state will act on the fluctuations and cause them to organize into multiplets . as a result these perturbative particle states form irreducible representations of the symmetry group . for topological particles",
    "no such labeling is obviously present .",
    "a similar dichotomy exists when considering the ground states of different phases , or the order parameters that distinguish between phases .",
    "traditionally , when a phase exhibits ground state degeneracy , the different ground states would be related by the action of symmetry operators , but in topological phases , ground state degeneracies appear for models on topologically nontrivial spatial manifolds without the obvious intervention of any symmetry , and in fact the different ground states can often not be mixed by any local operator .",
    "analogously , traditional phases can be distinguished by the expectation values of local order parameters , while different topological phases may exist which are not distinguished by any local order parameter . as a result",
    "a number of indicators for _ topological order _ which are not based on symmetry have emerged , notably the dimensions of the spaces of ground states on spatial surfaces of non - trivial topology @xcite and the topological entanglement entropy @xcite .    despite the fact that topological phases may not be fully characterized by their symmetries ( or at least not by symmetries represented by local operators ) , one may often still organize the excitation spectra of such phases by using ` symmetries ' that are not obvious from the hamiltonian or lagrangian of the system and which may in fact not be realized locally .",
    "thus one may hope for a generalization or analogue of the theory of symmetry breaking phase transitions which applies topological phases , by allowing for such ` topological symmetries ' .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to set up such a formalism for the particular case of phase transitions which occur due to the formation of a condensate of bosonic quasiparticles . before we go into a further description of this formalism ,",
    "let us make some remarks which we hope may prevent confusion in reading the rest of the paper .",
    "first of all , we do not want to limit ourselves to ` strictly topological phases ' , which have no nontrivial symmetries represented by local operators .",
    "in fact we will include theories which have a discrete symmetry represented by local operators but no nontrivial topology as a special case .",
    "we would like to point out that in gauge theories , electric charges , which are supposedly ` non - topological particles ' , coming from the locally represented gauge symmetry of the system , can have nontrivial topological interactions with magnetic fluxes through the aharonov - bohm effect , so in order to describe the full topological order of gauge theories it is necessary to take the usual gauge symmetry into account .",
    "secondly , we will often speak of ` symmetry breaking ' when some of the symmetries involved may be gauge symmetries .",
    "gauge theories can be interpreted to a certain extent as constrained systems ; some of the gauge degrees of freedom are auxiliary and could in principle be eliminated at the price of introducing very complicated interactions among the true physical degrees of freedom . in a theory with a gauge symmetry the physical states are the gauge invariant states , so the spectrum does not manifestly exhibit the degeneracies of nontrivial representations in the spectrum and one may wonder at the idea of a symmetry breaking phase transition . however , despite the absence of gauge - variant states , the physics of gauge theories certainly depends on the invariants characterizing the representations that are present in the model and one speaks of gauge symmetries as ` hidden symmetries ' .",
    "a similar situation occurs in topological field theory , where the particles often do not have internal degrees of freedom on which a symmetry could act , but nevertheless , their fusion rules can be described by the representation theory of a quantum group .",
    "hidden symmetry breaking is to a large extent analogous to the usual breaking of global , non - gauge symmetries . in the global case , there is typically a local order parameter that breaks the symmetry and as a result , in the broken phase the degeneracies due to the original symmetry are ( partially ) lifted , and the spectrum is now organized in representations of the smaller residual symmetry group .",
    "a gauge symmetry can not be broken by a local order parameter ( by elitzur s theorem@xcite ) . yet",
    ", condensates with invariant order parameters are allowed and the hidden symmetry can effectively be reduced due to such a condensate .",
    "this phenomenon is usually referred to as the higgs effect or the ` breaking ' of a hidden ( or local ) symmetry . bearing this warning in mind",
    "our philosophy is to use the term ` breaking ' in this cavalier way .",
    "a well known example of topological symmetry occurs in gauge theories with gauge group @xmath0 defined on a lattice in dimensions@xcite in such gauge theories , the spectrum consists of charges , whose internal state transforms under the @xmath0 gauge group , magnetic fluxes ( where flux is the topological quantum number ) , which are gauge invariant and composites of charge and flux , called dyons .",
    "one sees immediately that the @xmath0 representation label on the particles is not enough to completely fix the sector , since it is blind to the flux .",
    "however , one may introduce a second dual  @xmath0 symmetry  which is not a gauge symmetry , and which acts on fluxes in the same way that the original gauge group acts on charges and which leaves states without flux invariant .",
    "the topological sectors of the theory are then completely distinguished by their behavior under the full @xmath1 symmetry and the addition of flux and charge quantum numbers is also captured by the tensor product of @xmath1 representations .",
    "one may even include the aharonov - bohm braid interactions between charges and fluxes by introducing a new structure on @xmath2 called the universal @xmath3-matrix .",
    "in general , one can not expect to capture the full particle spectrum and topological interactions of a physical system using only group theory .",
    "still , it is believed that every type of topological order in 2 + 1 dimensional systems can be described using the representation theory of a modular tensor category or , dually , a quantum group .",
    "the different types of quasiparticle correspond to the irreducible representations of the quantum group and the fusion and braiding interactions are described by the tensor product of representations and the @xmath3-matrix respectively .",
    "this asks for generalization of the theory of symmetry breaking phase transitions to include topological symmetries described by quantum groups . in earlier work@xcite ,",
    "we have developed such a theory of ` spontaneous ' quantum group symmetry breaking and applied it to discrete gauge theories .",
    "this theory was later refined and applied to phase transitions in quantum nematics and other systems@xcite .",
    "recent work of bombin and martin - delgado @xcite also provides interesting realizations of such transitions in models based on kitaev s toric code model@xcite , which exhibits the same topological order as the discrete gauge theories .     that may have irreps which are in fact confined .",
    "the low energy effective theory of the condensed phase is based on the unconfined algebra @xmath4.,width=307 ]    the general features of our symmetry breaking scheme are as follows ( see figure [ fig : symscheme ] ) . before condensation ,",
    "the system is described by a quantum group @xmath5 and each particle carries an irreducible representation ( irrep ) of @xmath5 .",
    "when particles carrying the representation @xmath6 condense , the condensate will have an order parameter which is a state in the module of the representation @xmath6 .",
    "the symmetry of the condensed phase should leave this order parameter invariant and hence the quantum group @xmath5 is broken down to a hopf subalgebra @xmath7 whose representations characterize the excitations of the condensed phase . depending on their braiding interaction with the condensed particles , these excitations may or may not be confined . in particular ,",
    "if an excitation over the condensate has nontrivial braiding with the condensed particle then the order parameter of the condensate will not be single valued near this excitation and the excitation will pull a string or wall in the condensate and be confined ( the energy required for the creation of the string will be linear in the string s length , since the condensate is destroyed near the string ) .",
    "the non - confined particles are particles in the true sense of the word , that is , point - like excitations , and their interactions are described by the representation theory of a ` hopf quotient ' @xmath4 of @xmath8 ( @xmath4 is the image of @xmath8 under a surjective map that preserves the hopf algebra structure ) .",
    "the strings pulled by the confined particles can also be studied and they are classified by the representations of a subalgebra of @xmath8 which is determined by the hopf map from @xmath8 onto @xmath4 and which is analogous to the kernel of a homomorphism between groups .",
    "and @xmath9 representations of @xmath10 ) .",
    "the states on the outer edge belong to representations that are not confined in the outer region ( the @xmath9 and the @xmath11 of @xmath12).,width=240 ]    in the sequel , we will devise a treatment of hopf symmetry breaking which generalizes the treatment given in our earlier papers , while keeping the amount of quantum group or hopf algebra theory that is needed to a minimum .",
    "therefore , it will not be necessary to flesh out the details of the algebras contained in diagram  [ fig : symscheme ] ( detailed definitions can be found in the original papers ) .",
    "however , the structure of the diagram will be preserved , in that there will still be two levels to our treatment of condensation - induced phase transitions .",
    "first , the symmetry is broken , leading to a spectrum of excitations that occur in the broken phase , or on an interface between domains that support the broken and unbroken phases .",
    "then these excitations are separated into confined and non - confined excitations , where the word ` confined ' means that the excitations are either bound to a boundary between a domain in the broken phase and a domain in the unbroken phase , or bound together like quarks in hadrons .",
    "this should lead us finally to a description of the fusion and braiding properties of the non - confined particles and ultimately also to a description of the strings pulled by the confined particles and a classification of hadronic  composites of confined particles .",
    "the breaking schemes we discuss may also have interesting applications in describing the physics of spatial geometries where interfaces between different topological phases occur , that may be enforced by external means ( by applying different magnetic fields for example ) .",
    "we give an example of such a two phase geometry in figure [ fig : edgeinterface ] , where the interface carries only those edge states of the interior disc ( with phase i ) , which are confined in phase ii of the outer region , the outer edge carries ( non - confined ) states that are also allowed in the outer region .",
    "we will return to the specific phases indicated in the figure later on . in line with this application one may also draw conclusions on the boundary theory of certain two layer systems as will be explained in sections [ sec : embeddings2 ] and [ sec : doublec - s ] .",
    "let us quickly review the minimal knowledge of @xmath13-dimensional topological field theory that we will need for the rest of the paper . for much more detail , the reader may consult for instance refs .  .",
    "first of all , we assume that the theory has a finite number of topological sectors , labeled by some finite set of labels . we will call these _ anyonic charges _ , or in some cases _ topological charges _ , especially when it is not obvious if we are dealing with charges characterizing point - like excitations .",
    "we can think of these charges as topological quantum numbers , but also as charges related to some ( group ) symmetry and sometimes , like in the case of @xmath0 gauge theory described before , we can think of them either way .",
    "in many physical situations , it is necessary to introduce superselection sectors which correspond to the same topological charges but which have different non - topological quantum numbers ( these may for instance characterize short - range interactions ) . for the purposes of this paper , we will ignore these and consider such sectors to be the same . as a result",
    "we can describe theories which include electric charge and other gauge charges as if they have only finitely many sectors .",
    "the basic interactions between topological sectors in 2 + 1 dimensions are _ fusion _ and _ braiding_. fusion may be summarized using _ fusion rules _ of the form @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the two topological charges which are to be fused , the labels @xmath17 are the possible overall topological charges of the result of the fusion and the integer coefficients @xmath18 indicate the number of independent couplings between @xmath15 and @xmath16 that give @xmath17 .",
    "concretely , a zero fusion coefficient means that the charges @xmath15 and @xmath16 can not fuse to @xmath17 and a nonzero coefficient means they can .",
    "one may think of the fusion coefficient @xmath18 as the dimension of the space of low energy states of a piece of topological medium which has overall topological charge @xmath17 and which contains two topological excitations with charges @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a physical requirement on fusion rules is that they must be associative , that is @xmath19 we also require that there is a unique vacuum sector , labeled @xmath20 or @xmath21 , depending on the context , which has the property that @xmath22 for any other sector @xmath15 .",
    "finally , we require that any sector @xmath15 has a charge conjugate sector , denoted @xmath23 , with which it can fuse to the vacuum in a unique way , i.e. @xmath24 for systems with well defined braiding interactions ( that is , all two - dimensional systems with pointlike excitations ) , we will also have ` symmetry of the fusion interaction ' , that is @xmath25 .. ]    any topological charge @xmath15 has a _ spin factor _ @xmath26 associated with it .",
    "this is a phase factor that the wave function of the anyonic system picks up when the anyon is rotated ( twisted ) over a @xmath27 angle .",
    "we can think of the particle as being in an eigenstate of two dimensional spin and the spin factor is the effect of a @xmath27 rotation on this eigenstate .",
    "we will also use the spin @xmath28 of the particle , which is related to the spin factor by @xmath29 . for systems with finitely many topological sectors ,",
    "the spins are always rational@xcite .",
    "adiabatic exchanges of the particles ( without twisting ) also have an effect on the wave function of the system .",
    "this is the analogue of the statistical interaction of fermions or bosons ( for bosons the fact that there is no effect of the exchanges actually tells us a lot about collective behaviour ) . in two dimensions",
    "these exchanges are governed by the braid group , rather than the permutation group .",
    "in particular this means that left over right exchanges are not the same as their inverses , the right over left exchanges .",
    "the product of two right over left exchanges is often called the _",
    "monodromy_. it returns the excitations to their original positions , but may nevertheless have a nontrivial effect on the state of the system .",
    "this effect may be described in terms of fusion and twisting , using the so called ` ribbon equation ' whose pictorial representation is shown in figure  [ fig : ribbon ] .",
    "the braiding process is topologically the same as a full twist of the region containing both charges ( i.e.  a full twist of their fusion product ) , combined with full twists of the charges themselves in the opposite direction .",
    "hence , given two anyonic charges @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the effect of the monodromy on the fusion channels that yield overall charge @xmath17 is to introduce a phase factor @xmath30 , or @xmath31 .",
    "like the monodromy , many of the other properties of the topological phase may be obtained directly from the fusion rules and the spin factors .",
    "examples are the quantum dimension @xmath32 of a particle labeled @xmath15 , the modular matrices @xmath33 and @xmath34 and the topological central charge @xmath17 .",
    "we give formulas for all these quantities here .",
    "the quantum dimension @xmath32 of the sector @xmath15 gives the asymptotic number of fusion channels available when many particles of type @xmath15 are fused together .",
    "if there are @xmath35 such particles , then the total number of fusion channels scales asymptotically as @xmath36 for large @xmath35 .",
    "we may find @xmath32 as the perron - frobenius eigenvalue of the fusion matrix @xmath37 whose elements are defined by @xmath38 .",
    "the quantum dimensions are real and positive and they have the important property that they are conserved under fusion , that is @xmath39 the total quantum dimension @xmath40 is defined by @xmath41 the quantity @xmath42 can be considered the quantum dimension of the quantum group that underlies the system .",
    "the topological entanglement entropy of the ground state of a system in a topological phase is proportional to the logarithm of @xmath40 .    the topological central charge @xmath17 is defined by the following formula .",
    "it is only determined up to a multiple of @xmath43 . @xmath44",
    "any conformal field theory whose topological sectors have these quantum dimensions and spin factors must have conformal central charge @xmath45 equal to @xmath17 modulo @xmath43 .",
    "it is in fact impossible to find out more about the conformal central charge of a cft from the tqft corresponding to the cft than its value up to multiples of @xmath43 . to see this",
    "one may consider the @xmath46 wzw model at level @xmath21 .",
    "this is a cft at @xmath47 which has only one primary field , or topological sector .",
    "tensoring any cft with copies of this @xmath48 model allows one to change the central charge of the cft by multiples of @xmath43 without changing the corresponding tqft .    on a surface of nontrivial topology",
    ", a tqft will have a set of degenerate ground states . on the torus",
    "there is one state for every topological sector ( for anyon models described by a _",
    "modular _ tensor category ) .",
    "the mapping class group of the surface acts projectively on this ground state space . in the case of the torus",
    "this means we can work with ordinary representations of the double cover of the mapping class group , the famous modular group generated by two elements @xmath33 and @xmath34 subject to the relations @xmath49 here @xmath50 is an element of order @xmath51 .",
    "on the basis of states labeled by the particle sectors @xmath50 is represented by the charge conjugation matrix , that is @xmath52 .    in a cft that realizes this tqft ,",
    "the modular @xmath33-matrix and @xmath34-matrix are given by@xcite @xmath53 the numbers @xmath54 can also be defined within tqft , as the trace of the monodromy acting on particles with labels @xmath55 .",
    "this , together with the ribbon equation , leads to the formula above .",
    "the formula for @xmath34 is interesting , because it depends on the value of the conformal central charge @xmath45 modulo @xmath56 .",
    "we just noted that the value of the central charge @xmath17 in a tqft is only determined modulo @xmath43 , so it seems that there might be a problem defining the above modular group representation for tqfts .",
    "however , it turns out that any choice of @xmath45 modulo @xmath56 , given that @xmath57 modulo @xmath43 , gives a good representation of the double cover of the modular group .",
    "the different choices just change the action of @xmath34 by a third root of unity and this factors through the relations  ( [ eq : modulargroup ] ) that @xmath33 and @xmath34 must satisfy .",
    "still , it is remarkable that cfts are able to see topological information that tqfts are blind to , namely a factor of a third root in the action of the modular matrix @xmath34 .",
    "of course one might include this third root into the definition of a tqft .",
    "if this is done , then there will be three tqfts with only one sector , realized in cft for example by the trivial , @xmath48 level @xmath21 and @xmath58 theories . taking this third root into account in any definition of _",
    "topological order _ would also necessarily mean that topologically ordered phases arise whose ground states on the torus are not degenerate , but do transform nontrivially under the action of @xmath34 .",
    "such phases can be realized by @xmath48 chern ",
    "simons theories at levels @xmath21 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "fusion rules , spin factors and the quantities that can be expressed in terms of these are the only elements of topological field theory that will be essential for an understanding of the main thread of the rest of this paper . an important question one may ask is thus whether fusion rules and spin factors are information that can be accessed through experiment . experimental probes of topological systems ( notably quantum hall systems ) that have been proposed in recent years include measurements of the tunneling current at point contacts and especially interferometric measurements of tunneling currents through double point contacts @xcite . in the case of fractional quantum hall states with abelian topological order , experiments with double point contacts have in fact recently been performed@xcite",
    ".    the tunneling current at a single point contact in a hall system is dominated at weak tunneling by the quasiparticle with the lowest scaling dimension . by observing the behavior of the tunneling current as a function of temperature , voltage or the size of the system@xcite",
    ", it should be possible , in principle , to extract this scaling dimension and from that the topological spin of the particle .",
    "extracting the spins of the other particles will probably be considerably more difficult .",
    "interference experiments with double point contacts are governed by the _ _ monodromy matrix__@xcite .",
    "this is just a normalized version @xmath60 of the @xmath33-matrix , given by @xmath61 it seems likely that at least some elements of the monodromy matrix @xmath60 will become available through interferometric measurements in any topological system that allows these . on the other hand",
    ", it should be noted that for example in the hall systems , it will be difficult to get elements that do not involve the quasiparticle of lowest scaling dimension , which naturally dominates the tunneling .",
    "if enough of the matrix elements of @xmath60 are known , it might be possible to reconstruct the whole @xmath60 matrix and its close relative , the s - matrix .",
    "the @xmath60 and @xmath33-matrices are strongly constrained by various tqft - identities , so a relatively small number of measured elements may be enough to determine them completely . from the @xmath33-matrix",
    "one may reconstruct the fusion rules using verlinde s formula , @xmath62 the @xmath33-matrix also gives information on the spins of the particles .",
    "for example , given the @xmath33-matrix and the fusion rules , the second line of equation ( [ modularmatrices ] ) becomes a system of equations for the spin factors @xmath63 .",
    "another set of equations for the spin factors comes from the fact that @xmath33 and @xmath34 satisfy the modular group relation @xmath64 .",
    "these equations do not always allow for a full determination of the @xmath63 : two theories which have the same @xmath33-matrix , but different spin factors are the ising model and the @xmath65 chern simons theory at level @xmath51 .",
    "these theories are distinguishable by their central charges , which are @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "however , there also exist examples of distinct theories with the same @xmath33-matrix as well as equal central charge , but with different spin factors , for example the two @xmath68 theories based on the quantum doubles of the finite groups @xmath69 ( the symmetry group of a square ) and @xmath70 ( the group of unit quaternions ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from ocneanu rigidity ( see section  [ sec : reconstructionphantasies ] ) that for given fusion rules ( and hence for any given @xmath33-matrix ) , there can only be finitely many possible solutions for the spinfactors .",
    "the mathematics of topological phases obviously involves more than just fusion rules and spin factors .",
    "the requirements on fusion we have given may be fleshed out with more mathematical structure to give the definition of a tensor category .",
    "similarly , including braiding and spin , we may get to the definition of a ribbon tensor category .",
    "the hilbert spaces and transition amplitudes of the topological systems we are interested in may then be viewed as coming from representations of such categories .",
    "the categories themselves in turn may be viewed as the representation categories of ( appropriately generalized ) quantum groups . while such structures will certainly be of importance for a more mathematically rigorous treatment of transitions between topological phases , that is not the aim of this paper and we intend instead to go into these details in a separate publication@xcite .",
    "still , one may ask at this point wether knowledge of the fusion rules and spin factors would allow one to reconstruct the full tqft describing the system . an important step towards answering",
    "this question is a mathematical theorem which is usually referred to as ocneanu rigidity @xcite .",
    "this theorem states that , given a set of fusion rules , there can only be a finite set of inequivalent tqfts , ribbon tensor categories , or just plain tensor categories corresponding to it .",
    "since we are given not only the fusion rules but also the spin factors , it seems likely that a tqft will be uniquely determined by this information in most cases .",
    "in fact , we are not aware of any example of a pair of inequivalent tqfts with the same fusion rules and spin factors and even if such pairs do exist in nature , it will be difficult to separate them by experimental observation , for instance because they have the same @xmath60-matrix .",
    "in 3 + 1 or more dimensions , bosons can be characterized either as particles with integer spin or as particles which have trivial exchange interactions , that is , wave functions for many identical bosons are invariant under exchanges of the bosons .",
    "these two properties are equivalent by the spin statistics theorem @xcite . in 2 + 1 dimensions , the requirements of integer spin and trivial statistics are no longer equivalent . there may be particles which have the property that when two of them are fused together , multiple fusion products may arise and the braiding of the original particles is trivial or nontrivial depending on the fusion channel they are in .",
    "therefore it is not completely obvious what constitutes a boson in dimension 2 + 1 .",
    "two necessary conditions for a particle @xmath15 to be a boson are the following .",
    "* @xmath15 should have trivial spin , that is @xmath71 , or @xmath72 .",
    "* @xmath15 should have partially ( or completely ) trivial self - monodromy .    by partially trivial self - monodromy , we mean that there should be _ at least _",
    "one fusion channel in @xmath73 for which the monodromy factor equals @xmath21 .",
    "in other words , if @xmath74 , then there should be at least one charge @xmath17 in the sum such that @xmath75 . since we already required that @xmath71 , this comes down to the the requirement that there is a fusion channel @xmath17 with trivial twist , @xmath76 .",
    "both of these conditions are special cases of a more general condition ,    * for every number @xmath35 of identical particles of type @xmath15 , there should be at least one state in the hilbert space for @xmath77 which is completely invariant under monodromy .",
    "this condition is a reasonable requirement for particles which should be able to condense , because for any particle number , it provides at least one state which will not notice any ` stirring ' .",
    "this is analogous to the requirement that any ` order parameter ' for the condensate should be single valued .",
    "the general condition is much more difficult to check than the two special cases mentioned earlier .",
    "a thorough treatment would also require that we introduce much more of the formalism of topological field theory .",
    "however , we can make two useful remarks .",
    "first of all , for any particle @xmath15 with quantum dimension @xmath78 , one may show that the requirement of trivial spin actually implies the general condition above ( and hence it also implies trivial self - monodromy ) .",
    "secondly , in a number of cases with @xmath79 , we have been able to show explicitly that there are in fact states with trivial monodromy for any number of particles of type @xmath15 .    for the rest of this paper",
    ", we will ignore the general condition and work with condensates of particles with trivial spin and partially or fully trivial self - monodromy .",
    "these conditions seem to be sufficient for the condensate transitions we have studied .",
    "finally let us note that we have asked only for trivial monodromy and not for completely trivial braiding .",
    "this means that in principle , the exchanges in multi - particle states may be represented non - trivially ( with eigenvalues @xmath80 ) , so that the particles would behave in some ways like fermions , though spinless ones .",
    "we could of course exclude this behavior , but this restriction is unnecessary for our purposes and so we will allow for the more general situation .",
    "it turns out that bosons , that is , particles with trivial spin and partially trivial self - monodromy , are a very common occurrence in topological field theories and particularly in the theories that arise from proposed models for topological quantum computation .",
    "let us give a few examples .",
    "the quantum hall effect is currently the only physical system where theory predicts the existence of anyonic excitations in a parameter regime that is accessible in the laboratory .",
    "recently , direct observation of anyonic statistics has been claimed @xcite and much indirect experimental evidence is also available .",
    "anyons with non - abelian braiding are also expected to exist at filling fraction @xmath81 and predicted at a number of other filling fractions , including @xmath82 .",
    "these non - abelian hall states are currently the most experimentally advanced avenue toward topological quantum computation .",
    "hall states are described by chern - simons theory in the bulk of the sample and by a corresponding chiral conformal field theory on the edge . in the case of non - abelian theories ,",
    "the cft on the edge is often better understood than the bulk theory .",
    "the moore - read ( mr ) state@xcite for @xmath81 and its generalizations , the read - rezayi ( rr ) series of states @xcite , which includes a candidate wave function for @xmath82 , are described by an @xmath83 parafermionic cft coupled to a @xmath84 theory describing an electrically charged chiral boson .",
    "electrically neutral excitations of these models may be described more simply using the even spin subsectors of an @xmath83 wess - zumino - witten model .",
    "the @xmath65 wzw - model at level @xmath85 has @xmath86 primary fields which we will label @xmath87 by their @xmath65 weights .",
    "the field labeled @xmath88 corresponds to a topological sector with spin factor given by @xmath89 , with @xmath90 .",
    "in particular , the field labeled by @xmath91 has spin factor @xmath92 , which equals @xmath21 whenever @xmath93 divides @xmath85 .",
    "it also has quantum dimension equal to @xmath21 , so trivial spin is enough to guarantee that this field is a boson .",
    "we may also see directly that this field has trivial self - monodromy , since it fuses to the vacuum sector with itself .",
    "thus the rr - states based on the @xmath65 wzw - theories at levels which are a multiple of @xmath93 all have bosons . if we want to consider excitations that have nonzero electric charge we have to introduce labels corresponding to the @xmath84 part of the cft describing the rr - states , in addition to the @xmath65 labels . taking the full spectrum into account",
    ", we then find even more bosons .",
    "however , the condensation of such charged bosons should lead to superconductivity as well as a change in the filling fraction and so it may be physically more difficult to imagine .",
    "it is perhaps interesting to note that the @xmath94 rr - state , which could describe the hall plateau at @xmath82 , is one of the few low - lying states in the read - rezayi series that does not admit any bosons .",
    "we will present an inventory of bosons in the proposed non - abelian hall states and the expected condensed phases that result from them in a separate publication@xcite .",
    "most of the known local models with anyons are in fact non - chiral ; they have vanishing central charge .",
    "important examples of this class of model are kitaev s toric code models for discrete groups@xcite and levin and wen s string net condensates@xcite ( the loop and dimer models of refs .   can also be viewed as a special case of these@xcite ) .",
    "the toric code models exhibit the same topological order as the discrete gauge theories@xcite , described by a quantum group called the quantum double @xmath95 of the finite gauge group @xmath96 .",
    "we have treated quantum group symmetry breaking in these models in our earlier works@xcite , so we will discuss them only briefly here . in the model with gauge group @xmath96 , topological sectors are labeled by a conjugacy class @xmath97 and by an irreducible representation @xmath98 of the centralizer group @xmath99 of an element @xmath100 of @xmath101 ( the choice of @xmath100 does not matter ) .",
    "the spin factor of the sector labeled @xmath102 is @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the dimension of the irrep @xmath98 .",
    "depending on the group @xmath96 there may be many bosonic sectors , but in general there are two classes of bosons that are always present : the electric sectors which have @xmath105 ( where @xmath106 is the unit element ) and the magnetic sectors which have @xmath107 , the trivial representation of @xmath108 .",
    "it is clear that both electric and magnetic sectors have trivial spin . under fusion",
    ", the electric sectors only produce new electric sectors , so they also have trivial monodromy ( in fact not just for two particle states , but for arbitrary numbers of particles ) .",
    "the purely magnetic sectors may fuse to give sectors which have nontrivial electric charges ( that is , nontrivial centraliser labels ) , called cheshire charges. the sectors with cheshire charge will usually have nontrivial spin and so one may wonder if the magnetic particles are always true bosons .",
    "however , it is not difficult to show that the fusion of identical magnetic particles always contains at least one channel without cheshire charge , so that the requirement of partially trivial self - monodromy is satisfied .",
    "in fact , one may go further and show that the topological hilbert space for arbitrarily many identical magnetic particles always contains at least one state which has completely trivial monodromy .",
    "this state is basically the gauge invariant magnetic condensate state proposed earlier@xcite , but to make contact with the present formalism one must project this onto a subspace of the hilbert space with fixed total topological charge ( for example the space of topological singlets ) .",
    "string net condensates are also described by quantum doubles , but more typically by quantum doubles of quantum groups like @xmath109 and its generalizations .",
    "these models are directly related to doubled chern - simons or wzw - models , with gauge groups @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is now a lie group and the left and right hand copies of @xmath111 occur with the opposite levels , i.e.  these are @xmath112 theories .",
    "the topological sectors of such models are labeled by pairs of representations of @xmath111 that are admissible at level @xmath85 .",
    "the spin of the sector labeled @xmath113 is given by @xmath114 and we see that all diagonal fields @xmath113 with @xmath115 have trivial spin .",
    "the fusion of two diagonal fields always yields at least one diagonal field , so the requirement of partially trivial self - monodromy is also satisfied .",
    "however , as with the case of the toric code , one may show that there are in fact states with totally trivial self - monodromy for any number of identical diagonal fields .",
    "the reason is that the monodromy of any state with @xmath116 diagonal fields @xmath117 may be described using the tensor product of the braid group representation associated with @xmath116 copies of @xmath118 and its dual braid group representation .",
    "this tensor product contains a canonical singlet representation of the braid group and the corresponding state has totally trivial monodromy .",
    "suppose we can change the parameters of the microscopic hamiltonian underlying our anyonic system in such a way that the particle with charge @xmath15 condenses ( @xmath15 should be a boson in order for this to happen ) .",
    "then we can ask what the overall effect of this condensation on the topological excitation spectrum of the system will be .",
    "the basic idea of this paper is that the condensate breaks down a symmetry underlying the spectrum .",
    "that is , before condensation the charge sectors correspond to irreducible representations of some quantum group @xmath5 , the fusion rules are described by decomposition of the tensor products of these irreps etcetera",
    ". then condensation breaks @xmath5 down to a subalgebra @xmath8 and afterward the excitations carry irreps of @xmath8 . when a quantum group is broken down to a subalgebra",
    ", two things generically happen to its irreducible representations .",
    "first of all , some irreps of the original quantum group @xmath5 will not be irreducible as representations of the subalgebra @xmath8 .",
    "these representations will split into multiple irreps of @xmath8 .",
    "secondly , some representations which are inequivalent under the full @xmath5-action will have equivalent @xmath8-actions and hence become identified .",
    "more concretely , all this can be described by _ branching rules _ of the form @xmath119 where @xmath15 is an irreducible representation of the original quantum group @xmath5 , the @xmath120 s are irreps of the algebra @xmath8 that is left after symmetry breaking and the @xmath121 are multiplicities .",
    "we will now make an important conceptual step and put these representation labels and branching rules center stage , forgetting for the moment about quantum groups and their subalgebras .",
    "so assuming that we have a set of labels @xmath122 which characterise the charge sectors of the unbroken theory , as well as fusion rules and spin factors for these labels , then we will say that symmetry breaking means that to each of these labels we associate a branching rule @xmath123 we will call the right hand side of this equation the _ restriction _ of @xmath15 ( we are still thinking of it as the restriction of a representation @xmath15 of @xmath5 to @xmath8 ) .",
    "the @xmath124 are again multiplicities and we have introduced a new notation where instead of labeling the components of the restriction of @xmath15 directly by sectors of the broken theory ( which we think of as labels of irreps of @xmath8 ) , we simply label them @xmath125 , @xmath126 etc .",
    "of course the new labels @xmath127 that occur will most likely not all correspond to distinct sectors of the new theory , for different choices of @xmath15 .",
    "however , the notation introduced here is quite useful in the process of finding out exactly what the new set of sectors actually is .",
    "we want the new labels to be the labels for the excitations of the broken phase , so we will make the physical assumption that they have their own set of fusion rules satisfying the requirements of section  [ sec : tqftsec ] , namely , associativity , existence of a vacuum label and conjugate representations , and a unique way for each conjugate pair of labels to annihilate to the vacuum",
    ". we will not require the new fusion rules to be symmetric , that is , we may allow that @xmath128 for some pairs @xmath129 .",
    "we also do not require a well defined spin or monodromy of the @xmath127 at this point .",
    "the reason that we do not impose these requirements is that we want the new set of labels to capture not only pointlike excitations of the condensate vacuum , but also topological excitations which pull strings or alternatively , excitations which are confined to a boundary between the broken and unbroken phase . the string pulling excitations are expected to be the same as the excitations which occur only on the boundary , since a confined boundary excitation may be visualized as a thread or string extending from the boundary into the broken phase , ending at a string - pulling excitation of that phase .    apart from the requirement that the new theory has sectors with associative fusion and unique duals , there are two more important assumptions that go into the determination of the new set of labels and and their fusion rules .",
    "first of all , the sector that contains the condensed excitation should be indistinguishable from the vacuum sector in the condensed phase .",
    "hence we require that the restriction of the condensed sector @xmath17 of the original theory contains the vacuum label @xmath21 of the new theory .",
    "in other words @xmath130 secondly , we require that the fusion of the old and new labels is compatible with the branching , that is , restriction and fusion commute and we have @xmath131 and @xmath132 the equations above , together with the uniqueness of the unit of the new theory also imply that @xmath133 here , we introduce a slight abuse of notation that we will utilize throughout , namely , if a sector branches to a unique new sector , we will denote the old and new sectors by the same label , as long as the meaning is clear from the context .",
    "the compatibility of fusion and restriction has another important consequence : it implies that the quantum dimensions are preserved under branching , that is , for every label @xmath15 of the unbroken phase , we have @xmath134      we will now give a simple example of how one can determine the set of labels for the broken phase and their fusion rules directly , given the assumptions above . consider the representation theory of @xmath136 at @xmath137 .",
    "this is the quantum group for the @xmath10 wzw model of conformal field theory and for the @xmath65 chern - simons theory at level @xmath93 .",
    "there are five different topological sectors in this theory which are simply denoted by dynkin labels @xmath138 , with @xmath20 denoting the vacuum . the quantum dimensions , spins and fusion rules for these sectors are given in table  [ tab : su24 ] and from this table , we may read off that the sector labeled @xmath93 is bosonic ( we have @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) .",
    "@xmath142    if an excitation in the @xmath93-sector condenses , then @xmath93 will have to branch to the new vacuum and possibly other new labels .",
    "however , since @xmath143 and the quantum dimension of the new vacuum is also necessarily equal to @xmath21 and quantum dimensions are preserved under branching , we find that @xmath144 from here , we may conclude immediately that the restrictions of @xmath9 and @xmath21 must equal each other , since @xmath145 and @xmath146",
    ". also , the restriction of @xmath21 ( or @xmath9 ) can only have one part , because each part would contribute at least a numerical value of @xmath21 to the quantum dimension of the label @xmath21 and the value of this quantum dimension is less than @xmath51 .",
    "now let us look at the fusion of the restriction of @xmath51 with itself .",
    "we have @xmath147 since the vacuum appears twice on the right hand side , @xmath51 must branch into at least two parts ( if there was only one part , it would be able to annihilate with itself in two different ways ) .",
    "since the quantum dimension of @xmath51 equals @xmath51 , this is possible , and in fact there must be exactly two parts @xmath148 and @xmath149 , each with quantum dimension @xmath21 .",
    "note that neither @xmath148 nor @xmath149 can be identified with the vacuum sector @xmath21 , since this would imply the splitting of @xmath21 through the fusion rule @xmath150 and this is impossible , since @xmath151 .",
    "looking back at the fusion @xmath152 we then conclude also that @xmath153 .",
    "we have now completely identified the branching rules for this transition and we turn to the fusion rules .",
    "these are straightforward for the new labels @xmath20 and @xmath21(using  ( [ tensreq ] ) ) , but for @xmath148 and @xmath149 , we have two options , in principle . either these sectors are both self dual , giving @xmath154 , or they are dual to each other , giving @xmath155 . now rewriting equation ( [ eq:2x2 ] ) with our current knowledge",
    ", we see that @xmath156 hence if we assume that @xmath148 and @xmath149 are self - dual , it follows that either @xmath157 and @xmath158 or @xmath159 and @xmath160 . in either case ,",
    "one quickly checks that associativity of the fusion rules is violated , by evaluating @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "hence @xmath148 and @xmath149 must be dual to each other .",
    "now we just have to decide whether @xmath163 equals @xmath148 or @xmath149 ( and similarly for @xmath164 ) . a similar associativity argument as before quickly",
    "yields that we must have @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "hence we can straightforwardly obtain the full new set of sectors , as well their fusion rules .",
    "we summarize these results in table  [ tab : su24broken ]    @xmath167    note that while the fusion rules of the broken theory turn out to be symmetric , we did not put this in by hand and it is in fact just a particular feature of this theory that is not reproduced in general .",
    "not all of the excitations of the broken phase will be pointlike ; some will pull strings in the condensate .",
    "these excitations will be confined , since a string is just a part of the medium where the original symmetry is restored and will cost an amount of energy proportional to its length . the excitations which do not pull a string will be the particlelike excitations of the new phase and they should have well - defined fusion and braiding interactions , in particular well defined monodromies and spin factors .",
    "intuitively , an excitation should pull a string when it has nontrivial monodromy with the condensed excitation , since such nontrivial braiding would lead to a branch cut singularity in the condensate order parameter .",
    "though not very rigorous , it is probably best to say that it is not possible to have a smooth single valued order parameter field enclosing a particle which has a nontrivial monodromy , and that therefore that particle has to pull a string upon entering such a phase .",
    "one expects at least that the presence of the condensate does not interfere with the monodromy of the non - confined particles .",
    "in particular , we expect to be able to assign spin factors to the non - confined sectors by lifting them into the unbroken phase .",
    "the lifts of a sector @xmath16 of the broken theory are just all labels @xmath168 of the original theory that have @xmath16 in their restriction .",
    "a necessary condition for a sector to not be confined is the following :    * if a sector @xmath16 is not confined then all its lifts @xmath169 must have equal spin factors .    in the other direction ,",
    "sectors which do not satisfy this condition will be confined .",
    "note that it is only natural that we should not be able assign spin factors to string - like excitations , since twisting such an excitation leads to a physically observable twist in the string connected to it and we should not expect that such a change can be absorbed by a change of the phase of the wave function .",
    "there are a number of other physical criteria on the set of non - confined particles which we could impose separately , but which in practice turn out to be implied by the simple requirement above in all cases we have investigated .",
    "first of all , the non - confined sectors must form a closed set under fusion , since pointlike excitations must fuse to pointlike excitations .",
    "also , this set must contain the vacuum .",
    "in particular , this means that all lifts of the vacuum must have trivial spin .",
    "this is of course a criterion that is intimately related to the nature of the condensate ; we can impose it already at the symmetry breaking stage , or even view it as part of the definition of a bosonic condensate .",
    "finally , we can go so far as to require that there is a unitary braided tensor category describing the fusion and spins of the set of unconfined excitations .",
    "proving such a thing is beyond the scope of this paper , but again it does turn out to be true in all our examples . also , we would like to stress once more that it is likely that if such a braided tensor category exists , it will actually be fixed uniquely by the fusion and spins of the unconfined sectors .    from our assignment of spin factors , we may derive the monodromy of the non - confined particles using the ribbon equation ( assuming that the set of non - confined particles closes under fusion ) .",
    "the resulting monodromy is just the same as the monodromy of the lifts of the particles .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 be sectors of the broken theory which are not confined and let @xmath170 .",
    "also , let @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 be arbitrary lifts of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 with the property that @xmath174 .",
    "then the monodromy of @xmath171 and @xmath172 in the fusion channel @xmath173 is given by the combination of spin factors @xmath175 , but since the spin factors of the lifts of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are all equal , this factor does not actually depend on the choice of lifts @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 and we may as well write @xmath176 , which is the monodromy of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the fusion channel @xmath17 .",
    "an important special case of this argument is the case @xmath177 . in this case",
    "we are looking at the monodromy of the lifts of @xmath15 with the lifts of the vacuum , which are of course the condensed sectors .",
    "the argument we just gave now says precisely that the lifts of the non - confined particle @xmath15 have trivial braiding with the condensed particles , so we have managed to give a more precise meaning to the intuition about confinement that we mentioned at the start of this section .",
    "we could in fact turn the whole argument above around and start by requiring that all lifts of a non - confined sector should have trivial monodromy with lifts of the vacuum sector ( i.e.  with condensed sectors ) . from that assumption",
    "we can get back to the confinement criterion given above if two conditions are satisfied .",
    "first of all , all lifts of the vacuum of the broken theory should have trivial spin ( we also required this before ) and secondly , it must be possible to obtain all lifts of a sector of the broken theory by fusion with lifts of the vacuum . as we remarked , the first requirement is intimately connected with the nature of the condensate and with the question what exactly constitutes a boson in @xmath178 dimensions . if the second requirement does not hold , then it would seem that we have identified sectors which should be distinguishable .",
    "it is not clear to us at this point whether these two requirements follow from the conditions on the condensate and on the symmetry breaking scheme that we had imposed already , though they do in all our examples . in any case , assuming that these two requirements do hold , we can regain our previous confinement criterion .",
    "any lift of the fusion channel @xmath179 is of the form @xmath180 and the monodromy factor in this lift is @xmath181 . now using the two conditions above",
    ", we see that @xmath182 for all @xmath183 and also , for any @xmath183 , the possible @xmath184 run through all lifts of @xmath16 .",
    "thus for all these monodromy factors to be equal to @xmath21 is equivalent to @xmath185 for all @xmath186 and @xmath85 .",
    "in other words , excitations in the @xmath16 factor are not confined precisely when all lifts of @xmath16 have the same spin factor and we are back at our original criterion .      applying the confinement criterion to our @xmath10 example",
    ", we see that the sectors labeled @xmath20 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 are not confined . for @xmath148 and @xmath149",
    "this is immediate , since they have a unique lift , and @xmath20 lifts to either @xmath20 or @xmath93 , both of which have spin factor @xmath21 . the sector with label @xmath21",
    "is confined , since @xmath21 lifts to @xmath21 and @xmath9 , which have different spin factors ( @xmath187 and @xmath188 respectively ) .",
    "this gives the results in table  [ tab : su24nonconf ] .",
    "@xmath189    this result actually fixes the topological order of the non - confined sector of the broken theory uniquely , since there is only one solution to the consistency conditions for topological field theories ( notably the pentagon and hexagon equations@xcite ) which has these fusion rules and spin factors@xcite .",
    "we have given a description of the spectrum of topological excitations in a theory which has undergone a condensation transition .",
    "we have seen that the broken theory has excitations which are pointlike as well as confined excitations which pull strings .",
    "these confined excitations can exist as boundary excitations , when their strings are attached to a phase boundary , or as ` hadronic ' composites , when two or more confined excitations form a cluster whose overall topological charge is not confined . in such clusters , the confined particles are joined together by their strings .",
    "it is interesting to try and characterize the different types of string themselves in some non - redundant way .",
    "a redundant labeling is given by the set of labels of confined particles .",
    "many confined particles will likely pull the same type of string in the condensate vacuum , since each confined particle can be fused with any non - confined particle to give some other confined particle , and this should not change the type of string that occurs .",
    "therefore , we propose to label the different types of string by equivalence classes of confined sectors modulo fusion with excitations from non - confined sectors . to be more precise , let us introduce an equivalence relation on the sectors of the broken theory as follows ,",
    "@xmath190 we clearly have @xmath191 , just take @xmath17 and @xmath192 trivial .",
    "also @xmath193 , since the definition of the relation is symmetric . finally if @xmath194 and @xmath195 then @xmath196 . to see this , note that from @xmath194 , we have unconfined sectors @xmath197 with @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "similarly , from @xmath195 , we have unconfined sectors @xmath200 with @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath203 and @xmath204 and since @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 are not confined , neither are @xmath209 or @xmath210 , so @xmath196 and we have a good equivalence relation .",
    "the different types of string should be uniquely labeled by the equivalence classes , which are some sort of ` orbits ' under fusion with non - confined excitations . as a check",
    ", we note that all non - confined representations are equivalent to each other , which is what we want , since they all correspond to the situation with no string . to see this note that if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are not confined , then neither are @xmath211 and @xmath212 . but @xmath213 and @xmath214 , so indeed @xmath194 .    for our @xmath10 example",
    "the classification of strings is rather trivial , since there is only one type of confined particle .",
    "hence there are just two classes under the equivalence above , the class consisting of the confined particle @xmath21 , which pulls a string and the class consisting of the unconfined particles @xmath20 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , which pull no string .      in the previous sections we have given general principles for the treatment of the phenomenon of breaking a quantum symmetry @xmath215 through the formation of a boson condensate , as well as a detailed example .",
    "the analysis proceeds in three stages : + 1 . _",
    "criteria for a condensate_. we formulated some criteria that have to be satisfied for a field @xmath17 to be a boson , and to serve as a possible candidate to form a condensate .",
    "two necessary conditions are that it should have trivial spin factor ( @xmath76 ) and partially trivial self monodromy , i.e.  there is at least one fusion channel @xmath216 with @xmath217 .",
    "_ consistent branching_. our analysis is based on the construction of a set of branching rules giving the decomposition of the topological sectors of the unbroken theory into sectors of the broken theory .",
    "we can think of this as branching representations of the quantum group @xmath215 describing the unbroken phase into representations of an intermediate algebra @xmath218 ( whose structure is not discussed a priori ) .",
    "there are a number of consistency conditions on these branching rules that have to be met and these in fact appear to determine the possible branchings uniquely .",
    "a crucial condition is that branching commutes with fusion .",
    "this implies in particular that the total quantum dimension is preserved under the branching rule and that the old vacuum branches into the new .",
    "we furthermore require that the condensate has the new vacuum in its branching .",
    "confinement_. we observe that we can determine which representations in the broken phase have a nontrivial braiding with the condensate , and it is clear that these will pull a string in the new vacuum and hence are confined .",
    "the effective topological low energy theory is then described by the fusion and braiding rules of the non - confined representations ( these must form a closed fusion ring ) and these can then presumably be identified as the irreducible representations of some quantum group @xmath219",
    ".    to our knowledge applying these conditions and performing these steps determines the breaking pattern uniquely . in previous papers on this subject",
    "we restricted our attention mostly to theories described by finite dimensional quasitriangular hopf algebras , especially the so - called discrete gauge theories , whose hidden symmetry corresponds to the quantum double of the discrete gauge group . in those cases",
    "the analysis of the breaking phenomena was done by explicitly considering the algebraic structure of @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "however following that route directly in case one is dealing with representations that carry non - integer quantum dimensions is problematic , and that is why in this paper our analysis is based on the dual route , directly studying the breaking pattern on the level of topological sectors ( representations ) and their branching rules .",
    "indeed , in the explicit example we treated in the previous section of this paper we showed that the present approach , using the branching rules directly , can also be applied to topological systems which have sectors carrying non integer quantum dimensions , for example the systems described by the quantum groups based on quantum deformations of semisimple lie algebras which show up in relation to conformal field theories of the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) type .",
    "this is an important extension of the possible applications of the breaking mechanism which will allow applications in physical contexts like the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "let us uncover some features of the condensate transition that are mostly independent of the details of the topological phase we start with .",
    "one can get surprisingly far with this if the condensed sector is a _",
    "simple current_. a simple current in cft is a primary field @xmath220 whose fusion rules are such that the fusion of @xmath220 with any other field contains only one channel , i.e.  for any primary field @xmath221 , the fusion rule @xmath222 has only one primary field on the right hand side .",
    "we will use the analogous definition in the context of tqft .",
    "it is easy to see that a topological sector labeled @xmath220 is a simple current precisely if @xmath223 .",

    "however since @xmath232 , this is a contradiction and hence @xmath220 is a simple current .",
    "if a bosonic simple current @xmath220 condenses , we can immediately see that the restrictions of a number of fields of the original theory will be identified .",
    "first of all , the fusion powers of @xmath220 all branch to the vacuum .",
    "more generally , for any sector @xmath15 , there is an orbit of @xmath15 under the action of fusion with powers of @xmath220 and the restrictions of the fields @xmath233 in this orbit are all identified .",

    "again , if the components of the restriction are all distinct then there must be at least @xmath261 of them , but in extreme cases , we may have just one component with multiplicity @xmath262 . note that if @xmath17 is a simple current , then @xmath263 , since if @xmath264 , then we would have @xmath265 , contradicting the axiom of fusion that says that sectors can only fuse the the vacuum in a unique way .",
    "also , in the simple current case , one may see easily that the splittings deduced here are a special case of the splittings of sectors in non - minimal orbits discussed before .",
    "similar arguments to the above show that for any pair of sectors @xmath15 , @xmath16 for which @xmath266 , at least one of @xmath15 and @xmath16 must have a restriction which splits .",
    "another case in which splitting of a sectors @xmath15 occurs for arbitrary condensates @xmath17 is if the fusion @xmath267 contains @xmath15 and no other sectors whose quantum dimension is greater than or equal to that of @xmath15 .",
    "of course if @xmath17 is a simple current this just says that @xmath15 is a fixed point . in the general case",
    "the restriction of the fusion @xmath268 must contain at least @xmath269 copies of the new vacuum sector , one from the @xmath17 in @xmath270 and @xmath271 from the copies of @xmath259 in @xmath272 .",
    "now if @xmath15 ( and @xmath23 ) do not split , we see that there must be at least @xmath269 copies of the restriction of @xmath15 in the restriction of the fusion of @xmath267 . however , none of the components of the restrictions of other fields in @xmath267 can be identified with the restriction of @xmath15 , since the quantum dimensions of these other fields are smaller than @xmath32 by assumption .",
    "hence , it follows that @xmath15 must split .      from the examples we have calculated , we observe that the central charges and total quantum dimensions of anyon models seem to follow certain general rules under condensation , if the anyon model that one starts with is _",
    "modular_. modularity is equivalent to the requirement that the monodromy is nondegenerate , that is , for every topological sector @xmath15 there is at least one topological sector @xmath16 such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 have nontrivial monodromy ( see ref .  ,",
    "section e.5 ) . another useful characterization of modularity is that the s - matrix of the theory must be unitary .",
    "this requirement is satisfied for many models that have been studied in physics , for example for all models coming from conformal field theories with bosonic chiral algebras .",
    "however , there are examples where modularity does not apply , notably in systems with excitations which behave like the vacuum under monodromy but which have nontrivial , necessarily fermionic , exchange behavior",
    ". typical examples of such excitations are the actual electrons in quantum hall systems .    given modularity , we observe that    * the topological central charges of the unbroken theory and the unconfined theory are equal * denoting the total quantum dimensions of the original , broken and unconfined theories by @xmath273 , @xmath274 and @xmath275 , we have @xmath276",
    ".    we also note that generally ( independently of modularity ) we have @xmath277 . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will study connections between the quantum group symmetry breaking scheme we have described so far and constructions in conformal field theory .",
    "we will argue that quantum group symmetry breaking in cft is dual to conformal extension of the chiral algebra .",
    "this should also clarify the observation that central charge is conserved .",
    "it appears more difficult to get an intuition for the identity between total quantum dimensions from the cft side .",
    "in an idealized system with topological order , topological quantum numbers can not be changed by the application of any local operator . in other words ,",
    "topological observables are conserved quantities which commute with the full algebra of local observables .",
    "of course in realistic systems , the situation is often more complicated than this .",
    "first of all , the topological features are often emergent only at low energies and different topological sectors of the hilbert space may be mixed by high energy ( virtual ) excitations .",
    "secondly , any real system has a finite size , which implies that a product of finitely many local operators can actually become a topologically nontrivial operator and relate states with different topological quantum numbers . in other words , there is no clean separation between local and topological observables .",
    "however , in the setting of conformal field theory , such a separation does exist . here",
    ", the role of the local algebra is played by the chiral algebra , which can be the virasoro algebra , or some more complicated algebra like a kac - moody algebra or w - algebra .",
    "the hilbert space of the theory splits into sectors on which this chiral algebra acts , but which are not mixed with each other by this action .",
    "these chiral sectors correspond to the topological sectors of the cft .",
    "hence it is natural to expect that there should be a tqft , or modular tensor category , which describes the fusion and exchange interactions of states from the different sectors .",
    "it is also natural to introduce operators for topological charges which commute with the full chiral algebra and one may in fact hope to find a quantum group whose representation category is precisely the modular tensor category that describes the system s topological interactions and which has an action on the hilbert space of the cft that commutes with the action of the chiral algebra .",
    "operators for topological charges can then be the analogs of casimir operators for this quantum group .",
    "while this picture of a chiral algebra and a quantum group with commuting actions seems to be part of the lore of cft , there does not appear to be a detailed mathematical understanding of this picture for general cfts .",
    "we will nevertheless attempt to flesh it out for wess - zumino - witten models in the remainder of this section , and note in advance that the picture just sketched does provide useful intuition about the connection between quantum group symmetry breaking and some well known constructions in cft .",
    "since the quantum group and the chiral algebra are morally each other s commutants , we expect that breaking down quantum group symmetry from a large quantum group to a smaller one should be accompanied by an extension of the chiral algebra on the local side of things .",
    "in fact , we find that there is a beautiful connection between quantum group symmetry breaking and conformal extension of the chiral algebra . in conformal extensions , we start with a chiral algebra that has a representation which is bosonic , but topologically nontrivial",
    ". then we enlarge the algebra by adding an intertwining operator between the vacuum representation and this nontrivial bosonic representation ( i.e.  a creation operator for a topologically nontrivial particle ) . before the conformal extension",
    ", the theory would have a topological ( or more precisely , chiral ) sector corresponding to this bosonic field , but afterwards , this sector has become part of the vacuum sector of the new chiral algebra . on the quantum group side of the story we can interpret this merger of a bosonic sector with the vacuum sector as condensation of the bosonic particle and",
    "describe its effects using the formalism proposed here .",
    "in retrospect , this intuitive argument explains the similarity of some of our constructions and criteria to those mentioned for conformal extensions in moore and seiberg s famous work on the classification of rational cfts@xcite .",
    "since many of the common constructions of cfts , most notably the coset construction@xcite , can be described in terms of conformal extension of the chiral algebra , these constructions now obtain a physical interpretation as being due to condensation of bosonic quasiparticles .",
    "in fact , this suggests that some cft constructions will have a direct physical realization in phase transitions which occur in systems described by cfts .",
    "after this somewhat abstract discussion let us turn to wzw models .",
    "in these models@xcite the physical states are organized into integrable representations of an extended conformal symmetry , a kac - moody algebra based on a finite dimensional lie algebra @xmath111 , at a certain level @xmath85 , which we will denoted as @xmath278 .",
    "these representations correspond to chiral primary fields and there is a finite number of them .",
    "this theory has a central charge equal to @xmath279 with @xmath280 is the dual coxeter number of g. the chiral primary fields are operators which create the lowest energy states of the different topological sectors of the theory from the vacuum and one may obtain the fusion rules and braiding of the topological sectors directly from the cft by calculating the correlators , or more precisely the conformal blocks , of these chiral primary fields .",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between chiral primary fields in the wzw model and irreducible representations of the quantum group @xmath281 , where @xmath282 and in fact , it is known@xcite that the fusion and braid relation obtained in this way are exactly the fusion and braiding of these quantum group representations .",
    "explicit representations of the quantum group in terms of operators acting on the hilbert space of the theory can also be obtained , within the coulomb gas formalism@xcite .",
    "all of this goes a long way toward establishing the picture that we sketched earlier in this section , of a chiral algebra and a quantum group normalizing each other .",
    "the relation between wzw theory and quantum groups is quite useful even as a calculational tool , because many properties of multi(quasi)particle states in conformal field theory , such as their braiding properties , can be determined by just using the properties of the quantum group ( see e.g. ref .  ) . in the remainder of the paper",
    "we will pursue the relation between the breaking mechanism and cft in some detail , exhibiting the connections between the two formalisms in explicit examples , most of them based on wzw theories .",
    "we will find that the breaking of quantum symmetries is indeed closely related to conformal extensions and we will show how well known constructions like the coset construction@xcite , conformal embeddings@xcite and orbifolding@xcite acquire a direct physical relevance and interpretation in the present context .",
    "conformal embeddings are embeddings of affine lie algebras @xmath283 with the property that the central charges are equal , @xmath284 as a result , the corresponding cosets @xmath285 have central charge equal to zero and are therefore trivial .",
    "we will have more to say about this in section  [ sec : cosets ] . here",
    "we will focus on the embeddings themselves .",
    "general ( non - conformal ) embeddings of affine lie algebras do not conserve the central charge , but for all embeddings , the levels @xmath85 and @xmath286 are related by the dynkin index @xmath237 of the corresponding embedding of @xmath96 into @xmath111 , one has @xmath287 .",

    "so one way to understand the conformal embeddings is to say that because the @xmath290 representations are degenerate there is a larger symmetry realized in the spectrum , i.e.  @xmath288 .",
    "interestingly , the ( bosonic ) singlet module of @xmath288 decomposes into bosonic representations under @xmath290 , as we see in the first line of ( [ eq : branchingsu31 ] ) and if we now return to our analysis of section iii we see that it is exactly the nontrivial bosonic component in the branching ( i.e.  the 4 of @xmath291 ) that is assumed to form the condensate .",
    "on the other hand we make the remarkable observation that after breaking and subsequent confinement the residual symmetry @xmath219 , i.e.  the representations and their fusion rules as given in table [ tab : su24nonconf ] are precisely those of @xmath292 !",
    "the conclusion is that there is a unique correspondence between the conformal embedding @xmath296 and the breaking of the quantum group for @xmath297 , where it should be noted that on the side of the chiral algebras , the embedded algebra is smaller , while on the quantum group side the residual quantum group corresponding to @xmath298 is smaller than the one for the embedded alegebra @xmath290 .",
    "all this is in good agreement with our intuition that the fusion algebra is somehow the normalizer of the chiral algebra in the operator product algebra of the cft .",

    "a similar statement holds for all other branchings .",

    "the quantum group symmetry breaking perspective on these cosets adds information to the usual treatment , because , while the effective theory for the non - confined excitations of the coset is of course trivial , the symmetry breaking approach also gives a description of the confined excitations , which we can view as boundary excitations between a phase with @xmath409 topological order and a topologically trivial phase .",

    "these theories can also be realized as conformal field theories , namely as orbifolds of topologically trivial cfts@xcite .",
    "all the topological information in these models can be described using the representation theory of the quantum doubles of finite groups@xcite .",
    "probably the simplest example which allows for non - abelian braiding is the model based on the quantum double @xmath498 of the smallest non - abelian group @xmath499 , the symmetry group of the regular triangle , or equivalently , the permutation group of three objects .",
    "this model has been shown to allow for universal quantum computation , if some measurements are allowed as operations in addition to braiding@xcite .",
    "an implementation of this model using josephson junctions has been proposed in refs .  .",
    "there are @xmath43 topological sectors in the model , each labeled as described in section  [ sec : bosons ] , by a conjugacy class of @xmath499 and a representation of the centralizer group of one of the elements in that conjugacy class ( the elements all have isomorphic centralizer groups ) .",
    "@xmath499 has three conjugacy classes , the class of the trivial element @xmath206 , a class we denote @xmath500 , containing the nontrivial rotations of the triangle ( three - cycles as permutations ) and a class called @xmath501 which contains the reflections ( exchanges ) .",
    "the trivial class has all of @xmath499 as its centraliser , leading to three particle sectors @xmath502,@xmath503 and @xmath504 corresponding to the three irreducible representations @xmath21 , @xmath220 and @xmath98 of @xmath499 . here",
    "@xmath21 denotes the trivial representation , making @xmath502 the vacuum sector , and @xmath220 and @xmath98 denote the nontrivial one dimensional and two dimensional irreducible representations respectively .",
    "the centraliser of @xmath500 is the @xmath505 generated by the rotations , giving sectors @xmath506 and @xmath507 and the centraliser of @xmath501 is a @xmath508 giving two sectors @xmath509 and @xmath510 .",
    "the spin factors and quantum dimensions of these sectors are given in table  [ d3_spintab ] .",
    "[ d3sec ]    @xmath511    the fusion rules of the irreps of @xmath512 have been worked out in ref .  .",
    "for @xmath498 , we have of course @xmath513 ( for all @xmath102 ) and furthermore @xmath514 for the fusion rules of the @xmath515 , we have @xmath516 finally , we have @xmath517 a look at the spin factors and fusion rules confirms immediately that there is a wealth of bosons in the theory . for the odd dihedral groups ( including @xmath499 ) , we have analyzed all possible choices of condensate using our earlier quantum group based approach@xcite and we will not repeat that exercise here .",
    "however , it will be good to check in an example that we can actually reproduce the results obtained there .",
    "this will also serve to illustrate some of the more interesting things that may happen on condensation .",
    "in particular , we will see an example with non - abelian fusion rules after symmetry breaking ( but before confinement ) .",
    "we will investigate what happens when an excitation in the @xmath504 sector condenses . in our earlier treatment of quantum group symmetry",
    "breaking , there were two non - equivalent ways of condensing this sector , because we could choose different ( non gauge equivalent ) internal states of the @xmath504 particles to form the condensate ; note that since all quantum dimensions are integers here , it makes sense to talk about internal hilbert spaces for single particles .",
    "we will find that our current methods produce the same two unconfined theories .",
    "however at the level of the broken theory including confined excitations , we find one extra solution to the requirements set out in this paper , in addition to the two solutions produced by our previous methods .",
    "the extra solution is almost certainly spurious and due to the fact that the requirements we give here are not completely sufficient to determine the broken theory ( before confinement ) in this case .",
    "it is not surprising that this can sometimes happen , since we have restricted our attention to a relatively crude level of description of topological order in this paper , looking only at fusion rules and spin factors . for theories with only integer quantum dimensions",
    "our old methods allow an approach to the problem which makes full use of the underlying hopf algebra theory . also , theories with many integer quantum dimensions can be relatively complicated to handle with the methods of this paper because integers allow for so many different splittings into smaller integers .",
    "now let us sketch the calculations which lead to the above results .",
    "given that @xmath504 condenses , we know that @xmath504 branches to the vacuum sector and some other one dimensional sector . since @xmath518 , it follows that in fact @xmath504 branches to @xmath21 plus the restriction of @xmath503 .",
    "now we have two possibilities : either @xmath503 restricts to the vacuum or it does not .",
    "both possibilities cases lead to a consistent theory for the confined and non - confined excitations .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath503 does not branch to the vacuum , but rather to some nontrivial sector which we will still call @xmath503",
    ". then @xmath519 .",
    "comparing @xmath520 with @xmath521 , we see immediately that all @xmath522 must branch to the same new sector , which we will simply call @xmath523 .",
    "we also see that @xmath524 appears on the right hand side of the fusion rules for the fields @xmath509 and @xmath510 , so these must both split . after completing the calculation , we find the branching given in table  [ tab : dd3broken1 ] .",
    "the unconfined fields are the vacuum , @xmath503 , @xmath525 and @xmath526 .",
    "these have spins @xmath21 , @xmath21 , @xmath21 and @xmath59 respectively and @xmath527 fusion rules , which fixes the topological order to be that of the @xmath508 discrete gauge theory or toric code model . in the discrete gauge theory",
    ", we can interpret the transition as a higgs effect which has broken the @xmath499 gauge group down to a @xmath508 subgroup . on the cft side it looks like we have partially unorbifolded the original theory , leaving a cft where only the @xmath508 subgroup of the @xmath499 is orbifolded .",
    "this could be interpreted as due to extension of the orbifold conformal algebra by some of the chiral primaries for the twisted sectors .",
    "@xmath528    now let us consider the possibility that not only @xmath504 , but also @xmath503 condenses .",
    "in this case the entire electric part of the spectrum becomes trivial , or in other words , the gauge symmetry is fully broken .",
    "as before , we note that the restrictions of the @xmath522 must all be equal and now because @xmath529 , we see that the restrictions of @xmath510 and @xmath509 also equal each other . in the fusion rules",
    "@xmath530 , we see that @xmath531 appears on the right hand side , implying that the @xmath522 split into two parts of quantum dimension @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , from @xmath532 , we see that @xmath509 and @xmath510 split into three parts , also of quantum dimension @xmath21 .",
    "we note that none of the @xmath522 can branch to the vacuum because not all the @xmath522 have trivial spin and they all have the same restriction .",
    "similarly @xmath510 ( and hence @xmath509 ) can not branch to the vacuum . since all sectors after breaking are simple currents , they form a group under fusion .",
    "moreover , one sees easily that the compomnents of the @xmath522 , together with the vacuum @xmath21 , form a subgroup .",
    "if the components of the restriction of @xmath522 were equal , this would have to be a @xmath508 subgroup , but this is inconsistent with the fusion rules of the @xmath522 , so there must be two different components in the restriction of @xmath522 and with the vacuum , these form the group @xmath482 under fusion . from the fusion rules for @xmath509 and @xmath510 we now read off that the three components of the restriction of these fields must also be distinct .",
    "this means in particular that at least one of them is a component that does not occur in the @xmath482 that we already uncovered .",
    "but since we are looking for a group with a @xmath482 subgroup that has at least @xmath93 and most @xmath307 elements , we now have only two possibilities left for the entire group of fields of the broken theory : it is isomorphic either to @xmath533 or to @xmath499 itself . in the first case , the @xmath482 would be the subgroup of even elements of @xmath533 and in the second case , it would be the @xmath482 subgroup of rotations ( or three - cycles in the permutation representation of @xmath499 ) .",
    "it turns out that both options are fully consistent with the fusion rules of the original theory .",
    "also , both lead to the same unconfined theory , namely the trivial theory with one sector ( in other words , all sectors of the broken theory save the vacuum sector are confined ) . however , from basic intuition about discrete gauge theory or toric code models , as well as from our formalism for theories with integer quantum dimensions based on hopf algebra theory@xcite , we know that the correct broken ( but confined ) theory should be the one whose sectors fuse according to the group multiplication of @xmath499 . in other words",
    ", the @xmath533 is the spurious solution to the requirements posed in this paper that we already announced .",
    "the fact that we find a theory with fusion rules described by the group multiplication of @xmath499 is also interesting in itself , since it shows that our formalism can produce boundary theories which have non - abelian fusion rules .",
    "looking at the situation from a cft perspective , it appears that we have fully unorbifolded the theory this time and this might lead one to conjecture that quantum group symmetry breaking accomplishes a sort of inverse of orbifolding .",
    "however , this seems premature and we expect that a more complicated picture emerges when one studies different condensates and orbifolds of topologically nontrivial cfts .",
    "one may envision many constructions of new topological field theories and corresponding conformal field theories based on the principle of quantum group symmetry breaking .",
    "perhaps the simplest thing one may do is tensor a number of known tqfts or cfts together in such a way that the tensor product theory has some bosonic sectors and then condense some or all of these bosonic sectors .",
    "the coset construction is of course a special case of such a construction , but more generally we do nt have to require that the tensor product is of the form @xmath392 with @xmath283 .",
    "it is not difficult to come up with simple examples of such theories which are not cosets .",
    "an example of potential interest in the quantum - hall context corresponds to the product @xmath534 , where @xmath535 is the unitary minimal model at @xmath536 .",
    "after condensation of the single nontrivial simple current in this theory we obtain precisely the spins and fusion rules of the @xmath417 parafermions .",
    "this may be connected with the interface or transition between the spin - polarized moore - read state , which is based on the ising model , and a non - abelian spin singlet state ( nass ) proposed by schoutens and ardonne@xcite , based on the @xmath417 parafermionic cft@xcite .",
    "we will return to this in detail elsewhere@xcite .",
    "there are many other examples one can think of , e.g.  one may take @xmath537 and condense the bosonic simple current @xmath538 , or alternatively , one may take @xmath539 and condense the bosonic simple current @xmath540 .",
    "it is often not at all obvious what the conformal field theories corresponding to these constructions should look like .",
    "for example the case @xmath541 yields topological central charge @xmath542 , but if there is a corrresponding unitary cft , then its conformal central charge can not be equal to @xmath543 , since there is no unitary minimal model with this central charge , and it must differ from @xmath543 by some multiple of @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand , we do expect , in analogy to the chern - simons description of coset theories@xcite , that the topological data for such theories should be described by a chern - simons theory whose gauge group is a quotient of the product of the groups appearing in the construction , with chern - simons terms for these groups at the appropriate levels",
    ". the quotient would be by a finite group characterizing the simple currents which are condensed ( for situations where the condensed sectors are not all simple currents , the situation may be more complicted ) .",
    "if this conjectured chern simons description is correct , then this suggests that a cft with the same topological order can be obtained as a boundary theory of this chern - simons theory .",
    "many constructions of this type could start from products of the form @xmath544 , which are just doubled chern - simons theories , or more generally from products @xmath545 where @xmath5 represents a tqft which is not of the @xmath298 type .",
    "such theories are important in the description of string net condensates@xcite and picture tqfts@xcite . as we discussed in section",
    "[ sec : bosons ] , these theories all have bosons , namely the diagonal sectors with labels of the form @xmath546 .",
    "we should be able to produce many new theories by condensing some of these bosons .",
    "if we condense all diagonal fields , then we should expect that the broken phase is topologically trivial , while the boundary between the broken and unbroken phases will be described by @xmath298 ( or more generally @xmath5 ) itself .",
    "we give an intuitive argument for this first and then sketch a proof .",
    "intuitively , condensing all bosons in the theory should implement the coset construction which in this case gives the completely trivial theory .",
    "the boundary between the completely trivial theory and the @xmath547 theory should be described by an @xmath5 or an @xmath548 theory according to the folding principle for boundaries that we introduced in section  [ sec : embeddings2 ] .",
    "that is , we can think of the @xmath545-theory as just a @xmath5-theory on a plane which has been folded over to give two layers .",
    "the boundary between this folded plane and empty space is not really a boundary on the plane before folding and so it should have the same excitations as the plane itself , in other words , it should be described by an @xmath5 theory or an @xmath548 theory .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath548 theories of course have the same fusion rules but opposite spins .",
    "the ambiguity in the spins explains the complete confinement of these boundary excitations .",
    "one might expect less severe confinement if the @xmath5 theory itself has bosons .",
    "now let us give an argument that comes closer to a proof .",
    "first of all consider the fusions @xmath549 .",
    "since the right hand side has the vacuum in its restriction , we see that the restriction of @xmath550 must be identified with the restriction of @xmath551 .",
    "now more generally , we have that @xmath552 and hence the restrictions of all sectors can be written in terms of the restrictions of the sectors @xmath553 alone , confirming that the broken theory before confinement is simply a single copy of the @xmath5 theory itself .",
    "now let us consider confinement .",
    "in order for the restriction of @xmath553 to be unconfined , we must have @xmath554 . hence unconfined particles have trivial spin .",
    "in fact , unconfined particles should satisfy much more stringent conditions . if @xmath553 is not confined , then for any @xmath555 such that @xmath556 , we must have @xmath557",
    ". however , from this , it follows also that for any @xmath558 , @xmath559 such that @xmath560 , we have @xmath561 and using the ribbon equation , we see that @xmath88 must have totally trivial monodromy with all other fields in the @xmath5 theory . however , this can only happen if the tensor category describing @xmath5 is not modular ( see ref .  ,",
    "section e.5 ) , so we have argued that there is indeed complete confinement if @xmath5 is modular .",
    "perhaps the simplest example of condensation in a doubled theory which does not lead to complete confinement occurs in the doubled ising model .",
    "we label the sectors of the ising model in the usal way by @xmath21 , @xmath562 and @xmath563 .",
    "their spins and quantum dimensions are given in table  [ tab : su22 ] .",
    "the @xmath564 theory has three bosonic fields , the vacuum @xmath495 and the diagonal fields @xmath565 and @xmath566 .",
    "it is possible to have condensation of @xmath566 without condensing @xmath565 .",
    "this leads to the branching in table  [ tab : doubled_ising_broken ] .",
    "the broken theory has @xmath307 sectors and its fusion is the same as that of an @xmath567 tensor product theory .",
    "there are four simple currents , @xmath495 , @xmath568 and the two components of the restriction of @xmath565 .",
    "these are also the unconfined fields and they form a @xmath569 group under fusion .",
    "this is actually not completely straightforward to derive since the requirements for symmetry breaking we have stated in this paper would also be consistent with @xmath570 fusion rules .",
    "however , one may check that the values of the spins of these fields are consistent only with @xmath569 fusion rules and in fact , from the spins and the fusion we see that the unconfined theory has precisely the topological order of a @xmath508 discrete gauge theory or toric code model .",
    "@xmath571    this suggests that in any local model which realizes the doubled ising model one might expect a transition to an abelian topological phase of @xmath569 type .",
    "loop gases with ground states reflecting topological order of doubled ising type have been constructed@xcite , but it has been shown recently@xcite that these loop states can not be ground states of a gapped local hamiltonian .",
    "they are in fact associated with gapless critical points and it is possible to drive the models away from these critical points and into in a gapped abelian topological phase with the same topological order as the @xmath508 toric code or @xmath508 discrete gauge theory",
    ". it would be interesting to study if this can be viewed as due to the condensation of bosonic excitations of @xmath566 type .",
    "we have given some simple principles and requirements relating the spectra and topological interactions of topological phases that may be obtained from one another by condensation of a bosonic quasiparticle , based on the the idea of quantum group symmetry breaking .",
    "these turn out to be surprisingly powerful and practical tools in determining the topological field theory describing the condensed phase from the tqft that describes the phase without condensate and also in describing the boundaries between condensed and uncondensed topological phases .",
    "we have worked out a number of examples in detail and shown connections between our quantum group symmetry breaking scheme and various constructions in conformal field theory .",
    "* more detailed study of systems which are or may soon be accessible by experiment , notably the various proposed non - abelian fractional quantum hall states . *",
    "explicit realization of the predictions on phase transitions in topological models that we make here in local models that exhibit topological phases .",
    "one aspect of this would be the introduction of ( necessarily non - local ) order parameters which signal a non - zero condensate density@xcite .",
    "string - net condensed phases would be a good laboratory for this . * a more mathematically rigorous treatment of the material presented here .",
    "this would hopefully allow for the systematic construction of the full unitary braided tensor category describing the condensed theory .",
    "also one would like to prove some of the observations on @xmath17 and @xmath40 in section  [ sec : observations ] . *",
    "more in - depth treatment of the relation between quantum group symmetry breaking and chiral algebra extension , i.e.  explicit investigation of the action of the chiral algebra on the hilbert space of the cft before and after condensation .",
