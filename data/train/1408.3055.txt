    "tissue engineering , the controlled construction of tissues  cells and their extracellular matrix ( ecm ) environment  is a promising avenue for future biomedical innovations . to realize this possibility",
    ", the dynamic and mutually interdependent relationship between cell and tissue movements has to be understood .",
    "the cytoskeleton as well as embryonic tissues are dynamic structures , capable of both relaxing and generating mechanical stress .",
    "a key , and little explored mechanical component of sustained tissue movement is plastic behavior @xcite  irreversible alteration of the driving force - free tissue shape .",
    "plasticity is clearly important during embryonic development as stresses do not accumulate in embryonic tissues , despite the large deformations .",
    "deformation of physical objects subjected to external or internal forces are usually calculated by the partial differential equations ( pde ) of continuum mechanics  this approach uses spatially resolved mechanical stress and strain tensors as model variables @xcite .",
    "active biomechanical processes are usually modeled using a spatial decomposition and re - assembly method @xcite : if the behavior ( growth , shape change ) of specific parts of the structure are known in mechanical isolation ( free boundary conditions ) , then constraining adjacent parts to form a smooth continuum can yield the deformation of the whole composite structure . in this manner",
    ", one can evaluate how autonomous shape changes in one part of the embryo ( prescribed `` growth laws '' ) can drive tissue movements elsewhere @xcite . in this approach , the cellular origin of the `` growth laws '' is not explained . yet , this is a challenging problem as most often the cellular changes are not just the scaled - down reflections of tissue deformations .",
    "for example , vertebrate embryos elongate substantially during early development , yet cells of the epiblast maintain their isotropic aspect ratio .",
    "therefore , several tissue - level effects are puzzling outcomes of cellular activities , which are `` purposeful '' changes in cell - cell and cell - ecm contacts .    to connect cell activity such as active intercalation or collective migration to tissue movements it is often advantageous to model individual cells and obtain the tissue scale behavior through computer simulations",
    ". widely used models for cell - cell interactions represent individual adherent cells as `` fluid '' droplets , like the cellular potts model @xcite and its grid - free version , the subcellular element model @xcite .",
    "these model choices are motivated by the demonstrated non - newtonian fluid - like behavior of simple cell aggregates @xcite .",
    "cell - based models have been used to formulate hypotheses for cell activity ( such as chemotactic guidance ) and used to develop simulations to obtain tissue movements @xcite .",
    "such models are , however , not yet used to predict mechanical stresses .",
    "furthermore , as discussed recently @xcite these simulations often include biomechanical artifacts such as friction with a non - existing reference frame .",
    "in particular , within the freely floating embryonic cell mass the momentum is conserved ( while the momentum is not conserved when cells can exert traction on an underlying surface ) .",
    "another class of models used to model epithelial morphogenesis is termed `` vertex models '' , in which each cell is represented by a polygon corresponding to the cell membrane @xcite .",
    "the polygon vertices are usually points belonging to the boundary of three adjacent cells .",
    "cell movements are due to the motion of these vertices , which in turn are often assumed to be driven by cortical cytoskeletal contractivity , surface tension due to intercellular adhesion and hydrostatic pressure difference between adjacent cells @xcite .",
    "such models can also include cell neighbor exchange , perhaps the most significant is the t1 transition in which two adjacent cells are separated by the contact of their immediate lateral neighbors .",
    "these models are extremely suitable to describe morphogenetic movements in drosophila @xcite and zebrafish @xcite , where the contractile cytoskelton is localized in a thin cortical layer adjacent the cell membrane .",
    "while most studies utilizing the vertex models are confined to two dimensions , a generalized vertex model which describes cells as three dimensional prisms was also proposed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a cell - resolved , three dimensional off - lattice model of tissue layers that ( i ) does not assume that cytoskeletal contractility is localized in the cortical cytoskeleton , and ( ii ) is computationally simpler than the 3d vertex models . in the model proposed here ,",
    "one particle represents a single cell , but in contrast with similar cell - center or spheroid models @xcite , the mechanical connectivity of the cells are explicitly represented as elastic beams connecting adjacent particles .",
    "the beams can be compressed , stretched , bent and twisted .",
    "therefore , instead of central forces , these links can exert torques and forces that are not parallel to the line connecting the particles .",
    "we assume that the tissue is always in mechanical equilibrium , i.e. , cellular activity ( contraction , rearrangement of the links ) is slow compared to the time needed for the environment to accommodate these changes .",
    "the great advantage of explicit cell - cell contact representation is that we can formulate certain cell activities or plastic stress relaxation as rule sets that specify probabilities for the removal and insertion of links , or alter the equilibrium properties of existing links .",
    "thus , as we demonstrate , convergent - extension movements can be simulated by preferentially creating new links along one direction while removing links in the perpendicular direction .",

    "the plastic behavior of cell aggregates was well studied in a series of experiments where aggegates were compressed in an apparatus where both the compression force as well as the shape of the deformed sample could be precisely monitored @xcite . under these circumstances",
    ", a short compression elicits an elastic ( reversible ) deformation . in this elastic regime",
    "the deformation is homogenous within the aggregate : individual cells are also compressed along one direction . in contrast , when the compression is maintained for several hours , the force needed to maintain the deformation decreases in time .",
    "this decrease is close to exponential , and the behavior is plastic in the sense that after removing the compression force , the aggregate remains in the new equilibrium shape for several hours .",
    "confocal microscopy revealed that cells within the aggregate regained their isotropic shapes  hence they remodeled their intercellular connections .",
    "these empirical findings , including the time scale of the plastic relaxation process , are well reproduced by our model ( fig .  [ fig_relax ] ) .    exponential relaxation of shear stress , characteristic for the maxwell fluid , has been proposed to model embryonic tissues .",
    "such behavior can arise by a sufficient number of cell divisions or apoptoses within the tissue @xcite , or by a mechanical load - dependent remodeling of intercellular connections @xcite . in our simulations , in accord with the continuum theory by preziosi et al @xcite , the stress does not diminish completely .",
    "we attribute this effect to an inherent granularity within the model .",
    "a stretched link is replaced in a t1 transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig_t1 ] ) by the following sequence of events : 1 ) a stretched link is removed .",
    "2 ) the distance between the previously interconnected particles is increased in the new mechanical equilibrium .",
    "3 ) the resulting `` gap '' ( or soft patch ) is filled in by a new link connecting cells in the orthogonal direction .",
    "this last step occurs only if the local deformation in step 2 alters distances to an extent that the two particles that were interconnected by the removed link do not remain voronoi neighbors .",
    "thus , in our model a yield stress , below which the tissue response is elastic , arises naturally .",
    "bell s rule of force - mediated bond dissociation ( [ link_removal ] ) and the corresponding exponential lifetime of adhesion links @xcite is supported by dynamic force microscopy experiments @xcite .",
    "the reported studies indicated a single molecule rupture force ( corresponding to @xmath61 for a single molecule ) around 10 pn .",
    "as a cell may display @xmath134 adhesion molecules on its membrane @xcite , two adjacent cells may be linked by @xmath135 adhesion molecules .",
    "thus , the rupture force needed to separate two cells is 100 nn if we assume that separation breaks each adhesion bond between the two cells .",
    "when cells are pulled apart slowly , a much lower force is sufficient as adhesion molecules can spontaneously unbind : for example , embryonic zebrafish cells can be separated by 10 nn forces @xcite . in our model",
    "the separation of a strained intercellular contact is assumed to be instantaneous ( not resolved by the dynamics ) , we estimate @xmath136 , which in our force units translates into @xmath137 , a value used for simulations in figs .",

    "the emergence of tissue movements from the collective action of its constituent cells is one of the central questions of developmental biology .",
    "imaging studies established that during later stages of development involving a well - crosslinked matrix the cells and their immediate extracellular matrix surroundings move as a composite material @xcite , while during earlier stages individual cell motility is superimposed on a larger scale tissue movement @xcite .",
    "hence the body plan of early amniote embryos do not appear to be established by `` conventional '' cell motility ",
    "i.e. , cells migrating on an external substrate to pre - defined positions following environmental cues . instead , germ layers and the entire embryo morphology are molded to a large extent by cell - exerted mechanical forces ( stresses ) and their controlled dissipation / relaxation .",
    "anisotropic cell behavior has been proposed previously to explain convergent - extension movements @xcite .",
    "here we demonstrated that anisotropic cell activity can be formulated within our proposed model , and the simulations yield velocity autocorrelations comparable with those reported for avian embryos @xcite . in particular , particle image velocimetry revealed that the displacements of morphogenetic tissue movements are smooth in space and tissue movements are correlated even at locations separated by several hundred micrometers , comparable to the size of the embryo .",
    "velocity vectors , however , strongly fluctuate in time .",
    "the autocorrelation time of the velocity fluctuations was reported to be less than a minute .",
    "our model suggest that fluctuations with a short correlation time can be generated by sudden cellular detachment / reattachment events occurring at random positions  the driving mechanism of tissue movements .",
    "the long correlation length is consistent with the idea that the tissue is in mechanical equilibrium , therefore a local change in cell traction is expected to immediately alter tissue deformations elsewhere .    in summary",
    ", we demonstrated that the proposed model yields a realistic elasto - plastic behavior with exponential relaxation of tensile stresses above an intrinsic threshold value . due to the simplicity of the model , microscopic parameter values",

    "the proposed stochastic simulation of cell activities gives rise to fluctuating tissue movements , which exhibit the same autocorrelation properties as the empirically obtained data .",
