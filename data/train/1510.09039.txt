    "supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) are characterized by black body - like spectra with temperatures @xmath0 ev and x - ray luminosities @xmath1@xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the supersoft x - ray emission stems from stable nuclear burning on the surface of white dwarfs ( wds ) , which requires a high mass transfer ( @xmath2 ) from the donor star in an interacting binary .",
    "this leading scenario then involves mass transfer , which is unstable on a thermal timescale , from a more massive main - sequence ( ms ) or subgiant donor star ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "cal 87 is a well known sss in the large magellanic cloud @xcite with x - ray luminosity @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is a close binary with orbital period of @xmath4 hr @xcite .",
    "the wd is very massive with mass @xmath5 @xcite , but the donor mass ( @xmath6 ) is quite low @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that the orbital period of cal 87 was increasing at a rate of @xmath7 ss@xmath8 . a more recent analysis by @xcite refined the value of @xmath9 to be @xmath10 ss@xmath8 .",
    "cal 87 is thought to be the prototype of ssss which predicts a decreasing orbital period , but both the small mass ratio and the expanding orbit do not fit the standard picture of ssss .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have alternatively proposed a self - excited wind model for ssss . in this model ,",
    "the companion star is irradiated by the soft x - rays from the sss , exciting strong winds that drive roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) at a high rate to sustain steady hydrogen burning on the accreting wd , even when the companion star is less massive than the wd . in the binaries with @xmath11 ,",
    "the wind - driven process is expected to be triggered by : ( 1 ) a long phase of residual hydrogen burning after a mild shell flash , ( 2 ) a late helium shell flash of the cooling white dwarf , after the system has already come into contact as a cataclysmic variable @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will examine whether this wind - driven mass transfer model can explain the orbital evolution of cal 87 .",
    "we present an analytical derivation of the mass - transfer rate in section 2 and numerical calculations of this rate in section 3 .",
    "the results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the total orbital angular momentum of a binary is give by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the reduced mass , @xmath14 is the total mass ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the masses of the wd the donor star , respectively ) , and @xmath17 is the binary separation . from eq .",
    "( 1 ) the rate of change of the orbital angular momentum can be derived to be , @xmath18 mass loss from the donor star is composed by two parts , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass transfer rate through rlof , and @xmath21 is the excited wind loss rate from the donor star .",
    "only part of the transferred material from the donor star can be used to increase the wd mass .",
    "the mass growth rate of the wd is , @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the accumulation ratios for hydrogen and helium burning , respectively .",
    "the excess material is assumed to be ejected from the surface of the wd .",
    "the total mass loss rate is then , @xmath25 thus the rate of angular momentum loss caused by the mass loss from the wd and the donor star is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the distances between the wd and the center of mass , and between the donor star and the center of mass , respectively , @xmath29 is the orbital angular velocity .    for angular momentum loss caused by magnetic braking ( mb )",
    "we adopt the saturated law proposed by @xcite and @xcite @xmath30 -k \\omega^3 \\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_{\\sun}}\\right)^{1/2 } \\left(\\frac{m_2}{m_{\\sun}}\\right)^{-1/2 } ,   \\ { \\rm if}\\ \\omega \\leq \\omega_{\\rm{crit } } , \\\\ -k \\omega_{\\rm{crit}}^2 \\omega \\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_{\\sun}}\\right)^{1/2 } \\left(\\frac{m_2}{m_{\\sun}}\\right)^{-1/2 } ,   \\ { \\rm if}\\ \\omega > \\omega_{\\rm{crit } } , \\end{aligned } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath31 g@xmath32 s , and @xmath33 is the critical angular velocity at which the angular momentum loss rate reaches a saturated state .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( 2)-(7 ) we get for the rate of change of the orbital period * :* @xmath34 { \\dot{m}_{\\rm 2tr } } + 2m_1 m_2{\\dot{m}_{\\rm 2w}}}{m_1 m_2 m}+3\\frac{\\dot{j}_{\\rm mb}}{j}. % 3k\\omega_{\\rm c } ( \\frac{r_2}{r_\\odot})^{0.5 } ( \\frac{m_2}{m_\\odot})^{-0.5 } % ( \\frac{4{\\pi}^2}{g})^{2/3 } \\frac{m^{1/3}}{m_1 m_2 } \\times { p_{\\rm orb}}^{-4/3}\\ ] ] as an order of magnitude estimate , if we take the parameters of cal 87 ( i.e. , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath4 hr ) and assume @xmath37 , @xmath38 , then we obtain @xmath39 ss@xmath8 , roughly consistent with the observed value .",
    "figure 1 shows how for the above - adopted masses & orbital period @xmath40 depends on the mass - transfer rate ( left panel ) and for @xmath35 how it depends on the mass ratio @xmath41 ( right panel ) with @xmath42 . in the left panel",
    "it is seen that the orbital period increases when @xmath43yr@xmath8 , and @xmath40 increases with increasing mass - transfer rate . in the right panel",
    "we adopt @xmath35 and @xmath44 .",
    "one observes that the orbital period always increases when @xmath45 , and @xmath46 decreases with increasing @xmath47 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that the soft x - ray radiation from an accreting wd may heat the donor star and produce a strong stellar wind from the heated side of the donor star .",
    "if the wind carries away the specific angular momentum of the donor star , mass transfer will be driven at a rate comparable with the wind loss rate .",
    "the relation between the mass transfer rate @xmath48 and the wind loss rate @xmath49 obeys @xmath50 for @xmath51 ; and @xmath52 for @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 is the efficiency of the wd s spectrum in producing ionizing photons normalized to the case of supersoft x - ray temperatures of about @xmath55 k , @xmath56 measures the luminosity per gram of matter accreted relative to the value for h shell burning , and @xmath57 parameterizes the fraction of the donor s irradiated face and the fraction of the wind mass escaping the system .",
    "taking into account the occurrence of irradiation - excited winds and their influence on the binary evolution , we investigate the mass transfer processes of a binary consisting of a co wd and a ms companion star with an updated version of eggleton s stellar evolution code @xcite . in addition ,",
    "angular momentum loss caused by gravitational wave radiation @xcite and mb @xcite is also included in the calculation .",
    "the growth of the wd mass depends on the accumulation efficiencies of hydrogen- and helium - rich matter .",
    "here we adopt the results of @xcite and @xcite for the @xmath23 , and the prescriptions in @xcite for @xmath24 .",
    "we have performed numerical calculations of the evolution for a grid of binaries . to illustrate the possible formation history of cal 87",
    ", we consider a binary consisting of a co wd of initial mass @xmath58 and a ms companion star of initial mass @xmath59 with an initial orbital period 0.3 day .",
    "the detailed calculated results are as follows .",
    "figure 2 shows the rlof mass - transfer rate ( the black line ) and the wind loss rate ( the red line ) as a function of time .",
    "although less massive than the wd , the companion star is able to transfer mass to the wd material at a high enough rate ( @xmath60 ) , with the help of the excited wind . in figure 3 , we plot the evolution of the donor s mass ( black dashed line ) and the wd s mass ( red dotted line ) .",
    "the wd can finally grow in mass up to the chandrasekhar limit mass and explode as a supernova ia .",
    "figure 4 shows the evolution of the orbital period ( left ) and its derivative ( right ) .",
    "initially mb - induced angular momentum loss causes the orbit to shrink . when the excited wind loss is sufficiently strong , it starts to dominate the orbital evolution .",
    "rapid mass transfer and mass loss cause the orbit to expand with time . at the time @xmath61",
    "yr ( or @xmath62 ) , both the orbital period and its derivative are in agreement with observed values indicated by red dashed lines .",
    "@xcite derived a rate @xmath63 for the change in the orbital period of cal 87 from its eclipse maps . in this paper",
    ", we employ both analytical and numerical methods to show that the excited wind - driven mass transfer model @xcite is able to reproduce observed characteristics of cal 87 . other evidence supporting this model comes from the fact that there is no significant variation of the emission lines of cal 87 even during eclipses , suggesting that the lines are formed in an extended region a circumbinary corona , which could be fed by winds from both the disk and the donor star @xcite .",
    "@xcite also mentioned that cal 87 actually displayed cyclic orbital period changes , with @xmath9 changing from positive to negative value of @xmath64 , and they speculated that the latter may be induced by mb coupled with strong winds .",
    "this would require a very strong magnetic field for the donor star : the negative value of the observed @xmath9 can be accounted for if we amplify the traditional mb - induced @xmath65 by a factor of @xmath66 .",
    "an alternative explanation is that mass loss during the shell burning flashes may decrease the orbital period . assuming that during the flashes a fraction @xmath67 of the accreted matter escapes from the binary system through the outer lagrangian ( @xmath68 ) point , then the angular momentum loss rate is , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the distance between the mass center of the binary and the @xmath68 point .",
    "taking @xmath71 @xcite , we find that when the mass - transfer rate is @xmath72 , the escaping matter may shrink the orbit at a rate comparable with observed .",
