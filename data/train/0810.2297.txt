    "we choose @xmath69 which , in the standard case , would mean that no flavor evolution can occur .",
    "we always assume @xmath49 , which essentially means that the overall strength of the neutrino - neutrino interactions are given by the standard model .",
    "there is an important property which is worth noting : if @xmath70 , then the quantity @xmath71 is conserved .",
    "this property is nothing but the conservation of lepton number found in the standard case  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , one expects to recover the standard dynamics . in the following",

    ", it is useful to monitor also @xmath76 , where the differences with respect to the standard model case manifest more clearly .",
    "to illustrate the effect of nonstandard neutrino - neutrino couplings on the flavor evolution of a neutrino gas we first consider a case in which the matter term @xmath77 . since we have chosen @xmath69 , we assume that only @xmath78 without loss of generality .",
    "we start our discussion of nsi effects referring to values of @xmath79 . in this regime , the terms @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom2 ] ) are sub - leading and it is clear that the new terms have the form @xmath81 .",
    "the nonstandard couplings are expected to play a significant role when the transverse nonstandard term @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom2 ] ) dominates over the vacuum term @xmath83 .",
    "thus , we expect nsi effects to be relevant for interaction strengths @xmath84 . for smaller values",
    ", we expect to recover the standard picture .",
    "however , we note that also smaller values of nonstandard coupling can have an interesting consequence .",
    "if we assume vanishing vacuum mixing , we do not expect any flavor conversion in the standard case , since the polarization vectors are exactly aligned with @xmath85 .",
    "however , in this situation , the nonstandard term transverse to @xmath45 is enough to trigger an instability in flavor space , producing a small offset with respect to the @xmath45 direction .",
    "this is enough to obtain flavor transformations in inverted hierarchy analogous to the standard case  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we initially observe the synchronized oscillations in which the polarization vectors essentially remain fixed to their initial value until the start of the bipolar oscillations , which lead to the inversion of the polarization vectors , conserving lepton flavor number at each step . in normal hierarchy",
    "the system is initially in its stable configuration and the nonstandard effects have no impact .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath86 is represented in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pzbar ] for the case of @xmath87 .    for @xmath88",
    "we observe that a transverse nonstandard component is enough to produce wild oscillations in the system . essentially , the nonstandard interactions act as an external force on the standard system , violating the symmetry that keeps @xmath76 constant .",
    "naively , it seems that the effect can be easily accounted for by going into a frame co - rotating along @xmath72  @xcite : we have just introduced a nonstandard matter potential profile .",
    "the angle between @xmath89now rotating  and @xmath72 is not necessarily small if @xmath72 has a component perpendicular to @xmath89 , even for small vacuum mixing angle . more important , however , is that in this case the initial condition of the neutrino state might be significantly offset compared with the @xmath90 vector , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath91 and @xmath92 might have a significant component orthogonal to @xmath72 , resulting in a large amplitude of oscillation .    in presence of transverse nonstandard terms ,",

    "however , reducing @xmath62 the amplitude of the oscillations diminishes : the decline of the upper envelope of @xmath76 follows the decrease of @xmath95 compared to the vacuum oscillation frequency @xmath96 . referring to the `` pendulum '' analogy  @xcite , the external force introduced by the nsi is initially strong enough to completely dominate the dynamics .",
    "however , as the strength @xmath97 of the external force decreases , it is finally so much weaker than the potential @xmath96 that it can no longer lead to significant oscillations .",
    "if the nsi term is sufficiently strong , the excess in electron neutrinos we started with will relax to complete flavor equilibration .     at the end of flavor evolution as a function of @xmath98 for inverted neutrino mass hierarchy in the vacuum case ( solid curve ) and in presence of matter ( dashed curve ) .",

    "the corresponding behaviour of @xmath75 is shown in fig .  1 for @xmath94 ( central left panel ) for both normal and inverted hierarchy .",
    "at the beginning , it oscillates with full amplitude which is then reduced following the decrease of @xmath62 .",
    "when the nsi effects have saturated and @xmath76 has reached zero , the polarization vectors follow the standard `` pendulum '' dynamics with null lepton number  @xcite . as @xmath101 ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the flavor pendulum tends to zero and in both normal and inverted hierarchy the polarization vectors tend to minimize the potential energy  @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 . in normal neutrino mass hierarchy ,",

    "the resulting behaviour is the total inversion of @xmath105 .",
    "the main effects of a sub - leading nonstandard neutrino - neutrino interaction is thus to produce a flavor equilibration in the ensemble .",
    "we now consider large values of the @xmath51 couplings .",
    "even if from a theoretical perspective these are quite unnatural , the loose experimental bounds on these interactions allow us to play also with these wilder scenarios .",
    "large couplings produce a modulation of the standard neutrino - neutrino term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom2 ] ) .",
    "note that in the extreme case of @xmath106 , the nsi term exactly compensates the standard interaction term . if it were not for the other nonstandard term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom2 ] ) , the system would become linear .",
    "this term produces a precession of the polarization vector @xmath107 around the fixed @xmath51 direction in flavor space , with a speed modulated by @xmath108 . for generic large values of the nsi couplings ,",
    "the motion of the polarization vectors in flavor space is thus a combination of two precessions , one around @xmath109 and the other around @xmath51 , with comparable speed . under this condition ,",
    "the final value of @xmath76 at the end of the evolution is quite unpredictable as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dzvsg ] .",
    "it is determined by the detailed combination of the two different forces that drive the system : in particular , for @xmath110 few @xmath111 , it is mostly the linear non - standard term that matters , while for larger couplings the quadratic corrections are important .",

    "the evolution seems to maintain no track of the standard behaviour .",
    "the nice pendulum analogy , driving the polarization vectors in different directions for the different neutrino mass hierarchies , remains .",

    "we observe that , for @xmath112 , the vectors initially undergo very rapid oscillations .",
    "however , when @xmath119 , the standard matter potential dominates the dynamics and the oscillations only occur around the flavor direction , thus decreasing the flavor oscillation amplitude .",
    "thus , at the end of flavor evolution , the value of @xmath76 saturates .",
    "in this work we have investigated the impact of nonstandard neutrino - neutrino interactions on the flavor evolution of a dense neutrino gas .",
    "first , we have generalized the equation of motion for a neutrino ensemble in presence of nonstandard neutrino - neutrino interaction terms .",
    "then , we have shown that if ordinary matter effects are sub - dominant , flavor - changing neutrino - neutrino couplings lead to a dynamics very similar to the standard model analogue , with the additional feature of a complete flavor equilibration of the neutrino ensemble , both in normal and in inverted hierarchy . including matter effects of the magnitude expected in a realistic supernova environment ,",
    "sub - leading nsi corrections are suppressed by the dominant dense matter effect and a picture similar to the `` standard '' one emerges .",
    "small nsi thus have negligible effects , except for triggering flavor conversions in inverted hierarchy even in the limiting case of @xmath69 .",
    "all in all , we conclude that the phenomenon of collective neutrino flavor evolution in supernovae is generally robust with respect to sub - leading neutrino - neutrino interactions of the four - fermion type .",
    "potentially large effects can arise for values of the nonstandard neutrino - neutrino couplings comparable to the ordinary ones , which are phenomenologically allowed but theoretically disfavored .    still , to make the problem tractable we made several approximations compared to a realistic physical system .",
    "let us conclude this section by speculating on possible consequences of our findings in more realistic environments .",
    "for example , in some situations the ordinary matter effect might be weak enough for sub - leading nsi effects to affect the dynamics .",
    "perhaps the most notable example is in o - ne - mg sn progenitors with rapidly decreasing density profiles , where in particular the neutronization burst might be affected  @xcite .",
    "also , peculiar time - dependent signatures in the supernova neutrino burst could be produced by non - negligible nsi effects , since , at least at sufficiently late time after core bounce , the nonstandard neutrino - neutrino term could dominate over the dense matter term in the low - radii region .",
    "another physically interesting environment is provided by accretion disks formed by coalescing neutron stars , where emitted neutrinos propagate in a region of relatively low matter density along the disk axis  @xcite .",
    "nonstandard interactions could play some role in this context , perhaps with an impact on the gamma - ray burst production by neutrino - neutrino annihilations in such engines .",
    "also note that a more realistic treatment of the problem might require a detailed three - flavor study , which goes beyond our present purpose .",
    "further directions of investigation may be related to the presence of nonstandard neutrino - charged fermion interactions .",
    "their impact on matter transitions in supernovae has been explored in different works . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that these could induce new effects just above the neutrino sphere .",
    "their impact on the collective neutrino flavor evolution still remains to be characterized .",
    "finally , we would like to remark that this study assumes that the nonstandard effects do not affect the formation of the neutrino spectra and the dynamics in the supernova core .",
    "it has been argued in  @xcite that sufficiently large nsi of neutrinos with sn matter may lead to drastic changes in the core electron fraction and neutrino spectra . since the nsi considered here do not enter directly into the weak equilibrium , nor enhance neutrino - nucleus collisions , one would naively guess that at least for sufficiently small @xmath120 their effects should be sub - leading .",
    "of course , a definitive proof of this working hypothesis would require detailed supernova simulations , including nonstandard interaction effects in the dynamics of the core - collapse .",
