    "we include also the lla corrections to the main condensates of dimension @xmath64 , which are due to nonlocal structure of the vector condensate .",
    "we demonstrate that while the lla corrections provide substantial changes of the values of vector and scalar nucleon self - energies @xmath65 and @xmath66 , these changes are to large extent compensated by the terms @xmath67 , which are beyond the lla .",
