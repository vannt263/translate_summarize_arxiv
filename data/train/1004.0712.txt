    "supersymmetry imposes certain restrictions on the non - supersymmetric models of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "a well known example of such restrictions is the fact that the supersymmetric version of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics requires at least two higgs superfields .",
    "meanwhile , for cosmology einstein equations have to be solved , therefore the supersymmetry embedding of the higgs model inflation requires local supersymmetry , _",
    "i.e. _ supergravity .",
    "thus , one can try to see how the potential discovery of supersymmetry may affect various models of inflation , derived in the past in the context of general relativity coupled to scalar fields without supersymmetry .",
    "it would be interesting to find general restrictions , as well as to study particular models .",
    "here we are motivated by a particular issue in cosmology , the so - called @xmath10 coupling , which attracted a lot of attention starting from the early days of inflation @xcite .",
    "recently , it became also quite important in the context of sm inflation @xcite .",
    "until now , the @xmath0 , @xmath1 supergravity action in an arbitrary jordan frame described by the frame function @xmath11 , with arbitrary khler potential @xmath12 , holomorphic superpotential @xmath13 and holomorphic function @xmath14 , was not known . here",
    "we will derive this action , which is the first goal of this paper .",
    "this will be achieved by starting with the superconformal theory developed in @xcite , and by gauge - fixing all extra symmetries in order to get a general supergravity action in jordan frame .",
    "our results generalize the formulation of @xmath0 supergravity in jordan frame for the particular case in which the khler potential @xmath15 and the frame function are related by @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding action in jordan frame was derived in components in @xcite , and in superspace in @xcite . in our treatment , we will also specify the conditions required for the frame function to make the kinetic terms of the scalar fields canonical in the jordan frame .",
    "the non - minimal coupling of scalar fields to curvature is allowed by all known symmetries of the sm and general relativity .",
    "if one tries to describe the early universe using the particle physics sm coupled to gravity in the einstein frame , one finds that : 1 ) the coupling @xmath17 of the higgs field has to be of the order @xmath18 ; 2 ) the mass of the higgs field has to be of the order @xmath19 gev",
    ". these conditions may be satisfied in a general theory of a scalar field , but not in the simplest version of the standard model .",
    "however , if the @xmath10 coupling is included , _",
    "i.e. _ if the embedding of the particle physics sm into the jordan frame gravity is considered , a satisfactory description of cosmology for the higgs mass in the interval between @xmath20 and @xmath21 gev can be found @xcite .",
    "this is possible for very large values of the non - minimal scalar - curvature coupling @xmath22 .",
    "the model predicts the cosmological parameters @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , which are consistent with cosmological observations .",
    "thus , this model provides very interesting predictions , which will be testable both at lhc and by a planck satellite .",
    "when this work was in progress , a very interesting proposal @xcite was made how to generalize the model of bezrukov - shaposhnikov @xcite in presence of supersymmetry . under certain assumptions , it was found that slow regime inflation is not possible within the supergravity embedding of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , but rather it is possible for the nmssm ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a recent review of nmssm ) .    in the present paper",
    "we will study the supergravity embedding of the nmssm and look for a consistent cosmological models of the higgs - type inflation .",
    "firstly , we will derive the complete @xmath0 action in the general jordan frame , where it is very simple and has interesting features .",
    "this will help to clarify the meaning of the large non - minimal @xmath10 coupling in the context of supergravity .",
    "in particular , the origin of the canonical kinetic terms of all scalars of the nmssm in the jordan frame is explained , whereas in the einstein frame scalar kinetic terms are generally very complicated .",
    "secondly , we will study the theory as a function of all three chiral multiplets , namely two higgs doublets and a singlet , and analyze various directions in the space of scalar fields .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it was shown that a slow - roll inflationary regime is possible in nmssm when the higgs fields move in the @xmath25-flat direction of the two higgs doublets @xmath26 and @xmath27 , assuming that the gauge singlet @xmath28 is small .",
    "however , it was not clear whether this last assumption is justified , _",
    "i.e. _ whether @xmath29 corresponds to a minimum of the potential with respect to the field @xmath28 when inflation takes place in the @xmath25-flat direction of the two doublet higgs fields",
    ". we will show that , unfortunately , the potential of the field @xmath28 has a sharp maximum near @xmath29 in this regime .",

    "<S> the theory has a modified geometry , and it exhibits a significant dependence on the frame function @xmath3 and its derivatives over scalars , in the bosonic as well as in the fermionic part of the action . under certain simple conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the scalar kinetic terms in the jordan frame have a canonical form .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider an embedding of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) gauge theory into supergravity , clarifying the higgs inflation model recently proposed by einhorn and jones . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the conditions for canonical kinetic terms are satisfied for the nmssm scalars in the jordan frame , which leads to a simple action . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the gauge singlet field experiences a strong tachyonic instability during inflation in this model . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a modification of the model is required to support the higgs - type inflation .    </S>",
