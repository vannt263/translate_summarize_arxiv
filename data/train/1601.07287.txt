    "claim 2*. @xmath221 is a closed set of the interval @xmath234 $ ] .",
    "+ the argument is identical to the one in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem a ) : it is proved by contradiction , using the sequential characterization of closed sets ; first it is assumed that the graphical condition in @xmath221 is not satisfied , which contradicts claim 1 ; then the graphical condition and the continuity gives the reflection condition in @xmath221 .",
    "* claim 3*. the minimum of the set @xmath221 is @xmath235 .",
    "+ we argue by contradiction .",
    "suppose @xmath236 .",
    "we will show that then there exists @xmath237 such that @xmath238 , contradicting that @xmath239 is the minimum of @xmath221 .",
    "+ again , we divide the proof into two steps .",

    "moreover , there is no point in @xmath243 with normal vector included in @xmath29 .",
    "if there were such a point , let us say that its first coordinate is @xmath244 , then by the tangency principle at the boundary , @xmath245 , that is , @xmath246 would be a plane of symmetry of @xmath17 . in particular , @xmath246 would be a plane of symmetry of the curves @xmath185 and @xmath186 , which contradicts that @xmath247 also is .",
    "thus , @xmath248 as @xmath17 is compact , we have that there exists @xmath240 such that @xmath249.\\ ] ] from this fact , together with the compactness of @xmath17 , it follows that @xmath215 can be represented as a graph over the plane @xmath29 for every @xmath250 $ ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath241 is a graph over @xmath29 and the proof of this step is complete .",
    "_ step 2 _ : there exists @xmath251 such that @xmath252 .",
    "+ we are going to show that there exists @xmath253 $ ] such that @xmath254 which in particular implies that @xmath252 , and this step will be proved . + we argue by contradiction .",
    "if it were not true , then there would exist an increasing sequence @xmath255 converging to @xmath239 such that @xmath256 for each natural @xmath257 , denote by @xmath258 a point in the above set . at this point",
    ", we make two key observations : @xmath259,\\ ] ] @xmath260 follows from step 1 , that is , from the fact that @xmath241 is a graph over @xmath29 for every @xmath261 $ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath262 where @xmath263 , simply because , in plain language ,      where orientation ( right and left ) is considered with respect to the plane @xmath29 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the definitions , in particular from the meaning of being a graph over a plane .",
    "+ on the other hand , follows from the fact that @xmath242 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath264 were a set bigger than @xmath265 , then , as @xmath266 , there would be a first point of contact between @xmath267 and @xmath268 , which would be in the interior because the boundary of @xmath17 consists of two strictly convex plane curves symmetric with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "then by the interior tangency principle both surfaces would coincide , hence @xmath269 would be a symmetric plane of @xmath17 , a contradiction .",
    "+ let us come back to the sequence @xmath270 . by the compactness of @xmath17",
    ", we can assume without loss of generality that this sequence converges to a point @xmath271 .",
    "indeed , since @xmath272 , @xmath273 , where the last equality is by . on the other hand , from we see that @xmath274 for each @xmath257 .",
    "thus , @xmath275 , which contradicts that @xmath276 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath17 must be between the two parallel planes @xmath18 and @xmath19 can not be dropped , as the following counterexample shows .",

    "observe that the intersection of each of these planes with @xmath277 consists of two concentric circles .",
    "the counterexample is the piece of @xmath277 between these two planes and whose boundary is the inner circle in @xmath18 and the outer circle in @xmath19 .",
    "simply note that , by theorem [ thm : translators_and_symmetries ] , @xmath17 is symmetric with respect to any plane @xmath29 containing the direction of translation @xmath7 . therefore , @xmath17 is a hypersurface of revolution around @xmath7 .",
    "observe that in this case the translator lies below the plane @xmath53 that contains the curve @xmath64 because @xmath17 is compact and , as a translator , its height function can not attain a local maximum ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.1 ( d ) ) .",
    "hence , the same argument using the alexandrov s method proves the corollary .",
    "let @xmath17 be a connected compact embedded translator in @xmath0 whose boundary @xmath64 is a @xmath278-sphere contained in a hyperplane @xmath53 orthogonal to @xmath7 .",
