    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method has constituted an efficient and powerful numerical method for solving time - independent many - body schrdinger equation mainly in chemistry and solid state physics @xcite . among various approaches to qmc namely ,",
    "random walk , diffusion , green - function etc , variational quantum monte carlo ( vmc ) has been extensively studied in recent years @xcite . in vmc method",
    ", a parameterized many - body trial wave function is optimised according to raleigh - ritz variation principle . in practice , this task is done utilizing a numerical algorithm for optimisation the parameters .",
    "various algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the framework of qmc such as newton @xcite , steepest descent ( sd ) @xcite , perturbative optimisation @xcite and linear optimization method @xcite .",
    "the wave - function optimisation is implemented via two schemes namely _ energy minimisation _ and _ variance minimisation_. these methods have their own merits and disadvantages .",
    "a basic task in vmc is the evaluation of first and second derivatives of the local energy @xmath0 respect to variational parameters and spatial coordinates or a combination of them ( @xmath1 is the trial wave function ) . despite normally the first derivative",
    "is analytically evaluated and the second derivatives are calculated numerically @xcite there are papers in which second derivatives are also calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "numerical evaluation of second derivatives causes a systematic error into the problem . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the sd method has only been utilized in the variance minimisation approach @xcite .",
    "our objective in this paper is to show that implementation of the sd method in the direct approach of energy minmisation yields reasonable results .",
    "we report our results for the ground state energies of he , li , be , b and c atoms and compare them to the results in the literature obtained by other methods .",
    "let us briefly explain the basic ingredients of the vmc method . in the vmc method a trial many - body wave function @xmath2 containing a set of @xmath3 variational parameters @xmath4 is considered .",
    "@xmath5 denotes the position set of electrons .",
    "we confine ourselves to born - openheimer approximation in which the nuclei are assumed static and only the electronic degrees of freedom are taken into account .",
    "the parameters @xmath6 are varied according to the raleigh - ritz variation procedure so as to minimize the variational energy @xmath7 defined as follows :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the many body system hamiltonian .",
    "we ignore relativistic correction and take the hamiltonian as follows ( in hartree atomic units ) :    @xmath10    small letters refer to electrons and capital ones to nuclei .",
    "@xmath11 is the electric charge of the @xmath12-th nucleus and @xmath13 denotes the distance between electron @xmath14 and electron @xmath15 whereas @xmath16 denotes the distance between electron @xmath14 and nucleus @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , we restrict ourselves to real - valued wave function @xmath1 and omit the complex conjugate symbol afterwards . by introducing a local energy @xmath17 and a normalized probability distribution function",
    "@xmath18 we recast equation ( 1 ) in the following form :    @xmath19    it is now possible to approximate the integral by the standard monte carlo procedure :    @xmath20    @xmath21 denotes the local energy of the @xmath22-th sample of the configuration - space and @xmath23 is the number of monte carlo sampling for evaluation of the integral .      the next step is to find the optimal values of the parameters which minimise the objective function i.e. ; the variational energy @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "there exists numerous optimisation methods such as newton @xcite , steepest descent @xcite , conjugate gradient etc in the literature .",
    "here we focus on the simplest of them and show that despite simplicity algorithm is capable of exhibiting a satisfactory performance despite not receiving much attention .",
    "we briefly recall the main ingredient of this method .",
    "having numerically computed the energy @xmath24 for a given set of parameters in ( 4 ) , we iteratively update the values of the parameters according to the following procedure :    @xmath25    the vector @xmath26 denotes the parameters , @xmath27 is the iteration step and @xmath28 denotes the constant of the sd method .",
    "the vector @xmath29 is the gradient vector of energy respect to the parameters .",
    "we note that in some cases we should vary the sd constant in each iteration step to get the desired optimum value . in order to utilize sd method",
    ", we should evaluate the energy gradient vector .",
    "this has been done in details in @xcite .",
    "we only quote the result :    @xmath30    in eq .",
    "( 6 ) @xmath31 denotes the logarithmic derivative of wave function evaluated in the @xmath22-th mc configuration .",
    "if the constant @xmath28 is appropriately chosen the sequence @xmath32 converges to @xmath33 after some iterations .",
    "we wish now to introduce the structure of the trial ground state wave function we have implemented in our calculations for simple atoms .",
    "we have taken the following well - known form for @xmath1@xcite :    @xmath34    in which @xmath35 and @xmath36 are up - spin and down - spin slater determinants and @xmath37 is the jastrow factor .",
    "the number of spatial orbitals @xmath38 in the construction of slater determinant @xmath39 equals the number of spin up ( down ) electrons and depends on the atom we consider . note that @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of electrons in the atom . for the basis set in the construction of up and down",
    "slater determinants we have used a variant of slater - type @xmath22 and @xmath42 orbital as follows @xcite :    @xmath43    @xmath44    analogous definitions goes for @xmath45 and @xmath46 orbitals .",
    "we have set @xmath47 in all our calculations . henceforth , the parameters are @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 . for the jastrow factor",
    "we have taken the following form :    @xmath51    the sum goes over all the particles ( electrons ) and @xmath52 has the following dependence on distances :    @xmath53(\\frac{r_{ij}}{1+r_{ij}})^o\\ ] ]    @xmath54 is the distance between electron @xmath14 and the nucleus , @xmath13 is the distance between electrons @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "exponents @xmath55 are positive integers and the sum over @xmath56 denotes the sum over given values of these integers .",
    "we adopt the following choice of integers @xcite @xmath55 : @xmath57 @xmath58    equation ( 11 ) includes electron - electron correlations ( terms with @xmath59 ) , electron - nucleus correlations ( @xmath60 as well as one of @xmath61 or @xmath62 zero ) and also electron - electron - nucleus correlations ( ( 2,0,2 ) and ( 2,2,2 ) terms ) .",
    "here we have considered the simplest choices compatible with electron - electron and electron - nucleus cusp conditions .",
    "the origin of three body correlation terms in ( 11 ) stems in the back flow correlation firstly suggested by feynman and cohen @xcite .",
    "we refer the readers for more details to reference [ 25 ] .",
    "the jastrow function has nine independent parameters @xmath63 .",
    "each @xmath22 type orbital contains twelve parameters and in a @xmath42 orbital we have six parameters .",
    "we note that after imposing electron - nucleus cusp conditions , one parameter from each @xmath22 orbital will be fixed .      in the preceding sections",
    ", we outlined the basics of energy minimisation method . in this method , we minimise the variational energy . in recent years , an alternative scheme the so - called _ variance minimisation _ has been introduced @xcite and has become one of the most frequently used method in the literature .",
    "this method has shown to provide some advantages over the straightforward energy minimisation .",
    "we now briefly review this method . instead of energy ,",
    "we minimise the variance of the local energy @xmath64 @xcite :    @xmath65    all the other steps are analogous to those in the energy minimisation method . to implement the sd procedure we only should replace the energy gradient vector with the variance gradient vector .",
    "derivatives of @xmath66 respect to parameters have been evaluated in @xcite . here for simplicity we use the following expression which ignores the change of the wave function @xcite :    @xmath67    more concisely the above approximation corresponds to underweighted variance minimisation method .",
    "the average is taken with the normalised probability function @xmath18 .",
    "we can approximate the average in ( 14 ) by a sum in mc approach .",
    "note that when implementing this method , we have to replace @xmath24 with @xmath66 in the gradient vector @xmath68 in equation ( 5 ) . in the next section our results will be reported .",
    "all the computational details of the calculations are explained in the appendix .",
    "we have implemented the steepest descent optimising method to find the ground state energy and wave function of atoms he , li , be , b and c by two approaches of energy and variance minimisation .",
    "let us now explain our procedure of energy minimisation .",
    "it consists of three steps : _ anticipating _ the variational parameters , _ finding the optimised value _ of steepest descent parameter @xmath28 and eventually the _ fine tuning _ of variational energy .",
    "step one begins with random initialization of the parameters values .",
    "initial values of jastrow parameters are randomly chosen in vicinity of zero .",
    "we then set the sd constant @xmath28 to a rather high value say @xmath69 .",
    "next we proceed with some iterations of ( 5 ) until the variational energy reaches approximately to the exact ground state energy .",
    "this comprises step one . during this step integrals in ( 1 )",
    "are evaluated by the standard mc metropolis method .",
    "each mc move consists of a random selection of an electron and displace it from its position by the vector @xmath70 .",
    "the move size which is the length of @xmath70 is randomly chosen ( uniformly ) from the interval @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the direction of @xmath70 is uniformly chosen between zero and @xmath72 .",
    "we took the number of monte carlo steps @xmath23 equal to @xmath73 .",
    "we discard the first @xmath74 steps to ensure reaching equilibrium .",
    "averages are separated by @xmath75 mc steps to suppress the effects of correlations among generated mc configurations .",
    "the mc maximum move size @xmath76 has been typically @xmath77 ( hartree atomic units ) with the acceptance ratio around @xmath78 percent . at the end of step one , which normally takes @xmath79 iterations ,",
    "variational parameters should have reached to the vicinity of their ultimate values .",
    "we put their latest values in the code and re run it .",
    "this is the beginning of step two .",
    "we then proceed with some iterations until the iteration series of the variational energy begins to diverge .",
    "this shows that by the current value of the sd parameter we can no more reach the true energy .",
    "here we reduce @xmath28 to a smaller value say one order of magnitude smaller and repeat the procedure until the iteration series of energy begins to diverge or strongly oscillates .",
    "we repeat this @xmath28 reduction procedure until further reduction of the sd constant @xmath28 does not lead to divergence of energy iteration series . normally after @xmath80 repetitions we achieve our aim and @xmath28 reaches to a value of the order @xmath81 .",
    "this marks the end of step two and by now we have an iteration energy series . in figure",
    "( 1 ) we have depicted such series of be ground state energy obtained in the method explained above .",
    "corresponding series for other atoms are similar in nature .",
    "it is seen that after roughly @xmath75 iterations we reach a steady state regime .",
    "next in figure ( 2 ) we exhibit the dependence of absolute value of @xmath82 on the iteration number .",
    "vs iteration number.,width=283 ]    we see that @xmath83 tends to a small value for a sufficient number of iterations .",
    "theoretically it should goes to zero but due to numeric computations it does not approach to zero .",
    "finally in third step , in which the fine tuning of energy in performed , we choose the variational parameters obtained from that iteration in the series which has the smallest energy and re run the code for these values of parameters for a longer mc run of @xmath84 steps to find the energy in a fine tune manner .",
    "all the reported values in table i have been obtained in this way . in figure",
    "( 3 ) the energy error is shown for both methods of energy and variance optimisation .",
    "we recall that the error has been obtained from the following formula :    @xmath85 ^ 2-e^2}{n_{mc}-1}}\\ ] ]        we see that the error is lower in variance minimisation method . in both methods , the error decreases as we increase the iteration number . in table",
    "i , we report the ground state energies we have obtained and compare them both to the existing computational results in the literature obtained by other methods @xcite and the exact ones @xcite .",
    "the comparison shows that the steepest descent method is capable of minimising the energy to a very good precision .",
    "in fact our results by energy minimisation method is in most of the cases even better than those reported in @xcite .",
    "besides be , in all the atoms , our energy is comparable to the dmc energy .",
    "this marks the efficiency of the steepest descent method at least for light atoms .",
    "we should like to emphasize that simplicity is the main merit of our approach which can turn it into an efficient method al least for simple atoms .",
    "our results obtained by variance minimisation method is less favourable in comparison to our energy minimisation ones .",
    "however , the error in the energy minimisation method is larger .",
    "comparison of our variance minimisation results to those in @xcite ( which have been obtained by vmc in newton optimisation method ) shows that the results of @xcite is slightly better than ours .",
    "we have also compared our results to the recent paper of brown et al @xcite in which besides single determinant , multideterminant trial wave function have been employed .",
    "it is seen that the accuracy of our results is comparable to those exhibited in @xcite .",
    "in summary we have applied the steepest descent optimisation method to optimise the parameters of the qmc many - body wave - function in some light atoms .",
    "two schemes of energy and variance minimisation have been implemented .",
    "the key features to achieve the correct minimum is to vary the sd constant @xmath28 appropriately .",
    "our results are in a well agreement with exact results and those obtained by dmc .",
    "we note that all the derivatives of the trial wave function respect to spatial coordinates and variational parameters have been analytically calculated .",

    "let us first consider @xmath64 .",
    "according to its definition we have :      the first term is kinetic energy and @xmath89 represents the potential energy . calculating @xmath89 is straightforward .",
