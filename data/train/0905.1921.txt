    "we use the weighted mean proper motion for checking , whether the two objects show common proper motion below .",
    "we calibrated the naco data using the wide binary star hip 73357 for our two measurements in 2006 and 2007 .",
    "the astrometric calibration for our images was done relative , hence the error bars of separation and position angle given in table  [ tab2 ] include possible orbital motion of the binary inbetween our observations as well as their measurement uncertainties .    to determine the positions of both components we constructed a reference psf from both objects .",
    "thus , we obtained an appropriate reference psf for each single image . by using idl / starfinder we scaled and shifted the reference psf simultaneously to both components in each of our individual images by minimizing the residuals . as a result we obtained positions ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) and relative photometry ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) including realistic error estimates for each object by averaging the results of all single images taken within each epoch .    from separation in figure [ fig2 ] , we can exclude by 3.4@xmath2 that ct cha b is a non - moving background object .",
    "due to the location of the companion ( northwest of a ) and the proper motion ( towards northwest ) , the position angle information does not give much additional significance ( 1.0@xmath2 deviation from the background hypothesis ) , hence resulting in a combined significance of 3.7@xmath2 .",
    "for a k7 star and a sub - stellar companion ( see below ) and the given separation ( at @xmath9 pc ) , the orbital period is @xmath10 yrs , so that the maximum change in separation due to orbital motion ( for circular edge - on orbit ) is @xmath11 mas / yr or @xmath12 pix / yr ( @xmath13/yr in pa for pole - on orbit ) . neither in separation nor in position angle ( measured from north over east to south ) , being @xmath14 , signs of orbital motion could be detected given the short epoch difference ( @xmath11 year ) .",
