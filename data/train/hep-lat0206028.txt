    "analogous expressions are valid for staggered and nave fermions .",
    "the expectation value of an operator @xmath15 is defined by the feynman path integral @xmath16 where terms regarding gauge fixing have been skipped as they are inessential for our analysis . after integrating out fermions ( we assume that @xmath15 can be expressed in terms of gluon fields only ) we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the pure gauge action and @xmath19 is the fermion matrix @xmath20 colour , flavour and",
    "spinor indices are placed where required . the theory with @xmath21 colours and fermions in the fundamental representation in general yields a complex value for @xmath22 if @xmath23 .",
    "this is a problem because importance sampling in the monte carlo integration of  eq.([vevo ] ) can not be applied with a complex weight .",
    "several solutions have been proposed that allow to perform the integration in an approximate way or in particular regions of the @xmath0@xmath1 diagram : reweighting methods  @xcite , calculation of the canonical partition function from simulations at imaginary chemical potential  @xcite , analytical continuations of taylor expansions in powers of imaginary chemical potential  @xcite , responses of several observables to a nonzero small chemical potential  @xcite and fugacity expansions  @xcite . here",
    "we present another idea that should work for small values of the chemical potential .",
    "we will prove that if we restrict our attention to the calculation of expectation values of cpt invariant operators then the correct boltzmann weight under the path integral is @xmath24 .",
    "the boltzmann weight in eq.([vevo ] ) , @xmath25 , is a complex number . however",
    "the expectation value of any observable represented by the operator @xmath15 in  eq.([vevo ] ) must be a real quantity . imposing",
    "that @xmath26 be real for any observable @xmath15 is a strong constraint on the integration measure .",
    "clearly all possible configurations can be gathered in sets such that the contribution to the imaginary part of @xmath26 from all configurations in one single set cancels out .",
    "we shall assume that all sets are formed by only two configurations and that these two are related by some transformation s. firstly we want to find this transformation .",

    "we will write this dependence wherever necessary .",
    "these conditions are sufficient to guarantee that @xmath26 is real .    a simple way to enforce the last constraint in  ( [ conditions ] )",
    "is by imposing that s is a discrete transformation .",
    "@xmath30 means @xmath31 where each single factor @xmath32 is the haar measure over the gauge group . by a discrete transformation we mean",
    "that s does not transform each single haar measure .",
    "in fact this would entail a jacobian and the search of the transformed configuration would become more difficult .",
    "the matrix @xmath33 has the property @xmath34 .",
    "this stems from the relation @xmath35 must be used but the result is the same .",
    "we use the euclidean definition of the gamma matrices such that @xmath36 holds . ] .",
    "notice that this implies re det@xmath19 ( i m det@xmath19 ) is an even ( odd ) function of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover it is physically clear that applying a charge conjugation operator c changes the sign of @xmath1 .",
    "then we expect that the condition @xmath37 = \\left(\\det d[{\\cal c}]\\right)^*$ ] can be verified if s contains the transformation c. however the above condition is only part of the requirements in  ( [ conditions ] ) .",
    "in particular we see from the second condition in  ( [ conditions ] ) that the implementation of c must be such that the pure gluon action @xmath18 remains unaltered .    in order to leave @xmath18 invariant ,",
    "the correct transformation should involve some space  time rearrangement besides charge conjugation .",
    "a reasonable guess is the cpt transformation that we define in the following way : if our lattice was @xmath38 dimensional and the lateral sizes were finite and equal to @xmath39 , @xmath40 , ... ,",
    "@xmath41 ( in units of lattice spacing ) then the cpt transformation would act in the following way @xmath42 where mod(@xmath43 ) gives the remainder on integer division of @xmath44 by @xmath45 .",
    "this is the finite volume version of @xmath46 .",
    "this transformation fulfils all conditions in  eq.([conditions ] ) as a straightforward computation shows .    as an example",
    "let us check that @xmath18 is invariant under cpt .",
    "it is enough to show that under the action of cpt every plaquette of the original configuration @xmath27 maps onto one and only one plaquette of @xmath27 .",
    "let us denote @xmath47 the plaquette starting at the site @xmath44 and going around through direction @xmath48 and then @xmath49 .",
    "this is @xmath50 . applying transformation  ( [ ld ] ) on each factor we obtain @xmath51 which , by the cyclic property of the trace , is equivalent to the plaquette @xmath52 in the original configuration @xmath27 .",
    "this is clearly a one  to ",
    "one mapping from plaquettes to plaquettes in @xmath27 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "then a configuration @xmath27 with weight @xmath53 transforms under cpt into another configuration @xmath54 with weight @xmath55 and the same haar measure .",
    "this means that both configurations have the same odds to be selected by an updating algorithm .",
    "if moreover we restrict our interest only to cpt invariant observables @xmath15 then we can say that the numerical value @xmath56 $ ] appears with a probability proportional to @xmath57)\\left(\\det d[{\\cal c } ] + \\left(\\det d[{\\cal c}]\\right)^*\\right)$ ] . barring a factor 2 and dispensing with",
    "the cpt transformed configuration one can just count @xmath27 with the weight @xmath58 .",
    "this is the main result of our paper .",
    "when we say cpt invariant operators we mean that the operator @xmath15 is cpt invariant configuration by configuration .",
    "most of the operators are cpt invariant after averaging over configurations ( i.e. the corresponding observable is cpt invariant ) , but our constraint is stronger than this .    focusing our attention only on cpt invariant operators still allows to study several interesting problems . indeed the average plaquette , chiral condensate , polyakov loop , etc .",
    "can be calculated by evaluating expectation values of cpt invariant operators . on the other hand space ",
    "time valued operators @xmath59 are in general not permitted because our method requires that the equality @xmath60 holds configuration by configuration which in general is not true . in particular",
    "all correlation functions are not admissible .",
    "are there other discrete transformations such that the imaginary part of the determinant is eliminated within groups of two configurations ?",
    "we have performed the following test .",
    "we discretized a 2dimensional gauge theory does not present the problems discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the density of energy obtained with this action on the lattice is @xmath61 , the same result than in the continuum .",
    "however this is irrelevant for the purpose of the present test and we used the action in eq.([action ] ) . ] on a @xmath62 lattice and loaded it with an arbitrary configuration ( an arbitrary @xmath63 matrix on each of the 8 links ) .",
    "we calculated @xmath22 obtaining a complex number .",
    "then we rearranged the 8 @xmath63 matrices in all possible ways ( 8!=40320 ) and for each permutation we placed them again on the 8 links and recalculated the determinant . only the transformation described in  ( [ ld ] ) yielded the result that satisfies conditions  ( [ conditions ] ) ( permutations of the 8 links that can be viewed as spatial or temporal translations led to the same result but they are clearly uninteresting ) .",
    "we conclude that there are no other simple discrete transformations providing the complex conjugate of the original configuration weight .",
    "for the importance sampling to work it is necessary that the weight be positive ( it must behave as a probability ) .",
    "however re @xmath22 can take negative values and this fact limits the applicability of the method . by continuity",
    "we expect that re @xmath22 is positive in the majority of configurations when @xmath1 is small enough .",
    "this suspicion is confirmed by numerical simulation . in  @xcite results from a simulation with 4 flavours of staggered fermions",
    "are presented .",
    "a @xmath64 lattice is used at @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in fig .  1 we show the fraction of configurations with a positive ( negative ) weight @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) as a function of @xmath69 ( @xmath70 is the total number of configurations ) .",
    "it indicates that our method can be used at moderate values of @xmath1 .",
    "this may include the region in the phase diagram @xmath0@xmath1 where present and future heavy ion experiments ( rhic , lhc ) are going to be run ( large @xmath0 and small @xmath1 ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations with the weight re @xmath22 would be greatly facilitated if we were able to find a new matrix @xmath71 such that re @xmath72 because then fast and well  known simulation methods for fermions  @xcite could be used .",
    "we have not found a general and efficient algorithm to construct the matrix @xmath71 starting from @xmath19 .",
    "consequently we have to resort to algorithms which explicitely calculate the determinant of @xmath19 .",
    "we shall not insist in these aspects of the problem as they will be analysed in a future publication containing several numerical studies  @xcite .",
    "we have proved that the correct boltzmann weight for updating full qcd in lattice simulations at finite chemical potential is @xmath73 where @xmath18 is the pure gluon action and @xmath19 is the fermion matrix .",
    "we have shown that this is true when we calculate expectation values of operators that are cpt invariant .",
    "for other operators our proof does not work .",
    "possibly in this case the assumption that the imaginary part of the boltzmann weight is eliminated by combining couples of configurations should be relaxed .",
    "nonetheless the class of cpt invariant operators include many observables usually studied in the context of finite density systems .",
    "our algorithm has two problems which deserves further improvement : on one hand the weight  ( [ we ] ) is not positive in general .",
    "we have shown that it is mostly positive for moderate values of the chemical potential .",
    "on the other hand the present method requires the explicit calculation of the determinant of the fermion matrix @xmath19 which is very time consuming . in a future publication  @xcite we will give numerical results obtained by using eq.([we ] ) .",
