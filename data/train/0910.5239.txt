    "to account for self - driven motion as observed in biological systems , an additional degree of freedom , called the `` internal energy '' @xmath2 , was introduced in the context of complex systems theory ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "first interpretations of this formalism were given with respect to animal movement and complex motion of particles in general .",
    "it describes particles who can convert their internal energy @xmath2 into mechanical energy and thus exhibit complex movement .",
    "various applications of this model were studied extensively , e.g.  in swarm theory @xcite .",
    "dynamics of a particle with position @xmath3 and momentum @xmath4 undergoing active motion as discussed in @xcite are @xmath5 where the evolution of the internal energy @xmath2 is given by the equation @xmath6 the @xmath7 remain constants to be fixed .",
    "the first integral of the active dynamical system reads @xmath8 which can be viewed as a generalization of the classical energy equation . in the context of active motion",
    "the particle is not simply driven to the minimum of the potential @xmath9 , its internal energy allows it to exhibit self - driven movement .",
    "+ depending on the structure of the potential , the systems shows various complex motion patterns , which can be studied analytically by bifurcation theory and numerically by just simulating the evolution of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 in time .",
    "so far , explicit investigations were done only for harmonic potentials ( see @xcite for a detailed study of the nonlinear dynamics ) .",
    "one can naturally ask for active motion of particles driven by gravitational interactions . we will now give a formulation of this problem within the framework of friedmann equations .",
    "the friedmann equations for the dimensionless normalized cosmological scale parameter @xmath10 , describing the spatial evolution of a flat , homogeneous and isotropic universe with cosmological constant @xmath11 read @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the density parameters of matter and radiation at present time @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the density parameter of the cosmological constant .",
    "@xmath18 per definition and @xmath19 denotes the current hubble parameter .",
    "if we introduce the following potential @xmath20 then the analogy with a classical dynamical system of a single particle with coordinate @xmath10 and energy @xmath21 is evident . according to general relativity",
    "the constant @xmath22 is related to the spatial curvature of the universe which , however , is taken to be zero due to recent observations .",
    "the density parameter of @xmath11 is fixed by the friedmann equation ( [ dup ] ) which at present time @xmath16 gives the relation @xmath23 we now want to propose a new phenomenological model for the development of the universe which is based on the active generalization of the conventional friedmann equations .",
    "the _ active friedmann equations _ are given by    @xmath24    where @xmath25 are arbitrary but fixed real constants .",
    "for notational convenience we have chosen @xmath26 as the corresponding constant for the first order integral in ( [ num3 ] ) .",
    "differing from the conventional case we allow for a non - vanishing @xmath22 in the active context , which has to be determined yet .",
    "we first have to assign specific values to the density parameters of matter / radiation and the cosmological constant .",
    "notice that we ca nt set @xmath27 , since this results from equation ( [ omega ] ) , which looks different in the active formulation , namely @xmath28 which is derived from equation ( [ num3 ] ) by setting @xmath16 .",
    "the constant @xmath22 can be fixed by demanding that the current acceleration @xmath29 of the universe in the active scheme should agree with the acceleration value given by the conventional friedmann equations ( thus accounting for the experimental result @xmath30 ) .",
    "for any fixed @xmath31 one finds @xmath32 accordingly , @xmath33 so that @xmath34 is now completely determined by the density parameters of matter / radiation and the initial condition for @xmath2 , which is freely chosen .",
    "depending on this initial condition @xmath34 may also be brought to vanish .",
    "figure 1 shows a simulation example of the active dynamics of the normalized cosmological scale parameter @xmath10 .",
    "we observe oscillatory behavior with significantly smaller amplitudes and shorter periods in the past .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath10 is oscillating around a certain equilibrium point , which can be calculated analytically .",
    "the active friedmann equations can be rewritten as follows : @xmath35 equilibrium points are found by searching values @xmath36 , for which the right hand side of ( [ crit ] ) vanishes .",
    "equilibrium points with @xmath37 are unstable , the case @xmath38 leads to the conditions @xmath39 for the specific choice of parameters and initial conditions made for the simulation shown in figure 1 , the numerical values of @xmath36 can be calculated directly .",
    "the quartic equation for @xmath40 has only one positive , real - valued solution , namely @xmath41 , resulting in @xmath42 .",
    "figure 1 shows that this value of the scale parameter marks the center point of the oscillations .",
    "the stability analysis of the above equilibrium point @xmath36 can be made by linearizing the system ( [ crit ] ) and calculating the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix .",
    "our calculation shows the presence of a purely imaginary pair of eigenvalues @xmath43 and we are near a hopf bifurcation point ( for bifurcation theory , see @xcite ) . in our case @xmath44 , so that the period of oscillations is given by @xmath45 in units of the hubble time @xmath46 , which agrees well for large times with our numerical simulation .",
    "+   +    , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "( these are rough representative values for the density parameters , consult @xcite for a recent overwiev of cosmological parameters . )",
    "this choice of parameters leads to @xmath54 . ]    summarizing , we can say that interpreting the friedmann equations as a nonlinear dynamical system and handling it within the framework of active motion results in oscillatory solutions for the scale parameter .",
    "hence we succeeded in constructing a model for a cyclic universe giving rise to a sequence of expansions and contractions without any singularity , yet accounting for the observed spatial flatness and the current accelerated expansion . besides this particular example , the active friedmann equations allow for a lot of other possible scenarios which deserve further analysis . whether the active universe represents a reasonable model for cosmology will depend on finding a physically meaningful interpretation of the additional parameter @xmath2 .",
    "attempts can be made to identify its effect with corrections arising e.g. from cosmological theories with extra dimensions , which will be the task of future investigations .",
