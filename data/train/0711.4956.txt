    "meson decays to hadronic final states without a charm quark are an important probe of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "the so - called charmless decays play a key role in testing the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) predictions of charge - parity ( ) violation , with sensitivity to the three angles @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the unitarity triangle .",
    "the dominant contributors to this class of  decays are `` penguin '' decays mediated by @xmath5 and @xmath6 process involving a virtual loop with the emission of a gluon and the ckm - suppressed @xmath7 tree diagram . due to the presence of an extra strange quark",
    ", the first diagram contributes only to final states containing an odd number of kaons ; while the latter two result in final states with no , or an even number of , kaons",
    ". penguin decays provide an ideal environment to look for new physics ( np ) with possible contributions from non - sm particles in the loop , while the interference between tree and penguin amplitudes ( of comparable magnitudes ) allows to search for direct  violation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , studies of these decay processes can be used to constrain varieties of theoretical models of  decays based on factorization , perturbative qcd , and su(3 ) flavor symmetry .    in these proceedings",
    ", we summarize most recent results on charmless hadronic  decays  @xcite culminating in three - body , quasi - two - body ( q2b ) , or other multibody final states ; studied using  collision data collected with the  detector  @xcite near the  resonance .",
    "the results should be considered preliminary , unless a journal reference is given .",
    "the challenge in studying charmless hadronic  decays is to extract a small signal ( typical branching fraction is of the order of @xmath8 ) out of a sea of background events .",
    "the continuum light - quark production , @xmath9 , forms the most dominant background component .",
    "it is suppressed by exploiting the difference in event topology -  mesons are produced almost at rest resulting in a spherical event , while the light - quark pairs tend to have a jetlike shape owing to the large available kinetic energy - and by utilizing flavor and decay - time information of  meson candidates .",
    "particle identification plays a crucial role in separating charged pions from kaon track candidates .",
    "this becomes particularly important against the background emanating from  decays with similar hadronic final states .",
    "backgrounds from final states with charm quarks are suppressed by invariant - mass vetoes on charmonia and @xmath10 mesons .",
    "the signal yield is extracted by performing an unbinned maximum - likelihood ( ml ) fit to event - shape variables ( usually combined to a fisher discriminant @xmath11 or an artificial neural network nn ) , and kinematic quantities that make use of precise beam - energy information and energy - momentum conservation .",
    "the kinematic variables are the difference  between the energy of the reconstructed  candidate and the beam energy ( @xmath12 ) , and the beam - energy substituted mass @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the momentum of the  candidate [ here all quantities are calculated in the  rest frame ] . where available , the invariant - mass and angular variables of q2b resonances are used to further enhance background suppression . for signal modes with a significant yield , the  violation or charge asymmetry is measured using @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to the number of @xmath18 (  or @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) decays detected in the inclusive yield , respectively .",

    "figure  [ kkpifig](a ) shows the  distribution of selected candidate events , following a signal - enhancing requirement on the likelihood ratio which is formed out of  and nn variables .",
    "points show the data , the dark filled histogram shows the  background and the light filled histogram shows the  background .",
    "approximately half of the signal events appear to originate from a broad structure peaking near 1.5@xmath31  in the @xmath32 invariant mass distribution ( see figure  [ kkpifig](b ) ) .",
    "this structure is reminiscent of similar states observed in dalitz plot analyses of @xmath33  @xcite and @xmath34  @xcite , and is likely to be of great interest for the understanding of low energy hadronic bound states  @xcite .",
    "results on the @xmath35 mass spectrum are in reasonable agreement with a dedicated q2b analysis  @xcite that has put the most stringent upper limit ( ul ) on @xmath36 and a first ul on @xmath37 at @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ( all quoted uls are computed at 90% confidence level ) .",
    "the measured charge asymmetry is found to be consistent with zero .",
    "decays.__,title=\"fig : \" ]   decays.__,title=\"fig : \" ]    we report the observation of the @xmath6 penguin - dominated vector - vector decay @xmath40 at 6@xmath29 significance  @xcite with a sample of 383 million  pairs .",
    "figure  [ kstkstbarfig ] shows  and  projections of candidate events with a requirement on the signal - to - background likelihood ratio , calculated excluding the plotted variable .",
    "points with error bars show the data , the solid line shows the projection for signal - plus - background , the dashed line is the continuum background , the hatched region is the signal , and the shaded region is the  background . performing a simultaneous likelihood fit",

    "the branching fraction measurement is consistent with theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath43 value agrees with the model expectation of qcd factorization  @xcite , which predicts it to be @xmath44 in the vector - vector decay of a pseudoscalar ( @xmath45 here ) .",
    "we have also improved the existing ul on the sm - suppressed decay @xmath46 by two orders of magnitude to @xmath47 .      using a data sample of 383 million @xmath48 events",
    ", we measure the branching fractions and  violation asymmetries  @xcite of hadronic decays @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 refers to either a kaon or a pion .",
    "the @xmath52 is detected via its self - tagging decay mode @xmath53 .",
    "table  [ ksthhtab ] summarizes results of these measurements .",
    "we have made three new observations in the final states @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in the sm - suppressed decay @xmath57 , where a branching fraction comparable to or larger than that of the @xmath56 mode would be a signature of np ,",
    "no signal is observed and a first ul is set at @xmath39 .",
    "we find no evidence for  violation in these @xmath49 decays .    0.1 in    ._measured signal yields , branching fractions ( @xmath58 ) , significance ( @xmath59 ) and  violation asymmetries ( for the significant modes ) of @xmath60 .",

    "is pioneering several new measurements in charmless hadronic  decays that probe the sm in two orthogonal directions - the weak interaction by measuring the ckm angles  @xcite , and the strong interaction by exploring low - lying hadronic bound states and by providing precision tests of qcd models .",
    "we eagerly look forward to the last run , which together with data taken during the year 2006 - 2007 and not used in the presented results , would double the dataset",
    ". this will be crucial for realizing other rare hadronic decay modes such as @xmath61 within our reach .",
