    "the mechanism driving the emergence of a quantum macroscopic order that is able to resist to the decoherence effect of high temperatures remains a major topic of research in condensed matter .",
    "the realization of this macroscopic quantum phase in doped cuprates close to the mott insulator regime has stimulated a large amount of investigations on the physics of strongly correlated metals .",
    "most of theoretical papers treated models of a homogeneous system made of a single electronic band ( or models of multiple hybridized bands reduced to a single effective band ) , with a large hubbard repulsion .",
    "there is a growing agreement that the solution of the problem of high-@xmath2 superconductivity requires the correct description of the normal state where spin , charge , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedoms compete , with the formation of nanoscale puddles of spin density wave stripes , puddles of charge density wave stripes , and/or puddles of ordered mobile oxygen interstitials .",
    "a lot of researchers feel very strongly that the minimum model to capture the essential physics of high - temperature superconductors needs to take into account both the presence of  two electronic components with different orbital symmetry \"  @xcite , and a  nanoscale phase separation \"  @xcite involving also the spatial segregation of the charge density , the orbital symmetry , and the lattice local symmetry  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a multiband model is needed to describe the functional superconducting phase emerging in a complex system with multiple electronic components .",
    "@xcite the effects of strong correlations in multiband systems were actively treated using the hubbard model .",
    "@xcite a particular interesting feature of the multiband hubbard model is that it predicts the emergence of phase separation .",
    "@xcite    in 1994 a topological lifshitz transition  @xcite was first proposed to appear around 1/8 doping in cuprates  @xcite and a theory for high-@xmath2 superconductivity based on the shape resonances between a bcs - like superconducting gap and a second gap in the bec - bcs crossover regime in the new appearing band was formulated .",
    "@xcite there is now compelling experimental evidence that the high temperature superconductivity emerges in the proximity to a topological lifshitz transition .",
    "@xcite    here we provide a theoretical model for the phase diagram region where the nanoscale phase separation emergences in a two - band scenario of two strongly correlated electronic fluids in the proximity of a topological lifshitz transition ( so called 2.5 order transition ) .",
    "this simple model captures the key physics of the anomalous normal phase in cuprates exhibiting the phase separation as a function of charge density and the energy splitting between the two bands .",
    "this provides an additional insight into specific features of superconducting phases in different cuprate families , i.e. , the new 3d phase diagram where the critical temperature depends on the doping and misfit strain between the active atomic layers and the spacer layers .",
    "@xcite there exists an evidence of two types of phase separation in cuprates ( a ) the phase separation in the underdoped regime , near the mott phase , between a hole - poor antiferromagnetic phase and a metallic hole - rich phase and ( b ) the phase separation between two metallic phases , namely , between a hole - poor phase with doping close to 1/8 and a hole - rich phase with doping close to 1/4 .",
    "the cuprates at optimum doping present the second type of phase separation as we have proposed before .",
    "@xcite recently it has been found that some cuprate systems like la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 show scale invariance of the distribution of oxygen interstitials that suggests a scale invariant phase separation typical of a system near the critical point . therefore , it is possible that the criticality in la@xmath0cuo@xmath3 results from a quantum critical point .",
    "@xcite we discuss the phase diagram of a two - band system as a function of two variables : the charge density and the energy shift between the two bands . in this phase diagram , we first determine a line of quantum critical points for a lifshitz transition of the type  appearing of a spot \" of a new sheet of the fermi surface when one more band comes into play .",
    "second , we identify the electronic phase separation for two strongly correlated bands in the proximity of the line of lifshitz transition . finally , we identify the critical point , where the phase invariance in the coexistence of the two phases appears .",
    "this last point is proposed to be a possible explanation for the regime of scale invariance in nanoscale phase separation in high-@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "the existence of the two types of the strongly correlated charge carriers in cuprates can be described in terms of the two - band hubbard model .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system can be written as  @xcite @xmath4 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the creation and annihilation operators for electrons corresponding to bands @xmath7 at site @xmath8 with spin projection @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the symbol @xmath11 denotes the summation over the nearest - neighbor sites . the first term in the right - hand side of eq",

    "the last two terms describe the on - site coulomb repulsion of two electrons either in the same state ( with the coulomb energy @xmath17 ) or in the different states ( @xmath18 ) . the bar above @xmath19 or @xmath9 denotes _ not _ @xmath19 or _ not _",
    "@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the assumption of the strong electron correlations means that the coulomb interaction is large , that is , @xmath20 .",

    "the half - width @xmath27 of @xmath12 band is larger than @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the number of the nearest neighbors of the copper ion ) . due to the electron correlations , the relative width of @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands can vary significantly  @xcite .",

    "the equations of motion for the one - particle green s function with the hamiltonian eq .   include the two - particle green s functions .",
    "however , in the limit of strong on - site coulomb repulsion , the presence of two electrons at the same site is unfavorable , and the two - particle green s function is of the order of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 . in turn , the equation of motion for the two - particle green s functions includes the three - particle terms , which are of the order of @xmath42 and so on .",
    "we use for the two - particle green s functions the hubbard i approximation and neglect the terms of the order of @xmath42 . in so doing , we get a closed system for the one- and two - particle green s functions  @xcite .",

    "the lifshitz transition is a common feature of many types of superconductors and in its neighborhood the standard bcs approach is hardly applicable .",
    "the situation here bears a similarity with the bec  bcs crossover widely studied in the physics of ultracold atomic systems . in the specific case of strongly correlated electron systems including two bands ( two types of charge carriers ) , the shift of the chemical potential due to the relative shift of the bands and/or the variation of charge density implies the relevant renormalization of the effective width of both bands .",
    "this strongly nonlinear renormalization leads to the electronic phase separation . since in the high-@xmath2 superconductors",
    "an increase of the critical temperature occurs at a substantiable distance from the lifshitz transition , it is tempting to associate the region of the phase separation with that corresponding to high values of the critical temperature .",

    "( 4 ) intragrain high-@xmath2 superconductivity is controlled by the  shape resonances \" between a first bcs condensate and a second condensate in the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "therefore , further essential details are needed to investigate in the scenario of multi - condensates superconductivity in the regime of percolation superconductivity corresponding to establishing the long - range coherence in scale - free networks .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we have shown that the synthesis of a two - band strongly correlated  multi - condensate superconductor \" , where a first bcs condensate in a large fermi surface coexists with a second condensate at the bec - bcs crossover in a new appearing small fermi surface ( like in cuprates and iron - based superconductors )  @xcite should also exhibit an intrinsic arrested nanoscale phase separation .",
    "in fact , this type of complex superconductivity appears in a two - band metal at a critical distance from the topological lifshitz transition .",
    "moreover , the control of long - range coulomb interaction  @xcite , determined by the screening in the different materials surrounding metal units , is a needed key parameter to bring the system to a self - similar phase  @xcite , which will also promote  @xcite the high-@xmath2 superconductivity .",

    "<S> the arrested nanoscale phase separation in a two - band hubbard model for strongly correlated charge carriers is shown to occur in a particular range in vicinity of the topological lifshitz transition , where the fermi energy crosses the bottom of the narrow band and a new sheet of the fermi surface related to the charge carriers of the second band comes into play . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the phase separation diagram of this two - band hubbard model as a function of two variables , the charge carrier density and the energy shift between the chemical potential and the bottom of the second band . in this phase diagram , we first determine a line of quantum critical points for the lifshitz transition and find criteria for the electronic phase separation resulting in an inhomogeneous charge distribution . finally , we identify the critical point in presence of a variable long - range coulomb interaction where the scale invariance of the coexisting phases with different charge densities appears . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this point is relevant for the regime of scale invariance of the nanoscale phase separation in cuprates like it was first observed in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 . </S>"
