    "different mechanisms for initiating such a self - phoretic motion exist but still the details have not been fully understood yet ( see , for example , the discussions in @xcite ) .",

    "spherical active colloids @xcite and sphere - dimers @xcite are able to swim by self - diffusiophoresis , where a gradient in chemical species close to the surface generates a pressure gradient along the surface and thereby fluid flow @xcite",
    ".    water droplets can become active and move in oil by consuming bromine fuel supplied inside the droplet .",
    "the bromination of mono - olein surfactants at the water - oil interface induces gradients in surface tension and thus marangoni stresses , which initiate surface flow and thereby self - propulsion @xcite .",

    "surfactant micelles are crucial to initiate the spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "when swimmers depend on fuel , they stop moving after it has been consumed . instead of supplying fuel in the solution , permanent illumination with laser light as a power source can sustain self - propulsion for an arbitrarily long time .",
    "for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors suspend janus particles with a golden cap in a water - lutidine mixture .",

    "catalyzes a chemical reaction of the fuel towards a chemical product ( shown as green dots ) , which diffuses around . in steady state a non - uniform concentration profile around the particle",
    "is established @xcite . since the janus colloid produces the diffusing chemical by itself , the propulsion mechanism is called self - diffusiophoresis .",
    "recent works showed how details of the surface coating and ionic effects determine the swimming speed and efficiency of catalytically driven active colloids @xcite .",
    "janus colloids coated with metals such as gold are able to move by heating the metal cap @xcite .",
    "the resulting local temperature gradient induces an effective slip velocity , which is known as _ soret effect _ , and the active colloid moves by self - thermophoresis .",

    ", one solves the homogeneous stokes equations for @xmath74 with the boundary condition @xmath75 , where @xmath0 is the constant swimming speed and @xmath76 is the angular velocity of the active colloid .",
    "since phoretic transport is force- and torque free @xcite , both the hydrodynamic force and torque of equations ( [ eq : fmstress1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fmstress2 ] ) should be zero when evaluated along the surface with radius @xmath77 .",
    "this gives the translational and angular velocity of a spherical ( self-)phoretic colloid @xcite , @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the average taken over the surface with normal @xmath16 .",
    "note that for axissymmetric surface velocity profiles , @xmath80 and the active colloid moves on a straight line .",
    "this is , for example , true for half - coated janus spheres .",
    "nevertheless , rotational brownian motion reorients the swimmer and it performs a persistent random walk , as we will discuss in section [ sec : walk ] .    to gain a better insight into self - phoretic motion on the microscopic level , explicit hydrodynamic mesoscale simulation techniques have been used to study self - diffusiophoretic and self - thermophoretic motion . in particular , reactive multi - particle colision dynamics ( r - mpcd )",
    "is a method to explicitely simulate the full hydrodynamic flow fields and chemical fields around a swimmer .",

    "the simulated flow field of a sphere - dimer swimmer agrees with that of a force dipole @xcite , which has recently been confirmed by an analytic calculation @xcite .",
    "dissipative particle dynamics was used to determine the effect of particle shape on active motion @xcite , and to calculate the flow fields initiated by self - propelled janus colloids for different fluid - colloid interactions @xcite . in active emulsion droplets spontaneous symmetry",
    "breaking generates gradients in the density of surfactant molecules at the droplet - fluid interface and thus gradients in surface tension @xmath81 .",
    "they drive _ marangoni flow _ at the interface @xcite .",
    "the slip velocity field does not simply follow from an equivalent of equation  ( [ eq : slipv ] ) , which links slip velocity to @xmath82 .",
    "instead , one has to solve the stokes equations inside and outside the droplets and match the difference in tangential viscous stresses by @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "so , in contrast to colloidal particles fluid flow also evolves inside the droplet @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the active motion of self - phoretic colloids is mainly determined by the surface velocity field @xmath59 independent of the underlying physical or chemical mechanisms to realize @xmath59 . in the simplest case",

    "this leads to a persistent random walk , which is described by an effective diffusion constant on sufficiently large length scales .",

    "note that the translational diffusion constant of a sphere is @xmath125 @xcite .    to quantify the importance of translational and rotational diffusion compared to the directed swimming motion",

    "to do so , we introduce the ballistic time scale @xmath128 , which the microswimmer needs to swim its own diameter @xmath129 , and the diffusive time scale @xmath130 , which it needs to diffuse its own size .",
    "the pclet number compares the two time scales , @xmath131 for @xmath132 the particle motion is mainly governed by translational diffusion , such as for passive brownian particles , while for @xmath133 diffusive transport is negligible compared to active motion .",
    "the persistence number compares the persistence time @xmath121 to the ballistic time scale @xmath134 , @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the _ persistence length _ ,",

    "[ fig : msd ] a typical persistence length of the random walk of a spherical microswimmer in 2d is indicated .",
    "we now discuss the mean square displacement of the active particle , which defines an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath141 .",
