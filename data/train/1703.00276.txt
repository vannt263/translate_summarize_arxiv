    "stellar structure models with metallicities ( z ) from half to double solar ( where solar is 0.014@xmath15 were selected from the large set presented by karakas@xmath16 computed with the monash - stromlo code@xmath17 .",
    "no mass - loss was assumed on the red giant branch and the vassiliadis & wood@xmath18 mass - loss formulation was used on the agb .",
    "the c - rich and n - rich low - temperature opacity tables were taken from marigo & aringer@xmath19 .",
    "convection was approximated using the mixing length theory with a mixing - length parameter of 1.86 in all calculations .",
    "no convective overshoot was applied , although the algorithm described by lattanzio@xmath20 was used to search for a neutrally stable point for the border between convective and radiative zones .    from the models presented by karakas@xmath16 , in the supplementary table  1",
    "we present a selection with initial masses from 4.5 to 8 @xmath4  with canonical values of the he content .",
    "more details on the physical quantities of the models can be found in table  1 of karakas@xmath16 . in supplementary table  1",
    "we only report a summary of those that are most relevant here : the total number of thermal instabilities of the he - burning shell ( thermal pulses , tps ) ; the maximum temperature at the base of the convective envelope ( @xmath21 ) ; the maximum temperature achieved in the inter - shell ( @xmath22 ) ; and the mass lost during the whole evolution ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "all the models experienced @xmath21 high enough to activate hbb , except for the 5 @xmath4 model of z@xmath24 .",
    "it should be noted that the mass and metallicity ranges at which hbb occurs are model dependent : for the same mass and metallicity , models using more or less efficient convection , for example , via a different mixing length parameter or different mixing schemes , result in different temperatures@xcite .",
    "all our stellar models also experienced efficient third dredge - up , i.e. , c - rich material being carried from the he - rich inter - shell to the convective envelope .",
    "this is also model dependent .",
    "overshooting at the base of the convective region associated with the tps is not included in our models . in combination with the third dredge - up it would enrich the envelope in o. however , this would not change the oxygen isotopic ratios at the stellar surface since hbb efficiently brings them to their equilibrium values , similarly to the case of the carbon isotopic ratios . in the lower - mass stars where",
    "hbb is not activated , efficient third dredge - up of o would be accompanied by efficient third dredge - up of c , producing a c - rich envelope where the oxide and silicate grains considered here do not form .",
    "because of both the large dilution and the effect of hbb , most of the models lead to o - rich surfaces  the condition for the formation of oxide and silicate grains of interest here  during their whole evolution , except for the 4.5 @xmath4 model of z=0.014 and the 5 @xmath4 model of z=0.007 .",
    "these latter become c - rich after the second last tp and the last tp , respectively , which results in 4050% of the material ejected to be c - rich .",
    "for all the models , a relatively large fraction of the envelope material ( 2030% ) is still present when our calculations stopped converging .",
    "the abundances we calculated for the last model are either lower limits or a good approximation to the final enrichment , depending on possible further occurrence of third dredge - ups episodes beyond the point where our models stop converging .",
    "we fed the computed stellar structure into the monash post - processing code to calculate the detailed nucleosynthesis by solving simultaneously the abundance changes wrought by nuclear reactions and by convection using a `` donor cell '' advective scheme with two - streams ( up and down ) mixing .",
    "the simultaneous treatment of mixing and burning is required to model hbb in detail because nuclear reactions occur that may have timescales similar or shorter than the mixing timescales , also as function of the location in the envelope . in these cases",
    "it is not possible to make the assumption of istantaneous mixing at an average burning rate .",
    "essentially our method couples mixing and burning together in the post processing to obtain the nucleosynthesis , while the energetic feedback of hbb is taken from the structure calculations performed using instantaneous mixing .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of elements up to pb and bi from the complete set of the models of karakas@xmath16 with he canonical abundance can be found in karakas & lugaro@xcite , together with a full discussion of the results .",
    "briefly , in models that experience hbb , @xmath21 is the main feature controlling the composition of the stellar surface , and specifically the oxygen and aluminium ratios that are measured in oxide and silicate stardust grains . in massive agb stars of metallicity around solar",
    "the mg composition is affected mainly by the activation of the ne(@xmath9,n)mg and ne(@xmath9,@xmath6)mg reactions in the he - rich inter - shell  where @xmath22 is well above the activation temperature ( t @xmath25  mk ) of these reactions in all the models  and the subsequent third dredge - up of this material to the stellar surface . with respect to karakas & lugaro@xcite , we updated the ne+@xmath9 reaction rates from iliadis _",
    "et al._@xcite to longland _",
    "et al._@xmath26 and the mg+@xmath6 reaction rates from iliadis _ et al._@xcite to straniero _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "also , in the present study , we limited our calculations to a small network of 77 nuclear species , from neutrons to sulfur , plus the elements around the fe peak , as described , e.g. , in karakas@xmath17 .",
    "this choice allowed us to run each model in a few hours and test different values of the o(p,@xmath9)n reaction rate : the recommended , the upper limit , and the lower limit from both iliadis _ et al._@xcite and luna@xcite . for the o(p,@xmath6)f rate we used the value recommended by iliadis",
    "_ et al._@xcite , which has an uncertainty of 7%@xcite .",
    "for the initial composition , we used asplund _",
    "et al._@xmath15 for the solar metallicity models , scaled down or up by factor of two for the z=0.007 and z=0.03 models , respectively . while we calculated detailed model predictions for all the models listed in the supplementary table  1 , in the figures and discussion we focus on the 4.5 , 5 , and 6 @xmath4 models with z=0.014 only , for sake of clarity .",
    "models with different metallicities in the same mass range have similar @xmath21 and provide similar results , except for the 5 @xmath4model of z=0.03 , which does not experience hbb but remains o - rich due to the low efficiency of the third dredge - up combined with the high initial o abundance . on the other hand , the 8 @xmath4 models have too high @xmath21 to provide a match with the grain data ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "stellar population synthesis models are needed to assess whether a number of group i grains may also have originated from super - solar metallicity o - rich massive agb stars that do not experience hbb ."

    "<S> here we focus on oxide and silicate grains , which are classified into different groups mostly based on their oxygen isotopic compositions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> group i grains make up the majority ( @xmath375% ) of oxide and silicate grains and show excesses in o characteristic of the first dredge - up in red giant stars of initial mass roughly 13 @xmath4 , with a maximum o / o@xmath30.003 . </S>",

    "<S> hydrogen burning affects the surface composition of massive ( @xmath1 4 @xmath4 ) agb stars when the base of the convective envelope becomes hot enough for proton - capture nucleosynthesis to occur@xcite ( `` hot bottom burning '' , hbb , figure  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are the brightest agb stars , and the fact that they mostly show c / o@xmath21 is attributed to the operation of the cn cycle , which depletes carbon@xcite , in contrast to their less bright counterparts , which mostly show c / o@xmath11 as a result of the dredge - up of he - burning material rich in carbon . </S>",
    "<S> characteristic temperatures of hbb exceed @xmath360  mk and , thanks to the fast convective turn - over time ( @xmath7  yr ) , the composition of the whole envelope is quickly transmuted into the h - burning equilibrium abundances produced at the base of the envelope . </S>",
    "<S> massive agb stars are observed to generate significant amounts of dust and based on current models of galactic dust evolution are expected to have contributed almost half of the o - rich dust of agb origin in the solar system@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , no stardust grains have been found to show the signature of hbb because , although group ii grains show the highly depleted o / o ratios qualitatively expected from hbb , their o / o ratios are roughly two - times lower than predicted@xcite using the available reaction rates@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> currently , the preferred suggestion for the origin of group ii grains is that they formed in agb stars of low mass ( @xmath21.5 @xmath4 ) that did not dredge - up enough carbon to become c - rich but experienced extra mixing below the bottom of the convective envelope ( `` cool bottom processing '' , cbp@xcite , figure 1 ) . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> material from the bottom of the convective envelope penetrates the thin radiative region located between the base of the convective envelope and the top of the h - burning shell where the temperature and density increase steeply with mass depth and proton captures can occur ( figure  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> while mechanisms have been proposed to explain the physical process driving this extra mixing@xcite the current modelling of the cbp is parametric : both the rate of the extra mixing and the depth reached are treated as a free parameters , with the depth adjusted in order to reach temperatures in the range 4055 mk .    </S>",
    "<S> whichever scenario we consider , the equilibrium o / o ratio produced by h burning is determined by the competition between the processes that produce and destroy o. specifically , it depends on the ratio between the rate of the o(p,@xmath6)f reaction , which produces o following the beta decay of f ( t@xmath8  s ) , and the rate of the o(p,@xmath9)n reaction , which destroys o. ( note that the o(p,@xmath6)f is comparatively negligible at all temperatures considered here ) . </S>",
    "<S> the former is known to within 7%@xcite ; the latter has recently been determined@xcite from a direct measurement of the strength of the 64.5  kev resonance that dominates the o(p,@xmath9)n reaction rate at temperatures between 10 and 100 mk@xcite , i.e. , over the entire range of interest here . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment took place at the laboratory for underground nuclear astrophysics ( luna ) at gran sasso , italy , where improved experimental procedures and a 15-times lower background for @xmath9 particles detection than in surface laboratories allowed for the most sensitive measurement to date@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the new rate is 22.5 times higher than previous evaluations@xcite . at the temperatures of 4055 </S>",
    "<S> mk typical of cbp the new rate reproduces only the lowest o / o values observed in group ii grains ( figure  2 ) . at the temperatures of 6080 mk typical of hbb , instead , the new rate reproduces most of the observed o / o range , revealing for the first time the signature expected from hbb in stardust grains . </S>",
    "<S> hbb temperatures higher than @xmath3 80 mk are excluded for the parent stars of the grains .    although the initial stellar mass and metallicity ranges at which hbb occurs as well as the agb lifetime are model dependent@xcite , our result is robust because any massive agb model experiencing hbb with temperatures between 60 and 80 mk will necessarily produce o / o ratios in agreement with those observed in most group ii grains . </S>",
    "<S> figure  3 shows the surface evolution of the oxygen isotopic ratios for three agb models ( of initial mass 4.5 , 5 , and 6 @xmath4 ) of solar metallicity that experience hbb ( see methods section ) , compared to observed isotopic ratios in group ii stardust grains . </S>",
    "<S> the models evolve through the first and second dredge - ups at the end of core h- and he - burning , respectively , which increase the o / o ratio by roughly a factor of five . during the subsequent agb phase , hbb quickly ( e.g. , after about 1/5 of its total tp - agb lifetime for a 6@xmath4  star ) shifts the oxygen isotopic composition to the equilibrium values corresponding to the burning temperature . using the luna rate , the o / </S>",
    "<S> o ratio produced by hbb is roughly a factor of 2 lower than that obtained with the previous rate by iliadis _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite and nicely reproduces those observed in group ii grains , when agb material is diluted with material of solar composition . </S>",
    "<S> the dilution is required because hbb strongly depletes o. this is in accordance with the non - detection of o in bright o - rich agb stars@xcite , but results in o / o ratios more than two orders of magnitude lower than observed in group ii grains . </S>",
    "<S> dilution with solar material is particularly effective in increasing the o / o ratio : for example , 99% of hbb material mixed with only 1% of solar material increases the o / o by two orders of magnitudes . on the other hand , dilution has a comparatively minor effect on the other isotopes measured in the grains because o , mg , and al are _ produced _ rather than _ destroyed _ in massive agb stars . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it takes dilution with 50% of solar system material to decrease the o / o and mg / mg ratios by a factor of 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> dilution can be wrought by percent - level traces of contaminant oxygen ( e.g. , from terrestrial or non - presolar material ) during isotopic measurements , which can result in o / o up to @xmath310@xmath10 ; however , laboratory contamination can not easily explain grains with higher o / o values . </S>",
    "<S> for these , a dilution of the hbb signature composition with solar system material at the level of a few tens of percent is required . </S>",
    "<S> even higher dilution would result in a fraction of group i grains also originating from massive agb stars . </S>",
    "<S> possible processes may involve dilution with previously ejected gas within the dust formation region ; dilution with material in the interstellar medium ; and/or a significantly lower value of the o(p,@xmath9)n reaction rate . </S>",
    "<S> a study of this reaction has recently been completed at luna and data analysis is in progress .    </S>",
    "<S> the other isotopic pairs measured in group ii grains are also consistent with an origin in massive agb stars . </S>",
    "<S> the mg / mg ratios are enhanced in massive agb stars by the third dredge - up of material from the he inter - shell , where the ne(@xmath9,n)mg reaction is activated , and such a signature is seen in some presolar spinel ( mgal@xmath11o@xmath12 ) grains ( figure  4a ) . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the two times solar mg / mg value observed in a spinel grain named 14 - 12 - 7@xcite is close to that obtained in the final composition of the 5 @xmath4 , model . </S>",
    "<S> however , grain oc2@xcite and the majority of the other grains show a spread in the mg / mg ratio from 1 to 1.5 times solar , i.e. , lower than predicted by the dilution computed using the final agb composition . </S>",
    "<S> this may reflect partial equilibration of mg isotopes in the grains themselves@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the lower mg / mg ratios may be explained by truncating the agb evolution to one - half or one - third of the total computed evolution ( as illustrated in figures  3 and 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this could result from a higher mass - loss rate and/or the effect of binary interactions . </S>",
    "<S> another solution allowed within current model uncertainties is a less efficient third dredge - up than calculated in our models . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the high al / al ratios up to @xmath30.1 typical of group ii grains are also consistent with hbb ( figure  4b ) , although an accurate analysis is currently hampered by the uncertainties in the mg and al proton - capture rates@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our evidence that some meteoritic stardust grains exist whose o , mg , and al isotopic composition is best accounted for by h - burning conditions characteristic of massive agb stars proves that these stars were dust contributors to the early solar system . </S>",
    "<S> it further provides us with a new tool to deepen our understanding of uncertain physical processes in massive agb stars , for which observational constraints are still scarce .    </S>",
