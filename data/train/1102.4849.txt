    "all these environments must be modelled .",
    "we describe this wide range of environments by considering four scenarios : the orbital path of the dwarf around the host galaxy , discussed in  [ ssec : orbit ] ; the heating and cooling of the gas present , discussed in  [ ssec : heating ] ; how tidal or ram pressure stripping removes gas from the dwarf in  [ ssec : rps ] ; and how this stripping can be influenced by stellar formation and feedback , detailed in ",
    "[ ssec : starform ] .",
    "all four , to varying degrees , will be influenced by how much gas the dwarf galaxy has at the beginning of its orbit and the properties of the dark matter halo that envelopes the dwarf .",
    "the profile of the dwarf galaxy dark - matter halo is not a simple choice , with no solid consensus on which profile most accurately describes the low - mass subhalos present in dwarf galaxies .",
    "observationally , the dark - matter profile of dwarfs can not be distinguished between a cuspy profile and that of a cored , constant - density profile @xcite .",
    "both of these profiles also arise through simulations with the cuspy einasto profile arising through large _",
    "n_-body , dark - matter only , simulations @xcite . with the addition of baryons",
    ", it has been argued that an even steeper central core  through the process of baryonic contraction  can be present than predicted by the dissipationless @xmath13-body simulations @xcite .",
    "however , by coupling the baryons with the dark matter , and allowing dynamical and angular momentum transfer to occur , constant density cores with burkert like profiles @xcite are able to develop in simulation @xcite .",
    "since our major focus is on dark matter - halos with low gas fraction , whereby both baryon  dark - matter coupling and baryonic contraction will have a smaller impact , we ignore these competing factors and use the einasto profile .",
    "the choice of profile for the host galaxy is less contentious , and is chosen to have an evolving einasto profile.although the host contains more baryons than the dwarf galaxies we are interested in , due to its much larger mass baryonic contraction processes have a lower net effect .",

    "the shaded region of low pericentre is halos that would be stripped due to their very close passages , but the no disk assumption begins to break down as well as the increased computational cost means these halos were not modelled .    in our model",
    "all dwarfs end at apogalacticon , however , the results are substantially the same if you begin them at apogalaction ( for low redshifts where the orbit does not change significantly over time ) , we hence assume for analysis that they are at a random point along their orbit , and that this orbit is elliptical , as opposed to the standard rosetta orbit an einasto profile will produce . under these assumptions ,",

    "halos with a circularity @xmath171 were assumed to contain gas , however , these halos have very eccentric orbits and hence will normally have a near zero weight .",
    "we then calculate what fraction of observed dwarf galaxies contain gas , looking at all galaxies below a given galactocentric radius in @xmath120  kpc bins out to @xmath172  kpc and compare this to the fraction of galaxies  with confirmed detections and excluding the smc and lmc discussed below  that contain gas from gp09 .",
    "we use three cutoffs to distinguish between gas - deficient and gas - rich dwarfs .",
    "a lower cutoff of @xmath173  m@xmath119 is above the upper - boundary of a number of gp09 galaxies a mid - range cut - off of @xmath174  m@xmath119 is above the upper - boundary of even more galaxies in the gp09 sample .",
    "finally an upper cut - off of @xmath175  m@xmath119 , this cut - off is below the mass of any confirmed gas - rich galaxy in the gp09 sample .",
    "these cut offs do not accurately represent the physical constraints on observations , with the observed being a combination of low cut - offs for nearby galactic satellites to higher - cutoffs for far - off or m31 satellites .    under our model ,",
    "the lmc and smc being much more massive than the typical dwarf@xmath176  m@xmath119 @xcite , @xmath177  m@xmath119 @xcite  will be able to retain significant quantities of warm gas against ram - pressure stripping .",
    "this protection from stripping would allow a significant quantity of gas to survive until the present day , with only tidal interactions  potentially those between the lmc and smc  removing material from either dwarf galaxy .",
    "although tidal stripping is included in our model , it is too simplistic to model the multi - body system present in the magellanic clouds , with hydrodynamical simulations required to simulate the lmc - smc - galaxy system @xcite .    for models beginning at @xmath122 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : z1results ] ) we see a large over estimation for all gas cut - off masses . for models beginning at @xmath123 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : z3results ] ) again the predicted fraction exceeds the observed fraction of dwarfs , but predicts a lower fraction than models beginning at @xmath122 .",
    "discovery of new gas - rich dwarfs far from the galaxy may raise the observed fraction , but this may not explain the over - abundance predicted close in , where gas - rich dwarfs would be more detectable than further gas - deficient dwarfs due to more ongoing star formation .     versus radius for dwarf galaxies that began at @xmath122 .",
    "we note that the low radius spike in the @xcite data ( gp09 data ) occurs due to a single galaxy ",

    "[ fig : z10results ] ) , the @xmath179  m@xmath119 and @xmath180  m@xmath119 cut - offs again overestimates the fraction of halos which will contain gas .",
    "the @xmath181  m@xmath119 cut - off closely follows the shape of the gp09 sample , and is always below this fraction . at any distance",
    "we would expect the @xcite fraction to be slightly higher than reality , as the gas poor dwarfs being difficult to see may not be fully accounted for . that the toy model represents the gas fraction best for halos beginning at @xmath125 adds support to the idea that the milky way dwarfs were formed at or before this redshift @xcite .     versus radius for dwarf galaxies that began at @xmath125 .",
    "again the fraction of close - in dwarfs with gas observed exceeds that of the model ( see fig .  [",

    "this simple toy model reproduces the observed fraction of gas - rich dwarfs , however , there are several factors that were assumed to be negligible which could affect the amount of gas that survives .",
    "the accretion of gas onto dwarfs is unaccounted for in this model .",
    "the prospect of low redshift accretion @xcite in particular would greatly increase the chance of a dwarf surviving with gas to the present day , and if included for all dwarfs would likely result in an overestimation of the gas fraction even for dwarfs beginning at late redshifts .",
    "the effects of dust through photoelectric heating and cooling is also ignored . due to the low metallicity environments that dwarf galaxies typically have",
    ", this effect will be smaller than in larger galaxies , but may still be an important source of heating or cooling .",
    "we also assume that the early extragalactic uv field is uniform in space , a clumpy radiation field around the time of reionization , may have a large impact on the amount of gas that remains cold and protected from ram pressure stripping , this early gas loss could greatly impact the survival around the earliest pericentre passages .",
    "the use of a smooth medium for the gas  compared to a more realistic fractal medium  minimises the cooling of warm gas and allows it to extend beyond the tidal radius .",
    "even with a large filling factor , the gas will cool much more quickly via metal line cooling than in the smooth medium minimising the large gas loss at the beginning .",
    "potentially the biggest limitation is the assumption that all of the supernova energy goes into heating the gas to an extremely hot state , much of this energy likely goes into raising cold and warm gas out of the potential well of the dwarf , allowing it to be much more easily stripped . in particular",
    "this will predominantly impact the lowest gas masses , where the smooth gas assumption versus a fractal medium is more likely to have a large impact @xcite .    due to the large initial gas loss , our star formation rates do not represent that of the majority of dwarfs , with most stars forming early in the dwarfs life , as opposed to a roughly continuous star formation rate with some bursts @xcite .",
    "this makes our model more suited to explaining dwarfs with these early periods of star formation where a majority of stars are formed , e.g. bk5n , kdg52 @xcite .    even with these limitations",
    ", we believe that the toy model provides strong support towards internal heating due to early star formation , allowing the gas to more easily stripped due to the larger scale heights and lower density of warm and hot gas .",
    "in particular we were able to reproduce the fraction of dwarf galaxies that retain assuming that the dwarf galaxies infall at a redshift of @xmath125 consistent with @xcite .",
    "the covering fraction of warm gas stripped from the dwarfs is expected to be low , with the contrails containing approximately the same amount of warm gas as exists inside the cold streams that cover @xmath184 of the projected area of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this gas breaking away in small clumps of warm material will form a warm component of the hot halo which is stabilised against heat conduction from the halo by cooling @xcite before falling onto the galaxy as a warm rain .",
    "even with the majority of dwarf galaxies entering at early redshifts , the large timescale required to complete large pericentre orbits ( @xmath185  gyr for @xmath186  kpc ) means that gas from any late infalling dwarfs  such as those from @xmath123 or @xmath122will only be falling onto the disk of the galaxy today .",
    "a search for this gas in h@xmath26 around local galaxies is now being undertaken using the maryland - magellan tunable filter @xcite and the grantecan osiris tunable filter @xcite where the expected emission measure of the gas ( @xmath187  @xmath188  pc ) may be just large enough to be detectable .",
