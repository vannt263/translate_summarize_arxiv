    "renormalizability - especially asymptotic freedom- is a deep and fundamental property of four - dimensional non - abelian gauge theories@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , at the moment we understand these theories well only in perturbation theory .",
    "although qualitative connections with ads theories of gravity have been made@xcite , a precise quantitative solution for the spectrum of a non - abelian gauge theory remains out of our grasp .",
    "if we could get a non - perturbative formulation of the theory , free of divergences , we would be closer to the goal of proving that there is a mass gap and string tension@xcite .    the kondo problem @xcite provides us with a simpler , but quite deep , example of renormalization - and asymptotic freedom- with its own intrinsic physical interest . in a sense",
    ", it is the `` hydrogen atom '' of renormalization theory . it should be possible to solve this basic problem by simple methods , without unwieldy numerical calculations or clever ansatzes that depend on too many details of the particular model .",
    "once we understand how to do this , we can see how similar ideas might apply to gauge theories and their dual gravities .",
    "electrons in a metal move more or less like free particles , occasionally scattered by the ions which oscillate around their equilibrium positions by thermal fluctuations .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the ions move less and the resistance should decrease .",
    "it does , except that at some low temperature ( @xmath1 ) the resistance starts to increase again , rising to a finite value as @xmath2 kondo s explanation was that metals can have magnetic impurities ( e.g. , iron atoms embedded within a copper lattice ) whose magnetic moments become ordered at low temperatures .",
    "these little magnets can scatter electrons too , an additional contribution to resistance at low temperature.the size of an atomic impurity is very small compared to the wavelength of the electron : it is much like a @xmath3 function interaction .",
    "this causes divergences : kondo calculated the magnetic contribution to resistance to be proportional to @xmath4 * * thus kondo explained why resistance grows at low temperatures.theflaw is that it predicts infinite resistance at zero temperature , contradicting experimental observations .",
    "this is the kondo problem .",
    "wilson s landmark solution@xcite follows a numerical approach ( the numerical renormalization group ) .",
    "the essential complication is that there are an infinite number of electrons , all of whom contribute to the divergent part of the interaction .",
    "the ingenious methods wilson devised have not been generalized to the case of multiple impurities .",
    "also , they have not yet been made mathematically rigorous .",
    "andrei and wiegmann solved @xcite the kondo problem using bethe ansatz methods.while very elegant mathematically ( and potentially rigorous ) , the method is not flexible enough to be useful beyond the basic example of the single impurity and with a linear dispersion relation : in essence it is a fiendishly clever guess that happens to work because of the special symmetries of the problem .",
    "nozieres@xcite introduced a simple physical picture that is quite appealing : the magnetic impurity forms a bound state with an electron ( or hole ) and then mostly decouple from the rest of the electrons , leading to a fermi liquid .",
    "it would be great to recover this from the more fundamental kondo hamiltonian : somewhat analogous to recovering the chiral model from qcd .",
    "affleck and ludwig @xcitecome closest to recovering such a picture based on conformal field theory : representations of virasoro and kac - moody lie algebras .",
    "the motivation of our current work is in part to extend their studies beyond the critical point , to situations where conformal symmetry may not be exact .",
    "we work with a larger lie algebra than kac - moody or virasoro , spanned by all the spin - singlet bilinears of the electrons : even those that are not local field operators .",
    "we will see that these observables have small fluctuations in the limit where the spins take a large number of values @xmath0 : the bilinears have commutators of order@xmath5 thus , even as @xmath6 is kept fixed ( for example , set equal to one ) the commutators can be approximated by classical poisson brackets .",
    "this `` neo - classical '' limit@xcite retains many of the essential features of the theory , like the logarithmic divergence of the coupling constant",
    ". we will be able to perform renormalizaton explicitly and obtain the ground state in this limit .",
    "we then quantize the excitations around this ground state , thus recovering the finite @xmath0 theory .",
    "this strategy was applied earlier to two dimensional qcd@xcite , ( which is free of uv divergences ) as well as the chiral gross - neveu model@xcite(also called the non - abelian thirring model ) .",
    "the kondo problem is in fact simpler than either of these cases .",
    "nevertheless , we believe it is instructive to work it out explicitly .",
    "the large @xmath0 limit of the kondo problem has been studied before@xcite .",
    "but the usual diagrammatic approaches are not the best way to understand how a new non - perturbative ground state forms .",
    "our methods are more similar to the variational principles of bcs theory : but they allow for a systematic expansion around the neo - classical answer .    while there remain technical and mathematical details to be explained , we recover a simple picture : an impurity - electron condensate forms , and the excitations around this ground state are electron - like quasi - particles , but with a modified spectrum of energies .",
    "there has been a revival of interest in the kondo effect because it occurs in quantum dots .",
    "since the parameters can be tuned@xcite , this experimental realization holds promise of testing the theory as well as the potential for the invention of new devices based on the kondo effect .",

    "capital letters @xmath14 will denote indices that can take either conduction band or impurity values : @xmath15 or @xmath16 the momenta take a finite range of values @xmath17 .",
    "the interesting physical region is when the energies are small compared to @xmath18or equivalently , @xmath19 but",
    "this limit is very subtle , requiring a renormalization of a coupling constant . our strategy will be to understand this first in the case of large @xmath20 and only then pass to the case of finite @xmath21    define the spin - zero bilinears @xmath22    it is straightforward to check the commutation relations ( the idea that fermion bilinears span a unitary lie algebra go back to schwinger in the early days of quantum field theory . )",

    "they will tend to classical observables , the commutators being replaced by poisson brackets .",
    "we can think of the finite @xmath0 case as the quantization of these poisson brackets , with @xmath24 playing the role of @xmath6 in the usual quantum theory .",
    "this approach to the large @xmath0 limit is motivated by the theory of solitons in the theory of strong interactions . in the large @xmath0 limit , the heisenberg equations of motion for the bilinears will tend to hamiltonian equations . such unusual classical limits ( where a classical theory emerges even as @xmath6 is finite , but some other parameter goes to zero )",
    "have been called ` neo - classical ' in another context .",
    "we will solve for the static solution of least energy .",
    "for the solution to remain well - defined as @xmath25 we will have to renormalize a coupling constant even in this neo - classical limit .",

    "the kondo hamiltonian is    @xmath27    the sum over all momentum of the conduction band electrons amounts to evaluating the operators at the position of the impurity ( the origin ) .    we have allowed the spin generators to form a @xmath28 lie algebra rather than @xmath29 this is a minor change , as the added singlet decouples from the rest .",
    "but it makes for easier book keeping.(in t hooft s study of the large @xmath0 limit of gauge theories , a similar passage from @xmath30 to @xmath28 gauge group is made . )    of interest is anti - ferromagnetic case @xmath31 , where the electron and the impurity will form a spin - singlet .",

    "note that we do not allow @xmath35or @xmath10 to take the value @xmath40 this is to avoid an annoying zero mode and is not an essential restriction .",
