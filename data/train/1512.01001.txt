    "the concept of the electron mass dressing by a laser field is almost as old as the laser itself .",
    "it was v.  i.  ritus , a.  i.  nikishov and their collaborators ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) who thoroughly investigated the importance of this concept by considering fundamental processes of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , modified or induced by an action of intense electromagnetic plane wave ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the prominent example of such a process is the compton scattering in which an electron , interacting with a laser field , emits a nonlaser photon .",
    "its classical analogue is the so - called thomson scattering in which an electron , accelerated or decelerated while interacting with a laser field , emits an electromagnetic radiation .",
    "if an electron interacts with a monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave of the frequency @xmath0 and of the time - averaged intensity @xmath1 , the energy spectrum of compton photons is defined by the so - called klein - nishina formula  @xcite , @xmath2 with positive integers @xmath3 . in this formula",
    ", the symbol @xmath4 means the relativistic scalar product of four - vectors , @xmath5 , with the four - vector @xmath6 and similarly for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the three - dimensional scalar product . here",
    ", it is assumed that the plane wave propagates in the space direction @xmath9 , meaning that @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , the compton photon is generated in the direction @xmath12 [ @xmath13 and @xmath14 with the four - momentum @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the electron initial momentum on the free - electron mass shell , @xmath17 .",
    "the so - called ponderomotive energy of electrons in the laser field equals @xmath18 here , @xmath19 where the electric field amplitude of the plane wave , @xmath20 , is related to the time - averaged intensity of the laser field such that ( @xmath21 means the vacuum permittivity ) @xmath22 moreover , @xmath23 defines the maximum value of @xmath24 ( i.e. , @xmath25 when @xmath26 ) , and it represents the only parameter that contains the planck constant @xmath27 .",
    "note that , in the limit @xmath28 , we recover the classical thomson formula for frequencies of generated radiation , @xmath29 which are not limited from above as , in the classical limit , @xmath30 .",
    "hence , one can find the scaling law , @xmath31 which relates the compton and thomson frequencies .",
    "the consequences of this scaling law for the plane waves and long laser pulses have been studied in  @xcite , whereas its extension to arbitrary short laser pulses with the discussion of the electron spin and laser pulse polarization effects has been investigated in @xcite . in our further analysis",
    "we use units in which @xmath32 .",
    "it follows from the klein - nishina formula   that , for a given kinematics of the compton scattering , the measurement of positions of two consecutive peaks in the compton spectrum , @xmath24 and @xmath33 , allows one to determine the ponderomotive energy @xmath34 . indeed , after some algebra , we arrive at the expression , @xmath35 note that the right - hand - side of this expression has to be independent of @xmath3 .",
    "this means that the proposed procedure of measuring @xmath34 does not require the knowledge of the order of the compton frequency , @xmath3 , but only positions of arbitrary chosen two adjacent peaks . in general , one could select peaks in the spectrum corresponding to frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and arrive at the similar conclusion .    in order to relate the ponderomotive energy @xmath34 to the electron mass dressing let us recall that the volkov solution of the dirac equation @xcite for an electron with the four - momentum @xmath38 , @xmath39 , is @xmath40 u^{(+)}_{\\bm{p}\\lambda}\\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}s^{(+)}_p(x ) } , \\label{comp6}\\ ] ] where @xmath41\\mathrm{d}\\phi , \\label{comp7}\\ ] ] @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the free - electron bispinor normalized such that @xmath44 , with @xmath45 labeling its spin degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , for the linearly polarized plane wave , the vector potential has the form , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the polarization four - vector such that @xmath48 and @xmath49 . note also that @xmath50 , with the unit vector @xmath9 defined above .",
    "hence , the function @xmath51 can be splitted into two parts @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a periodic function of @xmath54 with the period of @xmath55 , whereas @xmath56 is the so - called electron dressed momentum by the laser field .",
    "one can easily verify that @xmath57 this means that the electron momentum in the laser field is on the mass shell with the dressed mass @xmath58 . by determining the ponderomotive energy @xmath34 and , hence , the parameter @xmath59 [ see , eq .  ] ,",
    "the electron dressed mass [ eq .  ] can be directly determined from the compton spectrum .",
    "the procedure described above allows one to determine the electron mass dressing in the presence of a monochromatic plane wave or , after some modifications , in the presence of polychromatic plane waves with commensurate frequencies . in real experiments , however , one deals with finite - in - time and focused - in - space laser pulses .",
    "the requirement of space focusing can be soften by considering the head - on collision of the laser pulse with relativistic electrons . under such conditions , in the electron reference frame ,",
    "the laser focus is largely oblate .",
    "thus , the laser pulse can be modeled as a plane - wave - fronted pulse which is finite in its propagation direction but it is infinite in the perpendicular directions  @xcite . for such laser pulses the following questions arise :    * is it still meaningful to consider the electron mass dressing by an arbitrary short laser pulse ? *",
    "if yes , can we measure the electron dressed mass for an arbitrary chosen laser pulse ?    our purpose is to answer these two questions .",
    "assume that the laser pulse lasts from @xmath60 up to @xmath61 and vanishes beyond this time interval .",
    "note that its time duration defines the fundamental frequency , @xmath62 , which is the smallest frequency in the spectral decomposition of the pulse . if @xmath63 , then the electromagnetic vector potential has the form , @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , @xmath66 for @xmath67 denote two linear polarizations of the laser field such that @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the two functions @xmath70 , @xmath67 , which we call the shape functions , are arbitrary and sufficiently smooth functions that vanish for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "this time , however , the electron dressed momentum becomes @xmath74 is it the most general form of the momentum dressing ?",
    "the answer to this question depends on the qed process under considerations .",
    "as it follows from the analysis presented in  @xcite , for the compton scattering , the scattering amplitude depends only on the difference between the final and initial dressed momenta , @xmath75 .",
    "this means that the physical observables do not change if we redefine the laser field dressing such that @xmath76 where @xmath77 is an arbitrary four - vector .",

    "it appears that the shifted dressed momentum   is on the mass - shell ( i.e. , @xmath81 is independent of @xmath82 ) for a particular choice of @xmath83 such that @xmath84 in this case , @xmath85 , \\label{volk9}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 can be called the electron dressed mass in the laser pulse , whereas @xmath86 .",

    "the point being that , for such pulses , the conventional diagnostic methods developed for moderately intense fields are not applicable .",
    "therefore , one may determine the peak intensity of the laser pulse by studying the properties of radiation generated in either the laser - modified recombination process  @xcite or in the thomson scattering  @xcite .",
    "it seems that this goal can be realized even more effectively by analyzing the ionization spectrum of photoelectrons  @xcite ( see , also ref .",
    "another possibility is to exploit the chirp of the laser pulse in the thomson or compton scattering @xcite .",
    "moreover , the problem of the relative change of the electron mass dressing by two laser pulses of different shapes has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the latter , however , does not provide a method for a direct measurement of the electron dressed mass .",
    "the aim of the next sections is to discuss how the electron dressed mass can be determined directly ( and , from the theoretical point of view , very precisely even for extremely short one - cycle laser pulses ) from the spectrum of radiation generated during the compton scattering .",
    "it is known that the coherent properties of radiation , which manifest themselves in interference and diffraction experiments , can lead to very precise measurements of physical quantities .",
    "this approach was initiated by t. young and his famous double - slit experiment  @xcite , which then triggered the development of other experimental techniques ( like diffraction gratings ) . among them , the frequency comb generation is of a particular interest .",
    "generation of optical frequency combs  @xcite has become an invaluable experimental tool for precise measurements of optical frequencies , that also enabled the creation of optical atomic clocks  @xcite .",
    "a particular realization of this technique , called the high - order harmonic generation  @xcite , has led to the development of attoscience  @xcite .",
    "this newly growing field is related to the interaction of matter with attosecond pulses of coherent radiation .",
    "also , it has been proposed that the interaction of modulated laser pulses with relativistic and nearly monoenergetic electron beams can create x- and @xmath90-ray frequency combs in the kev or mev region  @xcite .",
    "this may extend the applicability of frequency comb generation to nuclear and elementary particle physics .",
    "the same phenomenon was studied for matter and anti - matter waves  @xcite .",

    "moreover , @xmath96 labels the polarization of the compton photon , and @xmath97 and @xmath98 define the spin degrees of freedom of the initial and final electron states , respectively .",
    "the coherent enhancement of the compton amplitude @xmath91 is observed for such frequencies of emitted photons @xmath24 ( with integer @xmath3 ) , that satisfy the condition @xmath99 provided that @xmath100 . here , the light - cone variable @xmath101 ( and similarly for the remaining four - momenta of electron and photon ) has been used .",
    "it follows from eq .   that the probability distribution of compton scattering ( @xmath102 ) is enhanced by a factor of @xmath103 .",
    "meaning that the energy spectrum of radiated photons consists of a sequence of well separated peaks , which is in contrast to the compton process induced by a single pulse ( for which @xmath104 ) .",
    "note also that , in contrast to the thomson scattering , these peaks are not _ exactly _ equally separated from each other over the whole interval of allowed frequencies @xmath105 .",
    "when @xmath106 approaches the cut - off value , the distribution of @xmath24 becomes increasingly denser .",
    "thus , one can get the regular frequency combs out of the compton radiation only within limited frequency intervals .",
    "eq .   allows us to determine the peak frequencies in the energy spectrum of emitted compton photons . after algebraic manipulations , we arrive at the _ generalized klein - nishina formula _ ,",
    "@xmath107 which for the plane wave ( i.e. , when @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) reduces to the original one . here ,",

    "mark the positions of main peaks in the compton spectrum .",
    "similarly , one can find the location of secondary peaks ( if @xmath115 ) and zeros ( if @xmath116 ) in the angular - resolved frequency distributions .",
    "it is also worth noting that the polarization - dependent terms appear now in the definition of the directly measurable quantity ; in other words , they affect the positions of peak frequencies in the compton spectrum .",
    "next , we define the quantity @xmath117 which , according to , acquires integer values for peak frequencies @xmath118 .    .",
    "the laser pulse ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) propagates along the @xmath121 direction and it is polarized along the @xmath122 direction .",
    "these two axes define the scattering plane .",
    "the pulse has a @xmath123 envelope with @xmath108 and @xmath124 .",
    "the compton photon is emitted in the direction determined by the polar angle @xmath125 ( left column ) or @xmath126 ( right column ) and by the azimuthal angle @xmath127 , with the polarization vector parallel to the scattering plane . in the upper row ,",
    "the energy spectra of compton radiation are plotted as functions of the frequency @xmath106 whereas , in the lower row , as functions of @xmath128 .",
    "the vertical lines mark the integer values of the respective argument .",
    "[ c1],width=302 ]    the positions of the interference peaks allow us to determine parameters of the driving laser field . in order to demonstrate this",
    ", we introduce the quantities , @xmath129 they depend on the initial electron energy and the geometry of the process . except of @xmath130",
    ", they also depend on the frequency of emitted photons .",
    "the latter means that , for a given frequency distribution , @xmath130 remains constant .",
    "moreover , only @xmath130 depends on the laser pulse parameters such as @xmath131 and @xmath132 , @xmath67 ( note that only these parameters are necessary for determining the electron dressed mass ) . using the above definitions , eq .   can be rewritten as @xmath133 this equation determines @xmath130 provided that we can unambiguously prescribe an integer number @xmath128 to an arbitrary chosen peak . in general",
    ", this is impossible",
    ". therefore , we choose instead two arbitrary , consecutive peaks from the spectrum , i.e. , @xmath118 and @xmath134 . by solving the system of two equations   evaluated at @xmath118 and @xmath134",
    ", we obtain that @xmath135 this quantity is already independent of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , in order to determine three independent parameters @xmath136 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 present in the definition of @xmath130 , we should repeat this procedure for three different geometries .",
    "this finally leads to the system of three linear equations for the unknown @xmath136 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",

    "regardless of this interpretation , it is justified to apply the theory derived in ref .",

    "next , choosing for both cases two adjacent peaks from these spectra , we acquire from the numerical ( or experimental ) data the corresponding compton frequencies ( without knowing what the integer values of @xmath128 are prescribed to them ) . applying the method described in sec .",
    "[ method ] one can estimate now the laser pulse characteristics .",
    "namely , for the considered shape function  , they are very close to the exact values @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "note that , for larger @xmath93 , the peaks in the compton spectrum practically do not change their positions and they become sharper ( see , figs .",

    "we have shown that this concept seems to be not as fundamental as for the monochromatic plane wave ( in general , for the polychromatic plane waves with commensurate frequencies ) , as it does not follow directly from the floquet - bloch analysis of the volkov solution . however , with some modifications , it is possible to redefine the electron momentum dressing such that it is on the mass shell with the dressed mass , independent of the asymptotic electron momentum .",
    "if such a modification is accepted , then the analysis of the frequency combs in the compton scattering allows one to measure the dressed electron mass for arbitrarily short ( even one - cycle ) and intense laser pulses .",
    "this is achieved by determining characteristics of the laser pulse .",
    "from the practical point of view , the procedure described above provides a very precise method of diagnosis of extremely intense pulses in cases when the conventional methods fail .",
    "note also that this method is not only limited to the compton or thomson scattering , but can be extended to other quantum processes as well ( for instance , to the breit - wheeler process  @xcite or to ionization of atoms and molecules  @xcite ) ."
