    "a significant new area of interest in ultra - cold atomic gases is the study of systems in which the particles interact via a dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) @xcite .",
    "this interest is being driven by a broad range of proposed applications from condensed matter physics to quantum information , e.g.  see @xcite .",
    "experimental progress in the quantum degenerate regime has been driven by seminal work with @xmath0cr @xcite , which was bose condensed in 2005 , and more recently the realization of bose - einstein condensates of @xmath1dy @xcite and @xmath2er @xcite .",
    "polar molecules , which have ddis several orders of magnitude larger than those of the atomic gases , have already been produced in their ground rovibrational state @xcite , and steady progress is being made towards cooling these into the degenerate regime .",
    "we also note the recent achievement of a degenerate fermi gas of @xmath3dy @xcite .",
    "the ddi is long - ranged and anisotropic with both attractive and repulsive components .",
    "therefore , an important consideration is under what conditions the system is mechanically stable from collapse to a high density state .",
    "theoretical studies on zero temperature dipolar condensates reveal a rich stability diagram where , due to the ddi anisotropy , the stability is strongly dependent on the geometry of the trapping potential and the properties of the short ranged ( contact ) interactions @xcite .",
    "another interesting theoretical observation is that for appropriate parameters ( near instability ) the condensate mode exhibits spatial oscillations and has a density maximum away from the minimum of the trapping potential @xcite .",
    "however , evidence for this _ density oscillating _ state has yet to be observed in experiment .",
    "in this work we study the properties of a trapped dipolar bose gas at finite temperature  a regime largely unexplored in theory and experiments . in previous work @xcite we studied the stability of a normal bose gas ( i.e.  above @xmath4 ) using a self - consistent semiclassical approximation . in this work",
    "we extend this study to below @xmath4 and to include quantum pressure ( i.e.  beyond - semiclassical effects ) by numerically solving for the condensate and its excitations . using this theory we study the crossover from the high temperature ( above @xmath4 ) to zero temperature ( pure condensate ) stability .",
    "our results reveal that beyond semiclassical effects play a significant role above @xmath4 in oblate geometry traps and enhance the stability region , and that the double instability phase diagram in this trap geometry ( predicted in @xcite ) remains prominent .",
    "we also study the behavior of the emergent biconcave condensate ( density oscillating ground state ) in the finite temperature regime , and find that thermal effects enhance the density oscillation and enlarge the parameter regime over which this type of state exists .",
    "we demonstrate that the below @xmath4 temperature dependence of the stability boundary is well - characterized by a simple model that accounts for the thermal depletion of the condensate .",
    "here we consider a set of particles of mass @xmath5 confined in a cylindrically symmetric harmonic potential @xmath6,\\ ] ] of aspect ratio @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 representing the axial and radial directions , respectively .",
    "we take the particles to have dipole moments polarized along the @xmath8 axis by an external field , such that the ddi potential between particles is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the magnetic ( electric ) dipole - dipole interaction strength and @xmath12 is the angle between the @xmath8 direction and the relative separation of the dipoles ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is easy to extend our calculations to include local ( contact ) interactions , however here we focus on the case of pure dipole - dipole interactions , as has been realized in experiments by use of a feshbach resonance ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
    "the hartree formalism we employ ( see appendix [ sec : apphhf ] for a discussion of the relation to hartree - fock theory and relevant terms neglected ) involves solving for the system modes using the non - local equation @xmath14u_j({\\mathbf{x}}),\\label{hu}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 are the effective potential and total density , respectively , with @xmath16^{-1}$ ] the equilibrium ( bose - einstein ) occupation of the mode , @xmath17 the inverse temperature , and @xmath18 the chemical potential .",
    "equations  ( [ hu])-([nden ] ) are solved self - consistently while the chemical potential is adjusted to ensure that the desired total number @xmath19 is obtained .",
    "below the critical temperature @xmath4 a condensate forms in the lowest mode @xmath20 with @xmath21 , but the theory , as written in eqs .",
    "( [ hu])-([nden ] ) , requires no additional adjustment to account for the condensate ( due to our neglect of exchange ) and smoothly transitions across @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize that our motivation for using this theory is that it includes the dominant direct interactions and the full discrete character of the low energy modes , yet is more computationally efficient than bogoliubov - based approaches .",
    "this enables us to study challenging problems that have not been explored , in particular finite temperature mechanical stability , in which obtaining convergent self - consistent solutions is demanding and time consuming .",
    "our numerical approach builds on various developments ( particularly those described in @xcite ) and includes a number of features to aid calculations in the finite temperature regime where interaction effects dominate ( see appendix [ sec : appnum ] for details ) .",
    "the neglect of dipole exchange is consistent with other work on finite temperature bosons @xcite and zero temperature studies of fermion stability @xcite .",
    "we would like to note that there is some justification for this approximation .",
    "studies on a normal trapped dipolar fermi gas suggest that exchange interactions will quantitatively , but not qualitatively , affect stability @xcite . indeed , the thermodynamic study of that system presented in @xcite found that exchange interactions are typically less important than direct interactions except for traps that are close to being isotropic .",
    "similarly , ticknor studied the quasi - two - dimensional bose gas using the hartree - fock - bogoliubov - popov ( hfbp ) meanfield theory @xcite and found that exchange terms were generally less important than direct terms .",
    "to benchmark our hartree calculations we perform a quantitative comparison to the hfbp calculations that ronen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed for the three - dimensional trapped bose gas at finite temperature . in secs .  [ seccondfrac ] and [ secdenosc ] we make this comparison for two different sets of results from @xcite .",
    "we note that those hfbp calculations excluded _ thermal exchange _ interactions , although they did include _ condensate exchange _ interactions ( exchange interaction of condensate atoms on the thermal excitations ) . for definitions of these exchange terms . ]",
    "we extended our hartree algorithm to include condensate exchange but found it made negligible difference to the predictions and do not include results with this term here .",
    "the results of the first comparison we perform are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : hfbcompare](a ) .",
    "there we compare the condensate fraction , as a function of temperature , for a system with @xmath22 .",
    "we observe that the hartree and hfbp theories predict an appreciably lower condensate fraction than the ideal case , and are in very good agreement with each other over the full temperature range considered .",
    "the low energy excitations of a bose - einstein condensate are quasi - particles , which are accurately described by bogoliubov theory ( such as the hfbp theory ) , however the thermodynamic properties of the system are dominated by the single particle modes ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
    "a comparison of the bogoliubov and hartree - fock spectra of a @xmath23 dipolar bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) was made in @xcite .",

    "@xcite . in the purely dipolar case",
    "such biconcave states occur under certain conditions of trap and dipole parameters , but notably only for @xmath30 and for dipole strengths close to instability . in @xcite",
    "the hfbp technique was used to assess the effect of temperature on the density oscillating states .",
    "this was characterized by the contrast , a measure of the magnitude of the density oscillation , defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the density at trap center and @xmath33 is the maximum density of the system .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : hfbcompare](b ) we compare our hartree and hfbp theories for the contrast .",
    "this comparison reveals some small residual differences between the theories , however the results are in reasonable agreement and both predict that the contrast goes to zero ( i.e.  the condensate returns to having maximum density at trap center ) at @xmath34 .",

    "we locate the stability boundary ( i.e.  a curve ) that separates the stable and unstable regions .",
    "our procedure to obtain this boundary involves a computationally intensive search through parameter space to find the self - consistent solutions on the verge of instability . determining the stability boundary for fixed mean number @xmath54 complicates this process : since we work in the grand - canonical ensemble where the proper variables are @xmath56 , an additional iterative search over the parameter @xmath18 is required to fix @xmath54 to the desired target number .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpimun ] we provide some examples to illustrate how we identify the value of the ddi at the stability boundary for a gas with ( target number ) @xmath44 atoms at a particular temperature . to do this",

    "[ fig : dpimun](a ) the number at which collapse occurs is less than the target number , thus we conclude that the ddi used in this calculation lies within the unstable region for the system ( i.e.  no stable solution can be found for @xmath54 atoms with this value of ddi ) .",
    "in contrast , for case b in fig .  [",
    "fig : dpimun](a ) @xmath62 and thus the value of ddi is in the stable region . to locate the stability boundary points we need to trace out these curves for various @xmath63 values until we find @xmath64 to within our numerical tolerance ( this has to be done for each value of @xmath65 ) .",
    "this process is painstaking and can take several days to find a single point on the stability boundary .",
    "we identify the self - consistent hartree solutions as being unstable when they become grid - dependent .",
    "this means that as the distance between grid points tends to zero , the radial width of the cloud contracts and the chemical potential tends to negative infinity . precisely locating",

    "most prominently in the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] we observe that while the hartree and semiclassical stability boundaries are in good agreement for prolate geometries , in oblate traps the hartree results are significantly more stable .",

    "this observation is surprising because our calculation is for a rather large number of atoms ( @xmath44 ) , where the semiclassical approximation would normally be expected to furnish an accurate description of the above @xmath4 behavior .",

    "this arises from a confinement induced momentum dependence of the interaction : the interaction is repulsive ( stabilizing ) for low momentum interactions , but decays to being attractive with a characteristic wavevector @xmath78 set by the @xmath8 confinement length @xmath79 .",
    "notably these features of the confined interaction mediate bec instability through the softening of radially excited modes with a wavelength @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "it is not clear that these confinement effects will be applicable at a modestly oblate trap with @xmath81 , however numerical studies have revealed that quasi - particle modes with a wavelength @xmath80 soften in a bec with @xmath22 @xcite . within the limited range of results we have for @xmath76 we see evidence",
    "consistent with confinement induced effects playing an important role in the above @xmath4 hartree calculations .",
    "notably , that the relative difference between the stability boundaries of the hartree and semiclassical calculations scale with @xmath82 . also , when the system is unstable , during the self - consistency iterations ( prior to collapse ) strong radial density fluctuations develop in the system    a key prediction from our semiclassical study @xcite is a double instability feature in oblate trapping geometries arising from the interplay of thermal gas saturation and the anisotropy of the ddi .",
    "our hartree calculations in this oblate regime , despite shifting the stability boundary from the semiclassical prediction by a considerable amount , reveal that the double instability feature is robust to beyond - semiclassical effects .",
    "a prominent feature of the semiclassical calculation is that the stability curves for the purely dipolar gas terminate at the critical point with @xmath83 ( i.e.  predicting that without contact interactions only an ideal gas is stable below @xmath4 ) .",
    "this occurs because the local compressibility at trap center diverges at the critical point and the gas is unstable to any attractive interaction ( see @xcite ) . in the beyond - semiclassical calculations the trap provides a finite momentum cutoff that prevents the divergence of compressibility , and",

    "is well - established @xcite , particularly for the case of contact interactions ( e.g.  see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we present this theory for a system interacting with a ddi and consider the cases of above and below @xmath4 separately .",
    "the hartree - fock equation for the modes of an uncondensed dipolar bose gas is @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the single particle hamiltonian and @xmath119 are the first order coherence function and total density , respectively",
    ".      below @xmath4 an appreciable number of atoms condense into the lowest energy single particle mode , which we denote as the condensate mode @xmath20 with respective energy @xmath57 and occupation @xmath120 . in this regime",
    "the hartree - fock equations take the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 are the condensate and thermal first order coherence functions , and the total density , respectively .",
    "we have also introduced the projector @xmath123f(\\mathbf{y}),\\ ] ] to remove components of @xmath124 parallel to the condensate mode . the projection operator in eq .",
    "( [ hfuj ] ) acts to ensure that atoms within the condensate do not undergo an exchange interaction with themselves . in particular , when acting on the condensate mode eq .",
    "( [ hfuj ] ) reduces to the expected generalized gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath125u_0({\\mathbf{x}})\\label{hfu0}\\\\ & \\,+ { \\int d^3{\\mathbf{x}}'\\,u_{\\mathrm{dd}}({\\mathbf{x}}'-{\\mathbf{x}})\\tilde { g}({\\mathbf{x}}',{\\mathbf{x}})u_0({\\mathbf{x } } ' ) } , \\ , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has direct interactions with condensate and thermal atoms , but only thermal exchange .",
    "the projector also ensures that the modes @xmath126 form an orthonormal set ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .      the full numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ hfuj ] ) [ or even eq .  ( [ hfujabovetc ] ) ] is extremely challenging , because the thermal exchange requires @xmath127 to be calculated ( or at least applied ) for each self - consistent iteration .",
    "this limits the theory to applications involving a small number of modes and away from regimes where mechanical stability can be studied .",
    "the hartree theory we use is obtained by neglecting both condensate and thermal exchange terms [ as labeled in eqs .",
    "( [ hfuj ] ) ] , yielding @xmath128u_j({\\mathbf{x } } ) \\label{huj},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] [ i.e.  eq .  [ hu ] ] .",
    "the absence of exchange terms means that a projector is no longer needed .",
    "the properties of the hartree , hartree - fock and other theories for the homogeneous bose condensed gas , including conservation laws , are extensively discussed in sec .",
    "@xcite ( also see @xcite for a discussion of the hfb and hfbp theories of the inhomogeneous system ) .",
    "we note that in the uniform purely dipolar gas , the hartree term is zero and the ddis affect the system only though the fock term .",
    "however , in the trapped system the hartree term is often dominant , particularly when the harmonic trap is appreciably anisotropic ( i.e. @xmath129 or @xmath130 ) .",
    "in this section we discuss our implementation of the hartree model as a numerical algorithm .",
    "the hartree equation ( [ hu ] ) is cylindrically symmetric and can be solved using a set of two - dimensional grids . however ,",
    "at finite temperature typically @xmath131 modes are thermally accessible in the regimes we study , and a full self - consistent calculation is not feasible in terms of the discrete ( i.e.  diagonalized ) modes .",
    "instead we employ a hybrid method and diagonalize for the lowest energy modes , up to some energy @xmath132 , and then calculate the remainder within the semiclassical approach [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic](a ) ] .",
    "the semiclassical approach can be obtained by making the replacement @xmath133 in eq .",
    "( [ hu ] ) , where @xmath134 is a wavevector .",
    "this transforms the hartree equation to an algebraic equation in which the energy is given in ( @xmath135-phase - space as @xmath136 where the effective potential was defined in eq .",
    "( [ veff ] ) .",
    "the semiclassical portion of the system is described by a ( wigner ) distribution function @xmath137}-1\\}^{-1}$ ] . for consistency the semiclassical description",
    "can only be applied to regions of phase - space where @xmath138 to avoid double counting of modes . from this",
    "we obtain the semiclassical region density @xmath139},\\beta k_{\\min}({\\mathbf{x}})\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 is the incomplete bose function and @xmath141      all the excitations up to a given energy @xmath132 are solved for using the arnoldi algorithm .",
    "the associated discrete mode density is constructed @xmath142 the semiclassical and the total densities are then evaluated @xmath143 we use fixed point iteration of these steps to ensure self consistency . to avoid oscillations only a small amount of the new prediction for the total density @xmath144",
    "is mixed in with the existing prediction @xmath145 , i.e. @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the mixing parameter . upon obtaining a self - consistent solution external parameters",
    "are adjusted to tune the solutions to a desired macrostate ( e.g.  an outer loop of @xmath18 being adjusted to obtain the correct total number @xmath54 ) .      1 .",
    "we make use of fourier - hankel techniques @xcite to utilize the cylindrical symmetry and reduce the eigenvalue problem to being two - dimensional .",
    "the fourier - hankel approach is useful because it allows accurate fourier transforms to simplify the evaluation of the convolution required to construct the direct dipolar interaction .",
    "however , the radial hankel transform requires a different radial grid for each angular momentum projection quantum number @xmath67 , thus the problem requires a set of two - dimensional grids ( we typically diagonalize modes with @xmath67 up to @xmath148 , i.e.  requiring 11 grids  generally even more in oblate geometries ) .",
    "this requires extensive transformation of quantities [ e.g.  @xmath72 ] between the grids .",
    "we use a _ cutoff dipole interaction potential _ for improved accuracy and to reduce the size of the numerical grids needed .",
    "the cutoff potential minimizes interaction between aliased copies of the system ( problematic with fourier methods used for systems with long - range interactions ) .",
    "we make use of both the cylindrical cutoff suggested in @xcite and the spherical version developed in @xcite .",
    "we use two grid extents as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic](b ) .",
    "since we only calculate the discrete modes up to some relatively small energy , @xmath132 , we can use a small and dense set of grids to accurately perform the diagonalizations [ and obtain @xmath150 .",
    "then a much larger grid is used for the semiclassical region which extends out to much higher energy , as needed to accurately capture the thermal tails of the system .",
    "4 .   in application to mechanical stability , finding self - consistent solutions is challenging and care needs to be taken to ensure that metastable states are not lost prematurely and that a coarse grid does not disguise instability . in using fixed point iteration effectively ,",
    "we employ an algorithm to efficiently increase or decrease the mixing speed @xmath147 during the self - consistent process .",
    "we have observed that if @xmath147 is too large early on in self - consistency iterations a metastable solution may be lost .",
    "normally we start with @xmath151 ( @xmath152 for biconcave density regions ) and appropriately increase or decrease this during the search for a self - consistent solutions depending upon conditions .",
    "we also note that care needs to be taken to reliably detect mechanical instability collapse .",
    "we perform a number of tests to determine instability including detecting the development of density spikes and large gaps in the low energy spectrum .",
    "we have confirmed that these are good signatures of the grid dependent numerical collapse discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : locateinstability ] .      in oblate geometries",
    "the self consistent calculations above @xmath4 become increasingly difficult to perform as @xmath75 increases .",
    "for this reason we have not extended our calculations beyond @xmath81 .",
    "the origin of the difficulty is two fold : ( i ) the effective potential flattens considerably which increases the low energy density of states , meaning that a large number of modes exist below @xmath132 .",
    "( ii ) in oblate geometries the interaction strengths at instability are much larger , and these numerous low energy modes interact strongly with each other .",
    "the important convergence test is that our results are independent of the boundary ( @xmath132 ) separating the discrete low energy modes from the continuous semiclassical spectrum .",
    "the typical error bars shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : stab ] and [ fig : stablog ] represent the variation in the stability boundary as @xmath132 was varied ( 1 @xmath69 spread obtained from tests where the number of discrete modes ranged over @xmath87 10 to 1000 ) .",
    "it is not computationally feasible for us to take @xmath132 high enough for @xmath153 ( above @xmath4 ) to get a self - consistent result fully independent of @xmath132 .",
    "however , note we do not observe a systematic drift nor monotonic relationship between @xmath132 and the stability boundary .",
