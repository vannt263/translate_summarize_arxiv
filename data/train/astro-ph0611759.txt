    "2004 , hogg et al .",
    "2003 , cooper et al .",

    "we have studied the relationship between color distribution and environment taking advantage of the large complete sample of galaxies in the cfhtlsd .",
    "a local density estimator has been derived for each object based on the distance to the 10th closest neighbour d : @xmath47 , where d is the projected linear distance at @xmath25  .",
    "close neighbours are selected within a photometric redshift slice @xmath25  @xmath48 , with m@xmath36 in the [ -24,-20 ] interval .",

    "the blue population dominates the lowest density and faintest luminosity bins , whereas the red population is found to dominate the highest density and brightest luminosity bins .",
    "these general trends seem more sensitive to the luminosity than to the local density . at @xmath50",
    ", a bright blue population appears even in the densest regions , increasing with redshift .    in conclusion , the optimal combination of homogeneous wavelength coverage and photometric depth on the large effective area achieved by the cfhtlsd t0003 allows the study of photometrical properties of galaxies with unprecedented accuracy .",
