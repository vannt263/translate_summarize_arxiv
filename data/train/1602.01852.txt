    "the knot quandle @xmath5 is an algebraic knot invariant that can be derived from a diagram of @xmath3 . in @xcite , @xcite",
    ", joyce proves that the knot quandle is a complete invariant of unoriented knots .",
    "however , as with knot groups , it is easy to obtain a presentation of the quandle , but hard to determine if two presentations yield isomorphic quandles . passing to the @xmath6-quandle , @xmath7 , a certain quotient of @xmath5 , yields a more tractable knot invariant about which much is still unknown .",
    "this paper is one piece of a larger project to tabulate all links with finite @xmath6-quandles and furthermore to explicitly describe those quandles .",
    "we hope to complete this project in future publications .    combining results of joyce @xcite , @xcite , and winker @xcite",
    ", it follows that if @xmath7 is finite , then @xmath8 is finite , where @xmath9 is the the @xmath6-fold cyclic branched cover of @xmath10 , branched over @xmath3 . in this paper",
    ", we examine the class of montesinos links @xmath0 , which we call @xmath1-montesinos links , and which are known to have 2-fold cyclic branched covers with finite fundamental group .",
    "we show that their 2-quandles , also known as _",
    "quandles , are in fact finite .",
    "moreover , we carefully describe the nature of these quandles .",
    "our main result is the following theorem .",
    "[ main theorem ] if @xmath0 is a @xmath1-montesinos link with @xmath11 , + @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , then the order of @xmath14 is @xmath15 .    in section  [ quandles ] , we review basic material about involutory quandles and describe the diagramming method introduced by winker  @xcite used to find a cayley graph of a quandle .",
    "then , in section  [ 22rmontesinos ] we describe the @xmath1-montesinos links and derive a presentation for their involutory quandles .",
    "we then employ winker s method in section  [ cayley graphs ] to compute the involutory quandles of these links , describing the quandle by means of its cayley graph . finally , in section  [ properties ] , we describe several properties of these quandles .",
    "in this section we quickly review the definition of the fundamental quandle of a link and its associated involutory quandle .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for more detailed information .",
    "a _ quandle _ is a set @xmath16 together with two binary operations @xmath17 and @xmath18 which satisfies the following three axioms .",
    "* @xmath19 for all @xmath20 . * @xmath21 for all @xmath22 . *",
    "@xmath23 for all @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath25 is an oriented knot or link in @xmath4 , then a presentation of its _ fundamental quandle _ , @xmath26 , can be derived from a regular diagram @xmath27 of @xmath25 .",
    "this process mimics the wirtinger algorithm .",
    "namely , assign a quandle generator @xmath28 to each arc of @xmath27 , then at each crossing introduce a relation as follows .",
    "suppose the overcrossing strand is labeled @xmath29 while the undercrossing strand to the left ( using the orientation of the overcrossing strand ) is labeled @xmath30 and the undercrossing strand to the right is labeled @xmath31 .",
    "then @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to check that the three riedemeister moves do not change the quandle given by this presentation so that the quandle is indeed an invariant of the oriented link .",
    "it is important to note that the operation @xmath17 is , in general , not associative . throughout this paper",
    ", we will assume that any expression without parentheses is to be grouped in left - associated form .",
    "for example , the expression @xmath33 should be taken to be @xmath34 .",
    "it is an interesting exercise to show that the quandle axioms can be used to rewrite every product in left - associated form .",
    "thus , there is no loss of generality in working entirely with left - associated products .",
    "a quandle is called _ involutory _ if @xmath35 . in an involutory quandle axiom a2",
    "becomes + @xmath36 for all @xmath22 .",
    "the involutory quandle for a knot or link is presented in the same manner as its fundamental quandle except that the orientation of the link is now irrelevant .",
    "the involutory quandle of a link @xmath25 will be denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the involutory quandle of a link may be thought of as a quotient of the fundamental quandle and in general one should expect a significant loss of information in passing from @xmath26 to @xmath14 .",
    "all quandles considered in this paper will be involutory quandles .",
    "finally , we adopt the exponential notation used in @xcite , denoting @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "this has the advantage of further clarifying the ambiguity caused by lack of associativity .",
    "now @xmath39 will be taken to mean @xmath40 whereas @xmath41 will mean @xmath42 .",
    "the following lemma from @xcite , which describes how to re - associate a product in an involutory quandle , will be used repeatedly in this paper .    if @xmath43 are elements of an involutory quandle , then @xmath44 [ leftassoc ]    one of the main tools we use in this paper is winker s method to produce the cayley graph of an involutory quandle from a given presentation @xcite .",
    "the method is similar to the well - known todd - coxeter method of enumerating cosets of a subgroup of a group @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath14 is presented as @xmath45 where each @xmath46 is a word in the generators .",
    "if @xmath47 is any element of the quandle , then it follows from lemma  [ leftassoc ] that @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the word @xmath50 written backwards .",
    "winker calls this relation the _ secondary relation _ associated to the _ primary relation _ @xmath51 .",
    "winker s method now proceeds as follows .    1 .",
    "begin with one vertex for each generator @xmath30 , labeled with the integer @xmath52 .",
    "2 .   add a loop at each vertex @xmath30 , labeled @xmath30 .",
    "( this encodes axiom a1 . )",
    "3 .   using each primary relation @xmath51 ,",
    "in their given order , introduce vertices and edges as necessary to create the path from @xmath53 to @xmath54 given by @xmath46 .",
    "this process is called _ tracing _ the primary relation .",
    "vertices are labeled with consecutive integers in the order they are introduced and edges are labeled with the corresponding generator .",
    "tracing the @xmath52-th relation may introduce like - labeled edges sharing a vertex which we now identify , possibly leading to other necessary identifications .",
    "this process is called _ collapsing _ and all collapsing is carried out before tracing the @xmath55-st relation .",
    "4 .   proceeding in order through the list of vertices , trace and collapse each secondary relation ( in order ) .",
    "all secondary relations are traced and collapsed at vertex @xmath52 before proceeding to vertex @xmath56 .",
    "if the method terminates in a finite graph , then this is the cayley graph of the quandle .",
    "however , the method may not terminate .",
    "the reader is referred to winker  @xcite for more details .",
    "for example , let @xmath3 be the the standard 3-crossing diagram of the right - handed trefoil knot . if the arcs are labeled @xmath57 , and @xmath58 in order as we traverse the knot , then we obtain the presentation @xmath59 of its involutory quandle .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , presentations can be changed by the analog of tietze transformations .",
    "here we can eliminate @xmath58 obtaining @xmath60 to which we now apply winker s method .",
    "after the first two steps , we arrive at the graph shown in figure  [ trefoil ] . tracing the single secondary relation , @xmath61 at each of the vertices ( in order ) introduces no additional vertices and requires no collapsing .",
    "therefore , this is the cayley graph of the involutory quandle of the right - handed trefoil knot .",
    "consider the unoriented montesinos link @xmath62 , shown in figure  [ generalmontesinos ] , where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . here",
    "the box labelled @xmath66 denotes the rational tangle determined by the fraction @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the number of right - handed half - twists . by making use of flypes",
    ", we may change each numerator @xmath68 by multiples of @xmath69 at the expense of changing @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , if some @xmath68 is replaced with @xmath70 , then we replace @xmath67 with @xmath71 .",
    "hence by allowing arbitrary values for @xmath67 , we may assume that @xmath72 for each tangle .",
    "in addition , cyclic permutation of the tangles together with rotation around a vertical axis allows us to assume @xmath73 .",
    "the reader is directed to @xcite for more information on montesinos links . for the remainder of the paper we consider the link @xmath74 .",

    "we illustrate this process with the link @xmath75 shown in figure  [ montesinoslink ] .",

    ". first note that by moving from left to right through the @xmath67 right - handed half - twists in the upper part of the diagram , the two arcs to the right receive labels of @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are some words in the generators 1 and 2 that depend on @xmath67 .",
    "next , if we follow the strand labeled @xmath82 into the @xmath76 tangle , we will come out at one of the other four endpoints of the tangle and obtain a second relation .",
    "similarly , following the other string in this 2-string tangle gives the third relation .    ]",
    "we begin by determining @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which are easily found by induction on @xmath67 . in the following lemma , and throughout the paper ,",

    "it is easy to see that the vertex type of @xmath183 depends only on @xmath83 and the type of @xmath182 .",
    "thus , each word @xmath83 determines a permutation of the set of four types of vertices .",
    "let @xmath184 denote this permutation .",

    "if tracing the word @xmath83 starting at vertex @xmath182 in @xmath178 ends in vertex @xmath183 , then let @xmath187 denote the vector @xmath188 in the plane .",
