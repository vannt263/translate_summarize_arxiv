    "how rapidly ( or how slowly ) can a state evolve ?",
    "this question has been approached @xcite through the survival probability of the state : @xmath2 which is the probability that the system , initially in state @xmath3 , will be found to be still in that state after time @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath5 is assumed to be independent of the time .",
    "lower bounds to @xmath6 have been established @xcite in terms of the energy uncertainty @xmath7 , but these bounds can be well below the actual evolution . also it has been claimed @xcite that there can be no upper bound ( other than @xmath8 ) in terms of @xmath9 alone ; without an upper bound one can not be sure that the state will change at all . here , upper and lower bounds will be found in terms of higher energy moments .",
    "expanding the exponential in eq.([eq : pdef ] ) as a power series gives @xmath10 where @xmath11 , the @xmath12-th energy moment .",
    "the absence of a linear term in this expansion is important to the discussion of the quantum zeno effect @xcite .",
    "there are good reasons why @xmath13 and @xmath14 should exist @xcite , but for many states used in physics some of the higher energy moments do not exist .",
    "it will be established in section [ sec : bounds ] that , apart from the factor @xmath15 , the coefficient of @xmath16 in eq.([eq : pseries ] ) must be positive if it exists , and that the partial sums of this series give alternately upper and lower bounds to @xmath6 ; an upper bound if the last included term is positive or a lower bound if the last included term is negative .",
    "section [ sec : cutoff ] introduces a cut - off in the energy , equivalent to projecting onto a finite - energy subspace .",
    "this enables considerable improvement in these bounds ( including the one in terms of @xmath9 ) and also allows the method to be used where the exact energy moments do not exist .",
    "we first need to show that the coefficients in eq.([eq : pseries ] ) are moments over the autocorrelation of the energy distribution .",
    "consider a complete set of commuting observables @xmath17 with common eigenstates @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "( in general , @xmath21 represents a set of operators and @xmath22 a set of eigenvalues . ) then , for any function @xmath23 of the hamiltonian , @xmath24 define the energy distribution @xmath25 . then @xmath26 and @xmath27 for example , @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be the lower and upper bounds to the energies for which @xmath31 is non - zero , but allow the possibility that @xmath32 and even the unphysical case that @xmath33 .",
    "the survival probability @xmath6 is not changed by a shift in energy and for all the examples used here @xmath34 or @xmath35 . in terms of @xmath31 ,",
    "@xmath36 change the integration variables from @xmath37 to @xmath38 with @xmath39 , and introduce the autocorrelation of @xmath31 through the even function @xmath40 then @xmath41 is never negative and @xmath42 also @xmath43 .",

    "we first show that the partial sums of the taylor series for @xmath57 provide alternately upper and lower bounds to @xmath57 . to prove this , note that if we have an upper ( or lower ) bound to @xmath57 for all @xmath58 , applying @xmath59 gives an upper ( lower ) bound to @xmath60 . then applying @xmath61 gives a lower ( upper ) bound to @xmath57 .",

    "using this sequence of inequalities for @xmath57 , it follows directly from eq.([eq : p - w ] ) that @xmath63 and so on . whereas the series eq.([eq : p - e ] ) for @xmath6 may or may not converge , each of these bounds is valid provided the moments @xmath46 in it exist .",

    "[ fig:7 - 2seq ] shows these bounds for selected values of @xmath101 using the quadratic lower bound in eq.(23 ) and the quartic upper bound in eq.(24 ) .",
    "it is now clear that the bounds from a given cut - off @xmath101 are good only for a limited range of the time and the best we can do with each of the bounds in eqs.([eq : a2]-[eq : a6 ] ) is to calculate the envelope as @xmath101 varies .",
    "each bound to @xmath100 is given by a function @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a polynomial of degree @xmath12 in @xmath4 .",

    ". none of the bounds in eqs.([eq : p2]-[eq : p6 ] ) can be used , but cutting off all energies outside the range @xmath118 to @xmath119 gives the bounds shown in fig .  [",

    "this causes the envelope to be valid only for times greater than @xmath155 given by @xmath156 at @xmath154 .",
    "but the envelope will match smoothly to the bound without cut - off at that time , because the envelope osculates the sequence of bounds as @xmath101 approaches @xmath30 .",
