    "[ sec : introduction ]    compton scattering @xmath15 at energies below @xmath16 explores the two - photon response of the internal low - energy degrees of freedom in the nucleon and in the lightest nuclei . since the electric and magnetic fields of a real photon induce radiation multipoles by displacing the charged constituents and currents in the target , energy - dependence and multipolarity of the emitted radiation test the symmetries and strengths of the interactions between and with them ;",
    "see a recent review for details  @xcite . in deuteron compton scattering , one not only has access to the proton and neutron response , but also to how photons couple to the charged pion - exchange currents , thus testing nuclear binding in the simplest stable few - nucleon system .",
    "in addition , the constructive interference with the @xmath10 wave component of the deuteron can be expected to lead to increased sensitivity of the hadronic response to the quadrupole components of the photon fields .",
    "a new generation of high - luminosity facilities like hi@xmath17s , mami and max - lab with near-@xmath18 linear or circular beam polarisation have started to explore these opportunities .",
    "dense deuteron targets with vector polarisations approaching @xmath19 are standard .",
    "since tensor and vector polarisations are related when in thermal equilibrium with a solid lattice , most vector - polarised deuteron targets automatically also provide tensor polarisation degrees of @xmath20  and the potential for greater values in dedicated set - ups  @xcite .    now is thus an opportune moment for a comprehensive classification of independent deuteron amplitudes and observables .",
    "the spin-@xmath21 case has been discussed by babusci et al .",
    "@xcite . for the deuteron , chen , ji and li",
    "@xcite constructed a basis for those @xmath3 amplitudes which remain linearly independent after parity and time - reversal invariance have been invoked on the @xmath22(photon helicities)@xmath23(deuteron helicities)@xmath24 ^ 2$](both in- and out - state)@xmath25 helicity amplitudes . however , a corresponding list of 23 independent observables ( @xmath3 complex amplitudes minus an overall phase ) is missing . while several single and double polarisation observables have been constructed and their sensitivity to the nucleon polarisabilities explored  @xcite , no systematic study of vector and tensor polarisation observables exists .",
    "only one tensor observable has been considered explicitly , namely for an unpolarised beam  @xcite .",
    "what is more , some deuteron `` vector '' observables which were defined analogous to the spin-@xmath21 case will be shown to actually receive contributions from both vector and tensor polarisations .",
    "for the case that the polarisations of the final state are not detected , this work aims to classify all @xmath1 independent observables and their relation to the helicity amplitudes . at present , this seems to be the experimentally most feasible situation . instead of simply extending the work by babusci et al .",
    "to the spin-@xmath0 case , the starting point is the most general cross section of an arbitrarily polarised photon beam on an arbitrarily polarised spin-@xmath0 target , in a form which is well - known e.g.  from deuteron photo - disintegration  @xcite .",
    "it is parametrised in terms of the unpolarised cross section , @xmath0 beam and @xmath2 target asymmetries as well as @xmath3 double asymmetries and has the added benefit that experiments in less - than - ideal settings can easily be described as well , like when residual or mixed target and beam polarisations exist .",
    "a future publication will define and study @xmath7 additional independent polarisation transfer observables  @xcite .",
    "a complete set of independent compton scattering observables will then be available from which the @xmath26 real parameters which characterise deuteron compton scattering ( i.e.  its independent amplitudes ) can be reconstructed in full .",
    "the second part of this article explores the sensitivity of the @xmath1 observables to the two - photon response of the individual nucleon .",
    "remember that the proportionality constants between the electric or magnetic field of the incident photon and the radiation multipoles induced in each nucleon are the energy - dependent ( dynamical ) polarisabilities of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "they parametrise the stiffness of the nucleon @xmath27 ( spin @xmath28 ) against transitions @xmath29 of definite photon multipolarity at frequency @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ; @xmath33 ; @xmath34 ) ; see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "re - written as point - like interactions between photons and nucleons , the terms which contain photon dipoles read : @xmath35\\;n \\end{split}\\ ] ] since each interaction with a photon leaves a unique signal in such dispersive effects , compton scattering allows one to study the symmetries and dynamics of the hadronic constituents in detail .",
    "the zero - energy values , @xmath36 etc . , are often quoted as `` the ( static ) polarisabilities '' .",
    "two scalar polarisabilities @xmath37 and @xmath38 parametrise electric and magnetic dipole transitions .",
    "the four dipole spin polarisabilities @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 encode the response of the nucleon spin - structure . these are particularly interesting since , intuitively interpreted , they parametrise the bi - refringence which the electromagnetic field associated with the spin degrees causes in the nucleon , in analogy to the classical faraday - effect  @xcite .",
    "the information accessible in compton scattering thus goes well beyond that in tests of the one - photon response e.g.  in form - factor experiments .",
    "theoretical input is of course needed to carefully evaluate data - consistency in one model - independent framework for hidden systematic errors ; identify the underlying mechanisms using minimal theoretical bias , like the detailed chiral dynamics of the pion cloud and of the @xmath4 as the lowest nucleon resonance ; and , most importantly , explain how these findings emerge from qcd by relating to emerging lattice simulations ( see most recently  @xcite ) .",
    "the polarisabilities also enter as one of the bigger sources of uncertainties in theoretical determinations of the proton - neutron mass shift ( see e.g.  most recently @xcite ) and of the two - photon - exchange contribution to the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "while presumably not providing a solution to the proton - charge - radius puzzle , they also contribute in radiative corrections to this process , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "for all these goals , chiral effective field theory ( @xmath43eft ) , the low - energy theory of qcd and extension of chiral perturbation theory to few - nucleon systems , adds objective estimates of the theoretical uncertainties . indeed , @xmath43efthas been particularly successful in describing proton and few - nucleon compton scattering , starting with the first calculation and sensitivity study of the scalar polarisabilities in @xmath43eft  @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite contains details on its history and status in compton scattering , as well as on @xmath43eftvariants not discussed here .",
    "having established a consistent database from all available proton and deuteron data below @xmath44 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the static scalar polarisabilities of the proton were recently extracted in this framework with a @xmath45 per degree of freedom of @xmath46  @xcite : @xmath47 throughout , polarisabilities without superscripts denote isoscalar quantities , and the canonical units of @xmath48 for scalar and @xmath49 for spin dipole polarisabilities are understood .    since the deuteron is an isoscalar , elastic scattering on it provides of course only access to the isoscalar ( average ) nucleon polarisabilities . in ref .",
    "@xcite , these were found to have much larger errors since deuteron data is less accurate and more scarce ( with @xmath50d.o.f.@xmath51 ) : @xmath52 these results were derived using the baldin sum rules , whose isoscalar variant reads  @xcite : @xmath53 these publications also discuss in detail the fit procedure and residual theoretical uncertainties . comparing eqs .   and   shows that within the data - dominated error , the two - photon responses of the proton and neutron as parametrised by the scalar polarisabilities are identical . a particularly interesting prediction of @xmath43eftis that small proton - neutron differences stem from chiral - symmetry breaking interactions with and in the pion cloud around the nucleon , probing details of qcd",
    "experiments are therefore underway and planned to improve the compton scattering database ; see e.g.  @xcite for details .",
    "their other focus are the spin polarisabilities . only the linear combinations @xmath54 and @xmath55 of scattering under @xmath56 and @xmath57 are somewhat constrained by data or phenomenology .",
    "conflicting results from mami and legs exist for the proton , and large error - bars are found for the neutron  @xcite .",
    "the isoscalar values are in the range ( see also  @xcite ) : @xmath58 \\end{split}\\ ] ] a comprehensive classification of independent amplitudes and observables is thus warranted , including a detailed study of dependencies on scalar and spin polarisabilities .",

    "the results mostly confirm those of refs .",
    "@xcite and thus are only summarised here .",
    "rescattering significantly affects all observables for energies @xmath336 and is important to reduce residual dependence on the nn potential and deuteron wave function up to @xmath11 , as predicted by the power - counting .",
    "details of the nn potential or deuteron wave function are not reflected in observables .",
    "for example , at @xmath6 , the largest wave - function dependencies are @xmath337 of the maximum in @xmath304 and @xmath338 of the maximum in @xmath306 .",
    "these observables are however quite small ( @xmath339 ) ; all other observables suffer from a residual wave - function dependence of @xmath340 at that energy , as tests with av18  @xcite , nijmegen 93  @xcite and other wave functions demonstrate .",
    "not surprising is also that @xmath4-effects become more pronounced with increasing energy .",
    "it is now well - understood that its spin - flip amplitude considerably changes the shape of the unpolarised differential cross section at backward angles  @xcite , thereby solving the `` sal puzzle '' of deuteron compton data at @xmath341  @xcite .",
    "while the influence of the delta on some observables like @xmath116 may be very small , it is hard to imagine an eft without it to be reliable at photon energies around @xmath6 . as case in point , @xmath306 is at @xmath6 increased by @xmath342 and changes shape when the delta is included ; @xmath288 increases by @xmath164 , while @xmath313 is reduced by @xmath343 , and @xmath298 even by @xmath342 .",
    "@xmath323 changes shape at forward angles .",
    "delta effects can not be neglected above about @xmath344 , especially in the large momentum transfers at back - angles .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ]    based on a well - known decomposition of the deuteron photo - dissociation cross section , this work presented a classification of all @xmath1 independent observables in compton scattering off an unpolarised , vector , tensor or mixed - polarised spin-@xmath0 target with unpolarised , circularly , linearly or mixed - polarised beam when final - state polarisations are not detected .",
    "the unpolarised cross section , beam asymmetry , @xmath2 target asymmetries and @xmath3 double asymmetries were expressed in terms of the helicity amplitudes and related to previously used , incomplete parametrisations .",
    "this decomposition is particularly transparent , with each observable readily translated into specific and well - known beam / target / detector combinations .",
    "the method was then applied to deuteron compton scattering in @xmath43eftwith dynamical @xmath4 degrees of freedom using amplitudes which are complete at order @xmath5 in the energy range from the thomson limit to just below the pion production threshold .",
    "since this process tests the isoscalar two - photon response of the nucleon , embedded in the simplest bound few - nucleon system  @xcite , the sensitivity of each observable on the @xmath282 dipole polarisabilities of the nucleon was studied . these , in turn , encode information on the symmetries and strengths of the interactions with and between the hadronic internal low - energy degrees of freedom .",
    "they characterise the radiation multipoles which are generated by displacing the charges and currents inside the nucleon in the electric or magnetic field of a photon with definite energy and multipolarity . to determine in particular the @xmath2 spin polarisabilities is the objective of a large - scale effort including hi@xmath17s , max - lab and mami , since they parametrise the response of the nucleon spin degrees of freedom but are not yet well - constrained .",
    "this study thus aids in planning and analysing experiments to determine the nucleon polarisabilities from deuteron compton scattering .",
    "an interactive _ mathematica 9.0 _ notebook of its results over a wide range of energies is available from ` hgrie@gwu.edu ` .    with future high - accuracy determinations of the scalar polarisabilities @xmath241 and @xmath242 at lower energies , the spin polarisabilities seem to be reliably extractable at energies of @xmath280 from the observables @xmath291 ( circularly - polarised beam on vector target ) , @xmath345 ( unpolarised beam on tensor target ) and @xmath346 ( linearly - polarised beam on tensor target ) .",
    "this experimentally challenging but realistic set consists of asymmetries which have maxima from @xmath329 to @xmath331 and are mostly sensitive to only 1 or 2 polarisabilities .",
    "modifying the spin polarisabilities by @xmath347 in them induces variations of @xmath328 to @xmath335 at @xmath6 .    since nuclear binding",
    "is mediated by charged pion - exchange currents to which the photons can couple , deuteron compton scattering concurrently tests the detailed symmetries and dynamics of the charged part of the two - nucleon interaction .",
    "the @xmath10 wave contributions of the deuteron wave function and of the pion - exchange currents lead to nonzero tensor observables . by interference with the quadrupole components of the incident and outgoing photon , these ,",
    "in turn , seem to be much more sensitive on the mixed spin polarisabilities @xmath8 and @xmath9 than any single - nucleon observable .",
    "one may thus speculate that their determination will first appear from deuteron data  if the necessary accuracy can be reached .",
    "ongoing work includes embedding the @xmath263 single - nucleon amplitudes of ref .",
    "@xcite for an extension to photon energies above the pion - production threshold , also with @xmath240-ful pion - exchange currents ; inclusion of a chirally consistent nn potential ; and a detailed assessment of theoretical uncertainties . in support of ongoing and",
    "planned experiments at hi@xmath17s , max - lab and mami , this effort is pursued in the context of a comprehensive theoretical description of compton scattering on the proton , deuteron and @xmath348hein @xmath43eft , valid from zero photon energy well into the @xmath240 resonance region .",
    "as pendant to the present article , a classification of the independent polarisation transfer observables on a spin-@xmath0 target will determine those @xmath7 which are linearly independent and complement those presented here for the complete set of @xmath26 independent observables  @xcite .",
    "from these , the @xmath26 independent real amplitudes can be reconstructed in turn , and hence all information accessible in the two - photon response of the deuteron and its constituents .    finally , i offer to embed single - nucleon compton amplitudes , chiral or not , into the available deuteron code , so that other theoretical descriptions can be tested collaboratively .",
    "i am particularly indebted to my compton collaborators j.  a.  mcgovern and d.  r.  phillips for discussions and encouragement , and to the organisers and participants of the int workshop 12 - 3 : `` light nuclei from first principles '' as well as the `` workshop to explore physics opportunities with intense , polarized electron beams with energy up to 300 mev '' at the mit , both of which also provided financial support . d.  g.  crabb and w.  meyer shared their expertise on tensor - polarised targets , and r.  schiavilla the crucial hint to ref .",
