    "the discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite completes not only the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , but gives also new constraints on any extension of it .",
    "the most studied extension of the sm to date is supersymmetry ( susy ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "however , the minimal - supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is facing increasing pressure over the last few years .",
    "one of the reasons is the measured higgs mass of 125  gev which is not trivial to accommodate in the mssm .",
    "the tree - level mass of the higgs has the strict upper limit @xmath0 , and one therefore needs large radiative corrections to push the mass to the required value .",
    "the two main possibilities within the mssm are either heavy stops , and/or a large mixing among them .",
    "the first option raises immediately the question about naturalness @xcite , while the second one can cause charge and colour breaking minima @xcite .",
    "+ for these reasons the interest in non - minimal susy models has increased in the last years . a widely studied approach to soften",
    "the need for large radiative corrections to the higgs mass is to increase the mass already at tree - level .",
    "this is done for instance in different singlet extensions via @xmath1-terms @xcite .",
    "the other option is to use @xmath2-terms @xcite .",
    "+ the simplest realisations of these ideas show the expected decoupling behaviour : as soon as the new sector responsible for the enhanced tree - level mass becomes heavy , the positive effect of the higgs mass shrinks .",
    "however , it has been shown that this decoupling can be circumvented at the price of introducing large soft - breaking masses .",
    "indeed , valid models with non - decoupling @xmath1- @xcite or @xmath2-terms @xcite have been successfully constructed . + we will consider in this letter the case of non - decoupling @xmath2-terms via a new abelian gauge group @xmath3 .",
    "so far , only the leading order effect on the higgs mass was studied in this scenario : the impact of the non - decoupling @xmath2-terms at tree - level in the case of vanishing gauge kinetic mixing was considered",
    ". we will show that ( i ) radiative corrections and ( ii ) the presence of gauge - kinetic mixing can give important corrections to this approximation .",
    "+ this letter is organised as follows : in [ sec : gkm ] a short excursion into gauge kinetic mixing in supersymmetric models is given , before in [ sec : model ] the origin of both effects in a concrete model is described .",
    "the impact on the higgs mass is analysed numerically in [ sec : numerics ] , before we summarise in [ sec : summary ] .",
    "if more than one abelian gauge group is present , mixing terms between the field strength tensors of the groups are allowed by gauge and lorentz invariance @xcite : @xmath4 here , @xmath5 are the field strength tensors of two different abelian groups @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 is in general an @xmath9 matrix if @xmath10 abelian groups are present . for practical applications",
    "it is often useful to bring the propagators of the vector bosons back into their canonical form by the redefinition @xcite @xmath11 the trade - off for this redefinition is a change in the covariant derivative : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the original diagonal matrix of @xmath10 individual gauge couplings associated to the @xmath10 abelian gauge factors , and @xmath14 is the vector of the relevant @xmath15 charges .",
    "thus , the @xmath16 factor can be translated into a new set of @xmath17 `` effective '' gauge couplings whose combinations populate off - diagonal entries of a gauge - coupling matrix @xmath18 in supersymmetric models , gauge kinetic mixing appears not only for the vector bosons , but also for both , the @xmath2-terms and the gaugino soft - breaking terms .",
    "of particular importance in the following are the new @xmath2-terms which read for the abelian sector @xmath19 while the non - abelian @xmath2-terms remain unchanged .",
    "+ for the special case of two abelian gauge groups , the most general form of @xmath20 reads @xmath21 in general , one has the freedom to perform a change in basis to bring @xmath20 into a particular form .",
    "the most commonly considered cases are the symmetric basis with @xmath22 and the triangle basis with @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the triangle basis has the advantage that the new scalars do not contribute to the electroweak vev , and the entire impact of gauge kinetic mixing is encoded in one new coupling @xmath25 .",
    "the relations between @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and the physical couplings called @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath25 are given by @xcite @xmath30",
    "in order to show the impact of loop corrections and gauge kinetic mixing on the higgs mass in the presence of non - decoupling @xmath2-terms , we take a model inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite as example charges of the new fields to allow for a seesaw type - i via the term @xmath31 . in this model ,",
    "the particle content of the mssm is extended by a gauge singlet superfield @xmath32 , a superfield for the right - handed neutrino and two fields @xmath33,@xmath34 responsible for the breaking of @xmath3 .",
    "it has also been shown that this model , when extended in addition by three generations of vector - like leptons and quarks , provides an attractive explanation for the diphoton excess observed at 750  gev by atlas and cms @xcite .",
    ".charges of the superfields under @xmath3 .",
    "the superfields in addition to the mssm particle content are singlets under the sm gauge group . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath3 charges of all superfields are summarised in [ tab : u1xmssmparticles ] , while the most general superpotential in agreement with all global and local symmetries is given by @xmath35 for simplicity , we will neglect in the following @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath8 as well as their soft - breaking terms .",
    "in addition , the soft - breaking term of @xmath38 can always be shifted away .",
    "the relevant soft - breaking terms in the scalar sector are @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "+ electroweak symmetry breaking and the breaking of @xmath3 are triggered by the following scalars receiving vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath41 in addition , a vev for the scalar singlet is induced in general @xmath42 we define @xmath43 , @xmath44 as well as @xmath45 , and @xmath46",
    ". one can use the five tadpole equations @xmath47 to eliminate five free parameters .",
    "we are doing this in the following for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the remaining free parameters in the scalar sector are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath36 , @xmath55 and the vevs . in all numerical studies",
    "we are going to fix @xmath56  tev , and @xmath57 .",
    "the neutral higgs mass matrix can be written in the basis @xmath58 as @xmath59 with the abbreviations @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "we have used the relations @xmath63 , @xmath64,@xmath65 , @xmath66 , and took the limit @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "the lightest eigenstate of the @xmath69 sub - system is approximated by @xmath70 here , we made use of @xmath71 and assumed @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , we replaced @xmath73 as well as @xmath74 for clarity by the full expressions .",
    "we find the expected limits    * @xmath75 : @xmath76 * @xmath77 : @xmath78    thus , we have the desired @xmath2-term enhancement for very large soft - terms , which is , however , modified by the presence of the off - diagonal gauge coupling @xmath79 .",
    "as long as @xmath79 is small , the impact of gauge kinetic mixing will be negligible .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath79 is treated as free parameter , it can be set to zero at a given scale .",
    "however , via renormalisation group effects ( rge ) it will be induced radiatively if the two abelian gauge groups are not orthogonal .",
    "orthogonality in this respect means that the anomalous dimension matrix defined by @xmath80 is diagonal . here",
    ", @xmath81 and @xmath82 run over all @xmath15 groups and the trace runs over all superfields charged under the corresponding group . in",
    "many commonly studied @xmath15 extension as @xmath83 , @xmath84 is not diagonal @xcite .",
    "even if the two abelian groups can be embedded in a singlet gut group , gauge kinetic mixing might appear for the remaining _ light _ degrees of freedom @xcite . calculating the anomalous dimension matrix for the model under consideration ,",
    "one finds large off - diagonal entries @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a diagonal matrix containing the gut normalisation .",
    "since we do nt assume any gut embedding here , we use @xmath87 in the following . at the one - loop level",
    "one can calculate the value of @xmath25 at the susy scale as function of ( i ) the scale @xmath88 where @xmath79 is assumed to vanish and ( ii ) the value for @xmath29 at this scale .",
    "the running of the gauge coupling matrix @xmath20 at one - loop is given by @xcite @xmath89 one has to ensure to bring @xmath20 to the particular basis defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basis ] ) after the running .",
    "the result is shown in [ fig : gkm ] .     at 1  tev as function of the scale @xmath88 where gauge kinetic mixing vanishes and @xmath29 at the scale . ]",
    "one finds that @xmath25 is in general negative , and only for a very low cut - off @xmath88 is the new coupling @xmath79 is much smaller than @xmath29 . for @xmath90  gev and large @xmath29 , @xmath91",
    "can already be as large as 0.1 , while for a gut motivated scenario with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath79 can even be as large as 0.40.5@xmath94 .",
    "are considered , it can be wrong to neglect gauge - kinetic mixing .",
    "although the impact on the higgs mass might not be important , crucial effects for instance concerning @xmath95 searches @xcite or dark matter properties @xcite could be missed . ] for completeness , we want to mention that the possibility of positive ratios @xmath96 exists : this can appear for very large , but negative values of @xmath29 at the scale @xmath88 .      because of the non - vanishing charge of the higgs doublets under the new gauge group , many additional radiative contributions to the higgs mass arise already at one - loop",
    ". the feynman diagrams with possible contributions proportional to @xmath29 are depicted in [ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "since the right - sfermions carry also a @xmath97 charge , they give also non - vanishing diagrams at one - loop .",
    "however , it can be shown that the tadpole and self - energy corrections cancel exactly for them .",
    "proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "the scalar contributions are summarised by @xmath99 , but for the case where only pseudo - scalars ( @xmath100 ) can appear .",
    "@xmath101 label the generations in the loop . ]",
    "the loop corrected scalar masses are the eigenvalues of the radiatively corrected mass matrix @xmath102 given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the sum of tadpole- and self - energy contributions .",
    "the pole masses @xmath105 are then associated with the eigenvalues of @xmath106 . + for the calculation of the diagrams it is necessary to diagonalise the mass matrices of the particles in the loop , which have dimensions up to @xmath107 .",
    "thus , most contributions can only be calculated numerically . only for the charged higgs contribution we can find an analytical estimate for the impact",
    "on the sm - like higgs mass which is mainly given by the change in the ( 2,2)-element of @xmath108 : @xmath109 @xmath110 is the renormalisation scale and we used the limit @xmath111 . in order to give an impression of the importance of all other loop corrections , we group all diagrams into four sets : ( i ) diagrams involving only neutralinos ( @xmath112 ) , ( ii ) diagrams involving only neutral cp - even scalars ( @xmath113 ) , ( iii ) diagrams involving only charged higgs scalars ( @xmath114 ) , ( iv ) diagrams with cp - odd scalars , the new gauge boson and the corresponding ghost ( @xmath100 , @xmath95 , @xmath115 ) .",
    "one has to consider the fields in the last group together , in order to have a gauge invariant set of diagrams . in [ fig : pis ] we show the values of the corrections to the ( 2,2)-element of the higgs mass matrix as function of @xmath29 for the case of vanishing kinetic mixing , @xmath116  tev and @xmath117  tev .     as function of @xmath29 for the diagrams involving only ( i ) neutralinos (",
    "green , dot - dashed ) , ( ii ) cp - even scalars ( blue , dashed ) , ( iii ) charged higgs ( orange , dotted ) , ( iv ) cp - odd scalars , @xmath95 and its ghost ( red , full ) . ]",
    "one can see that the main loop corrections come from the charged and cp - even scalar sector .",
    "since both are negative , one can expect that the new loop corrections reduce the sm - like higgs mass , i.e. they might compensate to some extent the positive effect at tree - level .",
    "the corrections stemming from neutralinos are comparable small , while the ones involving the @xmath95 , its goldstone boson and its ghost are even smaller .",
    "there is also an indirect effect of the extended gauge sector on the mssm - like corrections to the higgs mass : the new force changes the relation between the measured sm parameters and the running @xmath118values which enter the loop calculations .",
    "the most important parameter in this respect is the top yukawa coupling @xmath119 . as it can be seen from [ fig : yt ] , the change in the running coupling @xmath120 is only very small when turning up @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the change in the loop corrections is only very tiny .     at the susy scale @xmath121  tev as function of @xmath29 .",
    "the red , dashed line is for @xmath122  tev and the blue , full line for @xmath123  tev . ]",
    "we turn now to the discussion of the impact on the sm - like higgs mass of the two effects described in the last section . for this purpose ,",
    "we make use of the spheno@xcite output of sarah@xcite .",
    "the sarahgenerated fortrancode provides a fully fledged spectrum generator for the model which enables a calculation of the entire mass spectrum at the one - loop level without any approximation : any loop contribution and the full momentum dependence is included . in principle , sphenoincludes also new two - loop corrections for the model under consideration @xcite .",
    "however , these are so far only available in the gaugeless limit , i.e. the corrections we are mainly interested in are not covered .",
    "+ we show in [ fig : gxgtmh ] the shifts of the sm - like higgs mass at tree - level and at the one - loop level for @xmath124  tev in the @xmath125-plane compared to the case @xmath126 .",
    "one sees that the enhancement in the higgs mass when including loop effects and/or gauge - kinetic mixing is always smaller than the push at tree - level when neglecting these effects . assuming a fixed ratio @xmath127 , gauge kinetic mixing becomes more important for larger @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast the ( relative ) impact of the loop corrections has only a mild dependence on the considered value of @xmath29 .",
    "this can be seen in [ fig : rel_t_l ] where the shifts @xmath128 and @xmath129 defined by @xmath130 are shown as function of @xmath29 and for different combinations of @xmath131 and @xmath54 .     as defined in [ eq : d1,eq : d2 ] as function of @xmath29 . here",
    ", we put @xmath132 and assumed @xmath133  tev [ red , dashed],@xmath134  tev [ orange , dot - dotted],@xmath135  tev [ blue , dotted],@xmath136  tev [ green , full ] . ]",
    "one finds , that the loop effects always reduce the overall enhancement of the higgs mass by 2530% .",
    "the radiative corrections are usually more important for small @xmath29 , but also depend to some extent on the hierarchy between @xmath131 and @xmath54 : for larger @xmath54 , which corresponds to a large enhancement at tree - level , the relative importance of the loops decreases faster with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "we have revisited here the possibility to push the tree - level mass of the sm - like higgs by non - decoupling @xmath2-terms .",
    "it has been shown that a pure study at tree - level can overestimate the positive effect on the higgs mass significantly .",
    "namely , new radiative corrections triggered by the extended gauge sector can reduce the higgs mass by several gev .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that gauge kinetic mixing , which is a natural effect if the new abelian gauge group is not orthogonal to @xmath137 , reduces the positive shift of the higgs mass at tree - level to some extent depending on the assumed cut - off scale @xmath88 .",

    "<S> non - decoupling d - terms are an attractive possibility to enhance the tree - level mass of the standard model like higgs boson in supersymmetric models . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss here for the case of a new abelian gauge group two effects usually neglected in literature : ( i ) the size of the additional radiative corrections to the higgs mass due to the presence of the new gauge coupling , and ( ii ) the impact of gauge kinetic mixing . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that both effects reduce to some extent the positive effect of the non - decoupling d - terms on the higgs mass .    </S>",
