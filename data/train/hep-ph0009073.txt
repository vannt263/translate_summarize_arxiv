    "the complex matrix @xmath40 is a non - linear representation of the pseudoscalar meson nonet .",
    "the conventions and definitions we use are the same as those in  @xcite .",
    "the method we use is the @xmath1 expansion @xcite . in this approach",
    ", we expand the matrix elements in powers of the momenta and of @xmath1 . for the @xmath1 corrections we calculated chiral loops as described in refs .",
    "especially important to this analysis are the non - factorizable corrections , which are uv divergent and must be matched to the short - distance part .",
    "they are regularized by a finite cutoff @xmath41 which is identified with the short - distance renormalization scale .",
    "the definition of the momenta in the loop diagrams , which are not momentum translation invariant , is discussed in detail in ref .",

    "the absence of any reference to the renormalization scheme in the low - energy calculation , at this stage , prevents a complete matching at the next - to - leading order @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a comparison of the numerical results obtained from the lo and nlo coefficients is useful as regards estimating the uncertainties and testing the validity of perturbation theory .",
    "as it is well known the large-@xmath27 approximation fails completely in explaining the @xmath42 rule . by taking the large-@xmath27 values for the two dominant operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 one obtains a @xmath3 cp - conserving amplitude which underestimates the data by roughly a factor of three .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath43 show an important specificity ; they are expected to be largely affected by non - chirally suppressed corrections beyond the large-@xmath27 limit . in the counting in @xmath44 and @xmath1 ,",
    "this property is attributed to the fact that the tree level mesonic representation of @xmath43 from the leading @xmath45 chiral lagrangian introduces @xmath45 terms with two derivatives . as a result",
    "the one - loop contributions over these terms , which are @xmath46 , are quadratically divergent , i.e.   possibly very large because these corrections are not protected by any symmetry like the chiral one . calculating the terms of @xmath46",
    "one obtains a large enhancement of the @xmath42 amplitude @xcite in the range required to reproduce the experiment @xcite .",
    "this illustrates how important are the non - chirally suppressed @xmath1 corrections for an understanding of the @xmath29 amplitudes .    in this context , for @xmath0",
    ", it is very important to investigate the counting in @xmath44 and @xmath1 for the dominant operators @xmath47 and to compare it with the one for @xmath43 . for @xmath48 the mesonic representation from the @xmath45 lagrangian is @xmath49 and does not have any derivative ( because @xmath48 is a density - density operator whereas @xmath43 are of the current - current type ) . as a result",
    "we do not expect any quadratic term but only chirally suppressed logarithmic or finite terms .",
    "the large-@xmath27 limit , @xmath50 , is therefore expected to be a much better approximation than for @xmath43 .",
    "different is the case of @xmath2 due to the fact that there is no tree level contribution from the leading @xmath45 lagrangian , and the large-@xmath27 value @xmath51 refers to the tree level contribution from the @xmath28 lagrangian which , as for @xmath43 , carries two derivatives [ i.e.  is @xmath45 ] .",
    "therefore , as for @xmath43 , we expect the large-@xmath27 value of @xmath53 to be affected by large @xmath46 corrections [ @xmath54 resulting from the loops over the @xmath45 tree operator .",
    "this shows clearly that , in the same way as for the @xmath55 rule , no clear statement can be done on the expected size of @xmath0 without calculating these @xmath1 non - factorizable corrections .",
    "analytical formulas for all matrix elements , at next - to - leading order in the twofold expansion in powers of momenta and of @xmath1 , are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the pseudoscalar approximation",
    ", the matching has to be done below 1gev . varying @xmath41 between 600 and 900mev , the bag factors @xmath56 and @xmath57 take the values @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; quadratic terms in @xmath60 and @xmath61 produce a large enhancement which brings the @xmath3 amplitude in agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "corrections beyond the chiral limit were found to be small .    for @xmath22 and @xmath23 the leading non - factorizable loop corrections , which are of @xmath62 , are only logarithmically divergent @xcite .",
    "including terms of @xmath49 , @xmath45 , and @xmath62 , @xmath53 and @xmath63 take the values @xmath64 and @xmath65 . as a result , as with large-@xmath27 values , @xmath0 is obtained generally much smaller than the data , except for input parameters taken close to the extreme of the ranges we considered . however , as stated above , since the leading @xmath49 contribution vanishes for @xmath2 , corrections from higher order terms beyond the @xmath45 and @xmath62 are expected to be large . in ref .  @xcite we investigated the @xmath46 contribution , i.e. , the @xmath1 correction at the next order in the chiral expansion , because it brings about , for the first time , quadratic corrections on the cutoff . from counting arguments and more generally from the fact that the chiral limit is assumed to be reliable ,",
    "the quadratic terms ( which are not chirally suppressed ) are expected to be dominant .",
    "it is still desirable to check that explicitly by calculating the corrections beyond the chiral limit , from logarithms and finite terms , as done for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "numerically , we observe a large positive correction from the quadratic term in @xmath22 .",
    "this point was already emphasized in ref .",
    "the slope of the correction is qualitatively consistent and welcome since it compensates for the logarithmic decrease at @xmath62 .",
    "varying @xmath41 between 600 and 900mev , the @xmath53 factor takes the values @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath2 is a @xmath3 operator , and the enhancement of @xmath22 indicates that at the level of the @xmath1 corrections the dynamics of the @xmath3 rule applies to @xmath2 as to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the size of the enhancement for @xmath53 appears however to be smaller for @xmath2 than for @xmath43 due to a smaller coefficient of the quadratic term .",
    "this coefficient is nevertheless large enough to increase @xmath0 by almost a factor of two .    using the quoted values for @xmath53 together with the full leading plus next - to - leading order @xmath67 factors for the remaining operators @xcite the results we obtain for @xmath0",

    "more accurate information on the parameters , from theory and experiment , will restrict the values for @xmath0 .    to estimate the uncertainties due to higher order final state interactions we also calculated @xmath0 using the real part of the matrix elements and the phenomenological values of the phases @xcite , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , i.e. , we replaced @xmath77 in eq .",

    "<S> we present a recent analysis of @xmath0 in the @xmath1 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the @xmath1 corrections to the matrix element of @xmath2 are large and positive , indicating a @xmath3 enhancement similar to the one of @xmath4 and @xmath5 which dominate the cp conserving amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this enhances the cp ratio and can bring the standard model prediction close to the measured value for central values of the parameters . </S>",
