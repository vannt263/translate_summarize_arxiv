    "the random field ising model ( rfim ) has been investigated extensively both theoretically and experimentally in last years.@xcite @xmath0 @xcite some questions such as the lower critical dimension and the existence of a static phase transition have been already solved from the theoretical point of view , but others questions as the existence of the tricritical point are still open .",
    "however , it is now understood that rfim describes the essential physics of a rich class of experimentally accessible disordered systems .",
    "these include structural phase transitions in random alloys , commensurate charge - density - wave systems with impurity pinning , binary fluid mixtures in random porous media , and the melting of intercalates i m layered compounds such as tis@xmath1 .",
    "the behavior of the rfim is governed by the competing tendencies of the spins to align ferromagnetically under impetus of the exchange or to follow local fields and so be uncorrelated .",
    "the rfim has been studied with different methods .",
    "the renormalization - group theory ( rg ) of phase transition and critical phenomena represent one of most powerful tool of theoretical physics in last decades .",
    "until then ( early 1970s ) all calculations of critical exponents were made either by exactly or by series expansions .",
    "therefore , employing the renormalization - group arguments ( which can be applied for weak fields ) , the proof of the equivalence between an ising ferromagnet in a random field and a dilute antiferromagnet in a uniform field has been demonstrated .",
    "these question have been very explored ( see [ figueiredo ] and references therein ) .    in the rg scheme , such as , the effective field rg ( efrg)@xcite@xmath2 @xcite and the mean - field rg ( mfrg ) @xcite@xmath2 @xcite methods have been successfully employed in spin systems , where the results obtained are in accordance with other more effective approach ( series expansion , monte carlo simulation among others ) . those approaches ( mfrg and efrg )",
    "are based on comparison of two clusters of different sizes , each of them simulating infinite systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean field approximation ( mfa ) has been extensively applied in the study of rfim .",
    "the mfa provides very interesting results about rfim .",
    "for example , a bimodal distribution for random field gives rise to a tricritical point and consequently first order phase transitions , at very low temperatures for certain values of field strength , but does not occur in the case of a gaussian distribution.@xcite@xmath0@xcite in addition , it is possible to establish a complete mapping between the parameters of the ising ferromagnet in a random field and the dilute ising antiferromagnet in a uniform field .    by employing the same strategy of efrg ,",
    "the effective field theory ( eft ) has been used to study cooperative phenomena and phase transitions in various systems and giving useful qualitative and quantitative insights for the critical behavior of a wide variety of classical and quantum lattice spin systems.@xcite@xmath0@xcite the approach of eft uses , as a starting point , the rigorous callen - suzuki spin identities ( see refs .  [ calen63 ] and  [ susuki65 ] ) and the effects of the surrounding spins on each cluster are taken into account by using a convenient differential operator technique introduced by honmura and kaneyoshi.@xcite in this procedure , all relevant self - spin correlations are taken exactly into account in the eft equation of state.@xcite therefore , the eft approach is superior to the standard mfa .    in this work ,",
    "we study the behavior of phase diagram ( in @xmath3 plane ) for heisenberg classical model of spin-1/2 on a square and simple cubic lattice by employing a bimodal probability distribution for random fields in a cluster with two spins by using the result recently obtained on diluted systems.@xcite the outline of the remainder of this paper is as following : in section * 1 * , the formalism and calculations are developed and the results and conclusions are presented in section * 2*.",
    "the system to be studied is the @xmath4-vectorial model in a random field described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where the summation is performed over all pairs of the nearest - neighboring sites @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath11 [ @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant and t the temperature ] is the exchange interaction between the spins , @xmath14 [ @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the bohr magneton and @xmath17 is the random magnetic field ] is the reduced random magnetic field at site @xmath9 with probability distribution @xmath18 .",

    "we follow the eft procedure ( see ref . [ rica_a ] ) to study the critical properties of the hamiltonian described by eq.([eq1 ] ) by employing the axial approximation.@xcite since the hamiltonian for a cluster with two spins can be written as    @xmath22    where @xmath23 , ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 is the lattice coordination number.the average magnetization per - spin @xmath26 for cluster with two spins is given by ( see refs .",

    "( [ meq2 ] ) is exact and will be applied here as a basis of our formalism , since it yields the cluster magnetization @xmath39 and the corresponding multi - spin correlation functions associated with various sites for the cluster under consideration . here",
    "we apply the eft approximation in both sides of eq .",
    "( [ meq2 ] ) , i.e. , the thermal and random average ( denoted by @xmath40 ) , along with the decoupling procedure which ignores all high - order spin correlations , namely @xmath41 , with @xmath42 based on this approximation and replacing each boundary configurational spin average by the symmetry breaking mean - field parameters @xmath43 for all @xmath9 , one set up the equation of state for @xmath44 . by using the properties of differential operator and assuming translational invariance , we obtain for the square ( sq ) and simple cubic lattice ( sc ) , respectivelly ,    @xmath45    the coefficients @xmath46 [ @xmath47 even ] are zero to satisfy the time reversal symmetry of the ising model , as well the properties of differential operator technique .",
    "in this section we apply the conditions for determining of the second - order transition line and the tricritical point ( tcp ) in the @xmath48 vector model in a random field .",
    "we will focus on the case @xmath49 , which corresponds to the heisenberg classical model of spin-@xmath50 . in the vicinity of the second - order phase transition , the eqs .",
    "( [ meq3 ] - [ meq3a ] ) is given by @xmath51 since the magnetization ( @xmath52 ) goes to zero continuously , to obtain the second order phase transition line , in the @xmath3 plane , we need solve the equations @xmath53 on the other hand , the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ meq5 ] ) must be positive ; otherwise , the transition is interpreted to be of first - order .",
    "unfortunately the first order transition line can not to be analyzed in the frame of the differential operator technique , therefore we have confined our calculations only to the second order transitions , including the tcp .",
    "we obtain the tcp by solving the equations @xmath54    the numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ meq4 ] ) provide the second - order phase transition line which is shown in figure 1 .",
    "when the random field is zero , we obtain the well - known critical temperature of heisenberg classical model of spin-@xmath50 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in figure 1 , the solid line indicate the second - order phase transitions ; the black diamonds denote the position of the tcp at which phase transition changes from second to first order .",
    "the numerical solution of equations ( [ meq6 ] ) provide the values for the tricritical points @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the square and simple cubic lattice , respectivelly .",
    "we might conclude saying that eft approximation is able to predict the presence of tricritical behavior for the heisenberg classical model of spin-@xmath50 on a square and simple cubic lattice in a random magnetic field which takes on the random values @xmath59 with equal probabilities . as can be seen ,",
    "our results show the existence of the tcp for square lattice ( @xmath60 ) in accordance with mean - field@xcite and betthe - peierls@xcite approximations .",
    "this occur because to obtain the first - order phase transition we must have at least the @xmath61 term in the expansion of eqs.([meq3 ] - [ meq3a ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the presente approach we can not observe behavior tricritical for lattice with coordination numbers @xmath62 ."
