    "generation of thermal states by doubling the degrees of freedom in a hilbert space accompanied by the action of a temperature dependent bogoliubov transformation , thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) @xcite , is a natural approach for dealing with finite temperature quantum states in a purified version of usual density operator formalism in a finite temperature scenario .",

    "requires implementation of gate operations , incorporating transmission and state manipulation in a complete quantum computational scheme .",
    "one important role is represented by the quantum teleportation ( qt ) , that dates back to aharonov and albert s result , in which nonlocality in a quantum system can be measured without violating causality @xcite , the no - cloning theorem @xcite and the famous propose by bennett et al.@xcite describing a protocol for the transmission over spatial distances with reconstruction of a quantum state , followed by an avalanche of other important theoretical proposes and experimental realizations ( see for instance  @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the route for large scale quantum communication has been started with photonic and ionic single qubits , polarized states of at least two - photons  @xcite , increasing the range of fidelities above 0.8 , covering distances above @xmath1 140 km  @xcite and minimizing loss effects during transmission  @xcite . a fundamental link to quantum computation",
    "was establised by gottesman and chuang proving that qt can be used as a universal primitive , reducing resource requirements for quantum computers and unifying known protocols for fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "bit - encondings using thermal logical bits , with proposes in thermal logical gates and thermal transistors @xcite , reinforce the fact that the thermal properties can be used as a resource for transmission of information and computation .",

    "<S> thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) approach is a real time quantum field method for dealing with finite temperature quantum states in a purified version of usual density operator formalism at finite temperature . in the domain of quantum information </S>",
    "<S> , tfd represents a quite promising direction for dealing with qubits under thermal influence and can also be associated to gaussian states . here , we propose a generalized tfd mean expectation for the case of thermofield qubits considering the action of gate operators . </S>",
    "<S> we propose quantum teleportation protocols involving thermofield states , considering thermal - to - thermal and thermal - to - non - thermal transfering cases . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we discuss the case in which alice and bob are at different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> action of gate operators on the result of the mandel parameter for thermofields and on gibbs - like density operators are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the no - cloning and non - broadcasting theorems in tfd are also considered and cases of superposed thermofield states and maps connecting thermofield vacua at different temperatures are also addressed and associated to metastable and non - equilibrium scenarios .    </S>",
