    "kepler s laws best describe the dynamics of our planetary system as regards to the orbital motion",
    ". however , newton s law of gravitation provided the theoretical framework of these laws . in central potential the orbital angular momentum is conserved . in polar coordinates ,",
    "the gravitational force consists of the ordinary attraction gravitational force and a repulsive centripetal force .",
    "the newton s law of gravitation has been successful in many respect",
    ". however , this law fails to account for very minute gravitational effect like deflection of light by an intervening star , precession of the perihelion of the planetary orbit and the gravitational red - shift of light passing a differential gravitational potential .",
    "einstein s general theory of gravitation generalizes newton s theory of gravitational to give a full account for all these observed gravitational phenomena .",
    "einstein treats these phenomena as arising from the curvature of space .",
    "hence , einstein s theory has become now the only accepted theory of gravitation .",
    "the inclusion of energy and momentum of matter ( mass ) in question leads to the curvature of space , while the inclusion of spin leads to torsion in space .",
    "einstein s theory deals with matter of the former case , while einstein - cartan deals with the latter case .",
    "thus , einstein space if torsion free . in classical electrodynamics",
    "the spin of a particle is a quantum effect with no classical analogue .",
    "however , the spin of a gravitating object ( e.g. , planets ) is defined as a rotation of an object relative to its center of mass .",
    "this is expressed as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the moment of inertia and angular velocity of the rotating object , respectively .",
    "the spin is generally a conserved quantity in physics . besides the spin , an object ( @xmath5 ) revolving at a distant @xmath17 around a central mass ( @xmath4 ) with speed @xmath8 is described by its orbital angular momentum .",
    "this is defined as @xmath18 .",
    "this quantity is also conserved , except when an external torque is acting on the object . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the spin and angular momentum of a fundamental particle are quantized .",
    "no such quantization is deemed to exist in gravitation . to incorporate quantum mechanics in gravitation we invoke a planck - like constant characterizing every gravitational system [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "this would facilitate a bridging to quantum gravity that has not yet been uniquely formulated so far .",
    "the spin and orbital angular momentum may couple to each other as the case in the earth - moon system .",
    "therefore , neither the spin nor the orbital angular momentum are separately conserved .",
    "their sum is always conserved .",
    "a similar coupling occurs in atomic system .",
    "for instance , because of the spin of the electron such effect is found to be present in hydrogen - like atoms .    owing to the existing similarities between gravitation and electromagnetism ,",
    "some analogies were drawn which led to gravitomagnetism paradigm .",
    "it is believed that an effect occurring in electromagnetism will have its counter analogue in gravitomagnetism .    in this paper",
    "we formulate the proper spin - orbit coupling in a gravitational system , and then deduce a formula for the spin of a gravitating object .",
    "this is done by equating the spin - orbit coupling energy to the gravitomagnetic energy .",
    "the resulting equation relates the spin of a gravitating object to its orbital angular momentum . while in standard gravitomagnetism , the gravitational spin - orbit coupling , @xmath2 , in our model of gravitomagnetism one has @xmath3 .",
    "this relation suggests a balance equation , @xmath19 .",
    "for this reason any orbiting object must spin in order to be dynamically stable .",
    "so planets during their course of evolution exchange @xmath1 and @xmath0 , but eventually come to a state of stability .",
    "the bigger the planet the larger its spin .",
    "hence , jupiter spins faster than other planets in the solar system .",
    "equivalently , the spin @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath8 is the orbital velocity .",
    "this formula is found to be consistent when applied to our planetary system and exoplanetary system .",
    "astronomers have discovered so far more than 800 new giants planets , but could nt identify all of their radii and spin periods .",
    "the present formulation helps identify these latter properties .",
    "we consider here all possibilities to account for the observationally derived data pertaining to the exoplanetary system and their consistency .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction resulting from an interaction of the electron spin with the magnetic field arising from electron motion in hydrogen - like atom is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the atomic number , @xmath25 is the coulomb constant , @xmath5 is the electron mass , @xmath26 is the speed of light , @xmath17 is the radial distance of the electron from the nucleus , and @xmath27 is the gyromagnetic ratio .    in gravitomagnetism theory , we have shown that [ 3 ] , @xmath28 @xmath29 is the gravitational gyromagnetic ratio , which corresponds to a gravitomagnetic energy @xmath30 however , einstein s theory of gravitation employing schwartzchild metric shows that because of space curvature a term of @xmath31 appears in the total energy of the gravitating object .",
    "thus , eq.(3 ) and ( 4 ) are very close to each other .",
    "this minute difference between the two paradigms should be further explored .",
    "notice that the inclusion of energy momentum tensor in einstein relativity equations leads to the space curvature , whereas the inclusion of spin would lead to the space torsion .",
    "einstein s general relativity respects the former but not the latter case . while einstein attributed the precession of planets to the curvature of space ,",
    "we ascribe it to the interaction of the spin of planets with the gravitomagnetic field induced by the sun in the planet frame of reference .    assuming the spin - orbit coupling as the one responsible for precession of perihelion of planetary orbits , the spin of a planet of mass @xmath5 orbiting a star of mass @xmath32",
    "can be obtained by equating eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) , _ i.e. _ , spin - orbit interaction energy equals to gravitomagnetic energy , which yields @xmath33 where @xmath1 is the orbital angular momentum of the orbiting planet is perpendicular to the ecliptic . ] , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the angle between @xmath1 and @xmath0 directions , and @xmath36 is the total mass of the system ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "however , the orbital plane of most planets is inclined to their ecliptic with an angle ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we have to decompose @xmath1 along the direction that is perpendicular to the ecliptic ( our reference plane ) , hence @xmath38 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore , eq.(5 ) becomes @xmath39 equation ( 6 ) indicates that for a system of particles each having a mass @xmath40 , and an angular momentum @xmath41 , the the center of mass of the angular momentum is @xmath42 so that the spin could be related to a center of mass of the angular momenta of the system .",
    "owing to the apparent analogy between electromagnetism and gravitomagnetism , one has @xmath43 so that eq.(1 ) would become @xmath44 where @xmath45 is gravitational gyromagnetic ratio analogue .",
    "it is not known whether @xmath46 or not . according to the standard theory of gravitomagnetism",
    ", we can equate eqs.(4 ) and ( 9 ) to obtain @xmath47 for @xmath46 .",
    "this is however not correct for the planetary system .",
    "equation ( 9 ) agrees with eq.(2 ) only if @xmath48 .",
    "we remark that several authors have considered the gravitational spin - orbit coupling comparing it with the atomic analogue [ 4 , 5 ] .",
    "none of them have derived it from first principle , or equivalently did nt show how the gravitational spin magnetic moment is related to the spin .",
    "this is only done in our recent publication [ 3 ] .",
    "mashhoon proposed that the analogy between gravity and electromagnetism dictates that charge , @xmath49 .",
    "hence , he concluded that the gravitational magnetic moment due to spin is related to spin by @xmath50 [ 6 ] . in our gravitomagnetic theory , this is however related by the relation @xmath51 .    applying eq.(8 ) in eq.(3 ) dictates that the curvature term lead to a potential ( interaction ) energy in the atomic system @xmath52 therefore , one can write the total potential energy for an electron in hydrogen - like atoms in an electric space as @xmath53 comparing eqs.(1 ) and ( 10 ) reveals that @xmath54 for an atomic system .",
    "thus , with this understanding the space inside an atom is not flat space ( minkowskian ) , but follows schwarzschild pattern , where @xmath55 is the electrical schwarzschild radius .",
    "hence , the metric for a spherically symmetric distribution of nuclear matter can be written as @xmath56 one can then interpret the rutherford-@xmath57 deflection as a consequence of the electrical curvature inside the atom .",
    "this is tantamount to deflection of light by the sun curvature .",
    "the electric schwarzschild radius is equal to twice classical electron radius , @xmath58 .",
    "similarly , one would expect a photon to be electrically redshifted in an electrical potential of the nucleus by an amount , @xmath59 in hydrogen - like atoms .",
    "hence , in an analogous manner when light passe near a central charge it will experience a redshift . this can be written as , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is compton wavelength of the electron .",
    "now , when @xmath62 , then @xmath63 .",
    "this case represents a maximal ( quantum ) redshift .",
    "thus , owing to the one - to - one analogy between gravitation and electromagnetism , one can use einstein s general relativity to describe electromagnetic phenomena , and maxwell s equation to describe gravitational phenomena .",
    "the origin of spin of planets has not been known exactly .",
    "one can easily determine the orbital angular momentum of a planet .",
    "the spin of a planet however requires knowledge of the planet mass , radius , its rotation period and its mass distribution inside the planet .",
    "since some planets are solid ( rocky ) and other are gaseous , it is not easily to identify precisely their internal structure .",
    "the former ones have generally higher rotation rate than the latter . however , orbital periods of planets depend on their distance from the sun and the sun mass only .",
    "we provide here a formula for spin or rotational period from its orbital motion only . or equivalently",
    ", we relate the spin to the orbital angular momentum for the first time in history .",
    "equation ( 6 ) can be used to express the planetary spin as @xmath64 this is a very interesting and useful formula that can be used to calculate the spin of a planet without resort to its rotation period and its radius .",
    "delauney and flammarion related the spin period of a planet to a host of planetary physical characteristics concluding that there is a direct relationship between spin period and mean density [ 7 ] .",
    "furthermore , brosche noticed that some planets in a similar size range had spin angular momenta , @xmath0 , that were proportional to the squares of their masses , @xmath5 [ 7 , 8 ] @xmath65 equation ( 14 ) agree partially with eq.(13 ) . in rotational dynamics",
    "the spin of a rigid body ( planet ) is defined by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the coefficient of inertia , @xmath9 the planet s radius , and @xmath10 is the rotational period of the planet . equation ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) states that the radius of the planet is @xmath68 using eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 15 ) one can write @xmath69{0.00,0.00,1.00}{\\frac{d}{p}=\\frac{1}{c^2}\\,\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2\\frac{1}{\\mu}}\\,,\\qquad c=\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\,\\cos i\\sqrt{1-e^2}}{\\lambda\\,\\cos\\,\\theta}\\,\\right)^{1/2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath11 are , respectively , the orbital period and the semi - major axis of the orbiting planet . equation ( 17 ) can be written as @xmath69{0.00,0.00,1.00}{d=\\frac{1}{c^2}\\,\\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2}{gm}\\right)^{2/3}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\right)\\ , r^2\\,\\,p^{-1/3}\\,.}\\ ] ] an educated guess can relate @xmath57 to the ellipticity ( flattening / oblateness ) of the planet , or to the eccentricity of the orbit . if the value of @xmath57 is not universal for all planets , we suggest that it will depend on some geometrical factors related to a given planet",
    ". this particular relation will require more analysis that can be tackled in future work .",
    "using eq.(15 ) , the rotation spin rate can be written as @xmath71 equation ( 19 ) can be written as @xmath72 the radius of a planet that is tidally locked to its star , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath73 , is given by ( _ see eq._(17 ) ) @xmath69{1.00,0.00,0.00}{r_t = c\\,\\sqrt{\\mu}\\,\\,a}\\,\\,.\\ ] ] equation ( 18 ) can also be written as , for @xmath73 , @xmath69{1.00,0.00,0.00}{p_t^2=c^{-3}\\,\\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2}{gm}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\right)^{3/2}\\,r_t^3}\\,.\\ ] ] it is of prime interest to mention that a hypothetical satellite that had a circular orbit radius equals to the radius of the planet , @xmath9 , its orbital period @xmath70 is given by [ 7 ] @xmath74 flammarion calculated @xmath75 values for earth , jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune , by extrapolating kepler s harmonic law , as applied to their known satellites [ 7 ] .",
    "only some of these period are in agreement with observation .",
    "the radius of a black hole is related to its mass , @xmath5 , by @xmath76 therefore , the gravitational force for such a planet ( spinning black hole ) is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "this clearly shows that a spinning black hole will experience a huge gravitational force when orbits any central massive object .",
    "it is shown by [ 10 ] that the spin of black hole ( @xmath79 ) is given by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is some constant .",
    "this agrees with eq.(13 ) where @xmath8 replaces @xmath26 for a black hole .",
    "this force is maximum when the planet is tidally - locked to its star , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath73 .",
    "hence , one has @xmath82 this force is of the order of @xmath83 .",
    "it is however shown that the maximal force in nature is defined by @xmath84 [ 1 , 2 , 11 ] .",
    "it also represents the maximum self - gravitating mass .",
    "it is thus interesting to see that the gravitational force arising from this case is of the same order of this maximal force . for a black hole planet of radius @xmath85",
    "tidally - locked with a black hole star with radius @xmath86 , one has @xmath87 this is an interesting relation connecting the two radii of orbiting black that are tidally - locked to their semi major axis .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the existence of such a system awaits the future astronomical exploration .",
    "we consider here the planetary system , jupiter satellites , and saturn satellites .",
    "the constant @xmath88 is calculated using eq.(18 ) and tabulated in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "the average value of @xmath88 are 0.089 , 0.077 , and 0.068 , for jupiter satellites , saturn satellites , and planetary system , respectively .",
    "notice that for exoplanet and asteroids the constant @xmath88 takes the average values 7 and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "the higher values of @xmath88 for asteroids may be attributed to the uncertainty associated with the observational data related to them .",
    "table6 can be used to identify exoplanets that are tidally locked by comparing the values of @xmath88 , for a given system , with that of the moon . since our moon is tidally locked , and well - known , we can consider @xmath89 for tidally locked planets . with this value , we complete table 7 .",
    "assuming the exoplanetary system is similar to our planetary system , we suggest that @xmath90 , as evident from table 1 . with this value",
    "we calculate the day for some exoplanets as shown in table 7 .",
    "notice that mercury is very closed to tidally - locked system envisaged in tables 2 and 6 .",
    "einstein s general theory of relativity modifies the newton s law of gravitational by adding an extra term that einstein attributed to the space curvature .",
    "we have shown in this work that this term could also arise from the spin - orbit interaction of spinning gravitating ( planets ) objects with the gravitomagnetic field .",
    "this assumption yields spin values for the planetary systems that are in agreement with observations .",
    "the equations associated with spin are then used to identify and calculate the astronomical data related to the newly discovered planets ( exoplanets ) .",
