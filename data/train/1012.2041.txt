    "since the 1930 s , the linear rayleigh - ritz ( rr ) variational method  @xcite has been the primary tool for determining the low energy part of the spectrum of quantum systems . in this approach , the trial function is expanded into a finite set of basis functions , and the coefficients of the expansion are determined by the variational principle .",
    "the approximations provided by the eigenvalues of the rr matrix are upper bounds that approach the exact energies monotonically from above on increasing the number of included functions of the basis  @xcite .",
    "however , the matrix elements are given by integrals and the number of the basis functions required to obtain accurate results grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom , which renders the method computationally prohibitive for complex systems .",
    "there are basically two strategies to reduce the computational cost of the method : choosing the basis functions in a sophisticated way or using approximations in calculating the hamiltonian matrix elements . among various implementations of the first strategy",
    "the introduction of nonlinear parameters into the functions of the basis is one of the most effective  @xcite .",
    "the adjustable parameters may be fixed so as to improve the convergence for a particular state  @xcite or a group of states  @xcite .",
    "an example of the second strategy is the collocation method where the matrix elements are approximated by @xmath0point quadratures . the recently published paper on `` variational collocation for systems of coupled anharmonic oscillators ''  @xcite combines both strategies mentioned above , demonstrating that by introducing adjustable parameters the convergence of the collocation method may be improved .",
    "however , it should be remembered that in contrast to the rr method , the collocation method does not have a variational character .",
    "discretization in the collocation approach introduces approximation in the hamiltonian matrix , as a consequence of which the results do not represent upper bounds to the exact bound - state energies .",
    "introducing the adjustable parameters does not change this fact ; therefore the method proposed by amore and fernandez should be termed optimized rather than variational .",
    "to illustrate the similarities and differences between optimization in the rr and collocation methods , we consider the example of the pullen - edmonds hamiltonian @xmath1 that has been studied in ref .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 represents the coupling between the two degrees of freedom .",
    "amore and fernandez observed that introducing a rotation parameter , the convergence of the collocation method may be improved further . the optimal rotation angle has been found to be close to @xmath3 , which corresponds to the hamiltonian @xmath4 hamiltonians ( [ eq : hdim2 ] ) and ( [ eq : hdim2rot ] ) have the same spectrum but the speed of convergence of the collocation method turns to be considerably higher in case of the application to the rotated one ( [ eq : hdim2rot ] ) .",
    "below we consider the application of the rr method to both hamiltonians using basis functions @xmath5 constructed as tensor products of the functions @xmath6 from a basis in one - dimensional ( 1d ) space that depends on an arbitrary parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8th order approximations are obtained with the use of @xmath8 even - parity 1d functions , which corresponds to diagonalization of the rr matrix of dimension @xmath9 .",
    "optimization is performed by choosing the value of @xmath7 so as to make the trace of that matrix stationary at each order of approximation  @xcite . in our procedure , we take the advantage of symbolic calculation in the mathematica package by performing the numerical algebra exactly in terms of the ratio of integers , which allows determination of the eigenvalues to arbitrary accuracy .",
    "first we calculate the accurate values of ground - state energy of the coupled oscillators through the optimized rr method , using the basis of trigonometric functions @xmath10 , \\label{trig}\\ ] ] which are eigenfunctions of the infinite potential well of a half - width @xmath11 that is taken as a nonlinear parameter .",
    "the same basis has been used by amore and fernandez in their collocation approach  @xcite . in table",
    "@xmath12 , we compare the approximations to the ground - state energy @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hdim2 ] ) and ( [ eq : hdim2rot ] ) , respectively , for different values of @xmath8 . the optimal value of the nonlinear parameter @xmath15 that renders the trace of the given order rr matrix stationary is also shown .",
    "the underlined digits are those that coincide with the exact result .",
    "we observe that both the series of approximations converge monotonically from above to the exact value with increasing @xmath8 , but the convergence for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hdim2rot ] ) is much quicker .",
    "this is similarly true at other couplings as can be seen in table [ eq : tablcomp ] , where the results obtained with @xmath16 are compared for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "we conclude that the same rotation that speeds up the convergence of the collocation method improves also the convergence of the rr method .    [ !",
    ".rr approximations to the ground - state energy of hamiltonians ( [ eq : hdim2 ] ) and ( [ eq : hdim2rot ] ) with @xmath17 obtained using @xmath8 functions from the trigonometric basis with optimized quarter period @xmath15 .",
    "the underlined digits are those that coincide with the exact result . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we studied the convergence of the optimized rr method for the ground - state energy of the coupled anharmonic oscillators using two basis sets : trigonometric functions and harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions .",
    "the comparison of the effectiveness of the methods with that of the optimized collocation method  @xcite is summarized in figure [ eq : p_nr1 ] by plotting the precision achieved in the computation performed with mathematica ver .",
    "the precision calculated as a difference between the approximate and exact result @xmath18 is shown in a log - log plot as a function of cpu time .",
    "an important observation is that the rotation that has been shown to improve the convergence of the collocation method  @xcite accelerates also the convergence of both variants of the rr method .",
    "it is seen that far greater accuracy in the ground - state energy is obtained by using the rotated hamiltonian ( [ eq : hdim2rot ] ) than by increasing the size of the basis .",
    "the optimized rr method is more effective with the harmonic oscillator basis than with the trigonometric one , but in both cases the convergence is quicker than that of the optimized collocation approach .",
    "this is opposed to the common understanding that the computational cost of the collocation method is less then that of the rr method  @xcite .",
    "our results show that the rr method with an appropriately optimized basis offers a similar accuracy to the optimized collocation method with much lower computational cost .",
    "another important advantage of the rr method is its variational character , which allows us to state that the lower the achieved result , the closer it is to the exact one .",
    "discretization in the collocation approach facilitates calculation of the hamiltonian matrix but destroys the variational behavior . normally the monotonic convergence from above",
    "is recovered when the number of grid point is sufficiently large but this is not automatically granted .",
    "for instance we observe that the approximations obtained by the collocation method from the rotated hamiltonian ( [ eq : hdim2rot ] ) in table 4 of  @xcite are below the accurate ground - state energies (  @xcite and our table [ eq : tabocomp ] ) and they decrease with increasing @xmath8 , which suggests that they do not converge to the proper result .",
    "this is a warning that when using the collocation method one has to be very cautious about deriving accurate results .",
