    "to satisfy the increasingly higher data rate demands , visible light communication ( vlc ) has drawn tremendous interest from both industry and academia as a promising complement to traditional radio frequency communication ( rfc ) that suffers from spectrum saturation @xcite .",
    "the maturing of led manufacturing techniques during the recent decade largely boosts the trend of replacing traditional lighting systems with led alternatives for both indoor and outdoor illumination purposes , and the resulting infrastructures are ready for deployment of vlc .",
    "it is a low - cost technology where one can use the simple intensity modulation and direct detection ( im / dd ) techniques .",
    "in addition , one can enjoy a bunch of additional advantages such as eye - safety , high security and causing no electromagnetic inference .",
    "vlc is both unique from and similar to rfc . with regard to the uniqueness of vlc",
    ", it only allows positive and real signals to drive the leds as intensities ( a non - informative dc - bias is typically used ) ; its channel especially for indoor environment is much more slower varying than a rfc counterpart ; baseband waveforms modulates the leds directly instead of being up - converted first , etc . as for the similarity between vlc and rfc ,",
    "many existing rfc techniques can be applied , although possibly with non - straightforward modifications to vlc systems , e.g. optical multiple input multiple output ( o - mimo ) @xcite , optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( o - ofdm ) @xcite , and other advanced signal processing techniques @xcite .",
    "these ( and relevant ) works nicely take advantage of various diversities a vlc system provides , such as spatial diversity , frequency diversity , color diversity and adaptive dc - bias , to improve system performance .",
    "it is worth noting that the color diversity and adaptive dc - bias configuration are specific to vlc .",
    "the motivation behind this work is to exploit the benefits of various diversities jointly for a very power efficient vlc , while the focus of this paper is on the problem of constellation design in high dimensional space .",
    "this space is formed by several dimensions of freedoms including adaptive dc - bias , baseband subcarriers and multiple wavelengths corresponding to r / g / b led lights . according to the fundamental idea that spheres ( i.e. , constellation points ) can pack more compactly in a higher dimensional space",
    ", a constellation with larger minimum euclidean distance ( med ) can be expected in a higher dimensional space .. this med maximization problem is formulated in a non - convex optimization form , and is then relaxed to a convex optimization problem by a linear approximation method .",
    "key practical lighting requirements are taken into account as constraints , e.g. , the optical power constraint , average color constraint , non - negative intensity constraint , color rendering index ( cri ) and luminous efficacy rate ( ler ) requirements @xcite .        for rfc ,",
    "one well - known shortcoming with utilizing multiple subcarriers is the excessive peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) problem introduced , which can cause severe nonlinear distortion to degrade system performance .",
    "plenty of methods have been proposed to reduce papr ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , when using multiple subcarriers for vlc , high papr is also a very severe issue , due to the limited linear dynamic range of amplifiers and leds .",
    "this paper shows that such distortion can be avoided by formulating the dynamic range requirement as ( convex ) constraints of the optimization problem . in such way distortion control",
    "becomes a offline process or a by - product of constellation design .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we first provide an overview of dc - informative modulation schemes for optical communications .",
    "dc - informative multicarrier modulation is introduced as a power efficient alternative to traditional non - dc - informative optical ofdm configurations . in section iii",
    ", we propose the dci - jcfm method for systems with rgb led .",
    "the key lighting constraints including dynamic range control are discussed .",
    "the cases of `` balanced '' , `` unbalanced '' and `` very unbalanced '' systems are introduced . in section iv , we discuss the pros and cons of using dynamic range constraint , short time papr constraint and long time papr constraint . in section",
    "v , we provide simulation results to verify the significant performance gains of the proposed method over a decoupled method for balance , unbalance , and very unbalanced systems .",
    "finally , section vi provides conclusions .",
    "optical communications based on im / dd has a unique feature of requiring all signals modulating the leds to be positive ( and real ) , so multiple schemes are proposed accordingly such as the well - know asymmetrically clipped optical ofdm ( aco - ofdm ) , dc - biased optical ofdm ( dco - ofdm ) and optical multisubcarrier modulation ( msm ) .",
    "these schemes all discard the dc - bias at the receiver , which causes significant power loss .",
    "the dc - informative modulation schemes were then proposed such that @xmath0 optical power is used for data transmission ( see @xcite for single carrier case and @xcite for multiple carrier selective fading case ) . to be specific , consider the channel model @xmath1 , \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a symbol waveform mapped from @xmath3 that contains @xmath4 bits of information , @xmath5 denotes the convolution operator , @xmath6 is either flat - fading or selective - fading channel , @xmath7 denotes white noise , @xmath8 is the received signal , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are electrical - to - optical and optical - to - electrical conversion factors respectively , with out loss of generality ( w.o.l.g ) . ] and @xmath11 stands for the constellation size .",
    "the key feature of a dc - informative modulation is that the following basis are used _",
    "jointly _ to carry information @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 where both i and q channels are used .",
    "@xmath15 is the dc - bias basis , @xmath16 is the symbol interval , @xmath17 is the @xmath18-th subcarrier , @xmath19 is the total number of subcarriers , and a rectangular pulse - shaper is used @xmath20 the relationship between symbol waveforms @xmath2 and constellation points @xmath21 $ ] is @xmath22 and one of the reasonable goals is to minimize the ser subject to fixed electrical / optical power by properly design the constellation matrix @xmath23 where each column of @xmath24 is a constellation point , and the med of all columns should be maximized to reach the goal .",
    "we typically stack the columns into a single vector instead , i.e. @xmath25^t,\\ ] ] for simplification of the formulation of the optimization problem discussed in section ii .",
    "based on the idea discussed in section ii , we propose two constellation design methods taking advantage of the informative dc - bias for a visible light communication system employing one rgb led as shown by fig.1 . if the inputs into r / g / b carry independent bit information as shown by fig.1(a ) , it is termed a decoupled scheme . in comparison ,",
    "if the inputs into r / g / b modulators only carry information jointly , it is a joint scheme instead as shown by fig.1(b ) . in other words , although for a joint scheme still three modulators are used to create continuous domain waveforms to drive corresponding leds , information can not be estimated though recovery of a single ( or any pair ) of them .",
    "it is observed that the joint scheme may utilize four types of diversities during per channel use , including frequency diversity , color(wavelength ) diversity , adaptive dc , and spatial diversity .",
    "spatial diversity can be achieved by extending from employing only one rgb led to include @xmath26 ones , which is out of scope of this paper .",
    "we only emphasize the first three diversities here .",
    "this scheme is termed dc - informative joint color - frequency modulation ( dci - jcfm ) .",
    "the decoupled system shown in fig.1(a ) works as follows : at the transmitter - side three independent bit stream @xmath27~i\\in[1,n_c]$ ] , of length @xmath28 are mapped to corresponding constellation points @xmath29 of size @xmath30 first , which are modulated separately to generate continuous symbol waveform ( current ) @xmath31 by for each tunnel .",
    "if cross - talks exist for any tunnel , a corresponding precoder @xmath32 needs to be applied before modulation .",
    "waveforms @xmath31 are then electrical - to - optical converted to intensity signals @xmath33 to drive the leds . at the receiver - side ,",
    "photo detectors of each tunnel collect the waveforms ( convoluted with channel and corrupted by noise ) .",
    "the received signal is sent through red , green , and blue color filters respectively and after optical - to - electrical conversion waveforms @xmath34 are obtained .",
    "then @xmath35 matched filters are employed for each tunnel to demodulate @xmath34 to obtain signal vector @xmath36 .",
    "three symbol detectors follow to provide @xmath37 , estimates of the symbol vectors , which are de - mapped separately and the estimate of original bit sequences @xmath38 are finally obtained .",
    "if cross - talks exist , post - equalizers @xmath39 are applied before the symbol detectors .",
    "system using dci - jcfm as shown by fig.1(b ) works differently . a joint bit sequence @xmath40^t,\\ ] ] is firstly mapped jointly to a constellation point @xmath41 of size @xmath42 .",
    "then @xmath41 is converted by a joint modulator to the continuous domain to obtain @xmath43 through @xmath44 if cross - talks exist , a joint precoder @xmath45 is applied before modulation .",
    "also we observe the expectation of @xmath46 as follows @xmath47&=\\sum_{p=1}^3 s_{(p-1)(2k+1)+1,i}\\phi_1(t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since all non - dc basis has zero time averages .",
    "therefore , both the average optical power and average color of system are determined solely by these three adaptive dc - bias . while the dynamic range of waveform , instead , is influenced by all subcarriers of all leds .    for our design",
    ", we will demonstrate with a line - of - sight ( los ) scenario when channel has cross - talks , due to the imperfectness of receiver color filters .",
    "the discrete channel model can be written as follows @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 $ ] is termed the `` cross - talk index ( ci ) '' and @xmath50 .      with working snrs for vlc which are typically medium - to - high , the minimum euclidean distance between constellation pairs governs ser .",
    "therefore , we seek to minimize the system ser by maximizing the minimum euclidean distance , through carefully design the constellation vector @xmath51 subject to key lighting constraints . for a constellation containing @xmath52 points , distances of a total of @xmath53 pairs have to be constrained as follows @xcite @xmath54 where we define @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes kronecker product , @xmath58 is the @xmath59-th column of identity matrix @xmath60 , and @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "the distance constraints are nonconvex in @xmath51 .",
    "we choose to use the follows linear approximation at point @xmath63 @xmath64      for our design problem , practical lighting issue considered include average optical power , average illumination color , ler and cri , non - negative intensity , and flickering - free requirements .",
    "the first three requirements can be constraint using only one equation written as follow @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the average optical power of a rgb led , @xmath67 is a selection matrix ( containing only ones and zeros ) adding up r / g / b components in @xmath51 respectively by a multiplication of each row with it , @xmath68^t$ ] is termed the average color ratio vector and the follow equation holds @xmath69 thus the optical power and illumination color requirements are constrained together .",
    "the luminous efficacy rate and color rendering index requirements can be satisfied by properly choosing @xmath70 .      since the linear dynamic range of leds",
    "are limited , the ranges of signal for each led have to be constrained to avoid nonlinear distortion , i.e. @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the highest current level and for simplicity we have assumed that red , green and blue leds have the same dynamic range .",
    "we propose to constrain dynamic range of a sequence of sampled signal @xmath73 and @xmath74 is picked as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the oversampling rate , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the total number of sample points .",
    "it should be noted that although does not guarantee , which means the continuous signal waveforms designed subject to could result in negative amplitudes in between the sample instances , the negative peak is very small compare to the dynamic range of signal .",
    "we can compensate this effect by adding a small post dc - bias after obtaining an optimized constellation .",
    "therefore , we can formulate this point - wise dynamic range constraints as follows    @xmath79    @xmath80    where @xmath81 selects the @xmath82-th constellation point and @xmath83 selects the corresponding coefficients for color @xmath84 , @xmath85^t$ ] , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .      we first formulate the optimization problem when there is no cross - talks among different colored leds , i.e. @xmath89 , as follows    @xmath90    which is convex in @xmath51 and @xmath91 , and specialized solver such as cvx toolbox for matlab can be utilized @xcite .",
    "start from initial point @xmath63 , the scheme can iteratively converge to a local optima with each run .",
    "the best constellation is chosen from local optimal constellation obtained from multiple runs .",
    "when the channel suffers from cross - talks , we choose to deal with it by employing the well - known singular value decomposition ( svd ) based pre - equalizer @xmath92 and post - equalizer @xmath93 for our system , where @xmath94 .",
    "constellation is designed by an optimization with transformed constraints as follow    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is defined is the kronecker product . ] and apparently this optimization is convex as well .    for the decoupled system ,",
    "three independent problems can be formulated to find the meds for each color , i.e.    @xmath97    where @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 are defined in a similar manner with corresponding parameters in .",
    "for brevity we omit the explicit definitions .",
    "in fact , although a hard constraint on the dynamic range of symbol waveforms can help avoid non - linear distortion completely , it may bring with side effects such as excessive power efficiency decrease .",
    "this is particularly true if only one or few symbol waveforms have notably larger dynamic range than the majority . in such case",
    ", one can consider using certain papr constraint to replace the dynamic range constraint .",
    "in other words , there is a tradeoff between allowable papr and power efficiency .",
    "two types of papr constraints ( for each led light ) can be considered .",
    "one is the so - called long - term papr ( l - papr ) , i.e. the ratio of the peak power of all waveforms and the time average of them . assuming no cross - talks , the l - papr constraint for led @xmath84",
    "can be written as @xmath104 ^ 2 } { \\mathbf{s}_j^t\\mathbf{s}_j / n_c}\\leq \\beta_x\\notag\\\\ & = \\frac{n_c[\\max_{i , n}(\\mathbf{u}_n^t\\mathbf{k}_x\\mathbf{j}_i\\mathbf{s}_j)]^2 } { \\mathbf{s}_j^t\\mathbf{s}_j}\\leq\\beta_x,\\label{27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the required l - papr for led @xmath84 .",
    "thus , a set of constraints can be formulated as follows @xmath106 which is non - convex in @xmath51 .",
    "a way to deal with this is to use a similar linear approximation as in at the same initial point @xmath63 .",
    "the above constraints are thus transformed as follows @xmath107    the other is the individual papr ( i - papr ) , i.e. the ratio of the peak power of each waveform and the average power of it .",
    "the i - papr for @xmath82-th waveform for led @xmath84 can be written as @xmath108 ^ 2 } { \\mathbf{s}_j^t\\mathbf{j}_i^t\\mathbf{j}_i\\mathbf{s}_j}\\leq \\beta_{x , i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the corresponding constraint can be written as @xmath109 and a similar linear approximation process is applied to convert them to convex constraints .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , there is no comprehensive comparison on performance of systems applying those three constraints available so far .",
    "an interesting observation recently in @xcite shows that the non - linearity mitigation for an im / dd vlc is a more involved problem than expected .",
    "the reason is that the low part of the baseband frequencies are causing larger non - linear distortion than the higher part .",
    "this effect , if taken into account along with the three constraints discussed above , is expected to make the design problem even more worthwhile to look into .",
    "in this section , we compare the performances of the decoupled scheme and dci - jcfm by assessing the maximum med and bit error rate ( ber ) under different channel cross - talk and color illumination assumptions . each constellation point",
    "is assumed to have equal probability of transmission , and the union bound for ser of both the scheme can be written as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.25 ) @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the number of neighbor constellation pairs @xcite and @xmath112 denotes the gaussian q - function , @xmath113}$ ] stands for the med of the dci - jcfm and meds for decoupled schemes .",
    "the bit error rate is thus calculated as @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the number of wrongly detected bits in each bit sequence , which can be minimized by employing the bsa mapper .",
    "we first compare the dci - jcfm and the decoupled scheme when channel cross - talks do not exist . to guarantee a fair comparison ,",
    "the following system parameters are chosen : the number of monte - carlo runs for each scheme @xmath116 , the length of bit sequence for each channel use is @xmath117 for dci - jcfm and @xmath118 respectively for each tunnel of the decoupled system , the number of subcarriers for each led is @xmath119 , the average optical power @xmath120 , the symbol interval @xmath121 is used is chosen , since the design is rate independent . ] , the upper bound of waveform amplitude @xmath122 , the average color ratio vector for a balanced system @xmath123^t,\\ ] ] for an unbalanced system @xmath124^t,\\ ] ] and for a very unbalanced system @xmath125^t.\\ ] ]    the meds of the two schemes for three systems obtained through picking the best constellatio from the @xmath126 local optimums are summarized by table i.    from table i , key observations include : a. with the dci - jcfm , the `` joint med '' is much larger than the r / g / b `` decoupled meds '' , except for the cases with very unbalanced illumination . while for the very unbalanced case the blue and green tunnels could suffer from severe performance loss with the small meds , and therefore the dci - jcfm is still expected to work better .",
    "b. larger meds are obtained with an increased number of subcarriers .",
