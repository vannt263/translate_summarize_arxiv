    "bilayer graphene has attracted considerable attention due to its unusual electronic properties and prospective applications in graphene - based spintronics@xcite .",
    "while the low - energy excitations in monolayer graphene are massless dirac fermions with linear dispersion and carry berry phase @xmath0@xcite , the chiral quasiparticles in bernal stacked bilayer graphene show finite mass with parabolic dispersion and carry a @xmath1 berry phase@xcite . for bilayer graphene at charge neutral point ,",
    "different to the gapless feature of single - particle excitations , theories@xcite recently predict some broken symmetry states due to strong electron - electron interactions , which are characterized by small finite gaps , supported by some recent experiments@xcite .    another strategy for achieving an interaction - induced gap for bilayer graphene is to construct a nanoribbon , especially with zigzag termination@xcite , where the gap opening is due to the interedge interactions between the spin polarizations of the localized edge states .",
    "the edge magnetism of zigzag - terminated graphene nanoribbon is of great interest for many scientists even though strong experimental evidence for its existence is still absent@xcite .",
    "according to the stoner criterion , at or near half - filing , the ground state has a ferromagnetic ( fm ) instability due to electron - electron interactions and will then lead to an antiferromagnetic ( af ) structure where each edge is ferromagnetically polarized but the edges are coupled with each other antiferromagnetically@xcite . in the low carrier doping regime , it was predicted that besides the collinear magnetic states , the monolayer zigzag graphene nanoribbon(mzgnr ) can have a noncollinear(nc ) magnetic ground state@xcite .",
    "bilayer zigzag graphene nanoribbons(bzgnrs ) under a bias voltage provide an additional way to tune the electronic properties of graphene - based spintronics@xcite , since charge transfer between the layers affects dramatically the bulk and edge states .",
    "thus the bilayer - graphene - ribbon - based electronic devices with the magnetic and transport properties tuned by an electric filed can be expected@xcite . to the best of our knowledge , previous works on the edge magnetism in bzgnr mainly focused on the undoped half - filling case and only the collinear spin polarizations were taken into account@xcite .",
    "therefore the possibility of stable nc magnetic states in a doped bzgnr becomes a natural question which deserves further investigations .",
    "on the other hand , under the application of a transverse field across a nanoribbon , transition between the semiconducting and half - metallic(hm ) states can be achieved by tuning the field strength in both mzgnr@xcite and bzgnr @xcite . for the mzgnr , in the absence of the inversion symmetry , which may be caused by the substrate",
    ", it is found that the hm states can be stabilized at both the charge neutrality point@xcite and finite doping@xcite . in analogy with mzgnr , half - metallicity",
    "can also be expected in a biased bzgnr due to the existence of edge states and their edge polarizations@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "based on the tight - binding model for a biased bzgnr and taking the coulomb interactions into account , we theoretically explore and classify all the possible magnetic states due to the couplings between edge polarizations and then investigate the possibility of the nc mangnetic states .",
    "we also search the possibility of the half - metallicity for all the magnetic phases .",
    "it is found that the nc states do exist and can be stabilized as metallic states in a lightly - doping and small - bias regime .",
    "several kinds of hm states are found , which are distinguished by their unique magnetic structures and quantized electric conductance along the ribbon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give the model hamiltonian and its mean - field treatment . in section 3",
    "we classify and discuss the magnetic structures of the ground states and then give the phase diagram . in section 4",
    "we investigate properties of the nc spin canted states and find out all the possible hm states . in section 5 , we summarize our results .",
    "different bzgnrs are distinguished by the interlayer stacking arrangements and the edge alignments . here",
    "we study the bernal stacked bzgnr with the @xmath2 alignment@xcite .",
    "it consists of two coupled graphene ribbon sheets , where the sublattice a sites of the upper layer are located exactly on the top of sublattice @xmath3 sites of the lower layer .",
    "we assume that the system is subjected to an external electric field between the layers .",
    "the model hamiltonian can be given as follows , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the intralayer nearest - neighbor hopping integral , and @xmath6 is the electron annihilation operator at site @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 denoting the upper and lower layers . in the second term ,",
    "the interlayer coupling @xmath10 is the hopping integral between the @xmath3 sites on the lower layer and their corresponding top @xmath11 sites on the top layer .",
    "@xmath12 is the on - site coulomb repulsion energy , and @xmath13 the electrostatic bias voltage .",
    "despite the fact that @xmath14 term breaks the inversion symmetry , the hamiltonian at half - filling is still kept invariant under a combination operation of _ pi _ , where _ p _ is the particle - hole transformation ( @xmath15 , with @xmath16 if @xmath17 belongs to a(b ) sublattice of the upper or lower layers ) and _ i _ the space inversion , with the inversion center chosen as the center of the bilayer zigzag ribbon .",
    "now that the possibility of the noncollinear spin polarization can not be excluded , the hubbard term is so decoupled that the mean - field hamiltonian can be written as ,    @xmath18    where the electron spin polarization and charge density are given by @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively , with @xmath21 the spin pauli matrices and @xmath22 .",

    "the ground state can be determined by finding out the lowest - energy one . in the following discussion",

    "both edges are spin polarized . when both the edge spin polarizations are fm(af ) , there are two kinds of collinear configurations(see fig .",
    "2](a)-(d ) ) , which are denoted by af - fm or fm - fm(af - af or fm - af ) , according to whether the coupling between the left and right edges on the same layers is af or fm .",
    "particularly , when both edges are spin af polarized , the interedge coupling is expected to be rather small for a relatively wide ribbon , leading to the nearly degenerate af - af and fm - af states@xcite",
    ". there also exists the possibility that the edges has different spin polarizations .",
    "the state denoted by figure  [ fig .",
    "2](m ) is called `` mixed '' , since it is spin fm polarized at the left edge but af polarized at the right one .",
    "these five states fall into the first category of the magnetic states . upon further doping at finite bias ,",
    "the right edge of the upper layer firstly becomes depolarized with the other spin polarizations qualitatively unchanged .",
    "these states are labeled by us by following the denotations of the states of the first category a symbol `` -ii '' .",
    "correspondingly four states(shown in figure  [ fig .",
    "2](e)-(h ) ) are found to be stabilized , and are classified as the second category .",
    "further doping and increasing @xmath14 will further depolarize the system .",
    "the third category consists of all the possible states with the upper layer fully spin depolarized . since in this category ,",
    "only the lower layer are spin polarized , analogously to mzgnr case , one can denote simply the magnetic states as af or fm(see figure  [ fig .",

    "these two states are denoted by fr and fl respectively .",
    "the fifth category consists of only one state(see figure  [ fig .",
    "2](n ) ) , which lies near @xmath52 at finite doping and is denoted by fm - ii , possessing the fm coupled edge polarizations located at the left edge of the upper layer and right edge of the lower layer .    at half - filling , these exist two magnetic phases where the af - fm phase is stabilized at lower @xmath14 while the fm - af one is stabilized instead at larger @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath14 is larger than the critical value @xmath53 , the bzgnr system will undergo a phase transition from the fm - af state to a paramagnetic(pm ) state . as mentioned before",
    ", the model hamiltonian at half - filling is invariant under _ pi_. it is found that all the above three states at half - filling preserve the _ pi _",
    "symmetry and so each of them has the following symmetry properties : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the electron densities and edge spin polarizations at the sites on the four edges of the two layers .",
    "symmetry is even preserved near the transition point between the af - fm and fm - af states , while it is completely lost when the system is away from half - filling ( see figure  [ fig .",
    "4 ] ) .    on the other hand",
    ", in the absence of a gate bias , i.e. , at @xmath52 , the model system is inversion symmetric , which means that the ground state might be invariant under inversion _",
    "i_. we find that upon increasing @xmath46 , the inversion symmetric and inversion asymmetric states occur alternatively .",
    "concretely , the ground state is found to be inversion symmetric for all the fm - fm states(@xmath57 ) and all the fm - ii states(@xmath58 ) at @xmath52 , while found to be inversion asymmetric otherwise .",
    "there exist a regime of symmetric nc canted states located at @xmath59 , which is @xmath60__i _ _ symmetric apart from a global spin rotation , with @xmath60 the mirror reflection with respect to the plane normal to the zigzag direction .",
    "all the above inversion symmetric collinear states satisfy :    @xmath61    while the symmetric coplanar nc states satisfy : @xmath62 where the relative angle between @xmath63 and @xmath64 varies from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "once @xmath67 , sufficient electrons will be transferred from the upper to the lower layer , making the upper layer a pm state without polarizations at both edges , regardless of the doping level . since the upper layer is fully depolarized ,",
    "the magnetism of the bzgnr is dominated by the lower layer and then the system can be viewed as one possessing approximate particle - hole symmetry at half - filling of the lower layer . as a consequence ,",
    "the magnetic states together with the pm ones are found to distribute nearly symmetrically about the half - filling line of the low layer(the dashed line in figure  [ fig .",
    "3 ] ) in the phase diagram .",
    "the other consequence is that starting from an af state , upon doping , the system undergoes transitions one by one to the fm , to the fr , and to the pm states respectively , analogous to that in mzgnr@xcite . furthermore , except for the nc canted states , all phases located at this dashed line , including the af , the af - fm - ii and the mixed states , have af couplings between the left and right edges on the lower layer , which is consistent with that in mzgnr@xcite .",
    "the topological structure of the phase diagram is nearly unchanged for different ribbon width @xmath36 as long as it is less than 20 . for a wider ribbon ,",
    "we note that since the interedge coupling is more negligible , especially for the case where one of the edges is spin af polarized@xcite , the fm - af and af - af states(or the fm - af - ii and af - af - ii states ) become competing and in certain regime of phase diagram , they are nearly degenerate .",

    "on the other hand , the left(right ) edge sites of the upper(lower ) layer are most easily spin polarized since they are actually the leftmost(rightmost ) sites of the bzgnr , which are closer to magnetic instability .    in analogy with mzgnr",

    ", we see that all the hm states form a connected regime below the half - filling line of the lower layer , indicating that the hm states only exist where the doping level of the lower layer is more than half - filling .",
    "we find seven kinds of the hm states in five magnetic phases(see figure  [ fig . 6 ] ) : the af - fm phase at finite doping is hm with a quantized electric conductance @xmath49 ; the fm - af phase is hm and has a quantized electric conductance @xmath49 at low doping but @xmath51 at larger doping .",

    "thus for a bzgnr at a fixed doping , one can achieve phase transitions between different hm states by tuning the bias voltage , which may have great applications in graphene manipulation .",
