    "algorithmic information theory ( ait , for short ) is a framework for applying information - theoretic and probabilistic ideas to computability theory .",
    "one of the primary concepts of ait is the _ program - size complexity _ ( or _ kolmogorov complexity _ ) @xmath6 of a finite binary string @xmath7 , which is defined as the length of the shortest binary program for a universal decoding algorithm @xmath8 , called an _ optimal prefix - free machine _ , to output @xmath7 . by the definition , @xmath6 is thought to represent the amount of randomness contained in a finite binary string @xmath7 . in particular , the notion of program - size complexity plays a crucial role in characterizing the _ randomness _ of an infinite binary sequence , or equivalently , a real . in @xcite chaitin",
    "introduced the @xmath9 number as a concrete example of random real .",
    "the first @xmath10 bits of the base - two expansion of @xmath9 solve the halting problem of @xmath8 for inputs of length at most @xmath10 . by this property , @xmath9 is shown to be a random real , and plays a central role in the development of ait .    in this paper , we study the _ statistical mechanical interpretation _ of ait . in a series of works @xcite",
    ", we introduced and developed this particular subject of ait .",
    "first , in @xcite we introduced the _ thermodynamic quantities _ at temperature @xmath1 , such as partition function @xmath3 , free energy @xmath11 , energy @xmath12 , statistical mechanical entropy @xmath13 , and specific heat @xmath14 , into ait .",
    "these quantities are real functions of a real argument @xmath0 , and are introduced in the following manner : let @xmath15 be a complete set of energy eigenstates of a quantum system and @xmath16 the energy of an energy eigenstate @xmath7 of the quantum system .",
    "in @xcite we introduced thermodynamic quantities into ait by performing replacements  [ cs06 ] below for the corresponding thermodynamic quantities in statistical mechanics .",
    "[ cs06 ]    1 .",
    "replace the complete set @xmath15 of energy eigenstates @xmath7 by the set @xmath17 of all programs @xmath18 for @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   replace the energy @xmath16 of an energy eigenstate @xmath7 by the length @xmath19 of a program @xmath18 .",
    "3 .   set the boltzmann constant @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "for example , in statistical mechanics , the partition function @xmath22 at temperature @xmath1 is given by @xmath23 + thus , based on replacements  [ cs06 ] , the partition function @xmath3 in ait is defined as @xmath24 + in general , the thermodynamic quantities in ait are variants of chaitin @xmath9 number . in fact , in the case of @xmath4 , @xmath25 is precisely chaitin @xmath9 number . in @xcite",
    "we then proved that if the temperature @xmath1 is a computable real with @xmath26 then , for each of the thermodynamic quantities @xmath3 , @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 in ait , the partial randomness of its value equals to @xmath1 , where the notion of _ partial randomness _ is a stronger representation of the compression rate by means of program - size complexity .",
    "thus , the temperature @xmath1 plays a role as the partial randomness ( and therefore the compression rate ) of all the thermodynamic quantities in the statistical mechanical interpretation of ait . in @xcite",
    "we further showed that the temperature @xmath1 plays a role as the partial randomness of the temperature @xmath1 itself , which is a thermodynamic quantity of itself in thermodynamics or statistical mechanics .",
    "namely , we proved the _",
    "fixed point theorem on partial randomness _ , which states that , for every @xmath27 , if the value of partition function @xmath3 at temperature @xmath1 is a computable real , then the partial randomness of @xmath1 equals to @xmath1 , and therefore the compression rate of @xmath1 equals to @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the first @xmath10 bits of the base - two expansion of the real @xmath1 . in our second work @xcite on the statistical mechanical interpretation of ait , we showed that a fixed point theorem of the same form as for @xmath3 holds also for each of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . in the third work @xcite",
    ", we further unlocked the properties of the fixed points on partial randomness by introducing the notion of composition of prefix - free machines into ait , which corresponds to the notion of composition of systems in normal statistical mechanics . in the work @xcite we developed a total statistical mechanical interpretation of ait which attains a perfect correspondence to normal statistical mechanics , by making an argument on the same level of mathematical strictness as normal statistical mechanics in physics .",
    "we did this by identifying a _ microcanonical ensemble _ in ait .",
    "this identification clarifies the meaning of the thermodynamic quantities of ait .",
    "our first work @xcite showed that the values of all the thermodynamic quantities in ait diverge when the temperature @xmath1 exceeds @xmath2 .",
    "this phenomenon might be regarded as some sort of _ phase transition _ in statistical mechanics . in the work",
    "@xcite we revealed a computational aspect of the phase transition in ait .",
    "the notion of _ weak truth - table reducibility _ plays an important role in recursion theory @xcite . in the work @xcite we introduced an elaboration of this notion , called _ reducibility in query size @xmath30_.",
    "this elaboration enables us to deal with the notion of asymptotic behavior of computation in a manner like in computational complexity theory , while staying in computability theory .",
    "we applied the elaboration to the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath17 , where the latter is the set of all halting inputs for the optimal prefix - free machine @xmath8 , i.e. , the _ halting problem_. we then revealed the critical difference of the behavior of @xmath3 between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in relation to @xmath17 .",
    "namely , we revealed the phase transition between the _ unidirectionality _ at @xmath4 and the _ bidirectionality _ at @xmath5 in the reduction between @xmath3 and @xmath17 .",
    "this critical phenomenon can not be captured by the original notion of weak truth - table reducibility .    in this paper",
    ", we reveal another computational aspect of the phase transition in ait between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we introduce the notion of _ strong predictability _ for an infinite binary sequence .",
    "let @xmath31 be an infinite binary sequence with each @xmath32 .",
    "the strong predictability of @xmath15 is the existence of the computational procedure which , given any prefix @xmath33 of @xmath15 , can predict the next bit @xmath34 in @xmath15 with unfailing accuracy , where the suspension of an individual prediction for the next bit is allowed to make sure that the whole predictions are error - free . we introduce three types of strong predictability , _ finite - state strong predictability _ , _ total strong predictability _ , and _ strong predictability _ , which differ with respect to computational ability .",
    "we apply them to the base - two expansion of @xmath3 . on the one hand",
    ", we show that the base - two expansion of @xmath3 is not strongly predictable at @xmath4 in the sense of any of these three types of strong predictability . on the other hand , we show that it is strongly predictable in the sense of all of the three types in the case where @xmath1 is computable real with @xmath5 . in this manner",

    "<S> the statistical mechanical interpretation of algorithmic information theory ( ait , for short ) was introduced and developed in our former work [ k.  tadaki , local proceedings of cie 2008 , pp.425434 , 2008 ] , where we introduced the notion of thermodynamic quantities into ait . </S>",

    "<S> the values of all the thermodynamic quantities diverge when @xmath1 exceeds @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon corresponds to phase transition in statistical mechanics . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the notion of strong predictability for an infinite binary sequence and then apply it to the partition function @xmath3 , which is one of the thermodynamic quantities in ait . </S>",
    "<S> we then reveal a new computational aspect of the phase transition in ait by showing the critical difference of the behavior of @xmath3 between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in terms of the strong predictability for the base - two expansion of @xmath3 . </S>"
