    "essential aspects of the glass transition of the supercooled liquids remain still elusive despite of decades of study . many theories and scenarios",
    "have been proposed to explain the dramatic slow down of the systems and the associated growing cooperative length scales near the glass transition point  @xcite .",
    "they can explain the experimental results equally well or equally poorly but none of them have been proved to be decisively better than other .",
    "even a satisfactory mean - field picture of the glass transition has not been established  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulation of simple model fluids is an ideal route to examine the competing theories .",
    "considerable efforts have been put forward to gain insight from the dynamical behaviors of simple model glassformers _ in silico _ ,",
    "but compelling answers are still lacking .",
    "there are several reasons why the simulation studies are not successful in sorting out numerous scenarios and theories .",
    "first , the model systems are more or less similar ; the pair potentials of canonical glassformers studied in the past are exclusively characterized by short - ranged strong repulsions .",
    "examples are lennard - jones , its wca counterpart , soft - core , and the hard sphere potentials .",
    "since the strong repulsion dominates thermodynamic and dynamic properties of dense fluids , it is hardly surprising that the results for these models are qualitatively similar  @xcite . studies of a completely different class of potential systems may potentially diversify our views and perspectives on the glass transition within the limited accessible time windows of the simulations .",
    "secondly , the model systems are not clean enough .",
    "even the simplest class of model glassformers ( with a few exceptions  @xcite ) are inevitably bidisperse or polydisperse in order to avert the nucleation to the crystalline phase  @xcite .",
    "this complicates quantitative assessment of the simulation results .",
    "finally , we still lack a realistic model glassformer which conforms to the mean - field picture in finite dimensions .",
    "concept of the mean - field scenario of the structural glass transition is basically borrowed from the mean - field theory developed in the spin glass communities  @xcite .",
    "the replica theory  @xcite and mode - coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite are believed to be the static and dynamic versions of the mean - field theory of the glass transition , simply because of their apparent resemblance to the spin - glass counterparts .",
    "the mosaic pictures of the random first order transition theory has been developed as the finite dimension version of this mean field pictures  @xcite . accumulated simulation data are not inconsistent qualitatively from the prediction of the mean field theories but the quantitative agreement between simulation results and theoretical predictions are far from compelling .",
    "the best way to verify the mean - field scenario would be to take the mean - field limit by either going to higher dimensions or making the system s interactions longer - ranged .",
    "recently , simulations for four dimensional systems have been performed  @xcite .",
    "results therein hint that the dynamic heterogeneities are suppressed compared with three dimensional systems and agreement with mct moderately improves  @xcite",
    ". however , considering the current computational abilities , it would be hard to simulate the system beyond four dimension , whereas the upper critical dimension of the glass transition is argued to be eight  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , few studies have been done for realistic liquids with long - ranged particle interactions  @xcite .",
    "the gaussian core model ( gcm ) is a candidate to dispel all of the above - mentioned concerns and could be an ideal and clean bench to compare with various glass theories .",
    "the gcm consists of the point particles interacting with a gaussian shaped repulsive potential  @xcite ; @xmath0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the interparticle separation , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the parameters which characterize the energy and length scales , respectively .",
    "the gcm is one of the simplest models of the so - called ultrasoft potential systems which are characterized by the bounded and long - tailed repulsive potential  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have reported that the one - component gcm vitrifies at very high densities  @xcite .",
    "the gcm or the ultrasoft particles in general have very distinct and exotic properties both thermodynamically and dynamically  @xcite , such as the re - entrant melting at high densities , negative thermal expansion coefficient , and anomalous density dependence of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "there are several studies on the glass transition of the ultrasoft particles  @xcite and it was found that they exhibit rich dynamical behaviors different from conventional model glassformers  @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages to study",
    "the glass transition of the ultrasoft particles is that , due to the mild repulsion tail of the potential , the density as well as the temperature can be used as a parameter to control the system .",
    "exploring the wide range of density  temperature parameter space makes it easier to establish various scaling laws , to bridge the gaps between temperature - driven ordinary glasses and density - driven colloidal glasses , and to help unifying the concepts of the finite - temperature glass transition and the zero - temperature jamming transition  @xcite . however , most studies in the past focused on the relatively low density regime , where the generic nature of the glass transition is not extremely different from that of the conventional model glassformers . the systems at low densities , including the gcm , also had to be either polydisperse or bidisperse in order to avoid crystallization .",
    "the gcm at very high densities is very different  @xcite .",
    "first of all , the system vitrifies without poly(bi)dispersity .",
    "the nucleation rate systematically decreases as the density increases and the system starts exhibiting typical slow dynamics observed in supercooled fluids near the glass transition point .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics is quantitatively well - described by mct .",
    "especially , the mct nonergodic transition point extracted from the simulation unprecedentedly matches with the theoretical prediction . besides , the violation of the stokes - einstein relation and the amplitude of the non - gaussian parameter , both of which is the manifestation of the heterogeneous fluctuations of dynamics , are suppressed .",
    "we conjecture that these facts can be attributed to the long - ranged nature of the interaction potential at the high densities where particles are overlapped .",
    "these results suggest that the high density gcm is not only one of the cleanest model glassformers _ in silico _ , but also the closest to the mean - field model .    in this paper",
    ", we present thorough and complete numerical analysis of the nucleation and glassy dynamics of the high - density and one - component gcm . we not only present the exhaustive set of the numerical results but also provide with the new evidence which bolsters the validity of mct .",
    "detailed analysis of thermodynamic and structural properties of the high density gcm , such as the phase diagram and the static structure factors are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the previous study",
    "@xcite , we have attributed the weak violation of the se relation and smaller non - gaussian parameter to the suppression of the dynamic heterogeneities .",
    "we provide stronger and more direct evidence that intermittent heterogeneous motion is suppressed by monitoring the distribution of the particle displacement as a function of time .",
    "we also evaluate the correlation functions of single and collective density fluctuations .",
    "surprisingly we find that dynamics of the collective density decouple from the single particle density at large length scales , where the former relaxes much faster than the latter .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the ordinary model glassformers for which the slow glassy dynamics set in over the whole length scales for both collective and single particle densities alike .",
    "we compare these simulation results with mct predictions and find that mct beautifully captures the decoupling of dynamics at the large length scales .",
    "however , we also find a subtle but noticeable disagreement of mct from the simulation results at intermediate length scales , where the nonergodic parameter ( the plateau height of the two step relaxation in the density correlators ) predicted by mct shows a weak shoulder which tends to grow as the density increases .",
    "this shoulder is reminiscent of those found for the @xmath4-dimensional hard sphere glasses at large @xmath4 evaluated from mct  @xcite and may be a signal of breakdown of mct at the mean field limit .",
