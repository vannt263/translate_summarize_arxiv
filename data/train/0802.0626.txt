    "a simple realization of a hamiltonian can be achieved if the hamiltonian is @xmath0-local for a small integer @xmath0 . for adiabatic quantum computing ,",
    "a hamiltonian is of interest because its ground state reveals the answer to an interesting problem .",
    "we study in this paper the problem of determining lower bounds on the locality of hamiltonians whose groundstate is a stabilizer code , and show that all such hamiltonians must be at least as complicated as the underlying stabilizer group .    consider a collection of @xmath1 qubits evolving under a constant hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "write @xmath3 and the @xmath1-qubit hilbert space as @xmath4 , so that we might view @xmath5 as a hermitian matrix .",
    "the notion of @xmath0-locality @xcite has been introduced to estimate how physically plausible such a hamiltonian @xmath2 might be . to describe this ,",
    "let @xmath6 be an @xmath1-long list of elements of @xmath7 .",
    "for such an @xmath8 , we create an abbreviation @xmath9 for the appropriate tensor product of pauli matrices .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the set of all such indices @xmath6 .",
    "we use @xmath11 to denote the vector space of hermitian matrices .",
    "this sets notation for the equation @xmath12 containment of the right - hand side follows since tensors of hermitian matrices are hermitian , while the equality follows from linear independence given that the pauli - tensors are orthogonal in the matrix inner product @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "thus , @xmath2 may also be written as @xmath15 if we use @xmath16 to denote the number of nonzero indices , then any summand @xmath17 of @xmath2 denotes a @xmath16-body interaction among the qubits .",
    "we say @xmath2 is @xmath0-local when @xmath18 .",
    "much recent work in quantum complexity theory considers the ground states of @xmath0-local hamiltonians .",
    "for example , an adiabatic quantum computer @xcite must remain in the ground - state of a @xmath0-local hamiltonian at all times .",
    "early works on anyonic excitations of topologically ordered hamiltonians @xcite used hamiltonians whose addends were based on the local structure of some lattice . these were usually @xmath0-local for @xmath0 small .",
    "square lattices produce four local hamiltonians while triangular lattices and their dual hexagonal lattices each produce six local hamiltonians .",
    "another recent topic considers realizing graph states as groundstates @xcite . realizing a graph state in this way is of interest since ( i ) the graph state is a _ nondegenerate _",
    "groundstate which in principle could be obtained from the physical system by cooling , and ( ii ) any quantum circuit may be emulated using one - qubit rotations and measurements of the graph state @xcite . thus realizing a hamiltonian for a large enough graph state , cooling the system , and then applying local control and measurement is equivalent to universal quantum computation .",
    "finally , recent work has considered a constrained family of hamiltonians in order to produce new results on allowed groundstates @xcite .",
    "label @xmath19 as the group with elements @xmath20 , and consider a subgroup @xmath21 .",
    "the stabilizer codespace of @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 the codespace @xmath24 is nonzero if and only if @xmath22 is commutative .",
    "now suppose we have a set @xmath25 of @xmath26 that generate @xmath22 and are at most @xmath0-local .",
    "given commutativity , we may equally well think of the codespace as the ground eigenspace of the following hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath27 even for rather small @xmath0 , in fact even @xmath28 , engineering such a @xmath0-local hamiltonian is challenging .",
    "hence one wishes to find a hamiltonian @xmath29 with the same groundstate eigenspace as @xmath30 yet which is @xmath31-local for @xmath32 .",
    "such a hamiltonian @xmath29 is called an _ effective hamiltonian _ for @xmath30",
    ". this paper provides conditions under which no such effective hamiltonian exists .",
    "two applications result .",
    "first , consider that the hamiltonian whose groundstate is a stabilizer code has created an energy - gap to leaving the code .",
    "this energy gap might be viewed as passive error correction , and our bounds on @xmath31-locality of effective hamiltonians become minimum expenses for obtaining such behavior . in particular , these results provide a quantitative argument that the four - local costs for toric codes @xcite and analogous codes for cellulated surfaces @xcite are the best possible .",
    "a second application regards adiabatic computing , where attempts to drive down the required @xmath0-locality of adiabatic algorithms motivates the search for effective hamiltonians @xcite . in that context , these arguments show that even effective hamiltonians must be at least @xmath0-local for certain fixed @xmath0 .",
    "however , such bounds are only on effective hamiltonians which do not exploit ancillae .",
    "of course , they still apply to systems with ancillae if the ancillae are included in a larger system .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "two notions of locality of a stabilizer subgroup of the pauli group are introduced in ",
    "[ sec : exactestimates ] , and each notion leads to a theorem constraining the inclusion of code spaces into the groundstates of hamiltonians which are excessively local .",
    "a perturbative variant in  [ sec : perturbation ] shows that if the groundspace of an excessively local hamiltonian is too near the stabilizer code , then the gap between the groundstate eigenvalue and the next distinct eigenvalue is pinched .",
    "finally , we consider two examples in  [ sec : examples ] , namely calderbank - shor - steane codes and stabilizer codes arising from cellulations of surfaces .",
    "we write pauli tensors as @xmath33 for @xmath8 and each @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and the other letters denote the usual pauli matrices . for @xmath10",
    "the set of all such indices @xmath6 , the pauli group @xmath19 is @xmath36 .",
    "thus @xmath37 , every nonidentity element @xmath38 has @xmath39 , and all elements of @xmath19 commute or anticommute . for @xmath22 a subgroup of @xmath19 , the stabilizer code of @xmath22 is the subspace of @xmath40 which is the intersection of the @xmath41 eigenspaces of all @xmath42 .",
    "it is known that the code space , say @xmath43 , is nonzero if and only if @xmath22 is commutative .",
    "it is common to refer to @xmath22 as a stabilizer group of @xmath43 when ( conversely ) @xmath43 is the intersection of the @xmath41 eigenspaces of @xmath42 . being less precise , a commutative subgroup @xmath44 is a stabilizer group ( of some nonzero @xmath43 ) .",
    "the discussion requires additional background on stabilizer codes .",
    "in particular , we highlight the following facts .    * lemma : * * [ see . ] * _ ( i ) let @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "then for commutative @xmath22 , @xmath46 is a projector onto the code space of @xmath22 .",
    "else @xmath47 .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath48 and @xmath49 are both in @xmath22 , then the code space is trivial . _",
    "* proof : * the first item is proven in the citation . for the second , the hypothesis requires @xmath50 .",
    "thus @xmath51 , since every element of @xmath19 other than @xmath52 is traceless .",
    "since the projector @xmath53 is traceless , it is zero .",
    "hence its target , the code space , is trivial .",
    "@xmath54    use @xmath55 for @xmath38 to denote the number of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 factors of the tensor product .",
    "in particular , @xmath59 . also , @xmath60 , since any qubit whose tensor factors are @xmath61 in @xmath62 and @xmath63 will have tensor factor @xmath61 in their product . finally , for @xmath64 , we use @xmath65 to denote the subgroup generated by the elements of @xmath25 .",
    "this is standard notation from abstract algebra , and we hope that context will make clear that it is not the dirac notation for the expectation of an operator @xmath25 .    recall from equation [ eq : rbbcombo ] that any hamiltonian on @xmath1 qubits may be written as a real linear combination of pauli tensors .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath0-local if the degree of no monomial summand exceeds @xmath0 .",
    "this is a measure of complexity of the hamiltonian and physical systems that realize it , in that @xmath0-local hamiltonians require at most @xmath0-qubits to interact during any infinitesimal time .",
    "this section presents two results which argue that hamiltonians whose groundstate captures a stabilizer code must be at least as complicated as the underlying stabilizer group .",
    "the complication of hamiltonians is measured in @xmath0-locality . on the other hand , two reasonable definitions of the @xmath0-locality of stabilizer group",
    "are considered in separate subsections .",
    "these two measures are motivated by earlier work @xcite and so are denoted @xmath66 , a lower bound on the weight of @xmath42 , and @xmath67 , in principle an upper bound .",
    "we begin with @xmath66 .",
    "we now define a quantity @xmath66 that may be viewed as a lower bound on the @xmath0-locality of a stabilizer group .",
    "* definition : * let @xmath44 be a subgroup",
    ". then @xmath68 .",
    "the next result implies that any hamiltonian @xmath2 whose groundstate is the stabilizer code must be at least @xmath66 local . to see this ,",
    "normalize so that @xmath2 is traceless by subtracting the appropriate multiple of @xmath61 .",
    "the groundspace of the traceless hamiltonian is then a negative eigenspace .",
    "* proof : * let @xmath69 form a basis for the codespace . recall @xmath53 from the proof of the lemma : @xmath70 while the second expression is an orthogonal decomposition of a projector , the third is a well known formula for a projector onto the code space .",
    "recall the decomposition of the hamiltonian @xmath2 according to equation [ eq : sumofpaulis ] in the introduction .",
    "@xmath71 the traceless condition forces @xmath72 , since for @xmath73 we have @xmath74 . if some coefficient @xmath75 is nonzero , then by hypothesis @xmath76 .",
    "the estimate follows by considering @xmath77 for @xmath42 and @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath79 , since the product has weight at least one . for @xmath80",
    "has weight at least @xmath66 while @xmath81 has weight at most @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , hence @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "therefore @xmath86 since @xmath87 for any @xmath88",
    ". the right hand equality of the equation below follows .",
    "@xmath89 now if @xmath90 , then each term at the far left of equation [ eq : basis ] would be negative , leading to a contradiction .",
    "we now sketch how one might compute @xmath66 , using the stabilizer check matrix @xmath91 of the stabilizer code .",
    "thus @xmath92 corresponding to the choice of generators @xmath93 , i.e. @xmath94 . a @xmath95 in row @xmath0 of column @xmath96 of @xmath97 corresponds to a factor of @xmath56 in qubit position @xmath0 of generator @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is similar .",
    "( see or @xcite . )",
    "since @xmath100 is the number of generators for @xmath22 and @xmath39 for any @xmath38 , one way to calculate @xmath66 would be to enumerate all @xmath101 products of generators .",
    "a possible optimization of this approach would be to delete generators until the set @xmath93 is _ minimal _",
    ", i.e. until the number of rows of @xmath91 is also its rank .",
    "we present a different approach .",
    "namely , suppose that a @xmath102-local tensor product @xmath103 is in @xmath22 .",
    "the support of @xmath80 will be given by @xmath104 , so that @xmath105",
    ". then for @xmath106 an indicator vector of which generators occur in the product for @xmath80 , @xmath107 has @xmath108 and @xmath109 zero outside entries indexed by @xmath25 .",
    "now label @xmath110 as that matrix with the columns of @xmath97 and @xmath99 corresponding to @xmath25 replaced by zero entries .",
    "then @xmath111 is a left - null vector of @xmath110 but not of @xmath91 . on the other hand ,",
    "any left - null vector of @xmath91 , say @xmath112 with @xmath113 , must also satisfy @xmath114 .",
    "thus @xmath115 .",
    "* example : * consider @xmath116 , for which @xmath117",
    ". taking a basis for @xmath91 according to the generating set above yields the equation @xmath118 say @xmath119 , since the first row of @xmath91 recovers the two - local @xmath120 supported on these qubits .",
    "then @xmath121 thus the existence of this two - local element of @xmath22 has caused @xmath115 , which might also be inferred due to the left - null vector @xmath122 .",
    "the algorithm above for computing @xmath66 is polynomial in @xmath1 , at least if @xmath123 .",
    "note however that it is not a polynomial time algorithm should @xmath124 , since then the loop will loop over ( a nonnegligible fraction of ) the power set of @xmath125 .",
    "this section considers @xmath67 , which is an upper bound on the @xmath0-locality of @xmath22 .",
    "however , we do not define @xmath67 to be the maximum of weights of @xmath42 .",
    "for spans the one - dimensional code space of the stabilizer group generated by the @xmath1 hermitian pauli tensors @xmath126 with a single pauli-@xmath127 on qubit @xmath96 .",
    "then @xmath22 contains @xmath128 of weight @xmath1 , yet @xmath129 is local .",
    "thus to get a useful definition of an upper bound we resort to a minimax construction , taking the minimum over all generating sets of @xmath22 of the maximum @xmath0-locality in a given set . the following definition ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is equivalent to that minimax .    *",
    "definition : * for @xmath130 , let @xmath65 denote the subgroup generated by @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath44 be a stabilizer group with nontrivial codespace .",
    "then @xmath67 is the minimal @xmath131 such that .",
    "next we define a subgroup @xmath132 and related notation .    * definition of @xmath132 : * let @xmath133 be a commutative subgroup and @xmath134 .",
    "fix a minimal generating set so that ( i ) @xmath135 and ( ii ) @xmath136 for each @xmath96 . extend this to a minimal generating set so that @xmath137 , where the @xmath138 may be pauli tensors of any degree if @xmath139 . for a bitstring @xmath140 , we label a new subgroup of @xmath19 : @xmath141 the generating set for @xmath132 above is also minimal .",
    "the dependence of @xmath132 on @xmath142 and on the ( ordered ) sequence of generators @xmath143 will be left implicit .",
    "say @xmath134 .",
    "we do not have a result which prohibits certain groundstate eigenspaces for @xmath131-local hamiltonians as would be the case if @xmath144 .",
    "yet there is a result which is similar to this , namely that the eigenspaces of @xmath131-local hamiltonians may not distinguish @xmath22 and other extensions @xmath132 .",
    "this might be of independent interest and will also imply a result similar to the previous one , except that the relevant energies of the traceless effective hamiltonian must be positive rather than merely nonnegative .",
    "* proof : * let @xmath145 such that @xmath146 .",
    "it suffices to show that @xmath147 .",

    "this section produces a similar algorithm for @xmath67 using linear algebra .",
    "however , we first need some more notation .",
    "namely , although the subset of @xmath0-local elements within @xmath22 do not form a subgroup , those elements which only affect any collection of @xmath0-qubits do .",
    "the algorithm for @xmath67 represents these subgroups as matrices and then uses algebra to decide whether their union generates @xmath22 .",

    "henceforth , suppose @xmath22 is fixed with _",
    "nontrivial codespace _ , so that by the lemma @xmath42 demands @xmath177 .",
    "this creates a map from the row space of @xmath91 to @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , since rows of @xmath91 represent generators of @xmath22 , the fact that the row vector @xmath178 lies within the row space implies @xmath179 is an element of @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , although the @xmath180 bitstring does not make clear the choice of sign , the lemma asserts that it is unique .",
    "now recall that @xmath110 is the matrix @xmath91 except that columns corresponding to @xmath181 have been replaced with zero columns . as a consequence of the unique sign choice of the lemma ,",
    "any @xmath180-bit string in the rowspace supported on positions corresponding to @xmath25 likewise determines an element of @xmath182 . for @xmath183",
    "the complement of @xmath91 , such an element of the rowspace might be constructed by creating a left - null vector of @xmath184 .",
    "our two earlier results limit those cases in which a stabilizer code lies within the groundstate of a hamiltonian whose @xmath0-locality is less than some measure of the locality of the stabilizer group .",
    "the two measures of the group s locality were @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath185 .",
    "the result for @xmath66 is stronger even though it applies to fewer hamiltonians , in that it prohibits stabilizer codes within groundstates .",
    "in contrast , the more widely applicable result regarding @xmath67 allows zero eigenspaces of traceless @xmath2 to contribute and also requires some study of auxilliary stabilizer groups @xmath132 .",
    "neither of these results was perturbative .",

    "we will not review the theory of cellulations or their duals , except to note that the dual cellulation associates a vertex to each face of the original and a face to each vertex ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the relevant definitions will imply that @xmath66 is the number of edges in the smallest bounding chain in either the cellulation or its dual .",
    "we also provide a counterexample to the conjecture that @xmath66 is the minimum of the valences of the one - skeleton and dual one - skeleton , although this is frequently the case in examples .",
    "let @xmath25 be an oriented surface with no boundary , and let @xmath225 be a two - complex which is a cellulation of @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath263 denote the vertices , edges , and faces of @xmath225 respectively .",
    "we also suppose a dual cellulation @xmath226 with bijections @xmath264 , @xmath265 , and @xmath266 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "consider the quantum system which associates a qubit to each edge of @xmath225 ( or @xmath226 ) .",
    "a well known topologically ordered stabilizer code has a code space whose dimension is @xmath267 , where the latter is a cellular homology with bit coefficients @xcite . to review this briefly , the generators are indexed by the unions of the faces and vertices of @xmath225 .",
    "let @xmath268 denote the qubit of an edge @xmath269 and @xmath270 denote the pauli tensor which is an identity except for a single @xmath56 factor on qubit @xmath199 .",
    "then the generator associated to a face @xmath271 is @xmath272 .",
    "the generator associated to a vertex @xmath273 may be defined in terms of the dual face @xmath274 .",
    "namely , let @xmath275 , or equivalently tensor over all qubits on edges incident on the vertex .",
    "the stabilizer code is then @xmath276 .",
    "such a code is @xmath227-split . as an aside",
    ", the associated hamiltonian @xmath277 is of interest independent of its homologically structured degenerate groundstate , in that the excitations out of this groundstate are abelian anyons with @xmath278 gauge @xcite .    before considering the topological order as an @xmath227-split stabilizer code , we set the following notation for homological boundary operators . @xmath279",
    "consider matrices @xmath280 and @xmath281 for @xmath282 and @xmath283 respectively .",
    "consider a column of @xmath280 .",
    "it contains entries of @xmath284 at precisely those positions corresponding to edges @xmath285 such that @xmath286 for @xmath271 the column label . a similar comment applies to @xmath281 , so that the stabilizer check matrix of @xmath22 has this form : @xmath287 here , the superscript @xmath288 denotes transpose . also , we list face operators before vertex operators when forming the matrix , else an antidiagonal matrix results . thus , in the special case of a topological order",
    ", it is possible to compute @xmath66 and @xmath67 using only homological inputs , namely the matrices of the appropriate boundary maps in the cellulation and cocellulation .",
    "however , @xmath66 and @xmath67 clearly depend on the cellulation rather than the topology of the underlying surface . to emphasize that point , note that for @xmath289 we may associate @xmath290 to the size of a boundary in @xmath291 , while a similar comment applies to @xmath247 and @xmath292 .",
    "hence , @xmath66 is the minimum of the smallest number of edges required to support a boundary in either @xmath225 or @xmath226 .",
    "since one may always subdivide an edge , this is not a topological invariant .",
    "it is tempting given the last paragraph to conjecture that @xmath66 is the minimum of the valences of the one - skeleta of @xmath225 and @xmath226 , i.e. of the graphs which result by ignoring faces ( two - cells ) in either .",
    "in fact , this is incorrect .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] provide a counterexample , in that the boundary with the least number of edges in @xmath225 does not bound a single face .",
    "since the locality of a hermitian matrix might serve as a crude figure - of - merit for its experimental difficulty , theorists hope to find interactions which are both highly local and have robust stabilizer quantum codes as their groundstate eigenspaces ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this manuscript constrains such efforts by arguing that excessively local effective hamiltonians either do not exist or else have undesirable properties .",
    "the three main results argue that ( i ) no effective hamiltonian may be more local than the minimum locality of any element of the stabilizer group , ( ii ) effective hamiltonians which do not allow for more nonlocal pauli tensors in the stabilizer group must also be effective hamiltonians for many other stabilizer groups , and ( iii ) approximating a stabilizer code using an excessively local hamiltonian leads to gap pinching .",
    "nonetheless , the technical statements given here might lead to new examples .",
    "speculating in a slightly broader context , there are two ways one might attempt to use @xmath0-local hamiltonians to simulate @xmath293-local systems of interest .",
    "one might ( a ) exploit crosstalk mediated by an ancilla or ( b ) pulse noncommuting hamiltonians ( absent ancilla ) .",
    "our results do not account for clever use of ancilla .",
    "indeed , ancillae have been used successfully to construct effective hamiltonians in the adiabatic computing literature @xcite . on the other hand , our results argue that hamiltonians whose addends are _ noncommuting _ pauli tensors must nonetheless obey certain locality constraints on their groundspaces .",
    "thus , the ancilla - based approach might be preferable .",
