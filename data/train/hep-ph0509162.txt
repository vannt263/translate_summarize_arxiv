    "the scalar potential quark confinement has been proposed as a significant model in hadron physics . in order to account for the observations of spin - orbit splitting , that the short range coulomb potential was a lorentz vector and the long range confining potential",
    "a lorentz scalar was proposed by henriques , kellett , and moorhouse @xcite .",
    "there is no color magnetic field to act on the quarks spin . as buchmller @xcite pointed out that a color electric flux tube should automatically yield the desired pure thomas spin - orbit interaction because there is no color magnetic field in the quark rest frame .",
    "the milan group clarified this question dramatically around 1990 . using the low velocity wilson loop formalism pioneered by eichten and feinberg , and later by gromes @xcite",
    ", they found both the spin - dependent and spin - independent relativistic corrections in heavy onia@xcite .",
    "their result was that the long - range spin - independent qcd corrections differed from those of scalar confinement , though the long - range spin - orbit corrections were the same pure thomas ones given by scalar confinement .",
    "these results were subsequently verified by lattice simulations of qcd @xcite .",
    "the scalar quark confinement models remain popular in spite of the inconsistency with qcd , probably because of their relative ease of solution .",
    "we point out here that the predictions of scalar confinement also conflict directly with experiment .",
    "we study the scalar potential , time component vector potential and flux tube quark confinements and relativistic flux tube model in this paper .",
    "we investigate the dependence of heavy - light meson mass on the mass of the light quark .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we exhibit a solution for scalar quark confinement in section ii . in section iii",
    ", we compare the predictions of the quark confinement with the experimental result and find that the predictions of the scalar confinement and the time component vector confinement are in considerable conflict with measured values while the flux - tube confinement works well to explain the experimental data .",
    "we review the relativistic flux tube model in section iv . under two limit",
    "we solve the equations for the relativistic flux tube model in section v. an exact numerical solution is also demonstrated . in section",
    "vi , the comparison of the numerical solution with an analytical approximation solution is discussed .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in section vii .",
    "we consider a potential field consisting of central lorentz scalar and time component vector fields , @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively . to simplify our derivations",
    ", we assume that scalar confinement @xmath2 and a time component vector short range interaction , @xmath3 . for a spinless",
    "quark @xmath4 moving in this potential field , we find    @xmath5    we wish to treat the short range parameter @xmath6 and the light quark mass @xmath4 as small perturbations . in the case where both @xmath6 and @xmath4 vanish , the zeroth order hamiltonian is @xmath7    where    @xmath8    the hamiltonian @xmath9 has the same eigenstates as its square which , with the replacement @xmath10 , leads to the harmonic oscillator equation , @xmath11 where in the limit of small @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is normalized to @xmath15 the solution for the wave function and eigenvalue is standard ; @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the usual laguerre polynomial , @xmath18 is a positive integer starting with @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is a non - negative integer starting with zero .",
    "we now determine the effect of turning on @xmath6 and @xmath4 using the feynman - hellmann theorem @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is any parameter of the hamiltonian .",
    "taking the expectation values using the @xmath23 wavefunctions ( [ soln0 ] ) will yield an expansion in these parameters . to leading order",
    "we have @xmath24    the expectation values are worked out in general in the appendix . here",
    "we only consider the @xmath4 and @xmath6 dependence of the 1__s _ _ and 1__p _ _ states ( i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the results are , @xmath27    using eq .",
    "( [ expan ] ) , we obtain the @xmath4 dependence near @xmath23 ( @xmath4 slope ) for the energies , @xmath28 again using eq .",
    "( [ expan ] ) we obtain the @xmath6 dependence near @xmath23 ( @xmath6 slope ) for the energies , @xmath29    next we compare our analytic values for the slopes at @xmath30 in eqs .",
    "( [ me1s ] ) to ( [ kdiff ] ) with our numerical method .",
    "this step is important because a general analytic solution of the spinless salpeter equation is not known . only for the remarkable case of a massless particle and linear scalar confinement , which is equivalent to the non - relativistic harmonic oscillator",
    ", can one obtain an analytic solution . in the general case ,",
    "one must rely on exact numerical solutions .",
    "some time ago , a variational method , the galerkin method , was introduced into particle physics to solve the spinless salpeter equation with a time component vector interaction@xcite .",
    "this very robust method is applicable to a wide range of differential and integral equations .",
    "the method has been sharpened over the years by many authors @xcite .",
    "one can cope with eigenvalue equations for operators that are complicated functions of both momenta and coordinates , such as the scalar confinement hamiltonian ( [ hams ] ) , by using basis functions that can be fourier transformed .",
    "we have performed a careful numerical solution of the eigenvalue equation for the hamiltonian ( [ hams ] ) , for small @xmath6 and @xmath4 , and found the @xmath4 and @xmath6 slopes .",
    "the results are in excellent agreement with the values obtained by analytic calculation in eqs .",
    "( [ me1s ] ) through ( [ kdiff ] ) .",
    "we first use experimental data to demonstrate , rather conclusively , that spin splittings within a given orbital angular momentum multiplet do not depend on the light quark mass .",
    "in particular , we consider several heavy - light meson spin multiplets in which both the strange and non - strange members have been observed @xcite .",
    "first we examine the @xmath31 and @xmath32 type mesons with @xmath33 ( _ s_-waves ) .",
    "the hyperfine splittings for @xmath32 and @xmath31 mesons are @xmath34 the corresponding _",
    "s_-wave hyperfine splittings for @xmath35 type states are @xmath36 it is clear that the substitution of a strange quark for a non - strange light quark changes the _",
    "s_-wave hyperfine differences by at most a few mev .",
    "we next consider some measured _ p_-wave heavy - light spin splittings . from @xcite",
    "we find , @xmath37    again we note the apparent vanishing of light quark mass dependence this time in a _",
    "p_-wave spin splitting .",
    "we conclude that spin splittings are only weakly dependent on the light quark mass .      in the preceding subsection we observed from experiment that both _ s_-wave and _ p_-wave heavy - light spin splittings ( within a spin multiplet ) were independent of the light quark mass .",
    "we next consider the mass splittings between pairs of states corresponding to different orbital angular momenta and examine the light quark mass dependence of this difference .",
    "we choose the @xmath40 _ p_-wave state and the pseudoscalar @xmath31 meson . the best measurements are @xmath41 when the @xmath42 light quark is replaced by a strange quark , the corresponding difference becomes @xmath43 the differences @xmath44 and @xmath45 are amazingly similar .",
    "we see that they differ by @xmath46    we demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ subsec : spinsplit ] that both @xmath39- and @xmath38-wave spin splittings are , within error and isospin uncertainty , independent of light quark mass .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the @xmath4-dependence of the difference @xmath47 also represents the @xmath4-dependence of the spin - averaged 1@xmath38 - 1@xmath39 excitation energies . to show this explicitly , we write the hl meson mass as the sum of the heavy quark mass and the excitation energy , @xmath48 we then separate the excitation energy into spin - averaged and spin - dependent parts , @xmath49 as in eqs .",
    "( [ spd ] ) and ( [ spsd ] ) , we define @xmath45 and @xmath44 to be the differences between @xmath38-wave ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath39-wave ( @xmath51 ) states , for strange and non - strange light quarks respectively . using our observation that the spin - dependent parts are essentially independent of light quark mass , we see that the spin dependent parts will cancel in the difference @xmath52 .",
    "thus @xmath53 measures the light quark mass dependence of the spin - independent 1@xmath38 - 1@xmath39 level difference .",
    "two main results emerge from this subsection .",
    "first , the light quark mass dependence is only about 2% of the measured level difference .",
    "this is a useful tool in the analysis of heavy - light spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "second , although it is small , @xmath54 is definitely not zero .",
    "we will use the actual value ( [ diff ] ) to test the predictions of various assumptions about the nature of quark confinement .      we are now prepared to compare carefully the different confinement predictions with experiment .",
    "as we noted , the @xmath4 dependences of all the heavy - light states are amazingly similar .",
    "we have also noted that this universal @xmath4 dependence is nearly satisfied in an analytical calculation . in the example with scalar confinement , the @xmath4 slope for the difference 1__p__@xmath551_s _ is about 30 times smaller than each separate slope .",
    "furthermore , we noted in sec .",
    "[ subsec : massdiff ] that when one compares two heavy - light states , one _ p_-wave and one _ s_-wave , the difference changes by less than 2% when a non - strange light quark is replaced by a strange one .",
    "this change is not zero however , but for the @xmath40 and @xmath31 states has the experimental value ( [ diff ] ) @xmath56 in fig.1 we show the numerical mass splittings of heavy - light mesons for three different confinement scenarios , all with the same short range energy @xmath57 , and the same @xmath58 , as a function of light quark mass .",
    "each of the three confinement scenarios has the same asymptotic confinement force , @xmath59  gev@xmath60 .",
    "the upper curve assumes linear scalar confinement , the middle curve is the prediction of the relativistic flux tube and the lower curve linear time component vector confinement . in the scalar and time component vector potentials , the potentials @xmath0 and",
    "the long - range part of @xmath1 respectively are @xmath61 . in the case",
    "relativistic flux tube model the string tension is @xmath62 .",
    "1_s _ energy level difference on the light quark mass @xmath4 .",
    "the numerical results compare different confinement mechanisms ( all with the same long range confinement force @xmath59  gev@xmath60 and all three calculations assume the same short range coulombic constant @xmath58.)[fig:1 ] ]    we note that the scalar confinement has the most rapid increase of the 1__p__@xmath551_s _ difference as the light quark mass increases .",
    "the flux tube confinement is intermediate and time component vector linear confinement actually decreases slightly . using the reasonable values for the strange quark mass ( 500 mev ) and the non - strange mass ( 300 mev ) , we find the following values for @xmath54 , @xmath63 in comparing these values to the experimental value given in eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) , @xmath64 we observe that both scalar confinement and time component vector confinement are quite inconsistent with the experimental result",
    ". however , the flux tube confinement prediction is in agreement with the experimental result .",
    "from the above study on the different quark confinement models , we observe that flux tube confinement prediction is in agreement with the experimental result . next we continue our research on the flux tube model and concentrate on the relativistic flux tube ( rft ) model@xcite .",
    "the rft model or qcd string play an important role in describing the relativistic meson states .",
    "its fundamental assumption is that the qcd dynamical ground state for large quark separation consists of a rigid straight tube - like color flux structure connecting the quarks and for massless quarks it reduces to nambu string.@xcite this model is consistent with both spin - dependent and spin - independent qcd expectations while the scalar confinement potential model@xcite is not consistent with spin - independent qcd relativistic correction . even though with this simple physical picture the rft model coincides with the qcd relativistic correction derived from the rigorous wilson loop formalism .",
    "we now review the spinless quarks and straight qcd string model and give the rft equations .",
    "consider a heavy - light ( hl ) meson made up of two spinless quarks , one heavy quark with mass m and one light quark with mass @xmath65 .",
    "they satisfy the conditions as @xmath66 and @xmath67 where a is the confinement constant and r is the interquark separation . since the center of mass remains close to the heavy quark in the hl meson , the constraint that the total momenta perpendidicular to the rotation axis and to the interquark axis vanish is automatically satisfied . for a heavy - light meson ( hl )",
    ", we obtain the equations of qcd string as@xcite ,    @xmath68    where@xmath69 and @xmath70 are angular momentum and energy of the meson respectively , v(r ) represents the short range potential .",
    "we also define the functions :    @xmath71   \\label{eq.4}\\\\ w_r = \\sqrt{p_r ^2 + m^2 } \\label{eq.5}\\\\ \\gamma_\\bot^2 = \\frac{1}{1- v_\\bot^2 } \\label{eq.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "0.3 cm      0.3 cm we now consider the light quark of a hl meson moves circularly around the heavy quark which is at rest in the center of the circular motion .",
    "so this will reduce the @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this reduction yields @xmath74    when pluging into the general hl rft equations , we obtain    @xmath75    therefore we find the @xmath76 slope for the hl meson is    @xmath77    0.3 cm      0.3 cm    that the qcd string reduces to a time component vector potential was shown under the deep radial limit in which @xmath78 .",
    "it is reasonable to apply the semi - classical quantization condition for a spherically symmetric system to quantize the qcd string ,    @xmath79    where @xmath80 represent the radial distances at the turning points of the motion . using this semi - classical quantization condition",
    "we obtain the following equation satisfied by the semi - classical tcv integral for hl meson ,    @xmath81    where    @xmath82    we have defined that    @xmath83    when evaluating eq .",
    "(  [ bb ] ) we need replace the classical angular momentum with langer correction to take into account the centrifugal singularity , namely @xmath84 .",
    "we give an exact result of this tcv integral for the heavy - light mesons by means of numerical method .",
    "the relation([bb ] ) of angular momentum and energy in ground state of the system when @xmath85 is shown in fig.2 .",
    "on @xmath86 in the ground state of a heavy - light meson .",

    "we find the new relation of angular momentum and energy in the system is    @xmath89    according to the above equation , we may draw the graphs representing the relation of angular momentum and energy numerically . considering the ground state of the quark system and choosing @xmath90 separately , the modified curves due to the short range color coulomb potential are shown in fig.4 .",
    "note that for a fixed @xmath91 , higher @xmath6 value curve gives the lower energy .",
    "this is due to the color coulomb potential we take .    , the left dashed curve corresponds to the @xmath92 while the middle dashed one is for @xmath93 .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ]",
    "we now derive an analytic approximation of rft considering @xmath78 and @xmath85 . to this purpose ,",
