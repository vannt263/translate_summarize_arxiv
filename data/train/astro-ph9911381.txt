    "x - ray emission from knots and hotspots in radio jets has been detected in only a handful of objects .",
    "the three processes normally considered for x - ray emission from these features are synchrotron , thermal , and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emissions .",
    "the hotspots of 3c295 ( taylor & perley 1992 ) have radio brightness temperatures comparable to those of cygnus a but are so close to the nucleus that previous x - ray systems could not resolve them . however , the chandra x - ray observatory@xmath0 has the ability not only to separate the emission from the 3c295 cluster gas , core , and hotspots , but in addition , it allows us to obtain spectra of each component .",
    "ssc models predict x - ray intensities in agreement with those observed only for the case of the hotspots of cygnus a ( harris , carilli , & perley 1994 ) . the fact that the observed x - ray flux agrees with the calculated ssc flux for a magnetic field strength equal to the classical estimate from equipartition lends credence to the ssc model but does not prove it .",
    "for all the other previously detected knots and hotspots , the predicted ssc flux falls well short of the observed flux , often by two or three orders of magnitude .    in this paper",
    "we present chandra observations of 3c295 , describe the basic results , and evaluate the emission process for the x - rays from the radio hotspots .",
    "we use h@xmath1=70 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath3=0.7 , and @xmath4=0.3 . at a redshift of 0.461 ,",

    "the calibration observation of 3c295 was performed on 1999 aug30 for an elapsed time of 20,408s .",
    "the target was near the aim point on the s3 acis chip .",
    "we generated a clean data set by selecting the standard grade set ( 0,2,3,4,6 ) , energies less than 10  kev , and excising times with enhanced background rates .",
    "the screened exposure time for the observation is 17,792  s.    during standard processing , photon events are assigned fractional pixel locations due to spacecraft dither , rotation between detector and sky coordinates , and an additional randomization within each @xmath15 acis pixel .",
    "we used the fractional pixel values to generate images with @xmath16 pixels .",
    "figure 1 shows the central region after adaptive smoothing with a gaussian constrained to have @xmath17 .",
    "overlaid are the radio contours from a 20 cm merlin+vla image ( leahy et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the acis - s image in figure 1 shows that the central region of the 3c295 cluster exhibits significant structure with an x - ray core and two outer features aligned with the radio hotspots .",
    "this observation is an excellent example of the resolving power of chandra .",
    "3c295 was previously observed by the einstein hri ( henry & henriksen 1986 ) and the rosat hri ( neumann 1999 ) but the spatial resolution of these instruments was comparable to the separation of the two x - ray hotspots and these features were thus not detected .",
    "the acis image in figure 2 shows that the core and two hotspots are not simple , azimuthally symmetric features , suggesting that these regions are resolved by chandra . to determine if the core and hotspots are extended we must model the cluster emission .",
    "the region outside a @xmath18 radius is well fit with a @xmath19 model with @xmath19=0.54 and core radius @xmath20 ( 24  kpc ) .",
    "the residual x - ray data above this model are shown superimposed on the hst image in figure  2 .",
    "inside @xmath21 there is clearly excess emission above the @xmath19 model , surrounding the nuclear   and   hotspot   sources .",

    "the x - ray data have been shifted by @xmath23 to align the x - ray and radio cores .",
    "the nw hotspot is at a projected distance of @xmath24 ( 11 kpc ) from the core and the se hotspot is @xmath25 ( 16 kpc ) from the core .",
    "attempted to remove this by fitting a double @xmath19 model to the data with the nuclear and hotspot regions excluded .",
    "this removed the surrounding emission fairly effectively , allowing us to study the size of the central components . to test these components for intrinsic extension",
    ", we compared the ratio of net counts in two concentric regions centered on these features in the residual image",
    ". the ratios of net counts between 0 and @xmath15 and from 0.5 to @xmath26 for the northwest ( nw ) hotspot , and southeast ( se ) hotspot are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ( poisson errors ) .",
    "we use the acis - s image of pks0637 - 72 to determine this ratio for an imaged point source , finding a ratio of @xmath29 . based on this statistic",
    ", there is tentative evidence in the chandra data for some extension of the hot spot x - ray sources .",
    "however , this result is subject to uncertainties in the shape of the underlying diffuse distribution . in the case of the nuclear source",
    "these systematics are dominant , and no useful extension test is possible .",
    "the response matrices for the s3 chip have been calibrated on 32 by 32 pixel regions .",
    "there are also twelve effective area files covering the s3 chip .",

    "the cylinder for the nw hotspot has @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for the se hotspot , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "b@xmath35 is the minimum pressure field for no protons and filling factor=1 .",
    "the ssc model provides good agreement between the classical equipartition magnetic field estimates and the average field values required to produce the observed x - ray intensities . since the equipartition estimates were made with no contribution to the particle energy density from protons , this agreement supports the hypothesis that relativistic electrons account for a major part of the the energy density .",
    "if future observations show that the x - ray emission is actually extended over a physical distance of 9 kpc , it is unlikely that ssc can be the sole process operating , because the photon energy density will be much lower outside the compact core of the radio hotspot .",
    "ssc is a mandatory process and the only uncertainty in the predictions is the value of the magnetic field . as was the case for the hotspots of cygnus",
    "a , the only viable model to negate these conclusions is one with a much stronger magnetic field : i.e. significantly greater than 500 @xmath36 g .",
