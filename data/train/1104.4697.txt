    "rare earth titanates ( r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ) are an interesting family of materials showing rich ferroelectric @xcite and magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "the common crystal structures @xcite for these materials are cubic pyrochlore for small rare earth ions ( sm@xmath3  lu@xmath3 ) and monoclinic for large rare earth ions ( la@xmath3  nd@xmath3 ) . the magnetic properties of the former have been explored extensively during the recent years @xcite . the subtle interplay among the various interactions including crystal field , exchange and dipole - dipole , coupled with geometrical frustration specific to the pyrochlore lattice @xcite , has led to exotic magnetic phases such as spin ice @xcite and spin liquid @xcite .",
    "these phases are extremely sensitive to doping and external stimuli such as pressure @xcite and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "interesting dynamic processes have also been identified @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the rare earth titanates with a monoclinic structure have received much less attention . due to the removal of geometric frustration ,",
    "these materials are believed to possess magnetically ordered phases at low temperatures . however , the competition between the crystal field and exchange interactions ( plus dipole - dipole ) with close energy scales may lead to interesting and unusual dynamic freezing processes towards the ordered states . in this regard ,",
    "it is essential to retrieve the magnitude of the crystal field , exchange and the dipole - dipole interactions , in order to study the magnetic freezing processes .",
    "here we focus on the monoclinic nd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  ( nto ) . some features of nto , such as the ferroelectricity @xcite , the optical magnetoelectric effect @xcite and the photo - catalysis effect @xcite , receive current interests in these materials . in this work , we study the dc susceptibility and specific heat of nto single crystals . the anisotropic paramagnetism is investigated in detail .",
    "we found that crystal field interactions dominate the anisotropy , and exchange interactions @xmath4 are estimated by combining the results of the diluted samples .",
    "the ground state of nd@xmath3 spins splits into five kramers doublets in the crystal field associated with the @xmath5 site in @xmath6 space group .",
    "the magnetic field splits the ground state doublet into two singlets , as is evidenced by the specific heat at different fields , showing a two - level schottky scheme with the energy gap proportional to the field .",
    "these studies lay solid ground for further investigation of this system under doping and external perturbations .",
    "single crystals of nd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  and nd@xmath7la@xmath8ti@xmath0o@xmath1  were grown by the floating zone method in flowing oxygen .",
    "seed rods for the single crystal growth were polycrystalline nd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  and nd@xmath7la@xmath8ti@xmath0o@xmath1  sintered by the standard solid state reaction in oxygen atmosphere , with starting materials of stoichiometric mixture of nd@xmath0o@xmath9 , la@xmath0o@xmath9 and tio@xmath0 powder ( alfa aesar ) .",
    "oxygen atmosphere was used to avoid oxygen deficiency .",
    "the lattice constants were obtained by fitting the peak positions of the x - ray diffraction pattern on polycrystals obtained by crushing nd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  single crystals .",
    "the single crystals were cleaved along @xmath10 direction , and the in - plane @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions were determined by the laue diffraction .",
    "dc susceptibility were measured with a quantum design superconducting interference device magnetometer ( squid mpms-5 ) with fields of up to 5 t. dc susceptibility at higher fields were measured by the vibrating sample magnetometer option in a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the in - plane angular dependence of the magnetization were measured using a commercial sample rotator in mpms , the diamagnetic background of the sample holder was carefully subtracted . for the susceptibility measurement along different crystalline directions ,",
    "the alignment of the crystal along the direction of the magnetic field was maintained within the error of @xmath13 .",
    "specific heat was measured in a ppms using the thermal relaxation technique .",
    "the as - grown nto single crystals are of high quality and large size benefiting from the floating zone method .",
    "the samples are monoclinic in space group @xmath6 , the diffraction peaks of the polycrystals obtained by crushing nto single crystals are well indexed as shown in fig . [",
    "xrd](a ) , and resultant lattice parameters are @xmath14  , @xmath15  , @xmath16  , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "due to the layered structure , the crystal cleaves naturally along the ( 100 ) direction , as is shown in the xrd pattern in fig .",
    "[ xrd ] ( b ) . in fig .",
    "[ xrd ] ( c ) , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.09@xmath19 of the rocking curve further indicates good crystallinity of the sample .",
    "the single crystals were cleaved and shaped into disks with typical dimensions of diameter @xmath20 1.5 mm and thickness @xmath20 0.2 mm .",
    "the disk shape mitigated the effect of demagnetization factor in the in - plane anisotropy of magnetization .",
    "however , we still corrected the demagnetization using the calculated value @xcite @xmath21 for @xmath22 and 0.12 for @xmath23 respectively .",
    "in fig . [ pm ] ( a1)(c1 ) , we show @xmath24 at 1000 oe with @xmath25 and @xmath22 for a single crystal and a polycrystal sample , respectively . the zero - field - cooled and field - cooled @xmath24 overlap in the entire temperature range in study ( 2  300 k ) , showing typical paramagnetic behavior .",
    "however , @xmath24 is clearly anisotropic when comparing the behavior of the single crystal with @xmath25 and @xmath22 , as well as that of a polycrystal . above 150 k ,",
    "the system follows the curie - weiss law with the effective moment of 3.44  3.49 @xmath26 , close to the theoretical value of 3.62 @xmath26 ( an experimental value @xcite is 3.5 @xmath26 ) . the resultant weiss temperature @xmath27 varies from 10.4 k for @xmath25 to @xmath28 k for @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath27 for the polycrystal , which can be taken as the average effect from all the crystalline directions , is @xmath29 k. the negative weiss temperature of the polycrystal indicates an effective antiferromagnetic correlation between nd@xmath3 spins . by comparing fig .",
    "[ pm ] ( a1 ) with ( b1 ) , we see that the in - plane magnetization is more than three times larger than the @xmath22 case , this suggests that the nd@xmath3 spins prefer to align in the @xmath30 plane .",
    "[ pm ] ( a2)(c2 ) show the isothermal magnetization curves for @xmath31 along different crystalline directions .",
    "as is expected for a paramagnetic system , @xmath32 shows no hysteresis , is linear at high temperatures , and shows convex curvatures at low temperatures due to the spin polarization process .",
    "the @xmath32 curves measured with the field applied along different directions again show strong anisotropy .",
    "moreover , the in - plane @xmath32 curves themselves show anisotropy .",
    "[ m - theta ] ( a)(d ) show the angular dependence of the in - plane magnetization .",
    "a two - fold symmetry is found at all fields and temperatures .",
    "the normalized in - plane anisotropy @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the mean value of @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ m - theta ] ( e ) .",
    "the magnetization along the @xmath12 axis is roughly two times larger than that along the @xmath11 axis . as we already noted",
    "that the nd@xmath3 spins prefer to align in the @xmath30 plane , the @xmath12 axis is thus determined to be the easy axis of nd@xmath3 spins",
    ".    we also show @xmath37 with fields along different in - plane directions in fig .",
    "[ m - theta ] ( f ) .",
    "@xmath37 at different in - plane angles are parallel to each other at @xmath38 k , as expected for paramagnetism with the same effective moments but different weiss temperatures .",
    "the angular dependence of weiss temperatures @xmath27 is shown in fig .",
    "[ m - theta ] ( g ) .",
    "magnetic anisotropy , in particular magnetization anisotropy in paramagnets were previously reported in rare earth compounds @xcite .",
    "the primary origin of this anisotropy is the crystal electric field .",
    "when an ion is placed within a crystal lattice , the degeneracy of the hund s rule ground state multiplet can be lifted by the electric field from the surrounding atoms . in a rare earth compound such as nto",
    ", the cystal field can overcome the external field and pull the total moment resulting from the spin - orbit coupling into a certain direction .",
    "the anisotropic exchange coupling also contributes to the magnetic anisotropy . to separate the contribution of crystal field from exchange to the magnetic anisotropy ,",
    "a series of diluted samples nd@xmath7la@xmath8ti@xmath0o@xmath1 were studied .",
    "nonmagnetic la@xmath3 has very close ionic radius to that of nd@xmath3 , it dilutes the nd@xmath3 spins and keeps the lattice almost unchanged .",
    "thus , in a good approximation , the crystal field does not change with dilution while the exchange interaction decreases systematically with increasing la@xmath3 content .",
    "because the weiss temperature of the system reaches as low as @xmath39 k for nd@xmath40la@xmath41ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , and even lower for samples with lower nd@xmath3 content , which makes it difficult to realize a reliable fitting using the curie - weiss law with the @xmath42 data in the temperature range of 2  300 k , only the data of nd@xmath40la@xmath41ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is presented here .",
    "the nd@xmath3 content is determined indirectly by calculating the effective moment of the powder sample . by writing down the magnetic hamiltonian",
    ", it is possible to extract both exchange and crystal field contributions to the angular dependent magnetization by assuming a constant crystal field contribution for the la@xmath3 diluted sample . following the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , the magnetic hamiltonian consists of two parts , the exchange energy @xmath43 and the crystal field energy @xmath44 ( the dipolar interaction can be assimilated in the exchange energy @xcite ) . the exchange interaction is anisotropic and can be expressed as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 denote the three crystalline directions , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the exchange constants for nd@xmath3 spins along @xmath50 and @xmath12 directions , respectively .",
    "the crystal field part , for the low - symmetry @xmath5 site of the nd@xmath3 , is known to be @xmath51 where @xmath52 are crystal field parameters , and @xmath53 are stevens equivalent operators . it is known that the high temperature susceptibility of a system with only one spin species can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the curie constant , @xmath12 is the percentage of the magnetic ions on the spin lattice , in nd@xmath7la@xmath8ti@xmath0o@xmath1 case , @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are the exchange tensor and the crystal field tensor , and can be expressed by the parameters in eq .",
    "[ eq - exchange ] and eq .",
    "[ eq - cf ] respectively",
    ". when the three axes of the crystal are of at least second - order symmetry ( symmetry no lower than @xmath59 ) , eq .",
    "[ eq - ki-1 ] can be expressed with the parameters in eq .",
    "[ eq - exchange ] and [ eq - cf ] along each crystalline direction as    @xmath60    here , @xmath61 denotes the crystalline direction @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 , @xmath62 are the exchange constants as already appeared in eq .",
    "[ eq - exchange ] , and @xmath63 is the @xmath61 direction component of tensor @xmath58 . in specific symmetries , @xmath63 can be expressed explicitly with the crystal field parameters @xmath52 .",
    "the weiss temperature is then    @xmath64    however , in the nto case , the symmetry of nd@xmath3 site is barely @xmath5 , an explicit expansion of @xmath58 is thus difficult .",
    "therefore only the exchange parameter @xmath4 is extracted and the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq - theta ] is left as a single parameter @xmath65 to be determined .",
    "the results of the curie - weiss fitting for diluted samples suggest that the contributions to the weiss temperature from the exchange interactions @xmath66 and crystal field interactions @xmath67 are of opposite signs .",
    "the fitted weiss temperature @xmath27 , and the contributions from exchange interaction and crystal field @xmath68 and @xmath65 in all three crystallographic orientations for nto and nd@xmath40la@xmath41ti@xmath0o@xmath1 are listed in table i. with these weiss temperatures , the exchange constants are determined to be @xmath69 k , @xmath70 k and @xmath71 k. it can be seen that the exchange constants are positive in all crystallographic orientations .",
    "this illustrates the dominant role of the crystal field contribution to the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "while the exchange interactions are always ferromagnetic , the apparent exchange deduced from the weiss temperature in different directions can be either positive or negative .",
    "this is because the crystal field contributes a large negative part to the weiss temperature .",
    "as seen from table i , @xmath65 is a couple of times larger in magnitude than @xmath68 along @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes and comparable in magnitude along the @xmath12 axis , making the weiss temperature large and negative along @xmath10 , @xmath11 directions and small but positive along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "it is also worth to note that eq .",
    "[ eq - ki ] is independent of the magnetic field .",
    "indeed , we see that in fig .",
    "[ m - theta ] ( e ) , the normalized in - plane anisotropy @xmath33 is nearly constant for different fields at the same temperature . only when spins are polarized significantly by the field , i. e. , m(h ) curve is not linear anymore , @xmath33 at different fields bifurcate , as is the case at 2 k.    as we have discussed , the monoclinic nto does not accommodate geometrical frustration .",
    "however , with the absence of a magnetic transition down to at least 2 k , and the average weiss temperature @xmath72 k , the frustration index as defined by @xmath73 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) of this system reaches about 21 , and is even higher along @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions . the large frustration index may indicate an unusual ground state and interesting spin freezing processes .",
    "these investigations are currently under way .",
    "the magnetic ground state of @xmath74 nd@xmath3 on the @xmath5 site in the @xmath6 space group should split into five kramers doublets due to the crystal field .",
    "calculations on the nd@xmath3 in the same symmetry in other compounds indeed revealed the five doublets scheme @xcite , while a detailed calculation on nto is still lacking .",
    "the specific heat measurement provides more information on the magnetic ground state .",
    "[ specific - heat ] ( a)(c ) show the magnetic specific heat of nto for h @xmath75 a , h @xmath75 bc and that of nd@xmath40la@xmath41ti@xmath0o@xmath1 for h @xmath75 a at different fields .",
    "the magnetic specific heat is obtained by subtracting the lattice contribution using the specific heat data of a nonmagnetic la@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystal .",
    "the zero - field specific heat in principle detects any magnetic phase transitions , and the magnetic entropy associates directly with the ground state degeneracy . in fig .",
    "[ specific - heat ] ( a ) , the zero - field magnetic specific heat shows no anomaly for a magnetic transition , which is consistent with the paramagnetic behavior above 2 k. there is a progressive upturn as @xmath76 decreases , which signals the presence of a large portion of the magnetic entropy below 2 k. the magnetic entropy is therefore difficult to integrate due to the limited temperature range .",
    "however , this problem is bypassed by using the specific heat in a magnetic field . as shown in fig .",
    "[ specific - heat ] ( a ) , @xmath77 in a field shows a broad peak with the magnitude of around 3.6 j / mol@xmath78 k at low temperatures , and the maximum moves to higher temperatures with its magnitude almost unchanged as the field increases .",
    "these indicate that the peaks are schottky anomalies associated with the ground state doublet splitting in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the two - level schottky specific heat is , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the gas constant , and @xmath81 is the energy gap between the two levels .",
    "[ eq3 ] describes the data nicely as shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ specific - heat ] ( a ) .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ specific - heat ] ( d ) that the fitting parameter @xmath81 scales linearly with magnetic field .",
    "this further proves that the gap between the two schottky levels are caused by the zeeman splitting of the ground state doublet . using @xmath82 , the @xmath2 factor for nto with @xmath31 along @xmath10",
    "is found to be 1.99 .",
    "the magnetic specific heat is also studied in nd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  with @xmath23 and in nd@xmath40la@xmath41ti@xmath0o@xmath1 with @xmath22 . for nto with @xmath23 ,",
    "the @xmath2 factor is 3.10 .",
    "the anisotropy in @xmath2 factor again points to the presence of strong crystal field , and these @xmath2 values should be corroborated with future crystal field calculations .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied both single- and poly - crystalline nd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  with angle - dependent dc susceptibility and specific heat . the anisotropic paramagnetism is observed and is mainly attributed to the crystal field effect .",
    "the easy axis is determined to be the @xmath12-axis in the @xmath30 plane .",
    "the contributions to weiss temperature from exchange interactions and crystal field interactions are separated .",
    "the exchange interactions are ferromagnetic , while the crystal field contributes a large negative part to the weiss temperature , along all three crystallographic directions .",
    "this leads to large negative @xmath27 values along @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes and small positive @xmath27 along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "the @xmath74 ground state multiplet of nd@xmath3 splits into five kramers doublets .",
    "the ground state doublet further splits into two singlets in a magnetic field , and this two - level ground state scheme is revealed by the magnetic specific heat .",
    "@xmath2 factors show anisotropy too , again due to the crystal field .",
