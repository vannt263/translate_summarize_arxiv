    "stochastic resonance ( sr ) has attracted considerable attention of many researchers during the last quarter century  @xcite . at first sr",
    "was proposed to explain the observed periodicities in global climate dynamics  @xcite .",
    "sr occurs when the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for the response of a single nonlinear system to a subthreshold sinusoidal input signal has its maximum at a nonzero noise strength @xmath0 . as well - known , the sr effect is understood as enhancement of the system input to a subthreshold input signal by addition of noise .",
    "there are many studies on sr for a single element .",
    "for example gammaitoni _",
    "_ showed with snr that a subthreshold sinusoidal signal to a single threshold element is optimally transduced by appropriate additive noise  @xcite .",
    "collins _ et al . _ also reported that a single neuron can optimally transmit a slowly varying subthreshold aperiodic signal with the aid of appropriate additive noise  @xcite .",
    "they proposed the power norm @xmath1 and the normalized power norm @xmath2 in order to measure a correlation between the input signal and the output signal and showed that both @xmath1 and @xmath2 monmonotonically vary with increasing the noise strength .",
    "it is known as _ aperiodic stochastic resonance _ ( asr ) .",
    "many researchers have both experimentally and numerically studied the symmetrical stochastic resonator such as the schmitt trigger  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the central attention of sr seems to move to a network of the stochastic resonators , instead of a single stochastic resonator , such as the global coupled networks and linear chains  @xcite . in more recent years a parallel array of nonlinear elements gathers a lot of attention , where the parallel array means that the nonlinear elements are connected in parallel and convergent on a summing center  @xcite .",
    "recently stocks studied the parallel array of the nonlinear devices and reported that the suprathreshold stochastic resonance ( ssr ) can be observed on these array motivated by applications to signal processing  @xcite . also from the standpoint of neurophysiology collins _",
    "et al . _ and chialvo _ et al .",
    "_ studied an parallel array of noisy neurons can exhibit asr for slowly varying signal  @xcite .",
    "consequently it is important to consider the parallel array in both signal processing and neurophysiology .",
    "the main focus of the article is to find an optimal threshold to transmit an arbitrary signal on the parallel array of the bithreshold elements .",
    "according to the assumption that the amplitude of the input signal is smaller than the standard deviation of the noises we derive an analytical approximation of the normalized power norm .",
    "under this assumption it is not necessary to distinguish between subthreshold and suprathreshold .",
    "furthermore we apply the linear response theory to the system that we consider in the article .",
    "the fundamental idea is the noise - induced linearization , which is an effect that an ensemble average of output from a nonlinear system is linearized due to noise  @xcite . from the theoretical approximation of the normalized power norm",
    "we show that there exists the optimal threshold to maximize it .",
    "in fact stocks and mannella numerically showed that for a summing network of fitzhugh - nagumo equations adjusting the threshold to maximize information transmission does not remove sr effects .",
    "they pointed out that there is a optimal threshold to maximize the mutual information  @xcite .",
    "our result is consistent with their indication .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : simulation ] we perform numerical simulations for the model and show that the threshold value at the maximum normalized power norm depends on the variance of the additive noises .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",

    "the input to the bithreshold element is transmitted over noisy channel .",

    "we have @xmath63 where we use @xmath64 , which is proven by employing an ergodic assumption . hence from eqs .",

    "@xmath2 has it maximum at @xmath90 .",
    "however for @xmath86 it differs from the theoretical equation .",
    "the reason is because the output signal @xmath17 is not well approximated by the linear response of the input signal @xmath3 due to the limit of applying the linear response theory .",
    "this disagreement is originated from difference between the nonlinear response of the system and the linear response assumed in sec .",

    "we confirmed that the theoretical approximation of @xmath2 is consistent with the results obtained from the direct numerical simulations of the array of the bithreshold elements when the norm of the input signal is smaller than the standard deviation of the additive noises . while for the larger norm than the standard deviation the difference between the approximation and the numerical results appears .",
