    "the quarks - gluons mass is nothing else but polarization correction to its self - energy .",
    "this quantity is a real correction to quarks - gluon self energy , no matter if particle is on or out of mass surface .",
    "therefore , this assumption does not lead to impossibility to use katkowski rules for the full cross section calculations by using the optical theorem @xcite .",

    "this parameter also discount ( check ) quarks self - energy according theory of renormalizable ( see eq .",
    "( [ masspl ] ) andless ) . its calculation can not be performed exactly since the perturbation theory is not applicable in the qcd theory .",
    "justification for investigate this not momentum dependence parameter can be obtained in modern effective field theory and quantum hadrodynamics ( see for example @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this correction @xmath12 must be small , but greater with respect to quark mass .",
    "however , it can lead to some physical effects .",
    "namely , we show that the self - energy correction leads to a significant change in the lepton - hadron scattering cross section .",
    "this effect takes place because the set of ladder diagrams with infinite number of gluon lines must be taken into account .",
    "thus , the intercept correction is of order @xmath13 , and the logarithm is of order @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the squire of transferred momentum ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "formally , the contribution of structural function to cross section becomes important at small @xmath17 , but at these moment perturabtive ladder approximation does not work , and the polarization correction is not known so far .",
    "it is known that at large transfer moment polarizability contribution can be taken into account by renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath18 , since these contributions can be factorized and by using the ward identity @xcite . in this case",

    "comparison of the cross - section calculated in this way with experimental results is a possible indirect way to estimate the value of possible quarks - gluon mass @xcite .",
    "it is important to say that processes of creation of other particles also give a contribution to `` gluon mass '' , therefore our effective @xmath25 is assumed to take into account these contributions too .",
    "this gives as a possibility to describe the quasiperturbative region of scattering when @xmath17 is not very large , and maybe even when @xmath17 is rather large , in contrast to the previous results , we the polarization correction was calculated at large @xmath17 @xcite.it is shown ( eq.([transfer ] ) ) , that in case large @xmath17 our results traversed to results @xcite . at fig1.,2",

    "analytically this `` sewed '' give formula ( [ transfer])-([endres ] ) . also , the non - singlet diagrams give the biggest contribution at @xmath26 , but in this case delta - functions will give large contributions in terms which is difficult to calculate , and we did not take into account .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , for example , that these diagrams lead to a good description of experiment at @xmath27 .",
    "finally , section 3 . contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "let us use the axial gauge @xmath28 .",
