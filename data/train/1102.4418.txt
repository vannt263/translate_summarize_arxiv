    "in 1948 , casimir proposed the existence of a force of magnitude @xmath8between two parallel perfectly conducting plates of area @xmath9 which are separated by a distance @xmath10 due to the vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic field @xcite . since 1970s , casimir effect has aroused the interest of many researchers for its close relations with many other areas of physics such as quantum field theory , atomic physics , condensed matter physics , nanotechnology , astrophysics and mathematical physics @xcite .",
    "although the original proposal of casimir considered only the electromagnetic field in the @xmath11 minkowski spacetime , nowadays the scope of casimir effect includes all other quantum fields in arbitrary spacetimes of arbitrary dimensions .",
    "however , most of the works on casimir effect in higher dimensional spacetimes considered only scalar fields . in some works , the simple relation between the casimir force on a pair of large parallel plates due to a massless scalar field and the casimir force on a pair of large parallel plates due to an electromagnetic field is wrongly extended to other geometric configurations .    by definition ,",
    "the zero temperature casimir energy is a divergent sum of the zero point energies of a quantum field .",
    "there are various methods such as cut - off method and zeta regularization method to remove the divergence and extract a physically meaningful casimir energy .",
    "however , these divergence removal procedures can sometimes lead to ambiguities . in 2004 ,",
    "the piston configuration was introduced @xcite and it quickly attracted a lot of attention because the divergence of the casimir energy in this configuration can be unambiguously removed .",
    "the zero temperature casimir force acting on a piston due to scalar fields or electromagnetic fields in the @xmath11 minkowski spacetime was soon investigated in @xcite .",
    "this was then extended to rectangular piston in minkowski spacetimes of arbitrary dimensions @xcite and to the finite temperature effect @xcite . lately",
    ", there is an interest in considering the piston configuration in spacetimes with extra dimensions such as the kaluza - klein spacetime and the randall - sundrum spacetime @xcite .",
