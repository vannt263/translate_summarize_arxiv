    "the theoretical problem of strong correlations coupled with nonequilibrium has become an active area of research in recent years , in part due to the enormous success in realizing experimental systems which can be driven out of equilibrium in a controlled manner .",
    "some examples of these are current carrying quantum dots and single molecule devices  @xcite , strongly driven ferromagnetic systems  @xcite , cold atoms trapped in optical lattices with rapidly tunable parameters  @xcite .",
    "one of the theoretical challenges in the study of out of equilibrium strongly correlated systems is that , unlike systems in equilibrium which are characterized by some underlying principles such as the energy minimization principle , no basic underlying principles are known for out of equilibrium systems making it rather difficult to develop general theoretical techniques to study them .",
    "perhaps the most actively studied out of equilibrium systems are nonequilibrium quantum impurity models which are systems characterized by a few local degrees of freedom coupled to one or more reservoirs ( as in a quantum dot or a molecular conductor ) , and where nonequilibrium is achieved by maintaining the reservoirs at different chemical potentials and/or by subjecting the system to time - dependent fields . for strong local interactions the ground state of quantum impurity models",
    "show many - body resonances such as the kondo or polaronic resonance .",
    "the effect of current flow on these resonances has been studied using a variety of methods such as renormalized perturbation theory  @xcite , flow equation methods  @xcite , real time renormalization group on the keldysh contour  @xcite , and functional renormalization group methods  @xcite .",
    "while these approaches are applicable when the external drive is large as compared to the kondo temperature , in the opposite limit of drive small compared to the kondo temperature , perturbative methods based on fermi - liquid theory have been used  @xcite .",
    "there have also been efforts at developing exact solutions based on the construction of exact scattering states in the presence of current flow  @xcite .",
    "there are also several promising numerical methods that are being developed such as the real - time numerical renormalization group method  @xcite , quantum monte carlo computation of real time keldysh diagrams  @xcite , iterative summation of real time path integrals  @xcite and the imaginary time formulation of real - time nonequilibrium problems  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will use large - n methods  @xcite to study a nonequilibrium quantum impurity model .",
    "in particular , we will study the anderson model when the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath7 , and in addition the system has been driven out of equilibrium due to current flow . @xmath0 here will represent the degeneracy of the impurity level .",
    "the physical systems this corresponds to are quantum dots or molecular devices where the level active in transport is characterized by a total angular momentum @xmath8 which is large , and hence has a large degeneracy @xmath9 .",
    "this could arise due to the particular form of the confining potential in the quantum dot , or by the use of a molecule where conduction occurs via a metal ion with a partially empty outermost @xmath10 or @xmath11 orbital .",
    "note that the infinite - u anderson model under out of equilibrium conditions has so far been studied using the non - crossing approximation ( nca )  @xcite and slave boson mean - field methods  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will also employ the slave - boson representation which is a convenient way to project out all states except the empty and singly occupied state of the dot  @xcite . however",
    ", we will go beyond mean - field by including the effect of fluctuations to @xmath3 .",
    "our theoretical approach is closest to that of read _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , but carried out for a nonequilibrium system using keldysh functional integral methods .",
    "a few words on the regime of validity of the results presented in this paper .",
    "the @xmath7 limit of the anderson model is the so called mixed - valence regime where the system is characterized by both local charge as well as spin fluctuations",
    ". the kondo regime may be accessed by making the bare level energy large and negative in which case the charge fluctuations are frozen out and only the spin - fluctuations exist .",
    "this limit can be taken in a straightforward way in all physical observables .",
    "thus we will present results for the nonequilibrium static spin susceptibility and the conductance in both the mixed valence as well as in the kondo regime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we present the model , and write it as a keldysh path - integral suitable for studying nonequilibrium systems . in section  [ results ] we briefly present the main results of the paper before turning to the full calculation . in section  [ meanfield ]",
    "we study the keldysh path integral in the limit of @xmath12 when a mean - field or saddle - point approximation becomes exact . in this limit the voltage dependence of the local charge density , static susceptibility and the conductance",
    "are derived .",
    "following this , the rest of the paper is devoted to the study of the effect of fluctuations to @xmath13 .",
    "as found by read et al  @xcite , the @xmath14 corrections are in general associated with infra - red divergences whose origin is the zero - mode of the slave - boson representation . while the infrared divergences are logarithmic in equilibrium , we find that out of equilibrium the divergences become more severe with a pole structure .",
    "however , just as in equilibrium , in the computation of all physical observables these infrared divergences are found to cancel so that the final expressions are well defined .    the @xmath15 computation is organized as follows . in section  [ fluc ] the mean - field saddle point expressions for the level position and the level broadening",
    "are corrected to @xmath15 . in section  [ nf ]",
    "the local impurity charge density is computed . in section  [ xray ] the bosonic correlation function",
    "is evaluated .",
    "while in equilibrium the bosonic correlation function has a power - law decay in time with an exponent consistent with x - ray edge physics  @xcite , for the current carrying case we find that the long time behavior has both a power - law as well as a rapid exponential decay in time , the latter arising due to current induced decoherence .",
    "the bosonic correlation function appears in the computation of various physical observables .",
    "we present results for the static susceptibility in section  [ susc ] , while expressions for the impurity spectral density and conductance are presented in  [ spect ] .",
    "many of the details of the computation are relegated to the appendices .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ conc ] .",
    "we use the slave - boson representation  @xcite of the infinite - u anderson model which is a convenient way to project out all except the empty and singly occupied states of the impurity level .",
    "the hamiltonian in this representation is , @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the spin - projection of the local level , n=2j+1 is the degeneracy of the level , @xmath18 represent the lead electrons , and we have generalized to the case where there are two leads ( labeled by @xmath19 ) which will be maintained at two different chemical potentials @xmath20 to capture the nonequilibrium current carrying case .",
    "@xmath21 is the hybridization to the two the leads .",
    "the above hamiltonian is accompanied by the constraint @xmath22 to ensure that the system remains within the restricted hilbert space of an empty or singly occupied local level .",
    "we write the keldysh path integral  @xcite for eq .",

    "this lack of symmetry when @xmath46 arises due to the fermi - level dependence of the kondo temperature . to see this we set the coupling to one of the leads ( say @xmath47 ) to zero .",

    "in contrast , the terms of the type @xmath50 in eq  [ suscsumm ] are purely nonequilibrium terms that arise due to inelastic scattering processes in the energy window @xmath4 when there is current flow , and are thus associated with current induced decoherence .",
