    "the study of the phase structure of qcd at non - zero temperature @xmath0 and non - zero quark chemical potential @xmath1 is currently one of the most attractive topics in particle physics @xcite .",
    "the heavy - ion collision experiments aiming to produce the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) are running at bnl and cern , for which the interesting regime is rather low density .",
    "moreover a new color superconductor phase is expected in the region of low temperature and high density . in the last few years",
    ", remarkable progress has been achieved in the numerical study by monte - carlo simulations of lattice qcd at low density .",
    "it was shown that the phase transition line , separating hadron phase and qgp phase , can be traced out from @xmath2 to finite @xmath1 , and it was also possible to investigate the equation of state quantitatively at low density .",
    "the main difficulty of the study at non - zero baryon density is that the monte - carlo method is not applicable directly at finite density , since the fermion determinant is complex for non - zero @xmath1 and configurations can not be generated with the probability of the boltzmann weight .",
    "the most popular technique to study at non - zero @xmath1 is the reweighting method ; performing simulations at @xmath3 , and then modify the boltzmann weight at the step of measurement of observables @xcite .",
    "the glasgow method @xcite is one of the reweighting methods .",
    "a composite ( glasgow ) reweighting method has recently been proposed by @xcite .",
    "another approach is analytic continuation from simulations at imaginary chemical potential @xcite .",
    "moreover , calculating coefficients of a taylor expansion in terms of @xmath1 is also a hopeful approach for the study at non - zero baryon density @xcite .",
    "the studies by taylor expansion or imaginary chemical potential require analyticity of physical quantities as functions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while the reweighting method has a famous  sign problem \" .",
    "the sign problem is caused by complex phase fluctuations of the fermion determinant , which are measured explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite , and also ref .",
    "@xcite is a trial to avoid the sign problem .    in this paper , we make comments on the reweighting method with respect to more than one simulation parameter , particularly , including a chemical potential . because the fluctuation of the modification factor ( reweighting factor ) enlarges the statistical error , the applicable range of this method is determined by the fluctuation of the reweighting factor .",
    "when the error becomes considerable in comparison with the expectation value , the reweighting method breaks down . an interesting possibility is given in the following case : when we change two parameters at the same time , the reweighting factors for two parameters might cancel each other , then the error does not increase and also the expectation values of physical quantities do not change by this parameter shift . therefore finding such a direction",
    "provides useful information for mapping out the value of physical quantities in the parameter space .",

    "the reweighting method is based on the following identity : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the quark matrix , @xmath7 is the gauge action , @xmath8 is the number of flavors ( @xmath9 for staggered type fermions instead of @xmath8 ) , @xmath10,$ ] @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 = f[g ] - \\langle f[g ] \\rangle$ ] .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the bare quark mass and chemical potential in a lattice unit , respectively .",
    "the expectation value @xmath16 can , in principle , be computed by simulation at @xmath17 using this identity @xcite . however , a problem of the reweighting method is that the fluctuation of @xmath18 enlarges the statistical error of the numerator and denominator of eq.([eq : rew ] ) .",
    "the worst case , which is called  sign problem \" , is that the sign of the reweighting factor changes frequently during monte - carlo steps , then the expectation values in eq.([eq : rew ] ) become vanishingly small in comparison with the error , and this method does not work .",

    "this is helpful information for the study of qcd thermodynamics .",
    "let us start with the case of su(3 ) pure gauge theory on an anisotropic lattice , having two different lattice spacings for space and time directions : @xmath28 and @xmath29 . as we will show for this case",

    "a significant feature of a monte - carlo simulation at a first order phase transition point is the occurrence of flip - flops between configurations of hot and cold phases .",
    "if one write a histogram of the action density , i.e. the plaquette : @xmath36 and @xmath37 , there exist two peaks . the value of the action density changes sometimes from one near one peak to one near the other peak during monte - carlo steps @xcite .",
    "the flip - flop is the most important fluctuation ; in fact , the flip - flop makes the strong peak of susceptibilities of observables such as the plaquette or the polyakov loop at the transition point .",
    "also , the flip - flop implies strong correlations between @xmath36 and @xmath38 because the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 change simultaneously between the typical values of the two phases in the @xmath39 plane .    here",
    ", we discuss the fluctuation of the reweighting factor when one performs a simulation at the transition point , @xmath40 .",
    "an expectation value of @xmath41 at @xmath35 on an anisotropic lattice is calculated by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 for simplification , we ignore the local fluctuation around the two peaks of the histogram of the action density and consider only the flip - flop between hot and cold phases , since it is the most important fluctuation at the first order phase transition point .",
    "then , the fluctuation is estimated by the difference of the reweighting factor between hot and cold phases , up to first order , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the average values of the spatial and temporal plaquettes for configurations in the hot ( cold ) phase and @xmath48 is the number of sites for an @xmath49 lattice .",
    "hence , along the line which has a slope @xmath50 the fluctuation of the reweighting factor is canceled to leading order .    on the other hand , since @xmath51 and @xmath52 , pressure is defined by @xmath53 , \\label{eq : press}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the expectation value of the plaquette on a @xmath56 lattice for the normarization .    by separating the configurations into those in hot and cold phases @xcite , the gap of pressure between hot and cold phases at @xmath57 is computed by @xmath58 .",

    "in fact , eq.([eq : dp0cond ] ) and the vanishing pressure gap , @xmath73 are confirmed by calculating the slope of the transition line from the peak position of the polyakov loop susceptibility obtained by numerical simulations in ref .",
    "historically , the non - zero gap of pressure at the transition point had been a problem for long time .",
    "the reason of @xmath74 was that the precise non - perturbative measurement of the anisotropy coefficients , @xmath75 etc .",
    ", had been difficult , and the perturbative value @xcite can not be used at the phase transition point for @xmath76 or @xmath77 . after the precise measurement of the anisotropy coefficients became possible , the problem of a non - zero pressure gap was solved .",
    "also , determinations of these coefficients by another non - perturbative method have been done in refs .",
    "@xcite .    from eq.([eq : dirmin ] ) and eq.([eq : dp0cond ] ) , we find that the direction which minimizes the fluctuation of the reweighting factor must be the same as the direction of the phase transition line in the @xmath35 plane , if pressure in hot and cold phases are balanced at @xmath57 , @xmath67 . here , in practice",
    ", we estimate the fluctuation of @xmath78 by a numerical simulation .",

    "ellipses in fig.[fig : conpure ] are the contour lines of the standard deviation normalized by the mean value : @xmath83 and we write this value in fig .  [ fig : conpure ] .",
    "we also denote the phase transition line , obtained by the measurement of the polyakov loop susceptibility assuming that the peak position of the susceptibility is the phase transition point @xcite , by a bold line , and dashed lines are the upper bound and lower bound .",
    "we find that the phase transition line and the line which minimizes fluctuations are consistent .",
    "this result also means that the reweighting method is applicable in a wide range for the determination of the phase transition line in the parameter space of su(3 ) gauge theory on an anisotropic lattice , since the increase of the statistical error caused by the reweighting is small along the transition line .",
    "we note that , from eq.([eq : dp0cond ] ) , @xmath84 and @xmath85 in eq.([eq : sgflc ] ) are equal under the change along the phase transition line , hence the fluctuations are canceled in every order of @xmath86 . for su(3 ) pure gauge theory on an anisotropic lattice , the system is independent of @xmath87 in a physical unit , hence the system does not change along the transition line except for the volume , @xmath51 , if @xmath88 is finite . increases @xcite . ]",
    "because physical quantities does not change without the fluctuation of reweighting factor , this result is quite natural .",
    "next , we extend this discussion for the case of full qcd with a first order phase transition such as 3 flavor qcd near the chiral limit . the reweighting method is applied in the parameter space of @xmath89 .",
    "we consider helmholtz free energy density @xmath90 for a canonical ensemble which is equal to minus pressure , @xmath91 , for a large homogeneous system . under a parameter change from @xmath89 to @xmath92 , the variation of the free energy",

    "we change @xmath14 and @xmath19 along the phase transition line starting at two points : just above and just below @xmath4 , without crossing the transition line",

    "therefore , the fluctuation of the reweighting factor along the phase transition line remains small , i.e. the statistical error does not increase so much .",
    "we obtained the same result as for the pure gauge theory on an anisotropic lattice , and this argument seems to be quite general for models with a first order phase transition , including models with chemical potential .",
    "however , there is a difference . under the change of @xmath87 , any physics does not change along the @xmath57 line , but physical quantities , in general ,",
    "depend on the quark mass .",
    "although the dependence on @xmath14 might be much smaller than the dependence on @xmath107 , if the fluctuation of the reweighting factor is completely canceled , any @xmath14-dependence is not obtained . in this discussion",
    ", we ignored the local fluctuation around the peaks in the hot and cold phase respectively , but the local fluctuation may play an important role for the @xmath14-dependence .",
    "also , the sign problem for nonzero baryon density is caused by complex phase fluctuations of the reweighting factor ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : phase ] . ) , that is by the local fluctuations .",
    "hence the local fluctuation may , in particular , be important at non - zero baryon density .",
    "as we have seen in the previous two sections , the multi - parameter reweighting seems to be efficient to trace out the phase transition line in a wide range of the parameter space .",
    "one of the most interesting applications is finding the ( pseudo- ) critical line @xmath108 in the @xmath89 plane for 2 flavor or 2 + 1 flavor qcd . the phase transition for 2 flavor qcd at finite quark mass",

    "we also denote the lower and upper bounds of @xmath193 by bold lines , which are obtained by the measurement of the chiral susceptibility @xcite .",
    "we find that there exists a direction along which the increase of the fluctuation is relatively small , and this direction is roughly parallel to the phase transition line . because we expect that physics is similar along the transition line , if we consider that @xmath184 is the important part for the calculation of @xmath4 , this result is quite reasonable . as well as in the @xmath89 plane ,",
    "the fluctuation of the reweighting factor is small along the phase transition line in the @xmath194 plane , and the reweighting method seems to be efficient to trace out the phase transition line .",
    "this must be a reason why the phase transition line can be determined for rather large @xmath20 in ref .",
    "however , in this discussion , we omitted the complex phase fluctuation , and the phase fluctuation is the most important factor for the sign problem . as we will discuss in the next section , the value of @xmath20 for which the sign problem arises depends strongly on the lattice size .",

    "it has been also discussed for measurements of spatial correlation lengths to confirm the reliability of the analytic continuation from imaginary chemical potential @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth to discuss the complex phase fluctuation in order to know the region of applicability of generic reweighting approaches . if the reweighting factor in eq.([eq : rew ] ) changes sign frequently due to the complex phase of the quark determinant , then both numerator and denominator of eq.([eq : rew ] ) become very small in comparison with the statistical error",
    "of course , the complex phase starts from zero at @xmath136 but grows as @xmath20 increases .",
    "it is important to establish at which value of @xmath20 the sign problem becomes severe .    as discussed in the previous section , the phase can be expressed using the odd terms of the taylor expansion of @xmath135 .",
    "the complex phase is @xmath211 the explicit expression for @xmath151 and @xmath212 are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dermu1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dermu3 ] ) .    because the sign of the real part of the complex phase changes at @xmath213 , the sign problem occurs when the typical magnitude of @xmath214 becomes larger than @xmath215 .",
    "we use the point at which the magnitude of the phase reaches the value @xmath215 as a simple criterion to estimate the parameter range in which reweighting methods will start to face serious sign problems .",
    "if the sign problem arises at small @xmath20 , which is expected to happen for a large lattice , the first term in eq.([eq : phase ] ) is most important .",
    "then we can estimate the applicability range by evaluating the fluctuation of @xmath216 .",
    "moreover we expect naively that the magnitude of @xmath217 $ ] is proportional to @xmath129 , therefore the value of @xmath20 at which the sign problem arises decreases roughly in inverse proportion to the number of site @xmath129 . also , the situation is different on lattices of moderate size . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the first term in eq.([eq : phase ] ) is dominant for @xmath218 and @xmath219 but the higher order terms can not be neglected for @xmath220 , by calculating the complex phase without the approximation by the taylor expansion . if the higher order terms are not negligible , the volume dependence is not simple .",
    "e.g. in the case that the term of @xmath221 plays an important role for the determination of the applicability range of the reweighting method , the applicability range is expected to decrease in proportion to @xmath222 , and similarly @xmath223 for the case that the @xmath224 term is important .",
    "we consider the leading term and the next leading term of the complex phase .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath214 must be zero at @xmath136 because the partition function is real .",
    "although the average of the phase is zero , its fluctuations remain important .",
    "we investigate the standard deviation of @xmath214 up to @xmath221 , @xmath225 , using configurations generated on a @xmath113 lattice for the study of ref .",
    "@xcite , and also the standard deviations of @xmath226 and @xmath227 are computed .    the random noise method is used to calculate @xmath214 for each configuration .",
    "then , the value of @xmath214 contains an error due to the finite number of noise vectors @xmath228 . to reduce this error",
    ", we treat the calculation of @xmath229 more carefully . since the noise sets for",
    "the calculation of the two @xmath214 in the product must be independent , we subtract the contributions from using the same noise vector for each factor .",
    "details are given in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite . by using this method",
    ", we can make the @xmath228-dependence of @xmath229 much smaller than that by the naive calculation from rather small @xmath228 , hence it may be closer to the @xmath230 limit .",
    "we took @xmath231 for this calculation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : stdr13 ] , we plot the standard deviations of the @xmath232 term , @xmath226 , and the @xmath221 term , @xmath227 , for @xmath154 , @xmath233 .",
    "the horizontal axis is temperature normalized by @xmath57 at @xmath136 @xmath234 .",
    "the temperature scale is determined from the string tension data in ref .",
    "@xcite with the fit ansatz of ref .",
    "the fluctuations of these terms are almost of the same magnitude and both of them are small in the high temperature phase , hence the sign problem is not serious in the high temperature phase .",
    "we , moreover , confirm that the @xmath232 term is dominant around @xmath235 , as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite , and the approximation by @xmath232 term for the discussion of the applicability range in ref .",
    "@xcite is valid for the @xmath113 lattice .",
    "this suggests the applicability range decreases roughly in proportion to @xmath236 .",
    "however , in general , the magnitude of the fluctuation ( standard deviation ) of @xmath237 changes as a function of the volume , hence the detailed finite size analysis is necessary to investigate the volume dependence of the applicability range more precisely .",
    "recently , analysis of the volume dependence of the applicability range has been reported in ref .",
    "their numerical result of the applicability range is in proportion to @xmath222 .",
    "this is much better than @xmath236 . because their estimations are based on simulations on @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath238 and @xmath239 lattices , the applicability ranges are relatively large , and the higher order terms in @xmath20 should be important for large @xmath20 .",
    "therefore the result of the volume dependence , @xmath240 , is reasonable for their lattice size , but may will change on large lattices .",
    "we also show the contour plot for @xmath241 in fig .  [",
    "fig : contpf ] .",
    "the error of the contour is estimated by the jack knife method . at the interesting regime for the heavy - ion collisions : @xmath242 for rhic and @xmath243 for sps , the fluctuation is smaller than @xmath215 in the whole range of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the reweighting method seems to be applicable for the quantitative study for the heavy - ion collisions , which is an encouraging result .",
    "also , we find that a point around @xmath244 looks singular . because we expect the fluctuation of the system diverges at a critical point , this might be related to the presence of a critical endpoint .",
    "the large fluctuation around @xmath245 is occurred by the @xmath221 term being large around there .",
    "this might be corresponding that , in general , the contribution from the higher order terms of the taylor expansion becomes larger , as the critical point is approached , and the expansion series does not converge near the critical point . plus sign and minus sign appear with almost equal probability , i.e. @xmath246 is almost zero , when the standard deviation of @xmath214 is larger than @xmath247 .",
    "the value of @xmath248 at which the standard deviation of @xmath214 is @xmath247 around @xmath57 is of the order @xmath249 .",
    "however , we should notice that the complex phase , again , is very sensitive to the lattice size @xmath129 . for small lattice size , the sign problem is not severe and the reweighting method can be used for considerably large @xmath20",
    ", however the applicability range of the reweighting method will be narrower for a lattice with a size larger than @xmath113 .",
    "also the analysis of quark mass dependence must be important as a part of future investigations .",
    "at present , the reweighting method is an important approach to the study of qcd at finite baryon density .",
    "we discussed the applicability range of the reweighting method with multi - parameters .",
    "the fluctuation of the reweighting factor during monte - carlo steps is a cause of the increase of the statistical error due to the reweighting , and the magnitude of the fluctuation determines the applicable range .    for a simulation of su(3 )",
    "pure gauge theory at the first order phase transition point on an anisotropic lattice , the fluctuation is minimized along the phase transition line in the parameter space of an anisotropic lattice , if we assume the pressure in hot and cold phases to be balanced .",
    "this argument can also be applied in full qcd , if the theory has a first order phase transition , and the same relation between the fluctuation of the reweighting factor and the phase transition line is obtained .",
    "this suggests that the multi - parameter reweighting method is an efficient method for trace out the phase transition line in multi - parameter space .",
    "moreover , the measurement of thermodynamic quantities on the phase transition line is important for the finite size scaling analysis to discuss the universality class .",
    "the reweighting method is useful for this purpose .",
    "we also measured the fluctuation of the reweighting factor in numerical simulations of 2 flavor qcd for the cases of the reweighting in quark mass and chemical potential .",
    "there exists a direction of small fluctuation in the @xmath89 plane and it is roughly the same direction as that of the phase transition line . the fluctuation of the reweighting factor with respect to chemical potential can be separated into two parts : the complex phase factor of the fermion part and , on the other hands , the absolute value of the fermion part and the gauge part .",
    "these two parts fluctuate almost independently during monte - carlo steps .",
    "this implies that the phase factor of the fermion part does not influence the shift of @xmath4 with increasing @xmath20 at small @xmath20 , and also explains why the difference between the phase transition lines for usual chemical potential and iso - vector chemical potential is small at low density .",
    "if we neglect the complex phase factor , the increase of the fluctuation is also small along the phase transition line in the @xmath250 plane , as well as in the @xmath89 plane .    the value of @xmath20 for which the sign problem arises decreases as the lattice size @xmath129 increases , hence simulations at @xmath251 are more difficult for larger lattices , even if the fluctuation of the absolute value of the reweighting factor is small along the phase transition line .",
    "the complex phase fluctuation is measured on a @xmath113 lattice .",
    "the sign problem is not serious in the high temperature phase , but around the phase transition point it becomes serious gradually from this lattice size . for small lattices ,",
    "the sign problem is not severe for the study at low density , and also for the @xmath113 lattice , the applicability range of the reweighting method covers the interesting regime for heavy - ion collisions .",
    "also , the behavior of the complex phase fluctuation around the transition point suggests a critical endpoint in the region of @xmath252 .",
