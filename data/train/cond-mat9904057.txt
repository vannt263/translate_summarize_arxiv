    "the structure of the impurity band of semiconductors has been widely studied during the last two decades both theoretically and experimentally ( see monograph@xcite ) . in the early theoretical studies",
    "the spin structure of the impurity band was completely ignored .",
    "recent experiments suggest that the spin structure is very important for the variable range hopping conductivity , especially near the metal - non - metal transition@xcite",
    ".    the exchange interaction must be the main mechanism of the spin - spin interaction in the impurity band .",
    "it appears as a result of the overlap of the wave functions of different states .",
    "the scale of this interaction decreases exponentially with increasing distance between the states .",
    "thus , this interaction becomes the most important one near the metal - non - metal transition . in this region",
    "the scale of the interaction is of the order of the binding energy of a single impurity .    in this paper",
    "we study the spin structure of the impurity band created by coulomb impurities in both two and three dimensional cases in the limit of low density of impurities . in the two - dimensional case",
    "the impurities may be located either outside or inside the plane of electron gas .",
    "we assume that all impurities are occupied by one electron . in this case",
    "we can consider the coordinates of the occupied centers as random variables without any correlations .",
    "our study of the spin structure is based upon the heisenberg hamiltonian which takes into account the spin - spin interaction of the electrons localized at different randomly distributed impurities .",

    "this problem has a long story@xcite .",

    "the ground state of the system consists of local singlets .",
    "rosso@xcite , thomas and rosso@xcite , andres _",
    "et al._@xcite used different selfoconsistent approaches to get the distribution of the excitation energies of the singlet - triplet transitions .",
    "bhatt and lee@xcite worked out a computational scaling approach which is exact at small density of impurities .",
    "they have also mentioned a drastic difference between the heisenberg and ising models .",
    "as far as we know all previous authors used simplified versions for the function @xmath9 .",
    "our paper pursues the following goals : + 1 .",
    "we analyze the existing methods to find the distribution of excitation energies and propose a new modification for one- , two- and three - dimensional cases .",
    "our approach is exact at low densities and it allows to get an approximate analytical expression for this distribution .",
    "+ 2 . to get",
    "an estimate for the energy of spin ordering one needs a reliable calculation of the coefficients @xmath10 which are defined here as @xmath11 of the singlet - triplet splitting for the two states corresponding to the impurities @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we have performed these calculations for a pair of the coulomb centers at a distance @xmath14 .",
    "the result of the computations is a function @xmath9 which is reliable at all distances from zero to infinity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider hamiltonian eq.([ham ] ) in the case of small impurity density .",
    "we show that the ground state mostly consists of independent singlets .",
    "we show that the problem of finding these singlets can be reduced to a non - trivial geometric problem .",
    "we solve it in a mean field approximation and by computer modeling .",
    "the solution of this problem gives the distribution function @xmath15 for the energies of the singlet - triplet transitions for a given function @xmath9 .",
    "in section 3 we calculate @xmath9 and its inverse function @xmath16 . for the @xmath17-case we present interpolated formulae which are based upon the results of well - known calculations for two hydrogen atoms .",
    "these calculations include analytical results for large distances@xcite , numerical calculations at intermediate distances , and known results for the singlet - triplet splitting of the he atom .",
    "similar interpolated formulae are presented for the @xmath18-case .",
    "they are based upon our original calculations given in the appendices .",
    "we present an analytical expression for @xmath9 at large distances , a numerical result for @xmath19 , and variational calculations for a `` two - dimensional he atom '' .    in the conclusion",
    "we discuss the distribution function of singlet - triplet splittings @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , and the density of free spins @xmath22 at finite temperature @xmath23 .",
    "these two functions are the final results of our paper .",
    "we find the ground state and excited states of the hamiltonian eq.([ham ] ) using the following properties of @xmath10 .    *",
    "all @xmath24 , which means an antiferromagnetic interaction . * the density of impurities @xmath25 is assumed to be small , so that the average distance between them is larger than the characteristic length of the exponential decay of @xmath10 .",
    "this means there is a very large dispersion of @xmath10 .",
    "in fact we shall assume that if @xmath26 , then @xmath27 .",
    "thus , we ignore the cases when the distance @xmath14 is very close to the distance @xmath28 , assuming that these two pairs are not very far from each other .    to understand the physics of the problem it is very helpful to consider the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) with four impurities only ( fig .",
    "from a general principle one can conclude@xcite that the energy spectrum consists of six levels , one level with spin @xmath29 , three levels with @xmath30 , and two levels with @xmath31 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath32 is much larger than all other @xmath10 in this problem .",
    "then the ground state wave function describes two singlets at sites ( 1,2 ) and ( 3,4 ) .",
    "it is easy to write the energy of the ground state and the first excited state assuming @xmath33 where the sum includes all @xmath10 except @xmath32 and @xmath34 .",
    "the ground state energy @xmath35 and the energy of the first excited state @xmath36 are given by the equations @xmath37 the physical meaning of eq .",
    "( [ en ] ) is simple .",
    "two singlets ( 1,2 ) and ( 3,4 ) do not interact with each other if condition ( [ in ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "the @xmath38 terms come from the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .    in this approximation",
    "the excitation energy is @xmath39 .",
    "the ground state has a total spin @xmath31 while the first excited state has @xmath30 .",
    "bhatt and lee@xcite take into account the next approximation for the excitation energy @xmath40 since @xmath32 is the largest term , the second term should be small .",
    "it looks like it can change the ground state from singlet to triplet if @xmath34 is unusually small .",
    "however , such configurations are extremely rare .",
    "it happens because in the case of small @xmath34 one should consider fig.1b with 6 spins rather than fig.1a .",
    "indeed , very small @xmath34 means a long distance between impurities 3 and 4 .",
    "it is more likely that in this situation some other strong singlet ( 5,6 ) is the nearest neighbor of the impurity 4 rather than the singlet ( 1,2 ) .    in this 6-spin system",
    "we have 2 strongly connected groups of spins , namely 1,2,3 and 4,5,6 .",
    "assume that @xmath32 and @xmath41 provide the strongest bonds in each group .",
    "suppose there is no interaction between the groups .",
    "then , the ground state in each of them is a degenerate doublet .",
    "altogether the system is 4-fold degenerate . if one takes into account @xmath34 the degeneracy of the ground state",
    "will be lifted .",
    "one gets a singlet and a triplet with the energy splitting @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "the general 6-spin problem can be solved assuming that both @xmath32 and @xmath41 are infinite . in this approximation one",
    "gets the same result : the ground state is a singlet and the excitation energy @xmath39 .",
    "it follows that the other bonds connecting the two groups , like @xmath43 may contribute to the excitation energy only in the second order of perturbation theory .",
    "this contribution will contain a small dimensionless coefficient like @xmath44 and it may be neglected .",
    "thus , it is not necessary to take into account the renormalization of the weak bonds due to their strong neighbors in the limit of small density .",
    "bhatt and lee also mention@xcite that their computations show the triplet ground state in very rare cases .",
    "thus , we assume that the ground state energy of any even number of impurities has @xmath31 and the system can be split into localized singlets . to find the pairs of impurities which form the singlet in the ground state we propose the following geometric problem .",
    "+ 1 . for every impurity in the system find its nearest neighbor .",
    "take the pair with the smallest distance . generally , the nearest neighbor of a site a does not have site a as its nearest neighbor .",
    "but for the closest pair this is the case .",
    "this closest pair forms a singlet with the largest binding energy . to find all other singlets remove both sites of the first pair .",
    "go to point 1 and continue until all the singlets will be found .",
    "+ the same geometric problem has been proposed by thomas and rosso@xcite for three - dimensional case .",
    "assuming that all neighboring @xmath10 are very different one can write the total energy of the lowest state in the form @xmath45 where the first sum includes all pairs which form singlets and the second one includes all other pairs .    one can prove that the distribution of singlets , obtained as a solution of the problem above , gives the minimum of total energy .",
    "suppose , for example , that the solution prescribes the configuration of singlets ( 1,2 ) , ( 3,4 ) and ( 5,6 ) , for impurities with the numbers from 1 to 6 .",
    "one can show that any other location of singlets at the same impurities , like ( 1,3 ) , ( 2,5 ) and ( 4,6 ) , has larger energy .",
    "we mention first that the contribution to the energy from all other impurities like 7,8 ... is the same at all configurations of singlets of six chosen impurities .",
    "suppose now that @xmath46 .",
    "then all other @xmath10 connecting the six impurities are also less than @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , if one of them were larger , it would be used to form a singlet instead of @xmath32 .",
    "thus , any rearrangement of the pairs within 6 impurities that destroys singlet ( 1,2 ) increases the total energy .",
    "in the same way one can show that rearrangement of singlets in the system of four impurities 3,4,5,6 also increases the total energy .",
    "the same consideration can be done for any even number of impurities .",
    "thus , the solution of the above geometric problem gives the ground state of the system .",
    "we start with the simplest mean field approximation .",
    "suppose we are at the stage where all pairs with distance less than @xmath1 are removed and we want to find the residual impurity density @xmath47 .",
    "the crucial point of the mean field approximation is that we neglect correlations in the positions of the remaining impurities except that they can not be closer to one another than @xmath1 .",
    "we start with the two - dimensional case .",
    "let us draw a circle around each impurity with the radius @xmath1 .",
    "there will be no other impurities inside the circles .",
    "now increase the radii from @xmath1 to @xmath48 and calculate how many impurities occur in the rings between @xmath1 and @xmath48 .",
    "the total number of these impurities gives the decrease of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the total area of the system .",
    "thus , one gets the equation @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the density of the impurities outside the circles .",
    "it is slightly larger than @xmath47 ( see below ) , but in the simplest mean field approximation we ignore this difference .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless coordinate @xmath54 and the normalized number of particles ( or density ) @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 is the initial concentration of particles .",
    "the differential equation for @xmath57 at @xmath58 has the form    @xmath59    the solution of this equation with the condition @xmath60 is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the two - dimensional density .",
    "similar calculations for the three- and one - dimensional cases give @xmath63 here @xmath64 at @xmath65 and @xmath66 at @xmath67 .",
    "this distribution has been obtained by rosso@xcite for @xmath65 .",
    "one can show that at small @xmath68 the above results are exact , including @xmath69-corrections .",
    "bhatt@xcite has pointed out that it is not exact at large @xmath68 .",
    "we believe that the exact distribution has a following form at large @xmath68 @xmath70 where the coefficient @xmath71 and it depends on the dimensionality of space @xmath72 .",
    "it follows from eq.([b ] ) that the average density @xmath47 is independent of @xmath73 at large values of @xmath1 and it is of the order of @xmath74 .",
    "this is because the average distance between impurities can not be smaller than @xmath1 by definition , and there are no reasons for it to be substantially larger than @xmath1 .",
    "that is why we believe that eq.([b ] ) is exact at large @xmath68 .",
    "our computer modeling confirms this point and it gives us the values @xmath75 .",
    "we propose an improved mean field approach which takes into account the fact that the density @xmath76 outside the circles is slightly larger than the average density @xmath47 , because there are no impurities inside the circles .",
    "for example , at @xmath77 , one gets @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the excluded area inside @xmath80 circles .",
    "we have introduced a free parameter @xmath81 , which takes into account the overlap of the circles .",
    "its value can be extracted from comparison with numerical computations .",
    "( [ nimpr ] ) can be generalized for any @xmath72 to get a differential equation in @xmath82 @xmath83 the solution is given by the following transcendental equation : @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that if we would neglect the `` circles '' overlapping ( @xmath86 ) , then the solution of eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) is @xmath87 which is an underestimate for large distances . in the general case , for @xmath88 , the analytical solution of the transcendental equation ( [ corr ] )",
    "can be obtained only for large and small values of @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath89    we performed computer simulations of this problem for the one- , two- and three - dimensional cases .",

    "( [ n3 ] ) . we found that fitting our numerical data using eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) shows excellent agreement if we choose @xmath90 .",
    "it would be natural to think that the simple mean field approach with @xmath91 becomes exact for large values of @xmath72 .    unfortunately , eq . ( [ corr ] )",
    "does not have an analytical solution for all @xmath68 and so it is not convenient for our purpose .",
    "we found that the simple interpolated formula @xmath92 which resembles eq.([1stappr ] ) , describes the residual density well for the whole range of distances .",
    "the comparison of this formula with the results of computer modeling is shown in fig . 2 ( b),(c),(d ) for d= 1,2,3 .",
    "below we use only eq . ( [ inrho ] ) with the values of @xmath75 obtained above .",
    "the spin - spin interaction constant is the splitting energy between the ground states for total spin @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath93 for hydrogen - like molecule , where nuclei are represented by two impurities .",
    "hereafter we use effective atomic units ( a.u . ) which means that all distances are measured in units of the effective bohr radius @xmath94 , and energies in units of @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the effective carrier mass , and @xmath97 is the dielectric constant .",
    "we propose a simple interpolated formula for the exchange constant based on the most accurate numerical calculations of the hydrogen molecule @xcite and the following asymptotic expression@xcite for large @xmath1 : @xmath98    we found @xmath99 from the data for the singlet - triplet splitting of the helium atom@xcite . @xmath100",
    "the numerical data@xcite show that the behavior of the logarithm of the exchange constant for small @xmath1 is well described by a second order polynomial .    to obtain the interpolated formula we match the second derivative of @xmath101 . in two regions",
    "it has the following behavior @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the matching constant .",
    "the simplest formula that satisfies both conditions is @xmath104 after integrating twice we obtain @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are connected by equation @xmath108 this interpolated formula has one fitting parameter @xmath107 and the correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "the parameter @xmath107 has to be chosen to match small distances in an optimal way .",
    "the least square method gives @xmath109 .",
    "the final equation is @xmath110 for further calculations we need the inverse function @xmath16 as well . because of the exponential character of the exchange constant , the inverse function depends on energy logarithmically",
    "therefore , we performed interpolation for the function @xmath111 , where @xmath112 .",
    "the result is @xmath113 the interpolated curves and all available data are shown in fig .",
    "we are unaware of any calculations of @xmath9 for the two - dimensional case .",
    "we have considered a general problem when the motion of the electrons is confined to a plane , but the coulomb impurities are at distances @xmath114 and @xmath115 outside the plane .",
    "however , in this paper only the calculations for in - plane impurities ( @xmath116 ) are presented .",
    "the results for the general case will be published elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the case of the in - plane impurities corresponds to a @xmath18 hydrogen - like molecule with the hamiltonian @xmath117    when @xmath118 the singlet - triplet splitting constant is calculated by making use the semiclassical approach @xcite ( see appendix [ apc ] ) .",
    "we obtained the following result : @xmath119 to provide the point @xmath2 we performed variational calculations for the two - dimensional helium atom .",
    "we found that ( see appendix [ aphel ] ) @xmath120    finally , we performed numerical calculations based on the method described in @xcite for the point @xmath121 . using the same method as in the @xmath17-case we get the following interpolated formulas for @xmath9 and @xmath122 :    @xmath123    these results",
    "are shown in fig . 3b .",
    "we obtained an analytical expression ( [ inrho ] ) for the dimensionless density of impurities which form singlet pairs with a distance larger than @xmath1 .",

    "therefore , at a given temperature the function @xmath128 at @xmath129 gives the density of free spins in the system which contribute to the curie susceptibility .",
