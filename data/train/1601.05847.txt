    "to understand the reasons behind the low efficiency of the lenses at 915 nm , two double wavelength blazed gratings were designed using the proposed meta - molecule scheme .",
    "one grating with a small deflection angle ( 5 degrees ) and another one with a larger angle ( 20 degrees ) were simulated at 915 nm using meep , and power loss channels were analyzed in both cases ( fig .",
    "both gratings were chosen to be 2 meta - molecules wide in the @xmath36 direction , so that periodic boundary conditions in this direction can be used in fdtd .",
    "the 5 degree grating is 322 lattice constants long in @xmath37 direction , while the 20 degree one is 146 lattice constants .",
    "the lengths are chosen such that the grating phases at 915 nm and 1550 nm are both almost repeated after the chosen lengths ( fig .",
    "an x - polarized plane - wave normally incident from the fused silica side was used as excitation in both simulations , and the transmitted and reflected electric and magnetic field intensities were calculated about a wavelength apart from the meta - molecules .",
    "the transmitted fields were further propagated using a plane wave expansion program , and the resulting fields in an area of length 30 @xmath24 m around the center can be seen in fig .",
    "s3b and s3c for 5 degree and 20 degree gratings , respectively .",
    "the field distributions outside of the areas shown here look similar to the ones shown . in both cases ,",
    "a dominant plane wave propagating in the design direction is observed , along with some distortions .",
    "angular distribution of power in transmission and reflection is analyzed using the fourier transform of the fields .",
    "the resulting power distributions are shown in fig .",
    "s3d and s3e for 5 degrees and 20 degrees , respectively . while the average power transmission of meta - molecules used in both gratings ( found from the data in fig .",
    "2 g ) is slightly above 73@xmath0 , only 36@xmath0 and 22@xmath0 of the incident power is directed to 5 and 20 degrees for the corresponding gratings .",
    "the actual total transmitted powers are 56@xmath0 and 50@xmath0 for the 5 and 20 degree gratings , showing that an additional @xmath3120@xmath0 of the power gets reflected as a result of the introduced aperiodicity . because of the relatively large lattice constant",
    ", even a small aperiodicity can result in generation of propagating modes in the substrate , thus the reflection is considerably higher for the gratings than for a perfectly periodic lattice . from",
    "the 56@xmath0 transmitted power in the 5 degree grating , 20@xmath38 is lost to diffraction to other angles . from fig .",
    "s3b and s3c we can see there are distortions in the transmitted field .",
    "these distortions , mainly due to the low transmission amplitude of some of the meta - molecules and their phase errors result in the transmitted power being diffracted to other angles .",
    "besides , it is seen that power loss to other angles both in reflection and transmission is higher for larger grating angles .",
    "this is due to the need for finer sampling of the wave front for waves with steeper angles . the lower efficiency for gratings with larger angles results in lower efficiency of lenses with higher numerical apertures which need bending light with larger angles ."

    "<S> dielectric transmitarrays  @xcite are some of the most versatile metasurfaces because they provide high transmission and subwavelength spatial control of both polarization and phase . </S>",
    "<S> several diffractive optical elements , including high numerical aperture lenses and simultaneous phase and polarization controllers have recently been demonstrated with high efficiencies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these devices are based on subwavelength arrays of high refractive index dielectric nano - resonators ( scatterers ) with different geometries , fabricated on a planar substrate . </S>",
    "<S> scatterers with various geometries impart different phases to the transmitted light , shaping its wavefront to the desired form </S>",
    "<S> .    one main drawback of almost all of metasurface devices , particularly the ones with spatially varying phase profiles like lenses and gratings , is their chromatic aberration : their performance changes as the wavelength is varied  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> refractive optical elements also suffer from chromatic aberrations ; however , their chromatic aberrations , which stem from material dispersion , are substantially smaller than those of the diffractive elements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an ideal refractive lens made of a dispersionless material will show no chromatic aberration . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the chromatic aberration of diffractive elements mainly comes from the geometrical arrangement of the device . </S>",
    "<S> early efforts focused on making achromatic diffractive lenses by cascading them in the form of doublets and triplets  @xcite , but it was later shown that it is fundamentally impossible to make a converging achromatic lens which has a paraxial solution ( i.e. is suitable for imaging ) by only using diffractive elements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although diffractive - refractive combinations have successfully been implemented to reduce chromatic aberrations , they are mostly useful in deep uv and x - ray wavelengths where materials are significantly more dispersive  @xcite . more recently , wavelength and polarization selectivity of metallic meta - atoms have been used to fabricate a fresnel zone plate lens that operates at two distinct wavelengths with different orthogonal polarizations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides undesired multi - focus property of fresnel zone plates and efficiency limitations of metallic metasurfaces  @xcite , the structure works only with different polarizations at the two wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the large phase dispersion of dielectric meta - atoms with multiple resonances has also been exploited to compensate for the phase dispersion of metasurfaces at three wavelengths  @xcite , but the cylindrical lens demonstrated with this technique is polarization dependent and has low numerical aperture and efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> multiwavelength metasurfaces based on elliptical apertures in metallic films are demonstrated in  @xcite , but they are also polarization dependent and have a multi - focus performance . an achromatic metasurface design is proposed in  @xcite based on the idea of dispersionless meta - atoms ( i.e. meta - atoms that impart constant delays ) . unfortunately , this idea only works for metasurface lenses with one fresnel zone limiting the size and numerical aperture of the lenses . for a typical lens with tens of fresnel zones , dispersionless meta - atoms will not reduce the chromatic dispersion as we will shortly discuss . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the reason for chromatic dispersion of metasurface lenses , and then propose a method for correcting this dispersion at distinct wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> we also present experimental results demonstrating corrected behavior of a lens realized using the proposed method .        </S>",
    "<S> in diffractive lenses , chromatic dispersion mainly manifests itself through a significant change of focal length as a function of wavelength  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this change is schematically shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a , along with a metasurface lens corrected to have the same focal distance at a few wavelengths . to better understand the underlying reasons for this chromatic dispersion </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a hypothetical aspherical metasurface lens . </S>",
    "<S> the lens is composed of different meta - atoms which locally modify the phase of the transmitted light to generate the desired wavefront . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the meta - atoms are dispersionless in the sense that their associated phase changes with wavelength as @xmath1 like a piece of dielectric with a constant refractive index . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is the wavelength and @xmath3 is an effective parameter associated with the meta - atoms that controls the phase ( @xmath3 can be an actual physical parameter or a function of physical parameters of the meta - atoms ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the full 2@xmath4 phase needed for the lens is covered using different meta - atoms with different values of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the lens is designed to focus light at @xmath5 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) to a focal distance @xmath6 , and it s phase profile in all fresnel zones matches the ideal phase profile at this wavelength . because of the specific wavelength dependence of the dispersionless meta - atoms ( i.e. proportionality to 1/@xmath2 ) , at a different wavelength ( @xmath7 ) the phase profile of the lens in the first fresnel zone follows the desired ideal profile needed to maintain the same focal distance ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , outside the first fresnel zone , the actual phase profile of the lens deviates substantially from the desired phase profile . due to the jumps at the boundaries between the fresnel zones , the actual phase of the lens at @xmath7 is closer to the ideal phase profile at @xmath5 than the desired phase profile at @xmath7 . in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b the effective meta - atom parameter @xmath3 is plotted as a function of distance to the center of the lens @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the jumps in @xmath3 coincide with the jumps in the phase profile at @xmath7 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c , the simulated intensity profile of the same hypothetical lens is plotted at a few wavelengths close to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the focal distance changes approximately proportional to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this wavelength dependence is also observed in fresnel zone plates  @xcite , and for lenses with wavelength independent phase profiles  @xcite ( the @xmath9 dependence is exact in the paraxial limit , and approximate in general ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior confirms the previous observation that the phase profile of the lens at other wavelengths approximately follows the phase profile at the design wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the chromatic dispersion of metasurface lenses mainly stems from wrapping the phase , and the dependence of the phase on only one effective parameter ( e.g. @xmath3 ) whose value undergoes sudden changes at the zone boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> as we show in the following , using two parameters to control metasurface phase at two wavelengths can resolve this issue , and enable lenses with the same focal lengths at two different wavelengths .        </S>",
    "<S> the metasurface platform we use in this work is based on amorphous silicon ( a - si ) nano - posts on a fused silica substrate ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nano - posts are placed on the vertices of a hexagonal lattice , and locally sample the phase to generate the desired phase profile  @xcite . for a fixed height , the transmission phase of a nano - post can be controlled by varying its diameter . </S>",
    "<S> the posts height can be chosen such that at a certain wavelength the whole 2@xmath4 phase shift is covered , while keeping the transmission amplitude high . to design a metasurface that works at two different wavelengths , a unit cell consisting of four different nano - posts ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) was chosen because it has more parameters to control the phases at two wavelengths almost independently . as molecules consisting of multiple atoms </S>",
    "<S> form the units for more complex materials , we call these unit cells with multiple meta - atoms _ meta - molecules_. the meta - molecules can also form a periodic lattice ( in this case hexagonal ) , and effectively sample the desired phase profiles simultaneously at two wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice is subwavelength at both wavelengths of interest ; therefore , the non - zero diffraction orders are not excited . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the four nano - posts can each have different diameters and distances from each other . </S>",
    "<S> however , to make the design process more tractable , we choose three of the four nano - posts with the same diameter @xmath10 and the fourth post with diameter @xmath11 , and place them in the centers of the hexagons at a distance @xmath12 ( as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , each meta - molecule has two parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , to control the phases at two wavelengths . for this demonstration , we choose two wavelengths of 1550 nm and 915 nm , because of the availability of lasers at these wavelengths . </S>",

    "<S> the focusing efficiency was found to be 32@xmath0 at 915 nm , and 73@xmath0 at 1550 nm . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the difference in the simulated and measured efficiencies to fabrication imperfections and measurement artifacts ( see methods for details about measurements ) .        the efficiency at 915 nm is found to be lower than what expected both in measurement and fdtd simulation . </S>",
    "<S> while the average power transmission of the selected meta - molecules is about 73@xmath0 as calculated from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 g , the simulated focusing efficiency is about 32@xmath0 . to better understand the reasons for this difference , two blazed gratings with different angles </S>",
    "<S> were designed and simulated for both wavelengths using the same meta - molecules ( see supplementary information section 1 and fig . </S>",
    "<S> s3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that for the gratings ( that are aperiodic ) , a significant portion of the power is diffracted to other angles both in reflection and transmission . besides , the power lost into diffractions to other angles is higher for the grating with larger deflection angle . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason for the large power loss to other angles is the the relatively large lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> the chosen lattice constant of @xmath25 720 nm is just slightly smaller than 727 nm , the lattice constant at which the first order diffracted light starts to propagate in the glass substrate for a perfectly periodic structure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even a small deviation from perfect periodicity can result in light diffracted to propagating orders . </S>",
    "<S> besides , the lower transmission of some meta - molecules reduces the purity of the plane wave wavefronts diffracted to the design angle . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the desired phase profile of high numerical aperture lenses can not be sampled at high enough resolution using large lattice constants . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as shown in this work , a lens with a lower numerical aperture has a higher efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> there are a few methods to increase the efficiency of the lenses at 915 nm : the lattice constant is bound by the geometrical and fabrication constraint : @xmath26 , hence the smallest value of @xmath27 that gives full phase coverage at the longer wavelength sets the lower bound for the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> this limit can usually be decreased by using taller posts , however , that would result in a high sensitivity to fabrication errors at the shorter wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a compromise should be made here , and higher efficiency designs might be possible by more optimum selections of the posts height and the lattice constant </S>",
    "<S> . the lattice constant can also be smaller if less than the full 2@xmath4 phase shift is used at 1550 nm ( thus lower efficiency at 1550 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as explained earlier , in minimizing the total transmission error equal weights are used for 915 nm and 1550 nm . a higher weight for 915 nm might result in higher efficiency at this wavelength , probably at the expense of 1550 nm efficiency . for instance , if we optimize the lens only for operation at 915 nm , devices with efficiencies as high as 80@xmath0 are possible  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the approach presented here can not be directly used to correct for chromatic dispersion over a continuous bandwidth ; the multiwavelength lenses still have chromatic dispersion much like normal metasurface lenses in narrow bandwidths around the corrected wavelengths . for achieving zero chromatic dispersion over a narrow bandwidth </S>",
    "<S> , the meta - atoms should independently control the phase at two very close wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> high quality factor resonances must be present for the meta - atom phase to change rapidly over a narrow bandwidth , and such resonances will result in high sensitivities to fabrication errors that would make the metasurface impractical .    </S>",
    "<S> the meta - molecule platform , used here to correct for chromatic aberration at specific wavelengths , can also be used for applications where different functionalities at different wavelengths are desired . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it can be used to implement a lens with two given focal distances at two wavelengths , or a lens converging at one wavelength and diverging at the other . </S>",
    "<S> multi - wavelength operation is necessary in various microscopy applications where fluorescence is excited at one wavelength and collected at another . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we have used only two of the degrees of freedom of the meta - molecules , but increased functionalities at more than two wavelengths can be achieved by making use of all the degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> operation at more than two wavelengths enables applications in color display technologies or more complex fluorescence imaging techniques . </S>"
