    "it is well known that the wave propagation behaviors in anisotropic media are significantly different from those in isotropic materials  @xcite . in general , anisotropic media exhibit a polarization - sensitive effect , namely te and tm polarized waves present different characteristics which depend on the polarization . here",
    "we are particularly interested in the case that one polarized wave exhibit total refraction , while the other present total reflection .",
    "furthermore , we will discuss that the two polarized waves experience an opposite amphoteric refraction , such as polarized wave performs negative refraction , while the other undergoes positive refraction .",
    "first we explore the two polarized waves show anomalous total refraction or total reflection . without loss of generality , we assume the wave vector locate at the @xmath7 plane ( @xmath19 ) .",
