    "the allen brain atlas ( aba , @xcite ) put neuroanatomy on a genetic basis by releasing voxelized , _ in situ _ hybridization data for the expression of the entire genome in the mouse brain ( ) .",

    "however , for a given cell characterized in this way , it is not known where other cells of the same type are located in the brain .",
    "a linear model was proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and used to estimate the region - specificity of cell types by linear regression with positivity constraint .",
    "the model was fitted using the coronal aba only , which allowed to obtain brain - wide results . however",
    ", this restriction implies that only one ish expression profile per gene was used to fit the model .",
    "this poses the problem of the error bars on the results of the model .",
    "since all the ish data in the aba were co - registered to the voxelized ara , so that data for the sagittal and coronal atlas can be treated computationally in the same way .",
    "however , the aba does not specify from which cell type(s ) the expression of each gene comes . + * gene expression energies from the allen brain atlas .",
    "* in the aba , the adult mouse brain is partitioned into @xmath1 cubic voxels of side 200 microns , to which ish data are registered @xcite for thousands of genes . for computational purposes , these gene - expression data can be arranged into a voxel - by - gene matrix . for a cubic labeled @xmath2 , the _ expression energy _",

    "the values of the cell - type - specific density profiles were computed in @xcite by minimizing the value of the residual term over all the ( positive ) density profiles , which amounts to solving a quadratic optimization problem ( with positivity constraint ) at each voxel .",
    "these computations can be reproduced on a desktop computer using the matlab toolbox ( bgea ) @xcite . for other applications of the toolbox see @xcite ( marker genes of brain regions ) , @xcite for co - expression properties of some autism - related genes , and @xcite for computations of stereotactic coordinates ) .",
    "the optimization procedure in our model is deterministic . on the other hand ,",
    "decomposing the density of a cell type into the sum of its mean and gaussian noise is a difficult statistics problem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "some error estimates on the value of @xmath11 were obained in @xcite using sub - sampling techniques ( i.e. sub - sampling the data repeatedly by keeping only a random 10% of the coronal aba ) .",
    "this induced a ranking of the cell types based on the stability of the results against sub - sampling .",

    "the restriction to the left hemisphere comes from the use we made of sagittal image series , which cover the left hemisphere only.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    in the present work we simulated the variability of the spatial density of cell types by integrating the digitized sagittal image series into the data set . for gene labeled @xmath3 ,",
    "the aba provides @xmath13 expression profiles , where @xmath13 is the number of image series in the aba for this gene .",
    "hence , instead of just one voxel - by - gene matrix , the aba gives rise to a family of @xmath14 voxel - by - gene matrices , with voxels belonging to the left hemisphere .",

    "it is optically very similar to the ( left ) striatum , which allows the model to predict that medium spiny neurons are specific to the striatum ( which confirms prior neurobiological knowledge and therefore serves as a proof of concept for the model ) .",

    "for most cell types , this confirms the ranking of cell types by stability obtained in @xcite , but based on error bars obtained from the same set of genes in every fitting of the model ( see the accompanying preprint @xcite for exhaustive results for all cell types in the panel ) .",
