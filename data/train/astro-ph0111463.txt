    "arguably the most important advance in recent research of active galaxies has been the development of unified models ( e.g. antonucci 1993 ) , where a thick molecular torus surrounds the nucleus . in seyfert 1 ( sy1 )",
    "galaxies the nucleus and the broad line region ( blr ) are directly visible , while in seyfert 2 ( sy2 ) galaxies the torus obscures the nucleus and the blr and only the narrow line region ( nlr ) is visible .",
    "these models are supported by the detection in many sy2s of broad lines in polarized emission ( e.g. moran et al .",
    "2000 ) , believed to be light from the blr reflected into our line - of - sight , and cone - like structures in narrow - band images ( e.g. mulchaey , wilson & tsvetanov 1996 ) almost invariably aligned with the radio jets .",
    "searches for the obscuring molecular material associated with the torus have mostly been carried out at millimeter wavelengths ( e.g. maiolino et al . 1997 ) , and consequently they generally give only the total molecular content in the nucleus .",
    "better spatial resolution , and therefore smaller contamination from any circumnuclear star formation , can be achieved by observing in the near - infrared ( nir ; e.g. veilleux , goodrich & hill 1997 ) , where in addition to the molecular h@xmath1 lines a wealth of other emission and absorption lines are available .",
    "however , the nir spectroscopic studies have mostly been made at moderate spatial resolution ( @xmath415 ) .",
    "only recently have better resolution nir studies been carried out ( e.g. storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "1999 , winge et al .",
    "2000 ) , but even these studies have only one slit position angle ( pa ) along either the radio axis or the major axis of inner isophotes in images , and thus can not derive the geometry of the molecular emission .",
    "in this paper we present the results of long - slit 1.52.5 @xmath0 m moderate resolution spectroscopy of the first six galaxies in our sample of nearby ( 500 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath5 1500 km s@xmath7 ) seyfert galaxies of both types with an ionization cone and/or jets .",
    "the slit was positioned both perpendicular and parallel to the ionization cone or to the jet in order to probe the distribution of the molecular material and thus the geometry of the torus .",
    "additionally , broad - band @xmath8-images are available for all the galaxies .",
    "these data are used to trace the spatial distribution , dynamics and excitation of molecular and nebular gas , and to determine the mass of hot ( @xmath9 k ) molecular gas in the central regions .",
    "in forthcoming publications , we shall discuss the implications from the emission line study of all the 14 seyferts in our sample , and study the stellar populations and star forming histories of the sample , based on the absorption lines , and comparison with non - seyfert spirals .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 the observations , data reduction and methods used in the analysis are outlined . in section 3",
    "the galaxies are discussed individually , and in section 4 we present our preliminary conclusions . throughout this paper , @xmath10 = 75 mpc@xmath7 and @xmath11",

    "six nearby active galaxies were observed in january 1999 with the 3.6 m eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) using the 1024@xmath121024 px sofi camera ( lidman , cuby & vanzi 2000)and a pixel scale 029 px@xmath7 .",
    "the best , average and worst seeing during the observations were 065 , @xmath1310 and 135 , respectively . in the spectroscopic observations",
    "the red grism with resolution @xmath14 and slit width 10 ( 06 for ngc 1386 ) were used .",

    "the images were then flatfielded using dome flats .",
    "bad pixels were masked out and any remaining cosmic rays were removed manually .",
    "the images were wavelength calibrated using either oh night sky lines or xe arc lamp calibration frames .",
    "the nucleus was traced by fitting a low order polynomial , a strip was extracted , and the strips were averaged to erase the residual continuum and oh lines from the sky .",
    "finally , the images were divided by an atmospheric standard star , flux calibrated and averaged .",
    "iraf was used for all stages of the data reduction .",
    "the accurate determination of fluxes and line widths requires a good s / n ratio , and therefore two or more pixels were binned together .",
    "however , the sizes given later for the nuclear sources are based on unbinned data . in order to probe the nuclear region",
    "as deeply as possible , all the spectra of a given galaxy were combined and the central 15 ( 5 px ) spectrum was extracted . as a result of this and the slit width ( 10 or 06 ) , the effective aperture has a diameter of 14 or 11 .",
    "the fluxes and widths of the lines detected in this aperture are given in table [ nucflux ] .",
    "for few lines , especially for in ngc 1386 , an outlaying region with no line emission was subtracted to remove the underlaying absorption lines .",
    "the quoted errors in the following sections are generally dominated by the continuum fitting , and are 1@xmath20 except 3@xmath20 for upper limits .",
    "we have estimated the extinction by comparing the observed integrated colours from the spectra with the colours of normal , unobscured spiral galaxies ( @xmath21-@xmath22 = 0.22 , hunt et al .",
    "1997 ) , as the @xmath21-@xmath22 color of s0 or e galaxies resemble the color of spiral galaxies ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1999 ) .",
    "we note that the extinction based on continuum colours or the slope of the spectra may not be correct for the line emission .",
    "however , no useful line pairs were generally detected . only in ngc 4945 the br@xmath23 and br@xmath24 lines",
    "are visible in a few regions and the extinction based on them is similar to that derived from the continuum colours of the spectra .",
    "the difficulty of detecting other lines arises from the high extinction these galaxies suffer , the intrinsic weakness of the lines and/or the contamination from nearby absorption lines .",
    "we have assumed the extinction law @xmath25 ( landini et al .",
    "1984 ) and a foreground dust screen .",
    "the extinction is given in table [ nucflux ] for the central region and in the lowest panel of the spatial profile figures .",
    "our extinction measurements are in fairly good agreement with the previous derivations : e.g. in ngc 4945 marconi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) derived @xmath26 from the continuum colors and @xmath27 in the pa@xmath28 ring .",
    "the observed colors are also in agreement with previous measurements ( e.g. @xmath21-@xmath22 = 0.34 kotilainen et al . 2000 ; here 0.37 ) .",
    "in addition to the hydrogen recombination lines , lines can be used to estimate the extinction . a useful line pair in the 1.5 - 2.5",
    "@xmath0 m range is 1.5339 and 1.6773 @xmath0 m , which originate from the same @xmath29d@xmath30 level .",
    "these faint emission lines are detected in ngc 1386 , ngc 1566 , ngc 3227 and ngc 5128 , as marked in the respective figures .",
    "however , the lines are generally much broader and more extended than the main 1.64 @xmath0 m line .",
    "for this reason , they have not been used in the analysis .",
    "these features are not artificial or telluric as the velocity field derived from them agrees with the general rotation of the galaxies .",
    "the emission line ratios can be used to probe the excitation mechanisms of the interstellar matter .",
    "sources of line emission can roughly be divided into three classes : cool or warm molecular clouds ( 2 lines ) , warm ionized interstellar gas ( lines , , ) and very hot , highly ionized matter near the centre of the galaxies ( coronal lines ) .",
    "the main mechanisms for the 2 emission are thermal ( collisional ) heating and uv pumping ( fluorescence ) .",
    "thermal excitation , either by shocks ( e.g. hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) , by uv radiation in dense ( @xmath31 ) clouds ( sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ) or by x - rays ( e.g. gredel & dalgarno 1995 ) , is preferred as the dominant mechanism in most extragalactic sources .    the h@xmath1 line ratio 21 s(1)/10 s(1 ) is commonly used to distinguish between thermal ( @xmath130.10.2 ) and uv ( @xmath130.55 ) excitation in low density regions .",
    "interpretation of the h@xmath1 21 s(1)/10 s(1 ) ratio is somewhat hampered , if x - rays play a significant role in the excitation of the molecular gas ( maloney , hollenbach & tielens 1996 ) .",

    "the equation for the mass of the excited molecular hydrogen can be derived assuming @xmath36 = 2000 k , the 10 s(1 ) transition probability @xmath37 = 3.47 @xmath12 10@xmath38 s@xmath7 ( turner et al .",

    "integrated masses were derived for all pas ( table [ tablederi ] ) .",
    "since the effective length of the slit is @xmath132 , the slit covers most of the galaxy and the inclination effect is negligible .",
    "we have also determined the average surface density and the mass of the excited 2 in the nucleus . as our nuclear aperture is not significantly larger than the seeing , the average surface density",
    "can then be used to compare the amount of molecular material between sy1s and sy2s .",

    "the highest nuclear gas densities @xmath3 are found in the sy2s ngc 4945 and ngc 5128 , and the lowest in the sy1s ngc 1097 and ngc 1566 . in the sy1.5 ngc 3227",
    "the density is intermediate , while in the sy2 ngc 1386 the density is comparable to that in the sy1s .    in all galaxies , the dominant excitation mechanism of the nuclear 2 emission appears to be due to shocks .",
