    "the first sources of ionizing radiation in our universe transformed the cold and neutral cosmic gas that was present shortly after the big bang into the hot and ionized plasma that we observe in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) today .",
    "research into this transformation , which took place in the first billion years , during the epoch of reionization , is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies , including our own galaxy , the milky way ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a number of new telescopes are currently being developed or are already underway to unravel the astrophysics of these early times , including the _ low frequency array _ ( lofar ; e.g. , @xcite ) , the _ murchison widefield array _ ( mwa ; e.g. , @xcite ) , the _ square kilometer array _",
    "( ska ; e.g. , @xcite ) , the _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ; e.g. , @xcite ) , and many others ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these investments at the observational frontier have spurred the construction of models of the early universe to guide the design of observational campaigns and to help interpret the observations once the data arrives .",
    "most of the current models are built on the observationally supported notion that reionization is driven mainly by star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a natural implication of these models is a strong coupling between reionization and galaxy formation caused by ionizing radiative feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "photoionization heating by star - forming galaxies typically raises the temperature in the reionized gas to a few times @xmath3 .",
    "the associated increase in gas pressure increases the jeans scale , i.e. , the scale below which pressure prevents the collapse of gas into gravitationally bound objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this boils gas out of low - mass dark matter ( dm ) haloes and impedes the accretion of gas from the igm onto them ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "photoheating therefore leads to a reduction in the fuel from which stars form , which lowers the star formation rates ( sfrs ) and the ionizing emissivities of low - mass galaxies .",
    "this makes it more difficult for galaxies to reionize the igm and , therefore , photoheating provides a negative feedback on reionization .",
    "photoheating also provides a positive feedback on reionization .",
    "the increase in the gas pressure and jeans mass smooths density fluctuations in the igm .",
    "this decreases the gas clumping factor , @xmath4 , where the angular brackets indicate the average in the igm , and @xmath5 is the cosmic mean hydrogen density ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "because the rate at which the igm recombines is proportional to the gas clumping factor ( e.g. , @xcite ) , photoheating decreases the igm recombination rate .",
    "fewer ionizing photons are then needed to keep the gas ionized , which facilitates reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this positive feedback from photoheating will be especially strong if x - ray sources preheat the gas before it is reionized ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the feedback from photoheating may be accompanied by feedback from the explosion of stars as supernovae ( sne ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "sne are thought to suppress star formation in low - mass galaxies by expelling gas in winds , which makes it more difficult for galaxies to reionize the igm .",
    "however , the ejection of gas may open additional low - density channels through which ionizing photons may escape the ism more easily , thus making it easier for galaxies to reionize the igm ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the suppression of star formation by sne may be amplified in a nonlinear manner by the feedback from photoheating ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "locally , sne may also increase the rates at which stars form as interstellar gas is compressed to star - forming densities in colliding sn shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the wide range of possibilities by which star formation may feed back on the formation of structure and the reionization of the igm makes modelling reionization a challenging task .",
    "cosmological simulations are generally considered to be among the most powerful techniques to investigate the impact of stellar feedback on reionization and galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , but are also computationally highly demanding .",
    "a principal computational challenge is the required large dynamic range .",
    "the characteristic size of individual ionized regions is of order 10 comoving mpc ( cmpc ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the redshift at which these regions percolate to reionize the universe shows spatial fluctuations due to the modulation of galaxy formation by structure formation modes on still larger scales , of order @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the concurrent need to resolve the jeans mass in the igm as well as the population of atomically cooling galaxies with masses above @xmath7 , the prime candidates for driving reionization , extends the spectrum of relevant scales down to a few kpc , and less ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    a second computational challenge is the large expense of the radiative transfer ( rt ) of ionizing photons .",
    "a straightforward and accurate treatment of the rt consists of tracing photons from each ionizing source along straight rays , one source at a time ( for an overview of rt methods see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the computational cost of such approaches therefore increases linearly with the number of ionizing sources .",
    "this renders simulations of cosmological volumes that contain large numbers of sources computationally demanding .",
    "the issue becomes particular severe if the ionizing radiation from recombining ions needs to be treated accurately ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the high cost of ray - based rt methods has triggered the development of moment - based rt methods that are computationally less expensive , but also less accurate ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to simplify the problem",
    ", cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation often assume the gas to be in ionization equilibrium with a spatially uniform ionizing background ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such simulations enable the investigation of the response of the gas in galaxies and the igm to heating by ionizing photons at relatively low computational cost , but must assume the redshift at which the ionizing background is instantaneously turned on .",
    "the main drawbacks of such simulations are that they do not yield insights in the timing and morphology of reionization , and that fluctuations in the intensity due to local sources ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the ability of the gas to throw shadows and self - shield ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) are ignored .",
    "sometimes , self - shielding is approximately accounted for by setting the intensity of the ionizing background to zero at densities above which the gas is expected to be neutral in the absence of local sources ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "other simulations focus on the accurate treatment of the rt of ionizing photons at the expense of a detailed treatment of the feedback from radiative heating ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this type of simulations ,",
    "the computational complexity is reduced by computing the rt and the evolution of structure separately , ignoring the impact of photoionization heating on the dynamics and distribution of the gas . often , to simplify the problem further , the dynamics of the gas is ignored altogether and assumed to trace that of the dm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a semi - analytical model then specifies the location of the galaxies and the rates at which these galaxies form stars .",
    "sometimes , the semi - analytical model is calibrated to approximately account for the radiation - hydrodynamical response to photoheating ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the most direct but also computationally most expensive way to investigate the coupling of reionization and galaxy formation ,",
    "is to carry out three - dimensional cosmological radiation - hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "several of these simulations now exist , including the pioneering works by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , even after more than a decade of intense research , the field is still in its infancy .",
    "radiation - hydrodynamical simulations have only very recently begun to approach the cosmological scales and the high resolution needed to capture the relevant physics ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most earlier radiation - hydrodynamical simulations of reionization were restricted to relatively small volumes that are less representative of the cosmological mean ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . only some simulations afforded ray - based rt methods that ensure the accurate propagation of ionization fronts in inhomogeneous density fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of simulations employed the computationally less expensive but also numerically diffusive moment - based rt methods ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in some cases , the computational expense needed to be reduced further by lowering the spatial resolution at which the rt is carried out , thus requiring a sub - resolution model for the propagation and consumption of photons at hydrodynamically resolved scales ( @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we present radiation - hydrodynamical simulations of reionization in cosmological volumes at high spatially adaptive resolution , implementing accurate rt using the traphic code ( @xcite ) .",
    "traphic solves the time - dependent rt equation by tracing photon packets at the speed of light and in a photon - conserving manner through the simulation box .",
    "traphic thus enables an accurate treatment of shadows and self - shielding .",
    "the photon packets are transported directly on the spatially adaptive , unstructured grid defined by the sph particles , thus exploiting the full dynamic range of the hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "the large number of ionizing sources typical of these simulations does not pose a problem because traphic employs a photon packet merging technique that renders the computational cost of the rt independent of the number of sources .",
    "traphic is implemented in the galaxy formation code gadget ( last described in @xcite ) , and this enables us to account for the radiation - hydrodynamical feedback from star formation and reionization .",
    "we focus our investigations on the roles of radiative heating ( which we also refer to as photoheating ) and sne in shaping the sfr and reionization history in the physically motivated and observationally supported models of the early universe that our simulations provide .",
    "it is currently not feasible to provide an ab initio description of the internal structure of galaxies in cosmological volumes , even in substantially less expensive simulations in which the detailed transfer of ionizing photons is ignored ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "simulations like ours therefore rely on sub - resolution models of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "this introduces free parameters that require careful calibration , e.g. , using zoomed simulations that achieve a higher resolution by focusing on a smaller computational volume , or observations .",
    "the two main parameters relevant to simulations of galaxy formation during reionization are the fraction @xmath8 of the energy released in sne and other unresolved stellar evolution processes that is available to heat the ism , and the fraction @xmath9 of the ionizing photons that escapes the unresolved ism and are available to reionize the gas .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sim ] we describe our numerical techniques and the set of simulations we have carried out . in section  [ sec : results ] we describe our results .",
    "we start in section  [ sec : reionization ] with an overview of the simulations and a comparison with observational constraints .",
    "this is continued in section  [ sec : feedback ] and extended by an analysis of the impact of stellar feedback on galaxy formation and reionization . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of our results to variations in physical parameters as well as some of the main limitations inherent to our numerical approach . in section  [ sec : summary ]",
    "we conclude with a brief summary .",

    "the simulations are initialized at redshift @xmath11 .",
    "initial particle positions and velocities are obtained by applying the zeldovich approximation ( zeldovich 1970 ) to particles arranged along a uniform grid of glass - like structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use a transfer function for matter perturbations generated with camb ( @xcite ) and apply it to describe perturbations in both the dark matter and the gaseous components .",
    "we adopt the @xmath12cdm cosmological model with parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these parameters are consistent with the most recent constraints from observations of the cosmic microwave background by the _ planck _ satellite ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our reference simulation utilizes @xmath19 dm and gas particles in a box of size @xmath20 .",
    "this implies a dm particle mass of @xmath21 and a gas particle mass of @xmath22 .",

    "we apply a comoving plummer - equivalent gravitational softening length , @xmath26 , equal to 1/25 of the mean dm particle separation to both dm and baryonic particles , i.e. , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the number of dm particles .",
    "sph quantities are estimated by averaging inside a sphere containing @xmath29 neighboring gas particles and adopting the entropy conserving formulation of sph ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sph kernel , i.e. , the radius of this sphere , is prevented from falling below @xmath30 .      while our simulations account for the thermal feedback from the explosion of massive stars as core - collapse sne ( see section  [ sec : sn ] ) , for simplicity , we do not follow the ejection and transport of metals .",
    "we therefore follow the non - equilibrium chemistry and radiative cooling of the gas , assuming that the gas is of primordial composition .",
    "molecule formation is assumed to be suppressed by the lyman - werner background expected to pervade the universe soon after the formation of the first stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , a process not resolved in our simulations .",
    "our simulations thus ignore that molecular hydrogen may form in self - shielded regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider all relevant atomic radiative cooling processes , using the rate coefficients in @xcite : cooling by collisional ionization , collisional excitation of atomic lines , the emission of free - free and recombination radiation , and compton cooling by the cmb .",
    "the species fractions and the gas temperature are advanced in time using the explicit subcycling time integration scheme presented in @xcite .",
    "once stars form and emit radiation , the chemical and thermal evolution of the gas is also affected by photoionization and photoheating , and by the injection of energy by sne , as we describe below .",
    "solving for the chemistry and cooling of the gas is by far the most expensive operation in our simulations . to speed up the calculations and unless otherwise noted , we set @xmath31 , i.e. , we neglect helium . in section",
    "[ sec : parameters ] , we will describe a preliminary comparison with a simulation in which we follow the radiative heating and cooling by helium assuming @xmath32 .",
    "our simulations do not have sufficient resolution and do not capture the physics required to describe the multiple phases of the dense gas in galaxies that are expected to develop above densities @xmath33 ( e.g. , @xcite ) as observed in the local universe .",
    "we therefore employ a subgrid model to describe the thermodynamics of the dense gas , imposing a pressure floor @xmath34 on gas with densities @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , normalized to @xmath37 at the critical density @xmath38 .",
    "we use @xmath39 for which both the jeans mass and the ratio of the jeans length and the sph kernel of gas at the pressure floor are independent of the density , thus preventing spurious fragmentation due to a lack of numerical resolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . note that , unlike in simulations that impose a polytropic equation of state , in our simulations , gas with densities above the critical density can have pressure above the pressure floor .",
    "our implementation follows @xcite and @xcite , to which we refer the reader for further details . in our simulations adopting a hydrogen mass fraction @xmath40 , we use a critical density higher than @xmath38 by a factor @xmath41 to facilitate comparisons with simulations in which @xmath32 .",
    "we employ the star formation implementation of @xcite , to which we refer the reader for details .",
    "briefly , gas with densities @xmath42 and temperatures @xmath43 is allowed to form stars using a pressure - dependent rate that reproduces the kennicutt - schmidt relation observed in the local universe ( @xcite ) in idealized simulations of isolated disk galaxies , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the sfr surface density and @xmath46 the gas surface density .",
    "the last equation has already been renormalized by a factor of @xmath47 to account for the fact that it assumes the @xcite imf whereas we are using a chabrier imf .",
    "this conversion factor between sfrs has been computed using the @xcite population synthesis code for model galaxies of age @xmath48 forming stars at a constant rate and is insensitive to metallicity .",
    "we set @xmath49 and use @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the density - dependent temperature implied by the pressure floor below which particles are prevented from cooling .",
    "moreover , to avoid numerical artefacts at high redshifts when the cosmological mean gas density is high , we require a minimum overdensity of 57.7 for gas to be allowed to form stars .",
    "the star formation law is interpreted stochastically , and the probability that a star - forming gas particle is turned into a star particle in a time interval @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the gas consumption time .",
    "gas particles are converted to star particles assuming a conversion efficiency of 100% , i.e. , the masses of the star particles are identical to those of the gas particles from which they are formed . at higher resolution ,",
    "star formation and the associated feedback may be more extended in time and in space .",
    "this may affect the impact of star formation on the gas and therefore alter , e.g. , the resolved escape fraction of ionizing photons .",
    "we interpret the star particles as simple stellar populations , i.e. , coeval stellar clusters that are characterized by an initial mass function ( imf ) , metallicity , and age .",
    "we compute the time - dependent hydrogen ionizing luminosities of these star formation bursts using the population synthesis models of @xcite .",
    "since @xcite does not tabulate ionizing luminosities for the chabrier imf , which is the imf used by our star formation recipe , we adopt the ionizing luminosities of the @xcite models with salpeter initial mass function in the range @xmath55 and metallicity @xmath56 .",
    "this yields ionizing luminosities close to those of stellar populations drawn from a chabrier imf in the range @xmath57 with subsolar metallicity @xmath58 and is consistent with the imf used in our star formation recipe and appropriate for stellar populations at @xmath59 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we multiply the luminosities of each star particle by the sub - resolution escape fraction @xmath60 to model the removal of photons due to absorption in the unresolved ism .",
    "some previous works that carried out rt simulations of reionization have calibrated the ism escape fraction to yield reionization histories in agreement with current observational constraints ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , as we will discuss below , the interpretation of these constraints is subject to substantial systematic uncertainties and limited by our incomplete understanding of the physical processes at play .",
    "we therefore prefer to set @xmath61 , and use our simulations to explore the dependence of the reionization history on box size and resolution . in section  [ sec : parameters ] , we will briefly discuss the impact of variations away from @xmath61 on our results .",
    "we use the rt code traphic @xcite to transport ionizing photons .",
    "traphic solves the time - dependent rt equation in sph simulations by tracing photon packets emitted by source particles through the simulation box in a photon - conserving manner .",
    "the photon packets are transported directly on the spatially adaptive set of sph particles and hence the rt exploits the full dynamic range of the hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "a directed transport of the photon packets radially away from the sources is accomplished despite the irregular distribution of sph particles by guiding the photon packets inside cones .",
    "a photon packet merging technique renders the computational cost of the rt independent of the number of radiation sources . in the following ,",
    "we provide a brief overview of traphic in order to motivate the meaning of the numerical parameters of the rt specified below .",
    "the reader is referred to the descriptions in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for further discussion .",
    "the transport of radiation starts with the emission of photon packets by star particles in @xmath62 tessellating emission cones .",
    "the photons in each photon packet are shared among the @xmath63 neighboring sph particles residing in the cones . in cones containing zero neighbors , an additional",
    ", so - called virtual particle is inserted to which the photon packet is assigned .",
    "star particles emit photons using emission time steps @xmath64 , in between which the orientation of the cones is randomly changed to increase the sampling of the volume with photons .",
    "the spectrum of the emitted radiation is discretized using @xmath65 frequency bins , and each photon packet carries photons from one of these bins .",
    "therefore , the number of photon packets emitted per emission time step is @xmath66 .",
    "the newly emitted photons are assigned a propagation direction parallel to the central axis of the associated emission cone , and , together with any other photon in the simulation box , are then propagated to the downstream neighbors of the sph particle at which they reside . a particle is a downstream neighbor if it is among the @xmath67 neighboring gas particles and resides in the regular transmission cone centred on the propagation direction and subtending a solid angle of @xmath68 .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 defines the angular resolution of the rt .",
    "if there is no downstream neighbor inside a transmission cone , a virtual particle is created to which the photons are then propagated .",
    "the transmission cones confine the propagation of photons to the solid angle in which they were originally emitted .",
    "the transport of photons occurs at the user - specified speed @xmath70 and is discretized using rt time steps @xmath71 .",
    "a given sph particle may receive several photon packets within the same rt time step @xmath71 .",
    "these photon packets are collected according to their propagation directions using a set of @xmath72 tessellating reception cones .",
    "photon packets whose propagation directions fall in the same reception cone are merged and replaced by a single new photon packet .",
    "each reception cone subtends a solid angle @xmath73 . hence",
    ", the parameter @xmath72 determines the angular resolution of the merging . in the absence of virtual particles , the merging strictly limits the maximum number of photon packets in the simulation box to @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the number of sph particles , and renders the computation time independent of the number of sources .",
    "note that the angular resolution at which photon packets are merged may be chosen independently of the angular resolution at which photon packets are transferred .",
    "photons are absorbed as they propagate through the gas from sph particles to their neighbors depending on the optical depth between the two neighboring particles , respecting photon conservation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the comparison with the total sfr density suggests that current observations uncover only a fraction of stars forming at @xmath112 .",

    "the total sfr is slightly smaller in the reference simulation than in the low - res simulation , and slightly larger than in the high - res simulation .",
    "this inversion in the dependence on resolution is caused by the stronger suppression of star formation by stellar feedback at higher resolution .",

    "sne have a significant impact already at early times , @xmath133 , long before the igm in the simulation is substantially ionized .",
    "on the other hand , the impact of photoheating becomes noticeable only at @xmath134 , when the average ionized fraction approaches unity .",
    "the belated impact of photoheating on the sfr suggests a stronger role of suppression of star formation due to the illumination of galaxies by the ionizing background than due to the exposure to local ionizing radiation from stars inside the galaxies .",
    "however , the impact of photoheating on the cosmic sfr remains comparatively small also after reionization .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] also shows that photoheating suppresses star formation more strongly in the simulation with sne than in the one without sne ( compare the difference between the two solid curves with the difference between the two dashed curves ) . on the other hand , sne suppress star formation more strongly in the simulation with photoheating than in that without ( compare the difference between the two blue curves with the difference between the two red curves ) . photoheating and",

    "in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig5 ] we investigate how feedback impacts the uv luminosity function , where we focus for simplicity on a single characteristic redshift @xmath141 .",
    "the comparison of the reference simulation with simulation l25n512-nofb , in which both photoheating and sne are turned off , shows that suppression of star formation by stellar feedback is a critical element of simulations that attempt to match the observed sfr function . in our reference simulation , reionization heating and sne suppress star formation at nearly complementary scales .",
    "the sfr function in simulation l25n512-nosn , in which only sne are turned off and which serves to demonstrate the isolated impact of photoheating , approaches that in simulation l25n512-nofb at sfrs @xmath142 . on the other hand , the sfr function in simulation l25n512-noph , in which only photoheating is turned off and which serves to demonstrate the isolated impact of sne , approaches that in simulation l25n512-nofb at sfrs @xmath143 .",
    "the inefficiency of photoheating at high sfrs is expected if sfrs correlate positively with halo mass , as is the case in our simulations ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) , since reionization affects mostly the gas in low - mass haloes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the decreased efficiency of sn feedback at low sfrs is likely a numerical artefact of the limited resolution .",
    "indeed , we show in appendix  [ app1 ] that in galaxies with low sfrs , star formation is more strongly suppressed by sne at higher resolution .",
    "note that our simulations also likely underestimate the local impact of photoheating by stars , especially in the lowest - mass star - forming galaxies ( @xcite ) , thus likely raising the relative importance of photoionization by the cosmological background .",

    "this can be understood by noting that the rate at which the sn heated gas cools and loses energy depends on resolution ( eq .  17 in @xcite ) . at higher resolution",
    ", the sn heated gas can maintain a high ratio of the local radiative cooling time and the sound - crossing time across a resolution element , a requirement for efficient feedback , out to higher densities , increasing the ability of the sn heated gas to prevent the formation of new stars . because at higher resolution , the gas fraction in low - mass haloes is more strongly reduced by stellar feedback ,",
    "also the hierarchically assembling larger - mass haloes grow systematically more baryon - deficient as resolution is increased ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the differences between the simulated and observed sfr functions in the high - res and low - res simulations may be reduced by increasing or lowering the fraction @xmath144 of the energy each sn injects .",
    "this would be reasonable since our simulations lack the resolution and the physics that is needed to accurately model the radiative losses in the ism .",
    "this strategy would enable one to investigate numerical convergence in simulations that reproduce observational constraints on star formation independent of resolution ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the current set of simulations , on the other hand , highlights the dependence on resolution of the sn energy fraction required to match observational constraints on star formation .",
    "this dependence demonstrates clearly that current cosmological simulations have limited power in predicting the properties of star - forming galaxies from first principles .",
    "note however , that the difference in the simulated and observed sfr functions is relatively small , of the order of the difference introduced by uncertainties in the conversion between uv luminosities and sfrs ( see discussions in , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the agreement between simulated and observed sfr functions is still very good .",
    "finally , we investigate the dependence on box size .",
    "the reference simulation overpredicts the abundance of the most intense star - forming galaxies in comparison with observations .",
    "this is likely due to the finite size of the box , which biases estimates of the abundance of the most massive and therefore rarest galaxies .",
    "the comparison with the small and large box simulations l12n256 and l50n512 supports box size as a limiting factor in accurate determinations of the sfr function at the highest sfrs .",
    "additional processes that may impact models of the sfr function at high sfrs include feedback from massive black holes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , which we have ignored here , and obscuration by dust ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . while we compare to observations of dust - corrected sfrs , there are large systematic uncertainties in the amount of dust as well as its properties , especially at the high redshifts of interest here ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is also important to keep in mind that observational estimates of the sfr function are subject to cosmic variance ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the reduction of the sfrs of low - mass galaxies due to photoheating may affect the slope of the sfr function at low sfrs .",
    "several ( semi- )  analytical works have proposed to search for this type of signature of reionization in the sfr function ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "because the mass scale below which reionization suppresses star formation depends on the timing of reionization , locating this signature may constrain the reionization history ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . unfortunately",
    ", the imprint of photoheating in the sfr function may be quite weak and therefore difficult to detect , because of intrinsic scatter that causes galaxies of the same mass to show different sfrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , because of hierarchical assembly that leaves also relatively massive haloes deficient in baryons as they assemble from low - mass photoevaporated progenitors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and because of the averaging in volumes in which reionization may proceed in a patchy manner ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in our simulation l25n512-nosn , which does not include sn feedback and therefore lets us isolate the impact of radiative heating , photoheating indeed causes a pronounced change in the slope of the sfr function at sfrs @xmath145 .",
    "however , in simulation l25n512 that includes both photoheating and sn feedback , the change in the slope of the uv luminosity function due to photoheating is strongly masked by the suppression of star formation by sne at sfrs @xmath146 . in the presence of sne",
    ", the change in the slope of the sfr function occurs at lower sfrs , near the scale at which the lack of low - temperature physics prevents gas cooling and star formation in our simulations .",
    "this result is robust to changes in resolution explored here .",
    "we thus conclude that if sn feedback is as efficient as suggested by our simulations , detecting the signature of reionization heating in the sfr function will be challenging . however , it is important to keep in mind that our simulations ignore that stars may also form in minihaloes cooling through molecular hydrogen transitions , which would be more susceptible to feedback from photoheating .",
    "the steep rise of the sfr function in the presence of radiative heating and sne at low sfrs down to the sfrs that our simulations do not accurately resolve is consistent with that seen in previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and with extrapolations of the observed sfr function ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . because the mass scale below which photoheating affects the sfrs of galaxies is close to the mass scale below which efficient gas cooling requires the presence of molecular hydrogen or metals , quantifying the precise impact of reionization on the uv luminosity function will require more detailed , higher - resolution simulations of galaxy formation that include the relevant gas physics . while this is challenging because it extends the relevant dynamic range to still smaller scales , impressive first steps towards such simulations",
    "have already been made ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .     +      inspecting the properties of individual galaxies",

    "the left - hand panel in each row shows the impact of feedback in the reference simulation at @xmath141 , and the right - hand panel shows the evolution with redshift . in the top right panel , we have divided the sfrs by the virial mass of the haloes hosting the galaxies to improve the clarity of the presentation .",
    "our reference simulation predicts that the faintest galaxies accessible by current observations reside in haloes with masses @xmath148 ( intersection of solid and diagonal dotted curves in the top middle panel ) , consistent with observational estimates based on matching the shapes of the dm halo mass function and the observed uv luminosity function ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the top left panel of figure  [ fig6 ] shows that in our reference simulation , the median sfr at @xmath141 drops sharply below @xmath149 . the comparison with simulation l25n512-nosn in which sne were turned off ,",
    "shows that this scale is set primarily by feedback from reionization . in the absence of photoheating",
    ", star formation continues in haloes with lower masses .",
    "however , even without feedback , galaxies in haloes with masses @xmath150 do not form stars since gas cooling and condensation is prevented by the finite resolution and the lack of low - temperature coolants , such as molecular hydrogen and metals .",
    "sn feedback suppresses star formation strongly across nearly the entire range of galaxy masses .",
    "it only becomes inefficient at the lowest masses at which our finite resolution impacts the conversion of gas into stars , and at the highest masses , at which our simulations are also subject to finite box size effects .",
    "stellar feedback reduces star formation primarily because it reduces the amount of dense gas , both by expelling gas and by limiting the rates at which gas is accreted . in our reference simulation ,",
    "reionization strongly reduces the gas fractions at halo masses @xmath151 .",
    "reionization also reduces , though less strongly , the gas fractions in up to @xmath152 times more massive galaxies , which assemble in mergers of lower - mass baryon - deficient galaxies and accrete gas from the reionized igm ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "sn feedback most strongly impacts the gas fractions at masses @xmath153 in our reference simulation , again demonstrating that reionization and sn feedback act mostly complementary at the reference resolution .",
    "we show in appendix  [ app1 ] that in our high - res simulation , both reionization and sn feedback reduce the baryon fractions more strongly , and sn feedback extends its impact to haloes with masses as low as @xmath154 .",
    "the scale at which photoheating becomes effective in suppressing star formation and reducing the baryon fractions in our reference simulation evolves significantly only after @xmath155 , which coincides with the completion of reionization .",
    "a similar effect is seen in the evolution of the baryon fractions .",
    "this late impact of photoheating suggests a larger role of illumination by the external ionizing background than by localized ionizing sources internal to the galaxies , in agreement with the discussion of the belated impact of radiative heating on the cosmic sfr density above .",
    "however , we caution that in our simulations the impact of local ionizing sources may be underestimated due to the finite resolution . at least before reionization , radiative feedback from local sources is expected to dominate over feedback from external illumination .",
    "this is indeed seen in simulations of the first stars and the start of reionization , which focus on smaller volumes and therefore can afford a higher resolution and also accurately capture the relevant low - temperature physics , primarily the cooling and chemistry of molecular hydrogen ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .      both sne and radiative heating may have a strong impact on reionization .",
    "we have seen above that sn feedback reduces the sfrs and therefore the ionizing luminosities of galaxies , which makes it more difficult for the galaxies to reionize the universe .",
    "however , sne may also open low - density channels in the ism , e.g. by expelling gas in winds , through which ionizing photons may escape more easily ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this makes it easier for galaxies to reionize the universe .",
    "the net impact of sne on reionization is the result of the interplay of these two processes , and is therefore difficult to predict .",
    "we have also seen above that radiative heating may help sne to suppress star formation , which impedes reionization . on the other hand , radiative heating raises the jeans mass in the igm , and this reduces the igm clumping factor and therefore the rate at which the igm recombines . if recombinations consume a significant number of the ionizing photons that escape into the igm , then radiative heating will help keeping the ionized gas ionized and thereby facilitate reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows that sn feedback has only a small impact on the timing of reionization . in the reference and low - res simulations ,",
    "the reionization histories with and without sn feedback are nearly identical , and in the high - res simulation ,",
    "sn feedback delays reionization by @xmath156 . that the net impact of sne on reionization is small suggests that the strong reduction in the sfrs due to sne - in the high - res simulation by a factor @xmath152 by the end of reionization ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) - is partially compensated by an increase , also due to sne , in the escape fraction of ionizing radiation",
    ". a plausible physical mechanism by which this might be achieved , is the strong reduction of the baryon fractions by sne seen in our simulations ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "however , the lack of a substantial impact on the reionization history could also be explained if reionization is driven mostly by the lowest - mass galaxies in which sn feedback is less effective in suppressing star formation due to the limited resolution .",
    "rt computations of the escape of ionizing photons into the igm would help to identify which of these mechanisms is dominant , but this is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig8 ] shows that the reduction in the igm recombination rate due to radiative heating is strong .",
    "we have followed @xcite and have equated the igm clumping factor , @xmath157 , to @xmath158 , which parametrizes the average recombination rate of gas with overdensities @xmath159 .",
    "this enables us to separate recombinations in the igm from recombinations inside galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the latter are typically parametrized by the ionizing escape fraction .",
    "alternative definitions of the clumping factor are sometimes employed , e.g. , by applying additional selection criteria to identify the ionized igm ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , for typical reionization scenarios , these definitions , which are all designed to achieve the same objective , i.e. , locating the ionized gas in the igm , generally yield very similar results ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations likely underestimate the clumping factor before reionization , since the jeans mass in the unheated igm is unresolved ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the positive radiative feedback from photoheating on reionization is also underestimated .",
    "note however , as shown in @xcite , that the clumping factor at @xmath160 is insensitive to the redshift at which reionization occurs for reionization at @xmath161 . as already found in @xcite , sne move gas from galaxies to the igm , and this leads to a slight increase in the clumping factor ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig8 ] shows that the clumping factor derived from the high - res simulation l12n512 is consistent with that in simulation r9l6n256 of @xcite , which had similar resolution but assumed that the igm is heated by a uniform uv background turned on instantaneously at @xmath135 .",
    "this agreement likely results because in our rt simulations , reionization occurs sufficiently rapidly such that differences in the time at which individual regions inside the simulated volume are reionized are small and similar to the time it takes for the igm to respond dynamically to the increase in the jeans mass in the simulation in which the gas is instantaneously exposed to a uniform ionizing background .",
    "the slight increase in the clumping factor by @xmath162 with respect to the earlier work is mostly due to the inclusion of sn feedback , although , as shown in @xcite , the differences in cosmological parameters also contribute . for reionization occurring at redshifts @xmath163 , the igm clumping factor @xmath158 at @xmath160 is numerically converged and insensitive to a further increase in resolution and box size ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss how changes in physical parameters affect the outcome of our simulations and also mention some of the main physical processes our simulations have ignored .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows how variations in the physical parameters impact the reionization history and the ability of galaxies to form stars . towards this end",
    "we have repeated the small - box simulation l12n256 , which has the same resolution as the reference simulation l25n512 but allows for a computationally more efficient exploration of the parameter space , with different values for some of the parameters .",
    "one of the main parameters of reionization simulations is the escape fraction @xmath60 of the unresolved ism .",
    "decreasing this fraction from @xmath164 to @xmath165 and @xmath166 causes reionization to occur at lower redshifts , as expected , at which it extends over longer times , in good agreement with similar parameter studies by @xcite and @xcite . since photoheating is delayed , low - mass haloes can continue to form stars more efficiently down to lower redshifts",
    "however , the associated increase in the ionizing emissivity is smaller than the reduction due to the decrease in the sub - resolution escape fraction , and so the impact on reionization due to the change in the minimum mass of haloes is small ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the current simulations , adopting an escape fraction @xmath167 yields excellent agreement with observations of the evolution of the ionized fraction and the hydrogen photoionization rate at @xmath10 ( but observational constraints are weak ; see the discussion in section  [ sec : reionization ] ) .",
    "the amount of energy injected in each photoionization depends on the spectrum of the radiation sources and requires multi - frequency rt simulations for an accurate computation including spectral hardening ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "here we treat this energy as a parameter ( e.g. , @xcite ) . increasing it implies a slight acceleration in reionization , and a slight decrease in the mean neutral fraction after reionization .",
    "this is caused by the increase in the gas temperatures implied by the higher photoheating rates , which in turn decreases the rate at which hydrogen recombines ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the increased gas temperature increases the negative impact of photoheating on the efficiency of low - mass galaxies to form stars , raising the mass scale below which star formation is strongly suppressed ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we have carried out a preliminary comparison with results from a new set of simulations of reionization similar to those presented here , which feature increased physical realism and span a wider range of box sizes and resolutions .",
    "these simulations will be discussed elsewhere in more detail and include , among others , helium chemistry and cooling / heating , and feedback and metal enrichment from agb stars , core - collapse and type ia sne , and metallicity - dependent population synthesis .",
    "the treatment of helium was made feasible by replacing the explicit chemistry solver described in sec .",
    "[ sec : chemistry ] with the implicit solver described in @xcite , which is faster .",
    "moreover , the simulations are designed , by calibrating the sub - resolution escape fraction and the sn energy fraction , to match the observed uv luminosity functions and to exhibit similar reionization histories independent of resolution",
    ". a simulation employing the same resolution as our reference simulation here and adopting a sub - resolution escape fraction of @xmath168 , yields reionization and sfr histories similar to those in the current simulation l12n256 adopting an escape fraction @xmath169 .",
    "our simulations ignored a number of potentially relevant physical processes .",
    "most importantly , perhaps , our simulations ignored the chemistry of and radiative cooling by molecular hydrogen , effectively assuming a soft uv background that prevents the build - up of hydrogen molecules",
    ". this approximation fails at the earliest stages of reionization , where it artificially prevents the formation of stars inside low - mass minihaloes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this early population of stars may preionize the igm and provide a significant feedback on subsequent star formation and reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations have also ignored the enrichment with metals that accompanies the explosion of stars as sne .",
    "metal - enrichment affects the rates at which gas cools and forms stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , which may be especially important in low - mass minihaloes in which radiative cooling by atomic hydrogen is suppressed .",
    "finally , we have only followed the radiative feedback from the relatively soft ionizing radiation emitted by metal - enriched stars .",
    "other sources of radiation , such as zero - metallicity stars ( pop  iii stars ) or x - ray emitting black holes , may be an important source of ionization and feedback during reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have carried out a suite of cosmological radiation - hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation during reionization .",
    "the reference simulation was run in a box of size @xmath170 and contained @xmath171 dark matter and @xmath171 baryonic particles , thus resolving atomically cooling haloes with at least @xmath172 dark matter particles .",
    "simulations using both larger and smaller boxes and higher and lower resolution allowed us to investigate the numerical convergence of our results .",
    "simulations in which either sne or photoionization heating or both are turned off , enabled us to isolate and investigate the impact of feedback from star formation .",
    "ionizing photons were transported using accurate and spatially adaptive rt , tracking the growth of ionized regions and the build - up of an ionizing background at the native high resolution at which the hydrodynamics was carried out .",
    "current cosmological simulations lack both the resolution and the physics to provide an ab initio description of the structure of the interstellar gas and the rate at which the gas cools .",
    "this necessitates the use of physically motivated but resolution - dependent parameters to control the energy that each sn injects and the fraction of ionizing photons that escape into the igm .",
    "sfrs and reionization histories are sensitive to these parameters and this impedes the use of cosmological simulations in predicting these quantities from first principles . on the other hand , one may exploit this sensitivity and choose parameters for which simulated sfrs and reionization histories are consistent with current observational constraints , and investigate the implications of such observationally supported models of galaxy formation .",
    "here we have focused on the role of feedback from sne and photoheating , two processes that critically shape galaxy formation and reionization .",
    "our reference simulation yields sfr densities and a uv luminosity function in excellent agreement with observational constraints and completes reionization by @xmath155 . increasing the resolution leads to a strong increase in the cosmic sfr at high redshifts as it facilitates the condensation of gas into low - mass galaxies .",
    "it leads to a mild decrease in the cosmic sfr at late times , when star formation is strongly regulated by stellar feedback . as a consequence , near the end of reionization , our high - res simulation yields a slightly smaller normalization of the uv luminosity function and our low - res simulation yields a slightly larger normalization of the uv luminosity function than our reference simulation and observations . because of the initial increase in the cosmic sfr , increasing the resolution also increases the redshift at which the igm is reionized .",
    "increasing the size of the simulation box above @xmath173 has only a minor impact on the sfr and reionization histories .",
    "photoheating reduces the baryon fractions and suppresses star formation primarily in haloes with masses below @xmath174 .",
    "sne , on the other hand , reduce the baryon fractions and suppress star formation primarily in haloes more massive than @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , the currently observable cosmic sfr is more strongly suppressed by sne than by photoheating , and sn feedback alone is sufficient to match observational constraints on the uv luminosity function .",
    "the inefficiency of sne in the lowest mass galaxies is primarily a consequence of the lack of low - temperature gas physics and the limited resolution . nevertheless , the feedback from sne is sufficiently strong to mask the impact of photoheating on the abundance of low - mass atomically cooling star - forming galaxies .",
    "we thus do not find a noticeable signature imprinted by reionization heating on the uv luminosity function , although we note that the resolution of our simulations is insufficient to model star - forming minihaloes that would be more strongly affected by photoheating .    despite the relatively small impact on the cosmic sfr",
    ", photoheating is an important feedback process .",
    "first , photoheating amplifies the ability of sne to suppress star formation .",
    "this amplification is nonlinear and mutual , demonstrating the need to simultaneously account for both feedback processes .",
    "second , photoheating smooths out gas density fluctuations in the igm and thereby strongly reduces the igm recombination rate .",
    "this makes it easier to keep the gas ionized , which facilitates reionization .",
    "in contrast , the net impact of sne on reionization is small .",
    "sne strongly suppress sfrs and slightly increase the igm recombination rate as gas is moved from the galaxies to the igm .",
    "however , this leads only to a small delay in the timing of reionization , possibly because sne create additional low - density channels in the ism through which ionizing photons can escape , which increases the escape fraction of ionizing radiation , or because reionization is driven by the lowest mass galaxies in which sn feedback is inefficient in our simulations .    in summary",
    ", our work demonstrates that both photoheating by the stellar radiation that reionizes the universe and the explosion of massive stars as sne may have had a strong impact on structure formation and reionization in the first billion years .",

    "here we extend the discussion of the galaxy properties in our reference simulation in section  [ sec : galprop ] ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) with a brief investigation of the dependence on resolution .",
    "figure  [ figa1 ] shows that in our high - res simulation , in the absence of sn feedback , reionization suppresses star formation only at masses below @xmath176 .",
    "this is significantly less than at the reference resolution , even though the igm in the two simulations is reionized at similar times .",
    "the decrease in the suppression scale is caused by the increase in the sfrs that , in the absence of feedback , accompanies an increase in resolution , and for which photoheating does not entirely compensate in our simulations .",
    "however , the high - res and reference simulations agree closely on the characteristic scale @xmath177 below which the median sfr is strongly suppressed by the combined action of radiative and sn feedback . in the low - res simulation ,",

    "<S> sn feedback strongly reduces the star formation rates ( sfrs ) over nearly the full mass range of simulated galaxies and is required to yield sfrs in agreement with observations . </S>",
    "<S> photoheating helps to suppress star formation in low - mass galaxies , but its impact on the cosmic sfr is small . because the effect of photoheating is masked by the strong sn feedback , it does not imprint a signature on the uv galaxy luminosity function , although we note that our resolution is insufficient to model star - forming minihaloes cooling through molecular hydrogen transitions . </S>",
    "<S> photoheating does provide a strong positive feedback on reionization because it smooths density fluctuations in the igm , which lowers the igm recombination rate substantially . </S>",
