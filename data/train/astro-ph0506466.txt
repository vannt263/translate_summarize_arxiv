    "separation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) signal from extragalactic and galactic foregrounds ( gf ) is one of the most challenging problems for all the cmb experiments , including the ongoing nasa and the upcoming esa mission .",
    "the gf produces the major ( in amplitude ) signal in the raw maps , which is localized at a rather small latitude band @xmath2 . to avoid any contribution of the gf to the derived cmb map , starting from to experiments , a set of masks and disjoint regions of the map are in use for extraction of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the question is , what kind of assumption about the properties of the foregrounds should we apply for the data processing and what criteria determines the shape and area of the mask and the model of the foregrounds ? to answer these questions we need to know the statistical properties of the gf to determine the strategy of the cmb signal extraction from the observational data sets .",
    "these questions are even more pressing for the cmb polarization .",
    "unlike temperature anisotropies , our knowledge about the polarized foregrounds is still considerably poor .",
    "additionally , we have yet to obtain a reasonable truly _ whole - sky _ cmb anisotropy maps for statistical analysis , while obtaining a whole - sky polarization map seems to be a more ambitious task .",
    "modeling the properties of the foregrounds thus needs to be done for achieving the main goals of the mission : to the cmb anisotropy and polarization signals for the whole sky with unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity .",
    "apart from modeling the foregrounds , @xcite ( hereafter toh ) propose the `` blind '' method for separation of the cmb anisotropy from the foreground signal .",
    "their method ( see also @xcite ) is based on minimizing the variance of the cmb plus foreground signal with multipole - dependent weighting coefficients @xmath3 on k to w bands , using 12 disjoint regions of the sky .",
    "it leads to their foreground cleaned map ( fcm ) , which seems to be clean from most foreground contamination , and the wiener - filtered map ( wfm ) , in which the instrumental noise is reduced by wiener filtration .",
    "it also provides an opportunity to derive the maps for combined foregrounds ( synchrotron , free - free and dust emissions  etc . ) .",
    "both fcm and wfm show certain levels of non - gaussianity @xcite , which can be related to the residuals of the gf @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe that it is imperative to develop and refine the `` blind '' methods for the mission , not only for better foreground separation in the anisotropy maps , but also to pave the way for separating cmb polarization from the foregrounds .    the development of `` blind '' methods for foreground cleaning can be performed in two ways : one is to clarify the multipole and frequency dependency of various foreground components , including possible spinning dust , for high multipole range and at the high frequency instrument ( hfi ) frequency range .",
    "the other requires additional information about morphology of the angular distribution of the foregrounds , including the knowledge about their statistical properties in order to construct realistic high - resolution model of the observable foregrounds . since the morphology of the cmb and foregrounds is closely related to the phases @xcite of @xmath4 coefficients from spherical harmonic expansion @xmath5 , this problem can be re - formulated in terms of analysis of phases of the cmb and foregrounds , including their statistical properties @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", it is reported that a major part of the gf produces a specific correlation in spherical harmonic multipole domain at @xmath6 : between modes @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the series of @xmath9-correlation from the gf requires more investigation .",
    "this paper is thus devoted to further analysis of the statistical properties of the phases of the foregrounds for such correlation .",
    "we concentrate on the question as to what the reason is for the @xmath9 correlation in the data , and can such correlation help us to determine the properties of the foregrounds , in order to separate them from the cmb anisotropies .    in this paper",
    "we develop the idea proposed by @xcite and demonstrate the pronounced symmetry of the gf ( in galactic system of coordinates ) is the main cause of the @xmath9 correlation .",
    "the estimator designed in @xcite to illustrate and tackle such correlation can help us understand gf manifestation in the harmonic domain , leading to the development of `` blind '' method for foreground cleaning . in combination with multi - frequency technique proposed in @xcite ,",
    "the removal of @xmath9 correlation of phases can be easily used as an effective method of determination of the cmb power spectrum without galactic mask and disjoint regions for the data .",
    "it can serve as a complementary method to the internal linear combination method @xcite and to the toh method as well , in order to decrease the contamination of the gf in the derived maps .",
    "such kind of correlation should be observed by the mission and will help us to understand the properties of the gf in details , as it can play a role as an additional test for the foreground models for the mission .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the @xmath10 estimator for @xmath9-correlation in the coefficients @xmath4 and its manifestation in the observed signals . in section 3",
    "we apply the estimator on 3 toy models which mimics galactic foregrounds to investigate the cause of such correlation . in section 4",
    "we discuss the connection between the @xmath9 correlation and the foreground symmetry .",
    "we also examine the power spectrum of the estimator and the correlations of @xmath10 estimator in section 5 .",
    "the conclusion is in section 6 .",
    "as is shown in @xcite to illustrate the @xmath9-correlation , we recap the estimator taken from the combination of the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath4 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and the coefficients @xmath13 are defined by the standard way : @xmath14 @xmath15 is the whole - sky anisotropies at each frequency band , @xmath16 are the polar and azimuthal angles of the polar coordinate system , @xmath17 are the spherical harmonics , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the amplitudes ( moduli ) and phases of @xmath20 harmonics .",
    "the superscript @xmath21 in @xmath10 characterizes the shift of the @xmath22-mode in @xmath23 and , following @xcite , we concentrate on the series of correlation for @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "note that the singal of galaxy mostly lies close to @xmath26-plane .",
    "the estimator @xmath10 in form eq.([eq1 ] ) is closely related with phases of the multipoles of the @xmath15 signal .",
    "taking eq.([eq2 ] ) into account , we get @xmath27 . \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] from eq.([eq3 ] ) one can see that , if the phase difference @xmath28 , then @xmath29    if @xmath30 , the map synthesized from the @xmath23 estimator is simply a map from the @xmath4 with phases rotated by an angle @xmath31 and the amplitudes lessened by a factor @xmath32 , while for non - correlated phases @xmath33 we have specific ( but known ) modulation of the @xmath4 coefficients ( see the appendix ) .",
    "a non - trivial aspect of @xmath23 estimator is that it significantly decrease the brightest part of the galaxy image in the k - w maps . in the following analysis we use a particular case",
    "@xmath34 so that @xmath35 , although it can be demonstrated that for @xmath36 the results of analysis do not change significantly as long as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the multipole number in the spectrum where the instrumental noise starts dominating over the gf signal .",
    "in this section we show how the @xmath39 estimator transforms the gf image in the k - w maps , taking from the nasa lambda archive @xcite . in fig.[fig1",
    "] we plot the maps synthesized from the @xmath10 estimator for k - w band ( for @xmath35 and @xmath40 ) @xmath41 note that the amplitudes are significantly reduced in each map .",
    "it should be emphasized that the @xmath42 map is not temperature anisotropy map , as the phases are altered .",
    "let us discuss some of the properties of the @xmath39 estimator , which determine the morphology of the @xmath42 maps .",
    "first of all , from eq.([eq1 ] ) one can find that for all @xmath43 modes , the estimator is equivalent to zero if @xmath44 and it is non - zero ( and doubled ) if @xmath45 . in terms of phase difference in eq.([eq4 ] ) this means that for @xmath43 modes @xmath39 estimator removes those which have the same phases , while doubles the amplitudes of others whose phases differing by @xmath46 in the @xmath42 maps .",
    "however , such specific case of @xmath23 estimator for @xmath43 modes is not unique for @xmath24 only .",
    "it seems typical for any values of @xmath21 parameter .",
    "what is unique in the data is that for @xmath47 the order of sign for @xmath43 modes leads to the @xmath42 image without strong signal from the galactic plane .",
    "we present in fig.[fig2 ] the images synthesized of the even and odd @xmath48 modes from the w band signal .",
    "the even and odd @xmath48 modes reflect different symmetry of the signal , related to the properties of the spherical harmonics and the corresponding symmetries of the foregrounds . for even @xmath48 the brightest part of the signal is mainly localized in the galactic plane area ( the top panel ) , while for odd @xmath48 modes the signal has less dominated central part from the gf , but it has well presented periodic structure in @xmath49 direction ( horizontal stripes ) , from the north to south pole caps crossing the galactic plane . in fig.[fig3 ] we present the symmetry of the gf for the w band signal for even and odd @xmath22 harmonics , including all corresponding @xmath48 modes .                    as one can see from fig.[fig2]-[fig3 ] , the even @xmath48 and the even @xmath22 maps ( the top of fig.[fig2 ] and fig.[fig3 ] ) have a common symmetrical central part , which looks like a thin belt covered in @xmath50 area and all @xmath51 range . for odd modes",
    "the brightest gf mainly concentrate locally in @xmath49 and @xmath52 rectangular areas .",
    "additionally , for the maps of even and odd @xmath22 harmonics in fig.[fig3 ] we have periodic structure of the signal in @xmath49 direction , which is determined by the properties of the spherical harmonics , and , more importantly , by the properties of @xmath7 coefficients of decomposition , which reflect directly corresponding symmetry of the gf .",
    "in this section we want to examine why the @xmath9 correlation appears . in order to answer this question",
    "we introduce 3 toy models for the galaxy emissivity , which reflect directly different symmetries of the galactic signal . in appendix",
    "we analyze more general situation .",
    "these 3 toy models are the belt , the rectangular and the spots models .",
    "all 3 models are the simple geometrical shapes added with the ilc map .    1 .   the belt model : + we add on top of the ilc map with @xmath53 if @xmath54,and @xmath55 $ ] , where @xmath56 is the halfwidth of the belt .",
    "we set @xmath57 mk and @xmath58 .",
    "2 .   the rectangular model : + we add on top of the ilc map with @xmath59 for @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "we further use two variants * @xmath58 and @xmath62 , * @xmath58 and @xmath63 .",
    "3 .   the spots model : + this model is to mimic the properties of symmetric bright point - like sources convolved with a gaussian beam @xmath64 with fwhm=@xmath65 .",
    "so on ilc map we add + @xmath66 + where @xmath67 is the dirac-@xmath56 function , and",
    "the amplitudes of the point sources @xmath68 are in order of 10 mk .",
    "below we examine these toy models to see how they can illustrate the @xmath9 correlation .",
    "ideologically this model best illustrates that the symmetry of the gf signal can help remove the gf itself without any additional assumption about properties of the foregrounds and of galactic mask as well .",
    "the theoretical basis is that the properties of the phases for the belt signal are related to @xmath43 modes ( see below ) .",
    "thus , any method that can remove all @xmath43 modes from the map is automatically able to remove the belt - like galactic signal and reproduce the ilc signal for all @xmath69 modes without any errors .",
    "however , these @xmath43 modes contribute significantly to the low multipole part of the power spectrum @xmath70 for the reconstructed cmb signal ( which is in our model the ilc signal for @xmath71 modes ) .",
    "using @xmath23 estimator we can avoid the problem of reconstruction of the @xmath43 modes and the corresponding power spectrum of the @xmath42 map ( see section [ power ] ) .    in fig.[sim ]",
    "we plot the resultant @xmath42 maps for the belt - like model .",
    "as one can see , the particular case seems peculiar for the @xmath72 estimator , which does not remove the galactic signal properly . according to the private communication with eriksen et al .",
    ", this simple model of the galactic signal should reflect the properties of spherical harmonics , namely the @xmath9 correlation mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of this model is related to @xmath73 correlation of even harmonics , while for odd harmonics the galactic signal must vanish . however , for some of the @xmath43 harmonics the @xmath74 estimator differs from zero , and the corresponding stripes determines the morphology of the image ( see fig.[sim ] , the second from the top ) . to show that effect clearly , in fig.[sim ]",
    "( the third ) we plot the map , which contains the non - zero @xmath74 modes .",
    "remarkably , the morphology of defects in the second and third one are practically the same . to demonstrate that , in the @xmath42 map ( the second in fig.[sim ] ) we simply remove all non - zero @xmath74 modes and get the map shown in fig.[sim ] as the 4th .",
    "so , the second and the 4th maps are the same , excluding all non - zero modes @xmath74 from the @xmath42 map . this result is not surprising , if one takes into account the symmetry of the belt signal , all the phases of @xmath75 harmonics for @xmath69 are exactly those of @xmath71 harmonics in the ilc map , while all @xmath76 in the first from the top in fig.[sim ] map are mainly determined by the belt signal ( galaxy ) . to show that in fig.[sim ] we simply remove all @xmath76 modes from the ilc plus",
    "the belt map and the resultant is shown in fig.[sim ] the bottom map .",
    "one can see , that this is the ilc map for all @xmath77 harmonics .",
    "what properties of this toy model are crucial in producing the @xmath9 multipole correlation of the phases ? taking the definition of the belt signal into account , one can obtain that for the belt signal    @xmath78 , \\label{bel}\\ ] ]    where @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the kronecker symbol , @xmath81 is the legendre polynomials and @xmath82 . for @xmath83",

    "let us assume that for some @xmath88 the first term is positive and the second term is negative .",
    "in this case    @xmath89 \\sin\\left[(\\l+\\delta+\\frac{1}{2})\\delta\\right ] , \\label{bel3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and unlike compensation of the modes @xmath90 , we have the signal in order of magnitude close to @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , taking into account that the amplitude of that signal decreases very rapidly in comparison with amplitudes of the cmb signal , starting from some multipoles @xmath92 the order of sign in eq.([eq2 ] ) is determined by the cmb signal and the number of horizontal stripes increase rapidly , as it is seen from the fig.[sim ] ( the second map from the top ) .",
    "thus , for a given `` belt '' model of the galaxy emissivity for the range of multipoles @xmath93 the @xmath9 multipole correlation does not exist .",
    "however , in the opposite approximation @xmath94 the properties of the multipole coefficients are determined by the asymptotic of legendre polynomials in eq.([bel ] )    @xmath95^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\label{bbel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and formally @xmath96 for all @xmath97 , @xmath98,but @xmath99 . as follows from eq.([bbel ] ) , the symmetry of the belt model does not require @xmath9 correlation at all . if @xmath21 parameter is even @xmath100 , the sum @xmath101 is even too , and the corresponding @xmath84 coefficient vanishes .",
    "the case for @xmath24 is a special one for the more general correlation @xmath100 , which will be broken at the limit @xmath83 .",
    "however , the belt model as discussed above provides a useful estimation of the properties of the @xmath10 estimator for more general cases , when the symmetry of the gf is not so high as in the belt toy model .",
    "particularly , to prevent any contribution to the @xmath42 map from the highly symmetrical part of the gf , we will use further generalization of the @xmath10 estimator as follows : @xmath102 we will use this generalization for @xmath10 in all the subsequent discussions ( excluding descriptions of the toy models in  3.2 and 3.3 ) .",
    "let us discuss the properties of the model which mimics the galaxy image in the map as a rectangular area , characterized by halfwidth @xmath56 in @xmath49 direction and @xmath103 in @xmath52 direction and with a constant amplitude of the signal @xmath104 in the area @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",

    "we have @xmath121 and for @xmath122 the sign of @xmath119 is the same , as for @xmath123 .",
    "taking into account that for @xmath124 estimator the order of signs for @xmath75 and @xmath125 is crucial , we can conclude that the compensation of the central part of the signal requires @xmath122 .",

    "note that these limits are related with the brightest positive and negative spots ( point sources ) in the maps , while diffuse components have significantly smaller amplitudes . to show the high resolution @xmath42 map which characterizes the properties of the foregrounds in v and w band , in fig.[pow ] we plot the map of difference @xmath189 bands , and the corresponding @xmath42 map for @xmath190 .",
    "note that @xmath191 map does not contain the cmb signal , but for high @xmath22 the properties of the signal are determined by the instrumental noise .",
    "to characterize the power spectrum of the @xmath42 maps we introduce the definition @xmath193 if the derived @xmath23 signal is gaussian , that power represents all the statistical properties of the signal . for non - gaussian signal ,",
    "@xmath194 power characterizes the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix . from fig.[psim ] it can be clearly seen that for foregrounds , especially for v and w bands , the power spectra of @xmath42 are significantly smaller than the power of the cmb , for estimation of which we simply use the power of toh fcm map , transformed by @xmath23 estimator as @xmath195 assuming that fcm map is fairly clean from the foreground signal .",
    "an important point of analysis of the foregrounds is that for v and w bands @xmath23 estimator decreases significantly the amplitude of gf , practically by 1 to 2 order of magnitude below the cmb level .",
    "the most intriguing question related to @xmath9-correlation of the derived map from the v and w band signals is what is reproduced by the @xmath23 estimator ?",
    "the next question , which we would like to discuss is why the power spectrum of @xmath23 estimation of the v and w bands shown in fig.[fig22 ] are practically the same at the range of multipoles @xmath196 , when we can neglect the contribution from instrumental noise to both channels and differences of the antenna beams .",
    "the equivalence of the powers for these two signals , shown in fig.[fig22 ] , clearly tell us that these derived maps are related with pure cmb signal ( which we assume to be frequency independent ) .",
    "in this section we present some analytical calculations which clearly demonstrate what kind of combinations between amplitudes and phases of the cmb signal in the v , w bands and phases of foregrounds are represented in the @xmath23 estimator . as was mentioned in section 1 , this estimator is designed as a linear estimator of the phase difference @xmath197 , if the phase difference is small .",
    "let us introduce the model of the signal at each band @xmath198 , where @xmath155 is frequency independent cmb signal and @xmath199 is the sum over all kinds of foregrounds for each band @xmath200 ( synchrotron , free - free , dust emission etc . ) .",
    "according to the investigation above on the foreground models , it is realized that without the ilc signal the @xmath23 estimation of the foregrounds , especially for v and w bands , corresponds to the signal to simplify the formulas ] @xmath201 the power of which is significantly smaller then that of the cmb @xmath202 in terms of moduli and phases of the foregrounds at each frequency band    @xmath203    where @xmath204 and @xmath159 are the phases of foreground and the cmb , respectively . and from eq.([dd0 ] ) we get @xmath205 and practically speaking , we have @xmath206 .",
    "thus , taking the @xmath9 correlation into account , we can conclude that it reflects directly the high correlation of the phases of the foregrounds , determined by the gf .",
    "moreover , if any foreground cleaned cmb maps derived from different methods display the @xmath9 correlation of phases , it would be evident that foreground residuals still determine the statistical properties of the derived signal .      one of the basic ideas for comparison of phases of two signals is to define the following trigonometric moments for the phases @xmath207 and @xmath157 as : @xmath208 where @xmath209 .",
    "we apply these trigonometric moments to investigate the phase correlations for toh fcm and wfm . for",
    "that we simply substitute @xmath210 in eq.([def2 ] ) , and define @xmath159 as the phase of fcm and @xmath157 as that of wfm .",
    "the result of the calculations is presented in fig.[comp ] .    from fig.[comp ]",
    "it can be clearly seen that the fcm has strong @xmath211 correlations starting from @xmath212 which rapidly increase for @xmath213 , while for wfm these correlations are significantly damped , especially at low multipole range @xmath214 .",
    "however , the @xmath23 estimator allow us to clarify the properties of phase correlations for low multipole range .",
    "the idea is to apply @xmath23 estimator to fcm and wfm , and to compare the power spectra of the signals obtained before and after that .",
    "according to the definition of @xmath23 estimator , the power spectrum of the signal is given by eq.([pp1 ] ) , which now has the form @xmath215 .",
    "\\label{dd}\\ ] ]                the last term in eq.([dd ] ) corresponds to the cross - correlation between @xmath75 and @xmath216 modes , which should vanish for gaussian random signals after averaging over the realization . for a single realization of the random gaussian process",
    "this term is non - zero because of the same reason ,",
    "as well known `` cosmic variance '' , implemented for estimation of the errors of the power spectrum estimation ( see naselsky et al .",
    "thus @xmath217 and error of @xmath194 is in order to @xmath218 to evaluate qualitatively the range of possible non - gaussianity of the fcm and wfm , in fig.[fpow ] we plot the function @xmath219/[d(\\l)+c(\\l)]$ ] for fcm and wfm , in which we mark the limits @xmath220 . as one can see , potentially dangerous range of low multipoles is @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 for the wfm .",
    "non - randomness on some of the multipole modes is mentioned in @xcite .            at the end of this section",
    "we would like to demonstrate that application of @xmath23 estimator to maps with foregrounds residuals , such as the fcm , provides additional `` cleaning '' . in fig.[clean",
    "] we present the @xmath224 and @xmath225 trigonometric moments for the fcm with shift of the multipoles @xmath226 .",
    "one can see that the @xmath227 correlation of phases is strong ( practically , they are at the same level as @xmath228 correlations ) .",
    "however , after @xmath23 filtration these correlations are significantly decreased .",
    "the implementation of the @xmath229 estimator to the non - gaussian signal significantly decreases these correlations .",
    "the properties of the @xmath23 estimator described can manifest themselves more clearly in terms of images of the cmb signal . in fig.[clean1 ] we plot the results of the maps with @xmath23 implemented on fcm and wfm , in order to demonstrate how the estimator works on the non - gaussian tails of the derived cmb maps . in fig.[clean1 ] we can clearly see that the morphology of the @xmath42 maps are the same and difference between @xmath230 and @xmath231 is related to point sources residuals localizes outside the galactic plane ( see the 3rd panel ) .",
    "a direct substraction of the wfm from the fcm reveals significant contamination of the gf residuals and non -galactic point sources ( the third from the bottom and bottom maps ) .",
    "the second from the bottom map corresponds to difference between @xmath230 and @xmath231 for which the amplitudes of the signal represented in colorbar limit @xmath232 mk .",
    "one can see that the gf is removed down to the noise level . in combination of the phase analysis",
    "we can conclude that the implementation of the @xmath23 estimator looks promising as an additional cleaning of the gf residuals and can help investigate the statistical properties of derived cmb signals in more detailed .",
    "in this paper we examine a specific group of correlations between @xmath22 , which is used as an estimation of the statistical properties of the foregrounds in the maps .",
    "these correlations , in particular , among phases are closely related to symmetry of the gf ( in galactic coordinate system ) . an important point of analysis",
    "is that for the foregrounds the correlations of phases for the total foregrounds at v and w bands have specific shape when @xmath233 .",
    "these correlations can be clearly seen in the w band of the data sets down to @xmath40 and must be taken into account for modeling of the foreground properties for the upcoming mission .",
    "we apply the @xmath23 estimator to the toh fcm , which contains strong residuals from the gf and show that these residuals are removed from the @xmath231 map . moreover , in that map the statistics of the phases display the gaussian statistics closer than the original fcm ( no correlation of phases between different @xmath20 modes except between @xmath125 and @xmath75 , which is chosen as a basic one , defined by the form of @xmath23 estimator . )    in this paper we do not describe in details the properties of the signal derived by @xmath23 estimator from the v and w bands .",
    "further developments of the method , including multi - frequency combination of the maps and cmb extraction by the estimator will be in a separate paper . to avoid misunderstanding and confusion , here we stress again that any @xmath42 maps synthesized from the @xmath234 are _ by no means _ the cmb signals ( since the phases of the these signals are not the phases of true cmb ) and the true cmb can be obtained after multi - frequency analysis , which is the subject of our forthcomming paper .",
