    "so for parameters for which bands of different period coexist on the deterministic level , the question arises which of these states is most likely observed in a particle - based langevin simulations including noise . since the hydrodynamic theory can be mapped to the schlgl model  [ eq .  ] , which is a generic model for ostwald ripening  @xcite , we expect bands to merge when they come close to each other .",
    "hence , band interaction is attractive .",
    "indeed , the situation shown in fig .",

    "it is important to stress that the analysis of the existence of homogeneous ordered phases in the thermodynamic limit requires a field theoretic analysis including fluctuations , enabling to understand how information travels in the system  @xcite . whereas the large - scale transport is , for finite reversal rates and @xmath135 , arguably diffusive , implying quasi long - range order  @xcite , transport properties in the thermodynamic limit for vanishing reversal and the related uniqueness of the spr universality class remain open theoretical challenges , as recent experiments suggest the emergence of long - range order  @xcite .",
    "concerning experiments , the finding that reversing self - propelled rods self - segregate into elongated nematic streams suggests a potential mechanism for pattern formation in microbiological systems such as myxobacteria :  since unstable bands may be rendered stable for low reversal frequencies  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots ] ) , the initial stage of aggregation could be triggered at the individual level by downregulating the reversal frequency , in line with experimental studies  @xcite and corresponding simulations  @xcite .",
    "experiments further revealed an increasing mean particle speed during the aggregation  @xcite , in turn restabilizing large - scale structures according to our theory .",
    "therefore , the present study suggests that the regulation of velocity reversal is a key element to understand aggregation of several microbiological species .",
    "the detailed modeling of these systems may require more realistic models , in particular the consideration of hydrodynamic interactions , the exchange of chemical signals , heterogeneous environments or boundary effects , thereby offering a plethora of potential extensions of the present study .",

    "<S> we study self - propelled particles with velocity reversal interacting by uniaxial  ( nematic ) alignment within a coarse - grained hydrodynamic theory . combining analytical and numerical continuation techniques , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the physics of this active system is essentially controlled by the reversal frequency . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that elongated , high - density , ordered patterns , called bands , emerge via subcritical bifurcations from spatially homogeneous states . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis reveals further that the interaction of bands is weakly attractive and , consequently , bands fuse upon collision in analogy with nonequilibrium nucleation processes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we demonstrate that a renormalized positive line tension can be assigned to stable bands below a critical reversal rate , beyond which they are transversally unstable . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the kinetic roughening of bands as well as their nonlinear dynamics close to the threshold of transversal instability . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , the reduction of the multi - particle system onto the dynamics of bands provides a framework to understand the impact of the reversal frequency on the emerging nonequilibrium patterns in self - propelled particle systems . in this regard , our results constitute a proof - of - principle in favor of the hypothesis in microbiology that reversal of gliding rod - shaped bacteria regulates the occurrence of various self - organized pattens observed during life - cycle phases . </S>"
