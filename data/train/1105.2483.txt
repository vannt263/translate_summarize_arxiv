    "relativistic hydrodynamics has been widely used to study various phenomena in many areas , such as heavy - ion collisions , relativistic astrophysics and cosmology . however , the formulation of relativistic hydrodynamics is not trivial because the naive introduction of dissipations violates the relativistic causality , and leads to inconsistent behaviors in the property of stability @xcite .",
    "thus the relativistic navier - stokes theory contains superluminal modes and is inadequate as a candidate of relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "many different approaches have been studied for constructing the consistent relativistic hydrodynamics , including phenomenological approach @xcite , kinetic approach @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "the common feature of these approaches is that the shear stress tensor and the bulk viscous pressure are treated as dynamical variables in addition to usual hydrodynamic variables ( for example , energy density and fluid velocity ) , and the evolution of the shear stress tensor ( the bulk viscous pressure ) follows a dissipative equation characterized by the shear viscosity ( the bulk viscosity ) and the corresponding relaxation time .",
    "different approach predicts different values for the relaxation times , and also gives different non - linear terms which can appear in the evolution equations as well . in the following , we call these theories the causal dissipative relativistic fluid - dynamics ( cdrf ) @xcite .    in hydrodynamics , all transport coefficients , such as the shear viscosity and the bulk viscosity , are inputs and should be determined from a microscopic theory or experiments .",
    "for the navier - stokes theory , the transport coefficients are usually calculated in two different approaches .",
    "one is the kinetic approach based on the boltzmann equation , and the other is the microscopic ( field - theoretical ) approach through the green - kubo - nakano ( gkn ) formula . as known , the applicability of the boltzmann equation is quite limited and the gkn formula are more general in application .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that both approaches give the same results in the classical dilute gas limit @xcite .",
    "differently from the navier - stokes theory , the computing methods for transport coefficients in cdrf are not well established . in this work",
    ", we will apply the projection operator approach to derive the microscopic formulas for the transport coefficients in cdrf @xcite , which can be viewed as generalization of the gkn formulas for the navier - stokes ( newtonian ) fluids .",
    "although different approaches have been proposed @xcite , as far as we know , this is the unique approach for which the consistency is confirmed by comparing to the results obtained from the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is verified that our formula satisfies the exact result obtained from the f - sum rule when applied to the ( generalized ) diffusion process @xcite .",
    "the results at the vanishing chemical potential were already reported in refs.@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend this analysis to the case of finite chemical potential .",
    "the non - triviality of the finite chemical potential calculation is attributed to the arbitrariness of the operator definition of the bulk viscous pressure . at the vanishing chemical potential ,",
    "this arbitrariness was removed by comparing with the result from the boltzmann equation , but there is no corresponding result at finite chemical potential so far . we show that , if the bulk viscous pressure is defined appropriately , the leading - order result of the ratio of the bulk viscosity @xmath1 to the corresponding relaxation time @xmath3 coincides with the same ratio obtained at the vanishing chemical potential .    another purpose of this paper is to show the physical and mathematical meanings of the approximation used in the derivation . in the derivation of the transport coefficients of dissipative equations , we need to introduce non - trivial approximations to violate the time reversal symmetry . as far as we know",
    ", there is still no established method for this . in this paper",
    ", we use the so - called time - convolutionless ( tcl ) approximation .",
    "the meaning of this approximation was already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we argue that the quantum master equation obtained by van hove and the f - sum rule satisfied in exact quantum time evolution processes are reproduced only when the tcl approximation to the memory function is applied . more importantly , in order to keep the consistency between the results of the boltzmann equation and quantum field theory we have to use the tcl approximation , as was shown in ref .",

    "here we briefly summarize the projection operator method for cdrf @xcite .",
    "the difference between the calculations at vanishing and finite chemical potentials comes from the different definitions for the projection operators .",

    "let us introduce a set of operators for gross ( in our case , the hydrodynamic ) variables by @xmath11 .",
    "in order to implement coarse graining of the heisenberg equation of motion , the projection operator is introduced . following previous works , @xcite",
    ", we adopt the mori projection operator , @xmath12 the inner product here is given by kubo s canonical correlation , @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 $ ] with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being a conserved charge .",
    "note that the statistical expectation is taken not with @xmath9 but with @xmath17 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath18 even for the case of finite chemical potential .    by using this projection operator",
    ", we can re - express the heisenberg equation of motion for the hydrodynamic variables as follows , @xmath19where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath22 matrices and @xmath23 is an @xmath24-vector of operators .",
    "their elements are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the first and second terms on the right - hand side represent the collective oscillation and dissipation after coarse graining of time scale , respectively .",
    "the memory function @xmath27 can be expressed in terms of the time correlation of the third term , through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "if the projection operator is chosen appropriately so as to collect all the macroscopic degrees of freedom , the third term will oscillate very fast and can be interpreted as the noise term . in the following calculation ,",
    "the noise term is neglected .",
    "in this section we discuss the approximation which will be used in the following sections to derive our formulas of transport coefficients .",
    "see also the argument in sec .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have to keep in mind that the evolution equations of viscous fluids violate the time reversal symmetry , while the heisenberg equation of motion ( [ hei ] ) is time reversal symmetric .",
    "thus , to derive the fluid dynamics from an underlying microscopic theory , some non - trivial operations are required .",
    "notice that this is different from the case of the derivation of the fluid dynamics from the boltzmann equation , because the boltzmann equation already violates the time reversal symmetry by the assumption of the molecular chaos . in short , there are two steps to derive fluid dynamics from a microscopic theory : 1 ) the reduction of the number of the dynamical variables and 2 ) the violation of time reversal symmetry . in the boltzmann equation approach , the second step is already done as was mentioned above and the first step corresponds to , for example , the chapman - enskog or moment expansion",
    ". then the one - particle distribution function is replaced by hydrodynamic variables such as the energy density and the fluid velocity . in the projection operator method",
    ", the first step corresponds to the appropriate choices of the projection operators ( [ moripro ] ) , and the second step corresponds to the coarse graining for the memory function , which we discuss in this section .      as is commonly believed , the origin of the violation of the time reversal symmetry is attributed to the existence of two different time scales : one is macroscopic and the other is microscopic .",
    "the time reversal symmetry is violated when the degrees of freedom associated with the latter scale are neglected compared to the former . however , it is not easy to implement this coarse graining systematically and there are several proposals @xcite . here , we discuss the procedure introduced by van hove in the derivation of the master equation from the schrdinger equation @xcite . in his derivation , the time variable @xmath28 is rescaled as @xmath29 which is defined by @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the coupling constant for the microscopic interaction .",
    "then van hove collected all terms which survive in the asymptotic limit of @xmath32 with @xmath29 fixed and succeeded in deriving the quantum master equation .",
    "this limit is called the van hove limit .",
    "mathematically speaking , the van hove limit corresponds to the procedure of picking up only secular terms which dominate the dynamics at the macroscopic time scale ( which is realized in small coupling limit in his case ) .",
    "van hove s argument indicates that to obtain macroscopic dissipative equation correctly , we have to collect only appropriate terms such as the secular terms .    in the projection operator method , to violate the time reversal symmetry , we have to introduce a coarse graining of time scale in the memory function @xmath33 . as is discussed @xcite , the memory function is given by the time correlation of the noise term , which is the consequence of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the time scale of the noise is much shorter than that of @xmath34 and hence the time scale of @xmath33 can be negligibly small comparing to that of @xmath34 . does not span the completely set of the gross variables .",
    "then we have to generalize the definition of the projection operator .",
    "the other possibility is that there is no coarse - grained macroscopic theory and we have to solve the microscopic dynamics exactly .",
    "thus the time dependence of the memory function can be the criterion to see whether the definition of the projection operator is appropriate or not .",
    "see also the discussion in ref . @xcite .",

    "( [ morieq ] ) is approximated as @xmath35 this is the tcl approximation .",
    "see also the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if we carry out the taylor expansion of @xmath36 in terms of @xmath29 up to the next - to - leading order , we have @xmath37note that we still assume that the dominant contribution of the integral comes from @xmath38 and the upper limit of the integration is replaced by @xmath39 .    at first glance , it might be considered that the latter approach ( eq . ( [ morieq-2 ] ) ) is more reliable because the next - order correction in the time - derivative expansion is considered . however , this is not trivial from the view point of the appropriate violation of the time reversal symmetry .",
    "here we discuss which approximation is consistent with van hove s argument @xcite by applying the projection operator method to derive the quantum master equation .",
    "the detailed derivation is shown in appendix [ app1 ] . as is shown by eq .",
    "( [ ori - naka ] ) , van hove s result is reproduced only when the tcl approximation is adopted .",
    "that is , the tcl approximation corresponds to the procedure of collecting all the secular terms in deriving the quantum master equation . on the other hand ,",
    "when we consider the next - order correction to the tcl approximation , we pick up even irrelevant contributions .",
    "this is one of the evidences supporting that the tcl approximation may work better than eq .",
    "( [ morieq-2 ] ) in describing macroscopic physics .",
    "next , we show that the tcl approximation gives a consistent result with an exact relation obtained from the microscopic dynamics , while the next - order correction gives rise to an inconsistency @xcite .    to show this , let us consider a non - relativistic diffusion process .",
    "before deriving the ( generalized ) diffusion equation from the microscopic dynamics , we will point out that there is an exact relation for the dynamics of a conserved density following refs .",
    "we consider the complex schrdinger fields , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , whose dynamics conserves the ( spatial integration of the ) number density defined by @xmath42 , as is shown in ref . @xcite . from the noether s theorem",
    ", we can obtain the corresponding current operator @xmath43 .",

    "in fact , the laplace - fourier transform of the diffusion equation is given by @xmath53 differently from the exact result ( [ diffexa ] ) , one observes the following features : 1 ) there is a @xmath54 term which does not disappear in eq .",
    "( [ diffexa ] ) and 2 ) the coefficient for @xmath55 can not reproduce the exact result , although it is not shown here .",
    "thus the diffusion equation can not reproduce the exact behavior obtained from quantum mechanics .    however , if we consider the maxwell - cattaneo - vernotte - type generalized diffusion equation , @xmath56 we can completely reproduce eq.([diffexa ] ) up to @xmath57 as , @xmath58 if the transport coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 satisfy the following relation , @xmath61    if we require our approximation to the projection operator method to be consistent with the f - sum rule , the derived @xmath59 and @xmath60 must satisfy eq .",

    "( [ morieq-2 ] ) , the definition of @xmath68 is modified as is shown in eq . ( 65 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , and one can not reproduce the exact relation for the ratio @xmath69 anymore . this is the second reason of why we do not take into account the next - order correction .    the above argument is developed for specific examples , the quantum master equation and the generalized diffusion equation .",
    "thus , exactly speaking , it is not obvious whether the next - order correction still causes inconsistency in the transport coefficients of cdrf .",
    "there may exist examples where the time - reversal symmetry can be violated by the derivative expansion used to derive eq .",
    "( [ morieq-2 ] ) .",
    "however , in the case of cdrf , there is another evidence to support the tcl approximation .",

    "@xcite , it was shown that those results are consistent ( not the same ) with those from the projection operator when the tcl approximation is employed at vanishing chemical potential .",
    "the fact that the consistent results are obtained from two different approaches is very surprising and strongly suggests to employ the tcl approximation .",
    "the expression of the relaxation time including the next - order correlation is explicitly given by eq .",

    "however , as was discussed in this section , we can not obtain reasonable results if we include this next - order correction to the tcl approximation .",
    "this indicates that the derivative expansion , which is used in ref .",
    "@xcite , may not violate the time reversal symmetry appropriately .",
    "in fact , exactly speaking , hydrodynamics derived in this way corresponds to the relativistic burnett equation and the corresponding transport coefficients are not those of cdrf , although it was assumed that they are equal in some literatures . note that the burnett equation has an intrinsic problem called the bobylev instability and is essentially different from cdrf @xcite .",

    "this means that the tcl approximation can pick up appropriate secular terms which should be kept for deriving dissipative equations . when the tcl approximation is applied to derive a coarse - grained equation of the non - relativistic diffusion process",
    ", the diffusion coefficient and the corresponding relaxation time satisfy the exact relation , the f - sum rule , which is obtained from quantum mechanics . on the other hand",
    ", we can not reproduce these results , if we consider the next - order time - derivative correction to the tcl approximation .    moreover , as is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the shear and bulk viscosities and corresponding relaxation times obtained by using the projection operator method can be consistent with the results from the boltzmann equation only when the tcl approximation is applied . thus we conclude that , to violate the time reversal symmetry appropriately , we should apply the tcl approximation and should not consider the next - order correction .",
    "however it is worth mentioning that , if we take into account this next - order correction to the tcl approximation , we obtain the result given by eq .",

    "next , we derived the formulas of the transport coefficients of the causal dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics at finite temperature and chemical potential by using the tcl approximated projection operator method .",
    "the formulas for the shear and bulk viscosities are given by eqs .",

    "the transport coefficients @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not finite in the free - gas approximation because they are proportional to the imaginary part of the green functions . however , the ratios @xmath123 and @xmath124 are still finite because those are calculated from the real parts of the green functions",
    ". then we obtain @xmath125 where @xmath126 for the charged scalar boson and @xmath127 for fermion .",
    "the functional forms of these ratios are completely the same as the results for the vanishing chemical potential shown in ref .",
    "this equivalence is not observed if we ignore the last term of eq .",
    "( [ def_pi ] ) which is newly added .",
    "it should be noted that these expressions are confirmed only for the leading order calculations and it has not yet known how these relations are modified under the effects of interaction .",
    "this may suggest the consistency of our calculations .",
    "however , to confirm it more precisely , we should compare our results with those from the boltzmann equation including particles and anti - particles . in the case of the vanishing chemical potential ,",
    "the same ratios were calculated from the simple boltzmann equation and confirmed that these are consistent when quantum correlations which are not included in the boltzmann equation are neglected @xcite .",
    "the consistency check for the case of finite chemical potential is left for future task .",
    "besides the viscosities and corresponding relaxation times , cdrf _ can _ contain other transport coefficients .",
    "for example , the heat conductivity and the corresponding relaxation time are other important transport coefficients .",
