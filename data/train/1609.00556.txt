    "in shear flows , hydrodynamic instabilities drive vortical motions that transport momentum between the moving walls , thereby increasing the drag and the forces needed to move the walls .",
    "we here investigate this general connection between hydrodynamical instabilities and the resulting driving force ( or torque ) for the case of the flow between two concentric independently rotating cylinders , the taylor ",
    "couette ( tc ) flow .",
    "tc flow is also a convenient model in which to study the effect of rotation on shear turbulence , since both shear and rotation can be independently controlled by the differential and the mean rotation of the cylinders , respectively .",
    "the mean rotation is known to influence the stability of tc flow @xcite as well as the torque . in tc systems with a ratio of the inner to the outer radius @xmath4 of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the torque as a function of the mean rotation features a maximum that occurs for counter - rotating cylinders @xcite .",
    "the emergence of this torque maximum was rationalised by the occurrence of intermittent turbulent bursts near the outer cylinder @xcite , which result from a stabilisation of the outer fluid layer @xcite .",
    "recent numerical simulations revealed that the bursting behaviour disappears when the cylinder radii become large in the limit @xmath7 , and simultaneously a new rotation dependence of the torque emerges for @xmath8 @xcite : in this low - curvature tc flow , the torque at a shear reynolds number of @xmath9 shows two coexisting maxima , a broad and a narrow one .",
    "moreover , the mean angular momentum profiles were found to have a universal shape as long as the outer region was not stabilized by counter - rotation of the cylinders @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to predict the rotation dependence of the torque for @xmath8 from a simplified model , to explain the origin of the two torque maxima and to rationalise the mean profile shapes and their variation with system rotation .    in the development of our model , we are guided by the following considerations .",
    "the mean rotation of the tc system causes a centrifugal instability that drives vortical flows which redistribute angular momentum radially . as a result ,",
    "the mean profile becomes flat in the centre and has higher angular velocity gradients in the boundary layers ( bls ) close to the cylinder walls .",
    "consequently , the torque , which is proportional to the wall shear stress , rises above its laminar value .",
    "this description clearly illustrates that instability mechanisms , mean velocity profiles and torques are closely connected .",
    "the connection is most explicit in marginal stability theory , initially described for thermal convection @xcite , and later extended to channel flow @xcite and tc flow with stationary outer cylinder @xcite .",
    "we will here present an extension of previous tc studies to the case of independently rotating cylinders , and will focus in particular on the rotation dependence of the torque , with its characteristic non - monotonic behaviour .",
    "moreover , we will benchmark the model against results from numerical simulations of tc flow .",
    "as we will see , marginal stability based on tc flows alone is not sufficient to explain all features of the torque curves , and we will formulate a suitable extension that covers the entire range of rotation numbers .    the paper is organised as follows . in   [ sec :",
    "dns ] we define the control parameters , describe the numerical method and present the simulation results .",
    "these include the rotation dependence of the torque (  [ sec : torque ] ) as well as the shape of angular momentum profiles (  [ sec : profiles ] ) , which we both aim to understand by the subsequent modelling in   [ sec : model ] .",
    "we test to which extent the marginal stability assumptions of the model rationalise the rotation dependence of torque and profiles , by comparing model predictions to simulation results in   [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "discrepancies between model and numerical results point to a change in the bl dynamics that is analysed in   [ sec : bltrans ] .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and further discussions .",
    "we investigate the motion of an incompressible fluid between two concentric cylinders .",
    "the flow is driven by rotating the inner and outer cylinder with angular velocities @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we are here interested in the limit of large cylinder radii @xmath12 and @xmath13 , so that the curvature is small and the radius ratio @xmath4 is close to one . in this low - curvature limit , the cylinder motion is often described by two parameters that can be generalized also to other rotating shear flows @xcite : the average rotation of the system and the shear from the differential rotation of the cylinders .",
    "following @xcite , we describe the motion in a reference frame rotating with the mean angular velocity @xmath14 , so that the cylinders move with the same speed but in opposite directions . in this reference frame , the velocity difference between the cylinder walls becomes @xmath15 and serves as the characteristic velocity scale .",
    "the velocity @xmath16 and system rotation @xmath17 enter the definition of two dimensionless control parameters , the shear reynolds number @xmath18 and the rotation number is opposite to the definition in @xcite . ] @xmath19 here , @xmath20 denotes the gap width between the cylinders and @xmath21 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : res ] ) also gives the relation of @xmath22 and @xmath23 to the traditional reynolds numbers @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the inner and outer cylinder . in the following ,",
    "all results are rendered dimensionless using advective units , where the velocity difference @xmath16 from  ( [ eq : u0 ] ) and the gap width @xmath26 serve as characteristic scales for velocities and lengths , respectively .    to analyse the effect of the system rotation on the turbulence , we performed direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of tc flow at three shear rates @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath9 , and for various values of the rotation number in the range @xmath29 .",
    "however , we focus on @xmath1 , and on radius ratios @xmath30 , represented by the two extreme cases @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for our simulations we used the spectral code described by @xcite , which expands the velocity components by chebyshev polynomials in the radial direction and by fourier modes in the azimuthal and axial direction . consequently , the simulated flow is axially periodic , and we chose an axial length of @xmath33 , which suffices to represent one pair of counter - rotating taylor vortices .",
    "in addition , the azimuthal length of the domain was @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( with periodic boundary conditions ) for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the restriction to only one taylor vortex pair and the reduced azimuthal length have little effect on the torque computation . in the cases of strongly co - rotating cylinders",
    ", we performed the simulations in a reference frame that rotates with @xmath17 .",
    "the spatial resolution , determined by the highest mode order @xmath36 in each direction , is chosen so that the relative amplitude of the highest mode in each direction drops to @xmath37 .",
    "this condition was identified as one criterion for a converged torque computation @xcite and is achieved in the simulations at @xmath1 by the resolutions",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the simulations meet two additional convergence criteria identified by @xcite : agreement of the torques at the inner and outer cylinder to within @xmath40 and fulfilment of the balance between energy input and dissipation to within @xmath41 .",
    "most of the dns data used here are taken from @xcite , with additional computations added in the range @xmath42 .       with the system rotation parametrised by @xmath23 for a constant shear @xmath22 .",
    "in addition to the broad maximum for @xmath43 , a second maximum at @xmath44 emerges with increasing shear .",
    "the torque shows the same @xmath23-dependence for both radius ratios @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "all torques are measured in units of the torque @xmath45 that would result from a laminar flow . ]",
    "the torque needed to drive the cylinders measures the radial transport of angular momentum by the fluid motion @xcite , and is strongly influenced by the turbulence in the system .",
    "in the simulations , we calculate the dimensionless value @xmath46 of the torque @xmath47 at the inner and outer cylinder , where it is proportional to the mean wall shear stress , @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the inner and outer cylinder , respectively , and with the time- and area - averaged angular velocity @xmath51 . here , @xmath52 denotes the fluid density .",
    "figure  [ fig : nu ] shows the torque @xmath53 as a function of @xmath23 at a constant differential rotation @xmath22 . for @xmath43 , the torque shows one broad maximum at a rotation number close to @xmath54 , which in case of @xmath31 and @xmath32 corresponds to co - rotating cylinders .",
    "in contrast , for smaller @xmath55 , the torque maximum appears for counter - rotating cylinders @xcite and was linked to the occurrence of intermittent turbulent bursts caused by the stabilisation of an outer fluid layer @xcite .",
    "moreover , low - curvature tc flows with @xmath56 show a second , narrower torque maximum at @xmath44 that increases with @xmath22 and becomes similar in magnitude to the broad maximum at @xmath1 @xcite . while this narrow torque maximum occurs for counter - rotating cylinders in the tc system with @xmath31 , the rotation number @xmath44 corresponds to co - rotating cylinders for @xmath32 .",
    "consequently , the narrow maximum can not be explained by the intermittent bursts for counter - rotating cylinders @xcite and , thus , relies on a different mechanism than the torque maximum found for @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , the bursting behaviour disappears when @xmath7 and therefore becomes irrelevant for the torque maximisation for @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath23-dependence of the torque is universal for low - curvature tc flows , as demonstrated by the collapse of the torques for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "a similar collapse was also observed in other studies @xcite . in summary , both torque maxima in low - curvature tc flow call for an explanation .       at a constant shear @xmath1 in a low - curvature tc system with @xmath32 .",
    "the time- and area - averaged angular momentum @xmath59 was rescaled to the interval @xmath60 using the transformations @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the specific angular momentum of the inner and outer cylinder.,title=\"fig : \" ]   at a constant shear @xmath1 in a low - curvature tc system with @xmath32 .",

    "to exemplify the characteristics of the profiles for low - curvature tc flows , figure  [ fig : lprof ] shows @xmath65  profiles for @xmath32 .",
    "the angular momentum values are rescaled to the interval @xmath60 to make comparisons between simulations at different @xmath23 easier . for most rotation numbers ,",
    "the angular momentum profiles are almost flat in the middle and reach a central value of @xmath66 .",
    "our recent study @xcite revealed this profile behaviour also for other radius ratios , as long as the flow is not stabilised due to a counter - rotating outer cylinder .",
    "flat angular momentum profiles in the centre were also observed in tc experiments with the outer cylinder held stationary @xcite .    in the limit @xmath7 ,",
    "tc flow becomes linearly unstable only in the range @xmath67 for sufficiently high @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65  profile for the lower stability boundary @xmath68 ( corresponding to perfect counter - rotation with @xmath69 ) features a central region of negative slope , see figure  [ fig : lprof](a ) .",
    "moreover , the gradient of the profile increases as @xmath23 tends to @xmath70 , cf .  figure  [ fig : lprof](b ) .",
    "however , this increase is only a consequence of the rescaling of the profiles by the difference @xmath71 : in the limit @xmath72 , this quantity vanishes since the marginal stability boundary @xmath73 is determined by rayleigh s criterion and the equality of angular momentum at the inner and outer cylinder @xcite .    .",
    "( a )  the gradients for @xmath32 only slightly vary with @xmath22 .",
    "( b )  at @xmath1 , the gradients for two different radius ratios coincide . for most values of @xmath23 ,",
    "the angular momentum profiles are almost flat in the middle region with a slight positive slope .",

    "( b )  at @xmath1 , the gradients for two different radius ratios coincide . for most values of @xmath23 ,",

    "we calculated the gradient by averaging the profile derivative divided by the radius ( @xmath74 ) over the central region @xmath75$].,title=\"fig : \" ]    indeed , figure  [ fig : lgrad ] shows that the profile gradients in the centre measured in advective units do not increase for large @xmath23 and are close to zero for @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , the gradients only slightly vary with @xmath22 ( figure  [ fig : lgrad]a ) and do not differ between simulations for @xmath31 and @xmath77 ( figure  [ fig : lgrad]b ) , which highlights the universal behaviour of the @xmath65  profiles in the centre .",
    "it is important to note that a radially constant angular momentum complies with marginal stability according to rayleigh s inviscid criterion and that at high @xmath22 , viscosity plays an important role only close to the walls and not in the central region .",
    "thus , one can interpret the constant central angular momentum profiles to be in a marginally stable state @xcite .",
    "however , marginal stability is not exactly fulfilled , and the @xmath65  profiles show a slightly positive slope in the middle as previously observed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the general occurrence of an almost flat central region in the angular momentum profile for @xmath76 will be an important ingredient for the model .",
    "the rotation - number dependence of the torque and of the mean profiles is a consequence of the complicated turbulent flow that is governed by the hydrodynamic equations of motion .",
    "the shape of the mean profiles , however , can be rationalized by a few simple modelling assumptions , as first proposed by @xcite and @xcite for the case of thermal convection and later applied to tc flow with stationary outer cylinder by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the following three assumptions :     and @xmath78 having a thickness of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , and the central region @xmath81 . the model profile ( solid lines ) calculated for @xmath32 , @xmath1 and @xmath82",
    "is compared to the corresponding dns profile ( dashed line ) . ]    1 .",
    "the angular momentum profile can be approximated by a sequence of three linear functions as sketched in  figure  [ fig : model ] : the inner bl profile @xmath83 extends from @xmath12 to the radius @xmath84 , the outer bl profile @xmath78 from the radius @xmath85 to @xmath13 and the central profile @xmath81 covers the region in between . here ,",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 denote the inner and outer bl thickness .",
    "the piecewise linear profile approximates the profiles observed in dns ( figure  [ fig : lprof ] ) , but does not capture the smooth transitions between the bls and the central region .",
    "the numerical simulations show that the angular momentum profile is almost flat in the centre except for a small positive slope , so that it is nearly marginally stable by rayleigh s criterion for inviscid flows @xcite .",
    "we allow for this slope by approximating the profile in the centre with the @xmath22- and @xmath23-independent constant @xmath86 .",
    "the proportionality to the mean radius @xmath87 accounts for the observation that the profile gradient divided by the radius ( @xmath88 ) is almost independent of @xmath55 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath89 , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : lgrad ] .",
    "thus , in advective units , the central profile reads @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the angular momentum at the mean radius @xmath92 .",
    "note that while we fixed the slope @xmath93 , the variable @xmath91 is as yet unknown and depends on the external parameters @xmath94 .",
    "3 .   in analogy to the central region , which is close to being marginally stable by rayleigh s criterion , we require that the bls are marginally stable , when viewed as tc subsystems that extend only from the walls to the end of the bls @xcite .",
    "these subsystems have one rigid wall ( the physical cylinders ) and a softer boundary towards the center that effectively leaves more space for the instability modes than a rigid wall .",
    "a similar configuration occurs in tc flow with counter - rotating cylinders where the formed vortices are wider than the unstable inner region @xcite , pointing to an increased effective length scale for the instability modes @xcite .",
    "therefore , we define the effective gap width of the virtual tc systems as @xmath95 and @xmath96 with the constant factor @xmath97",
    ". a comparison between model and dns in   [ sec : comparison ] will reveal that @xmath98 represents a reasonable choice in case of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the embedded tc subsystem of the inner bl can be characterised by an effective radius ratio @xmath99 , a first reynolds number @xmath100 for the physical cylinder and a second reynolds number @xmath101 for the bl edge : @xmath102 with @xmath95 . here",
    ", the angular momenta @xmath103 and @xmath104 are given in physical units and therefore labelled with a hat .",
    "since the new unit of length in  ( [ eq : tci ] ) is the effective gap width @xmath105 , the dimensionless radii become @xmath106 and @xmath107 for the bl tc system .",
    "similarly , the embedded tc subsystem of the outer bl is characterised by an effective radius ratio @xmath108 , a first reynolds number @xmath109 for the bl edge and a second reynolds number @xmath110 for the physical cylinder : @xmath111 with @xmath96 . here",
    ", the effective gap width @xmath112 is the new unit of length , and the dimensionless radii become @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the constants @xmath93 and @xmath115 are fixed by empirical observations , so that the model has three variables : the angular momentum in the centre @xmath91 and the bl thicknesses @xmath79 and @xmath80 . they can be fixed and related to the external parameters @xmath116 by the following considerations : first , we implement the assumption of marginal stability from  ( iii ) by requiring that both bls described by the parameters  ( [ eq : tci ] ) and  ( [ eq : tco ] ) fulfil the stability criterion for laminar tc flow , as described by @xcite .",
    "we resort to their study since they provide analytic expressions for the stability boundary in the full parameter space which are in good agreement with experimental results .",
    "these two conditions for the bls can be solved for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , with an implicit dependence on @xmath91 , which enters the reynolds numbers @xmath101 and @xmath109 via the central profile @xmath81 from  ( [ eq : lc ] ) evaluated at @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "the third condition needed to fix the parameters follows from the requirement that in the statistically stationary state and averaged over long times , the torque exerted on the inner cylinder equals that exerted on the outer cylinder . since the torque is proportional to the mean wall shear stress , cf .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : g_def ] ) , which is calculated from the linearly approximated bl profiles @xmath83 and @xmath78 , the dimensionless torques at the inner and outer cylinder read    g_i&= & _ s(-r_i ._r^i",

    "_ s(-r_o ._r^o",
    "_ |_r_o + 2_o ) = _ s ( r_o + 2_o ) . [ eq : gmodel ]    thus , the third condition becomes @xmath119 . since all three conditions are coupled , and the stability equations given by @xcite are implicit , we solve the equations numerically . for given parameter values",
    "@xmath116 , this procedure results in predictions for @xmath91 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and thus for the torque via equation  ( [ eq : gmodel ] ) . in this context",
    ", it is important to note that the bl thicknesses  @xmath79 and  @xmath80 are used to approximate the profile derivatives in  ( [ eq : gmodel ] ) , whereas the increased gap widths  @xmath105 and  @xmath112 are relevant for the reynolds numbers in  ( [ eq : tci ] ) and  ( [ eq : tco ] ) that describe the stability of the bls .",
    "the predictions from the model can be compared with the quantities calculated from our numerical simulations .",
    "while the definitions of the central angular momentum @xmath120 and of the torque @xmath53 also apply to the dns , a bl - thickness definition inspired by the model is needed for general @xmath65  profiles from simulations or experiments .",
    "therefore , we also approximate the angular momentum profiles from the dns by piecewise linear functions similar to the model profile in  figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "we define the distance of the two intersection points to the corresponding wall as bl thicknesses @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "these lines are obtained by a linear fit to the middle region of the dns profile and by using the derivatives @xmath121 and @xmath122 as the slope for the segments in the inner and outer bl , respectively .",
    "we study the marginal stability model for a constant shear @xmath1 and for the two radius ratios @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "the first @xmath55-value was chosen to analyse the limit where the cylinder curvature plays a negligible role . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the dimensionless cylinder radii become @xmath123 and @xmath124 , and the inner and outer bl behave similarly . therefore",
    ", we only show results for the inner bl here . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath31 corresponds to the smallest radius ratio for which we still observe the two torque maxima that are characteristic of the low - curvature tc flow @xcite .",
    "since the cylinder radii are approximately ten times smaller compared to the @xmath32 case , we expect the curvature to become relevant .",

    "this is apparently different from the case of the magnetorotational instability in tc flows , where the maximum could be related to parameters corresponding to maximal growth rates @xcite .",
    "the model does not reproduce the narrow torque maximum at @xmath44 from the dns , but it predicts a strong decrease in @xmath53 as @xmath23 tends to zero .",
    "consequently , the formation of the second torque maximum must result from another mechanism that will be discussed in the following section .",
    "finally , we note that the only model parameter whose value was not determined by the model assumptions is the constant @xmath97 which describes the effectively larger gap widths @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the reynolds numbers of the bls .",
    "the introduction of @xmath115 is physically justified by the free - surface boundary condition at the bl edge , and its value determines the general magnitude of model torques in  figure  [ fig : comp - nu ] .",
    "however , the variation of the torque with @xmath23 does not depend critically on the value of @xmath115 .",
    "we chose the constant @xmath98 so that the amplitude of the model - torque maximum matches the dns torques .",
    "in contrast , the magnitude of the profile slope in the centre was set to @xmath86 beforehand in accordance with empirical observations .",
    "alternatively , one could have postulated that the central profile exactly realises marginal stability according to rayleigh s criterion , which requires a constant angular momentum and thus the slope @xmath128 . in a previous marginal stability model ,",
    "the angular momentum was assumed to be constant in the central region @xcite , and the effect of setting @xmath128 in our model is exemplified for @xmath32 by the dashed line in  figures  [ fig : comp - prof](a ) and  [ fig : comp - nu](a ) : the bl - thickness predictions with @xmath128 and @xmath86 only differ for large @xmath23 values , with the @xmath86 case being closer to the dns result . similarly , the model prediction for the torque only slightly varies with the value of @xmath93 , and the variation would not be recognisable for the central angular momentum @xmath91 in  figure  [ fig : comp - prof](c ) .",
    "the discussion shows that the value of @xmath115 and the choices for the profile gradient in the central region have only minor effects on the torque , thereby demonstrating the robustness of the model .",

    "the shear gradient across the bl increases with decreasing rotation number , reaches a maximum at a small positive @xmath23 value and then drops again .",
    "in contrast , the model predicts a drastic increase of the bl reynolds number ( only @xmath139 for @xmath31 ) when @xmath23 tends to @xmath148 .",
    "this increase is unrealistic since bls are known to undergo a transition to turbulence if their reynolds number exceeds a critical value @xmath143 @xcite , as previously discussed for tc flow by @xcite .",
    "for example , a prandtl  blasius bl becomes linearly unstable for @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of free - stream turbulence above the bl ( as is the case here in tc flow ) lowers the transition reynolds number @xmath143 @xcite since such strong disturbances can cause bypass transitions in the bl .",
    "consequently , the marginal stability of the bls as determined from the tc stability criterion @xcite is bypassed by a transition to turbulence following another route @xcite .",
    "this bl transition can be incorporated into the model by means of the additional assumption that the bls are also marginally stable with respect to a transition reynolds number @xmath143 , which means that @xmath140 and @xmath139 must equal @xmath143 if they would exceed this value otherwise .",
    "the critical values @xmath150 for @xmath32 as well as @xmath151 and @xmath152 for @xmath31 approximate the maximal magnitude of the shear gradient occurring in the dns , as indicated by the horizontal lines in  figure  [ fig : rebl ] .",
    "these @xmath143 values suggest that , as a result of the increased cylinder curvature for @xmath31 , the outer bl becomes turbulent at a higher shear rate than the inner one .",
    "furthermore , we note for the @xmath31 case that in the improved model , @xmath140 also reaches the transition at @xmath144 as demonstrated by the dotted line in  figure  [ fig : rebl](b ) .    with the additional assumption of marginal stability with respect to the bl transition , the model now also reproduces the onset of the narrow torque maximum , as shown by the green ( grey ) line for @xmath136 and for @xmath130 in  figure  [ fig : comp - nu](a ) and  ( b ) , respectively .",

    "the turbulent fraction drops again for negative rotation numbers , consistent with the fact that in these flow cases the outer cylinder strongly counter - rotates and thereby re - stabilises the flow .",
    "interestingly , the critical rotation number for the transition to turbulence depends on the wall curvature , whereas the general variation of @xmath160 with @xmath23 does not differ between both @xmath55 values : for @xmath31 , the inner and outer bl become turbulent at a larger and smaller @xmath23 value , respectively , than the bls for @xmath32 .",
    "this difference represents another curvature effect and is consistent with the smaller inner ( larger outer ) transition reynolds number @xmath144 ( @xmath178 ) , introduced to describe the dns results for @xmath31 in  figure  [ fig : rebl](b ) .    as a second indicator for the bl transition , we analyse the local power - law scaling of the torque with @xmath22 , i.e. the exponent @xmath170 from @xmath171 , which was previously found to differ between flows with laminar and turbulent bls @xcite .",
    "based on the key assumption of laminar bls that are marginally stable to the formation of taylor vortices , a previous marginal stability calculation predicts the scaling exponent @xmath173 in the limit of large @xmath22 @xcite .",

    "we first note that there is hardly any difference between the cases of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "figure  [ fig : ft+scal]a ) , the exponent significantly falls below the marginal stability prediction , as observed by @xcite in their _",
    "transitional regime_. finally , for @xmath136 the scaling exponent sharply rises demonstrating increasingly turbulent bls . for @xmath175 ,",
    "the exponent exceeds the marginal stability prediction @xmath173 and accordingly indicates the torque scaling of a flow with completely turbulent bls .",
    "both the turbulent fraction @xmath160 and the scaling exponent @xmath170 support the assumption that the bls become turbulent for @xmath136 .",
    "this transition takes place in a small rotation - number range ( @xmath182 ) , and it rationalizes the emergence of the narrow torque maximum at @xmath44 with increasing @xmath22 .",
    "the modelling of mean profiles from a turbulent flow using marginal stability arguments was previously successfully applied to thermal convection @xcite and to tc flow with stationary outer cylinder @xcite .",
    "while we here adopt the modelling arguments of @xcite and @xcite , some modifications were needed to generalise the marginal stability model to the case of independently rotating cylinders : as a first difference , the present model does not assume a constant angular momentum in the central region , and instead incorporates the small positive angular momentum gradient that was observed in simulations and experiments .",
    "while this brings the predictions closer to the dns results for large @xmath23 , the effect of the slope is not very big overall .",
    "the second modification consists in the introduction of the increased effective gap widths @xmath95 and @xmath96 , with @xmath98 , for the tc reynolds numbers of the bls .",
    "the constant @xmath115 accounts for the enlarged space due to a free - surface - like boundary condition at the bl edge .",
    "its value was kept fixed for all @xmath55 and @xmath23 . the previous model without the factor @xmath115 underestimated the measured torques , as the comparison by @xcite showed . finally , as the marginal stability condition for both bls , we here utilise an analytic formula that determines the tc stability boundary in the entire parameter space @xcite . in particular , this stability formula also applies to the wide - gap case and to the situation of counter - rotating cylinders , in contrast to approximate stability conditions used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath183 and co - rotating cylinders , these approximations coincide with the stability boundary by @xcite and therefore give the same results in this parameter range .",
    "the simplifications of the model helped us to interpret the rotation dependence of the torque at @xmath1 : while the broad maximum can be explained by marginal stability of both the central region and the bls , the narrow torque maximum is related to turbulent bls that enhance the angular momentum transport .",
    "our simulations revealed that the assumption of laminar bls is best justified for @xmath176 and that a _ transitional regime _ , where laminar and turbulent regions in the bl coexist , occurs for .",
    "the improved model that incorporates a shear transition suggests that the bls become completely turbulent for @xmath23 below @xmath169 .",
    "remarkably , this demonstrates that the transition to turbulent bls does not only depend on the shear strength ( @xmath22 ) as previously observed @xcite , but also on the system rotation , as also evidenced by the @xmath23-dependence of the bl reynolds numbers @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "moreover , the results for @xmath31 reveal that the transition to turbulent bls depends on the wall curvature as well : at the convex inner cylinder , the transition occurs earlier ( i.e. at a smaller critical value @xmath143 and a larger  @xmath23 ) than at the concave outer cylinder .",
    "we expect this curvature effect to become more pronounced for smaller radius ratios .",
    "previously , @xcite observed that the torque scaling exponent @xmath173 , predicted by marginal stability in the limit of large @xmath22 @xcite , is incompatible with their torque measurements which show a continuous variation of @xmath170 with @xmath22 even in the regime of laminar bls .",
    "our calculations revealed that the exponent  @xmath170 predicted by marginal stability also varies with @xmath23 and @xmath22 ( not shown here ) even at @xmath22 as high as @xmath186 .",
    "as a consequence of this transitional behaviour , the predicted  @xmath170 lies significantly below the asymptotic limit @xmath173 , in agreement with the torque computations in the regime of laminar bls for @xmath187 .",
    "the observed torque scaling exponent falls below the marginal stability prediction in the regime where laminar and turbulent regions in the bl coexist .",
    "it remains unclear how a mixture of laminar and turbulent bl regions can create a slower than laminar effective torque scaling .",
    "however , the observed @xmath170 clearly exceeds the marginal stability limit @xmath188 in the regime where the bls are completely covered with turbulence .",
    "we here investigated the torque and bl behaviour in low - curvature tc flow for @xmath56 .",
    "we expect that the application of the marginal stability model to tc flow with @xmath57 underlies some limitations .",
    "already the larger discrepancies between model and dns for @xmath31 suggest that curvature effects become relevant for @xmath57 .",
    "more importantly , the marginal stability model does not account for the intermittent bursting behaviour observed in the outer flow region for strongly counter - rotating cylinders @xcite : since the flow switches over time between quiescent and highly turbulent phases , the assumption of one marginally stable state is inadequate here .",
    "the intermittent behaviour gains in importance with decreasing  @xmath55 , because the bursting becomes stronger @xcite and occurs in a wider rotation - number range since the regime of counter - rotating cylinders corresponds to @xmath189 .",
    "finally , the model predicts that the bl reynolds numbers increase with @xmath22 , and therefore the @xmath190 curves in  figure  [ fig : rebl ] shift upwards for @xmath191 .",
    "then , the predicted bl reynolds numbers exceed the transition threshold @xmath143 already at a larger critical @xmath23 value , and thus the bls become turbulent in a wider rotation - number range .",
    "therefore , we expect that the broad torque maximum caused by marginal stability will disappear at higher @xmath22",
    ". moreover , in the simulations , the narrow torque maximum at  @xmath44 grows faster with @xmath22 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : ft+scal]b ) , which also suggests that it will eventually outperform the broad maximum .",
