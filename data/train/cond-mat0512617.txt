    "systems with weakly interacting frustrated magnetic clusters form an interesting class of materials with properties lying between those of quantum spin systems and classical magnets.@xcite in this context the @xmath0 ( x = cl , br)@xcite compounds have recently attracted strong interest , as they contain cu@xmath5 tetrahedral clusters .",
    "the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the spins within a tetrahedron are geometrically frustrated and the coupling between the tetrahedra was assumed to be weak . whilst the excitation spectrum of isolated tetrahedra is well known to be gapped , the presence of even small anisotropy or inter - tetrahedral coupling may lead to interesting new ground states and excitations . in these compounds the magnetic susceptibility reaches a maxima at @xmath10 25 k before dropping sharply at low temperatures , which was attributed to the presence of a singlet - triplet spin - gap.@xcite further evidence of spin - gapped behavior in the bromide",

    "the canting angles were determined as 38(6)@xmath19  for the first and 111(10)@xmath19  for the second pair .",

    "the decay was followed by measuring the polarization scattered by the 002 nuclear reflection at regular intervals and an appropriate correction was applied to the scattered polarizations .",
    "+ measurements of each reflection were made with the incident neutrons polarized successively in three directions : parallel to the vertical @xmath53 direction ( @xmath54 ) , along the @xmath55 horizontal component of the scattering vector @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) and in the @xmath58 direction that completes the right - handed cartesian set . in this polarization coordinate system the magnetic interaction vector ( @xmath59 ) , which is the projection of the fourier transform of the magnetization @xmath60 onto the plane perpendicular to @xmath56 , lies mainly in the @xmath61-plane . for each incident polarization direction the components of scattered polarization parallel to the @xmath62 and @xmath53 directions were determined . the six magnetic reflections labelled @xmath63-@xmath64 in table  [ tab1 ] were studied .",

    "+ before attempting a detailed analysis , the different types of magnetic domains which can be present in @xmath0 should be considered .",
    "it is worth remembering@xcite that configuration , orientation and chiral magnetic domains are all possible .",
    "the configuration domains give rise to separate sets of magnetic peaks and are not important for the polarization data analysis .",
    "orientation domains can occur if the @xmath77-axis is not in the magnetic symmetry group .",
    "chirality domains are present because the propagation vector @xmath78 is not one half of a reciprocal lattice vector ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "they are not the same as racemic twins which are allowed because the inversion center is missing in the crystallographic space group .",
    "the last two types of domain contribute to the same magnetic peaks and their presence could significantly complicate the d3 data analysis since orientation domains can depolarize the scattered beam and chirality domains can conceal the special features of helical structures .",
    "+ it was found that within the statistical accuracy the scattered beam was fully polarized for all measured reflections which suggests that only one orientation domain is present .",
    "the two chiral domains are also unequally populated , since the @xmath63 and @xmath80 reflections were almost absent for incident polarization @xmath81 , but had significant intensity for @xmath82 .",
    "+ furthermore , based on the polarization data we can immediately deduce the type of magnetic structure .",
    "the very presence of the @xmath55-components in the scattered polarization ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) indicates rotation of polarization towards @xmath56 , which is not compatible with any amplitude modulated or collinear structure .",
    "such structures would have @xmath85 and the neutron polarization would only precess by 180@xmath19  about @xmath86 .",
    "therefore the magnetic structure must be helical .",
    "+ the most significant qualitative conclusions from the polarimetric measurements are as follows :    * the scattered polarization for the reflection @xmath80 with @xmath87 , shows that the structure is not composed of helices with spins rotating in a plane normal to the wave vector @xmath7 , for in such a case all polarization would be rotated towards the @xmath55 direction .",
    "the presence of @xmath58 and @xmath53 components of scattered polarization indicates that one or more of the planes in which the spins rotate ( plane of helices ) must be inclined to the wave vector .",
    "* for all the reflections studied the @xmath88 components are positive , while @xmath89 are negative .",
    "i ) this clearly indicates that all @xmath86 vectors have a @xmath53-component , so there must be a component of the magnetic moment along @xmath90 .",
    "ii ) it also means that the @xmath53-components of @xmath86 are larger than the @xmath58-components ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "this might indicate that the planes of the helices are close to or contain the @xmath90-axis . *",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath89 and @xmath88 components tend to be larger for reflections with @xmath92 than for those with @xmath93 which strongly suggests the existence of a @xmath94-component of the magnetic moment .",

    "such a lattice has full tetragonal symmetry and the @xmath7 and @xmath25 wave vectors are symmetrically equivalent .",
    "this could mean that the length of the wave vector is determined by the inter - tetrahedral exchange and until there is intra - tetrahedral ordering , the two wave vectors are degenerate .",
    "we suggest that the final arrangement adopted by the tetrahedra may be determined either by chance nucleation and growth of one rather than the other wave vector or by small alterations in the relative strengths of intra - tetrahedral interactions caused by crystal inhomogeneities .",
    "+ the @xmath7 structure is the one which occurs most frequently in the @xmath0 crystals studied up to now by neutron diffraction .",
    "its main feature is that the helices of all spins rotate almost in a single plane , which is close to ( 010 ) .",
    "the 4 spins of each cu@xmath4 tetrahedron form a canted coplanar motif which rotates on a single helix with propagation vector @xmath7 .",
    "the refined moment is 0.88(1)@xmath151/cu ( x = cl ) and 0.395(5)@xmath151/cu ( x = br ) . + the angles between the spins on the sites 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 are very different from one another : the cu1-cu2 spins are almost collinear with @xmath133=13(3)@xmath19(x = cl ) and @xmath133=22(4)@xmath19 ( x = br ) , while the cu3-cu4 arrangement is almost orthogonal @xmath134=70(4)@xmath19   ( x = cl ) and @xmath134=120(5)@xmath19  ( x = br ) . noting that the overlap between magnetic orbitals associated with the @xmath12 path is almost zero@xcite this might indicate that the intra - tetrahedral @xmath12 coupling is rather weak . on the other hand",
    "the angles between spins of different pairs in the same tetrahedron differ only slightly ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) and are close to 145@xmath19  ( x = cl ) and 120@xmath19  ( x",
    "these angles are the same for all tetrahedra in the structure and such regularity might imply that the @xmath11 coupling mediated through the cu - o - cu superexchange path ( @xmath152cu - o - cu@xmath52  110@xmath19 ) is strong .",
    "+ analysis of the angles between spins in adjacent tetradedra reveals that neigbouring ions across the @xmath153 $ ] diagonals are almost antiparallel ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] bottom ) .",
    "this implies that the inter - tetrahedral diagonal @xmath154 coupling could be important with the linear superexchange path cu - x .. x - cu providing a strong af interaction.@xcite the angles between neighbouring ions ions related by the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] lattice translations are very different , in spite of the underlying tetragonal symmetry .",
    "one , for [ 100 ] , is acute ( @xmath155@xmath19 ) and the other obtuse ( @xmath52140@xmath19  x = cl , @xmath52110@xmath19",
    "x = br ) implying weak @xmath156 and @xmath157 coupling in accord with band - structure calculations.@xcite +      one further property of the proposed @xmath7 spin arrangement should be discussed .",
    "this model leads to a finite resultant moment on each tetrahedron which is constant throughout the whole crystal .",
    "this moment rotates in the @xmath158 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) on a cycloid with the propagation vector ( @xmath159 , 0 , @xmath160 ) giving an angle of 54@xmath19  ( x = cl ) and 62@xmath19  ( x",
    "= br ) between the neighbouring tetrahedra along @xmath90 .",
    "interestingly , the resultant moments on the tetrahedra in the chloride ( 0.333 @xmath151 ) and bromide ( 0.388 @xmath151 ) are almost equal , although the moment of the cu@xmath4 ions is close to the saturated value of 1 @xmath151/cu for @xmath15 , whereas it is significantly less for @xmath29 .",
    "+ as the s=1/2 cu@xmath4 ion has very little single ion anisotropy , it is not clear what is responsible for the choice of the @xmath158 plane as the easy plane of the spins",
    ". it might be either the anisotropy of the inter - tetrahedral interactions or the dm interactions the direction of which is determined by the symmetry of the local environment.@xcite the dm interaction could be nonzero in the @xmath0 system and would give a dm vector in the @xmath116 plane@xcite perpendicular to each cu - cu bond within the tetrahedra .",
    "this antisymmetric coupling would favor two spins to ca nt in opposite directions in the plane perpendicular to the dm vector and the fairly constant angle between nearest neighbour spins could reflect the ratio dm/@xmath13 . +",
    "a thorough theoretical study is needed to clarify a number of questions raised by our findings .    *",
    "what relative strengths of the @xmath13 , @xmath161 intra - tetrahedral and @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164@xcite inter - tetrahedral couplings are needed to give the experimentally observed @xmath7 and @xmath25 structures .",
    "* can anisotropy of the inter - tetrahedral interactions alone explain the easy plane of the magnetic moments in the @xmath7 structure .",
    "* does the choice of wave vector ( @xmath7 or @xmath25 ) determine the final spin arrangement adopted by the tetrahedra or do changes in strength of the @xmath13 , @xmath161 couplings moderate the choice between the @xmath7 ( ` canted coplanar ' ) and the @xmath25 ( ` canted pair ' ) structures .",
