    "the spectral theory of primitive substitution rules and the symbolic dynamical systems defiend by them has a long history and is well studied , compare @xcite and references therein . nevertheless , as soon as one leaves the realm of constant length substitutions , many open questions challenge our present level of understanding .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the substitution system picture and the inflation tiling picture , where one works with natural prototile lengths , may differ considerably ; compare @xcite .",
    "the majority of the dynamical systems literature on this subject deals with the symbolic case , where work by dekking @xcite and others , see @xcite and references therein , has led to a fairly complete understanding of the constant length case , which was recently extended in a systematic fashion in @xcite , including higher dimensions . in all these cases ,",
    "the connection between the diffraction spectrum and the dynamical spectrum is rather well understood .",
    "the two notions are equivalent in the pure point case @xcite , and recent progress for symbolic systems also establishes a complete equivalence via the inclusion of certain factors @xcite .",
    "therefore , at least algorithmically , any constant length substitution can be analysed completely as far as its spectrum is concerned ; see @xcite for recent developments .",
    "the situation is less favourable outside this class .",
    "even if one stays within the realm of primitive inflation rules , the determination of the dynamical spectrum is generally difficult . here , the geometric counterpart studied in tiling theory has certain undeniable advantages .",
    "first , since such tilings are still of finite local complexity , the connection between the dynamical spectrum and the diffraction spectrum can still be used , if certain factors are included in the discussion @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we employ an approach via the diffraction spectrum of the tiling spaces .",
    "second , the geometric setting leads to the the existence of a set of _ exact _ renormalisation relations for the pair correlation coefficients of the system .",
    "we use the term ` exact ' to distinguish our approach from the widely used renormalisation schemes that are approximate or asymptotic in nature .",
    "this approach has not attracted much attention so far .",
    "in fact , we are not aware of _ any _ reference to this approach beyond the constant length case , though the principal idea has certainly been around for a while , and has been used , often in an approximate way , for several physical quantities such as electronic or transport properties ; see @xcite for an example and further references .    in this paper ,",
    "we we want to show the power of exact renormalisation relations for spectral properties , in the form of a first step via some illustrative examples . a more general approach will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "it will be instrumental for our analysis that we formulate various aspects on the symbolic level , while the core of our analysis rests on the natural geometric realisation . to make the distinction as transparent as possible",
    ", we will speak of _ substitution rules _ on the symbolic side , but of _ inflation rule _ on its geometric counterpart , thus following the notation and terminology of the recent monograph @xcite .",
    "also , various results are briefly recalled from there . rather than repeating the proofs , we provide precise references instead .",
    "below , we work along a number of examples , all of them with pisot  vijayaraghavan ( pv ) numbers as inflation multipliers . since we do _ not _ demand the characteristic polynomial to be irreducible over @xmath0 , there is still enough freedom to encounter systems with mixed spectrum .",
    "in fact , all point sets that we encounter along the way will be linearly repetitive meyer sets . an interesting linearly repetitive inflation point set with non - pv multiplier ( hence not a meyer set )",
    "will be discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . after recalling some facts about translation bounded measures on @xmath1 and their fourier transforms in section  [ sec : prelim ] ,",
    "we begin with a detailed analysis of the fibonacci substitution and inflation in section  [ sec : fibo ] .",
    "this is both a paradigm of the theory and an instructive example along which we can develop our ideas as well as further notions , wherefore this is also the longest section . here",
    ", we introduce a set of exact renormalisation equations for the general pair correlation coefficients and compare the findings with what is known from the model set description .",
    "then , we use the new approach to derive an alternative proof of the pure point nature of the diffraction spectrum , and hence also of the dynamical spectrum via the known equivalence result for this case @xcite .    after that , in section  [ sec : tm - rs ] , we briefly revisit the classic thue ",
    "morse and rudin ",
    "shapiro sequences from the renormalisation point of view .",
    "the point of this exercise is to show that our approach , in the constant length setting where the symbolic and the geometric pictures coincide , is essentially equivalent to the traditional approach as described in @xcite and recently extended in @xcite .",
    "still , there are several aspects of a more algebraic nature that seem to deserve further attention .    finally , by imposing an involutory _",
    "symmetry , we construct an extension of the silver mean chain with mixed spectrum in section  [ sec : sm - mixed ] .",
    "the main point here is that such extensions are not restricted to the constant length case ( where they are known from examples such as those of the previous section or many others as in @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , as our example indicates , there is an abundance of interesting and completely natural primitive inflation rules that produce repetitive meyer sets with mixed spectrum . in our opinion , this has hitherto been more or less neglected . for the explicit analysis ,",
    "the exact renormalisation scheme is used to determine the spectral type by a somewhat subtle application of the riemann  lebesgue lemma , which leads to a singular spectrum of mixed type .",
    "overall , we believe that the geometric picture with its exact renormalisation relations for the pair correlation coefficients provides a powerful tool also for the general case of primitive inflation rules .",
    "this will be further developed in a forthcoming publication .",

    "consequently , @xmath18 is a complex linear combination of four positive definite measures , each of which is translation bounded and transformable , hence @xmath26 is translation bounded and transformable as well .",
    "let us now briefly recall an important result on measures with meyer set support , which is due to strungaru @xcite . let @xmath27 be a repetitive meyer set , and assume that the hull of @xmath27 is uniquely ergodic under the translation action of @xmath1 .",

    "moreover , both parts , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are supported in a model set with a closed , compact window .",
    "given a cut and project scheme for @xmath27 according to @xcite , one can use the smallest such window that defines a model set cover of @xmath32 .",

    "what matters in our context , however , is not whether any height is non - trivial , but whether @xmath388 and @xmath415 have the same height .",
    "let us now look at concrete examples .",
    "our goal is to construct almost 2 - 1 extensions of the silver mean inflation ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.5 ) @xmath440 in such a way that we gain a bar swap symmetry .",
    "the scaling factor ( or inflation multiplier ) of @xmath441 is @xmath442 , and the natural tile lengths for @xmath41 ( long ) and @xmath43 ( short ) are @xmath433 and @xmath42 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath433 is a pisot unit , and it is well known that @xmath386 generates tilings with pure point spectrum ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chs .  7 and 9 ) for details .",

    "a first attempt of such an inflation could be @xmath446 it is easy to see that , for any element of the hull @xmath388 defined by @xmath397 , exactly every second tile carries a bar . as multiplication by @xmath433 induces a isomorhism on @xmath429 , this means that the module of eventual return vectors @xmath436 is an index-2 submodule of @xmath429 , whereas @xmath447 .",
    "the multiplicity of the map @xmath423 in diagram is thus @xmath49 , and the map @xmath424 is 1 - 1 a.e.in this case , so that @xmath415 still has pure point spectrum .",

    "we call it the _ twisted silver mean _ ( tsm ) inflation .",
    "it is instructive to have a closer look at @xmath415 .",
    "for that purpose , we rewrite the inflation in terms of collared tiles : @xmath451 together with @xmath452 for all @xmath453 , where @xmath454 , @xmath455 , @xmath456 , and @xmath457 .",
    "there are three variants of the long tile , and one short tile .",
    "however , since @xmath458 , we can actually merge the two prototiles @xmath285 and @xmath459 , and then rename the old @xmath269 as the new @xmath459 , so that we arrive at @xmath460 once again with @xmath461 .",
    "the hulls of @xmath462 and @xmath463 are mld , so that we can stick to the latter .",

    "mean hull .    for each prototile type ,",
    "when combining a tile with its barred version , there is an associated _ window _ in the cps @xmath464 & \\xleftarrow{\\ ; 1 - 1 \\ ; } & { \\mathcal{l } } &           \\xrightarrow{\\ ; 1 - 1 \\ ; } & { { { \\hspace{0.5pt}}\\mathbb{z}}}[\\sqrt{2}\\ , ] & \\\\     & \\| & & & & \\| & \\\\     & l & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\xrightarrow{\\qquad\\qquad\\;\\,\\star         \\,\\;\\qquad\\qquad } }          &   { l_{}}^{\\star{\\hspace{-0.5pt } } }   & \\\\ \\end{array}\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1}\\ ] ] when we distinguish according to the bars , however , we do not have a model set .",
    "nevertheless , for any fixed tiling @xmath465 , we can still take the set of left endpoints of all tiles of a given type ( which is a subset of @xmath466 = { { { \\hspace{0.5pt}}\\mathbb{z}}}[\\sqrt{2}\\,]$ ] in our setting ) , and see what the closure of the image under the @xmath61-map of this set is . in this way",
    ", we can determine a _ covering window _ for each tile type .",
    "of course , we can not expect these covering windows for the different tile types to be disjoint .",
    "the result is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : win ] .",
    "covering windows of the inflation @xmath463.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we see that a barred and an unbarred tile always share the same covering window . of course ,",
    "every left endpoint of a tile is either the endpoint of a barred or an unbarred tile , but not both .",
    "so , the identical covering windows emerge as the closure of disjoint point sets .",
    "this means that one can not determine the bar status of a tile by looking at its internal space coordinate .",
    "the bars represent a sort of _ chemical modulation _ of the original silver mean tiling , where the modulation is completely independent of internal space coordinates .",
    "another interesting point is that the hull @xmath414 of the original silver mean tiling is indeed different from @xmath415 as generated by the inflation .",
    "the latter has two long tiles , not one , and is _ not _ mld to @xmath414 . to see this ,",
    "let us look at the structure of the windows .",
    "in suitable units , the total window is an interval of length @xmath467 , which is split into three pieces of length @xmath42 , @xmath42 , and @xmath468 .",
    "the first bit belongs to the short tile , the second to one of the long tiles , and the third part is fractally split between the two long tiles .",
    "it is first assigned to one of them , but is then split in the proportion @xmath469 , and the middle part is assigned to the other long tile , where it is again split into three pieces , the middle one of which is assigned to the first long tile , and so on . although all interval boundaries showing up in this process are contained in @xmath470 = { { { \\hspace{0.5pt}}\\mathbb{z}}}[\\sqrt{2}\\,]$ ] , there is an accumulation point of interval boundaries in the middle of the subwindow of length @xmath468 , which is _ not _ contained in @xmath471 $ ] .",
    "this point represents an extra singular cut in the cps .",
    "two tilings correspond to this point , both of which project to the same silver mean tiling .",
    "this degeneracy also shows up in the cohomology . using the anderson ",
    "putnam method @xcite , it is routine to compute @xmath472 and @xmath473 , which is in line with ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.1 ) : the extra dimension comes from the extra @xmath471$]-orbit of singular points .      from the last section , we know that the tsm tiling dynamical system has a mixed spectrum .",
    "so , in addition to the well - known pure point part , there must be a continuous part in the spectrum . here",
    ", we want to investigate what the nature of this continuous part is .",
    "we have seen that the dynamical system of the twisted silver mean tiling is an almost 2 - 1 extension of the dynamical system of the original silver mean tiling . due to the bar swap symmetry ,",
    "the hilbert space of square - integrable functions on the hull , @xmath474 , is a tensor product , and can be split into an even and an odd sector under the bar swap symmetry : @xmath475 where @xmath476 is the even / odd character of the bar swap @xmath304 .",
    "the factor map induces a corresponding map on the hilbert spaces .",
    "it sends the first summand isomorphically to @xmath477 , and has the second summand as its kernel .",
    "the translation group acts on this hilbert space via a unitary representation , and leaves both sectors separately invariant .",
    "[ lem : specpure ] the spectral measure of the translation action on @xmath478 , confined to either of the two sectors @xmath479 and @xmath480 , is spectrally pure , so it has only one non - vanishing component in its lebesgue decomposition .",
    "in particular , it is a pure point measure on @xmath479 , and a continuous one on @xmath480 , where the latter is either purely singular continuous or purely absolutely continuous .",
    "this is a consequence of known results on index-@xmath49 extensions of irrational rotations ; compare @xcite . on the symbolic side ,",
    "our system is almost everywhere @xmath481 over the irrational rotation defined by the silver number .",
    "there , the claim follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.6 ) ; see also @xcite .",
    "since this purity law is a hilbert space result , it carries over to the shift space .",
    "moreover , the same result remains true if one goes to the continuous translation action of @xmath1 as obtained by a standard suspension ; see @xcite for background .",
    "our geometric setting can be viewed as a suspension with two heights . since the inflation multiplier is a pv unit , the symbolic and the geometric dynamical systems are conjugate by ( * ? ? ?",
    "the two spectral types are thus the same , and our claim follows .",
    "lemma  [ lem : specpure ] still leaves two possibilities for the spectral type in the odd sector . in order to discriminate between the two ,",
    "we look at the asymptotic behaviour of the correlation functions @xmath482 , in the same way as has been done for the thue  morse substitution . because of the purity result of lemma  [ lem : specpure ]",
    ", we can in fact take any combination of correlation functions which is odd under the bar swap .",
    "a simple such combination is the auto - correlation of a structure where the left end points of the unbarred tiles are decorated with a weight @xmath483 , and those of the barred tiles with a weight @xmath484 .",
    "so , let @xmath485 be the set of all left endpoints of tiles of a tiling @xmath465 , and set @xmath486 , if @xmath487 and @xmath488 is the left endpoint of an unbarred ( barred ) tile .",
    "with @xmath489 , the relevant autocorrelation coefficients then are @xmath490 note that we have used here the same relative normalisation as for the correlation functions of eq .  .",
    "in practice , instead of computing the limit , it is more convenient to partition @xmath485 into certain patches , which all have well - defined relative frequencies , and add up the contributions of these patches , weighted by their frequencies .",
    "we now have to determine the decay or non - decay of @xmath491 as @xmath492 .",
    "one has @xmath493 , where @xmath494 .",
    "[ nu - non - decay ]    before we do any concrete computations , let us sketch the strategy of the proof .",
    "the contributions to @xmath495 come from pairs of tiles where the left endpoint of the second tile @xmath396 is located , by a shift of @xmath496 , to the right of that of tile @xmath395 . for any such pair ,",
    "@xmath396 is the second neighbour to the right of @xmath395 .",
    "we can therefore determine all possible triples of three consecutive tiles in the tiling , and add up their contributions to the correlation at distance @xmath496 , weighted with the relative frequency of each triple .",
    "the relative frequencies can be determined by perron ",
    "frobenius theory @xcite .",
    "we regard the triples as doubly right - collared tiles , and determine the inflation matrix on the induced inflation on these collared tiles .",
    "the relative frequencies are then given by the components of the right perron ",
    "frobenius eigenvector of that matrix .    for the correlation at distance @xmath497",
    ", we do the same with triples of supertiles of order @xmath498 .",
    "these have the same relative frequencies as the triples of tiles .",
    "the pairs of tiles contributing to the correlation then consist of a left tile in the left supertile of the triple , and a corresponding right tile at distance @xmath497 , which is contained in one of the other two ( collar ) supertiles . since the underlying silver mean tiling has pure point spectrum , the density of tiles @xmath395 _ not _ having a corresponding tile @xmath396 with the same geometry at distance @xmath497 asymptotically vanishes as @xmath432 .",
    "this will become evident from the explicit computations below .    to this end",
    ", we have to look for pairs of tiles which either _ match _ ( have the same geometry and bar status ) or _ anti - match _ ( have the same geometry , but opposite bar status ) . specifically , if @xmath499 and @xmath500 are two patches of tiles with the same support , we denote by @xmath501 the number of tiles in @xmath499 that have a ( anti-)matching partner in @xmath500 at the same position .",
    "we are then interested in the _ asymptotic overlap _",
    "@xmath502 where @xmath503 the possible triples of tiles are given in table  [ tab : ttrip ] , along with their first inflations and relative frequencies .",

    "the first two triples together contribute @xmath505 .",

    "asymptotically , we get an anti - match on a fraction @xmath506 of the total patch length , which has to be weighted with the relative frequency of the triples . the third and the fifth triple each contribute an anti - match on the whole length of the patch , whereas the sixth triple contributes a match .",
    "somewhat more complicated is the contribution @xmath507 of the fourth triple .",
    "we get an anti - match due to the third tile on a fraction @xmath506 of the patch , plus @xmath508 . inflating the latter once",
    ", we obtain @xmath509 and , in a similar way , @xmath510 these equations can be solved for @xmath508 , which gives @xmath511 . putting everything together , we get @xmath512 where the relative frequencies @xmath488 , @xmath513 and @xmath101 have been taken from table  [ tab : ttrip ] .",
    "the twisted silver mean dynamical system has two spectral components , both of which are singular .",
    "the dynamical spectrum from the even sector under the bar swap is pure point , whereas that from the odd sector is purely singular continuous .    by lemma  [ lem : specpure ] ,",
    "the dynamical spectrum in the even sector is pure point , whereas in the odd sector it is continuous and of pure spectral type . by lemma  [ nu - non - decay ] ,",
    "the correlation measure @xmath514 does not decay to zero towards infinity , so that , by the riemann  lebesgue lemma and the fact that @xmath515 is uniformly discrete for a pisot inflation , its fourier transform must be singular .",
    "this implies that there must be a singular continuous component in the diffraction spectrum , and hence in the dynamical spectrum of the odd sector . as that spectrum is of pure type , it must be purely singular continuous .",
