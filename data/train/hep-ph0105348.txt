    "the interaction of protons with photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) predicts a sharp drop in the cosmic ray flux above the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff around @xmath3  ev ( greisen , 1966 ; zatsepin and kuzmin , 1966 ) .",
    "the available data shows no such drop .",
    "about 20 events above @xmath4  ev were observed by experiments such as agasa ( takeda et al . , 1998 ) , fly s eye ( bird et al . , 1993 ) , haverah park ( lawrence et al . , 1991 ) , yakutsk ( efimov et al . , 1991 ) and hires ( kieda et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "future experiments , particularly pierre auger ( boratav , 1996 ; guerard , 1999 ; bertou et al .",
    "2000 ) , will have a much higher statistics .",
    "usually it is assumed that at these energies the galactic and extragalactic ( eg ) magnetic fields do not affect the orbit of the cosmic rays , thus they should point back to their origin within a few degrees .",
    "though there are clustered events ( hayashida et al .",
    ", 1996 ; uchihori et al . , 2000 )",
    "the overall distribution is practically isotropic ( dubovski and tinyakov , 1998 ; berezinsky and mikhailov , 1999 ; medina tanco and watson , 1999 ) , which usually ought to be interpreted as a signature for eg origin . since above the gzk energy the attenuation length of particles is a few tens of megaparsecs ( yoshida and teshima , 1993 ; aharonian and cronin , 1994 ; protheroe and johnson , 1996 ; bhattacharjee and sigl , 2000 ; achterberg et al . , 1999 ; t. stanev et al . , 2000 )",
    "if an ultrahigh energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) is observed on earth it must be produced in our vicinity .",
    "sources of eg origin should result in a gzk cutoff , which is in disagreement with experiments .",
    "it is generally believed that there is no conventional astrophysical explanation for the observed uhecr spectrum .",
    "an interesting idea is that superheavy particles ( sp ) as dark matter could be the source of uhecrs . in ( kuzmin and rubakov , 1998 ) eg sps were studied .",
    "a crucial observation was made ( berezinsky et al . , 1997 ) about the decay of sps concentrated in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "they used the modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) ( azimov et al .",
    ", 1985 ; fong and webber 1991 ) for ordinary qcd and for supersymmetric qcd ( berezinsky and kachelrie , 1998 ) .",
    "a good agreement of the eg spectrum with observations was noticed in ( berezinsky et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "supersymmetric qcd is treated as the strong regime of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . to describe the decay spectrum more accurately herwig monte - carlo ( marchesini et al . , 1992 )",
    "was used in qcd ( birkel and sarkar , 1998 ) and discussed in supersymmetric qcd ( rubin 1999 , sarkar 2000 ) , resulting in @xmath5 gev and @xmath6 gev for the sp mass in sm and in mssm , respectively .",
    "sps are very efficiently produced by the various mechanisms at post inflatory epochs ( for a review see berezinsky 2000 ) .",
    "note , that any analysis of sp decay covers a much broader class of possible sources .",
    "several non - conventional uhecr sources produce the same uhecr spectra as decaying sps .    here",
    "we study the scenario that the uhecrs are coming from decaying sps and we determine the mass of this @xmath7 particle @xmath8 by a detailed analysis of the observed uhecr spectrum .",
    "we discuss both possibilities that the uhecr protons are produced in the halo of our galaxy and that they are of eg origin and their propagation is affected by cmbr . here",
    "we do not investigate how can they be of halo or eg origin , we just analyze their effect on the observed spectrum instead .",
    "we assume that the sp decays into two quarks ( other decay modes would increase @xmath8 in our conclusion ) .",
    "after hadronization these quarks yield protons .",
    "the result is characterized by the fragmentation function ( ff ) @xmath9 which gives the number of produced protons with momentum fraction @xmath10 at energy scale @xmath11 . for the proton s ff",
    "present accelerator energies can be used ( binnenwies et al . , 1995 ;",
    "kniehl et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "we evolve the ffs in ordinary ( gribov and lipatov 1972 ; lipatov 1975 ; altarelli and parisi , 1977 ; dokshitzer , 1977 ) and in supersymmetric ( jones and llewellyn smith 1983 ) qcd to the energies of the sps .",
    "this result can be combined with the prediction of the mlla technique , which gives the initial spectrum of uhecrs at the energy @xmath8 .",
    "altogether we study four different models : halo - sm , halo - mssm , eg - sm and eg - mssm .",
    "the uhecrs are most likely to be dominated by protons ( dawson et al . , 1998 ) ; in our analysis we use them exclusively .",
    "the ff of the proton can be determined from present experiments ( binnenwies et al . , 1995 ;",
    "kniehl et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the ffs at @xmath12 energy scale are @xmath13 , where @xmath14 represents the different partons ( quark , squark or gluon , gluino ) .",
    "the ffs can not be determined in perturbative qcd ; however , their evolution in @xmath15 is governed by the dglap equations ( gribov and lipatov 1972 ; lipatov 1975 ; altarelli and parisi , 1977 ; dokshitzer , 1977 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the splitting function .",
    "we solve the dglap equations numerically with the conventional qcd ( sm case ) splitting functions and with the supersymmetric ( mssm case ) ones ( jones and llewellyn smith 1983 ) .",

    "uhecr protons produced in the halo of our galaxy can propagate unaffected and the production spectrum should be compared with the observations .    particles of eg origin and energies above @xmath22 ev loose a large fraction of their energies due to interactions with cmbr ( greisen , 1966 ; zatsepin and kuzmin , 1966 ) .",
    "this effect can be quantitatively described by the function @xmath23 , the probability that a proton created at a distance @xmath24 with energy @xmath25 arrives at earth above the threshold energy @xmath26 ( bahcall and waxman 2000 ) .",
    "this function has been calculated for a wide range of parameters in ( fodor and katz , 2001a ) , which we use in the present calculation .",
    "the original uhecr spectrum is changed at least by two different ways : ( a ) there should be a steepening due to the gzk effect ; ( b ) particles loosing their energy are accumulated just before the cutoff and produce a bump .",
    "we study the observed spectrum by assuming a uniform source distribution for uhecrs .     the available uhecr data with their error bars and the best fit from a decaying sp .",
    "note that there are no events above @xmath27  ev ( shown by an arrow ) .",
    "nevertheless the experiments are sensitive even in this region .",
    "zero event does not mean zero flux , but a well defined upper bound for the flux ( given by the poisson distribution ) .",
    "therefore the experimental value of the integrated flux is in the  hatched  region with 68% confidence level .",

    "our results are insensitive to the definition of the upper end ( the flux is extremely small there ) for which we choose @xmath29 .",

    "the second one corresponds to the spectrum of the decaying sps .",
    "a and b are normalization factors .    the expectation value for the number of events in a bin is given by eqn .",
    "( [ flux ] ) and it is poisson distributed . to determine the most probable @xmath8 value we used the maximum - likelihood method by minimalizing the @xmath34 for poisson distributed data ( groom et al . , 2000 )",

    "the first bump of the fit represents particles produced at high energies and accumulated just above the gzk cutoff due to their energy losses .",
    "the bump at higher energy is a remnant of @xmath8 . in the halo models there is no gzk bump , so",
    "the relatively large @xmath10 part of the ff moves to the bump around @xmath38  gev resulting in a much smaller @xmath8 than in the eg case .",
    "the experimental data is far more accurately described by the gzk effect ( dominant feature of the eg fit ) than by the ff itself ( dominant for halo scenarios ) .",

    "our spectrum contains 94% of pions and 6% of protons .",
    "this @xmath41 ratio is in agreement with ( bhattacharjee and sigl , 2000 ; bhattacharjee and sigl , 2000 ) which showed that for different classes of models @xmath42  gev , which is the upper boundary of our confidence intervals , the generated gamma spectrum is still consistent with the observational constraints .",

    "the uhecr statistics will probably be increased by an order of magnitude ( boratav , 1996 ; guerard , 1999 ; bertou et al .",
    "performing our analysis for such a statistics the uncertainty of @xmath8 was found to be reduced by two orders of magnitude .",
    "since the decay time should be at least the age of the universe it might happen that such sps overclose the universe .",
    "due to the large mass of the sps a single decay results in a large number of uhecrs , thus a relatively small number of sps can describe the observations .",
    "we checked that in all of the four scenarios the minimum density required for the best - fit spectrum is more than ten orders of magnitude smaller than the critical one .",
