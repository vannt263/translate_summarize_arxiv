    "lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) has become a viable and promising numerical scheme for simulating fluid flows .",
    "there are several options to discretize the boltzmann equation : ( i ) standard lbm ( slbm)@xcite ; ( ii ) finite - difference lbm ( fdlbm)@xcite ; ( iii ) finite - volume lbm@xcite ; ( iv ) finite - element lbm@xcite ; etc .",
    "these kinds of schemes are expected to be complementary in the lbm studies .",
    "even though various lbms for multicomponent fluids@xcite have been proposed and developed , ( i ) most existing methods belong to the slbm@xcite , and/or based on the single - fluid theory@xcite ; ( ii ) in ref .",
    "@xcite a slbm based on sirovich s two - fluid kinetic theory@xcite is proposed ; ( iii ) nearly all the studies are focused on isothermal and nearly incompressible systems . in a recent study@xcite , sirovich s kinetic theory is clarified and corresponding two - fluid fdlbms for euler equations and isothermal navier - stokes equations are presented . in this letter",
    "we propose a two - fluid fdlbm for the complete navier - stokes equations , including the energy equation .",
    "the formulation of a fdlbm consists of three steps : ( i ) select or design an appropriate discrete velocity model ( dvm ) , ( ii ) formulate the discrete local equilibrium distribution function , ( iii ) choose a finite - difference scheme .",
    "the continuous boltzmann equation has infinite velocities , so the rotational invariance is automatically satisfied .",
    "recovering rotational invariant macroscopic equations from a discrete - finite - velocity microscopic dynamics imposes constraints on the isotropy of dvm and the finite - difference scheme used . in this letter ,",
    "the proposed fdlbm is based on the following dvm , @xmath0 \\mathtt{,}i=1% \\mathtt{,}2\\mathtt{,}\\cdots \\mathtt{,}12\\mathtt { , }   \\label{dvm1}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 indicates the @xmath1-th group of particle velocities and @xmath2 indicates the direction of the particle speed .",

    "we consider a binary mixture with two components , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where the masses and temperatures of the two components are not significantly different .",
    "the interparticle collisions can be divided into two kinds : collisions within the same species ( self - collision ) and collisions among different species ( cross - collision)@xcite .",

    "three sets of hydrodynamic quantities ( for the two components @xmath13 , @xmath14 and for the mixture ) are involved , but only two sets of them are independent .",
    "so this is a two - fluid model . without lossing generality , we focus on hydrodynamics of the two individual species . by expanding the local equilibrium distribution function @xmath22 around @xmath21 to the first order in flow velocity and temperature ,",

    "thus , a dvm being isotropic up to its @xmath61th rank tensors is enough to recover the physical isotropy of the continuous boltzmann equations to the navier - stokes level .",

    "the second one is the uniform relaxation process , which is an ideal process to indicate the equilibration behavior of the mixture@xcite . by neglecting the force terms and terms in spatial derivatives ,",

    "the highest rank of tensors of the particle velocity @xmath60 in the requirements on the truncated @xmath42 determines the needed isotropy of the dvm .",

    "say @xmath98 , only if the total masses and temperatures of the two species are not significantly different , does sirovich s kinetic theory works@xcite , so do the corresponding fdlbms .",
    "( see fig . 2 for an example .",
    ") when the masses and/or the temperatures of the two components are greatly different , the two - fluid kinetic theory should be modified . in those cases , the navier - stokes equations and the fdlbms are not symmetric about the two components , but the fdlbms can still be resolved under the d2v61 model .",
