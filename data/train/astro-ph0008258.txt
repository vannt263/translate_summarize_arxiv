    "quasars are rare , displaying the extremes of high luminosity that galactic nuclei are capable of achieving .",

    "only one optically selected quasar in a hundred shows blueshifted broad absorption lines from mg ii characteristic of a low - ionization outflow . of these `` lobal '' quasars ,",
    "only a small fraction shows high optical polarization greater than 3% ( e.g. , schmidt & hines 1999 ; ogle et al .",
    "1999 ; hutsemekers , lamy , & remy 1998 ) ; just what fraction is uncertain due to the small size of samples so far studied and heterogenous selection .",
    "furthermore , most quasars are blue and most easily selected using ultraviolet - excess techniques ; selection methods without optical color biases shows only a small population of bright red quasars ( e.g. , gregg et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "while the properties of optical polarization , red color , and low - ionization absorption are rare , they often appear together .",
    "moreover , quasars with these properties universally have strong optical fe ii emission and negligible emission from narrow forbidden lines , notably [ o iii ] @xmath75007 ( see voit et al .",
    "1993 and turnshek 1996 ) .",
    "these objects form an extreme end of quasar properties , an extreme of `` eigenvector 1 '' of boroson & green ( 1992 ) , and include objects such as i zw 1 , iras 07598 + 6508 , and narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies .",

    "becker et al . ( 1997 ) emphasized the then uniquely high radio luminosity of first j155633.8 + 351758 which places it among radio - loud quasars , although after correcting for apparent reddening the log r * measure categorizes this object as radio moderate .",
    "the moderate reddening and redshift ( @xmath9 ) conspire to make this quasar faint in optical bands ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this object has been proposed as the tip of an iceberg of red , dusty absorbed objects , akin to the earlier suggestion by webster et al .",
    "( 1995 ) of a large reddened class of quasars ; chartas ( 2000 ) notes that approximately 35% of radio - quiet gravitational lenses contain bal features and suggests that flux - limited optical surveys miss a large fraction of bal quasars .",
    "the faintness and heavy blending of the numerous strong absorption lines has made first j155633.8 + 351758 difficult to study in many respects .",
    "we have discovered another member of the red , polarized lobal quasar class also bright in the radio .",
    "moreover this new object is quite optically bright , which permits a variety of detailed studies .",

    "this yields a radio spectral index of @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is defined by s@xmath31 ) .",
    "bandwidth was the standard 50 mhz , and the source s absolute flux was determined using 3c 48 .",

    "we obtained an ultraviolet spectrum using the hubble space telescope s f/96 faint object camera ( foc ) with an objective prism on 1999 june 30 with an exposure time of 956s .",
    "the objective prism image was taken with the prism2 near - uv objective prism ( nuvop ) and provided low - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the observations were flat - fielded and geometrically corrected using the standard foc pipeline calibrations described in detail in nota et al .",
    "the dispersed images taken with the objective prism are aligned with the visible wavelengths on the lower end and the uv wavelengths at the upper end .",
    "the nuvop image has a resolution of 40   pixel@xmath12 at 5000   and 0.5   pixel@xmath12 at 1700  . a 7 pixel wide region centered on the peak of the spectrum was extracted and summed to create the raw spectrum .",
    "this was then converted from counts per pixel to flux per angstrom by applying the latest dispersion relation for the nuvop and encircled energy percentages for the extracted spectrum as given in the fov instrument handbook ( nota et al .",

    "1997 ) on the 10 meter keck ii telescope .",
    "we used a 300 line mm@xmath12 grating blazed at 5000  , that , with the 1 @xmath33 slit ( at the parallactic angle ) , gave an effective resolution of 10   ( fwhm of lamp lines ) ; the dispersion was 2.5   pixel@xmath12 .",

    "the red end of the spectrum ( @xmath35 7400 ) is weakly contaminated by second - order light at a level of @xmath36 5% ( see e.g. , ogle et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we reduced our data to one - dimensional spectra using standard techniques within the iraf noao package .",
    "the rms uncertainties in the dispersion solution were 0.2 , and we used sky lines to ensure that our zero point was accurate to 0.1 .",
    "wavelengths are air wavelengths .",

    "1997 ) for calculating stokes parameters and uncertainties .",
    "figure 2 plots our results , showing the total flux spectrum , linear polarization , position angle , and polarized flux . for clarity we have omitted error bars , but the signal - to - noise ratio is high even without binning .",
    "however for a detailed look at the polarization across the mg ii emission and absorption features , figure 3 plots a blow - up of this region with 10   binning ( done in stokes @xmath37  and @xmath38  prior to calculating @xmath39 ) and 1 @xmath40  error bars .",
    "the first result to focus on is that this quasar does indeed possess broad absorption lines . while the high polarization , red color , and deep mg ii absorption troughs are suggestive of qso 2359@xmath11241 being a low - ionization bal quasar , the absorption troughs themselves in the observed - frame optical are insufficient to make this classification .",
    "the ultraviolet spectrum shows bal troughs covering more than 8,000 km s@xmath12 .",
    "continuum placement is difficult , but we estimate that the c iv trough has a balnicity ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 ) of @xmath42300 km s@xmath12 .",
    "clearly the outflow displays a stratification in ionization and velocity , which is characterized and discussed in detail in paper ii .",
    "the spectropolarimetric properties are somewhat unusual but not atypical of bal quasars .",
    "qso 2359@xmath11241 is linearly polarized at @xmath44% and a position angle of @xmath4140@xmath22 at 8600   observed frame , rising to @xmath46% and @xmath4150@xmath22 at 4000   observed frame .",
    "the broad emission line ( i.e. mg ii ) appears unpolarized , and the polarization does not change very significantly across the absorption troughs .",
    "the total light spectrum has a redder spectrum than that of the typical blue quasar .",
    "additionally the manner in which the linear polarization rises toward shorter wavelengths is suggestive of a diminishing amount of dilution , as from a reddened direct light spectrum ( as in 3cr 68.1 , brotherton et al .",
    "1998 ) . using the color indexes defined by yamamoto & vansevicius ( 1999 ) , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and their diagnostic diagrams ,",
    "qso 2359@xmath11241 would appear to be reddened by @xmath43 using a small magellanic cloud ( smc ) extinction law as compared to the composite quasar spectrum of francis et al .",
    "we have explored the relative reddening of qso 2359@xmath11241 as compared to a composite formed from quasars in the first bright quasar survey ( brotherton et al .",
    "figure 4 shows that dereddening qso 2359@xmath11241 with an smc - type extinction law ( prevot et al .",
    "1984 ) and @xmath44 produces a good match .",
    "the match at the shortest wavelengths is complicated by the strong absorption and an increasing fraction of scattered light suggested by the rising polarization .",
    "the apparent reddening of qso 2359@xmath11241 has implications for its luminosity and radio - loudness .",
    "qso 2359@xmath11241 is bright and at moderate redshift , already indicating it is a very luminous quasar with m@xmath45 = @xmath127.9 .",
    "dereddening boosts its luminosity to m@xmath45 = @xmath128.7 .",
    "figure 5 compares these numbers to those of the more than 11000 quasars in the veron - cetty & veron ( 1998 ) catalog , revealing that a dereddened qso 2359@xmath11241 would be the third most luminous quasar at @xmath3 .",
    "the value of log r * also drops with an increased intrinsic optical luminosity , to log r * = 1.0  leaving it straddling the commonly used radio - quiet / radio - loud division .",
    "the 5 ghz rest - frame luminosity is l@xmath46 erg s@xmath12 hz@xmath12 , which is still more than an order of magnitude above the radio - quiet / radio - loud division of l@xmath47 erg s@xmath12 hz@xmath12 proposed by miller , rawlings , & saunders ( 1993 ) .",
    "the large radio emission certainly comes from the quasar , but it would appear that qso 2359@xmath11241 is overly optically luminous .",
    "qso 2359@xmath11241 is certainly a rarity among rarities .",
    "it is a radio - loud bal quasar ( although radio moderate is probably a more appropriate description as the evidence for a radio - quiet / radio - loud dichotomy has lessened ; white et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it is extremely luminous for a low redshift quasar , reminiscent of the bal quasar apm 08279 + 5255  probably the most luminous object in the known universe ( e.g. , irwin et al .",
    "1998 ) even after correction for lensing amplification .",
    "it is also reminiscent of the first discovered radio - loud bal quasar , first 1556 + 3517 ( becker et al .",
    "1997 ) , which also shows low - ionization absorption , colors suggestive of dust reddening ( clavel 1998 ; hall et al .",
    "1998 ; najita et al .",
    "2000 ) , and very high optical polarization ( brotherton et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the polarization mechanism is very likely a scattering process , as has been proposed and discussed previously for other bal quasars ( ogle et al .",
    "1999 ; schmidt & hines 1999 ; brotherton et al .",
    "1997 ; hines & wills 1995 ; cohen et al .",
    "1995 ; goodrich & miller 1995 ; glenn , schmidt , & foltz 1994 ) .",
    "the contribution from galactic interstellar polarization is negligibly small here given the very low e(b - v ) along this line of sight . while often in bal quasars the polarization rises in absorption troughs ( presumably because the scattered line of sight is less absorbed than the direct line of sight ) , it is not the case in qso 2359@xmath11241 ; higher resolution may be required to see such a rise from the rather narrow mg ii absorption features ( see arav et al .",
    "the fact that the broad emission lines are not polarized , which is also the case for the majority of bal quasars , suggests that the scattering medium is coincident with or smaller than the broad line region .",
    "the rise in the polarization toward smaller wavelengths is also commonly seen in bal quasars , as well as red non - ovv quasars ( e.g. , 3cr 68.1 , brotherton et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a strong hypothesis is that the scattered line of sight is less reddened than that to the polarization - diluting direct continuum . finally , the change in position angle with wavelength is uncommon but previously noted in bal quasars ( e.g. , ogle et al .",
    "1999 ) and suggestive of a complex geometry in which there are multiple scattered lines of sight with different amounts of reddening .",
    "arav et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that the mg ii absorption only partially covers the continuum source , and that absorption features of different ionization show different velocity structures . as has been pointed out ( e.g. , voit et al .",
    "1993 ) , lower ionization species in bal outflows appear at lower velocities .",
    "the flows and geometries of these quasars are complex .",
    "qso 2359@xmath11241 has a compact radio morphology like the vast majority of other radio - selected bal quasars ( becker et al .",
    "2000 ) , and like first 1556 + 3517 it has a flat spectrum ( @xmath48 ) . both of these properties make it likely that the geometry of qso 2359@xmath11241 is not `` edge - on '' to the system axis , which has been a popular model for polarized bal quasars and appears to be a very successful idea for explaining polarized seyfert 2 galaxies that habor hidden seyfert 1 nuclei .",
    "low - ionization bal quasars like qso 2359@xmath11241 so far observed at rest - frame optical wavelengths all have very weak or negligible [ o iii ] @xmath75007 and other lines from extended narrow line regions and have strong optical fe ii emission .",
    "qso 2359@xmath11241 also shows strong optical fe ii emission ( the multiplet near 4570   rest frame ) .",
    "these properties are also found in narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies and characterize one extreme of boroson & green s `` eigenvector 1 '' which accounts for the most variance in the optical spectra of low - redshift quasars .",
    "boroson & green ( 1992 ) also argued that the eddington fraction was the important parameter underlying the [ o iii ] @xmath75007  fe ii anti - correlation dominated eigenvector 1 .",
    "they surmised that optical fe ii emission was dependent on the covering fraction of the blr , and that more blr clouds ( and hence higher accretion rate ) would obscure the more distant nlr .",
    "thus the covering fraction increases from the radio - loud strong [ o iii ] @xmath75007 , weak fe ii quasars to the radio - quiet weak [ o iii ] @xmath75007 , strong fe ii quasars .",
    "they also noted that pg 1700 + 518 , a bal quasar , is found at the high covering fraction end .",
    "laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also argued in favor of this explanation after characterizing how the x - ray slope becomes softer ( with an increasing excess ) for quasars with small [ o iii]/fe ii .",
    "x - rays are exceedingly weak from bal quasars ( green & mathur et al .",
    "recently gallagher et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reviewed the x - ray properties of eight bal quasars targeted by _",
    "asca _ : only half were detected despite the hard energy sensitivity , and assuming normal quasar x - ray properties these non - detections imply columns with @xmath49 .",
    "we have been allocated _ chandra _ time to observe qso 2359@xmath11241 and will attempt to determine the intrinsic x - ray properties and those of the absorber likely to be present .",
    "we speculate that low - ionization bal quasars like qso 2359@xmath11241 , and other quasars at this extreme of boroson & green s eigenvector 1 , represent young or recently refueled quasars with high accretion rates and high covering fractions ( either from infalling fuel from a triggering event or outflowing debris from the engine running near the eddington limit ) .",
    "if quasars dim as they age and fuel runs out , we may expect a high fraction of the most luminous quasars to be bal quasars .",
    "we have reported the discovery of the bright radio - moderate quasar qso 2359@xmath11241 .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a bright quasar ( @xmath0 ) associated with the flat spectrum radio source nvss j235953@xmath1124148 . </S>",
    "<S> this quasar we designate qso 2359@xmath11241 possesses a rare combination of extreme properties that make it of special interest . </S>",
    "<S> these properties include : intrinsic high - velocity outflow seen in absorption for both high and low - ionization species , high optical polarization ( @xmath2 ) , significant radio emission , and dust reddening . the dereddened absolute magnitude of qso 2359@xmath11241 places it among the three most optically luminous quasars known at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> high - resolution spectroscopy and a detailed analysis of the optical / ultraviolet absorption features will be given in a companion paper ( arav et al 2000 ) . </S>"
