    "ideal hydrodynamics describes a wide variety of data from heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "in particular ideal hydrodynamics successfully predicted the observed elliptic flow and its dependence on mass , centrality , beam energy , and transverse momentum .",
    "nevertheless , the hydrodynamic approach failed in several respects .",
    "first , above a transverse momentum @xmath0 the particle spectra deviate from hydrodynamics and approach a power law .",
    "second , hbt radii are significantly too large compared to ideal hydrodynamics @xcite . considering the partial success of ideal hydrodynamics , viscous corrections may provide a natural explanation for these failures .",
    "for an ideal bjorken expansion , the entropy per unit space - time rapidity @xmath1 is conserved . for a viscous bjorken expansion the entropy per unit rapidity increases as a function of proper time @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the shear viscosity . in this equation and below",
    "we have neglected the bulk viscosity . for hydrodynamics to be valid , the entropy produced over the time scale of",
    "the expansion ( to wit , @xmath4 ) must be small compared to the the total entropy ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this leads to the requirement that @xmath6 where we have defined the _ sound attenuation length _ as @xmath7 .",
    "perturbative estimates of the shear viscosity in the plasma give @xmath8 .",
    "below we take @xmath9 , assuming that non - perturbative effects shorten equilibration times .",
    "viscosity modifies the thermal distribution function .",
    "this modification influences the observed particle spectrum and hbt correlations .",
    "the formal procedure for determining the viscous correction to the thermal distribution function is described in references @xcite .",
    "however , the basic form of the viscous correction can be intuited without calculation .",
    "first write @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the equilibrium thermal distribution function and @xmath12 is the first viscous correction .",
    "@xmath12 is linearly proportional to the spatial gradients in the system .",
    "spatial gradients which have no time derivatives in the rest frame and are therefore formed with the differential operator @xmath13 . for a baryon free fluid ,",
    "these gradients are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath14 can be eliminated in favor of the other two spatial gradients using the condition that @xmath18 and the ideal equations of motion .",
    "@xmath15 leads ultimately to a bulk viscosity and will be neglected in what follows .",
    "finally , @xmath16 leads to a shear viscosity .",
    "if @xmath12 is restricted to be a polynomial of degree less than two , then the functional form of the viscous correction is completely determined , @xmath19 for a boltzmann gas this is the form of the viscous correction adopted in this work . for bose and fermi gasses the ideal distribution function in eq .",
    "[ correction ] is replaced with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath21 is directly related to the sound attenuation length . indeed , using the distribution function in eq .",
    "[ correction ] to determine the stress energy tensor , yields a relationship between the shear viscosity @xmath3 and the coefficient @xmath21 , @xmath22 for a boltzmann gas , eq .",
    "[ tensor ] yields @xmath23 .",
    "the thermal distribution function is now completely determined . in the next section",
    "this correction is used to calculate corrections to the observables used in heavy ion collisions .",
    "to quantify the effect of viscous corrections on spectra and hbt radii , i generalize the blast wave model . in the blast wave model used here , the matter undergoes a boost invariant bjorken expansion and decouples at a proper time of @xmath24 at a temperature of @xmath25 .",
    "the matter is distributed uniformly up to a radius of @xmath26 , with velocity profile up to a maximum velocity @xmath27 .",
    "is linearly rising : @xmath28 the blast wave model with these parameters closely models the output of a full hydrodynamic simulation @xcite and gives a reasonable fit of the data .            to understand this figure qualitatively ,",
    "consider a bjorken expansion of infinitely large nuclei .",
    "the longitudinal pressure is reduced @xcite , @xmath31 . because the shear tensor is traceless , the _ transverse _ pressure is _ increased _ , @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the matter distribution is pushed out to larger @xmath33 by the shear in the longitudinal direction .",
    "more mathematically , the ratio of the corrected spectrum to the uncorrected spectrum is given by , @xmath34 for large @xmath33 we find , @xmath35 .",
    "[ spectra ] reproduces the shape and dependence of the full viscous blast wave calculation shown in fig .",
    "[ figspectra ] .",
    "viscous corrections become of order one when the @xmath33 of the particle approaches @xmath36 gev .",
    "this signals the breakdown of the hydrodynamic approach .",
    "in fact , ideal hydrodynamics generally fails to reproduce the single particle spectra above @xmath33 of 1.5 gev .",
    "viscosity provides a ready explanation for this breakdown .    in non - central collisions elliptic flow",
    "is calculated using the spectrum indicated in eq .",
    "[ eqspectra ] . in non - central collisions ,",
    "the matter is assumed to have a cylindrical distribution but the flow velocity has an elliptic component , @xmath37 . for non - central collisions",
    "the parameters are : @xmath38 and @xmath39 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figv2 ] , viscosity reduces elliptic flow by a factor of three .",
    "viscous corrections to @xmath40 and @xmath41 are large and negative . this may be understood qualitatively by again considering a simple bjorken expansion of infinite nuclei .",
    "the longitudinal pressure is reduced , @xmath42 .",
    "therefore the @xmath43 distribution ( @xmath44 ) is narrower .",
    "however , by boost invariance the single particle distribution ( @xmath45 ) is a function of @xmath46 , which yields the relation , @xmath47 the @xmath48 distribution ( @xmath49 ) at mid rapidity is therefore narrower because the longitudinal pressure is reduced .",
    "this implies that @xmath50 decreases due to the viscous longitudinal expansion . in summary",
    ", viscosity provides a simple explanation for the very large radii predicted by ideal hydrodynamics .",
