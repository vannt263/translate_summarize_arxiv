    "in such cases , adjacent solitons practically do not overlap , hence forces of the interaction between them in the periodic configuration are negligible .",
    "therefore , one may try to represent nbws as chains of fundamental solitons with identical or alternating signs : @xmath170@xmath171where @xmath102 is given by eq .",
    "( [ symmetrical_sol ] ) or eq .",
    "( symmetrical_sol2 ) .",
    "the nbw described by eq .",
    "( [ nbw1 ] ) is located at the center of the respective brillouin zone , while that given by eq .",
    "( [ nbw2 ] ) is at its edge .",
    "the conjectured composition relation between the nbw and fundamental solitons was checked numerically for the first and second soliton families , as shown in fig .",
    "9 . for other families of solitons",
    ", the composition relation also holds , in the same sense .    ) .",
    "the periodic nonlinearity - modulation profile , denoted by dash - dotted line in ( a ) , is given by eq .",
    "( [ period_g ] ) with @xmath82 , @xmath80 , and @xmath172 .",
    "the chemical potentials of the solitons and nbws in ( a ) and ( b ) are , respectively , @xmath173 and @xmath174.,width=302,height=249 ]    when the soliton width exceeds the minimum periodicity of the ol , the composition relation between nbws and fundamental solitons , as given by eqs .",
    "( [ nbw1 ] ) and ( [ nbw2 ] ) , remains essentially valid , as long as the soliton widths are smaller than two ol periods , see a typical example in fig .",
    "10 . in this case , in the cell where the soliton and nbw coexist",
    ", they overlap only in the central part of the solitons .",
    "the size of the region where the profiles of the soliton and nbw overlap is determined by the soliton s width , hence it decreases with the increase of the width .",
    "the composition relation effectively holds because the underlying gpe is almost linear in the regions where the two solitons overlaps .",
    "numerical computations also demonstrate that one can generate confined gap waves by putting several fundamental gap solitons together , with arbitrary combination of signs , cf",
    "however , as the soliton widths grows too large , the composition relation is no longer ( numerically ) valid , see fig .",
    "thus , the numerically tested composite relation remains valid as long as the width of the individual soliton does not exceed two ol periods ( when the nonlinearity is spatially homogeneous , the composite relation remains valid as long as the width of the individual soliton does not exceed one ol period , as conjectured and verified in another context in ref .",
    "we have constructed an infinite number of exact soliton solutions , both symmetric and asymmetric , in the model of the bec with the ol potential and specially devised profiles of the spatial modulation of the local attractive nonlinearity .",
    "the chemical potential of the exact solutions falls into the semi - infinite bandgap .",
    "these solitons may coexist , with different energies , at common values of the chemical potential .",
    "based on the explicit solutions , we have also found generic solitons families in the numerical form , fixing the nonlinearity - modulation profile .",
    "the stability of the numerically found solitons has been checked by means of the linear - stability analysis , and also using direct simulations .",
    "finally , we have discussed the composition relation between nonlinear bloch waves and the fundamental gap solitons .",
    "we have demonstrated numerically that the composition relation is virtually exact when widths of the solitons do not exceed the double period of the ol .",
    "when the width of solitons exceeds the ol period , the size of the spatial region where the solitons and nonlinear bloch waves overlap decreases with the increase of the soliton s width .",
