    "thermodynamics of black holes is one of the most interesting research topic , given that the thermodynamical properties of these fascinating objects are based on its elusive quantum description .",
    "one can consider black holes as states in a thermodynamical ensemble and to compare the free energy associated to each of them . in some cases",
    "phase transitions have been found .",
    "a well - known example is due to hawking and page @xcite .",
    "recently , the study of phase transitions of black holes endowed of a scalar hair has focused much interest since these transitions have been related with holographic superconductivity @xcite in the context of the ads / cft correspondence ( see relevant reviews in @xcite ) . in general , the no - hair theorems rule out such a class of solutions . however ,",
    "when a negative cosmological constant is considered , there exist exact black holes with a scalar hair and , consequently , phase transitions can be analytically studied .",
    "the first of these hairy black holes was obtained in three spacetime dimensions @xcite and then generalized @xcite by considering an one - parameter self - interaction potential .",
    "it was found @xcite that the scalar hairy black hole of ref .",
    "@xcite can decay into the btz black hole irrespective of the horizon radius .",
    "the presence of a cosmological constant also allows the existence of event horizons with non - trivial topologies .",
    "thus , a four - dimensional _ topological _ black hole dressed with a scalar field , whose event horizon is a compact space of negative curvature , was introduced in @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown the existence of a second - order phase transition at a critical temperature , below which a black hole in vacuum undergoes a spontaneous dressing up with a nontrivial scalar field .",
    "the order parameter that characterizes this transition depends on the value of the scalar field at the horizon .",
    "these results were reproduced in @xcite , and notably , it was found @xcite that this phase transition is dual to a superconductivity transition .",
    "the existence of this second - order phase transition seems to be more general @xcite .",
    "these hairy black holes can be charged by adding a maxwell gauge field .",
    "thus , an electrically charged black hole with a conformally coupled scalar field was obtained in @xcite and one with a minimally coupled scalar in @xcite . in the minimally coupled case ,",
    "phase transitions are not possible between the hairy and the non - extremal hyperbolic reissner - nordstrm ( hrn ) black holes , being the latter one thermodynamically favored .",
    "however , there is a transition where the extremal black hole without scalar field is endowed with a non - trivial scalar hair @xcite . in this report",
    "we focus the analysis in the case of the charged black hole with a conformally coupled scalar field @xcite .",
    "the main properties of this exact solution , hereafter named _ hairy black hole _ , will be reviewed in the next section . in advance",
    ", we note that the coupling constant @xmath0 of the quartic self - interaction potential plays an important role in this analysis . because we have an exact solution , it is interesting enough to explore the thermodynamical transitions of this hairy black hole .",
    "this is the aim of this brief report .",
    "we apprise to the readers that the question about how these phase transitions are or not related to a superconductivity transition will be not discussed here .",
    "previous attempts have dealt with to describe phase transitions in the hairy black hole . however , these treatments have some problems . in @xcite",
    "the free energy is computed using an expression for the entropy with an incorrect factor . in this case the scalar field is conformally coupled to gravity .",
    "consequently , in the area law for the entropy an  effective \" newton constant , depending on the value scalar field at the horizon , must be considered .",
    "more recently , it was argued that a second - order transition from a hairy to a hrn black hole is unlikely possible to occur @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis in @xcite is not clear for lack of a thermodynamical ensemble . in order to solve these problems ,",
    "we develop a detailed study of phase transitions for the hairy black hole in section [ transiciones ] .",
    "the results show the existence of two phase transitions of different order .",
    "one of them corresponds to a second order transition , which occurs at a fixed temperature defined only in terms of the cosmological constant . on contrary , the other transition is of first order and the critical temperature strongly depends on @xmath0 .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the main properties of hairy and hrn black holes . we start considering four - dimensional gravity with a cosmological constant , where the matter content is given by a conformally coupled real self - interacting scalar field and a maxwell gauge field .",
    "the action is given by @xmath1&=&\\int d^4x\\sqrt{-g}\\left[\\frac{r-2\\lambda}{16\\pi g}-\\frac{f^{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\mu\\nu}}{16\\pi } \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\left .",

    "when the cosmological constant is negative , @xmath3 , the theory admits an exact solution @xcite , which we have called hairy black hole , and whose line element is @xmath4dt^2 \\nonumber \\\\&+&\\left[\\frac{r^2}{l^2}-\\left(1+\\frac{g\\mu}{r}\\right)^2\\right]^{-1}dr^2 + r^2d\\sigma^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression @xmath5 is the line element of a negative constant curvature two - dimensional manifold , which is assumed to be compact and with volume @xmath6 .",
    "the scalar field reads @xmath7 and the electromagnetic potential has the simple form @xmath8 the constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 are not independent , they are related in the following way @xmath11 where @xmath12 because @xmath9 is real .",
    "if @xmath10 is positive the black hole has a single horizon .",
    "on the other hand , in the case @xmath13 the solution have three horizons .",
    "the extreme black hole occurs for @xmath14 , where two horizons take the value @xmath15 .    other solution of this theory is the hrn black hole @xcite , which is obtained from ( [ action ] ) provided that @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding metric is @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the integration constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 are independent and they are proportional to the mass and electric charge respectively .",
    "the electromagnetic potential read @xmath21 .",
    "the event horizon is located at @xmath22 , which satisfies the equation @xmath23 the hrn black hole becomes an extremal one when @xmath19 and @xmath20 hold the following relations @xmath24",
    "in this section , we will compare the free energy of hairy black and hrn black holes . in @xcite , the free energy , as well as other thermodynamical quantities ,",
    "were computed for the hairy black hole using the grand canonical ensemble . in this ensemble the temperature @xmath25 , or equivalently its inverse @xmath26 , and the potential difference @xmath27 are fixed . then , the free energy @xmath28 is a function of @xmath25 and @xmath29 and it has the following expression @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 denote the mass , the electric charge , and the entropy , respectively . for the hairy black hole",
    ", we have @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 stands for the effective newton constant @xmath37 as it was noted in @xcite , the entropy is positive provided that @xmath10 is bounded by specific values , which depend on @xmath38 . in terms of the temperature",
    ", this condition states that it must range in the interval @xmath39 , where @xmath40    for the hrn black hole , the thermodynamical variables are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 in order to find phase transitions between the hairy and undressed states , we must consider both black holes in a same grand canonical ensemble , i.e. at the same @xmath25 and @xmath29 . equaling @xmath25 and @xmath29 for both black holes , from eqs .",
    "( [ tqcmtz ] ) and ( [ tqhrn ] ) we obtain the conditions @xmath43 the above conditions become identities when one express , using eqs .",
    "( [ tqcmtz ] ) and ( [ tqhrn ] ) , @xmath44 , @xmath9 , @xmath45 , and @xmath20 in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath29 . however , the algebraic manipulation is more simple if eqs .",
    "( [ tqcmtz ] ) , ( [ tqhrn ] ) and ( [ equal ] ) are used at the same time .",

    "for this reason @xmath49 in ( [ delta ] ) can be expressed in terms of a single variable . in this case , the temperature was chosen .",
    "we find that the phase diagram has a strong dependence of the parameter @xmath38 , which is proportional to the inverse of the coupling constant @xmath0 . in the fig . 1 , we have illustrated the behavior of @xmath49 for two values of @xmath38 . for all values of @xmath38 , i. e. @xmath50 , there is a phase transition at the critical temperature @xmath51 .",
    "this is a second - order phase transition because @xmath49 and its derivative vanish at @xmath52 as it can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , and confirmed by the series expansion of @xmath49 around @xmath52 @xmath53 in a similar way , as it was discussed for uncharged black holes @xcite ( the uncharged case corresponds to set @xmath54 here ) , in the range @xmath55 the undressed ( hrn ) black hole is thermodynamically favored . however , below the critical temperature , the hairy black hole is preferred .    ,",
    "of hairy and hrn black holes versus the temperature @xmath25 , computed in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the figure consider two cases depending on the values of the parameter @xmath56 . in the @xmath57 case",
    ", there is a second order - phase transition at @xmath51 . for the case",
    "@xmath58 , additionally to the second - order phase transition at @xmath52 , there is a first - order one at the temperature @xmath59 .",
    ", width=302 ]    when @xmath60 we find another solution for @xmath61 , denoted by @xmath59 , as it is shown for @xmath58 in fig .",
    "this second temperature monotonously increases with @xmath38 and it asymptotically approaches to @xmath52 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . however , only when @xmath62 this temperature is higher than @xmath63 , which is the minimum temperature required for ensuring a positive entropy for the hairy black hole .",
    "thus , different to the uncharged case , there is another phase transition provided @xmath64 .",
    "this new phase transition is of first order because the slope of @xmath49 at @xmath59 does not vanish ( fig .",
    "additionally , one can includes the extreme hrn black hole into the analysis .",
    "for extreme black holes , @xmath26 becomes arbitrary and the entropy vanishes @xcite .",
    "we set this extreme black hole in the previous ensemble , and using eq .",
    "( [ extremo ] ) , the free energy takes the form @xmath65^{3/2}.\\ ] ] for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 is greater than the free energy corresponding to the non - extremal case , which indicates a thermal decay of the extreme into the non - extreme hrn black hole and none phase transition is observed .",
    "this is the same result as in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath69 and @xmath70 are compared , we note that the difference @xmath71 vanishes for two different temperatures @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath72 appears only for @xmath74 , being @xmath75 in the interval @xmath76 .",
    "this could be a signal of the existence of a phase transition at @xmath77 and another one , for @xmath78 , at @xmath72 .",
    "however , since @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) they do not lie within the physical temperature interval @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , there are no phase transitions between the hairy black hole and the extremal hrn one . moreover , since @xmath69 is greater than @xmath70 and @xmath82 within the proper temperature range , the extremal black hole is able to decay into the hairy or into the non - extremal hrn black hole with different branching ratios .",
    "finally , as it was mentioned before , the hairy black hole contains an extremal case .",
    "for this extreme black hole , the mass and the charge are fixed in terms of the parameters appearing in the action .",
    "thus , it is easy to prove that a ) only the case of vanishing temperature is compatible with the assumed ensemble , and b ) the value of the free energy for the extreme hairy black hole coincides with the @xmath83 limit of @xmath70 as it is expected .     and",
    "@xmath84 enclose the region where the entropy of the hairy black hole is positive .",
    "these curves approach to @xmath85 for @xmath86",
    ". there is a second - order phase transition at @xmath52 for all values @xmath87 . for @xmath64",
    "an additional first - order transition appears and it takes place at @xmath59 , which is higher than @xmath63 within this range of @xmath38 .",
    "the hairy phase ( shared region ) dominates in the region bounded by @xmath88 for @xmath89 , and @xmath90 for @xmath64 .",
