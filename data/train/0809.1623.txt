    "after the leading work by morris and thorne @xcite , traversable lorentzian wormholes @xcite have received considerable attention .",
    "such geometries connect two regions of the same universe or of two universes by a traversable throat .",
    "a central objection against the existence of wormholes is that , within the framework of general relativity , the flare - out condition @xcite to be satisfied at the throat requires the presence of exotic matter , that is , matter which violates the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the amount of exotic matter necessary for the existence of a wormhole can be made infinitesimally small by suitably choosing the geometry , though it may be at the expense of large stresses at the throat @xcite . on the other hand , it was demonstrated that in some alternative theories of gravity the requirement of exotic matter can be avoided @xcite ; in particular , some years ago , anchordoqui _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that , in brans ",
    "dicke gravity , lorentzian wormholes of the morris ",
    "thorne type are compatible with matter which , apart from the brans  dicke scalar field , satisfies the energy conditions .",
    "other related aspects of wormholes in brans - dicke or in scalar - tensor theories were also discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thin - shell wormholes @xcite are mathematically constructed by cutting and pasting two manifolds to yield another one with a throat placed at the joining surface . the mechanical stability and the matter content of spherically symmetric wormholes of this kind",
    "have been studied by several authors , both within general relativity @xcite and in alternative theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "other geometries were also recently explored @xcite . in the present work",
    "we apply the darmois ",
    "israel formalism @xcite generalized to brans ",
    "dicke gravity @xcite for the construction of spherically symmetric thin - shell wormholes .",
    "we calculate the energy density and the pressure on the shell .",
    "we find that for certain values of the brans  dicke constant @xmath0 , the wormhole radius can be chosen so that the matter on the shell satisfies the energy conditions , being the existence of the throat made possible by the presence of the brans  dicke field . throughout the paper units such that @xmath1 are used .",
    "in the framework of present unified theories , a scalar field should exist besides the metric of the spacetime .",
    "scalar - tensor theories of gravitation would be important when studying the early universe , where it is supposed that the coupling of the matter to the scalar field could be nonnegligible . in brans ",
    "dicke theory , matter and non gravitational fields generate a long - range scalar field @xmath2 which , together with them , acts as a source of gravitational field .",
    "the metric equations generalizing those of general relativity are r_-g_r= t_+_,_,- g__,^,+_;;-g _ _ : ^ ; , where @xmath3 is the ricci tensor , @xmath4 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter and fields not including the brans  dicke field and @xmath0 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "the field @xmath2 is a solution of the equation _ ; ^;= (  g^)= , where @xmath5 is the trace of @xmath6 . in the limit @xmath7",
    "the einstein equations are recovered , provided that @xmath8 . in brans  dicke theory , the junction conditions across a smooth timelike hypersurface @xmath9 in the four dimensional manifold , can be obtained by projecting on @xmath9 the equations above . the extrinsic curvature associated with the two sides of @xmath9 in terms of the unit normals @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the coordinates of the four dimensional manifold , @xmath14 are the coordinates on the hypersurface , and @xmath15 are the components of the connection associated with the metric @xmath16 . then , with this definition , the junction conditions in brans  dicke theory ( generalized darmois ",
    "israel conditions ) have the form @xcite @xmath17 where the notation @xmath18 stands for the jump of a given quantity across the hypersurface @xmath9 , @xmath19 labels the coordinate normal to this surface and @xmath20 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter and fields ( except the field @xmath2 ) on the shell located at @xmath9 . the quantities",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the traces of @xmath23 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the components of the metric and the brans  dicke field are continuous across the shell ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "note that in the general relativity limit @xmath7 the lanczos equations @xcite are recovered .",
    "now let us apply the formalism introduced above to the construction of spherically symmetric thin - shell wormholes . we start from the metric ds^2=- f(r)dt^2 + g(r)dr^2 + h(r)(d^2+^2d^2 ) , so that @xmath26 . from this geometry",
    "we choose a radius @xmath27 and take two copies @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the region @xmath30 , and paste them at the hypersurface @xmath9 defined by @xmath31 , obtaining a new manifold @xmath32 .",
    "the radius @xmath27 is chosen so that there are no horizons and singularities in @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 is positive the flare - out condition is satisfied , and the resulting geometry describes a wormhole having a throat of radius @xmath27 connecting the two regions @xmath28 and @xmath29 . introducing the coordinates @xmath35 on @xmath9 ( with @xmath36 the proper time on the shell ) , the jump of the components of the extrinsic curvature is given by k_^= , k_^= k_^=. then the energy density @xmath37 and the pressures @xmath38 of the matter and fields in the shell ( apart from the field @xmath2 ) are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the value of the brans  dicke field on the surface @xmath9 .",

    "if the field @xmath56 is not constant , the geometry presents a naked singularity with radius @xmath57 . to construct the wormhole , we take @xmath58 or @xmath59 so that @xmath60 , and a throat radius larger than @xmath61 .",
    "as @xmath62 should be real and non zero , it follows that @xmath63 if @xmath58 and that @xmath64 can take any value if @xmath59 . in the case",
    "@xmath65 we have that @xmath66 @xmath67 and the flare out condition is satisfied ; it happens when @xmath68 , for @xmath58 , and when @xmath69 or @xmath70 , for @xmath59 . replacing the explicit form of the metric and field , we have @xmath71 with the constraint obtained from eq .",

    "( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "if both inequalities above are satisfied the weak energy condition is not violated , and then the matter on the shell is not exotic .",
    "the throat radii such that conditions ( [ sigma3 ] ) and ( [ s+p2 ] ) are fulfilled are respectively displayed in figures 1 and 2 for some relevant values of the brans  dicke constant @xmath72 and the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath73 .",
    "the figure 3 shows where both conditions are simultaneously satisfied , so that configurations defined by such values contain non exotic matter in the shell placed at the wormhole throat .",
    "we see that this happens for @xmath58 , and the radius @xmath27 slightly greater than @xmath57 .",

    "we have obtained the energy density and the pressure of matter and fields other than @xmath2 , in the shell placed at the throat of the wormhole .",
    "we have shown that , for certain negative values of the brans  dicke constant , this matter satisfies the energy conditions if the throat radius is suitably chosen .",
    "such values of the constant @xmath0 seem to be unphysical in the present universe , but they could make sense in another scenario ( i.e. far in the past ) .",
    "if the right hand side of eq .",

    ", we would have that = -s^_= - is negative because of the flare - out condition .",
    "so , in this picture , the energy conditions are not satisfied by this effective surface tensor .",
    "the violation of these conditions comes from the brans  dicke field , even in the presence of non exotic matter and other fields .",
