    "the fermionic hubbard model is one of the main models used for the description of strong electron correlations in crystals such as cuprate perovskites and heavy fermion compounds .",
    "the strong coupling diagram technique @xcite is one of the approximate approaches used for investigating the model .",
    "the method is based on the serial expansion in powers of the electron kinetic energy .",
    "the elements of the arising diagram technique are on - site cumulants of electron creation and annihilation operators and hopping lines connecting cumulants on different sites . as in the diagram technique with the expansion in powers of an interaction , in the considered approach",
    "the linked - cluster theorem allows one to discard disconnected diagrams and to carry out partial summations in remaining connected diagrams . as a consequence the electron green s function is expressed in the form of the larkin equation containing the initial electron dispersion and the irreducible part  the sum of all irreducible diagrams without external ends . in spite of the fact that by the construction the approach is intended for the case of strong coupling , when the hubbard repulsion @xmath9 is approximately equal to or larger than the initial bandwidth @xmath5 , it gives the correct result in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "hence the approach provides an interpolation between the limits of weak and strong correlations .    using this method , in recent work @xcite equations for the electron green s function",
    "were obtained by keeping terms of the lowest two orders in the irreducible part of the larkin equation .",
    "self - consistent calculations performed for the semi - elliptical density of states ( dos ) showed that at half - filling the approximation describes the mott transition , which occurs at @xmath11 .",
    "this value coincides with the critical repulsion obtained for the same dos in the hubbard - iii approximation @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the same method was applied to the half - filled two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model with nearest neighbor form of the kinetic energy ( the @xmath12-@xmath9 model ) . in this case",
    "the mott transition is observed at @xmath4  the value , which is very close to that for the semi - elliptical dos .",
    "the used approach allows one to describe not only the mott transition , but also another important feature of the model ",
    "spectral continua , which lead to finite widths of spectral maxima .",
    "spectral functions , dos and momentum distributions calculated in the @xmath12-@xmath9 model were in qualitative and in some cases quantitative agreement with monte carlo data .    in the present work",
    "the equations derived in @xcite are self - consistently solved for different electron concentration @xmath0 and for the kinetic energy containing nearest and next nearest neighbor hopping terms ( the @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath9 model ) .",
    "similar dispersions are frequently used for the description of hole - doped cuprates with the ratio of the next nearest neighbor to nearest neighbor hopping constants close to @xmath14 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at half - filling and for this ratio of @xmath15 the mott transition",
    "is observed again at @xmath4 , close to the values mentioned above .",
    "comparison of calculated spectral functions with available monte carlo results for the case @xmath7 and @xmath6 shows not only qualitative , but in some cases quantitative agreement in positions of maxima .",
    "general spectral shapes , their evolution with wave vector and concentration in the wide range @xmath2 are also close .",
    "these facts and relative simplicity of calculations give promise that the considered approach can be applied for investigating multi - band generalizations of the hubbard model , for example , such as used for the description of iron pnictides or transition - metal oxides .",
    "it was found that the behaviour of the mott gap with changing @xmath0 is different in the @xmath12-@xmath9 and @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath9 models . in all considered cases positions of maxima in spectral functions are close to the frequencies of @xmath16-function peaks in the hubbard - i approximation @xcite .",
    "in this section some equations derived in @xcite are reproduced and converted to the form , which is convenient for calculations .",
    "the electron green s function @xmath17 is considered , where the angular brackets denote the statistical averaging with the hubbard hamiltonian @xmath18 @xmath19 is the hopping constants , the operator @xmath20 creates an electron on the site * n * of the 2d square lattice with the spin projection @xmath21 , the electron number operator @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the chemical potential , @xmath24 is the time - ordering operator which arranges operators from right to left in ascending order of times @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "green s function ( [ green ] ) does not depend on the spin projection , and it was omitted in the function notation .    in the strong coupling diagram technique ,",
    "after the summation of all diagrams the fourier transform of green s function ( [ green ] ) acquires the form of the larkin equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the 2d wave vector , @xmath30 is the matsubara frequency with the temperature @xmath31 , @xmath32t_{\\bf nn'}$ ] and @xmath33 is the irreducible part  the sum of all irreducible diagrams without external ends .",
    "a diagram is said to be an irreducible one if it can not be divided into two disconnected parts by cutting some hopping line @xmath19 .    in this work @xmath33",
    "is approximated by the sum of two terms of the lowest orders in powers of @xmath34 .",
    "these terms contain cumulants of the first and second orders .",
    "the term with the second - order cumulant includes also a hopping - line loop . using the possibility of the partial summation of diagrams we transform this bare hopping line into the dressed one , @xmath35 where @xmath36 . with this substitution ,",
    "for a chemical potential in the range @xmath37 the expression for the @xmath33 reads @xmath38\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad+\\frac{3}{4}f^2(i\\omega_l)\\phi(i\\omega_l ) -\\frac{s_1}{2}f(i\\omega_l)-\\frac{s_2}{2}j(i\\omega_l),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the number of sites .",
    "we chose @xmath41 and used this relation in deriving ( [ k_gen ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ larkin ] ) , ( [ k_gen ] ) and ( [ variables ] ) form the closed set of equation for calculating green s function ( [ green ] ) . notice that irreducible part ( [ k_gen ] ) does not depend on momentum as the approximation does not take into account the interactions of electrons with the magnetic ordering , spin and charge fluctuations . in the used approach",
    "these interactions are described by the sum of diagrams containing ladders , which correspond to the dynamic spin and charge susceptibilities @xcite .    for further consideration",
    "we perform the analytic continuation to real frequencies @xmath42 and transform the sums @xmath43 and @xmath44 to the form more convenient for calculations using the spectral representations , poisson summation formulas and inequalities ( [ mu_range ] ) , @xmath45 from ( [ larkin ] ) , ( [ k_gen ] ) and ( [ variables ] ) we get @xmath46\\bigg\\}^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a self - consistent solution @xmath47 of ( [ s1_2 ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) is used in ( [ k_gen ] ) and ( [ larkin ] ) for calculating green s function .",
    "as follows from ( [ k_gen])([phi ] ) , frequencies @xmath48 and @xmath49 are somehow singled out . at half - filling and in the case of a dos , which is symmetric with respect to @xmath50 ,",
    "the sums @xmath43 and @xmath44 vanish .",
    "as follows from ( [ phi ] ) , in this case @xmath47 behaves near @xmath51 as ( see also @xcite ) @xmath52 substituting this result into ( [ k_gen ] ) we see that @xmath53 diverges as @xmath54 .",
    "this fact presents a problem because up to a multiplier @xmath53 is a spectral function for momenta meeting the condition @xmath55 [ see ( [ larkin ] ) ] , which due to the divergence does not satisfy neither the normalization condition @xmath56 nor the kramers - kronig relation @xmath57 to overcome this difficulty in @xcite we introduced an artificial broadening . however , if an initial dos is not symmetric ( as for the case @xmath58 ) and/or @xmath59 the divergence disappears . indeed , in this case @xmath43 and @xmath44 in ( [ s1_2 ] ) are nonzero , and from ( [ phi ] ) we get near @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath60 here @xmath47 is purely real and , therefore , @xmath61 .",
    "this poses another difficulty : as follows from calculations , for @xmath62 narrow gaps with nearly vertical walls appear in @xmath53 around @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "thanks to their narrowness and shape , these unphysical gaps can be easily eliminated by a linear interpolation between tops of the walls .",
    "results of this section were obtained by the self - consistent solution of ( [ s1_2 ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) for a given @xmath23 in the @xmath12-@xmath9 or @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath9 models .",
    "the solution was found by iteration .",
    "such obtained @xmath47 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 were used for calculating @xmath53 from ( [ k_gen ] ) . after removing the gaps near @xmath48 and @xmath49 with the interpolation and normalization ( [ norm ] ) ,",
    "@xmath53 is used for calculating @xmath63 from ( [ kkr ] ) , which allows one to calculate green s function ( [ larkin ] ) for arbitrary * k*. such obtained spectral functions @xmath64 and dos @xmath65 satisfy the usual normalization conditions with good accuracy .    to check the validity of the used approach its results",
    "were compared with data of monte carlo simulations carried out in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this comparison is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . here and below @xmath12 and the intersite distance are set as units of energy and length , respectively .",
    "the electron concentration was determined from the relation @xmath66 where @xmath31 was set equal to 0 , since in the used approximation equations do not depend on @xmath31 and actually correspond to @xmath67 . comparing our and monte carlo results it should be borne in mind that due to the sign problem the latter were obtained at comparatively high temperature @xmath68 .",
    "this leads to increased widths of maxima in comparison with zero - temperature results .",
    "we did not try to fit widths of maxima in our spectra to monte carlo data by an artificial broadening .",
    "this was done to demonstrate real spectral shapes , which appear in the present approach . besides , monte carlo spectra for real frequencies were obtained by analytic continuation of imaginary - frequency data using the maximum - entropy method .",
    "this method introduces additional inaccuracies in spectral shapes .    keeping these remarks in mind , from figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we can conclude that the used approach gives spectral functions in qualitatively and in some cases quantitatively agreement with the monte carlo data in the wide range of electron concentrations @xmath2 ( see also the analogous comparison for the case of half - filling in @xcite ) .",
    "locations of maxima , general shapes of spectra and their variation with * k * and @xmath0 are as a rule close . substantial differences in widths of maxima , observed in some spectra , may be related to the above - mentioned reasons . a similar picture is observed also in the comparison of monte carlo @xcite and our results for @xmath69 ( not shown here ) .",
    "arrows in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] indicate frequencies of @xmath16-function peaks in the hubbard - i approximation , @xmath70 as for the case of half - filling @xcite , one can see that in the used approximation locations of maxima are close to these frequencies .",
    "widths of spectral maxima are essentially increased away from half - filling .",
    "this may be observed in the evolution of the dos with changing @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . due to the particle - hole symmetry of the @xmath12-@xmath9 model",
    "only cases @xmath71 are shown .",
    "the dos for @xmath72 can be obtained from the respective case @xmath73 by the specular reflection in the line @xmath74 . as already noted earlier @xcite , with deviation from half - filling the dos",
    "is redistributed in favor of the hubbard subband , in which the fermi level is located .",
    "the mott gap decreases monotonously with growing @xmath75 and disappears at @xmath76 .",
    "similar behaviour is observed in the dos of the @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath9 model shown in fig .",
    "however , in this case the width of the mott gap reaches its maximum value at @xmath77 rather than at @xmath78 , as in the @xmath12-@xmath9 model . in the @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath9 model",
    "the maximal gap width is somewhat larger ",
    "@xmath79 at @xmath7 and @xmath3 in comparison with @xmath80 at @xmath6 .",
    "the dependence of the gap width on @xmath81 is strongly asymmetric in the @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath9 model . at half - filling , keeping @xmath3 and decreasing",
    "@xmath9 we found that the gap disappears at @xmath82 .",
    "this value of the critical repulsion is very close to those found for the semi - elliptical dos @xcite and in the @xmath12-@xmath9 model @xcite . for the used parameters the positions of maxima in spectral functions of the @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath9 model are also close to those in the hubbard - i approximation , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "in this work , equations for the electron green s function of the repulsive hubbard model , derived using the strong coupling diagram technique , were self - consistently solved for different electron concentrations @xmath0 in the two - dimensional @xmath12-@xmath9 and @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath9 models .",
    "terms of the first two orders in the expansion in powers of @xmath83 were taken into account in the irreducible part of the equation for green s function , and the bare internal hopping line in one of these terms was substituted with the dressed one .",
    "comparison of spectral functions , calculated in the @xmath12-@xmath9 model for the hubbard repulsion @xmath7 , with monte carlo data shows not only qualitative but in some cases quantitative agreement in positions of maxima .",
    "general spectral shapes , their evolution with the wave vector and electron concentration in the wide range @xmath2 are also similar . it was found that in the half - filled @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath9 model with @xmath14 the mott transition occurs at @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the initial bandwidth .",
    "this critical value is close to those found for the semi - elliptical density of states and in the case @xmath6 .",
    "the behaviour of the mott gap is different in the cases @xmath6 and @xmath3 : the maximal gap width is larger in the latter case and is reached at @xmath8 rather than at half - filling , as in the case @xmath6 . in both cases positions of spectral maxima are close to those in the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "the conducted comparison with monte carlo results and comparative simplicity of calculations give promise that the strong coupling diagram technique may be a useful tool in consideration of different generalizations of the hubbard model such as multi - band models used for the description of transition - metal oxides or models containing external fields .",
