    "[ fig:7 ] which shows that an increasing @xmath6 , at fixed @xmath19 reestablishes field growth where turbulent fluctuations had previously suppressed the dynamo . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] shows that the correlation length and constant @xmath32 increase with @xmath19 and eventually asymptote when the conductivity is effectively reduced by @xmath164 % .",
    "the simulated turbulence has no _ de facto _ scale separation .",
    "this might appear to pose a problem , given that our interpretation of the effect of turbulence is the introduction of a turbulent resistivity , and the turbulent resistivity of mean field theory ( mft ) @xcite is usually couched in scale separation arguments .",
    "however , it should be noted that the scale separation requirement associated with the @xmath165 and @xmath166 effects of mft does not enter into the form of @xmath166 , but does guarantee that @xmath167 .",
    "this is because @xmath165 is proportional to helicity whereas @xmath166 is proportional to energy while @xmath165 multiplies a lower derivative of the mean field than does @xmath166 . in this sense",
    "the lack of scale separation in the simulations is consistent with the apparent weakness of a turbulent-@xmath165 effect in a regime with a turbulent resistivity .",
    "while the simulations are limited to @xmath168 by computational speed and storage , we believe the simulations capture the dominant effect since the fluctuations at the largest scales are the strongest contributers to the turbulent resistivity by the following argument . in kolmogorov turbulence @xcite",
    "the spectrum is @xmath169 , where @xmath104 is the energy dissipation rate .",
    "thus the turbulent resistivity goes as @xmath170^{-1/2}\\sim \\epsilon^{1/3}k_0^{-4/3}$ ] , where @xmath171 is the wavenumber of the large scale eddies and @xmath172 is the dissipation scale wavenumber . in k41 turbulence , @xmath173 ,",
    "as @xmath19 becomes large in comparison to @xmath6 , the effect of turbulent fluctuations on conductivity will asymptote to a fixed value .",
    "it should be noted that the simple dimensional analysis used for estimating the turbulent resistivity reflects isotropic homogenous turbulence and is derived in the limit that there is no mean flow ; this dynamo relies almost entirely on the presence of a mean flow .",
    "an alternative viewpoint , consistent with the phenomenological interpretation of enhanced resistivity put forward here , is that the large - scale variations in the velocity field are continuously changing the spatial structure and growth rates of the magnetic eigenmodes of the system .",
    "a more thorough treatment of the dynamic variation of dominant eigenmodes can be found for a slightly different problem in @xcite .",
    "two effects can be important .",
    "first , the instantaneous growth rate of the least damped eigenmode fluctuates between growing and damped . for a run with @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , a dynamo occurs only when the flow spends sufficient time in phases which are kinematic dynamos .",
    "the kinematic growth rate is most often positive , consistent with the time averaged flow having growing magnetic field solutions , yet the modifications made to the flow during the subcritical periods are sufficient to stop the dynamo .",
    "second , the turbulence couples energy from the growing magnetic eigenmode into spatially - similar damped eigenmodes . as the flows evolve , the spatial structure of the eigenmodes change .",
    "the magnetic field structure of a single eigenmode at some previous instant in time must be described in terms of several modes after the flow changes .",
    "this transfer of energy from the primary mode is equivalent to enhanced dissipation .",
    "analysis of the eigenmode structure shows that the least damped eigenmode during a nondynamo phase in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] varies between the marginally stable nonaxisymmetric dipole and a stable axisymmetric magnetic mode .",
    "thus the flow imparts energy to a spatially similar , but distinct magnetic eigenmode .",
    "finally , it should be noted that distinguishing between growing and damped magnetic fields is difficult in the turbulent simulations .",
    "typically , the turbulent runs have been limited to durations of less than 10 @xmath177 .",
    "the transition may also be considerably more complex as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] where magnetic energy of the @xmath124 simulation may show intermittent growth near @xmath155 .",
    "the simulations are thus consistent with intermittent excitation of the dynamo eigenmode by the mean flow .",
    "the peak magnetic energy is limited by the magnitude of the initialized noise the simulation is started with instead of the backreaction with the flow .",
    "this effect is especially relevant when the magnetic field is sustained by an external source as shown in section [ sec : applied ] .",
    "a dynamo still occurs in these flows for sufficiently large @xmath6 ( keeping @xmath19 fixed , growing magnetic energy is detected for sufficiently large @xmath20 ) .",
    "an example of a time evolution and spatial structure of a saturated turbulent magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] for a simulation with @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "an @xmath114 transverse dipole field is still present , as in the case of the laminar dynamo in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , however this turbulent dynamo is now dominated by the presence of a large @xmath180 field , aligned with the axis of symmetry of the impellors as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9](b ) .",
    "this component , by itself , would appear to violate cowling s theorum @xcite , and so it must result from non - axisymmetric components of the velocity field and the magnetic field .",
    "thus it appears probable that the nature of dynamo has changed fundamentally from a simple eigenmode driven by the two vortex flow , to a dynamo in which the turbulent fluctuations may be responsible for generating the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "as a means of further highlighting the different physics and conditions underlying turbulent and laminar dynamos , subcritical flows are simulated with focus on the potential role of fluctuation driven currents in the self - excitation process .",
    "subcritical flows have @xmath118 , and are not expected to lead to self - excited magnetic fields .",
    "the mhd behavior is investigated by applying a magnetic field which is generated by currents flowing in coils external to the sphere .",
    "the configuration studied is similar to the set of experiments described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and is deliberately set up as an axisymmetric system in which fluctuation driven currents can be easily detected .",
    "the numerical technique employed is similar to the dynamo simulations described above in all but one respect , namely a different boundary condition is used with @xmath181 in eq .",
    "[ eq : bpbc ] .",
    "these boundary conditions match the magnetic field to a scalar magnetic potential @xmath182 , which is valid in the region between the surface of the sphere and the external magnets .",
    "@xmath183 satisfies laplace s equation and its solution is well known : @xmath184 where @xmath185 s are the spherical harmonics .",
    "the @xmath186 terms represent the magnetic field generated by currents in the sphere , and the coefficients @xmath187 can be chosen to describe a magnetic field of arbitrary shape and orientation applied by currents external to the sphere . in this paper and in the simulations described below , a uniform magnetic field",
    "is applied along the symmetry axis of the forcing terms , and is characterized by a single coefficient @xmath188 , all higher order terms being zero .",
    "the applied magnetic field , @xmath189 , is weak enough so that it does not alter the large - scale flow .",
    "the strength of the applied magnetic field is moderated by keeping the stuart number @xmath190 . in sodium , with a @xmath191 , @xmath192 would correspond to an applied field of @xmath193 gauss .",
    "the applied field for these simulations is uniform and applied along the impeller axis with @xmath194 gauss and @xmath195 . however , since the velocity fluctuations decrease with scale , the stuart number increases with scale , indicating the lorentz force may influence small - scale fluid motion .",
    "examples of such simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , where the kinetic energy and magnetic energy are shown for laminar and turbulent runs .    for the laminar flow , the induced currents and resulting magnetic field",
    "are purely due to the magnetic field interacting with the mean flow , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:11](a ) .",
    "two main effects are observed .",
    "first , induced toroidal currents compress lines of poloidal magnetic field near the axis of the device .",
    "the lines are pulled outward at the poles and inward at the equator .",
    "the net result is a reduction of the poloidal field strength at the equator in the outer region , and a large amplification at the axis ( the peak poloidal field is @xmath196 times the applied field ) .",
    "second , poloidal currents generate a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "these currents are generated by the well - known omega effect of dynamo theory whereby differential toroidal rotation of the fluid is able to stretch the field into the toroidal direction @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the peak toroidal field is greater than @xmath197 times the applied field .",
    "the transition to turbulence is still characterized by the same @xmath198 threshold described above , since the stuart number for the applied magnetic field is small . below this threshold ,",
    "the nonaxisymmetric part of the flows is negligible while above this threshold nonaxisymmetric fluctuations in both @xmath24 and @xmath199 can be as large as @xmath200 of the mean values .",
    "the geometry of the simulations ( axisymmetric drive terms aligned with the applied magnetic field ) makes it possible to separate mean , axisymmetric quantities and fluctuating quantities , @xmath201 where the brackets denote a time average over several resistive times . in practice ,",
    "@xmath202 and @xmath203 are axisymmetric for sufficiently long time averages . using these definitions ,",
    "the time - averaged magnetic fields can be computed for laminar and turbulent flows , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] .",
    "both laminar and turbulent flows demonstrate toroidal field production and expulsion of poloidal flux .",
    "laminar and turbulent results differ in several important ways , however , which are attributable to the currents being driven by mhd fluctuations .",
    "first , the toroidal field is greatly reduced in the turbulent run .",
    "the induced toroidal field is @xmath197 times the applied field strength in the laminar flow and is only twice the applied field in the turbulent case .",
    "second , the peak poloidal field is halved in the turbulent run , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:11](a ) .",
    "third , there is a net magnetic dipole moment associated with the induced field which is not present in the laminar case .",
    "these differences are partially the result of a difference between the mean flows in the two cases , but are mostly a due to a strong influence of the turbulence on the current generation .",
    "this can be interpreted in the context of a modification to the mean - field ohm s law , i.e.  turbulence - generated currents are modifying the large - scale , mean magnetic field .",
    "a turbulent emf is possible because of the flow fluctuations and the magnetic field generated by the passive advection of the applied magnetic field by the kolmogorov - like turbulence in the velocity field .",
    "fig.[fig:12 ] shows the wavenumber spectrum as estimated from the frequency spectrum of the fluctuations in both @xmath204 and @xmath205 at a fixed point in the simulation using the taylor hypothesis to map frequency fluctuations to wavenumber @xmath206 .",
    "it is clear that both the velocity field and magnetic field have an inertial range ( @xmath131 ) and a dissipation scale , although the dissipation scales are at different values of @xmath136 .",
    "the @xmath131 scaling of the velocity field ( the inertial range ) is expected from the kolmogorov theory of hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the dissipation scale for the fluid turbulence is expected to be at @xmath207 which is roughly the position of the viscous cutoff shown in fig.[fig:12 ] .",
    "the limited inertial range at low k , is primarily due to constraints on long - time averages of the data imposed by computational speed .",
    "the @xmath131 scaling of the magnetic field corresponds to the weak - field approximation in which the induced magnetic fluctuations are due to advection of the mean magnetic field by the mean flow @xcite for @xmath208 .",
    "the @xmath137 power law results from a balance between the mean magnetic field advected by turbulence and the resistive dissipation of magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the dissipation scales are evident from the knee in the wave number spectra of fig.[fig:12 ] .",
    "the spectrum is constructed from the power spectrum of the value of @xmath209 near the equator .",
    "consequently , the magnetic field gains structure at smaller scales as @xmath6 increases , down to scale sizes of @xmath210 cm at @xmath138 .",
    "the simultaneous fluctuating magnetic and velocity fields can potentially drive current in a mean - field sense .",
    "the motional emf can be written as @xmath211 where the mean - fields have been separated from the fluctuating parts .",
    "the time averages must be taken over times long compared to a turbulent decorrelation time and comparable to the resistive diffusion time .",
    "since the turbulent decorrelation time , @xmath212 , integrating the induction term over several resistive times yields @xmath213 an important question is whether the currents generated in the simulation are primarily due to the motional emf associated with the mean - flow and the mean magnetic field , @xmath214 , or if there are also currents driven by the turbulent emf @xmath142 .",
    "this can be investigated by examining the various terms in ohm s law @xmath215 it is clear that in steady - state there can be no inductive electric field in the toroidal direction since the poloidal flux is constant .",
    "axisymmetry precludes an electrostatic potential from driving current in the toroidal direction , and so the toroidal current can only be generated by the mean - flow and the turbulent emf .",
    "thus any currents driven in the toroidal direction contribute to the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "[ fig:13](c ) shows the currents driven by these fluctuations and their corresponding magnetic field ( a ) .",
    "the fluctuation - induced magnetic field is @xmath216 times larger than the applied field and comprises a third of the total field strength .",
    "it has been recently shown that an axisymmetric flow and axial magnetic field can not induce a dipole moment in any simply - connected bounded system @xcite .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the flow outside the conducting region is zero , while the streamlines of flow perpendicular to the magnetic flux are closed and bounded within the conducting region .",
    "only a turbulent emf can create the dipole moment . with a weak applied field in a turbulent fluid , averaging over several eddy turnover times and averaging along @xmath217",
    "eliminates the nonaxisymmetric component of the current , therefore the only nontrivial component of the dipole moment is @xmath218 the toroidal current generated by @xmath142 from eq .",
    "[ eq : time_var_ind ] , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:13](d ) and the associated dipole moment ( antiparallel to the external field ) is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:13](b ) .",
    "alternatively , the emf due to @xmath199 and @xmath24 gives rise to a hexapole magnetic field ( in fig .",
    "[ fig:13](a ) ) .",
    "the resulting poloidal field reduces the surface magnetic field by @xmath219 .",
    "the largest values of the turbulent toroidal current occur where the omega effect is also large .",
    "the emf which generates the toroidal current associated with the induced dipole moment may very well resemble the currents driven by the well - known @xmath165-effect .",
    "the omega effect generates a toroidal magnetic field which would in turn would support a current of the form @xmath220 .",
    "it is impossible to uniquely identify the current this way , however . a non - uniform @xmath166-effect ( change in local resistivity )",
    "could equally well explain the results . to do this",
    "would require separating the currents associated with the helical fluctuations from the non - helical fluctuations and this has not yet been done .",
    "a local analysis of the turbulent helicity content in fig .  [ fig:14](b ) shows that helical fluctuations exist that might be expected to drive a current through the @xmath165-effect .    to study ohm s law in the poloidal direction requires a full treatment of the poloidal electric field since an electrostatic potential is not ruled out by symmetry arguments . in mhd , the electrostatic potential is assumed to instantaneously adjust itself to ensure that @xmath221 .",
    "this can only be assured if the divergence of the motional emfs is balanced by a spatially varying electric field @xmath222 where @xmath183 and @xmath223 are electrostatic potentials due to the stationary emf , and turbulent emf respectively .",
    "thus , a poloidal current can be associated with the mean - flows and the turbulent emf respectively : @xmath224 when analyzing ohm s law in the poloidal direction , it is necessary to first compute these potentials , which has been done for the poloidal currents in fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] .",
    "the simulations indicate there is a strong poloidal current , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:13](d ) , associated with the fluctuations . the current acts to greatly reduce the toroidal magnetic field generated by a comparable laminar flow , thereby reducing the toroidal field in the core .",
    "this resembles the diamagnetic @xmath108-effect @xcite , due to gradients in the turbulence intensity .",
    "the @xmath165-effect is the diagonal part of a mean - field tensor : @xmath225 .",
    "the off - diagonal terms can also be written so that @xmath226",
    ". figure  [ fig:14](a ) shows the squared velocity fluctuations decrease away from the axis of symmetry with the polar radius , @xmath8 . for isotropic turbulence",
    ", the inhomogeneity in the fluctuations would give rise to a @xmath108-effect of the form @xmath227 with @xmath228 .",
    "the poloidal current due to turbulent diamagnetism would counteract the toroidal magnetic field caused by the omega effect .",
    "comparison between fig.[fig:13](a ) with fig.[fig:14](b ) shows that regions of steep gradients in the turbulent fluctuations correspond to regions of strong fluctuation induced poloidal current .",
    "the role of turbulence in generating current and moderating the growth of magnetic fields has been studied for the madison dynamo experiment using 3d numerical simulations .",
    "a simple forcing term has been used to model impellors in the experiment ; at sufficient forcing the flow becomes turbulent .",
    "two regimes were explored : one with an external applied magnetic field and flow subcritical to the dynamo instability and one with no external field and super - critical flow .",
    "the role of the turbulence on current generation and self - excitation is marked .",
    "the onset conditions for the dynamo instability are governed not only by @xmath6 but also by the magnetic prandtl number @xmath20 . at @xmath229 ,",
    "the transition and saturation agree with laminar predictions and are considered laminar dynamos . at lower @xmath20 , @xmath230 increases ,",
    "consistent with a reduction in conductivity due to turbulent fluctuations .",
    "however , at higher @xmath6 the character of the dynamo changes ; its symmetry suggests that turbulence driven currents are important in the self - excitation process .",
    "the @xmath20 values in the simulations are still orders of magnitude larger than in liquid - metal experiments ( and for geo and solar dynamos ) due to memory and speed limitations of computers , and so experiment support is critical for verifying these results .    to quantify currents driven by fluctuations in the experiment , simulations of subcritical flows have been performed , and the currents driven by the turbulent fluctuations have been observed directly .",
    "the main effect of the turbulence on an externally - applied magnetic field is the reduction of field strength compared with those computed for laminar flows .",

    "both effects are reduced in turbulent flows .",
