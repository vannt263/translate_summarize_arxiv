    "a similar or better accuracy may also be reached at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",

    "iii . due to the mass singular logarithms associated with final state photon bremsstrahlung in the limit where the photon is emitted collinear with one of the charged leptons , the di - lepton invariant mass distribution is strongly affected by qed corrections , in particular in the vicinity of the @xmath4 boson resonance . as a result ,",
    "the value extracted for @xmath15 from data is shifted to a lower value .",
    "the amount of the shift depends on the lepton mass , and the detector resolution  @xcite .",

    "the second procedure completely eliminates the mass singular logarithms . with the first method ,",
    "residual effects of these terms remain when both particles are almost collinear , but hit different calorimeter cells . in practice ,",
    "the numerical difference between the two procedures is moderate ; in both cases the significance of the qed corrections is considerably reduced . in contrast",
    ", photons which are almost collinear with muons are rejected if they are too energetic  @xcite which results in residual logarithmic corrections to observable quantities in @xmath27 production .",
    "transverse momentum and rapidity cuts are found to affect the lepton pair invariant mass distribution and forward backward asymmetry in a similar way at the born level and at @xmath28 .",
    "recently , it has been suggested  @xcite , that an ultra precise measurement of @xmath5 may be possible at the lhc ( @xmath29 collisions at @xmath30  tev  @xcite ) in the muon channel , using the forward backward asymmetry in the @xmath4 peak region . at the lhc ,",
    "the forward backward asymmetry is significantly reduced compared to the tevatron because of the larger sea  sea quark parton flux .",
    "we find that the sensitivity of @xmath3 to the effective weak mixing angle strongly depends on the rapidity range over which the leptons can be detected .",
    "the forward backward asymmetry at the lhc , including @xmath0 qed and @xmath26 qcd corrections , is studied in detail in sec .",

    "the diagrams contributing to the @xmath20 qed corrections can be separated into gauge invariant subsets corresponding to initial and final state corrections .",

    "this is done by introducing theoretical soft and collinear cutoff parameters , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . using dimensional regularization  @xcite ,",
    "the soft and collinear singularities are exposed as poles in @xmath36 ( the number of space - time dimensions is @xmath37 with @xmath36 a small number ) . in the soft and collinear regions the cross section is proportional to the born cross section .",
    "the soft region is defined by requiring that the photon energy in the @xmath38 center of mass frame , @xmath39 , is @xmath40 ( @xmath41 denotes the squared parton center of mass energy ) .",

    "the soft singularities originating from final state photon radiation cancel against the corresponding singularities from the interference of born and final state virtual corrections .",
    "similarly , the soft singularities associated with initial state photon emission and interference effects between initial and final state radiation cancel against the corresponding singularities originating from initial state vertex corrections , and the @xmath44 and @xmath45 box diagrams , respectively .",
    "the remainder is then evaluated via monte carlo integration as part of the @xmath46 contribution . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the real photon emission diagrams are calculated in four dimensions  @xcite using standard three body phase space monte carlo integration techniques .    the collinear singularity associated with photon radiation from the final state lepton line",
    "is regulated by the finite lepton mass .",
    "the collinear singularities originating from initial state photon bremsstrahlung are universal to all orders of perturbation theory and can be cancelled by universal collinear counterterms generated by renormalizing the parton distribution functions  @xcite , in complete analogy to gluon emission in qcd  @xcite .",

    "the missing qed corrections to the pdf introduce an uncertainty which , however , probably is much smaller than the present uncertainties on the parton distribution functions .",

    "the forward backward asymmetry in the born approximation is small at low di - lepton masses , because of the dominance of photon exchange and the vectorlike coupling of the photon to leptons . for di - lepton masses below 40  gev , the @xmath0 initial  final state interference correction terms are almost completely antisymmetric in @xmath121 and comprise the most important component of the qed corrections to @xmath3 .",
    "in this region , the @xmath0 qed corrections to @xmath3 are therefore large . initial ",
    "final state interference terms do not contain any mass singular contributions . as a result ,",
    "the forward backward asymmetries for electron and muon final states are similar for @xmath105  gev .",
    "details of the asymmetry in the low di - lepton mass region are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] . effects from purely weak corrections are not included in our calculation .",
    "they could have a non - negligible effect on the forward backward asymmetry at low di - lepton masses , similar to the situation encountered in @xmath129  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the lepton pair invariant mass distribution , qed corrections to @xmath3 are small for @xmath130  gev .",
    "they reduce the forward backward asymmetry by about 1% in this region .",
    "initial and final state corrections to @xmath3 are of similar size for lepton pair invariant masses above the @xmath4 peak .",
    "recently , the cdf collaboration has presented a first measurement of the integrated forward backward asymmetry in @xmath131 at the tevatron for @xmath132  gev , together with a more refined measurement in the @xmath4 peak region ( @xmath133  gev )  @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : one ] , we list the experimental values , together with the theoretical prediction with and without @xmath0 qed corrections .",
    "qed corrections are seen to increase the asymmetry by about 8% in the peak region . in the muon channel ,",
    "the increase in @xmath3 for @xmath134  gev due to radiative corrections is approximately 4% .    in the @xmath4 peak region",
    ", @xmath3 provides a tool to measure @xmath5  @xcite . for @xmath75  gev and @xmath24  tev , the forward backward asymmetry can to a very good approximation be parameterized by  @xcite @xmath135 both in the born approximation and including @xmath0 qed corrections . for the parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 we find in the born approximation @xmath138 for @xmath139 as well as @xmath27 final states , and @xmath140 with @xmath141 for @xmath142 , and @xmath143 for @xmath144 .",
    "the change of the effective weak mixing angle due to qed radiative corrections is a factor  3 to  4 larger than the current experimental uncertainty , @xmath145  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the approximation used to estimate the electroweak corrections to @xmath3 resulted in a significant dependence of the correction to @xmath5 on the infrared cutoff used in the calculation .",
    "in contrast , as explained in detail in sec .",
    "ii , our results are cutoff independent .",
    "this will make it possible to substantially reduce the theoretical uncertainty of the weak mixing angle extracted from future measurements of @xmath3 at the tevatron .",

    "as explained below , the finite resolution of detectors prevents fully exclusive measurements .",
    "detector effects , which we have completely ignored so far , therefore may significantly modify the effect of qed radiative corrections . to simulate detector acceptance ,",
