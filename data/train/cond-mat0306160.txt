    "<S> high - resolution x - ray scattering , in the presence of an applied current , has been used for studying the stability of the charge ordered phase of manganese oxides upon current biasing . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the charge ordered structure is unchanged when a current is flowing in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> such a result indicates that the non - linear conduction observed in charge ordered manganites can not be ascribed to a current - induced destabilisation of charge ordering .    </S>",
    "<S> rare earth manganites with general chemical formula @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 and @xmath2 being trivalent rare - earth and divalent ions , respectively ) show a wide variety of electronic and magnetic properties such as colossal magnetoresistance and charge ( co ) or orbital ordering ( oo).@xcite the physics of the detabilization of the co by different types of perturbation has recently been under very active investigation.@xcite for instance , it is now well established that the co is stabilized by lattice distortions ; thus , a perturbation of this distortion by changing the average - a - site cationic radius can weaken the co.@xcite besides , it has been reported that irradiation by x - rays@xcite or light and application of pressure@xcite can also induce a melting of the co , leading to a transition from a charge - localized state ( cl ) to a charge - delocalized state ( cd ) .  </S>",
    "<S> application of an electric field is also known to induce a cl - cd transformation ; this latter feature is always associated with a strong non - linearity of the tension - current characteristics ( v - i).@xcite    up to now , the optical and irradiation induced transition are argued to be the result of classical percolation transport in a non - homogeneous medium ; however , it is not clear whether the underlying mechanism is the same for all perturbations , in particular for the electric field induced transition . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> , this feature is interpreted in terms of current induced destabilization of the co - cl state leading to the creation of low resistivity conducting path along the current flow.@xcite recent experimental results do not agree with such a current - induced co melting scenario.@xcite  indeed , electrical measurements , performed on the non - charge ordered compounds pr@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath5 , also exhibit a current induced cl - cd transition associated with a strong non linearity of the v - i characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , the destruction of the co can not be invoked , suggesting that the mechanism is more complex than the one initially proposed .    in this paper , we present synchrotron x - ray diffraction data for the charge - ordered manganites pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath5 and nd@xmath8ca@xmath9mno@xmath5 polycrystalline samples . </S>",
    "<S> details for synthesis of the sample are reported elsewhere.@xcite measurements have been performed as a function of temperature _ and current _ on the diffractometer id31 at esrf ( grenoble , france ) using an incident wavelength of 0.413   ( e=30 kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the typical sizes of the samples allow a homogeneous sample cooling together with suitable beam transmission . </S>",
    "<S> two contacts of in were soldered onto the section ( 1x2 mm@xmath10 ) of the sample , leaving an uncovered section l= 3 mm . </S>",
    "<S> v - i data were taken with current biasing ( keithley 236 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our x - rays diffraction patterns , analyzed with the rietveld method , lead to an orthorhombic cell with @xmath11 @xmath12 , @xmath13 in a @xmath14 space group at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> previous neutron - diffraction measurements@xcite showed that the co structure is characterized by a doubling of the a - axis and the appearance of additional peaks of the type ( h/2 k l ) . </S>",
    "<S> a careful search was made for such superlattice peaks associated with charge ordering of @xmath15and @xmath16 in pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath5 and nd@xmath8ca@xmath17mno@xmath5 below @xmath18 = 235k and 200k , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows narrow regions covering the strongest of these peaks for nd@xmath8ca@xmath17mno@xmath5 at a temperature below @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , solid line ) together with the results of similar scans for t=295k @xmath18 ( symbols ) . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> no superlattice peaks can be observed whereas , for t= 100 k the superlattice peaks are well defined . </S>",
    "<S> high resolution x - ray scattering measurements in the presence of an applied direct current would permit to determine unambiguously whether the current induced cl - cd transition associated with the non - linear v - i characteristics can be linked to a co destruction . </S>",
    "<S> transport properties were simultaneously measured in situ during the experiments . a strong non - linearity i. e a deviation from the ohm s law , </S>",
    "<S> is observed when the bias current attains a threshold value for pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath5 and nd@xmath8ca@xmath17mno@xmath5 powder samples .  </S>",
    "<S> this non - linearity is even more obvious when @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 curves are plotted ( see figure 2a and 2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> as expected the resistance is independent of the bias current in the ohmic regime and is strongly decreased for a critical value of the current.@xcite one can observe that the current value where the non - linearity sets in and the width of the transition are strongly temperature dependent ( both increase as the temperature increases ) . because of the rounding of the variation of @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 , it is very difficult to define a value for a critical current . </S>",
    "<S> however , a rough estimate gives @xmath23 = 4 ma and 1 ma for pr@xmath24ca@xmath7mno@xmath5 and nd@xmath8ca@xmath17mno@xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters in these compounds is rather complex . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that their temperature behavior is characterized by the presence of changes of slopes corresponding to the characteristic structural and magnetic ordering temperatures.@xcite for t@xmath18 , a comparison of the current _ and _ temperature dependence of the cell volume determined from the synchrotron x - ray diffraction data allows us to discard definitely any joule heating effect . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , no evolution of the cell volume is observed as a function of the applied current ( imax = 10 ma , well above the value of the current for which the non - linearity sets in ) whereas , in the range of temperature above 100k , a steep increase of the cell volume is observed with zero biased current ( see figure 3 for nd@xmath8ca@xmath17mno@xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a result is found for both composition pr@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath5 and nd@xmath8ca@xmath17mno@xmath25    figure 4a and 4b show for both compounds the integrated intensity of the superlattice peaks corresponding to the co as a function of the applied current . in figure 5 , </S>",
    "<S> a characteristic portion of the x - ray diffraction patterns is shown at 100k with i = 0 , 1 and 5 ma .  </S>",
    "<S> the shapes and the intensities of the superlattice peaks are not modified whatever the value of the applied current lying in the ohmic or non - ohmic region </S>",
    "<S> . such a result does not give a direct interpretation of the process involved in the non - linear conduction but , at least , allows us to discard any co destabilization as an origin for this feature . </S>",
    "<S> other interpretations , based on a preserved superstructure when a current is flowing , must now be proposed . in charge </S>",
    "<S> ordered compounds , observation of non - linear conduction setting in along with a large broad band noise suggests that the charge ordered state gets depinned at the onset of the non - linear regime.@xcite besides , the possibility of a charge density wave ( cdw ) condensate in this charge ordered regime of the manganese oxides is now well established.@xcite this might be a track to explain the occurrence of the non - linear conduction in such systems . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we have proposed an interpretation in terms of collective excitation of cdws.@xcite in such a framework , the non - linear conduction arises from the motion of the cdw domains which carries a net electrical current .    e. o. wollan and w. c. koehler , phys . rev . * </S>",
