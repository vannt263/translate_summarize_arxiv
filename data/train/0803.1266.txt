    "the discoveries of quasicrystals @xcite , aperiodic tilings @xcite , and complex metallic alloys @xcite have greatly increased our awareness that there is a substantial difference between the notions of periodicity and long - range order .",
    "although pinning an exact definition to the concept of long - range order is not yet possible ( nor perhaps desirable at this intermediate stage , compare the discussion in @xcite ) , there is still some general agreement that the appearance of a substantial point - like component in the diffraction of a structure is a strong , though not a necessary , indicator of the phenomenon .",
    "mathematically , the diffraction  say of a point set @xmath0 in @xmath1  is the measure @xmath2 on @xmath1 which is the fourier transform of the volume averaged autocorrelation @xmath3 of @xmath0 ( or , more precisely , of its dirac comb @xmath4 ) . over the past 20 years or so",
    ", considerable effort has been put into understanding the mathematics of diffraction , especially conditions under which @xmath0 is pure point diffractive , in the sense that @xmath2 is a pure point measure , compare @xcite . at this point in time",
    ", we have a good collection of models for producing pure point diffraction , particularly the cut and project sets ( or model sets ) . under certain types of discreteness conditions",
    ", one can even go as far as to say that these types of sets essentially characterise the pure point diffractive point sets @xcite .",
    "but real life structures are not perfectly pure point diffractive , and in order to gain further insight into the possible structures of materials , and more generally into the whole concept of long - range order , it is necessary to widen the scope of this study to include mixed diffraction spectra . in particular",
    ", this means that one has to consider structures whose diffraction measures contain at least some continuous part . note that distinct structures may have the same diffraction , which makes the corresponding inverse problem difficult ( and generally unsolvable without further information )",
    "in fact , this gets worse outside the realm of pure point spectra , and any improvement requires a better understanding of the diffraction of structures with some form of randomness",
    ".    however , when it comes to mixed spectra , relatively little is known , although there are many particular examples @xcite .",
    "even deterministic sets can have mixed diffraction spectra , and once any randomness is introduced , this is the norm . determining the exact nature of the diffraction is usually difficult and often simply not known .",
    "no doubt , the possibilities , both in nature and in mathematics , for structures with long - range order are well beyond what we have presently imagined .",
    "this is also made apparent by systems such as the pinwheel tiling , compare @xcite and references therein , which looks like an amorphous structure in diffraction , in spite of being completely regular . in particular , except for the trivial bragg peak at @xmath5 , there is no pure point part in the diffraction .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to show how the techniques from the theory of stochastic point processes may be used when systems with long - range order are subjected to modifications in the form of stochastic perturbations . in as much as",
    "our primary goal is the study of long - range order , the types of point processes of most interest to us are quite different from those usually studied in stochastic geometry . for instance ,",
    "as mentioned above , a phenomenon of fundamental importance in long - range order is the appearance of bragg peaks in diffraction , which refers to a non - trivial pure point part of the diffraction measure . for ergodic point processes",
    ", this implies the existence of non - trivial ( dynamical ) eigenvalues and thus excludes weak mixing @xcite .",
    "hence , we are particularly interested in systems that lie between ergodic and weak mixing . furthermore , a number of basic and influential mathematical models of long - range order are deterministic .",
    "even so , the theory of point processes is relevant @xcite and yields considerable insight .    to elaborate on this a little ,",
    "consider the classic penrose tilings @xcite .",
    "fix a set of two generating penrose prototiles ( with matching rule markers ) and a set of overall orientations for them ( so each prototile comes in @xmath6 distinct orientations ) .",
    "the resulting set of admissible tilings of the plane , even if one vertex of the first tile laid down is fixed , is uncountable . replacing each of these tilings by its corresponding vertex point set and allowing all ( global ) translations ,",
    "collectively we obtain the set @xmath7 of all penrose point sets in the given orientation .",
    "the set @xmath7 , which is also called the _ hull _",
    ", has a natural topology in which it is compact , and it carries a unique ( and hence ergodic ) stationary borel probability measure @xmath8 .",
    "the pair @xmath9 can now be viewed both as a dynamical system and as a stationary ergodic point process , which permits the powerful tools from both subjects to be applied .",
    "in particular , the diffraction and the dynamical spectrum are linked by the dynamics @xcite , while the diffraction is also the fourier transform of the first moment measure of the palm measure of the point process @xcite .",
    "this type of scenario , which applies to many models of long - range order , deterministic or otherwise , has not yet been investigated in much detail .",
    "it would seem desirable then , as a first step , to establish methods , capable of being explicitly computable , that would cover typical and much - studied situations and also suggest ways in which to generalise what is known , and even move into yet unexplored territory .    as already implicitly mentioned , mathematical diffraction theory is based on the approach set out by hof in @xcite , namely via autocorrelations and their measures .",
    "our paper is primarily guided by examples , set in as great a generality as we can manage without becoming too technical .",
    "the examples are selected under the consistent theme that they are computable , while they unify and extend existing results in a systematic way .",
    "briefly , the types of situations that we consider are these :    * renewal processes on the real line ( sec .",

    "5.5 , with theorem  [ cbbm ] ) .",
    "while ( i ) and ( ii ) have a bit of a review character , ( iii ) and ( iv ) are new in this context .",
    "the results for ( i ) and ( ii ) are included with details and several examples because they have immediate applications to practical diffraction analysis , while the results are scattered over the literature or only covered implicitly .",
    "since the transfer of methods and results from stochastic geometry to mathematical diffraction theory requires a somewhat unusual view on measures and their fourier transforms , we begin with a brief recapitulation of concepts needed here . for the sake of completeness and readability ( as well as lack of reference ) , some details on the ergodic theorem that we need for ( iii ) are added as an appendix .",
    "throughout the paper , we need various standard notions and results from fourier analysis and measure theory , which we summarise here , introducing our notation at the same time .",
    "first , let @xmath8 be a finite , regular ( and possibly complex ) borel measure on @xmath11 ; compare @xcite for background .",
    "its fourier ( or fourier - stieltjes ) transform is a uniformly continuous function on @xmath11 , defined by @xmath12 see @xcite for details .",
    "this definition includes the fourier transform of arbitrary schwartz functions or integrable functions ( the corresponding spaces being denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) by viewing them as radon - nikodym densities for lebesgue measure @xmath15 , hence as finite measures . in this version of the fourier",
    "transform , with the factor @xmath16 included in the exponent , there is no need for prefactors ( though the factor @xmath16 reappears up front under differentiation ) .",
    "in particular , one has the usual convolution theorem in the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 for continuous functions @xmath19 ( note that we identify finite , complex , regular borel measures on @xmath11 with continuous linear functionals on @xmath20 , in line with the riesz - markov representation theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm .  6.19 ) ) .",
    "below , we need to go beyond the situation of finite measures . for the introduction of unbounded measures , the linear functional point of view",
    "is advantageous . here , an _ unbounded measure _",
    "is thus understood as a linear functional on the space @xmath21 of continuous functions with compact support such that , for any compact set @xmath22 , there is a constant @xmath23 with @xmath24 for all continuous @xmath25 with support in @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding space @xmath27 is thus equipped with the vague topology , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "as before , we can identify these measures with the locally finite , complex , regular borel measures on @xmath28 , by an appropriate version of the riesz - markov representation theorem ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "69.1 ) for a formulation for positive measures and use the polar representation ( * ? ? ?",
    "13.16.3 ) for an extension to complex measures .",
    "the absolute value @xmath29 of @xmath8 , also known as the _ total variation _ measure of @xmath8 , is the smallest positive measure such that @xmath30 holds for all @xmath31 .",
    "when an unbounded measure @xmath8 also defines a tempered distribution , via @xmath32 for @xmath33 , it is called a _ tempered measure_. its fourier transform ( as a distribution ) is then defined via @xmath34 as usual @xcite , so that @xmath35 is a tempered distribution .",
    "below , we only consider situations where @xmath35 is also a measure , hence a linear functional on @xmath36 . recall that a ( complex ) measure @xmath8 is called _ translation bounded _ when @xmath37 holds for arbitrary compact sets @xmath38 .",
    "translation boundedness is a sufficient ( though not a necessary ) criterion for a measure to be tempered , see @xcite for details . in this setting",
    ", we call a measure _ transformable _ when it is tempered and when its fourier transform ( as a distribution ) is again a measure",
    ". transformability of a measure is a difficult question in general ; see @xcite and references therein for details .",
    "a measure @xmath39 is called _ positive definite _ , when @xmath40 holds for every function @xmath41 ; here , @xmath42 is the function defined by @xmath43 .",
    "positive definite measures have various nice properties , some of which can be summarised as follows ; see ( * ? ? ?",

    "if @xmath8 is positive and positive definite , it is translation bounded ; * if @xmath8 is positive definite , it is fourier transformable , and @xmath35 is a positive , translation bounded measure ; * a transformable measure @xmath8 is positive definite if and only if @xmath35 is a positive measure ;    moreover , the mapping @xmath44 defines a bijection between the positive definite and the transformable positive measures on @xmath28 .",
    "let us consider some examples that will reappear later . if @xmath45 is a _ lattice _",
    "( meaning a discrete subgroup of @xmath11 with compact factor group @xmath46 ) , we write @xmath47 for the corresponding dirac comb , with @xmath48 the normalised point measure at @xmath49 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath50 is a tempered measure , whose fourier transform is again a tempered measure .",
    "the latter is explicitly given by the poisson summation formula ( psf ) in its version for lattice dirac combs ( * ? ? ?",

    "the density of @xmath53 is well - defined and given by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the oriented volume of a ( measurable ) fundamental domain of @xmath53 .",
    "it can most easily be calculated as the determinant of a lattice basis .",
    "observing @xmath56 , a more symmetric version of the psf reads @xmath57 in particular , one has @xmath58 , so that the lattice dirac comb of @xmath59 is self - dual in this sense .",
    "radially symmetric psf . as an aside of independent interest ,",
    "let us recall the following related formula for a radially symmetric situation in @xmath11 , which emerges from a simplified model of powder diffraction @xcite .",
    "let @xmath53 and @xmath60 be as before , and let @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote the numbers of points of @xmath53 and @xmath60 on centred spheres @xmath63 of radius @xmath64 .",
    "the ( non - zero ) numbers @xmath61 are also called the _ shelling numbers _ of the lattice @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath65 denotes the uniform probability measure on @xmath63 , with @xmath66 , one has the following radial analogue of the psf in , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and analogously for @xmath69 , see @xcite for a proof and further details .",
    "the formula can also be brought to a more symmetric form , as in eq .  .",
    "@xmath70    another simple , but important , pair of mutual fourier transforms follows from the relations @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with @xmath15 being lebesgue measure , so that we have @xmath73 we shall meet this self - dual pair of measures below in examples  [ poisson - on - the - line ] and [ ex - poisson ] , in connection with the poisson process .",
    "a little less obvious is the following result .    [ lemma-1 ]",

    "the function @xmath75 is locally integrable and , when seen as a radon - nikodym density for @xmath15 , defines an absolutely continuous and translation bounded measure on @xmath11 .",
    "this measure satisfies the identity @xmath76 where the transformed measure is again translation bounded and absolutely continuous .",
    "moreover , both measures are positive and positive definite .    local integrability of both measures on @xmath11 rests upon that of their densities around @xmath5 , which follows from rewriting the volume element in polar coordinates , @xmath77 , with @xmath78 the standard surface element of the unit sphere in @xmath11 .",
    "absolute continuity and translation boundedness are then clear , while the fourier identity follows from a calculation with the heat kernel , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "as both measures are clearly positive , they are also positive definite by the bochner - schwartz theorem ( * ? ? ?",

    "incidentally , dividing the identity in lemma  [ lemma-1 ] by @xmath79 shows that @xmath80 in the vague topology , which follows from the corresponding fourier transforms of the left hand side converging vaguely to @xmath15 .",
    "let us now briefly review the concept of the diffraction measure of a complex measure @xmath81 as the fourier transform of the autocorrelation @xmath3 of @xmath81 .",
    "it motivation comes from the physics of diffraction @xcite , while its precise mathematical formulation was pioneered by hof @xcite .",
    "in general , a complex measure @xmath81 need not be transformable , and may thus not be a good object for harmonic analysis . in view of lemma  [ pos - def - props ] , it seems appealing to first attach a positive definite measure to @xmath81 , which is possible as follows .",
    "if @xmath82 denotes the restriction of @xmath81 to the open ball @xmath83 of radius @xmath64 around @xmath5 , the natural _ autocorrelation measure _ @xmath84 is defined as @xmath85 provided the limit exists . here",

    "if @xmath81 is translation bounded , the one - parameter family of finite measures @xmath89 is uniformly translation bounded and hence precompact in the vague topology by ( * ? ? ?",
    "one can thus always select converging subsequences to define _ an _ autocorrelation ( which then depends on the sequence of averaging sets ) . as long as balls are used , one speaks of _ natural _ autocorrelations .",
    "more generally , one may work with any _ averaging sequence _",

    "in general , an interesting initial question concerns the spectral type of @xmath2 , which follows from the spectral decomposition @xmath110 of @xmath2 into its pure point , singular continuous and absolutely continuous parts relative to @xmath15 , the latter being the haar measure on @xmath28 with @xmath111^{d } \\bigr ) = 1 $ ] .",
