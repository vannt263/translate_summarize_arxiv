    "the formation of protein secondary structure has attracted great interest in the past 50 years , due to their remarkably regular spatial arrangement@xcite .",
    "there are usually two distinct interactions involved : namely short - range interaction between atoms and groups which are near neighbors in sequence along the chain ; and long - range interactions involving pairs of units which are remote in sequence but near in space@xcite .",
    "how these interactions affect the formation of secondary structure , especially @xmath1-sheet , is essential in the study of protein folding . on the other hand , a protein sequence can display structure ambivalence and interconverts between @xmath0-helix and @xmath1-sheet conformations@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon may concern about many well - known diseases , such as alzheimer s , mad cow and parkinson s disease .",
    "but the underlying mechanism is still not very clear . in this paper , we try to establish a unified statistical model of @xmath0-helix/@xmath1-sheet / random - coil transition in proteins , which includes both short - range and long - range interactions",
    ". it will be an extension of zimm - bragg s ( z - b ) model to include beta structures as well@xcite , and is totally different from former tension - induced @xmath0/@xmath1 transition theory@xcite , which has only mentioned short - range interactions .",
    "@xmath0-helix and @xmath1-sheet are most important secondary structure elements in protein .",
    "an @xmath0-helix is found when a stretch of consecutive residues all have torsion angle pair @xmath2 approximately @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the allowed region in the bottom left quadrant of the ramachandran plot . in @xmath0-helix , the co group of residue @xmath5",
    "is bonded to the nh group of residue @xmath6 .",
    "thus , it contains only short - range interactions .",
    "the @xmath1-sheet , however , is built up of several segments of the polypeptide chain . and",
    "long - range interactions are involved .",
    "these segments , @xmath1-strands , are usually of @xmath7 residues long , with @xmath8 angles in the broad structurally allowed region in the upper left quadrant of the ramachandran plot .",
    "the @xmath1-strands are aligned adjacent to each other , such that hydrogen bonds can form between co groups of one strand and nh group of an adjacent strand , and vice versa .    in the presence of long - range interactions ,",
    "it is not sufficient to distinguish states of a protein by only identifying the states of each amino acid .",
    "various bonding patterns of @xmath1-strands can result in different states .",
    "therefore , the different ways of arranging @xmath1-strands into @xmath1-sheets have to be considered . in this paper , we will establish a model , in which two sets of codes are introduced to represent respectively the state of each residue and connecting pattern of the @xmath1-strands .",
    "accordingly , we are able to write down the partition function , through which the transition between alpha , beta and random coil structures of a protein is discussed in detail .",
    "when no @xmath0-helix is presented , our model shows that a coil - to - sheet transition occurs as the local constraint factor is increased . and the sharpness of transition is determined by the long - range bonding parameter and the initiation factor .",
    "the smaller these two parameters are , the sharper the transition will be .",
    "this result has similar feature as that in coil - to - helix transition , which has been studied extensively by z - b model . with the increment of the local constraint factor ,",
    "the normalized number of @xmath1-strands increases firstly , and then decreases after passing the transition point , due to the competition between short - range and long - range interactions .",
    "helix / sheet transition is of great interest in this paper . in the presence of long - range interactions ,",
    "the entropy contribution to partition function becomes more important .",
    "this is due to the ways of connecting @xmath1-strands into @xmath1-sheets can be various , even when the state of each residue is known .",
    "unlike enthalpy controlled helix / coil transition in z - b model , helix / sheet transition is driven by entropy .",
    "a transition from @xmath0-helix to @xmath1-sheet occurs , when either the local constraint factor of beta residues or the long - range bonding parameter of @xmath1-stands is increased .",
    "the sharpness of transition depends on the competition between short - range and long - range interactions .",
    "moreover , the compromise between short - range and long - range interactions is able to give rise to mixed @xmath9 structure .",
    "the length and temperature dependence of the transition are also studied .",
    "statistical study of protein structures reported in protein data bank ( pdb ) shows that the fractions of alpha and beta residues are nearly unchanged when the chain is sufficiently long(@xmath10 ) . comparing our theoretical result with the data , we are able to identify the values of parameters in our model .",
    "interestingly , the parameter values are close to the transition point .",
    "this indicates that protein sequences in living cells are well selected by evolution , to compromise the required properties such as stability , flexibility and diversity .",
    "the temperature dependence is studied based on above parameter values .",
    "our results show that at low temperature , @xmath0-helix is dominated because of strong local interactions ; while at high temperature , beta structure is more favored due to larger entropy contribution",
    ".    this paper will begin with an extension of z - b model in section [ sec:2 ] , where connection properties of @xmath1-strands are introduced to obtain a complete description for the state of a protein .",
    "the partition function is obtained in section [ sec:3 ] , by simple assumptions on the states of amino acid residues and @xmath1-strands . in section [ sec:4 ] , we discuss the transition from random coil and @xmath0-helix to @xmath1-sheet under different conditions . at last",
    ", a brief conclusion is given in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "this section presents a model for the polypeptide chain that is intended to extend z - b model to include beta structures .",
    "specifically , it establishes a second order coding for the connection of @xmath1-strands in @xmath1-sheets . the partition function is then formulated as contributions from all @xmath0 , all @xmath1 and @xmath9 mixed structures . to describe the model in detail",
    ", we firstly have to make a complete description of the conformation of a chain , which will be finished in two steps .",
    "the first step is to define the state of each amino acid residue , in other words , which one is @xmath0-helical and which one is in @xmath1-strand .",
    "definition of @xmath0-helical residue is straightforward , i.e. , those residues whose nh group is bonded to the co group of the fourth preceding residue . here we have assumed that bonding of a residue , if it occurs in @xmath0-helix , is always to the fourth preceding residue , and disregard other helical structures such as @xmath11-helix or @xmath12-helix@xcite . to determine whether a residue is in @xmath1-strand is sticky and depends on the state of its neighboring residues .",
    "we assume that a residue is regarded as in @xmath1-strand if the angle pair @xmath13 of itself or both of its neighboring residues take values in the upper left quadrant of ramachandran plot .",
    "now , a chain of @xmath5 residue can be described by a sequence of @xmath5 symbols , each of which can have one of three values : digit @xmath14 represents a random coil residue , @xmath15 for an @xmath0-helical residue , and @xmath16 for a residue in @xmath1-strand .",
    "an example is shown by the 1st code in fig .",
    "[ fig : mod ] .    knowing the state of each residue is not sufficient .",
    "we need a 2nd code to describe how @xmath1-strands are connected into @xmath1-sheets .",
    "we assign a symbol @xmath17 for the @xmath18th strand in the @xmath19th @xmath1-sheet(2nd code in fig .",
    "[ fig : mod ] ) . here , the number @xmath18 is assigned not according to the sequence along the chain , but the spatial connection position in the @xmath1-sheet .",
    "now , the state of a chain can completely be described by these two sequences of codes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mod ] .",
    "we will see later that this second step makes major differences between @xmath1-sheet and @xmath0-helix , and gives rise to the helix / sheet transition .    [",

    "the quantity @xmath20 for every @xmath15 that follows a @xmath15 ( helical residue ) .",

    "4 .   the quantity @xmath23 for every @xmath16 ( residue in a @xmath1-strand ) . 5 .   the quantity @xmath24 for every @xmath17 with @xmath25 ( @xmath1-strand ) . 6 .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 for every @xmath27 ( initiation of a @xmath1-sheet ) . 7 .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 for one of the following cases : 1 .",
    "every @xmath15 that follows @xmath16 or a number of @xmath14 less than @xmath22 ; 2 .",
    "every @xmath16 that follows @xmath15 or a number of @xmath14 less than @xmath22 ; 3 .",
    "every single @xmath16 between two @xmath14 .",
    "the effect of assumption ( 7 ) is that the secondary structures are separated from each other by at least @xmath22 coil residues ; and each @xmath1-strand contains at least @xmath16 residues .",
    "the number @xmath22 is varied from case to case . for example , two helices are separated by at least @xmath28 residues , while two @xmath1-strands can be separated by only two residues ( @xmath1-turn ) . in this paper , we will take a uniform value , say @xmath29 , for simplicity .",
    "we will see later that the value of @xmath22 has little effect on the transition , especially for long chains .",
    "the meaning of the statistical weights are as follows .",
    "the first three weights are the same as those in z - b model@xcite .",
    "the factor unity is arbitrarily assigned to coil residues , since only the relative ratio is effective . the factor",
    "@xmath20 measures the contribution of a helical residue , relative to a coil residue , to the partition function .",
    "it contains a decrease due to restriction of torsion angle and an enhancement because of the hydrogen bonding .",
    "the factor @xmath30 represents the decrease of weight @xmath20 for the first unit in a helix , since the formation of first hydrogen bond causes restriction of the freedom of residues between the bonded ones .",
    "the next three weights are new and for beta structures .",
    "the factor @xmath23 measures the contribution of a residue in @xmath1-strand , relative to a coil residue , to the partition function .",
    "it contains an slight increase due to the lower energy compared to coil residues@xcite .",
    "note the torsion angle of beta residues can take values from a quite broad region from the upper left quadrant of the ramachandran plot , thus the restriction in freedom is not serious .",
    "the factor @xmath24 represents long - range interactions between a pair of bonded @xmath1-strands .",
    "this includes a decrease due to restriction of freedom of residues between the two bonded @xmath1-strands , and an enhancement due to the hydrogen bonding .",
    "nevertheless , since two @xmath1-strands can be separated by long distance along the chain , the effect of decreasing is dominant .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath24 is usually small .",
    "similar to the case of helix , an initiation factor @xmath31 is introduced to measure the decrease of weight @xmath24 for the first pair of @xmath1-strands in a @xmath1-sheet . in summary , for the five weights in the model , the factors @xmath20 and @xmath23 are usually sightly larger than unity , while @xmath30 , @xmath24 and @xmath31 are all less than unity .    in the above discussion , we assume that the bonding energy(factor @xmath24 ) of each pair of @xmath1-strands are the same , and independent of the number of both residues and hydrogen bonds between the bonded @xmath1-strands . it is a highly simplified representation of the problem and",
    "enables us to write down the partition function .",
    "one may introduce a set of factors @xmath32 , which depends on those two values , to make the model more realistic .",
    "but since bonding patterns of @xmath1-sheet varies greatly , our present knowledge is too incomplete to justify a more refined model .",
    "a formal representation of partition function @xmath33 for a chain of @xmath5 residues can be obtained from above model by direct enumerating of the number of different ways of arranging digits @xmath34 and the state of strands @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath35 be the state of a chain , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are respectively the number of helical residues , beta residues , @xmath0-helices , @xmath1-strands and @xmath1-sheets .",

    ". then we insert @xmath48 coil residues between @xmath0-helices and @xmath1-strands .",
    "finally , we rearrange the order of @xmath0-helices and @xmath1-strands .",
    "the meaning of each term is explained as follows .",
    "the binomials @xmath49 represents the number of ways to group @xmath36 helical residues into @xmath38 helices .",
    "the terms @xmath50 and @xmath51 are similar , representing the number of ways to group beta residues into @xmath1-strands and @xmath1-strands into @xmath1-sheets , respectively . here",
    "each @xmath1-sheet has at least two strands ; and each @xmath1-strand has at least two residues .",
    "the binomial @xmath52 represents how many ways to insert @xmath48 coil residues between the secondary structure elements , such that consecutive helix and strand are separated by at least @xmath22 coil residues .",
    "the last factor @xmath53 represents how many ways to arrange the order of @xmath0-helices and @xmath1-strands .",
    "note that here the @xmath0-helices are considered as identical .",
    "the @xmath1-strands are assumed to connect to only the neighboring ones .",
    "long - distance connections in @xmath1-sheets are neglected , since the usual adopted arrangements are quite limited at room temperature .",
    "one may propose other assumptions .",
    "for example , @xmath1-strands are assumed to be able to connect to each other freely ( @xmath54 ) , despite their length and distance . or all @xmath0-helices and @xmath1-strands are considered as distinguishable ( @xmath55 ) , in case of very strong long - range interactions between secondary structure elements .",
    "different assumptions may give different results , but the general property of transition is almost unchanged , according to our simulations .",
    "further discussions are shown in the appendix .",
    "the partition function can be rewritten according to the structure of the chain as follows : @xmath56 where @xmath57 here @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) represents the partition function for the states of all @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) structures , and @xmath60 for @xmath9 mixed structures .    in the following",

    "we define the fraction of helical and beta residues respectively as @xmath61 the normalized number of @xmath0-helices and @xmath1-strands are also of interest . @xmath62",
    "from discussions in previous section , it is easy to show that in the absence of long - range interaction , the partition function(@xmath63 ) is the same as that for helix / coil transition , which has been well studied by z - b model . in following ,",

    ", the parameter @xmath22 has only minor effect on the results . here",
    ", we will set @xmath29 for the minimum number of coil residues between secondary structures .      at first",
    ", we study the transition from random coil to regular @xmath1-sheet(@xmath64 ) , which is similar to helix / coil transition@xcite .    in this case",
    ", we have three tuneable parameters : @xmath23 for local constraint of single residue , @xmath24 for long - range bonding interactions between a pair of bonded @xmath1-strands and @xmath31 for initiation correction of a @xmath1-sheet .",

    "[ bct](a ) , [ bct](c ) , we can see that when @xmath23 is increasing , the fraction of beta residues @xmath65 goes from zero to unity monotonously .",
    "this means the random coils turn into regular @xmath1-sheets when the local interactions become stronger .",
    "this transition usually happens at @xmath70 , in accordance with z - b model .",
    "the sharpness of transition depends on @xmath24 and @xmath31 .",
    "the smaller @xmath24 or @xmath31 is , the sharper the transition will be .    unlike the fraction of @xmath1 residues , which increases monotonously with respect to @xmath23 , the number of @xmath1-strands increases firstly to reach a peak at around the transition point , and then decreases when @xmath23 keeps increasing ( fig .",
    "[ bct](b),(d ) ) .",
    "we argue that this is a consequence of the competition between short and long - range interactions . generally speaking , when @xmath23 is less than unity , short - range interactions prompt long - range interactions . with the increment of @xmath23",
    ", there tends to be more @xmath1-strands , as well as the strands get longer .",
    "thus @xmath65 and @xmath66 increase simultaneously .",
    "when @xmath23 is larger than unity , short - range interactions suppress long - range interactions . as a consequence ,",
    "when @xmath23 is increasing further , @xmath65 is almost unchanged while @xmath66 drops continuously .",
    "it means that there tends to be less @xmath1-strands and the strands still grow longer and longer .",
    "a more interesting result is @xmath0-helix/@xmath1-sheet transition . since the major difference of @xmath1-sheet from @xmath0-helix is the existence of long - range interaction , which is described by parameters @xmath24 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus not only the increase of local effect @xmath23 , but also the increment of long - range interaction parameters @xmath24 and @xmath31 can induce a transition from helical structure to beta structure(fig .",

    "we argue that this is not by chance , but is a prerequisite for proteins in living cells .",
