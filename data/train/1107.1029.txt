    "the pre - amorphization of silicon by high dose ion implantation is one of the identified processes for the realization of the ultra - thin junctions of the technological nodes 65 nm and below of the silicon microelectronics industry .",
    "the transformation of crystalline ( c - si ) into amorphous silicon ( a - si ) on a layer close to the surface reduces the channeling of the dopant consecutively implanted .",
    "such a technological stage is therefore required to limit the penetration into the substrate of small radius atoms such as boron , the standard @xmath0 dopant in microelectronics @xcite .",
    "the pre - amorphization and the dopant implant might be followed :    * by an annealing at a temperature low enough ( @xmath1 700 @xmath2c ) to recrystallize the amorphous layer and activate the doping , but insufficient to cause a significative diffusion of the dopant .",
    "reference gives such an example , with a depth of the junction at 10@xmath3 @xmath4 of @xmath516 - 19@xmath6 $ ] nm compatible with the values @xmath510 - 19@xmath6 $ ] nm targeted by the itrs roadmap @xcite .",
    "likewise , the high level of activation allows to reach sheet resistances of @xmath5405 -785@xmath6 $ ] @xmath7 to compare with the range @xmath5760 - 830@xmath6 $ ] @xmath7 of the itrs roadmap .",
    "* by an annealing at very high temperature ( laser or spike annealing ) . in the case where the melting temperature of a - si is reached ,",
    "the profile after annealing has an ideal  square - like \" shape as the diffusivity of the dopant is higher in the liquid than in the crystal .",
    "an example of such a profile is given in the reference . while ideal for a full wafer implantation , this solution however is not always compatible with the other technological stages @xcite .",
    "the other alternative is to anneal just beneath the melting temperature ( ex : 1300 @xmath2c ) during a very short duration ( ex : spike of 330 @xmath8s wide at 1250 @xmath2c ) to limit the dopant diffusion @xcite .    in the two cases , it is critical to have a good understanding of the recrystallization process of the amorphous layer to develop such technologies .",
    "if , on the one hand , the recrystallization velocity by solid phase epitaxy ( spe ) of an amorphous layer is well known from experiments in the intrinsic case @xcite , this is not the case in presence of impurities where accelerations , slowdown , compensation and even hysteresis are observed @xcite .",
    "moreover in this case , the final distribution of the dopant is intimately related to the velocity of recrystallization .",
    "now , this case of doped a - si is precisely of current interest for the formation of junctions . in the absence of an experimentally established law , is it possible to calculate at the atomic level the recyrstallisation velocity of doped a - si ?",
    "atomistic simulations of a - si , of its interface with c - si and of its recrystallization have already been published @xcite . however in these works the atomistic simulations of the recrystallization of a - si are not always exploited to extract the recrystallization velocity @xmath9 . the comparison with experiments",
    "is most often limited to the activation energy of @xmath9 . moreover ,",
    "the description of silicon by means of empirical interatomic potential is not unique and the question of the most adapted one(s ) for this particular case is still open .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a systematic study of the recrystallization velocity as a function of the annealing temperature for the various interatomic potentials available for silicon .",
    "the present work has been devoted to the intrinsic case , that already appears an issue by itself .    in this paper ,",
    "we begin by a presentation of the method of simulation we have used to model the a - si , its recrystallization and the extraction of the recrystallization velocity .",
    "the results are then presented for five different interatomic potentials in the second part . in the last part",
    ", the wide differences obtained as a function of the interatomic potential are analyzed and an explanation is proposed based on a possible transformation of the amorphous layer into a liquid one .",
    "this section is first devoted to a discussion about the different empirical interatomic potentials used in the molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "next , the description of the method used to build the a - si cluster and to its properties is presented .",
    "the generation of the a - si / c - si structure is also reported .",
    "finally , the simulation of the recrystallization of a - si on c - si with molecular dynamics is described .",
    "the systematic exploitation of these atomistic simulations to determine the recrystallization velocity is also explained in details .      in this article , the annealing of the a - si on c - si stack was investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulation employing empirical interatomic potentials .",
    "interatomic potentials are an efficient way to describe the interaction between atoms using a continuous and derivable functional of the atomic positions .",
    "as they do not contain deep physical effects as in ab - initio description , their domain of validity is not universal .",
    "most often , interatomic potential are developed on a particular application such as the study of surfaces or the description of a phase transition .",
    "five empirical potentials developed for silicon were tested in this study : the stillinger - weber potential in its original parametrisation @xcite and in a recent parametrisation called sw115 @xcite designed for a better description of the melting of a - si and c - si , the third formulation of the tersoff s potential @xcite , the environment dependent interatomic potential ( edip ) @xcite and the lenosky s pontential @xcite . to our knowledge , these are the main potentials used in the literature to describe silicon .",
    "the 4 functional forms ( stillinger - weber and sw115 have the same formulation ) contain an attractive and a repulsive part given in the form of continuous functions of the relative distance between pairs of atoms , with a two - body and a three - body character , respectively .",
    "these functional forms are adjusted to reproduce the @xmath10 equilibrium crystalline structure , cohesive energy , elastic constants and possibly other structural or energetic parameters of crystalline si .",
    "the stillinger - weber potential has a three - body term that imposes the angle @xmath11 between the three neighbors to @xmath12 and therefore strictly enforces the diamond structure .",
    "the edip potential is inspired from the stillinger - weber potential , but it adapts to the coordination ( 4 , 3 , 2 , ... ) of the atom and it is therefore more general .",
    "the formulation of the tersoff potential is slightly different from the two previous ones , and has the form of a pair potential with a bonding strength that contains the dependence upon the local atomic environment .",
    "finally , the lenosky is a modified embedded - atom method including a pairwise embedding functional and an angular term . which potential should be more adapted to our case is not obvious a priori .",
    "therefore simulations with these 5 different potentials were performed .",
    "amorphous silicon in silicon devices is created by ion implantation of heavy ions .",
    "ideally , the best approach would be to mimic the experiment and therefore to simulate the ion implantation .",
    "however , it is not currently realistic since the simulation of the implantation of an ion and of all the interactions and collisions with the atoms of the target by molecular dynamics is already computer resources consuming , and many events of that kinds should be simulated to obtain an a - si layer of good quality . the other alternative is to construct a cluster of amorphous silicon and to glue it on crystalline silicon .",
    "the main two methods to form an amorphous structure starting from the crystal are a ) the disordering of tetrahedral interatomic bonds by the method of wooten , winer and weaire ( www)@xcite and its derivatives @xcite and b ) the simulation of an idealized a - si , obtained by a melting followed by a quenching to a solid but amorphous state @xcite .",
    "we will call this second method the  melting - quenching \" .",
    "each of these two methods has its advantages and drawbacks .",
    "the main disadvantage of the www method is to enforce a tetravalent coordination , while it is experimentally known @xcite that a - si contains defects which may be floating or dangling bonds .",
    "the simulation of the melting - quenching on the other hand , done using a molecular dynamics simulation with an empirical potential , relies first on the ability of the potential to correctly describes a liquid at elevated temperature , and second to correctly describe the amorphous structure upon quenching , which is not unconditionally ensured for neither of these two aspects as emphasized later ( see section [ discussion ] ) .    in the present work ,",
    "the results are obtained with a www a - si .",
    "the reason for this choice is first to construct an amorphous cluster of good quality , and next paragraph will discuss of this point .",
    "moreover , the objective was to test which of the numerous empirical interatomic potential developed to model silicon @xcite is the more adapted to keep the amorphous structure and to give the recrystallization velocity measured by solid phase epitaxy experiments @xcite . using the melting - quenching method",
    "would have required to construct for each potential its corresponding amorphous cluster , which , while more rigorous than the use of a unique www amorphous cluster , would have introduced different amorphous structures .",
    "therefore all the results presented in the section [ sectres ] have been obtained with the same initial a - si cluster constructed by the method presented just below . on the other side , we believe that , once the choice of the most adapted interactomic potential has been made , the better approach should on the contrary be the simulation of the melting - quenching - recrystallization with this potential .      the www @xcite a - si structure is obtained using an algorithm of bond switching between pairs of first neighbours . the total energy associated to this bond reordering",
    "is originally calculated using a keating potential @xcite .",
    "a maxwell - boltzmann probability is then determined with this energy and a temperature . in this way",
    ", an elevated value of the temperature can be used at the beginning of the amorphisation to strongly disorder the structure , and be subsequently decreased to reduce the number of defects in order to obtain a very realistic a - si .",
    "this procedure was applied to an initial cluster of 4096 atoms of c - si .",
    "the current paragraph presents the properties of the www a - si cluster of 4096 atoms and the comparison with published experiments .",
    "the side of the initial cubic cluster of c - si is of @xmath13=43.44  .",
    "the density before amorphisation is therefore equal to @xmath14=@xmath15 = 0.0500 at / @xmath16 .",
    "after amorphisation , the dimensions of the cluster are slightly reduced : @xmath17=43.38  .",
    "the density is therefore 0.4% higher ( @xmath14=0.0502 at / @xmath16 ) .",
    "this feature is in disagreement with experiments where a reduction of the density of approximately 1.8 % has been measured @xcite .",
    "this difference might be due to the dilatation and to the strain induced by the implantation at high dose and high energy ( @xmath18 mev ) used in the experimental articles @xcite , both effects neglected in the model .",
    "it is not obvious to simulate these macroscopic effects at the atomic level .",
    "moreover , it is not sure that this rather slight difference is significative of a problem in the model .    the angular distribution of the bonds between first neighbours is shown in fig .",
    "[ figangdist ] .",
    "the mean angle of the distribution is equal to 109.1@xmath19 and the standard deviation is equal to 10.6@xmath19 , in excellent agreement with the work of djordevic et al.@xcite .",
    "the pair correlation function @xmath20 , i.e. the probability to find an atom between the spheres of radius @xmath21 and @xmath22 centered on any atom is given in fig .",
    "[ figraddist ] .",
    "@xmath20 is calculated using the radial distribution @xmath23  : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the density of c - si .",
    "the radial distribution is the number of neighbours at the distance @xmath21  : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the distance between atoms @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 the total number of atoms .",
    "the abscissa of the maxima of the pair correlation function ( see fig .",
    "[ figraddist ] ) corresponds to the distances between first ( 2.35 ) , second ( 3.83 ) , third ( 5.43 ) and even fourth ( 6.62 ) neighbours .",
    "the peaks are of course enlarged due to the disorder in a - si compared to c - si , but at least three peaks are clearly distinguishable and the first and second peaks are clearly separated , with a gap to @xmath20=0 between the two peaks .",
    "the pair correlation function is not directly comparable to experiments .",
    "therefore its fourier transform was calculated to extract the structure factor @xmath31 , given in fig .",
    "[ figfactstruc ] .",
    "the shape , the position and the intensity of the peaks is in perfect agreement with the structure factor measured by laaziri et al .",
    "@xcite on a - si obtained by ion implantation , except a slight underestimation of the intensity of the first peak .",
    "this agreement is significative of the good description of the local order in the www a - si .",
    "to conclude , although the discrepancy on the density , the www a - si has excellent geometrical characteristics and the structure factor is in good agreement with experiments .",
    "therefore the quality of the a - si structure is adapted to the objective of this study .",
    "the resulting amorphous cluster of 4096 atoms ( 43.38    each side ) was then truncated and glued along the [ 100 ] surface of the c - si cell to form the interfacial structure @xcite .",
    "the structure contains 1905 atoms and the crystal part of the interfacial structure corresponds to 50% of the global thickness .",
    "it has been observed that the crystalline thickness is an important factor since it appears in some cases that a recrystallization of the a - si layer was obtained for the bigger structure while the disorder propagated in the c - si part of the smaller structure ( 21% of the global thickness ) although the two atomic layers at the bottom of the structure were frozen at their perfect diamond lattice site to eventually compensate the thin thickness of the crystalline part .",
    "tests on bigger stack ( 8034 atoms ) did not give significantly different recrystallization velocities than with the stack of 1905 atoms .",
    "since the computational time is drastically increased for this stack of 8034 atoms , we dropped it and focused the work on the 1905 atoms interfacial system .",
    "table [ table : interface_coordination ] presents the mean coordination number and the silicion defects distribution of the initial interface .",
    "the statistics have been estimated for all the silicon atoms located at less than 2.35 of the interface both for the cristal and the amorphous part .",
    "a cut - off distance of 2.7 has been used to calculate the first neighbours .",
    "large amount of threefold and twofold silicons defects are present initially due to the difficulty to perfectly align an amorphous interface and a perfect crystal .    in order to improve the interface quality , prior to the main recrystallisation step",

    "an objective is to relax the interface and to reach the temperature targeted value for the main recrystallisation simulation .",
    "periodic boundary conditions only along the lateral directions have been used allowing the system to relax along the regrowth direction . the equilibration phase is performed during 4 ps at the targeted temperature value using a 2 fs time step for the velocity verlet algorithm . during this equilibration ,",

    "first of all , it has been checked that during this equilibration step , no real recrystallisation occurs ( the interface variation is less than 0.4 for all the inter - atomic potential ) .",
    "the equilibration step improves the quality of the interface since the fraction of fourfold silicon atoms is enhanced for almost all interatomic potentials . on the other side , the choice of the interatomic potential has a clear influence on the defects at the interface even for a very short annealing .",
    "after equilibration , both tersoff and sw115 tend to favorize the presence of threefold defects . on the other side ,",
    "fivefold silicon atoms are the most dominant defects with the sw , edip and lenosky potentials .",

    "the speed of the recrystallization is governed by the transformation of liquid silicon ( l - si ) into c - si . in the case of explosive recrystallization of a - si",
    ", the liquid is formed at the a - si / c - si interface due to a local heating by the release of heat generated by the transition from a - si to c - si @xcite .",

    "[ figopt1673 ] ) .",
    "[ figopsw1273 ] clearly demonstrates that the disordered silicon for @xmath51 , while amorphous at the origin , transforms to a liquid during the initial equilibration stage .",

    "on the contrary with the tersoff potential , the order parameter remains in the range @xmath50.6 - 0.8@xmath6 $ ] during all the process of recrystallization .",
    "this is a first proof that the a - si initially constructed is transformed into l - si when the stillinger - weber potential is used , while it remains amorphous with the tersoff potential .",
    "one could argue that these differences of behavior are due to the ability of the interatomic potentials to correctly predict the experimental melting temperature of a - si .",
    "indeed , the melting temperature of a - si , @xmath52 , is measured in the range @xmath51420 - 1530@xmath6 $ ] k@xcite .",
    "however , the tersoff potential is known for its large overestimation of the melting temperature , for c - si as for a - si : marqus et al . @xcite have determined a value of that the melting temperature of @xmath52 = 2050 k , while for the stillinger - weber potential , a value of @xmath52 = 1400 k was found by brambilla et al .",
    "@xcite and 1075 k by albenze et al .",
    "@xcite . indeed , fig .",
    "[ figopsw(t ) ] shows that the temperature used with the stillinger - weber potential must be decreased to @xmath5473 - 673@xmath6 $ ] k to keep an order parameter of the amorphous kind after the initial equilibration stage .",
    "therefore we think that not only the melting temperature enter into account but more globally the ability of the potential to handle or not an amorphous structure .",
    "the stillinger - weber potential clearly favors the liquid state , as already observed in the literature @xcite .    in order to further corroborate the transformation to a liquid state , the radial and angular distribution of the atoms",
    "have been calculated in the disordered layer after the equilibration stage .",
    "the results are respectively presented in fig .",
    "[ figraddistrequ ] and [ figangdistrequ ] . after a simulation with the tersoff and sw115 potentials ,",
    "the typical characteristics of an amorphous material are preserved : distinct peak of the second neighbours with a gap between first and second neighbours , and angular distribution comparable to the initial one ( www a - si ) . with stillinger - weber ,",
    "edip and lenosky on the other hand , there is no gap between the peaks of the first and second neighbors in the radial distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ figraddistrequ ] ) , these second peak being even much less pronounced .",
    "moreover , the angular distribution is drastically smeared out ( see fig . [ figangdistrequ ] ) .",
    "all such structural features are far more typical of a liquid @xcite .",
    "consequently , our understanding of md simulations of the recrystallization of a - si using empirical potentials is the following .",
    "the tersoff and sw115 potentials are adapted to the description of the spe .",
    "the amorphous character is preserved with these potentials and the velocity of recrystallization follows an arrhenius law as observed experimentally .",
    "the sw115 potential gives however a recrystallization velocity two orders of magnitude faster than the experiment .",
    "the tersoff potential gives an excellent agreement with the law of olson and roth@xcite .",
    "its drawback is its excessive value of the melting temperature ( for a - si as for c - si ) .",
    "we have tried to apply a simple rescaling of the temperature @xmath53 , @xmath54 in the case of the tersoff potential .",
    "this approach is not satisfying since the simulation has moved away from the experiment by nearly 4 order of magnitudes as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtempnorm ] .",
    "the stillinger - weber , edip and lenosky potentials are not adapted to the simulation of the spe of a - si .",
    "these three potentials seem to have a tendency to transform the amorphous structure into a liquid one , even below the nominal bulk melting temperature .",
    "nevertheless , the resort to the stillinger - weber potential is perfectly justified to simulate the lpe , the experimental results obtained by pulse laser annealing @xcite being in the margin of incertitude of our simulations .",
    "the sluggish behavior of the edip potential , already mentioned by albenze and clancy @xcite , is due to its formulation developed to handle non - tetrahedral environments .",
    "this environment dependency is a disadvantage for this particular problem , the return to the crystal arrangement is not enough enforced .",
    "finally , the lenosky potential is also a good candidate for the simulation of lpe if the temperature is scaled to account for the differences in metling temperatures ( see fig .",
    "[ figtempnorm ] ) .",
    "the recrystallization of an amorphous silicon layer on a crystalline silicon substrate has been simulated by means of molecular dynamics .",
    "the initial a - si on c - si stack has been constructed by the www method and the structural properties of the resulting amorphous were carefully analyzed to validate the atomic arrangement in the structure with respect to the available experimental results .",
    "subsequently , the annealing of this amorphous - crystal stack was studied using five of the most widely used interatomic potentials for silicon .",
    "a systematic campaign of molecular dynamics simulations as a function of temperature in the appropriate interval to observe amorphous recrystallization was carried out to extract the velocity of recrystallization versus the temperature .",
    "a wide disparity is obtained as a function of the interatomic potential , underscoring the limitations of the different empirical potentials that are not able to treat with an equivalent and consistent degree of accuracy the three si phases of interest in the technological process ( diamond crystal , amorphous and liquid ) .",
    "a similar shortcoming had been already pointed out by ding and andersen @xcite for the case of germanium .",
    "however , the results can be classified in two categories .",
    "the first category is the expected solid phase epitaxy of the a - si , obtained with the tersoff and sw115 potentials .",
    "the second category corresponds rather to a liquid phase epitaxy as obtained with the potentials of stillinger - weber , edip or lenosky , due to the transformation of the starting a - si cluster into a liquid one .",
    "the reliability of the empirical potential molecular dynamics compared to experiments is shown to be very good , provided that a suitable potential is chosen to investigate each different phenomenology .",
    "based on the results of the present study , the best candidates turn out to be tersoff for the spe and stillinger - weber for the lpe .",
    "this work is part of the common laboratory stmicroelectronics / iemn supported by the minefi .",
    "the numerous computer simulations would not have been possible without the reliable park of workstations managed by jean - michel droulez .",
    "the authors thank w. windl for the suggestion to look at the lenosky potential and guy allan for discussion about the amorphous cluster .",
    ".distribution of the mean coordination number for the initial a - si / c - si interface .",
    "the evolution of this distribution during the equilibration step of4 ps with the various interatomic potential is also represented for the same condtions ( velocity scaling , 1273k ) .",
    "the equilibration step improves the quality of the interface since the fraction of fourfold silicon atoms is obviously enhanced . on the other side , the choice of the interatomic potential has a clear influence on the defects at the interface even for a very short annealing .
