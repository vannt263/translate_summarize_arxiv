    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are generally considered to be good tracers of a galaxy s star formation history .",
    "bimodal colour distributions are observed in many gc systems , suggesting that galaxies undergo multiple epochs of star and gc formation ( harris 2001 ) .",
    "the exact nature of how these multiple star formation events occur is crucial to understanding galaxy formation .",
    "ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) describe the production of metal - rich gcs during the merger of two gas - rich disc galaxies .",
    "this scenario results in similar ages for the metal - rich gcs and the merger event . in this model",
    "the blue , metal - poor gcs which belonged to the progenitor galaxies are universally old ( @xmath0 gyr ) .",
    "forbes , brodie & grillmair ( 1997 ) propose a multi - phase collapse , during which metal - poor gcs form early during the pre - galaxy collapse phase and , at a later time , metal - rich gcs form out of more enriched gas at a similar time to the galaxy field stars .",
    "this model implies a metal - rich population that is a few gyr younger than the metal - poor population .",
    "the exact age difference may depend on mass and environment ( beasley 2002 ) . on the other hand , cote ,",
    "marzke & west ( 1998 ) suggest the bimodality of gc colours in large ellipticals is due to the gradual accretion of metal - poor gcs from dwarfs , with metal - rich gcs being indigenous to the elliptical . in this picture , the metallicity of the metal - rich population is a function of the galaxy s luminosity and both sub - populations should be old .",
    "these physical processes may all occur to some extent . to distinguish between the relative contributions of each process",
    ", we need examples of elliptical galaxies covering a range of masses and in different environments . given that the above gc formation scenarios have different expectations concerning the ages of the metal - poor and metal - rich sub - populations , determining the age of individual gcs is a crucial step in testing these models .",
    "there are several methods to measure gc properties such as age and metallicity from integrated spectra .",
    "examples include the method of brodie & huchra ( 1990 ; hereafter bh90 ) , who present an empirical metallicity measure based on absorption line features .",
    "another method is that of strader & brodie ( 2004 ; hereafter sb04 ) , based on a principal components analysis ( pca ) of 11 absorption line features .",
    "methods involving spectral indices , predominantly the lick system , and their comparison to simple stellar population ( ssp ) models can break the age - metallicity degeneracy ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "these methods usually rely on an age sensitive index ( e.g. , h@xmath6 ) and a metallicity sensitive index ( e.g. , mgb ) to break the degeneracy . however , these methods suffer difficulties when individual indices are contaminated , due to cosmic rays , skyline subtraction or galactic emission .",
    "another complication is non - solar @xmath4-abundance ratios which are difficult to determine from index - index plots and can affect the higher order balmer indices ( thomas , maraston & korn 2004 ) .",
    "recently , proctor & sansom ( 2002 ; hereafter ps02 ) have used a multi - index @xmath7minimisation method to obtain ages , metallicities and abundance ratios for the stellar populations of late and early - type galaxies .",
    "another advantage of using many indices is that it maximises the information used to break the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "here we extend this method to extragalactic gcs for the first time ( see proctor , forbes & beasley 2004 for an application to galactic gcs ) .",
    "hot luminous blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars have a significant effect on the measurement of several indices ( most notably the balmer indices , see lee , yoon & lee 2000 ) .",
    "studies of galactic gcs show that those with similar ages and metallicities can have very different spectral contributions from their hb stars depending on whether the hb stars are hot ( blue ) or cool ( red ) . the way the hb is modelled has a significant impact on a ssp model ( maraston , greggio & thomas 2001a ) .",
    "a colour - magnitude diagram is probably the best way to deduce hb morphology in a given gc , but such diagrams are limited to gcs in the very nearest galaxies .",
    "thus information on hbs in extragalactic gcs must generally come from integrated spectra .",
    "old metal - rich gcs with bhbs ( e.g. , ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 ; rich 1997 ) can falsely appear to be intermediate - age clusters due to this strengthening of the balmer lines ( schiavon 2004 ) , therefore , the ability to deduce hb morphology from integrated spectra is important . schiavon ( 2004 )",
    "have recently introduced a method to detect anomalous hbs in gc spectra by differential comparisons of h@xmath8 , h@xmath9 , and h@xmath6 line strengths .",
    "there is evidence for a significant number of proto - gcs in galaxies which are currently merging ( e.g. , the antennae ; whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) and very recent ( @xmath10500 myr ) mergers such as ngc 7252 ( maraston 2001b ; schweizer & seitzer 1998 ; miller 1997 ) and ngc 3921 ( schweizer , seitzer & brodie 2004 ; schweizer 1996 ) . the outstanding questions are whether a substantial fraction of the proto - gc sub - population formed in these mergers survives , and hence whether it can account for the gc systems of ellipticals ( see forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ) .    an important link between ongoing mergers and `` old '' elliptical galaxies",
    "is the intermediate aged ( 2 - 5 gyr ) merger remnants .",
    "previous gc spectroscopic studies of merger remnant galaxies such as ngc 1316 ( goudfrooij 2001 ) and ngc 3610 ( strader 2003 ; strader , brodie & forbes 2004 ) have confirmed a small number of gcs with ages matching the time since the merger event ( @xmath11 gyr and @xmath1 gyr respectively ) .",
    "however , the total number of intermediate - age gcs in these galaxies is currently poorly constrained spectroscopically .    in this work",
    "we examine the gc system of ngc  1052 , which is an excellent candidate for an elliptical that has undergone a minor merger event in the last few gyr .",
    "ngc  1052 is an e4 galaxy , located in a small group at a distance of 18 mpc ( forbes , georgakakis & brodie 2001b ) . aside from containing an active nucleus ,",
    "ngc  1052 displays several indications of a past merger or significant accretion event .",
    "the gas angular momentum is higher than that of the stellar component , with the gas and stars having different rotation axes ( van gorkom 1986 , plana & boulesteix 1996 ) .",
    "ngc  1052 also reveals hi tidal tails ( van gorkom 1986 ) , infalling hi gas onto the active nucleus ( van gorkom 1989 ) and dust lanes ( forbes , sparks & macchetto 1990 ) all signs of an accretion or merger .",
    "van gorkom ( 1986 ) suggest that the hi observations could be explained by the accretion of a gas - rich dwarf , or other minor interaction , about 1 gyr ago .    despite the evidence for a recent accretion event , ngc  1052 shows almost no optical disturbance ( it has a low fine structure value of @xmath12 = 1.78 , schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) and has a fundamental plane residual of + 0.07 ( prugniel & simien 1996 ) which is consistent with a normal galaxy on the fundamental plane ( forbes , ponman & brown 1998 ) .",
    "we can further probe the evolutionary history of ngc  1052 by measuring the ages and metallicities of individual gcs in the galaxy .",
    "the imaging of forbes ( 2001b ) revealed a bimodal gc system as is typical for elliptical galaxies .",
    "the two sub - populations had a colour difference of @xmath13b  i=0.4@xmath140.1 .",
    "using worthey ( 1994 ) models , under the assumption that the blue gc sub - population is 15 gyr old and metal - poor with [ fe / h]=1.5 , forbes ( 2001b ) showed that any newly - formed red gcs ( assuming ages of @xmath152.5 gyr ) must have supersolar metallicities to fully account for the red sub - population .",
    "in section [ sec_obs ] we will present our observations and data reduction methods .",
    "measured indices and our analysis of these lick indices are given in section [ sec_inds ] . using the method of ps02 , metallicities , ages and abundance ratios are given in section [ sec_aam ] .",
    "spectra of ngc  1052 itself are given in section [ sec_long ] and a brief analysis of gc kinematic data is in section [ sec_gal ] . finally we discuss the implications of our results in section [ sec_disc ] and present conclusions in section [ sec_conc ] .",
    "spectra of gc candidates around ngc  1052 were obtained with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke 1995 ) on the keck i telescope .",
    "candidate selection , based on the keck imaging data of forbes ( 2001b ) , was designed to cover a wide range of potential gc colours ( i.e. 1.2 @xmath10 b ",
    "i @xmath10 2.5 , 0.6 @xmath10 v ",
    "i @xmath10 1.7 ) .",
    "the properties of our candidates can be found in table 1 .",
    "observations were obtained in 2003 january 25 - 27 with an integration time of @xmath16s = 8 hours for the slit - mask .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise ratios of the combined spectra were improved by excluding the exposures made at the highest airmass . these suffered from signal - to - noise degradation , especially at bluer wavelengths . seeing ranged between 0.65@xmath17 and 0.75@xmath17 over the three nights . a 600 lines per mm grating blazed at 4000",
    "  was used for the blue side , resulting in an approximate wavelength range of 3300 - 5900   and a fwhm spectral resolution of @xmath18  .",
    "table 1 presents observational data for the objects for which we obtained keck spectra .",
    "figure [ n1052colour ] , a b ",
    "i colour magnitude diagram , shows that we have obtained spectra from both the blue and red sub - populations of gc candidates .",
    "we have also generally sampled the most luminous gcs in ngc  1052 .",
    "if any young ( @xmath19 few gyrs old ) gcs exist then they will tend to be brighter than the old population .",
    "plotted in figure [ positions ] are the spatial positions of the confirmed gcs .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ , > , > \" , ]     [ tablefits ]    lick indices were measured for the galaxy at each radius and the same offset to the lick system was applied as per the gc data .",
    "denicolo ( 2005 ) presents indices , measured along the major axis of ngc  1052 , which are consistent with our observed values .",
    "several indices show gradients with galactocentric radius . a sample of these are plotted in figure [ radial ] , showing some clear radial trends .",
    "the metallicity and [ e / fe ] sensitive indices ( e.g. , cn@xmath20 and mg@xmath21 ) have a strong gradient towards higher values in the centre .",
    "a similar trend is observed for other [ e / fe ] sensitive indices , e.g. , mgb .",
    "the fe5270 line , which is primarily sensitive to iron metallicity [ fe / h ] , shows almost no gradient .",
    "other fe lines such as fe4383 , fe4531 and fe5406 also show no gradient with radius .",
    "these trends are also evident in the denicolo ( 2005 ) data .",
    "the galaxy therefore posses strong gradients in [ e / fe ] sensitive indices , but no gradients in the [ fe / h ] sensitive indices .",
    "the effect of central galactic emission is obvious in the h@xmath6 index plot , with large negative values at small radii .",
    "the other balmer indices and fe5015 are similarly affected by emission .",
    "due to the high total metallicity of the galaxy , we use the fe method from ps02 as opposed to the trager ( 2000a ) method used earlier to calculate the [ e / fe ] .",
    "this is necessary because the isochrone shape is driven by [ z / h ] at low metallicity and [ fe / h ] at high metallicity ( see ps02 for a full explanation ) .",
    "due to the high @xmath4element abundance ratios present in the galaxy , we extrapolate the tmk04 models to [ e / fe]=+0.9 .",
    "figure [ mgbfe ] demonstrates the extremely high abundance ratios present in the central regions by showing a plot of @xmath10fe@xmath22 vs mgb , where @xmath10fe@xmath22=(fe5270+fe5335)/2 .    to obtain reasonable fits to the tmk04 ssp models it was necessary to exclude several indices from all apertures during the fitting process .",
    "galactic emission which increases towards the centre , forces the removal of all the balmer lines and fe5015 from the fitting process .",
    "the index c4668 was also removed due to its systematic deviance from the best fit .",
    "we also clipped individual deviant indices following a similar method to section 3.3 .",
    "this resulted in a total of 12% of the remaining indices being removed ( mostly mg@xmath20 , ca4455 and fe4383 ) .",
    "we were unable to obtain reasonable fits for the central aperture , probably due to strong galactic emission , and do not present the fitted parameters for it .",
    "the values obtained for age , [ fe / h ] , [ e / fe ] and [ z / h ] are presented in table 5 and also plotted against radius in figure [ longall ] .",
    "figure [ longall ] shows no strong radial gradient in either age or [ fe / h ] .",
    "there is however a very strong gradient of decreasing [ e / fe ] with increasing radius . in the central arcsecond the estimated [ e / fe ] of @xmath19",
    "+ 0.8 dex is unusually high .",
    "using the kinematic information from the 16 gcs , we can estimate the mass enclosed within the radius of the gc system observed .",
    "we use the projected mass estimator ( evans 2003 ) , assuming isotropy and an r@xmath23 distribution to derive a mass of 1.7@xmath24 within 19 kpc ( @xmath25 r@xmath26 ) .",
    "the mass estimate error was calculated by bootstrapping the observed velocities and errors .",
    "van gorkom ( 1986 ) used hi kinematics to measure a mass of @xmath27 within 23 kpc .",
    "we have limited spatial coverage and too few gcs to make any comment on systematic rotation of the gc system . since our mass estimate is significantly higher than that for the hi kinematics , our assumption of isotropy may be incorrect .",
    "for example , if the orbits had a rather strong tangental bias of @xmath28/@xmath29 = 2 , then our tracer mass estimate would be 30% too large ( evans et al .",
    "to summarise , we have obtained spectra for 16 gcs which sample both the blue and red sub - populations in ngc  1052 .",
    "ages , metallicities and abundance ratios for these gcs have been derived using the multi - line fitting technique of ps02 applied to the ssps of tmk04 .",
    "we find that the blue gcs in ngc  1052 to be uniformly old @xmath3010 gyr and metal - poor ( with the exception of gc47 for which we strongly suspect an incorrect colour ) .",
    "the red gcs are similarly old but metal - rich .",
    "we do not find any young gcs associated with the recent merger event , even though we have sampled the expected colour and luminosity regime for young gcs .",
    "we do , however find evidence for young _ galaxy _ stars associated with the merger event .",
    "our luminosity - weighted age of @xmath1 gyr for the ngc 1052 stars is compatible with that estimated from the hi tidal tails and infalling hi gas of @xmath5 gyr ( van gorkom 1986 ) .",
    "the high central value and strong gradient observed for [ e / fe ] in ngc 1052 is unusual for an elliptical galaxy .",
    "for example , mehlert ( 2003 ) find negligible gradients in [ e / fe ] for 35 early - type galaxies in their sample of coma galaxies .",
    "proctor ( 2002 ) using the same method as this work finds a maximum [ e / fe]@xmath31 + 0.4 and no significant [ e / fe ] gradient in the bulges of 28 late and early - type galaxies .",
    "the @xmath4element abundance ratio for ngc  1052 is largely insensitive to the combination of indices we fit , unlike age and metallicity .",
    "therefore , barring a major contamination of all the [ e / fe ] sensitive indices ( which must also affect the observations of denicolo 2005 ) we can confidently say that the central galaxy starlight is more @xmath4element enhanced than @xmath2 dex .",
    "such @xmath4element enhancements and the deduced high central metallicities ( [ z / h]=+1.3 dex ) are far beyond current ssp models .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to pin down exact values for the central galaxy field stars . at [ z / h]=+1.3",
    "the total metallicity would be 20 times that of the sun , implying a metal content by mass of @xmath1940% .",
    "this value is unrealistically high , which suggesting that our extrapolations beyond the current ssp models are unreliable .",
    "van gorkom ( 1986 ) speculated that ngc  1052 had accreted a gas - rich dwarf galaxy about 1 gyr ago .",
    "they find a total hi mass of @xmath32 which seems consistent with this idea .",
    "such a small quantity of gas could also explain why we have detected no gcs forming in this merger ( even allowing for some cold gas to have been used up in field star formation and/or ionised )",
    ". even a small burst by mass will give a young age for the galaxy central stars ( terlevich & forbes 2002 ) .",
    "our results also indicate that the central merger - induced starburst involved very high metallicity and @xmath4element enhanced gas .",
    "such high metallicity gas is not usually associated with dwarf galaxies but massive spirals .",
    "the most obvious explanation for the high @xmath4element enhancement is a high central concentration type ii supernovae from the starburst .",
    "inflows over any significant timescale are less likely , since no radial metallicity gradient is seen",
    ". a spiral galaxy with a small bulge and on - going star formation in the disk could produce the young central ages observed without star formation from the merger itself being the dominant luminosity source .    to better evaluate these possibilities",
    "we need stellar population information for the galaxy out to at least one effective radius .",
    "this will provide an age , metallicity and @xmath4element abundance ratio for the assumed old ( @xmath2210 gyr ) underlying population . with this information",
    "the next step would be to apply a chemo - gas code in an attempt to reproduce the observed properties .    in terms of the gc formation models described in the introduction ,",
    "the detection of old red and blue gc sub - populations in ngc  1052 is generally consistent with the predictions of both forbes ( 1997 ) and cote ( 1998 ) .",
    "the ages are not yet accurate enough to determine whether the red gcs are a few gyr younger than the blue ones as expected in forbes ( 1997 ) . on the other hand",
    ", we find no evidence for gcs forming in the merger event , in contrast to the expectations of the merger model of ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) .",
    "there are now several examples of galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed _ minor _ contributions to their gc systems from recently formed gcs , while the vast bulk of their gcs appear to be very old .",
    "ngc 1399 , a central cluster galaxy which is old and has no photometric indication of intermediate - age gcs , may have a small number of @xmath192 gyr old gcs ( forbes 2001a ) .",
    "photometry of gcs in the merger remnant ngc 3610 , which has a spectroscopic age of 1.6@xmath140.5 gyrs ( denicolo 2005 ) , suggested the presence of an intermediate - age sub - population ( whitmore 2002 ) .",
    "however , spectroscopy of some of these candidate intermediate - age gcs indicates that only a small portion of these clusters are in fact @xmath192 gyr old ( strader 2004 ) .",
    "perhaps the best example of intermediate - age gcs in a merger remnant is ngc  1316 , it has a similar age ( @xmath193 gyrs ) and lies at a similar distance ( 22.9 mpc ) to ngc  1052 ( goudfrooij 2001 ) .",
    "figure [ disc1316 ] shows a comparison of the colour magnitude diagrams for the spectroscopically confirmed gcs of these two galaxies . only the 3 brightest ngc  1316 gcs had high enough s / n to measure ages , and these are 2 magnitudes brighter in v than the brightest gcs for which we obtained spectra in ngc  1052 .",
    "all three gcs were found to be @xmath193 gyrs old and solar metallicity ( goudfrooij 2001 ) .",
    "the ngc  1316 gc colour distribution peaks at b ",
    "i@xmath191.8 , which lies between the peaks of the ngc  1052 gc colour distribution .",
    "there is no significant population of ngc  1052 gcs in the same colour and magnitude parameter space as the young ngc  1316 gcs .",
    "therefore we do not expect a similar sub - population of @xmath333 gyr gcs in ngc  1052 .",
    "we have obtained low - resolution spectra for 19 globular cluster ( gc ) candidates associated with the merger remnant elliptical ngc  1052 . of this sample ,",
    "16 are identified as @xmath34 gcs by their radial velocities . using these velocities",
    ", we derive a virial mass of 1.7@xmath140.9 x 10@xmath35 within a radius of @xmath196.5 r@xmath26 ( 19 kpc ) . if the orbits had a strong tangental bias then our tracer mass estimate would be 30% too large .    using the multi - index @xmath7 fitting technique of proctor & sansom ( 2002 ) , and the simple stellar population models of thomas , maraston & korn ( 2004 ) we derive individual ages , metallicities and abundance ratios for the 16 confirmed gcs .",
    "we find all of the gcs to be very old , i.e. @xmath36 gyr , with a range of metallicities .",
    "the predicted colours , based on the derived ages and metallicities , agree well with the observed gc colours .",
    "we find no evidence for young gcs associated with the likely minor merger event @xmath191 gyr ago .",
    "we also obtained a long - slit spectrum covering the central @xmath37  of ngc  1052 .",
    "no strong gradient in either age or metallicity was found .",
    "however , a large abundance ratio gradient exists .",
    "the stellar population in the central regions of ngc  1052 has a luminosity - weighted age of @xmath1 gyr with [ fe / h]@xmath2 and a very high @xmath4element abundance ratio of @xmath19 + 0.8 dex .",
    "the recent central star formation episode was most likely induced by infalling gas associated with the recent merger .",
    "thus , although ngc  1052 shows substantial evidence for a recent merger and an associated starburst , it appears that the merger did not induce the formation of many , if any , new gcs . as the formation of luminous star clusters appears to accompany most significant star formation events ,",
    "the absence of young gcs and the high [ e / fe ] values in the center of the galaxy ( suggesting short star formation timescales ) may indicate that a relatively small amount of star formation occurred in the merger .",
