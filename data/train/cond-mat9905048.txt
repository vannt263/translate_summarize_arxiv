    "experimental realisations of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in ultracold and dilute atomic gases @xcite generated extensive theoretical studies of the macroscopic dynamics of condensed atomic clouds ( see , e.g. , ref . 3 and references therein ) . in experiments ,",
    "the bec atoms are trapped in a three - dimensional , generally anisotropic , external potential created by a magnetic trap , and their collective dynamics can be described by the well - known gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation ,    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the macroscopic wave function of a condensate in the @xmath3-dimensional space , @xmath4 is a parabolic trapping potential , and the parameter @xmath5 characterises the two - particle interaction proportional to the s - wave scaterring length @xmath6 . when @xmath7 , the interaction between the particles in the condensate is repulsive , as in most current experiments @xcite , whereas for @xmath8 the interaction is attractive @xcite .    from the viewpoint of the nonlinear dynamics of solitary waves ,",
    "the case of the negative scattering length is the most interesting one .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ gpeq ] ) without a parabolic potential display collapse for both @xmath9 and @xmath10 , so that _ no stable spatially localised solutions exist in those dimensions at all_. a trapping potential allows a stabilisation of otherwise unstable and collapsing solutions and , as has been already shown for the 3d case with the help of different approximate techniques @xcite , there exists a critical number @xmath11 of the total condensate particles @xmath12 , defined through the normalisation of the condensate wavefunction as @xmath13 such that the condensate is stable for @xmath14 , and it becomes unstable for @xmath15 , and then its local density @xmath16 grows to infinity .",
    "this critical value of the particles number is readily observed in experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyse systematically , in the framework of the gp equation ( [ gpeq ] ) , the structure and stability of a trapped condensate depending on its dimension @xmath3 . in spite of the fact that the first experimental results were obtained for the bec in a 3d anisotropic trap , the cases of lower dimensions are also of great importance and , moreover",
    ", they have a clear physical motivation .",
    "first of all , eq . ( [ gpeq ] ) with @xmath17 appears as the fundamental model of bec in highly anisotropic traps of the axial symmetry @xmath18 provided @xmath19 , i.e. for _ cigar - shaped traps_. in this case , the transverse structure of the condensate is controlled by a trapping potential , and it can be described by the eigenmodes of a two - dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator . then , after averaging over the cross - section , eq .",
    "( [ gpeq ] ) appears as a 1d model with renormalised parameters , and it describes the longitudinal dynamics of the condensate ( see ref . 6 and sec . 2 below ) .",
    "secondly , in the case @xmath9 , the model ( [ gpeq ] ) can be employed to describe the condensate dynamics in the so - called _ pancake traps _ ( @xmath20 ) , and it can be related to recent experiments with quasi - two - dimensional condensates or coherent atomic systems @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we consider the 1d case and find numerically the ground - state solutions for the trapped condensate in both @xmath8 and @xmath7 cases . in the former case ,",
    "the problem is found to be remarkably similar to that of the soliton propagation in optical fibers in the presence of the dispersion management @xcite",
    ". the most interesting case of a 2d trap is considered in sec .",
    "3 , where we discuss the necessary conditions for the instability of the radially symmetric condensate in a trap , and also analyse the invariants of the stationary solutions found numerically .",
    "we point out , for the first time to our knowledge , that 2d condensates can be stable , in spite of the possibility of collapse in the model described by the 2d gp equation .",
    "similar results are briefly presented in sec . 4 for the 3d becs of radial symmetry , and they provide a rigorous background for the variational results obtained earlier by different methods @xcite .",
    "in all the cases , we also find the condensate structure for the positive scattering length where the instability is absent in all the dimensions .",
    "to derive the 1d gp equation from eq .",
    "( [ gpeq ] ) , we assume that the parabolic potential @xmath4 describes a cigar - shaped trap . for the potential ( [ veq ] ) , this means that @xmath21 , and the transverse structure of the condensate , being close to a gaussian in shape , is mostly defined by the trapping potential .",
    "we are interested in the stationary solutions of the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 has the meaning of the chemical potential .",
    "measuring the spatial variables in the units of the longitudinal harmonic oscillator length @xmath24 , and the wavefunction , in units of @xmath25 , we obtain the following stationary dimensionless equation : @xmath26\\phi + \\sigma|\\phi|^{2}\\phi = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and the sign @xmath29 in front of the nonlinear term is defined by the sign of the s - wave scattering length of two - body interaction .",
    "we assume that in eq .",
    "( [ gpeq ] ) the nonlinear interaction is weak relative to the trapping potential force , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "then , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ phieq ] ) that the transverse structure of the condensate is of order of @xmath31 , and the condensate has a cigar - like shape .",
    "therefore , we can look for solutions of eq .",
    "( [ phieq ] ) in the form , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is a solution of the auxiliary problem for the 2d quantum harmonic oscillator @xmath35 which we take in the form of the no - node ground state , @xmath36 @xmath37 being constant . to preserve all the information about the 3d condensate in an asymmetric trap describing its properties by the 1d gp equation for the longitudinal profile",
    ", we impose the normalisation , @xmath38 that yields @xmath39 .    after substituting the solution ( [ divide ] ) with the function ( [ phi_eq ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ phieq ] ) , dividing by @xmath34 and integrating over the transverse cross - section @xmath40 of the cigar - shaped condensate , we finally obtain the following 1d stationary gp equation ( see also the similar results in ref .",
    "6 ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and the normalisation ( [ normal ] ) for @xmath43 is used .",
    "importantly , the number of the condensate particles @xmath12 is now defined as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the integral of motion for the normalised nonstationary gp equation .      equation ( [ gpeq_1 ] ) includes all the terms of the same order , and it describes the longitudinal profile of the condensate state in an anisotropic trap . in the linear limit ,",
    "i.e. when formally @xmath46 , eq .",
    "( [ gpeq_1 ] ) becomes the well - known equation for a harmonic quantum oscillator .",
    "its localised solutions exist only for @xmath47 , and they are defined through the gauss - hermite polynomials , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 so that @xmath50 , @xmath51 , etc .    to describe the effect of weak nonlinearity , we can employ a perturbation theory based on the expansion of the general solution of eq .",

    "( [ hermite ] ) .",
    "the similar approach has been used earlier in the theory of the dispersion - managed optical solitons ( see , e.g. , ref . 10 ) , and it allows us to describe the effect of weak interaction on the condensate structure and stability .",
    "these results will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    in the opposite limit ,",
    "i.e. when the nonlinear term is much larger than the parabolic potential , localised solutions exist only for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and they are described by the stationary nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation .",
    "the one - soliton solution is @xmath54 so that @xmath55 coincides with the soliton invariant .    in general , the ground - state solution of eq .",

    "( [ gpeq_1 ] ) for several values of the dimensionless parameter @xmath56 , for both negative ( a ) and positive ( b ) scattering length . for @xmath57 , i.e. in the limit of the harmonic oscillator mode , the solution is close to gaussian for both the cases .",
    "when @xmath56 deviates from 1 , the solution profile is defined by the type of nonlinearity . for attraction ( @xmath53 ) , the profile approaches the sech - type soliton ( [ nls_1 ] ) , whereas for repulsion ( @xmath58 ) the solution flattens , cf .",

    "1(b ) .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the dependence of the invariant @xmath59 on the parameter @xmath56 , for both the families of localised solutions , corresponding to two different signs of the scattering length . the dotted line shows the limit of the soliton solution of the nls equation without a trapping potential . in the asymptotic ,",
    "i.e. say for @xmath60 , the curve @xmath61 coincides with the invariant @xmath59 for the bec condensate in a trap .",
    "this means that for such localised condensates the effect of the trap is negligible and the condensate function becomes localised mostly due to an attractive interparticle interaction .    to discuss the stability of localised solutions , we refer to a number of the corresponding problems well analysed in nonlinear optics of guided modes and solitary waves @xcite . in terms of the so - called vakhitov - kolokolov stability criterion , the condition @xmath62 gives the solution stability for the case @xmath53",
    "therefore , all 1d solitons for the attraction case are stable .",
    "a detailed discussion of the soliton stability for this case can be found in ref .",
    "formally , the case @xmath58 corresponds to the opposite sign of the derivative @xmath63 .",
    "however , this case of the so - called defocusing nonlinearity is also well - known in nonlinear optics of guided waves , and it has been analysed for different types of the trapping potential .",
    "in particular , it is known that the vakhitov - kolokolov criterion does not apply to this case , and all the family of spatially localised solutions are stable @xcite .",
    "extension of all those results to the case of a parabolic trap is a straightforward technical problem .",
    "it is well known that in the linear limit @xmath46 , eq .",
    "( [ gpeq_1 ] ) possesses a _ discrete set of localised modes _ corresponding to the different orders of the gauss - hermite polynomials .",
    "we demonstrate that all those modes can be readily obtained for the nonlinear problem as well , giving a continuation of the gauss - hermite modes to a nonlinear regime .",
    "figure 3 shows several examples of those modes for both negative ( @xmath53 ) and positive ( @xmath58 ) scattering length , respectively . in the limit @xmath64 ,",
    "those modes are defined by the eigenfunctions of the linear harmonic oscillator .",
    "the effect of nonlinearity is different for the negative and positive scattering length . for the negative scattering length ( attraction ) , the higher - order modes transform into multi - soliton states consisting of a sequence of solitary waves with alternating phases [ see figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) ] .",
    "this is further confirmed by the analysis of the invariant @xmath59 vs. @xmath56 , where all the branches of the higher - order modes tend asymptotically to the soliton dependences @xmath65 , where @xmath12 is the order of the mode ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "examples of the dependences @xmath67 for the first- and second - order modes are shown in fig .",
    "4 . from the physical point of view ,",
    "the higher - order modes in the case of attractive interaction correspond to a balance between _ repulsion _ of out - of - phase bright solitons and _ attraction _ of the trapping potential .",
    "it is clear that such a balance can be easily destroyed by , for example , making the soliton amplitudes different .",
    "however , the analysis of the stability of such higher - order multi - soliton modes is beyond the scope of this paper .    for the positive scattering length ( @xmath58 ) ,",
    "the higher - order modes transform into a sequence of dark solitons @xcite , so that the first - order mode corresponds to a single dark soliton , the second - order mode to a pair of dark solitons , etc .",
    "[ see figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) ] .",
    "again , these stationary solutions satisfy the force balance condition - repulsion between dark solitons is exactly compensated by an attractive force of the trapping potential .",
    "the case of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) gp equation can be associated with a quasi - condensate of atomic hydrogen @xcite or quasi-2d gas of laser cooled atoms @xcite .",
    "derivation of the gp equation from the first principles of scattering theory in the two - dimensional geometry is not trivial , and it has been recently shown @xcite that the correct form of the 2d gp equation ( [ gpeq ] ) should have the 2d interaction potential @xmath68 in the form @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , @xmath6 is the scattering length , and the characteristic wavenumber @xmath71 can be approximated as @xmath72 . here , we derive the 2d gp equation directly from its 3d form of eq .",
    "( [ gpeq ] ) , for the case of a pancake trap when @xmath73 .    in the case of a pancake trap , in the parabolic potential ( [ veq ] )",
    "we assume the parameter @xmath31 is large , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "then , the longitudinal profile of the condensate is controlled by the parabolic potential @xmath74 .",
    "measuring the spatial variables in the units of the transverse harmonic oscillator length @xmath75 and the wavefunction in units of @xmath76 , from eq .",

    "is squeezed in the @xmath79-direction and its size in this direction is of the order of @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , we can look for stationary solutions in the form , @xmath81 where @xmath82 depends on the radial coordinate @xmath83 , and this time the function @xmath84 is a solution of the 1d quantum harmonic oscillator , @xmath85 with the gaussian form , @xmath86 normalisation condition @xmath87 yields @xmath88 .    substituting the solution ( [ divide_2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ phieq_2 ] ) and averaging over @xmath89 , we obtain the following 2d equation for @xmath82 , @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 . equation ( [ gpeq_2 ] ) is the 2d gp equation for the stationary solutions without any angular dependence . in the linear limit ,",
    "i.e. when we neglect the nonlinear term ( @xmath46 ) , the solution exists only at @xmath93 , and it can be written in the form @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is defined by normalisation . in the opposite limit , the localised solution exists only for @xmath96 , and it is described by the radially symmetric solitary wave of the 2d nls equation .",
    "we integrate eq .",
    "( [ gpeq_2 ] ) numerically and find a family of radially symmetric localised solutions @xmath82 for the condensate ground state , for both @xmath53 ( attraction ) and @xmath58 ( repulsion ) .",
    "some results are presented in figs .",
    "5(a , b ) , for different values of the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "the structure of the localised solutions is similar to those in the 1d case .",
    "however , in the limit of large negative @xmath56 , the solution transforms into the 2d nls soliton , known to be a self - similar radially symmetric solution corresponding to a critical collapse .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , where we present the dependence of the invariant @xmath59 on the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "the 2d nls soliton exists only for @xmath97 and @xmath96 , and it corresponds to the fixed value of the invariant , @xmath98 , shown as a dotted straight line in fig . 6 .",
    "stability of the 2d condensates in a parabolic trap is an important issue . in particular , as was shown by berg @xcite and tsurumi and wadati @xcite , the presence of a trapping potential does not remove collapse from the 2d gp equation .",
    "this result is very much expected because it has been known for a long time that , in the case of the 2d nls equation with a parabolic potential , there exists an exact analytical transformation that allows the potential to be removed from the 2d nls equation @xcite .",
    "this means that for some classes of the input conditions of the gp equation , the collapse should be observed even in the presence of a trapping potential . nevertheless , as follows from our results summarised in fig .",
    "6 , for the attractive case ( @xmath53 ) the derivative @xmath99 is positive and it does not change the sign . moreover , according to the collapse conditions derived in ref .",
    "15 , for the radius @xmath100 of the time - dependent 2d condensate the following equation holds @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the system hamiltonian @xmath103 and @xmath100 is defined as @xmath104 equation ( [ eq_r ] ) means that the condition @xmath105 is a sufficient condition for collapse , because the value @xmath106 surely becomes negative for some value of @xmath107 and , therefore , the wavefunction becomes singular and collapses as @xmath108 tends to zero .",
    "when @xmath102 is zero or positive , the dynamics depend on the applied perturbation , so that for a large enough perturbation we can lower the stationary value of the hamiltonian @xmath102 . in fig",
    "7 we present the dependences @xmath109 and @xmath110 for the family of stationary solutions found numerically for the attraction case @xmath53 .",
    "it is clear that the whole family of stationary solutions corresponds to @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the ground - state is expected to be stable everywhere , but its dynamics should be sensitive to the perturbation amplitude for larger @xmath56 since a perturbation can make the hamiltonian negative .",
    "this statement should be further verified by numerical simulations of the 2d gp equation .",
    "similar to the 1d case discussed above , the higher - order modes of a harmonic oscillator can be found in the 2d case too , thus providing an analytical continuation of the 2d gauss - hermite modes .",
    "the set of such solutions is broader because it includes a continuation of a superposition of different modes .",
    "for example , the mode @xmath112 is the fundamental ground - state solution , that continues the zero - order gauss - hermite mode @xmath113 , as discussed above . in general , the modes @xmath114 have no radial symmetry and they include both dipole - like and vortex - like states .",
    "the simplest higher - order radially symmetric mode describes the condensate with a single vortex , shown in fig .",
    "8 . figures 8(a ) and 8(b ) show the density profile of the condensate with a vortex state , for both negative ( @xmath53 ) and positive ( @xmath58 ) scattering length , respectively .",
    "figure 8(c ) presents the dependence of the invariant @xmath59 vs. @xmath56 for the vortex state in comparison with the ground - state mode . because the vortex state is a nonlinear mode that extends the corresponding mode of the linear system , it approaches the value @xmath115 .",
    "the case of a radially symmetric 3d trap is the most studied in the literature , so that the corresponding results are well known , and therefore we reproduce some of them just for the completeness of the general picture of the stationary states .",
    "similar results for the stationary states can be found , e.g. in refs . 3 and 17 , whereas the bec stability has been recently discussed by huepe _",
    "et al_. @xcite",
    ".    figures 9(a ) and 9(b ) show the density profiles of the 3d condensate of radial symmetry for different values of @xmath56 , for both negative ( @xmath53 ) and positive ( @xmath58 ) scattering length . while in the case of repulsion ( @xmath58 )",
    ", the condensate broadens for larger @xmath56 remaining always stable , for the attractive interparticle interaction ( @xmath53 ) , the condensate is stable only for @xmath116 , where @xmath117 corresponds to the maximum value @xmath118 [ see fig . 10 ] .",
    "this result is consistent with the vakhitov - kolokolov stability criterion @xmath62 .",
    "the critical value @xmath119 corresponds to a critical value of the particles @xmath11 and it has been already observed in experiment @xcite . without the trapping potential i.e. in the limit of the 3d nls equation ,",
    "all localised solutions for @xmath53 are unstable ( shown as a dotted curve in fig .",
    "we have presented a systematic study of the ground - state and higher - order spatially localised solutions of the gp equation for the bose - einstein condensates in a parabolic trap of different dimensions .",
    "while many results for the radially symmetric ground - state and vortex modes in 3d are available in the literature for the condensates with the positive scattering length ( i.e. , for repulsive interaction of the condensate atoms ) , little is known for the condensates with the negative scattering length , especially for the 2d traps . in particular , we have presented the results indicating that , in spite of the collapse condition in the 2d case , the family of 2d localised solutions of the gp equation can be stable .",
    "additionally , we have clarified the meaning of higher - order localised modes , i.e. _ nonlinear gauss - hermite eigenmodes _ , and demonstrated their link to multi - soliton states .",
