    "the observable which i am interested in is the _",
    "cronin ratio _ , @xmath1 , of the inclusive differential cross - sections for proton scattering on two different targets , normalized to the respective atomic numbers @xmath2 and @xmath3 : @xmath4 in absence of nuclear effects one would expect @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 , but for a@xmath8b a suppression is observed experimentally at small @xmath9 , and an enhancement at moderate @xmath9 with @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "this behaviour may be charachterized by the value of three parameters : the transverse momentum @xmath12 at which @xmath1 crosses unity and the transverse momentum @xmath13 at which @xmath1 reaches its maximum value @xmath14@xmath6@xmath15 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cronineffect ] . these _ cronin parameters _",
    "will be studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : predictions ]    the cronin effect has received renewed interest after the experimental discovery at rhic of an unexpectedly small @xmath16 in au - au collisions at @xmath17@xmath6@xmath18 gev compared to @xmath19 collisions at the same energy @xcite .",
    "this fact has been proposed as an experimental signature of a large jet quenching suggesting that a quark - gluon plasma was created during the collision @xcite .",
    "however , the extrapolation to rhic and lhc energies of the known cronin effect at lower energies is haunted by large theoretical uncertainties , which may make unreliable any interpretation of signals of this kind .",
    "some light will be shed on this problem by the upcoming rhic data on @xmath20 collisions at @xmath17@xmath6@xmath21 gev .    since in @xmath0 collisions",
    "no hot and dense medium is expected to be created , a @xmath0 run at the same nucleon - nucleon energy as in nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath22 ) collisions would be of major importance to test the theoretical models and to have reliable baseline spectra for the extraction of novel physical effects .",
    "a further advantage of @xmath0 collisions , is that the multiplicity of particles in the final state is relatively small compared to @xmath22 collisions .",
    "for this reason at alice minijets may be observed at transverse momenta larger than 5 gev ( see section on  the experimental parameters for pa at the lhc \" in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as i will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : predictions ] , this may allow the use of the cronin effect on minijet production as a further check of the models .",
    "soon after the discovery of the cronin effect @xcite , it was realized that the observed nuclear enhancement of the @xmath23-spectra could be explained in terms of multiple interactions @xcite .",
    "the models may be classified    r5.3 cm    -.4 cm   -.3 cm    -.7 cm    according to the physical object which is undergoing rescatterings ( the projectile hadron or its partons ) , and to the `` hardness '' of the rescattering processes taken into account .",
    "note that a parton is commonly said to undergo a hard scattering if the exchanged momentum is of the order or greater than approximately 1 gev .",
    "however , physically there is no sharp distinction between soft and hard momentum transfer .",
    "therefore , i prefer to make reference to the so - called two component models of hadron transverse spectra , and call hard a scattering which is described by a power - law differential cross - section at large @xmath23 , and soft a scattering whose cross - section is decreasing faster than any inverse power of the transverse momentum at large @xmath23 . in tables  [ tab : hadronic ] and [ tab : partonic ] i provide a quick comparison of the hadronic and partonic rescattering models , respectively .",
    "these models are based on the pqcd collinearly factorized cross - section for inclusive particle production in @xmath19 collisions . in order to describe the large-@xmath9 tail of transverse momentum spectra",
    ", one has to include also an intrinsic transverse momentum for the colliding parton .",
    "the collision of a proton on a nuclear target of atomic number @xmath2 is then obtained in a glauber - type model as follows : @xmath24 where the proton and nucleus parton distribution functions are , respectively , @xmath25 in eq .",

    "@xmath29 are the parton distribution functions of the proton ( nucleus ) ; isospin imbalance is taken into account and nuclear shadowing is included by the hijing parametrization @xcite .",
    "partons are assumed to have an intrinsic transverse momentum with average squared value @xmath30 and a gaussian distribution . due to the @xmath31 and @xmath32 integrations",
    "a regulator mass @xmath33@xmath6@xmath34 gev has been used in the pqcd cross - section . finally , @xmath35 are the fragmentation functions of a parton @xmath36 into a hadron @xmath37 with a fraction @xmath38 of the parton momentum .",
    "soft proton - nucleon interactions are assumed to excite the projectile proton s wavefunction , so that when the proton interacts with the next target nucleon its partons have a broadened intrinsic momentum .",
    "each rescattering of the proton is assumed to contribute to the intrinsic momentum broadening in the same way , so that : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the proton intrinsic momentum needed to describe hadron transverse spectra in @xmath19 collisions , @xmath41 is the average momentum squared acquired in each rescattering , and @xmath42 represent the average number of collisions which are effective in broadening the intrinsic momentum .",
