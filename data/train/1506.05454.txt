    "now , observers with constant @xmath103 are inertial observers for the empty interior metric and these observers rotate with respect to ads infinity with @xmath22 .",
    "let us call the angular velocity of the interior observers as @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",

    "the rotating effect on the inside region relative to infinity caused by the presence of a rotating shell as an example of the dragging of inertial frames effect is well known in 3 + 1 general relativity , see e.g. @xcite@xmath0 .",
    "we see that in 2 + 1 dimensions this phenomenon also occurs .",
    "in eq .  ( [ constraint1 ] ) we have imposed that the shell s radius is always larger than the gravitational radius , @xmath128 .",
    "we discuss here the weak and the dominant energy conditions .",
    "the weak energy condition is automatically satisfied since we have @xmath45 and @xmath46 non - negative .",
    "the dominant energy condition can be discussed in the the frame that detects the matter as a perfect fluid , where the quantities @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the relevant ones . in this frame",
    "the dominant energy condition states that @xmath129 from eqs .",

    "( [ menergy ] ) one has that for large @xmath11 that @xmath134 .",

    "for @xmath53 constant the matter disappears in the @xmath138 limit .",
    "however , it can be the case that @xmath53 grows proportional to @xmath11 , so that @xmath82 is constant . in this case",
    "the limit @xmath138 is also well defined and the shell obeys the dominant energy condition since @xmath139 .",
    "second , eq .  ( [ dom2 ] ) is satisfied when @xmath68 ( or @xmath63 ) , i.e. , the outer btz spacetime is extremal and the observers that see a perfect fluid are rotating at the extremality limit , i.e. , at the speed of light , @xmath140 , see eq .",
    "( [ 4omega ] ) . in this case , for these observers the matter in the shell becomes massless as expected and so @xmath141 as one can check from eq .",
    "( [ lambdaperf ] ) .",
    "now , the pressure for these observer also vanish , see eq .",
    "( [ pressurebtz ] ) . this can be interpreted considering that the ads attraction due to the negative cosmological constant is now purely balanced by some kind of centrifugal force due to this maximum rotating speed , making the pressure going to zero . in the limit one has @xmath137 and so the dominant energy conditon is satisfied for any @xmath11 . for all other settings",
    "the dominant energy condition is violated .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spacetime is ads , with a negative cosmological constant , which as seen as a perfect fluid does not obey the dominan energy condition .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of a rotating thin matter ring shell in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the outside metric is the btz metric , asymptotically ads , and the inside metric is the empty spacetime metric with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "we obtained the shell s rest energy density , the pressure and angular momentu flux density by using the junction conditions .",
    "due to rotation , the shell s energy - momentum tensor was not in the form of a perfect fluid .",
    "we then attempted to write the energy - momentum tensor in a perfect fluid form and obtained the thin shell s energy density , pressure and angular velocity for the frame where one sees the thin shell as a perfect fluid with no angular momentum flux .",
    "we have found that machian effects occur in 2 + 1 dimensions and that frame dragging is present in these spacetimes .",
    "we analyzed the weak and dominant energy conditions of the system .",
    "the dominant energy condition implies that there are only two valid configurations : the @xmath138 case with its subcases , the trivial @xmath142 shell and the nontrivial @xmath143 shell , and the extremal case @xmath144 ( or @xmath63 ) .",
    "here we derive properties of the matter in a frame that sees it as a perfect fluid .",
    "the intrinsic metric on the shell is given by @xmath145 in the rest frame of the shell , the energy - momentum tensor @xmath78 is given by @xmath146 now the metric on the shell , eq .",
