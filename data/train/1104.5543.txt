    "rivin @xcite and kowalski @xcite showed that the probability that a random walk on the mapping class group gives rise to a pseudo - anosov element tends to one , as long as the group generated by the support of the mapping class group maps onto a sufficiently large subgroup of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , they showed that the probability that an element is _ not _ pseudo - anosov decays exponentially in the length of the random walk .",
    "malestein and souto @xcite and lubotzky and meiri @xcite extended this to the torelli subgroup , by considering the action of the torelli group on the homology of double covers of the surface .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the probability that a random walk gives a element tends to one for all non - elementary subgroups of the mapping class , by considering the action of the mapping class group on the complex of curves , but no information was obtained about the rate of convergence . in this paper",
    "we show that the rate of convergence is exponential ; in fact , we show that for any constant @xmath9 , the probability that a random walk gives an element of translation length at most @xmath9 on the complex of curves decays exponentially in the length of the random walk ; the rate of decay depends on @xmath9 .",
    "we say the surface @xmath1 is _ sporadic _ if @xmath1 is a sphere with at most four punctures , or a torus with at most one puncture .",

    "then for any constant @xmath17 , there is a constant @xmath18 such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the translation length of @xmath5 acting on the complex of curves .    if the surface is sporadic , then the mapping class group is either finite , or commensurable to @xmath21 , and in the latter case the result follows from the work of rivin @xcite or kowalski @xcite on random walks on matrix groups .",
    "theorem [ theorem : main ] does not apply to the torelli group of the genus two surface , as this group is not finitely generated , as shown by mccullough and miller @xcite .",
    "however , the results of @xcite hold in this case , but with no rate of convergence information .",
    "there are two main steps , both of which use the improper metric on @xmath2 arising from its action on the complex of curves , which we shall denote by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a basepoint in the complex of curves @xmath10 ; this is also known as a relative metric on @xmath2 .",
    "the first is to show that the random walk has a linear rate of escape in the relative metric , with exponential decay for the proportion of sample paths making progress at lower rate .",
    "the second is to consider the distribution of elements of bounded translation length on the complex of curves .",
    "if @xmath24 is an element of bounded translation length on the complex of curves , then @xmath24 is conjugate to an element @xmath25 , of bounded relative length .",

    "finally , in section [ section : translation length ] we show that the fellow travelling property described above is equivalent to the condition that the pair @xmath30 lies in a certain neighbourhood of the diagonal in @xmath31 , consisting of unions of shadows , and we show that the probability that a random walk lies in one of these neighbourhoods decays exponentially in the length of @xmath5 .",
    "we will consider the action of the mapping class group on the complex of curves , see farb and margalit @xcite for an introduction to the mapping class group .",
    "the complex of curves @xmath10 is a simplicial complex , whose vertices are isotopy classes of simple closed curves , and whose simplices are spanned by disjoint simple closed curves .",
    "the complex of curves is finite dimensional , but not locally finite .",
    "we will only need to consider distances between vertices in the curve complex , and so we consider the @xmath28-skeleton of the complex of curves to be a metric space @xmath32 , by assigning every edge to have length @xmath28 . by abuse of notation",
    ", we will refer to this as a metric on the curve complex .",
    "the mapping class group acts on the complex of curves by simplicial isometries , and a choice of basepoint @xmath23 in the complex of curves determines a map from @xmath2 to @xmath10 defined by @xmath33 .",
    "we may therefore define an improper metric on the mapping class group by @xmath34 we emphasize that throughout this paper the metric @xmath35 will always refer to this improper metric induced from the action of the mapping class group on the complex of curves , and never a proper word metric on @xmath2 with respect to a finite generating set .",
    "however , the metric @xmath35 is quasi - isometric to a word metric on @xmath2 with respect to an infinite generating set , also known as a _ relative metric _ , formed by starting with a finite generating set and adding subgroups which stabilize vertices in the complex of curves which correspond to distinct orbits under the action of the mapping class group .",
    "masur and minsky @xcite showed that the curve complex is gromov hyperbolic , and we will write @xmath36 for the gromov boundary of @xmath2 , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .    a random walk of length @xmath6 on @xmath2 is a product of @xmath6 independent identically @xmath3-distributed random variables @xmath39 , which we shall call the _ steps _ of the random walk , so @xmath40 , and @xmath5 is distributed as @xmath41 , the @xmath6-fold convolution of @xmath3 with itself .",
    "a random walk converges to the gromov boundary almost surely , so this gives a hitting measure , known as _ harmonic measure _ on @xmath36 , and which we shall denote by @xmath42 .",
    "we will need to estimate the probability that a random walk lies in particular subsets of @xmath37 .",
    "we now define a family of subsets of @xmath37 which we shall call _ shadows_. recall that the gromov product of @xmath16 and @xmath43 with respect to @xmath28 is equal to the distance from @xmath28 to a geodesic from @xmath16 to @xmath43 , up to a bounded error which only depends on @xmath44 . given a real number @xmath45 , we can use the gromov product to define the shadow of a point @xmath16 in @xmath2 , which we shall denote by @xmath46 , @xmath47    we warn the reader that we use a different parameterization of shadows than that used by other authors , for example , blachre , hassinsky , and mathieu , @xcite define their shadows @xmath48 to be @xmath49 in our notation .",
    "we show that both the harmonic measures of shadows , and the @xmath41-measures of shadows , decay exponentially in @xmath45 , i.e. there are constants @xmath50 and @xmath18 such that @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for all @xmath16 , @xmath45 and @xmath6 .    in @xcite",
    ", we showed that a random walk makes linear progress in the relative metric , almost surely , i.e. there is a constant @xmath53 such that @xmath54 we need a stronger version of this result , which gives an exponential decay bound for the rate of convergence . to be precise , we show :    [ theorem : exponential linear progress ] let @xmath2 be the mapping class group of a non - sporadic surface of finite type , and let @xmath5 be a random walk of length @xmath6 on @xmath2 , generated by a finitely supported probability distribution @xmath3 , whose support generates a non - elementary subgroup of the mapping class group .",
    "then there are constants @xmath55 and @xmath18 , such that @xmath56 where @xmath35 is the non - proper metric on the mapping class group arising from its action on the complex of curves .",
    "we now give a brief overview of the proof of theorem [ theorem : exponential linear progress ] .",
    "consider taking the random walk @xmath57 steps at a time , i.e. consider @xmath58 instead of @xmath5 , which we shall refer to as the @xmath57-iterated random walk .",
    "we shall write @xmath59 for @xmath58 , and the steps of the @xmath57-iterated random walk are given by @xmath60 .",
    "the increments of the walk , @xmath61 , are all independent and identically distributed , with distribution @xmath62 .",
    "however , the distance travelled at time @xmath63 , given by @xmath64 is not the sum of the distances travelled at each step of the @xmath57-iterated walk , @xmath65 , as there may be some `` backtracking '' , illustrated schematically in figure [ pic : backtracks ] .",
    "the distance @xmath66 is the sum of the @xmath67 for @xmath68 , minus the total amount of backtracking .",
    "a key fact is that the distribution of the amount of backtracking at time @xmath69 is bounded above by an exponential function , and furthermore , the same upper bound holds for all @xmath69 , independent of the locations of the random walk , or the amount of backtracking at other times , and also independent of @xmath57 , the number of steps for each segment of the @xmath57-iterated random walk .",
    "we now explain why this is the case .",
    "the amount of backtracking can be estimated as follows .",
    "the size of the backtrack from @xmath70 to @xmath71 is roughly the distance from @xmath70 to the geodesic from @xmath28 to @xmath71 .",
    "after applying the isometry @xmath70 , this is the same as the distance from @xmath28 to the geodesic from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , as illustrated in figure [ pic : increment ] .",
    "the point @xmath73 is equal to @xmath74 , and the pair of random variables @xmath75 are independent , and distributed as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the @xmath6-fold convolution of the reflected distribution @xmath78 .",
    "if the backtrack is of length at least @xmath45 , then distance from @xmath28 to a geodesic from @xmath72 to @xmath74 is at least @xmath45 , up to bounded error , so in turn the gromov product @xmath79 is at least @xmath45 up to bounded error .",
    "therefore @xmath80 lies in @xmath81 , for some @xmath50 which only depends on @xmath44 .",
    "we show that both the harmonic measure @xmath42 , and the convolution measures @xmath82 , of shadows @xmath46 are bounded above by a function which decays exponentially in @xmath45 , and furthermore , the upper bound function is independent of both @xmath16 and @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the probability that there is a backtrack of size @xmath45 decays exponentially in @xmath45 , independently of @xmath57 , and also independently of the locations of the random walk at other times .",
    "in particular , the expected size of a backtrack is bounded independently of @xmath57 , so by choosing @xmath57 sufficiently large , we can ensure that the expected value of each @xmath57-iterated step @xmath67 is larger than the expected value of a backtrack . furthermore , applying standard bernstein or chernoff - hoeffding estimates for concentration of measures , we obtain bounds for the probability that the sums of the first @xmath6 backtracks and @xmath57-iterated steps deviate from their expected values , and these bounds decay exponentially in @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that the distance away from the origin grows linearly at some rate , with exponential decay for the proportion of paths making progress below this rate .",
    "we now wish to show that the probability that @xmath5 is tends to @xmath28 exponentially quickly .",
    "the translation length of a group element on the complex of curves is @xmath83 masur and minsky @xcite showed that the elements are precisely those elements with non - zero translation length .",
    "the translation length of an element @xmath24 acting on the complex of curves is also coarsely equivalent to the shortest length of any conjugate of @xmath24 , measured in the relative metric on the mapping class group . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the has _ relative conjugacy bounds _",
    ", i.e. there is a constant @xmath50 such that if two group elements @xmath84 and @xmath85 are conjugate , then @xmath86 for some element @xmath26 whose length is bounded in terms of the lengths of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath87 we emphasize that the distance @xmath35 here is the relative or curve complex distance on the mapping class group . every group element @xmath24 corresponds to a point in @xmath2 , but we may also think of @xmath24 as representing some choice of geodesic from @xmath28 to @xmath24 .",
    "we may therefore think of a product of group elements as representing a path in @xmath2 , composed of concatenating various translates of geodesics representing each element in the product .",
    "in particular , the word @xmath88 corresponds to a path consisting of three geodesic segments .",
    "as the curve complex is @xmath44-hyperbolic , one may show that if @xmath26 is chosen to be a conjugating word of shortest relative length , then the path @xmath88 is a quasigeodesic path in the curve complex , where the quasigeodesic constants depend on the relative conjugacy bound constant @xmath50 , and the length of @xmath85 .",
    "if we choose @xmath0 to be a collection of group elements of conjugacy length at most @xmath9 , then every element @xmath89 is equal to @xmath27 , where @xmath90 , and the paths @xmath27 are uniformly quasigeodesic over all elements of @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that the first half of the geodesic from @xmath28 to @xmath24 fellow travels with a translate of the inverse of the second half of the geodesic from @xmath28 to @xmath5 . in order to find an upper bound on the probability that this occurs",
    ", it is convenient to express this fellow travelling property in terms of the location of the pair @xmath91 in @xmath31 .",
    "the fact that @xmath27 is quasigeodesic implies that @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath45 is equal to @xmath94 , up to an additive error which only depends on @xmath44 and the quasigeodesic constants .",
    "we may extend the definitions of shadows to subsets @xmath95 by setting @xmath96 to be the union of all @xmath97 over all points @xmath98 .",
    "we may then extend the definition of shadows to subsets @xmath99 , by setting @xmath96 to be the union of all @xmath100 , over all @xmath101 .",
    "in particular , if a random walk @xmath5 lies in @xmath0 , then the pair @xmath30 lies in @xmath102 , a shadow of the diagonal @xmath103 in @xmath104 , where @xmath45 is roughly @xmath105 . by the linear progress result",
    ", we may assume that @xmath45 grows linearly in @xmath6 , up to a set of paths whose measure decays exponentially in @xmath6 .",
    "the distribution of pairs @xmath30 is obviously not independent , as @xmath5 determines @xmath106 , but they are asymptotically independent , and converge to @xmath107 .",
    "in fact , we may approximate the distribution of pairs @xmath108 by the distribution of pairs @xmath109 .",
    "this is because as sample paths converge to the boundary almost surely , it is probable that the the point @xmath5 looks close to the point @xmath110 , as viewed from the origin @xmath28 , as illustrated in figure [ pic : w2n ] below .",
    "similarly , standing at @xmath110 and looking back towards the origin @xmath28 , the point @xmath28 looks close to the midpoint of the path @xmath5 .",
    "if we apply the isometry @xmath111 , this implies that @xmath111 and @xmath112 look close together when viewed from @xmath28 .",
    "we can make this precise , and we show that the probability that @xmath110 lies in the shadow @xmath113 tends to one exponentially quickly , for some @xmath50 which only depends on the constant of hyperbolicity @xmath44 .",
    "the same argument shows that the probability @xmath111 lies in @xmath114 tends to one exponentially quickly .",
    "the pair @xmath115 is independent , and distributed as @xmath116 .",
    "we may then use the fact that the measure for shadows of points decays exponentially in @xmath45 to show that the @xmath116 measure of a shadow of the diagonal in @xmath104 also decays exponentially in @xmath45 .",
    "as @xmath45 grows linearly in @xmath6 , this shows that the probability @xmath5 has bounded translation length decays exponentially in @xmath6 .",

    "we shall always assume that we start at time zero at the identity element of the group .",

    "the location of the random walk at time @xmath6 is given by @xmath120 , and so the distribution of random walks at time @xmath6 is given by the @xmath6-fold convolution of @xmath3 , which we shall write as @xmath41 .",
    "the _ path space _ for the random walk is the probability space @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the set of all infinite sequences of elements @xmath2 , and the the measure @xmath123 is induced by the map @xmath124 .",
    "we shall always require that the group generated by the support of @xmath3 is _ non - elementary _ , which means that it contains a pair of elements with distinct fixed points in @xmath7 .",
    "we do not assume that the probability distribution @xmath3 is symmetric , so the group generated by the support of @xmath3 may be strictly larger than the semi - group generated by the support of @xmath3 . throughout this paper we will need to assume that the probability distribution @xmath3 has finite support .    in @xcite , we showed that it followed from results of kaimanovich and masur @xcite and klarreich @xcite , that a sample path converges almost surely to a uniquely ergodic , and hence minimal , foliation in the gromov boundary of the relative space .",
    "this gives a measure @xmath42 on @xmath125 , known as _",
    "harmonic measure_. the harmonic measure @xmath42 is @xmath3-stationary , i.e. @xmath126    @xcite [ theorem : converge ] consider a random walk on the mapping class group of an orientable surface of finite type , which is not a sphere with three or fewer punctures , determined by a probability distribution @xmath3 such that the group generated by the support of @xmath3 is non - elementary .",
    "then a sample path @xmath127 converges to a uniquely ergodic foliation in the gromov boundary @xmath125 of the relative space @xmath128 almost surely , and the distribution of limit points on the boundary is given by a unique @xmath3-stationary measure @xmath42 on @xmath125 .",
