    "the geometric collective model ( gcm ) of gneuss , mosel , and greiner  @xcite provides a description of nuclear quadrupole surface excitations using a schrdinger - like hamiltonian .",

    "the potential energy depends only upon the shape of the nucleus , not its orientation in space , and can thus be expressed purely in terms of the bohr - mottelson shape coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath0  @xcite , as @xmath8 the eigenproblem is commonly solved by diagonalization in a basis of harmonic oscillator wave functions  @xcite .",
    "once wave functions for the nuclear eigenstates are calculated , electromagnetic matrix elements can be evaluated .",

    "attempts have been made to derive the parameters in the collective hamiltonian operator  ( [ eqngcmhamiltonian ] ) from models of the underlying single particle dynamics ( _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "however , the necessary theory is not sufficiently well developed to provide a full description of the nuclear phenomenology . an alternative , more pragmatic approach is to choose the collective hamiltonian so as to best reproduce observed nuclear properties .",
    "the gcm hamiltonian with eight parameters ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ) accomodated by the existing codes is capable of describing a rich variety of nuclear structures and can flexibly reproduce many details of potential energy surface shapes  @xcite .",
    "manual selection of parameter values in this full eight - parameter model is impractical , so parameter values for the description of a particular nucleus must be found through automated fitting  @xcite of the nuclear observables .",
    "this process introduces technical difficulties associated with reliable minimization in eight - dimensional space , and often the parameter values appropriate to a nucleus are underdetermined by the available observables  @xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the available data are usually sufficient to establish the qualitative nature of the gcm potential and determine the coefficients of lower order terms , while the higher - order parameters produce only fine adjustments to the predicted structure .",

    "@xcite ) . with fewer parameters in the hamiltonian ,",
    "it is more feasible to survey the full range of phenomena accessible in the parameter space , and the parameter values applicable to a given nucleus are much more fully determined by the available observables .",
    "these benefits must be weighed against the limitations inherent in using the truncated model : the full generality of the gcm is forsaken , precluding , for instance , the description of rigid triaxiality ( _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and , even within its qualitative domain of applicability , the truncated model can be expected to have reduced flexibility in reproducing subtleties of the potential energy surface .",
    "the truncated form of the gcm hamiltonian  ( [ eqnhtrunc ] ) still contains four parameters ( @xmath15 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the relationship between a set of values for these parameters and the structure of the resulting predictions is not evident without detailed calculations",
    ". it would be useful to have a model which covers the full range of features needed for description of the physical system but which simultaneously has a dependence upon its parameters which is simple , qualitatively predictable by inspection , and directly understandable .",
    "it is therefore desirable to further simplify the gcm parameter space , but _ without _ additional truncation of the model .    in the present work ,",
    "analytic scaling relations are applied to reduce the effective number of model parameters from four to two ( section  [ secscaling ] ) .",
    "analytic estimates of the dependence of the model predictions upon these parameters are derived ( section  [ secmapping ] ) , and the model predictions over the entire parameter space are compactly summarized in two - dimensional contour plots ( section  [ secnumerical ] ) .",
    "the results presented considerably simplify the application of the gcm , allowing the parameters relevant to a given nucleus to be deduced essentially by inspection .",
    "a precomputed mesh of calculations covering this parameter space and an associated computer code for extracting observable values are made available through the electronic physics auxiliary publication service ( epaps )  @xcite .",
    "for illustration , the nucleus @xmath1pd is considered , incorporating recent spectroscopic data ( section  [ secillustration ] ) .",
    "two basic properties of the schrdinger equation can considerably simplify the use of the model .",
    "these properties relate the gcm predictions for different sets of parameter values .",
    "first , overall multiplication of any hamiltonian by a constant factor results in multiplication of all eigenvalues by that factor and leaves the eigenstates unchanged .",
    "this transformation leaves unchanged all _ ratios _ of energies , as well as all observables which depend only upon the wave functions .",
    "therefore , all calculations can be performed for some reference value of @xmath15 , varying only @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , and any calculation with another value of @xmath15 would be equivalent to one of these to within a rescaling of energies .",
    "the number of active parameters in the truncated gcm hamiltonian is effectively reduced from four to three .",
    "second , it is a well - known heuristic that `` deepening '' a potential lowers the energies of levels confined within the potential , while `` narrowing '' a potential raises the level energies .",
    "it is thus reasonable that successively deepening and then squeezing a given potential , if performed in the correct proportion , could have effects which offset each other . for the @xmath24-dimensional schrdinger equation , of which the gcm eigenproblem with harmonic kinetic energy is a specific case , this holds exactly .",
    "consider the transformation in which the potential is multiplied by a factor @xmath25 while also dilated by a factor @xmath26 , _",
    "i.e. _ , multiplying @xmath7 by @xmath27 in the argument to @xmath28 , @xmath29 the effect of this transformation is simply to multiply all eigenvalues by a factor @xmath25 and radially dilate the wave functions by @xmath26 ( see appendix ) .",
    "since level energies are multiplied by the same scaling factor @xmath25 as the potential itself , they retain their positions relative to the recognizable `` features '' of the potential , such as barriers or inflection points .",
    "this scaling property allows a further reduction of the number of active parameters in the truncated gcm hamiltonian from three to two , as described in the remainder of this section .    if the electric quadrupole transition operator  ( [ eqnqe2coll ] ) is truncated to its linear term , then all matrix elements of this operator change by the same factor , @xmath30 , under wave function dilation ( see apendix ) .",
    "thus , all @xmath31 values are multiplied by @xmath32 , and @xmath31 _ ratios _ are left unchanged .",
    "many gcm studies have retained the second - order term  @xcite , but inclusion of this or other higher - order terms destroys the simple invariance of @xmath31 ratios , since the different terms in  ( [ eqnqe2coll ] ) scale by different powers of @xmath27 under dilation .",
    "the second - order term usually provides only a relatively small correction to the linear term , and the correct coefficient by which it should be normalized is highly uncertain  @xcite . comparative studies by petkov , dewald , and andrejtscheff  @xcite have shown no clear benefit to its inclusion for the nuclei considered . in light of the simple scaling properties obtained by its omission ,",
    "calculations of @xmath31 strengths are carried out using a linear electric quadrupole operator throughout the present work .    a scaling result equivalent to that just discussed has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite to simplify the automated fitting of experimental data with the full eight - parameter gcm hamiltonian . the canonical transformation @xmath33 and @xmath34 was used to produce wave function dilation with no change in energy scale , equivalent to the transformation  ( [ eqnscalingpotential ] ) followed by an overall multiplication of the hamiltonian by @xmath32 . however , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the second - order form of the quadrupole operator was used , so @xmath31 ratios _ were _ changed under dilation .",
    "therefore , the fitting procedure could only be carried out using energy ratios , and , after fitting , the wave functions were dilated to reproduce a single @xmath31 strength or quadrupole moment .",
    "systematic use of the scaling relations just discussed is facilitated by the adoption of a simple reparametrization of the truncated gcm potential , as @xmath35.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this expression has been constructed so that varying each of the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 controls one specific aspect of the potential :    1 .   etermines the shape of the potential , _",

    "i.e. _ , varying @xmath37 scales @xmath28 in the radial coordinate @xmath7 3 .   is a actor multiplying the entire potential , _",
    "i.e. _ , varying @xmath38 scales the magnitude of @xmath28 .    with this choice of parameters , the transformations of the potential",
    " dilation and overall multiplication   necessary for the application of the scaling properties are achieved simply by varying @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "comparison of the coefficients in ( [ eqnpotldef ] ) with those in the original parametrization ( [ eqnhtrunc ] ) yields the conversion formulae @xmath39    the extremum structure of the truncated gcm potential , investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , can be expressed very concisely in terms of the present parametrization ( [ eqnpotldef ] ) .",
    "extrema occur where @xmath40 is locally extremal with respect to both @xmath7 and @xmath0 individually .",
    "thus , they are possible where @xmath41 attains its maximum value of + 1 ( at @xmath0=0@xmath42 , 120@xmath42 , and 240@xmath42 ) or its minimum value of @xmath43 ( at @xmath0=60@xmath42 , 180@xmath42 , and 300@xmath42 ) .",
    "since the potential ( [ eqnpotldef ] ) repeats every 120@xmath42 in @xmath0 , it suffices to locate the extrema on one particular ray in the @xmath44-plane with @xmath41=+1 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath0=0@xmath42 ) and on one ray with @xmath45=@xmath43 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath0=180@xmath42 ) .",

    "may be accomplished in various ways : by decreasing the mass parameter @xmath15 by a factor of 4 ( bottom left ) , by making the potential narrower by a factor of 2 ( top right ) , or by making the potential shallower by a factor of 4 ( bottom right ) .",
    "the effects of each are equivalent ( see text ) .",
    "[ figseffects ] ]    extrema along the two rays @xmath0=0@xmath42 and @xmath0=180@xmath42 are found by identification of the zeroes of @xmath53 for @xmath41=+1 and for @xmath41=@xmath43 .",
    "the variable @xmath7 is a radial coordinate and so takes on only positive values .",
    "however , the form of the following results is considerably simplified by noting that the only occurrence of @xmath45 in ( [ eqnpotldef ] ) is in a product also containing the only occurrence of an odd power of @xmath7 , so substituting @xmath45=@xmath43 is algebraically equivalent to setting @xmath45=@xmath54 and negating @xmath7 .",
    "any extremum occuring for @xmath45=@xmath43 will thus be found when the extrema for @xmath45=+1 are sought , but at a fictitious `` negative '' @xmath7 value . a simple expression for the @xmath7 values yielding extrema along @xmath0=0@xmath42 follows , but it must be interpreted with the proviso that when a negative @xmath7 value is encountered it actually represents a positive @xmath7 value along @xmath0=180@xmath42 .",
    "the extrema of @xmath28 along the @xmath46-axis cut are located at @xmath55 where @xmath56 in terms of @xmath57@xmath12@xmath58 .",
