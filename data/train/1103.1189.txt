    "while the formation of stars is now reasonably well understood , the question related to the distribution of stellar masses at birth characterised by the so called stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , and in particular , about the shape of the imf , is still far from being resolved .",
    "the multiplicity of stars is also well known , in fact , nearly half the stars in the solar neighbourhood have at least one companion , of which , the m - dwarfs form a large proportion ( e.g. duquennoy & mayor 1991 ; fischer & marcy 1992 ; thies & kroupa 2007 ) . an empirical power - law distribution for stellar masses",
    "was first suggested by salpeter ( 1955 ) , however , this distribution was defined for relatively high mass ( greater then 1 m@xmath0 ) stars only .",
    "more recent observations have revealed stellar objects with sub - solar masses , as low as as @xmath10.02 m@xmath0 , the brown - dwarfs ( bds ) , which also appear to have companions .",
    "in fact , the imf for bds suggested by thies & kroupa ( 2008 ) shows a discontinuity at the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "numerous authors have observationally derived the imf for massive star - clusters such as the ic348 ( lada & lada 1995 ; luhman _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; muench _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) , ngc 1333 ( aspin , sandell & russell 1994 ; lada _ et .",
    "1996 ) , and ophiuchus ( e.g. bontemps _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , to name a few .",
    "the similarity in shapes of these respective system imfs has encouraged the idea of a universal imf .",
    "a piece - wise form of such an imf was proposed by kroupa ( 2002 ) , and a lognormal imf , by chabrier ( 2003 ) .",
    "the question relating to the form of the imf raises a more fundamental issue , that of the evolution of prestellar cores , and the factors likely to affect the final distribution of stellar masses .",
    "infrared observations of dense prestellar cores have enabled determination of core masses in a number of nearby star - forming regions , which like the stars themselves , also follow a power - law distribution ( e.g. motte , andr ' e & neri 1998 ; andr ' e _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ; alves _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 ; nutter & ward - thompson 2007 , enoch _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 ; rathborne _ et al .",
    "the similarity between the distribution of core masses and stellar masses is suggestive of the possibility that the stellar imf may derive its form from the former distribution , the so called core mass function ( cmf ) ( e.g. motte _ et .",
    "_ 1998 , nutter & ward - thomson 2007 ) .",
    "it has recently been shown by swift & williams ( 2008 ) that the imf is fairly robust to any variations in the evolutionary history of the prestellar cores .",
    "similarly goodwin _ et al . _",
    "( 2008 ) , starting from a power - law cmf , derived the stellar imf by assuming a core - to - star efficiency of about 15 % .",
    "this problem has also been examined numerically by for instance , bonnell _ et .",
    "( 2006 ) , clark _ et .",
    "( 2008 ) , who have shown that gravitational fragmentation of prestellar clumps could produce a stellar mass distribution similar to the salpeter imf , with a turnover located at approximately the jeans mass of the precollapse clump , and a knee at @xmath10.6 m@xmath0 .",
    "the numerically derived imf by the above authors was shown to become shallower below its knee , consistent with the universal imf suggested by kroupa . in the present work we use a sample of cores with randomly picked masses to derive the stellar - mass distribution for five realisations of the problem .",
    "first , starting with a power - law cmf defined by eqn .",
    "( 1 ) below , we derive the stellar mass distribution for 4 cases : ( a ) cores in this case are initially quiescent , self - gravitating cores are allowed to cool according to a suitable cooling - law , ( b ) similar to ( a ) , however , precollapse cores are additionally supported by a transonic turbulent field , and ( c ) as in ( a ) , the cores are quiescent , but self - gravitating cores are not allowed to cool . finally , ( d ) for a sample of cores having a uniform mass distribution , we derive a stellar mass distribution for quiescent cores while admitting a cooling scheme .",
    "this case is repeated for a higher rate of mass accretion .",
    "the scheme employed for the purpose is outlined in  2 below ; the results are presented and discussed in  3 and  4 , and we conclude in  5 .",
    "we wish to test how crucial is the nature of the initial distribution of prestellar cores in determining the shape of the distribution of stellar masses , in particular the resemblance of the latter with the universal imf .",
    "this hypothesis is tested using an analytic scheme based on the following three premises :    1 .",
    "assumption of the validity of larson s scaling relation defined by eqn .",
    "( 2 ) below , down to the spatial extent of a prestellar core . keeping in mind the smallest length - scale over which the relation is valid , ( typically 0.1 pc ) , our sample of prestellar cores is such that the size of the smallest core in it is larger than this minimum length scale .",
    "2 .   we do not include contribution due to compressional heating of the gas in a self - gravitating core , nor do we account for viscous heating of the protostellar disk .",
    "any additional heating will only raise the mass of putative fragments and probably produce fewer fragments , causing the final distribution to move towards the high - mass end .",
    "however , it is not our aim in a demonstrative calculation such as this one , to resolve the population of sub - stellar dwarfs , a largely recondite area in the theory of star - formation .",
    "investigation of the temporal stability of the attendant circumstellar disk is beyond the scope of the proposed deduction , so we simply work out the maximum number of sub - stellar fragments likely to condense out of the disk over the time required for the protostellar envelope to be blown off via feedback . having accounted for protostellar feedback from the first generation of protostars ,",
    "the calculations were terminated on formation of the next generation of stars , where possible , out of residual gas in a core .",
    "it is reasonable to so do since most of the gas in a core will have been consumed by the two generations of stars ; some gas from the core may indeed be lost via feedback .",
    "we note that under the proposed scheme , discussed in  2.1 , we are only estimating the maximum number of fragments likely to condense out of a self - gravitating core . in the first three realisations of the problem",
    ", we use a sample of 14,000 randomly picked cores having individual mass , @xmath2 , in the range 0.5 to 10 .",
    "the core masses are distributed according to a power - law , @xmath3 with slope , @xmath4 suggested by nutter & ward - thompson ( 2007 ) , for prestellar cores in the orion molecular cloud ; @xmath5 is the number of cores in the range ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) . the initial distribution of core masses in our test sample is shown in fig . 1 above .",
    "for the purpose we used a random number seed , @xmath8 , that produced a uniform distribution of random numbers between 0 and 1 . the sample of cores within the desired range of masses is then generated by appropriately scaling the uniform distribution , @xmath9 . the radius of a core , @xmath10 , is calculated using the empirical length scaling relation due to larson ( 1981 ) , @xmath11 under the approximation of a uniform density sphere for a core , the ensemble of prestellar cores in our sample has initial density typically on the order of a few times 10@xmath12 @xmath13 , modulo small variations by a factor of 1 - 2 .",
    "the mass of putative fragments , @xmath14 , the number fragments , and the efficiency of fragmentation , i.e. the star - forming efficiency ( sfe ) , were calculated for twelve choices of core temperature , @xmath15 , in the range 7 k to 30 k. then , in a second realisation of the problem , we raised the effective sound - speed within a precollapse core by superposing a transonic turbulent velocity field having a mean dispersion , @xmath16 , and given by the scaling relation @xmath17 while acknowledging the revision to this scaling relation recently proposed by ballesteros - paredes _ et al . _",
    "( 2010 ) , we are of the opinion that it would largely serve to increase the magnitude of @xmath16 . the canonical prescription due to larson , in our opinion therefore , is sufficient for the proposed demonstrative exploration .",
    "+   + * _ fragmentation of a prestellar core _ * the problem of a self - gravitating core has been studied analytically with great rigour for close to four decades , beginning the seminal work by larson ( 1969 ) , penston ( 1969 ) , followed by hunter ( 1977 ) , shu ( 1979 ) , whitworth _",

    "these and a number of other studies have led to two suggestions in which a self - gravitating core could possibly evolve , viz . via gravitational collapse , or competitive accretion .",
    "while the former scenario envisages a self - gravitating core breaking up into a number of protostars , the latter invokes a baby protostar , typically @xmath180.5 m@xmath0 , that grows by accreting gas from a common pool while competing with its siblings to acquire mass .",
    "the scheme adopted in this work is akin to the latter scenario , where the mass of a protostellar baby , @xmath19 , is taken to be @xmath20 m@xmath0 , the jeans mass at @xmath17 k , the lowest choice of prestellar core temperatures in our sample .",
    "the sound speed within a core , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the mean mass of gas molecules , for simplicity we assume the gas to be composed of molecular hydrogen and helium only ; @xmath24 for non - turbulent cores .",
    "we wish to emphasise that only those cores that are gravitationally bound are allowed to fragment , unbound cores are considered still - born and therefore disqualified for further calculations .",
    "we , however , do not accommodate the converse possibility of a super - jeans core remaining starless although such cases have been reported ( e.g. sadavoy _ et .",
    "_ 2010 ) .",
    "protostellar fragments in either scenarios , gravitational fragmentation or competitive accretion , grow by accreting gas , calculations by larson - penston and shu arrive at an accretion rate - @xmath25 which is quite different from the bondi - hoyle(bh ) accretion rate , @xmath26 ( bondi 1952 ) , @xmath27 being the terminal velocity of gas of average density , @xmath28 , accreted by the fragment ; @xmath14 is the mass of the fragment .",
    "schmeja & klessen ( 2004 ) , with their suite of numerical simulations suggested an empirical time - dependant rate of accretion @xmath29 for fitting parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 . while the bh - accretion rate provides an upper limit , that due to larson - penston , hunter or shu , is constant in time . in case of a self - gravitating core ,",
    "the mass , @xmath32 , within a radius @xmath33 is @xmath34 where the integral in the second equality on the right hand side above accounts for any modulation due to protostellar feedback .",
    "the foregoing discussion seeks to underline the difficulties in estimating the rate at which a protostellar fragment accretes gas . in the simplest case , that of bh accretion , @xmath35 m@xmath0 yr@xmath36 , provides the upper limit , while that due to larson - penston and shu is @xmath37 m@xmath0 yr@xmath36 , which probably , is the lower limit .",

    "feedback from a protostar ejects some mass from the natal core , and heats up the rest of it which is then tested for possible formation of the next protostar .",
    "the process is continued till the core is exhausted whence star - formation is quenched .",
    "young protostars drive energetic winds , and often , are associated with more energetic , and collimated molecular jets which inject considerable energy in star - forming regions and supposedly regulate star - formation episodes ( e.g. lada 1985 ) .",
    "while energetic jets are likely to puncture the cocoon enclosing a protostar to deposit the associated momentum outside the parent core , the weaker protostellar wind , on the other hand , may have a significant interaction with collapsing core and heat it ( e.g. wilkin & stahler 1998 ) .",
    "below we estimate the rate at which protostellar wind drives out gas from the collapsing core with the help of a model suggested by wilkin & stahler ( 1998 ) .",

    "while the hierarchical fragmentation scheme produced a distribution similar to the canonical imf , the type of fragmentation envisaged in it lacks supporting numerical evidence . we shall now proceed to discuss individual realisation in this work . + * case 1 : ( non - turbulent cores ) * we obtained a collective sample of @xmath1166,000 stars for various choices of core temperature , @xmath15 , between 7k-30k .",
    "the distribution of fragment masses for this case has been plotted as a histogram in red in fig .",

    "2 . greater turbulent support raises the thermal jeans mass , manifested by a rightward shift in the knee of the resultant stellar mass distribution that now appears at @xmath10.8 m@xmath0 ; it falls off rapidly for @xmath730.8 .",
    "the formation of dwarfs though , according to the simple arguments presented here , may not be significantly affected due to the introduction of an additional thermal component in the form of a transonic turbulent velocity field .",

    "we allude this deficiency to the upward revision of the initial protostellar mass , @xmath19 , due to warmer gas .",
    "remarkably enough , starting from a uniform distribution of core masses in case 4a , but with thermal details identical to those in case 1 , the stellar mass distribution derived here resembles the universal imf which emphasises the relative importance of physical processes such as the rate of protostellar accretion over the initial distribution of core masses . increasing @xmath38 , as in case 4b , for instance , led to a considerable overpopulation in the range ( 0.2,1)m@xmath0 , rendering the distribution flat .",

    "the distribution of stellar masses appears sensitive to the thermal properties of self - gravitating cores , and the rate at which protostars accrete matter from the natal cores ( cases 1 , 2 & 3 in  3 ) , interestingly enough , it appears intransitive to the preceding distribution of core masses ( cases 4a & 4b ) . we therefore suggest , the apparent similarity between the observationally derived cmf , such as the one given by eqn .",

    "the sfe , however , appears unaffected by the injection of a little turbulence in parent cores ( case 2 in  3 ) , although the stellar mass distribution is shifted a little towards the higher mass end , and the shift is considerable when self - gravitating cores are not allowed to cool .",
    "there is a deficiency of fragments less massive than @xmath10.1 m@xmath0 in the latter case .",
    "the prestellar cores in our test sample had roughly similar initial density modulo variation by a factor of 2 - 3 , and so , they evolved on a mutually comparable timescale . in view of the empirical nature of the scaling relations defined by eqns .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) above , it appears that despite spanning a wide range of masses , the prestellar cores may have approximately comparable initial densities , and therefore , evolve over similar timescales .",
    "the distribution of stellar masses derived here is therefore fairly robust , and inoculated against variations in the evolutionary timescales of the cores in the ensemble . in order to place this argument on a stronger footing",
    ", we must further investigate the formation of prestellar cores , and their congenital properties .",

    "<S> in the present work we examined the hypothesis that , a core mass function ( cmf ) , such as the one deduced for cores in the orion molecular cloud ( omc ) , could possibly be the primogenitor of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) . using the rate of accretion of a protostar from its natal core as a free parameter , we demonstrate its quintessential role in determining the shape of the imf . by varying the rate of accretion , </S>",
    "<S> we show that a stellar mass distribution similar to the universal imf could possibly be generated starting from either a typical cmf such as the one for the omc , or a uniform distribution of prestellar core masses which leads us to suggest , the apparent similarity in shapes of the cmf and the imf is perhaps , only incidental . </S>",
    "<S> the apodosis of the argument being , complex physical processes leading to stellar birth are crucial in determining the final stellar masses , and consequently , the shape of stellar mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this work entails partial monte - carlo treatment of the problem , and starting with a randomly picked sample of cores , and on the basis of classical arguments which include protostellar feedback and cooling due to emission from warm dust , a theoretical distribution of stellar masses is derived for five realisations of the problem ; the magnetic field , though , has been left out of this exercise .    </S>",
