    "higher resolution work does show some changes typically at the level of 0.5 mev .",

    "moreover , the discrepancies become smaller if magnetism is included in the calculations . in general , this is also in good agreement with previous results .",

    "some report the improvement possible using magnetic calculations ; phonon dos of bafe@xmath9as@xmath9 ( refs .  ) , @xmath5fe@xmath9as@xmath9 and @xmath5feasf ( ref .  ) , phonon dispersion of cafe@xmath9as@xmath9 ( ref .  ) , smfeas(o , f ) ( ref .  ) , ( ba , k)fe@xmath9as@xmath9 and ba(fe , co)@xmath9as@xmath9 ( refs .  ) . here",
    "we note that the most pronounced softening is observed for high energy plane - polarized modes ( @xmath283035 mev ) in our present work , while most of the previous results were focused to @xmath2920 mev especially in the phonon dispersions .",
    "given the generally good agreement of our calculations of the ferromagnetically polarized modes with the measurements on the magnetically ordered parent below @xmath25 , the remaining discrepancy between the calculated high energy for the antiferromagnetically polarized modes and the measurements which show a lower energy ( essentially the same as the ferromagnetically polarized modes ) is surprising .",
    "this is a strong result in that essentially all of our measurements only show the lower energy modes , and is highlighted by the complete lack of splitting ( to the 0.5 mev level ) for the occasion when we specifically examined a twinned portion of the sample .",
    "a similar lack of splitting was also observed by reznik _",
    "et al._@xcite for bafe@xmath9as@xmath9 , though without explicit confirmation of twinning .",
    "we tried to understand the disagreement of data and calculations by ad hoc modifications to our calculation results , and arrived at two models , which have a completely different approach , but both of which show relatively good agreement with the observed data .",
    "first we consider the `` clipped '' model . in this model",
    "we use the `` magnetic '' calculation , and include additional in - plane anisotropy to cancel the anisotropy originating from the magnetic order .",
    "the observed in - plane phonon dispersion of even antiferromagnetically ordered phase is surprisingly isotropic in the fe - as plane . therefore , additional anisotropy in the force constant matrices is indispensable , if we based it on `` magnetic '' calculation which it is now widely believed to be the reasonable calculation of the iron - arsenide system .",
    "the anisotropy in the fe - as plane , included in `` clipped '' model , is also suggested by other experiments .",
    "for example , from magnetic excitation measurements by ins large anisotropic exchange coupling is suggested in cafe@xmath9as@xmath9 [ @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( ref .  ) or @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( ref .  ) ] or in fese@xmath34te@xmath34 ( ref .  ) .",
    "for these the strong correlation is along the ferromagnetic direction in the `` clipped '' model [ fig .",
    "[ fig : motion2](b ) ] , while the spin - spin coupling is stronger in the antiferromagnetic direction [ fig .",
    "[ fig : motion2](c ) ] .",
    "moreover , recently orbital ordering in iron - pnictides has been discussed . using the polarized laser angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) two - fold symmetry",
    "is observed in electronic structure of the fe 3@xmath35 orbital in bafe@xmath9as@xmath9 below @xmath25 ( ref .  ) .",
    "such orbital ordering also causes in - plane anisotropy and even might explain@xcite the above - mentioned in - plane magnetic anisotropy of the spin waves .",
    "these anisotropic effects seem to suggest some support for the `` clipped '' model .",
    "however , the residual anisotropy of mode energies in the `` clipped '' model is larger than observed , and attempts to reduce it to the level measured ( e.g. , by including an attractive term ) are not successful . given the evidences for anisotropy ( e.g. , in spin wave@xcite , transport measurements@xcite , small ( @xmath140.5 mev ) splitting of phonon modes in raman scattering@xcite ) it seems probable that the reality is a nearly isotropic model , with some very small anisotropy . however , the reason the direct _ ab initio _ calculations so strongly over - estimate the anisotropy is not clear .",
    "the `` in - plane soft '' model is an alternative based on the `` original '' microscopically in - plane isotropic calculation .",
    "we slightly soften only the in - plane components of force constants while preserving the out - of - plane component .",
    "this is an improved version of our previous `` soft fe - as '' model@xcite , based on the _ nonmagnetic _ calculation .",
    "however , it shows as good as or even better agreement with the measured phonon structure compared to the `` clipped '' model .",
    "therefore , it seems worth considering nonmagnetic calculations again , because experimentally the magnetic order does not strongly affect the phonon structure , and the dispersion is essentially isotropic in many iron - arsenides .",
    "finally we consider the effect of magnetic fluctuations , which is widely discussed and has the possibility to reduce the in - plane anisotropy .",
    "one model by mazin and johannes@xcite , suggested there are always antiferromagnetic domains , but the boundaries fluctuate .",
    "thus depending on the time scale of an experimental probe relative to these fluctuations , different determinations may be made about the presence of magnetism .",
    "they suggested that many of the physical properties of iron - arsenide compounds , both experimental and theoretical , may be explained by this . with this model",
    "the small observed fe magnetic moment is explained as by averaging over zero - point and fast magnetic domain motion .",
    "thus , mssbauer experiments@xcite and @xmath15sr@xcite , that probe relatively slow ( @xmath1910 ns ) timescales would see primarily nonmagnetic response , as they do , while probes of faster time scales might see magnetic response , such as the splitting observed in photo - emission@xcite .",
    "ins investigations , in fact , show magnetic fluctuations at finite energy ( @xmath140.2 ps time scales ) even in superconducting samples and/or at high temperature above transition@xcite .",
    "however , it seems unlikely to us that the presence of fluctuations can fully explain the difference between our calculations and our data .",
    "phonon time scales are given by the oscillation period ( @xmath140.1 ps for a 30 mev mode ) , and the phonon lifetime ( @xmath140.7 ps for a 1 mev mode ) linewidth .",
    "fluctuations on that are slow on the ps time scale should lead to splitting of modes , while those with timescales @xmath180.1 ps should lead to unsplit phonons that see the average structure .",
    "the magnetic calculations give mode splittings of several mev while for the particular case of fig .",
    "[ fig : dis_h00 ] , for example , our data would support splittings no larger than a few tenths of a mev .",
    "also , the observed mode energy is in good agreement with the one of the two calculated modes , not their average .",
    "thus , we speculate there is some additional neglected factor , not only magnetic fluctuations , that leads to the overestimation of the calculated phonon anisotropy in these systems .",
    "extensive investigation of phonon dispersion in several samples of prfeaso@xmath0 allow careful comparison of results between different samples , and with calculations .",
    "small changes were visible as the material was doped into the superconducting state ( from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ) , and when the parent materials was cooled below the magnetic and structural phase transition .",
    "smaller changes were visible when superconducting samples were cooled across @xmath3 .",
    "interpretation of the observed small changes with doping or temperature in this system is complicated by the generally larger disagreement with calculations .",
    "magnetic calculations compare more favorably to the data , especially the ferromagnetically polarized phonon modes , but show splitting between ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically polarized modes ( several mev ) that is not at all supported by the experimental data ( @xmath180.5 mev ) .",
    "interestingly , the in - plane isotropy of phonon properties can be constructed from both microscopically anisotropic ( magnetic ) and isotropic ( nonmagnetic ) calculations .",
    "it is clear that while the _ ab initio _ calculations provide a reasonable rough estimate of phonon dispersion , they lack some fundamental ingredient . given the similarity of the measured response for both the magnetically ordered parent material below @xmath25 and the other systems , however , is seems unlikely that the missing ingredient might be only magnetic fluctuations .",
