    "the hovering magnetic top is an ingenious device that hovers in mid - air while spinning .",
    "it is marketed as a kit in the u.s.a . and",
    "europe under the trade name levitron@xmath8 @xcite and in japan under the trade name u - cas@xcite .",
    "the whole kit consists of three main parts : a magnetized top which weighs about 18gr , a thin ( lifting ) plastic plate and a magnetized square base plate ( base ) . to operate the top",
    "one should set it spinning on the plastic plate that covers the base .",
    "the plastic plate is then raised slowly with the top until a point is reached in which the top leaves the plate and spins in mid - air above the base for about 2min .",
    "the hovering height of the top is approximately 3.0 cm above the surface of the base whose dimensions are about 10@xmath910@xmath92 cm .",
    "the kit comes with extra brass and plastic fine tuning weights as the apparatus is very sensitive to the weight of the top .",
    "it also comes with two wedges to balance the base horizontally .",
    "the hovering magnetic top serves as an excellent model to study many branches of physics .",
    "these include magnetism , electricity , hydrodynamics , mechanics of rigid body , wave mechanics , dynamical stability of non linear as well as linear systems , life time of quasi - stationary states and solid state magnetism to name just a few .",
    "for example , in the field of neutral particle trapping the hovering magnetic top is a vivid macroscopic device which demonstrates how it is possible to trap a neutral particle with spin in a static magnetic field .",
    "in fact , one of the recent examples of such traps was devised and applied to trap rb@xmath10 atoms and to form bose - einstein condensation@xcite .",
    "the trap used in this experiment is based on a rotating magnetic field and was given the name top ( time - averaged orbiting potential ) trap .",
    "though the top trap consists of a time dependent field it nevertheless operates on roughly the same principles as the trap of the hovering magnetic top .",
    "in addition to understanding magnetic traps there are many other issues that can be addressed by studying the hovering magnetic top .",
    "questions such as : how high can it hover ?",
    ", how long does it hover ?",
    ", what are the tolerances on the mass of the top and the tilt angle of the base ?",
    "how the trap works in the quantum regime ? and",
    "other questions have been studied recently @xcite whereas other questions such as how does friction affect the stability of the top are currently under study .",
    "the physical principles underlying the dynamical stability of the hovering magnetic top rely on the so - called ` adiabatic approximation ' and have recently been discussed in several papers @xcite . in these articles",
    "the top was modeled as an axially symmetric shape with its magnetization taken as a dipole pointing along the symmetry axis and situated at the center of mass . observing the top as it hovers",
    "forced us however , to augment this picture by assuming that the dipole is canted by a small angle @xmath11 with respect to the symmetry axis of the top .",
    "we were motivated by the fact that the motion of the magnetic top as it hovers looked different from that of a classical top ( but also by recalling that it would be forced by manufacturing tolerances ) .",
    "as a classical top slows down it starts to deviate from the vertical while it precesses with a frequency which is not synchronous to the frequency of the spin of the top around its axis .",
    "the axis of the hovering magnetic top is also canted to the vertical but the motion is synchronous .",
    "there is only one frequency involved .",
    "this can even be seen with the naked eye .",
    "the axis of the magnetic top rotates around the vertical but _ synchronously _ with the spin of the top around itself .",
    "an analogy , though not literal , is helpful here : the motion of the hovering magnetic top is reminiscent of the motion of the moon around the earth but that of a classical top is more like the rotation of the earth around the sun . the astute observer watching the hovering magnetic top will note that the canting increases as the top slows down , even with the naked eye .",
    "it was more conspicuous to us when we observed it with a stroboscope preferably strobed at twice or three times the synchronous frequency . using the latter frequency enabled also to measure the phase of the tilt .",
    "it is this way that we found this phase is correlated to the phase of @xmath11- the canting of the magnetic moment with respect to the axis of the top .",
    "we reach the same conclusion by observing in slow motion videos of hovering tops in which we changed @xmath11 artificially .",
    "as will be shown in the following the canting @xmath11 explains all the above observations .",
    "the present paper is in fact a study of the effect of this small canting @xmath11 on the hovering of the magnetic top .",
    "in addition to explaining the above qualitative features we also derive quantitative results . in particular we show that the minimum angular velocity required for stability @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the principal and secondary moment of inertia , @xmath6 is the magnetic moment of the top and @xmath7 is the magnetic field .",
    "this result is to be contrasted with the minimum speed of a classical top@xcite which is given by @xmath0 for both @xmath3 and @xmath1 .    on the experimental side ,",
    "we have measured the minimum speed of a hovering top whose moment of inertia @xmath5 can be changed so as to cover values both below and above @xmath4 .",
    "these results show excellent agreement with our calculations .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in sec.([sec2 ] ) we carry out a detailed analysis of the synchronous motion .",
    "we first describe precisely what is meant by the synchronous motion and define our notations in sec.([sec2.1 ] ) . in sec.([sec2.2 ] ) we study the conditions that must be met in order for the system to reach equilibrium .",
    "next , in sec.([sec2.3 ] ) we carry out a dynamical stability analysis to find under what conditions the equilibrium solution found previously is indeed stable . finally , in sec.([sec2.4 ] ) we combine all the conditions that were found both from equilibrium considerations and dynamical stability considerations , and arrive at the expressions for the minimum angular velocity .",
    "the description of our experiment and a comparison of the results with the theoretical calculations from the previous section is given in sec.([sec3 ] ) .",
    "in sec.([sec4 ] ) , we summarize our results and discuss possible extensions of the calculations presented in this paper and other related subjects .",
    "as the top hovers above the magnetized plate , the magnetic lift force exerted by the base is balanced by the top weight .",
    "therefore , to simplify further calculations we assume that gravity is zero and the magnetic field is homogeneous .",
    "further , we disregard the translational motion of the top and assume that it move around a fixed point . this point is taken as the common origin of the moving and fixed system of coordinates . with these simplifications",
    "the synchronous motion can be modeled as shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "= 3.8233 in    the figure describes a top that rotates rigidly around the vertical @xmath14 axis with angular velocity @xmath15 .",
    "the principal axis of the top ( axis @xmath16 ) makes an angle @xmath17 with the vertical axis .",
    "the whole system is in a uniform magnetic field @xmath7 , pointing downward .",
    "the top possesses a magnetic moment dipole , @xmath6 , that makes an angle @xmath11 with its principal axis .",
    "we first determine the angle between the top axis @xmath16 and the vertical axis @xmath14 from torque equilibrium .",
    "the angular momentum of a symmetric top has the form@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the component of the vector angular velocity @xmath20 in the direction of the @xmath16 axis .",
    "since @xmath16 is fixed in the body , @xmath21 and therefore @xmath22 for the synchronous motion , the gyroscopic torque in the co - moving frame must compensate the magnetic torque , hence @xmath23 thus , @xmath24 has to be coplanar with @xmath14 and @xmath25 , and one obtain , with @xmath26 , the equilibrium condition    @xmath27    we assume that the angle @xmath11 is small .",
    "then , during its motion the top axis @xmath16 stays close to the @xmath14 axis , and we may use small angle approximation in eq.([eq14 ] ) and express @xmath17 in terms of @xmath15 as follows : @xmath28 in order to understand what eq.([eq20 ] ) means we must resort to a more realistic description of the hovering top .",
    "if we take into account air friction and the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field , the following picture emerges : as the top hovers , it experience air friction which causes @xmath15 to decrease with time .",
    "thus , according to eq.([eq20 ] ) @xmath17 increases provided that @xmath1 ( a disk - like top ) .",
    "this , on the other hand , decreases the repulsive force on the top which is caused by the field gradient .",
    "thus , the top rebalances itself at a lower height .",
    "this process continues until the field gradient reaches its maximum value , that occurs at a height equal roughly to half the size of the base . at this point",
    "the magnetic field can no longer support the top and the latter falls down vertically . in our experiments",
    "we could clearly see that @xmath17 increases gradually by the naked eye .",
    "we conclude that when @xmath17 is ` large enough ' the top will fall down .",
    "we denote by @xmath29 the maximum allowed angle .",
    "the angular velocity which correspond to this angle is , according to eq.([eq20 ] ) , given by @xmath30 to estimate @xmath29 we recall that the tolernace on the weight is equal to the toleance allowed on the lift .",
    "it follows that@xcite @xmath31 since the tolerance on the weight is about @xmath32 ( see ref.@xcite ) it follows that @xmath33rad .",
    "although we did not measure @xmath11 directly , our experiments , including those in which we have artificially changed @xmath11 indicate that @xmath34 .",
    "it is therefore justified to neglect this term in eq.([eq20.0 ] ) and we arrive to an approximate expression for the minimum speed when @xmath1 , namely : @xmath35    for a rod - like top ( @xmath3 ) the synchronous motion is also possible , but now @xmath11 must be more negative than @xmath36 .",
    "this is because in this case the direction of the centrifugal torque is _ reversed , _ and for equilibrium to exist the magnetic torque must also be reversed .",
    "the condition that @xmath37 gives @xmath38 which signifies that as far as the equilibrium condition is concerned there is no minimum speed for this case .",
    "following similar arguments as before it can be easily deduced that in this case @xmath17 _ decreases _ with time and the top slowly _",
    "gains _ height as it slows down due to air friction .",
    "this is opposite of what we have found for a disk - like top .    note also that the rod - like top exhibits _",
    "diamagneic_-like behavior .",
    "namely , the differential susceptibility is in this case _ negative _ as can be seen from eq.([eq20 ] ) .    summarizing our results so far",
    "we conclude that as far as the equilibrium condition is concerned the minimum allowed angular velocity depends on the eccentricity of the top and is given by    @xmath39    and is valid both for clockwise and counter - clockwise directions of the spin .",
    "note that eq.([eq20.1 ] ) is not the all answer because the dynamical stability should also be considered .",
    "this is done in the following section .",
    "up to this point we have studied conditions that were derived directly from the equilibrium condition . in this section",
    "we study the conditions that must be met in order to sustain the synchronous motion .",
    "we start by reformulating the equations of motion in terms of the lagrangian formalism and euler s angles , and then add to the synchronous motion a small perturbation .",
    "we then arrive at a set of equations for the perturbational part and find the conditions that are required for the perturbation to be oscillatory which is the condition that the unperturbed motion is stable .",
    "we denote the coordinate system fixed in space by @xmath40 and the other that is fixed in the body by @xmath41 , as depicted in fig.([fig2 ] ) .",
    "= 4.0248 in    the magnetic moment @xmath42 makes an angle @xmath11 with the @xmath16 axis and lies in the @xmath43-@xmath16 plane .",
    "thus @xmath44 the magnetic field is uniform and points along the @xmath45 direction , i.e. @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the first , second and third euler s angles , defined in fig.([fig2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetic energy for this configuration has the form @xmath50 the kinetic energy , expressed using euler s angle , is @xmath51 the lagrangian @xmath52 is given by the difference between the kinetic energy @xmath53 and the magnetic energy @xmath54 , @xmath55 the dynamics of motion for this system is then governed by the lagrange equations of motion @xmath56 with the lagrangian given in eq.([eq21 ] ) one obtains    @xmath57",

    "we now perturb the stationary solution by adding small variations , @xmath62 substituting this these into eqs.([eq23 ] ) and keeping only first - order terms yields    @xmath63    using eq.([eq25 ] ) we express @xmath11 in terms of @xmath17 and to simplify further calculations we now restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath17 is a small angle and work to second - order in @xmath17 . under the small - angle approximation eqs.([eq27 ] ) becomes @xmath64 where @xmath65 .    since eqs.([eq28 ] ) are linear in the perturbations and homogenous , the general solution of these equations is a linear combination of exponential functions .",
    "we therefore set @xmath66 and substitute these into eqs.([eq28 ] ) .",
    "the result is the matrix equation for the determination of the eigenvalues @xmath67",
    "@xmath68 = \\left [   \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\   0 \\\\   0 \\end{array } \\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the matrix given by :    @xmath70 \\theta _ { 0}^{2 } \\end{array } \\right ) \\\\",

    "the other eigenvalues are the roots of a quadratic equation in @xmath73 .    for the perturbation to be bounded for all times , the non - vanishing eigenvalues must be purely imaginary .",
    "thus , the two @xmath73 roots must be both real and negative . the condition for these roots to be real",
    "is that @xmath74 .",
    "this results in the inequality @xmath75 which is the well - known stability condition of a classical top with one point fixed@xcite . for both roots",
    "to be negative , their product must be positive ( i.e. @xmath76 ) and their sum must be negative ( @xmath77 ) . since both @xmath78 and @xmath79 are squares of real numbers , their ratio _ is _ positive .",
    "we thus find as the second condition    @xmath80    it may be easily verified that for a physical top , for which @xmath81 , the inequality eq.([eq31 ] ) is satisfied whenever eq.([eq30 ] ) holds . therefore , the overall condition for the _ stability _ of the synchronous motion is given by eq.([eq30 ] ) alone , namely @xmath82 both for @xmath1 and for @xmath3 .",
    "hitherto we have found separate conditions for the minimum angular speed , one pair given in eq.([eq20.1 ] ) arising from equilibrium considerations , the other one given in eq.([eq32 ] ) originating from dynamical stability considerations . since these conditions must be satisfied simultaneously",
    ", we now take the _ union _ of these conditions .",
    "taking into account the fact that for a disk - like top @xmath83 is larger than @xmath0 , we find that the union of these conditions amounts to the following expressions for @xmath12 : @xmath84 according to this result , there should be an abrupt change in @xmath12 in the vicinity of a sphere - like top ( @xmath85 ) even for a vanishingly small value of the angle @xmath11 .",
    "this abrupt change is also found in our experiments , as is shown in the next section .",
    "to test our calculations we have built a magnetized top whose moment of inertia @xmath5 can be changed so as to cover values both below and above @xmath4 .",
    "we have measured the minimum angular speed of the top for several values of @xmath86 .",
    "fig.([fig3 ] ) shows ( in bullets ) the reciprocal of the measured angular speed normalized to the minimum angular speed of a pure disk top versus @xmath87 . to compare these results to our calculation",
    "we rewrite eq.([eq33 ] ) as an equation for the normalized reciprocal angular speed @xmath88 in terms of @xmath89 .",
    "the result is @xmath90 fig.([fig3 ] ) shows @xmath91 as a solid line .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the experimental results support our theory .",
    "the two main features of our theoretical results are : 1 ) the divergence of @xmath12 for disk - like tops as they approach spherical shape and 2 ) the discontinuity in @xmath12 as one goes over to rod - like top .",
    "1 ) unfortunately , we could not go beyond @xmath92 because the maximum spin frequency is limited by the dynamic stability of the top in the trap@xcite .",
    "it is therefore impossible to observe experimentally the above divergence .",
    "2 ) though we have only two measured points at the rod - like part of the graph it is conspicuous that they verify the difference in the origin of the instability for disk- and rod - like tops that our theory shows .",
    "= 4.8732 in",
    "in this paper we have analyzed one possible cause for the synchronous motion and attributed it to the small difference between the direction of the principal axis of inertia and the direction of the magnetic moment .",
    "we have shown that as a consequence , for a disk - like top the minimum angular velocity required for stability _ differs _ from that for a classical top ( with one point fixed ) and is given by : @xmath93 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the principal and secondary moment of inertia , @xmath6 is the magnetic moment of the top and @xmath7 is the magnetic field .",
    "this result is found to be in a very good agreement with our experiments .",
    "we remark that in the calculations presented in this paper we have neglected some aspects which are relevant to the behavior of the top .",
    "for example , the dipole moment of the top carries with it a minute amount of _ intrinsic _ _ spin _ of the order of @xmath94 where @xmath95 is planck s constant and @xmath96 is the bohr s magneton .",
    "the existence of the spin contributes an additional term to the total angular momentum written in eq.([eq12 ] ) . in this case",
    "the symmetry between clockwise ( cw ) and counter - clockwise ( ccw ) rotations breaks down , and one finds _ different _",
    "values for the minimum angular speed for each direction . due to the smallness of the spin with respect to the orbital angular momentum ,",
    "the cw - ccw asymmetry becomes pronounced only when the _ size _ of the top is of the order of tenths of microns .",
    "our calculations show that when the sense of rotation is roughly antiparallel to the direction of the spin the minimum angular speed increases , whereas when it is roughly parallel to the spin , the minimum angular speed decreases .",
    "this conclusion immediately raises the question whether it is possible to hover a top using its intrinsic spin alone without the need to spin it . to study this",
    "we assume the top to be endowed intrincily with spin proportional to its magnetic moment .",
    "we find that it may be possible to hover a top having only this spin with no additional angular momentum@xcite .",
    "another interesting point is what happens if we relinquish the requirement that @xmath17 is small .",
    "note that the equilibrium equation eq.([eq14 ] ) is that of the well - known stoner and wolfarth model ( sw)@xcite , extensively used to described the hysteresis of single domain ferromagnetic particles . in that case at most only _ two _ of the equilibria are stable .",
    "we find , however , in our case the unstable sw becomes stable under some conditions , being stabilized by the dynamics .",
    "a word of warning is due here when applying these results to the hovering top .",
    "we have in this work considered only the rotational degrees of freedom , and what is stable under these is not necessarily stable any more in an inhomogeneous field necessary to trap the top .",
    "we believe however that the small angle solution is still stable there under the same conditions that are given by us@xcite for @xmath97 ."
