    "after a rapid quench through a symmetry - breaking phase transition a many - body system will form causally disconnected spatial domains , each making an independent choice for the symmetry broken order parameter .",
    "the coarsening dynamics of how such a system subsequently evolves towards equilibrium is an area of broad interest @xcite . at long times",
    "after the quench a universal scaling regime can develop : correlation functions of the order parameter collapse to a universal scaling function ( independent of time @xmath1 ) when space is scaled by a characteristic length @xmath2 . the growth law for this characteristic length @xmath3 yields the dynamic critical exponent @xmath4 .",
    "while most classical theories for coarsening dynamics have been developed for dissipative models related to temperature quenches , recently there has been growing interest in the dynamics of systems under conservative hamiltonian evolution , particularly due to developments with ultra - cold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "here we will focus on the coarsening dynamics of a ferromagnetic spin-1 condensate .",
    "such spinor condensates are unique in that they exhibit both superfluid and magnetic order @xcite , and have a rich set of zero temperature phases which can be conveniently explored in experiment .",
    "a motivating experiment was performed by the berkeley group with a @xmath5rb condensate that was quenched from a non - magnetized ( polar ) phase into a ferromagnetic phase by a sudden change in the quadratic zeeman energy ( @xmath0 ) of the atoms @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , depending on the value of @xmath0 quenched to , the magnetization that develops can have easy - axis or easy - plane symmetry . in previous work",
    "@xcite we numerically demonstrated that the late time coarsening in these two cases are described by the hydrodynamic binary fluid and model e dynamic universality classes , respectively .",
    "in this paper we expand upon our earlier work , and provide a fuller description of the coarsening dynamics of the ferromagnetic spin-1 condensate .",
    "we simulate quenches for a wide range of @xmath0 values in the easy - axis and easy - plane regimes , and demonstrate that the exponents obtained are universal . supporting these results we develop models of the key processes governing coarsening and apply scaling arguments to obtain the same exponents .",
    "we consider the mean value and fluctuations of the magnetization in the post - quench system to reveal the thermalization of the energy liberated by the quench .",
    "for the easy - axis case we develop a scheme for thermometry using spin - waves and demonstrate that these modes thermalize on a much faster time scale than the order parameter evolution governed by the coarsening dynamics .",
    "we also consider the domain wall structure by evaluating the order parameter structure factor , where the domain wall properties are revealed by a porod tail feature .",
    "interestingly the analysis of the porod tail for the easy - plane case suggests that the domain walls have a fractal structure .",
    "we verify this by directly applying a box - counting algorithm to the spatial domains of the coarsened system .",
    "the easy - plane phase has an order parameter that supports vortices ( polar - core vortices ) as topological defects .",
    "we evaluate the number of topological defects during the coarsening evolution and show that this is directly related to the coarsening length scale of domains .",
    "this work we report here provides a thorough analysis of the coarsening dynamics for the ferromagnetic spin-1 condensate , and establishes a firm basis and set of tools for future work on other quenches ( e.g.  temperature quenches ) and for work on the anti - ferromagnetic and higher spin cases .",

    "we develop analytic models for the relevant degrees of freedom during the coarsening regime .",

    "we demonstrate the important role of polar - core vortices by showing that the number of vortices scales as @xmath99 during the coarsening dynamics .",
    "thus we can interpret easy - plane coarsening as occurring via the mutual annihilation of vortex anti - vortex pairs .    to provide insight into the origin of the growth of order we have discussed simple analytic models that capture the essential dynamics of the coarsening , and",
    "correctly predict the dynamic critical exponents . for the easy - plane phase we can develop such a model based either on the spin - waves or the vortex dynamics , although are unable to analytically obtain the log corrections to the growth law , which remains an area for future investigation .",
    "the structure of the ordered domains was studied by quantifying the porod tails in the order parameter structure factor , and by a direct spatial analysis using the box counting algorithm .",
    "both approaches show that the easy - axis domain walls are regular with a dimension of @xmath113 , whereas the easy - plane domain walls are fractal with a dimension of @xmath235 .",
    "possible physical implications of this fractal structure includes diffusion limited aggregation @xcite , or schramm ( stochastic)-loewner evolution and the associated conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "we also note recent work considering the domain size distribution and domain wall percolation in binary condensates @xcite , which would be an interesting direction to pursue for the spinor system .",
    "we have also considered how the energy liberated from the quench rethermalizes in the system .",
    "the deeper the quench more energy is liberated and the system exhibits larger fluctuations . in order to quantify the thermalization in the easy - axis quench we demonstrate an analysis technique that allows us to measure the temperature and distribution of spin - waves . using this",
    "we show that local equilibrium is established in the spin waves on moderate time scales , but continues to evolve as the order parameter domains anneal .",
    "finally we discuss the requirements that must be met to observe coarsening in experiments .",
    "first , the the size of the condensate must be much larger than the spin healing length @xmath236 . with the development of flat optical traps ( see @xcite )",
    "this condition is easily met .",
    "furthermore , these flat traps minimise inhomogeneous effects present in harmonic trapping potentials , and appear ideally suited to studies of phase transition dynamics .",
    "the second requirement is that the system has a sufficiently long lifetime that the coarsening dynamics can be monitored over timescales much longer than the spin time @xmath237 . in @xmath5rb",
    "this time is typically @xmath238ms and experiments have been able to study coarsening dynamics for times up to @xmath239s @xcite .",
    "our results here would suggest that timescales up to an order of magnitude longer would be necessary to observe universal coarsening behaviour .",
