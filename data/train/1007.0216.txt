    "in order to study qualitative effects of magnetism in plasma dynamics a very simple model is introduced .",
    "two overlapping homogeneous spheres of equal radii , and of equal but oppositely signed charge densities , are assumed to move , relative to each other , with negligible dissipation ( resistivity ) under the influence of electric and magnetic interaction .",
    "the neglect of dissipation is motivated at the end .",
    "we first treat relative translation ( oscillation ) and then relative rotation .",
    "many years ago tonks and langmuir @xcite carefully derived an equation of motion for a collective translational motion of the electrons relative to the positive ions .",
    "their derivation seems to indicate that there should be a universal frequency for this mode , @xmath0 the plasma frequency , depending only on the electron number density @xmath1 .",
    "if a large number of electrons move relative to the positive ions one gets a large current and thus it seems as if magnetic effects should affect the result .",
    "bohm and pines @xcite studied the influence of magnetic interaction on plasma modes but they did not come up with any explicit correction to @xmath2 . in the textbook by goldston and rutherford",
    "@xcite the absence of magnetic effects is said to be due to a displacement current that compensates for the electron current . in this article",
    "the problem is approached from a very fundamental starting point : the relevant lagrangian density .",
    "the conclusion is that the frequency is lowered by the large inductive inertia [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq.freq.sq ] ) ] .",
    "we then study the relative rotation of the two charged spheres .",
    "if magnetic interaction is neglected the kinetic energy is simply determined by angular momentum and moment of inertia . when magnetic interaction is included",
    "the kinetic energy for a given angular momentum is much smaller .",
    "the reason for this is again that the effective moment of inertia will be dominated by inductive inertia .",
    "by adding an external magnetic field to the model we can calculate the response of our model plasma and it turns out to be diamagnetic .",
    "the kinetic energy of any system of particles @xmath3 can be written @xmath4 where @xmath5 is total mass , @xmath6 is the ( instantaneous ) inertia tensor , @xmath7 center of mass velocity , and @xmath8 is a well defined average angular velocity @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 is chosen so that @xmath9 is the total momentum of the system and @xmath8 so that @xmath10 is the total ( center of mass ) angular momentum .",
    "@xmath11 is the kinetic energy of the particles relative to the system that moves with the center of mass velocity and rotates with the average angular velocity .",
    "we call this the co - moving system",
    ". one can introduce generalized coordinates so that there are six degrees freedom describing center of mass position and of average angular orientation , while @xmath11 depends on the remaining @xmath12 generalized coordinates .",
    "now consider a blob of plasma that consists of two spheres of particles , one of positively , and one of negatively charged particles .",
    "for spheres the inertia tensor @xmath6 can be replaced by a single moment of inertia @xmath13 . the total kinetic energy @xmath14 is the sum of the kinetic energy , @xmath15 , of the positive particles , and of the kinetic energy , @xmath16 , of the negative charges .",
    "we first perform the transformation above to the co - moving systems separately for the positive and the negative particles .",
    "this gives , @xmath17 for the total kinetic energy , see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] . in a second step",
    "we then introduce the co - moving system for the total system .",
    "we thus introduce , @xmath18 total mass and reduced mass as well as total moment of inertia and reduced moment of inertia . in terms of",
    "these one finds , @xmath19 for the total center of mass velocity @xmath7 , and relative velocity @xmath20 , of the two spheres .",
    "finally , @xmath21 gives the total average angular velocity @xmath8 , and the relative angular velocity @xmath22 , of the two oppositely charged spheres . in terms of these quantities we get the expression , @xmath23 for the total kinetic energy of our two - sphere system .",
    "the degrees of freedom in @xmath11 are assumed to be random and not to produce any net charge or current density .",
    "they will be ignored henceforth .",
    "maxwell s equations and the equations of motion for the charged particles with the lorentz force , can all be derived from a single lagrangian via the variational principle @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian has three parts , particle , interaction , and field contributions .",
    "if radiation is neglected the field does not have independent degrees of freedom , but is determined by particle positions and velocities . using the non - relativistic form for the kinetic energy one",
    "then gets , @xmath24 where , @xmath25 and @xmath26 } { 2c|{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}-{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}_i| } .\\ ] ] here the position and velocity vectors of the particles are @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , @xmath29 and @xmath30 their masses and charges , and @xmath31 ( darwin @xcite , jackson @xcite , schwinger _",
    "@xcite , essn @xcite ) .",
    "the vector potential here is in the coulomb gauge , and this essentially means that all velocity dependence of the interaction appears in the magnetic part , leaving the coulomb interaction energy in its static form .",
    "when the expressions ( [ eq.coul.pot ] ) and ( [ eq.darwin.a.ito.velocity ] ) are inserted into equation ( [ eq.ltotnorad2 ] ) one finds infinite contributions from self - interactions . when these are discarded , so that each particle only interacts with the field from the others , one obtains @xmath32}{2c^2 } - \\sum_{i < j}\\frac{q_i q_j}{r_{ij}},\\ ] ] where now @xmath33 is the distance between particles @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the unit vector pointing from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "this is the so called darwin lagrangian @xcite for the system .",
    "we can write it , @xmath37 where , @xmath14 , is kinetic energy and , @xmath38 , the coulomb electric interaction energy . the magnetic part can also be written @xmath39 here it is important the the vector potential is divergence free ( @xmath40 , coulomb gauge ) .",
    "the darwin lagrangian thus includes both electric and magnetic interactions between the particles and is valid in when radiation can be neglected .",
    "the coulomb interaction , @xmath38 , between two overlapping charged spheres is calculated in appendix [ app.coul ] .",
    "the magnetic interaction between two charged spheres in relative translational motion is calculated in appendix [ app.mag.transl ] for the case of small displacement of centers of the spheres ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "keeping only the quadratic term , one finds , @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the vector to center of the positive sphere from the center of the negative , so that @xmath44 . the center of mass motion decouples , and we assume that the random motions decouple .",
    "this is then the relevant lagrangian for the relative collective translation .",
    "it can be written , @xmath45 where , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "if we assume a proton - electron plasma we get @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . on the right hand side",
    "we have introduced , @xmath52 , the classical electron radius .",
    "note that when @xmath53 the effective mass @xmath54 is entirely due to inductive inertia .",
    "clearly the lagrangian ( [ eq.lagr.transl.rel ] ) corresponds to an oscillating system with angular frequency @xmath55 . for this frequency",
    "we get explicitly , @xmath56 if we introduce the dimensionless number , @xmath57 we see that for @xmath58 , one obtains , essentially , the langmuir plasma frequency , @xmath59 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq.plasma.freq ] ) . if we reexpress the plasma frequency in terms of the classical electron radius @xcite , eq.([eq.freq.sq ] )",
    "can be written in the form , @xmath60 thus , when the number of particles is large enough so that @xmath61 , this gives , @xmath62 for this case the frequency turns out to depend on the size ( radius ) of the sphere , but not on the density .",
    "we now study pure rotational motion of the two charged spheres , about their coinciding centers of mass , but we include interaction , @xmath63 with a constant external magnetic field @xmath64 . here @xmath65 is the vector potential of the external field . starting from ( [ eq.collective.transformed ] ) and ( [ eq.parts.l.darwin ] ) we find that , @xmath66 is the relevant lagrangian for collective relative rotation .",
    "the explicit calculations are sketched in appendix [ app.mag.int.rot ] .",
    "one finds that @xmath67 and that this term therefore contributes to the effective moment of inertia , just as it contributed to the effective mass , @xmath54 , in the translational case .",
    "the result can be written , @xmath68 where , @xmath69 we see that when @xmath70 we can neglect the contribution from mass to the effective moment of inertia @xmath71 . in this limit therefore , @xmath72 and there is essentially only inductive moment of inertia .",
    "we assume this below .",
    "in order to investigate the equation of motion we put @xmath73 and @xmath74 . the lagrangian then becomes @xmath75 in general when , @xmath76 , one finds that , @xmath77 . in our case",
    "this gives , @xmath78 if we assume that @xmath79 when @xmath80 we find that the constant is zero : @xmath81 . at all times",
    "we then find the relation , @xmath82 between angular velocity and the magnetic field .    to get the energy from @xmath83 one calculates the hamiltonian @xmath84 . for the @xmath85 of eq .",
    "( [ eq.rot.lagrange.expl.z ] ) one finds , @xmath86 let us consider two special cases of this phase space energy of the plasma .",
    "we first assume that the external field is zero ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the energy is then given by @xmath88 .",
    "here @xmath89 is the angular momentum of relative rotation . for a given value of this angular momentum",
    "the energy is thus much smaller when @xmath90 than otherwise .",
    "this reflects the fact , repeatedly stressed by the author @xcite , that for given momenta the phase space energy of a plasma is lower when there is net current than in the absence of net current .",
    "now consider instead the case @xmath81 . for simplicity",
    "we also assume @xmath91 .",
    "one then finds that @xmath92 or , equivalently , using ( [ eq.eff.mom.of.inert.induc ] ) , that the energy as function of @xmath93 is given by , @xmath94 note that here , @xmath95 , is the energy density of the field @xmath93 in our ( gaussian ) units . the energy is thus seen to grow quadratically with the applied magnetic field and our plasma spheres are strongly diamagnetic .",
    "based on more detailed studies cole @xcite has also concluded that plasmas are diamagnetic . in our model plasma diamagnetism",
    "is seen to be closely related to the diamagnetism of superconductors , as discussed by essn @xcite : the external field induces a current that screens the external field and reduces it inside . in the absence of resistance",
    "this screening current persists .",
    "resistivity is completely neglected in the present model .",
    "it has been pointed out by kulsrud @xcite , in his book on astrophysical plasmas , that the negligible resistivity of such plasmas is in fact closely connected with magnetic induction . in the present treatment magnetic",
    "induction appears in the form of an inductive inertia that appears naturally as the main physical parameter in the present model .",
    "as early as 1933 frenkel @xcite suggested that superconductivity is due to inductive inertia .",
    "frenkel also conjectured that inductive inertia can lower the energy and cause a phase transition .",
    "he did not , however , make his ideas quantitative .",
    "the present model system gives frenkel s ideas some quantitative backing .",
    "we note that for a collective momentum @xmath96 involving @xmath97 particles the kinetic energy will be @xmath98 , when magnetic interaction is neglected , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq.lagr.transl.rel ] -[eq.eff.inert.mass ] ) .",
    "when the effect of magnetic interaction is included this becomes @xmath99)$ ] and we find that @xmath100 when @xmath90 , assuming that @xmath96 remains constant .",
    "collective modes are thus much more favorable thermodynamically when there is net current .",
    "plasma resistivity is normally treated by studying the scattering of individual charged particles .",
    "even with this type of treatment fast electrons become , so called , runaway electrons and experience no resistance @xcite .",
    "the present model indicates that resistivity can not be treated as resulting from the scattering of individual particles , since the collective motion of many charges leads to a large inductive non - local effect .",
    "all this points in the same direction , namely that plasmas need not be resistive , in agreement with our model treatment .",
    "if resistivity had to be included the translational oscillation would become a damped oscillation and any circulating current would eventually cease , thereby making the diamagnetic response temporary .",
    "a more immediate limitation of our model is probably the fact that a current would cause pinching and this would lead to instabilities that deform of the spherical shape .",
    "lynden - bell @xcite has studied the relativistically spinning charged sphere and finds that charge concentrates near the equator ( as a result of pinching ) .",
    "the model treated in this article is not particularly realistic .",
    "instead it can be motivated as the simplest possible model within which one can study plasma phenomena associated with current , induction , and magnetic interaction energy , in a meaningful way .",
    "hopefully it also has some novelty . in the literature one can find a fair amount of work on the radially oscillating plasma sphere ( see e.g. barnes and nebel @xcite , park _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , but not the modes treated here . a numerical study of a rotating convective plasma sphere , modelling a star , by dobler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows how complicated more realistic models necessarily become .",
    "the two - sphere model studied here is therefore valuable as a device for gaining insight into some very basic plasma phenomena .",
    "as we have seen the most basic of these is the dominance of inductive inertia in the effective mass @xmath54 of eq.([eq.eff.inert.mass ] ) , and the effective moment of inertia @xmath101 of eq .",
    "( [ eq.eff.mom.of.inert ] ) , when the number @xmath97 of participating charged particles is large enough .",
    "one notes that @xmath102 for a typical laboratory plasma of density @xmath103 and of radius @xmath104 cm , assuming that all particles contribute to the collective mode .",
    "finally the model also indicates how this large inductive inertia influences the energy of the plasma and how a plasma responds diamagnetically to an external magnetic field .",
