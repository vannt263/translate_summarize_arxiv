    "for the majority of the problems in physics no exact analytical solution is known and it is a common procedure to resort to perturbation theory ( pt )  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental idea behind perturbation theory is that , if a given problem is solvable for a particular value of a parameter , then one can obtain analytical approximations to the solution in a close neighborhood of this value , by taylor expanding in that parameter .",
    "calling @xmath2 this parameter and @xmath3 the value for which an exact analytical solution is known , then the results obtained with perturbation theory will be , to a given order , polynomials in @xmath4 .",
    "the perturbative series obtained by considering all the terms of the expansion will in general have a finite radius of convergence , @xmath5 , which in some cases could even be zero and therefore the series would be divergent for all @xmath6 .",
    "actually divergent series are usually expected from the application of pt to quantum field theory , as first observed by dyson in the case of quantum electrodynamics ( qed)@xcite . another well  known example of divergent series is given by the quantum anharmonic oscillator , whose perturbative coefficients for the energy of the ground state have been calculated by bender and wu in @xcite and proved to have a factorial growth .",
    "although the pertubative series provide in many cases the only systematic approach to the solution of a problem , they are not always useful , since they are confined to a restricted region for the physical parameters , @xmath7 . outside this region",
    ", the physics becomes _ nonperturbative _ and can not be described directly in terms of the original series .",
    "for quite a long time physicists have been interested into finding a bridge from the perturbative to the non  perturbative region .",
    "several methods have been developed which allow to extract the non  perturbative behavior from the perturbative series : among such methods we would like to mention the borel and pad approximants@xcite and nonlinear transformations @xcite .",
    "methods which are alternative to pt should retain on one hand the ability to provide a sistematic analytical approximation to a given problem , and on the other hand they should remain valid even in the nonperturbative region , never leading to divergent series . over the years new ideas",
    "have allowed to devise methods which comply with these requirements .",
    "the linear delta expansion ( lde ) @xcite and the variational perturbation theory ( vpt ) @xcite are two examples of non  perturbative methods . roughly speaking these methods work by introducing in a problem an artificial parameter and turn the original problem into a new one with a modified perturbation .",
    "the optimization of the `` perturbative '' results to a given order with respect to the artificial parameter is usually obtained through the _ principle of minimal sensitivity _",
    "( pms)@xcite and leads to expressions which are non  polynomials in the physical parameters and therefore non  perturbative .    in this paper",
    "we will explore a new a path , which is also described in shorter letter : the method that we have devised , which we have called parametric perturbation theory ( ppt ) method , is based on few simple ideas .",
    "the first one , which we will refer to as _ principle of absolute simplicity _ ( pas ) , is that we do not want to calculate the observable ( energy , frequency , etc . ) directly as a polynomial in the physical coupling @xmath2 , as done in pt , but that this observable should have the simplest possible form ( linear ) in a given unphysical parameter @xmath8 ; the second idea is that the perturbation theory must be carried out in @xmath8 and that the functional relation @xmath9 must comply with the principle of absolute simplicity to the order to which the calculation is done .",
    "this will allow to determine the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath10 and in turn to obtain the observable as a parametric function of @xmath8 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we develop the parametric perturbation theory for a problem of nonlinear oscillations in classical mechanics and show that at finite order it provides extremely accurate approximations for the frequencies and for the solutions of the problem ; in section [ sec2 ] we show that the ppt approach can be applied directly on the perturbative series and discuss the performance of our method in the case of non trivial examples , with divergent perturbative series .",
    "finally , in section [ concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "consider a model which depends on a parameter @xmath2 , and which is solvable when @xmath11 .",
    "the application of pt to this problem to a finite order yields a polynomial in @xmath2 . calling @xmath5 the radius of convergence of the perturbative series",
    ", the direct use of pt must be restricted to @xmath12 , as previously discussed . however , the misbehavior of the perturbative series for a physical observable @xmath13 is the result of having expanded in a parameter , @xmath2 , which is not optimal .",
    "if one knew the exact solution to the problem , i.e. @xmath14 , then this solution could be considered as a polynomial of order one in the variable @xmath15 .",
    "although this observation by itself can not be used as a constructive principle , we may adopt the philosophy that the _ perturbative series for the observable can be simpler and convergent in all the domain , if it is cast in terms of a suitable parameter @xmath8_.    only if such parameter , by luck or ability , turns out to be the @xmath15 discussed above , the exact solution is obtained .",
    "the goal , therefore , is to progressively build this parameter @xmath8 to yield an expression for @xmath13 as simple as possible . in this framework",
    "the perturbative expansion is carried out in @xmath8 and all the physical quantities in the problem are expressed as functions of @xmath8 . in particular we have now that @xmath9 .",
    "while the ordinary perturbation theory works by calculating the contributions to higher orders in @xmath2 , each term of higher order refining the result to lower order , the approach approach is the opposite : we carry out a perturbative calculation in @xmath8 , and then determine order by order the form of @xmath9 so that the observable @xmath16 can be a order one polynomial in @xmath8 .",
    "this is in essence the _ principle of absolute simplicity_.    having given the general ideas of the method we proceed to examine its implementation in a concrete problem .",
    "we consider the classical nonlinear oscillations of a point mass described by the equation ( duffing equation ) @xmath17    the lindstedt - poincar method can be used to obtain a perturbative expansion of the squared frequency @xmath18 of the oscillations in powers of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the method works by defining an absolute time scale , independent of @xmath2 and by then fixing the coefficients of the expansion of @xmath18 so that the secular terms in the expansion are eliminated at each order . working through order @xmath19",
    "one finds @xmath20 \\ , \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] @xmath21 being the amplitude of oscillations . ] .",
    "we now proceed to implement our method .",
    "the first step is to define a functional relation between @xmath2 and the perturbative parameter of the expansion , @xmath8 .",
    "for example , we choose @xmath22 where the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 are unknown constants to be later determined .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 is related to the order to which the calculation is performed , since the number of coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 needs to match the number of conditions available at a given order .",
    "the reader may wonder the reason of the particular choice made in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) : the functional relation between @xmath2 and @xmath8 can be more general than eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , although it is not completely arbitrary since it must reproduce all the terms in the perturbative expansion when the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath8 is inverted .",
    "the choice made here takes into account this fact and also the leading asymptotic behavior of the frequency , @xmath28 . )",
    "does not have zeroes for @xmath29 and that therefore @xmath30 is reached for @xmath31 . ]",
    "we now follow the standard procedure of the lp method and introduce an absolute time @xmath32 . applying the pas we choose this relation to be @xmath33 where @xmath34 are coefficients to be determined .",
    "we also expand the solution as @xmath35    the reader familiar with the lp method will recognize the profoundly different character of the present approach : in the lp method the observable , i.e. @xmath18 , is expressed as a series in powers of @xmath2 , whose coefficients are determined by the condition that secular terms are eliminated at each order ; here we impose that @xmath18 has the simplest possible form when expressed in terms of @xmath8 , and we let @xmath36 to contain arbitrary powers of @xmath8 . in detail , we transform the original equation into the new equation @xmath37    for sake of simplicity we will limit ourselves to work through order @xmath38 and solve the differential equations resulting at each order in @xmath8 .",
    "the elimination of the secular term to order one yields @xmath39 , as in standard lp method ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the solutions to order @xmath41 and @xmath42 are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the elimination of the secular term to second order provides the condition @xmath45 and the solution @xmath46    , calculated to order 3,5 and 7 ( solid , dashed and dot - dashed curves ) ; right panel : error over the first two fourier coefficients calculated to order 3 using ppt and the lde approach of @xcite.,width=529 ]    finally , one can determine @xmath47 to cancel the secular term to third order , @xmath48 , and correspondingly @xmath49 .",
    "the solution to third order thus reads @xmath50    to order @xmath38 we therefore find @xmath51 which can be inverted and used to express the frequency directly in terms of @xmath2 : @xmath52    notice that this expression is non  perturbative in @xmath53 and that it provides a maximum error @xmath54 .",
    "this error is much smaller that then the one obtained to third order in @xcite using the linear delta expansion , i.e. @xmath55 ( in which case one has @xmath56 ) .    at the same time",
    "ppt provides highly accurate estimates for the fourier coefficients of the solution , @xmath23 . in the right panel of fig.[fig_1 ] we have plotted the error defined as @xmath57 as function of @xmath2 and compared our results with the already excellent results of @xcite .    at this point",
    "the reader should recognize that , if one is interested only in frequency and not in the solution , it is possible to determine the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 to a given order with a minimal effort directly from the coefficients of the perturbative series .",
    "the procedure consists of first substituting @xmath58 inside the perturbative series , and then expanding around @xmath59 : the unknown coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 are then used to suppress the nonlinear behavior in @xmath8 inside @xmath18 . following this simple procedure",
    "we have produced the result to order @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the left panel of fig.[fig_1 ] .",
    "in many cases the perturbative results for a given problem are known only to a finite order since the calculation of each higher order involves increasing technical difficulties .",
    "for example , the calculation of observables in quantum field theory at a given order in pt requires to take into account a number of feynman diagrams which rapidly grows with the order of the perturbation , the calculation of the higher order ( multiloop ) diagrams being more and more challenging .    for this reason it is desirable to have a procedure which",
    ", using only a finite number of perturbative coefficients , may extract the essential physical behavior of the solution and possibly predict a number of unknown perturbative coefficients .",
