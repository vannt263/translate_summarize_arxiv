    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) is by now well established from astrophysical observations @xcite .",
    "together with the recent wmap results , the cosmological observations have shown that the present universe consists of about 73% dark energy , 23% dark matter , and 4% baryonic matter  @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , there is no cold dm candidate .",
    "therefore , one has to extend the sm to account for the existence of dm . the dm candidate is often accompanied by some discrete symmetries to keep it stable , such as the r parity in supersymmetric ( susy ) models and kk parity in universal extra dimension models .",
    "although the discrete symmetries are necessary for the dm stability , they may be introduced from different motivations  @xcite .    in the left - right ( lr ) symmetric gauge model @xcite with spontaneous @xmath1 violation ( scpv ) , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 symmetries are exact before the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) . in this case , it is possible that the discrete symmetries @xmath0 and @xmath1 strongly constrain the scalar sector of the model and naturally give stable dm candidates .",
    "this possibility has not been emphasized in the literature , due to the fact that most of the popular models such as sm and susy violate @xmath0 maximally . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 symmetries can give a stable dm candidate in an extension of a left - right symmetric gauge model with a singlet scalar field @xmath2 . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath1 odd particle @xmath3 is stable even after the ssb , provided that it does not develop vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .    without large fine - tuning , it is difficult to have a successful scpv in the minimal left - right symmetric gauge model with only one higgs bidoublet ( 1hbdm ) @xcite .",
    "this is because in the decoupling limit the predicted @xmath1 violating quantity @xmath4 with @xmath5 being a @xmath1 phase angle in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is far below the experimentally measured value of @xmath6 from the two b - factories @xcite .",
    "in addition , the 1hbdm is also subject to strong phenomenological constraints from low energy flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes , especially the neutral kaon mixing which pushes the masses of the right - handed gauge bosons and some neutral higgs bosons much above the tev scale @xcite .",
    "motivated by the requirement of both spontaneous @xmath0 and @xmath1 violations , we have considered the left - right symmetric gauge model with two higgs bidoublets ( 2hbdm ) @xcite . in the 2hbdm ,",
    "the additional higgs bidoublet modifies the higgs potential so that the fine - tuning problem in the scpv can be avoided , and the bounds from the fcnc processes can be relaxed .",
    "the extra higgs bidoublet may also change the interferences among different contributions in the neutral meson mixings , and lower the bounds for the right - handed gauge boson masses not to be much higher than the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "such a right - handed gauge boson can be searched at the lhc using the angular distributions of top quarks and the leptons from top quark decays @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the discrete symmetries @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be used to stabilize the dm candidate @xmath3 in the 1hbdm and 2hbdm with the scpv . using the observed dm abundance , we can constrain the parameter space and predict the spin - independent ( si ) dm - nucleon elastic scattering cross section . for simplicity ,",
    "we have only considered the case with no mixing among light neutral higgs bosons in the 2hbdm and the dark matter is heavy . in this paper",
    ", we shall demonstrate in detail the mixing effect on the dm direct detection .",
    "notice that several new dm annihilation channels can be derived , namely two dm particles may annihilate into a gauge boson and a higgs boson . on the other hand , we are going to extend the dm mass range from @xmath7 gev to @xmath8 gev . as a consequence",
    ", one will meet several resonances in the 2hbdm .",
    "therefore we shall consider the breit - wigner resonance effect for the determination of the dm relic density @xcite .",
