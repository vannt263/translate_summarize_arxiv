    "though , the precise physical processes that lead to coronal heating and the subsequent acceleration of the solar wind are not known . at the coronal base ,",
    "different combinations of mechanisms ( e.g. , magnetic reconnection , turbulence , wave dissipation , and plasma instabilities ) are probably responsible for the varied appearance of coronal holes , quiet regions , loops , and x - ray bright points ( priest et al .   2000 ) . in the open magnetic flux tubes that feed the solar wind , additional heating at heliocentric distances greater than about 2 solar radii ( @xmath1 ) is believed to be needed ( e.g. , leer , holzer , & fl 1982 ; parker 1991 ) .",
    "this paper investigates the consequences of a promising mechanism for extended coronal heating : the kinetic dissipation of driven magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence in the strong background magnetic field of the accelerating solar wind .",
    "the necessity for gradual energy deposition at large distances from the coronal base comes from three sets of empirical constraints ( see also cranmer 2002 ) .",
    "first , pressure - driven models of the high - speed component ( @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 ) of the solar wind can not be made consistent with the relatively low inferred electron temperatures in coronal holes ( @xmath4 k ) without additional energy or momentum deposition .",
    "second , spacecraft in the interplanetary medium have measured radial gradients in proton and electron temperatures that are substantially shallower than predicted from pure adiabatic expansion ( phillips et al .   1995 ; richardson et al .",
    "similar measurements of radial growth of the proton magnetic moment between the orbits of mercury and the earth ( schwartz & marsch 1983 ; marsch 1991 ) point to specific forms of gradual energy addition .",
    "third , the ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer ( uvcs ) aboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ) measured extremely high heavy ion temperatures , faster bulk ion outflow compared to protons , and strong anisotropies ( with @xmath5 ) in ion velocity distributions in the extended corona ( kohl et al .   1997 , 1998 , 1999 ; noci et al .",

    "the list of possible physical processes responsible for extended coronal heating is limited severely by the fact that coulomb collisions are extremely weak above 2 to 3 @xmath1 and that ions receive more energy than electrons ( with @xmath6 ) .",
    "also , most suggested mechanisms involve the transfer of energy from propagating fluctuations  such as waves , shocks , or turbulent eddies  to the particles .",
    "this broad consensus has arisen because the ultimate source of energy must be solar in origin , and thus it must somehow be transmitted out to the distances where the heating occurs ( see , e.g. , hollweg 1978 ; tu & marsch 1995 ) .",
    "the most common wave damping mechanisms proposed for the coronal base ( resistivity , viscosity , and thermal conductivity ) seem to be ruled out in the extended corona because of the relative unimportance of collisions .",
    "wave - particle interactions are natural alternatives to collisional processes and have been studied in a solar wind context for several decades ( barnes 1968 ; toichi 1971 ; abraham - shrauner & feldman 1977 ; hollweg & turner 1978 ; marsch , goertz , & richter 1982 ; isenberg & hollweg 1983 ; hollweg 1986 ; tu 1987 , 1988 ; axford & mckenzie 1992 ) .",

    "thus , any wave generation mechanism seems to require bridging a gap of many orders of magnitude in frequency or wavenumber .",
    "axford & mckenzie ( 1992 ) suggested that high - frequency alfvn waves could be generated during small - scale reconnection events in the rapidly evolving supergranular network .",
    "these waves would propagate up through the corona until they reach the cyclotron resonance radii of various ions , then damp over a very short distance ( see also schwartz , feldman , & gary 1981 ) .",
    "tu & marsch ( 1997 ) and marsch & tu ( 1997 ) presented solar wind models based on the idea that a launched power spectrum becomes `` swept up '' and eroded by the slow radial decrease of the cyclotron frequency .",

    "conclusions , remaining questions , and implications for future spectroscopic observations are summarized in   5 .",
    "in this section we derive the fourier power spectrum of turbulent alfvnic fluctuations as a function of the wavevector @xmath9 in the low plasma - beta extended corona .",
    "we assume that the turbulence is driven at large scales by waves that originate at the sun , and that some process ( such as reflection ) generates inward - propagating waves to excite a cascade ( matthaeus et al .",
    ". the precise generation mechanisms of the low - frequency waves at the solar surface are unimportant in the context of this paper ( see , e.g. , roberts 2000 ) .",
    "the outward - propagating waves enter the corona and transform , in part , to a mixed population of outward and inward modes .",
    "only when inward and outward wave packets are allowed to `` collide '' can nonlinear couplings to higher wavenumber occur . the resulting cascade is a time - steady transfer of energy from large to small spatial scales that is believed to progress by successive magnetic reconnection in the presence of the strong coronal `` guide field '' ( e.g. , matthaeus & lamkin 1986 ; lazarian & vishniac 1999 ) .",
    "we assume that the turbulence becomes fully developed on time scales that are short compared to the bulk solar wind outflow and the geometrical expansion of open flux tubes .",
    "this allows us to model the turbulence as spatially homogeneous in a small volume element ( with constant density and magnetic field strength ) in the extended corona .",
    "the energy density of fluctuations in a magnetized plasma is described most generally as a sum of electric , magnetic , and kinetic components . for linear ( i.e. , small amplitude ) fluctuations ,",
    "the total fluctuation energy density @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 @xmath12 where angle brackets denote averages over times much longer than the fluctuation time scales , @xmath13 is the perturbed electric field , and @xmath14 is the perturbed magnetic field ( e.g. , bernstein 1958 ) .",

    "we assume a fully ionized plasma composed only of protons and electrons ( see   5 for a discussion of the impact of heavy ions ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 above is constructed as the simplest second - order and positive - definite quantity that is conserved exactly as a consequence of the fully nonlinear vlasov equation ( davidson 1983 ) .    if the zero - order proton and electron velocity distributions are assumed to be maxwellian , the kinetic energy density term in eq .",

    "this population of waves is expected to be mostly propagating upwards from the sun , with a radial amplitude dependence close to that predicted by the conservation of wave action ( hollweg 1973 ; jacques 1977 ; banerjee et al .",

    "the energy density spectra defined above are appropriate for following the flow of the _ total _ energy in wavenumber space , but they do not necessarily track the dominant turbulent motions on all spatial scales .",
    "one important example is the case of large-@xmath38 kinetic alfvn waves ( kaw ) that have wavelengths larger than the mean electron larmor radius but smaller than the mean proton larmor radius .",
    "these fluctuations are `` felt '' by all electrons in a similar manner as longer - wavelength mhd waves . however , some protons execute larmor gyrations on a spatial scale larger than that of the fluctuations , and thus they become uncoupled from the waves .",

    "however , we do not include high - frequency ( proton cyclotron ) dispersive effects in the cascade term , even though we do include them in the dissipation term .",
    "such effects in the cascade term are expected to be negligible because of the very limited extent of the `` dispersion range '' in @xmath36 ( see the closely - spaced solid contours in figure 4a , below ) .",

    "a substantial amount of power at the cyclotron frequencies of positive ions would lead to significant preferential ion heating .",
    "let us model the spectral transport in @xmath36 with a diffusion term similar to that assumed above .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that the actual parallel transport is probably _ nonlocal _ in wavenumber space ( due to , e.g. , intermittent high - order wave - wave interactions and nonlinear steepening ; see medvedev 2000 ) and thus should not be describable by local diffusion .",
