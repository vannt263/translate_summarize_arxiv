    "@xcite studied the following special case tsp(@xmath8 ) of the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) which is specified by an integer @xmath16 and a real number @xmath17 .",
    "the cities are @xmath18 points in @xmath19-dimensional space @xmath1 , and the distance between two points @xmath6 and @xmath7 is @xmath20 , where @xmath5 denotes the standard euclidean distance between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    *",
    "the objective in problem tsp(@xmath8 ) is to find a shortest tour ( under distances @xmath21 ) that visits every city _ exactly _ once .",
    "* in the closely related problem rev - tsp@xmath22 , the objective is to find a shortest tour that visits every city _ at least _ once ; thus the salesman is allowed to revisit cities .",
    "note that tsp@xmath23 is the classical two - dimensional euclidean tspand that tsp@xmath24 is the so - called _ bottleneck tsp _ in @xmath1 , where the goal is to find a tour whose longest edge has minimum length .",
    "we are , however , mainly interested in the case where @xmath25 is some small constant , and we will not touch the case @xmath26 .

    "a crucial property of the euclidean tsp is that the underlying euclidean distances satisfy the triangle inequality .",
    "the triangle inequality implies that no reasonable salesman would ever revisit the same city : instead of returning to a city , it is always cheaper to skip the city and to travel directly to the successor city .",
    "all positive approximation results for the euclidean tsp rely heavily on the triangle inequality . in strong contrast to this , for exponents @xmath15 the distance function @xmath21 does not satisfy the triangle inequality .",
    "thus the combinatorial structure of the problem changes significantly  for example , revisits may suddenly become helpful  and the existing approximation algorithms for euclidean tsp can not be applied .",
    "another nice property of the classical euclidean problem tsp@xmath23 is that , sloppily speaking , instances with many cities have long optimal tours .",
    "consider for instance a set @xmath0 of @xmath18 points in the unit square .",
    "then there exists a tour whose euclidean length is bounded by @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "this bound is essentially tight since there are point sets for which _ every _ tour has euclidean length @xmath31 .",
    "interestingly , these results do not carry over to tsp@xmath32 with _ squared _ euclidean distances .",
    "problem # 124 in the book by bollobs  @xcite shows that there always exists a tour for @xmath0 such that the sum of the squared euclidean distances is bounded by  @xmath33 , and that this bound of  @xmath33 is best possible .",
    "since , as a rule of thumb , large objective values are easier to approximate than small objective values , this already indicates a substantial difference in the approximability behaviors of tsp(2,1 ) and tsp(2,2 ) .",

    "we will demonstrate in section  [ sec : tspalpha ] that essentially _ every _ variant of the original @xmath48-algorithm by andreae and bandelt  @xcite already gives a @xmath49-approximation for tsp@xmath22 .",
    "the bottom - line of all this , and the actual starting point of our paper , is that the machinery around the @xmath34-relaxed triangle inequality only yields a bound of roughly @xmath50 .",
    "this raises the following questions : how much can geometry help us in getting even better approximation ratios ?",
    "can we beat the 6-approximation for tsp@xmath32 of funke et al . ?",

( b )  does allowing revisits change the complexity or the approximability of the problem ? as we know , classical euclidean tsp  ( that is , tsp@xmath53 ) is np - hard  @xcite and has a polynomial - time approximation scheme ( ptas ) in any fixed number  @xmath19 of dimensions  @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "we were surprised that the apx - hardness proof , too , carried over to tsp@xmath54 for all @xmath15 .",

    "the nodes are modeled as points in the plane , and every node can communicate with all other nodes that are within its transmission radius .",
    "the power ( that is , the energy ) needed to achieve a transmission radius of @xmath56 is roughly proportional to @xmath57 for some real parameter @xmath25 called the _ distance - power gradient_. depending on environmental conditions , @xmath25 typically is in the range 2  to  6  ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite suggest that it is useful to have a tour through the network , which can be used to pass a _ virtual token _ around .",

    "another setting related to tsp@xmath12 is the following . instead of omni - directional antennas ,",

    "@xcite assume that a node can communicate with other nodes in a circular sector of a given angle ( where the sector s radius is still determined by the power of the node s signal ) .",
    "for directional antennas one not only has to assign a power level to each node , but also has to decide on the direction in which each node transmits .",
    "if the opening angle tends to zero and the points are in general position , a strongly connected network becomes a tour .",

    "andreae and bandelt  @xcite gave an approximation algorithm for @xmath37-tsp .",
    "their @xmath48-algorithm is an adaptation of the well - known double - spanning - tree heuristic for tsp .",
    "this heuristic finds a minimum spanning tree ( mst ) in the given graph  @xmath66 , doubles all edges , finds an euler tour in the resulting multigraph , and finally constructs a hamiltonian cycle from the euler tour by skipping all nodes that have already been visited .",
    "the weight of the mst is a lower bound for the length of a tsp - tour since removing any edge from a tour yields a spanning tree whose weight is at least the weight of the mst .",
    "note that this statement holds for arbitrary weight functions .",
    "if the triangle inequality holds , the heuristic yields a 2-approximation since then skipping over visited nodes never increases the length of the tour , which initially equals twice the weight of the mst . for the weight function  @xmath21 , however , the heuristic can perform arbitrarily badly  consider a sequence of @xmath18 equally - spaced points on a line .",
    "the @xmath48-algorithm of andreae and bandelt also creates a hamiltonian tour by shortcutting the mst , but their algorithm never skips more than two consecutive nodes .",
