    "quasars located at high redshifts provide excellent probes of the intervening universe .",
    "as their light travels through the universe , it is partially absorbed by neutral hydrogen or metals such as magnesium  an effect detectable in the quasars optical and uv spectra .",
    "these absorption lines provide an effective way of probing the evolution of metal - bearing gas over a large range of redshifts , as the sensitivity to absorption is largely independent of redshift , depending only on the background source s surface brightness .",
    "the  absorption systems in particular are most likely associated with foreground galaxies @xcite , based on the velocity structure within the systems , the clustering properties of the absorbers , and the presence of metals that have most likely been produced locally .",
    "when identified , most of these galaxies appear to be spirals ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although absorbers have been found that span the range from late - type spirals to galaxies resembling present - day ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the observational challenge then is to correctly identify the absorbing galaxies and build up a picture of the absorbing system .",
    "such identifications allow one to track the evolution of metal - bearing gas and its relationship to galactic environment .",
    "the identification of the object responsible for an absorption system involves finding a galaxy close to the line - of - sight to the quasar that has a redshift matching that of the absorption system .",
    "as such galaxies are often faint , to examine many in the vicinity of a given quasar requires relatively large amounts of telescope time , or a large degree of multiplexing .",
    "the advent of multi - object spectrographs on large telescopes has enabled more systems and galaxies to be examined , greatly assisting the identification of absorbing systems .",
    "the identification of nearby galaxies close on the sky to a high - redshift quasar also allows us to address the question of gravitational lensing .",
    "the high redshifts of these quasars on face value imply very large luminosities , placing them at the high end of the luminosity function , where the slope of the function is steepest .",
    "if a small amount of magnification due to gravitational lensing is taking place , the intrinsic luminosity of the quasar will be reduced , changing the shape of the luminosity function .",
    "this is particularly important for the highest redshift quasars ( such as those at @xmath2 , e.g.  @xcite ) , but also for those around @xmath3 .",
    "in this paper we address these issues by targeting pks 2126@xmath0158 , a luminous high - redshift quasar that exhibits a number of metal - line absorption systems and has a large number of galaxies close to its line of sight , using the multiplexing capabilities of gmos on the gemini south telescope .",
    "we use imaging and low - resolution spectroscopy to obtain redshifts for many of the galaxies in the field , focussing on the @xmath4 environment .",
    "we describe this quasar and our observations of it and the surrounding field in section  [ sec - obs ] , while the results of the gemini / gmos observations are presented in section  [ sec - results ] .",
    "the implications of these results for the absorption line systems seen in the quasar s spectrum are discussed in section  [ sec - absn ] , and the possibility of magnification of this quasar due to gravitational lensing is discussed in section  [ sec - lens ] . a summary of the results is found in section  [ sec - summary ] . note that throughout this paper we assume a standard @xmath5cdm cosmology , with @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the quasar pks 2126@xmath0158  is a radio - loud , flat - spectrum quasar at a redshift of @xmath9 .",
    "it was first identified by @xcite in optical follow - up of flat - spectrum sources from the parkes 2700 mhz surveys , and at the time its redshift was measured it was only the fifth radio quasar with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "pks 2126@xmath0158  is known to be a very bright object at radio ( @xmath11 , @xcite ) , optical / near - infrared ( @xmath12 , @xcite ) and x - ray ( @xmath13 , @xcite ) frequencies .",
    "these fluxes , combined with its relatively high redshift , mean it is among the most luminous quasars known .",
    "the optical / near - infrared spectrum of pks 2126@xmath0158  has a blue power - law shape for wavelengths longer than @xmath14 band @xcite , where the ly@xmath15  line falls .",
    "the flux drops off at shorter wavelengths due to absorption by the intervening gas of the lyman alpha forest .",
    "absorption systems with strong metal lines are observed at the redshifts indicated in table  [ tab - lines ] .",
    "the relatively strong  system at @xmath16 is particularly relevant for this paper , and is discussed in more detail in section  [ sec - abssystem ] .",
    "the peculiar concentration of objects in the vicinity of pks 2126@xmath0158  was first noticed from @xmath17-band images taken on 6 june 1993 by @xcite with iris @xcite on the anglo - australian telescope in the course of identification of sources in the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phfs ) .",
    "there are @xmath18 sources visible within 30 arcsec of the quasar , principally toward the east and south .",
    "@xcite obtained spectra of the two bright sources to the west ( designated therein as c1 and c2 , at distances of @xmath19 and @xmath20 arcsec west of the quasar respectively ) .",
    "they were able to measure the redshift of c2 ( an emission line galaxy ) as @xmath21 , while the spectrum of c1 was inconclusive .",

    "# 17 , # 18 , # 19 and # 20  as well as # 14 , which is just close enough to be considered associated , we get @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this velocity dispersion is characteristic of a group environment , rather than a more dense cluster environment which would show @xmath29 .",
    "it is , in fact , a relatively poor group , with only five members brighter than @xmath30 .",
    "there are at least four fainter galaxies for which we have not obtained spectra that are also candidates for inclusion in the group ( see sec .",
    "[ sec - absn ] for further discussion ) .",
    "the remaining galaxies at @xmath1 ( # 24 , # 03 and # 01 ) are part of the same large - scale structure that the group is embedded in , but not necessarily directly associated with the group itself .",
    "in addition to this structure , we find several other features in redshift - space .",
    "there are two other main structures seen in the field , at @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( and possibly @xmath33 ) , although these are not as tightly grouped on the sky as the main group at @xmath1 .",
    "there are a number of field galaxies at other redshifts as well .",
    "we are thus seeing several features in the large - scale structure along the line - of - sight to pks 2126@xmath0158 .",

    "[ fig - spectra - hi ]  &  [ fig - spectra - lo ] , and the distribution of galaxy redshifts can be seen in fig  [ fig - zdist ] .    of the remainder , six objects were identified as stars , and a further five had spectra of too low quality for a redshift measurement . of these latter objects ,",
    "two ( # 11 and # 15 ) have extended morphologies in the @xmath22 gmos image , and @xmath34 colours redder than all the confirmed group members ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , cf.@xmath37 for the group members ) .",
    "they are thus either red galaxies in the @xmath1 group ( more likely in the case of # 15 ) , or background galaxies ( and redder due to their greater redshift ) .",
    "as seen in section  [ sec - results ] , we find a concentration of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath24 .",
    "this coincides in redshift - space with a metal - line absorption system detected by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the system consists of four components in velocity , with three species detected   and , plus  in the two highest column density components .",
    "the redshifts of the components are @xmath38 , 0.6628 , 0.6634 and 0.6637 @xcite .",
    "this system is quite strong : the two strongest  components ( at @xmath39 and @xmath38 ) have column densities of @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath41 respectively @xcite . using the doppler parameters quoted by @xcite , we can convert these to equivalent widths of 0.44  and 0.41  respectively ( for the @xmath43 line in the rest frame ) .    a key question is whether this system can be associated with the group of galaxies detected in our gmos observations .",
    "the nearest of the galaxies to pks 2126@xmath0158  is galaxy # 17 , which lies at a distance of 51.2kpc to the quasar s line - of - sight ( hereinafter qlos ) .",
    "this places the qlos in the outer parts of the galaxy s halo .",
    "this separation is comparable to those seen in other absorption systems ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this galaxy , however , does show a large velocity offset from the absorbing system , with velocity differences @xmath44 with respect to the four components ranging from @xmath45 .",
    "galaxy # 18 provides a much closer match to the velocities ( @xmath46 ) , and is only 61.2kpc from the qlos .",
    "it is also the brightest galaxy in the group , with @xmath47 .",
    "a relationship has been noted by @xcite between the equivalent width @xmath48 of the  absorption system and the impact parameter @xmath49 of the associated galaxy , where @xmath50 . by converting the column density and doppler parameters of the absorption lines ,",
    "we can obtain the equivalent widths for the system : the four  @xmath51 lines from @xcite yield rest - frame values of @xmath52 and 0.13  ( in order of increasing redshift ) .",
    "comparing with the @xcite relationship , we find that the two stronger systems have @xmath48 values corresponding to @xmath53  kpc , while the two weaker systems correspond to @xmath54  kpc .",
    "the galaxies we have observed to be in the group all lie at impact parameters between these two values . there is , however , an object closer than the closest observed galaxy to the qlos ( # 17 ) , which , should it prove to be at the same redshift , may be a counterpart to one of the stronger systems ( see section  [ sec - altgal ] for more discussion on this source ) .",
    "if we focus just on the confirmed group members , the @xcite relationship taken at face value indicates that none of these galaxies are suitable counterparts for the absorption system(s ) .",
    "recent studies , however , such as that presented in @xcite , indicate that there is much more scatter in the @xmath55 relationship than the @xcite relationship would suggest .",
    "this calls into doubt its utility in making",
    "_ predictions _ about the likelihood of potential absorbers .",
    "the @xcite results suggest that the observed galaxies can indeed be considered potential hosts of the absorber , even with their relatively large impact parameters .",
    "the identity of the absorber then is still an open question .",
    "there are three objects closer to pks 2126@xmath0158  than galaxy # 17 .",

    "a spectrum of the object west of pks 2126@xmath0158  was observed by @xcite ( their c1 ) .",
    "they were unable to measure its redshift , but its optical and near - infrared colours are similar to their c2 ( the next galaxy to the west ) , which they found to be at @xmath56 .",
    "it is therefore likely that this galaxy is foreground to the group at @xmath1 .",

    "the 5 arcsec scale bar at bottom is equivalent to 34.9  kpc at the redshift of the galaxy group . ]",
    "the remaining two nearby objects were not able to be observed in our gmos observations ( due to the limitations of slit placement ) .",
    "object x1 appears to be stellar in morphology , and has colours @xmath57  not typical of a galaxy at the same redshift as the group .",
    "similarly , the more distant ( from the qlos ) object x3 has a stellar morphology , and even bluer colours than x1 ( @xmath58 ) , and thus is likely to be a star .",
    "the closest object to the quasar , x2 , has an extended , non - stellar morphology , and redder colours than x1 or x3 : @xmath59 , similar to the colours of the galaxies in the group at @xmath1 .",
    "it may thus be a galaxy in the same system .",
    "this putative galaxy would then lie at a projected distance of @xmath60 from the qlos , making it a possible candidate as a host of the absorbing system .",
    "its impact parameter provides a good match to the stronger absorption systems , if one uses the @xmath55 relationship of @xcite .",
    "a further point in its favour is its extended , somewhat elongated morphology  suggestive of a disc galaxy , matching the morphology of many -absorbing galaxies .",
    "is the absorbing gas necessarily associated with a galaxy ?",
    "the fact that we have a group environment means that the velocity dispersion is comparable to the rotational velocities of the individual galaxies .",
    "galaxy interactions are then more likely to strip gas from galaxies and leave it in the intra - group medium",
    ". such interactions could date from the formation epoch of the group , or from more contemporary encounters .",
    "an potential example of such an interaction , based on imaging data , is the pair # 17 and # 18 .",
    "the velocity difference between the two ( @xmath61 ) , is comparable to the velocity dispersion of the group , and so is feasible for an interaction .    a close - up of this pair of galaxies is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - gal - pair ] .",
    "there is evidence for a connection in flux between the two , with the flux in the `` bridge '' region reaching @xmath62 above the background .",
    "there is certainly no spectroscopic sign of any strong interaction taking place , with both galaxies exhibiting simple passive elliptical spectra .",
    "however , sensitive narrow - band imaging may be able to detect h@xmath15  emission from ejected gas in the vicinity of the galaxies , and would prove a good test of this interaction hypothesis .    .",
    "contour levels are at @xmath63 above the mean background .",
    "field of view is 6.13arcsec , and the direction to pks 2126@xmath0158  is indicated . ]",
    "pks 2126@xmath0158  is observed to have a strong  absorption system at the same redshift as the group of galaxies detected through our gmos spectroscopy .",
    "all the nearby galaxies that have spectroscopy are observed to be ellipticals : each shows a passive elliptical galaxy spectrum , and none shows evidence for on - going star - formation ( for instance , through the presence of an  emission line ) , which would indicate the presence of large amounts of gas .",
    "many  absorbers are identified with spiral galaxies ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this is by no means an exclusive statement .",
    "@xcite found that  absorption could be found in galaxies resembling present - day ellipticals as well as late - type spirals , @xcite found  absorption associated with two s0 galaxies , and recent studies @xcite have found a small fraction of elliptical absorbers .",
    "the latter studies also indicate that the absorption is also relatively patchy , and so one ( or more ) of the galaxies could have isolated areas of absorbing gas that happen to fall across the qlos , but are not themselves an important overall part of the galaxy .",
    "this may be similar to the situation observed by @xcite , who failed to find absorption associated with two elliptical galaxies despite their small impact parameters .",
    "it is possible that there is intra - group gas responsible for the absorption , although there is little direct evidence for this at this stage .",
    "the best candidate , however , for the absorber is probably galaxy x2 .",
    "it is closer to the qlos , and shows a much less uniform morphology than the identified galaxies .",
    "ultimately , a spectroscopic confirmation of its redshift is the only way to be sure  future observations will hopefully resolve this question .",
    "pks 2126@xmath0158  is rather luminous at all frequencies from radio to x - ray .",
    "we would like to know whether it is intrinsically luminous , or has been magnified through gravitational lensing by some intermediate mass distribution .",
    "strong lensing can be ruled out , as pks 2126@xmath0158  is not multiply - imaged  even at vlbi resolution ( @xmath64 mas ) , it shows a distinct core - jet structure @xcite .",
    "magnification due to gravitational lensing is still possible without multiple images being detected .",
    "there are two contexts in which this can take place : either a single image is produced , or there are indeed multiple images but at either faint levels or unresolved separations .",
    "since vlbi observations place quite strong limits on the existence of optically - unresolved images , for lensing to be taking place we would require the production of a single image only .",
    "however , @xcite find that this is possible only when the lensing is due to massive cluster - sized haloes ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "our observations show that the largest mass concentration along the line - of - sight is merely a galaxy group .",
    "the total luminosity of all galaxies in the group is @xmath66 ( assuming an absolute magnitude of the sun of @xmath67 , and taking into account all possible members , including x2 and the fainter objects in fig .  [ fig - closeup ] ) . for reasonable mass - to - light ratios",
    ", the group mass will be much less than the threshold given by @xcite .",
    "this is supported by the non - detection by @xcite of any extended x - ray emission in _ chandra _ images of pks 2126@xmath0158 , indicating the lack of hot cluster gas around or in the foreground of the quasar .",
    "we can thus rule out the possibility that pks 2126@xmath0158  is being magnified by any significant amount .",
    "its large apparent luminosity is then indeed indicative of its intrinsic power .",
    "we have observed the field surrounding pks 2126@xmath0158  with gemini south + gmos in multi - object spectroscopy mode , measuring the redshifts of most of the nearby galaxies .",
    "we find a group of galaxies at @xmath1 , at a similar velocity to a metal - line absorption system seen in the quasar s spectrum .",
    "the group has five confirmed members , and a further four fainter galaxies are seen nearby and are possibly associated .",
    "there are a further three galaxies close in redshift but at large separations on the sky  while not part of the group , they are certainly part of the same large - scale structure .    we have also made use of the multiplexing capabilities of gmos to measure the redshifts of many other galaxies in the field , and we see several distinct features in redshift - space foreground to the group .",
    "these observations , in showing the lack of a large cluster in front of pks 2126@xmath0158 , indicate that the likelihood the quasar is lensed is small .",
    "while the group as a whole appears to be associated with the absorption system , the fact that the redshifts of a number of nearby candidates have not been measured means some doubt remains as to the identity of the absorber .",
    "if the absorber is associated with the identified galaxies however , this would be a rare example of an absorption system associated with an early - type galaxy .",
