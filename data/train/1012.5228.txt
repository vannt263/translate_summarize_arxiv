    "searching for iron in pg1159 stars poses a difficult problem . the atmospheric parameter range ( = 75000  200000k , = 5.5  8.0 @xcite ) requires to look for lines from high ionization stages , at least .",
    "numerous lines are seen in uv spectra of hot hydrogen - rich central stars of planetary nebulae ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the search for these lines in pg1159 stars was unsuccessful .",
    "model calculations show that lines with detectable strength can only be expected in the cooler pg1159 stars .",
    "they vanish with increasing  because the ionization balance of iron shifts to higher stages .",
    "the same tendency is seen with decreasing gravity ( i.e. , increasing luminosity ) .",
    "based on the lack of lines , fe - deficiency of @xmath4  dex was concluded for four stars :  ( = 110000k , = 7.5 @xcite ) , the hybrid - pg1159 stars ( i.e. , h - balmer lines are visible ) ngc7094 and abell43 ( both have = 100000k , = 5.5 @xcite ) , the pg1159  [ wc ] transition type star abell78 ( = 110000k , = 5.5 @xcite ) .",
    "currently , these stars represent the strongest cases for fe - deficiency .",
    "also , fe - deficiency was claimed in some [ wc]-type central stars , the putative progenitors of pg1159 stars .",
    "this finding is not explained by evolutionary models .",
    "we speculated that fe nuclei could have been transformed to heavier elements by excessive s - processing .",

    "two lines were discovered in fuse spectra of the very hottest pg1159 stars ( fig.[fig : fe ] , left panels ) .",

    "is the dominant ionization stage throughout the line - forming regions .",
    "iron abundances were determined by performing fe nlte calculations in our grid of line - blanketed model atmospheres .",
    "fig.[fig : var ] displays the behaviour of one of the lines when temperature , gravity , and abundance are varied . as a result of our analysis , we find solar iron abundances in the hottest pg1159 stars @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with our above - mentioned detections of fe - deficiency in the four relatively cool pg1159 stars , based on the absence of lines . at present",
    ", we do not see why the fe abundance determinations would be in error for the cooler stars ; however we will re - address this issue .",
    "a scatter in fe abundances among pg1159 stars would be difficult to explain .",
    "however , there is one significant difference between the four putative fe - deficient stars and the four fe - solar central stars .",
    "comparison with evolutionary tracks @xcite shows that the former have masses in the range 0.53  0.56m@xmath2 , and the latter 0.71  0.82m@xmath2 . is this correlation between fe abundance and stellar mass relevant ?",

    "in a recent publication , landi & young @xcite were able to identify four emission lines in the @xmath31000  1200 region of the quiet sun , in spectra obtained with the soho / sumer instrument .",
    "this prompted us to look for these lines in fuse spectra of pg1159 stars .",
    "indeed , they are seen in several objects with = 110000  150000k . in particular , all four lines are present in the prototype  ( fig.[fig : pgelf ] ) .",
    "these detections will be an important tool to extend our iron abundance analyses from the hottest objects to the more cooler stars .",
    "interestingly , these lines are also detected in spectra of several of the hottest hydrogen - rich and dao central stars , and hot do white dwarfs ( fig.[fig : fe ] , right panel ) .",
    "together with previously identified lines , they can be used as an independent temperature indicator ."
