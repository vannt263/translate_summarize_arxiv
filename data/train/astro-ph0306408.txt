    "the antarctic icecap has provided an extraordinary laboratory for a variety of scientific purposes .",
    "the amanda , icecube@xcite , anita@xcite , and rice collaborations seek to use the dense , solid , large - volume , and extraordinarily transparent@xcite ( for @xmath0 ) icecap as a neutrino target ; the pioneering amanda experiment has sucessfully demonstrated the viability of in - ice optical detection of atmospheric neutrinos , through the reconstruction of hundreds of muon neutrinos .",
    "all these experiments seek to measure uhe neutrinos by detection of cherenkov radiation produced by @xmath1 .",
    "whereas amanda / icecube is optimized for detection of penetrating muons resulting from @xmath2 , rice / anita are designed to detect compact electromagnetic cascades initiated by @xmath3 : @xmath4 .",
    "as the cascade develops , atomic electrons in the target medium are swept into the forward - moving shower , resulting in a net charge on the shower front of @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the shower energy in gev .",
    "such cascades produce broadband cherenkov radiation  for @xmath7 ,",
    "the emitting region approximates a point charge of magnitude @xmath8 and therefore emits fully coherently ; fortuitously , the field attenuation length at such wavelengths @xmath91 km .",
    "one calculation finds that , for 1 pev@xmath10 , radio detection of cascades becomes more cost - effective than pmt - based techniques@xcite .",
    "the rice experiment consists of an array of 20 in - ice dipole receivers , deployed at depths of @xmath11 m , and read out into digital oscilloscopes .",
    "calibration techniques and event reconstruction , as well as results on the neutrino flux at earth , are presented elsewhere@xcite . an initial @xmath12-only analysis based on data taken in august",
    ", 2000 has been presented elsewhere@xcite .",
    "using calculations presented herein of the expected radio - frequency signal strength due to an electromagnetic shower , the measured rice hardware performance , reconstruction software and simulation@xcite , we now report on an expanded neutrino search based on all data taken in 1999 , 2000 , and 2001 .",
    "we additionally use the excellent timing characteristics of the rice receiver array to measure the electromagnetic wave speed through the firn .",
    "the rice experiment presently consists of a 20-channel array of dipole radio receivers ( `` rx '' ) , scattered within a 200 m@xmath13200 m@xmath13200 m cube , at 100 - 300 m depths .",
    "the signal from each antenna is boosted by a 36-db in - ice amplifier , then carried by coaxial cable to the surface observatory , where the signal is filtered ( suppressing noise below 200 mhz ) , re - amplified ( either 52- or 60-db gain ) , and split - one copy is fed into a camac crate to form the event trigger ; the other signal copy is routed into one channel of an hp54542 digital oscilloscope .",
    "short - duration pulses broadcast from under - ice transmitters provide the primary calibration signals , and are used to verify vertex reconstruction techniques .",
    "figure [ fig : alltxrecon]a ) illustrates the vertex reconstruction performance for our calibration transmitter data ( transmitters are typically 100 - 200 m from receivers ) using two vertex - reconstruction algorithms .",
    "one algorithm searches a cubic km .",
    "grid around the array for the source point most consistent with the observed hit times ; the second technique analytically solves for the vertex using four - hit subcombinations of all the available hits .",
    "typical differences between reconstructed and known depths are of the order a few meters . for non - calibration events ,",
    "we expect reconstructed source vertices to cluster around the surface ; smearing effects due to ray tracing through the firn may be considerable .",
    "figure [ fig : alltxrecon]b ) displays the reconstructed source depth for our `` general '' triggers for various hit multiplicities ; source depths are observed to peak towards z=0 ( consistent with surface anthropogenic activity ) .    with newer data , and after applying variable index - of - refraction corrections , the reconstructed source depth distribution",
    "typically sharpens , as shown in figure [ fig : txrxtest ] .",

    "ultrahigh energy electron neutrinos from cosmological sources can be detected from the shower created in dense media ( ice e.g. ) by the secondaries in a charged current interaction ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "shower particles travelling faster than light in the medium emit coherent cherenkov signals at radio frequencies , which are detected by radio antennas buried in the medium .",
    "we have modeled the signal contribution from the dominant ( @xmath15 80% ) electromagnetic shower component using geant detector simulation tools .",
    "shower simulation and electromagnetic pulse generation from shower particles are essentially two separate procedures in our study .",
    "the details of our previous studies can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we report here highlights of our recent efforts .",
    "we have defined a cube of ice of km scale as the target medium in our geant simulations . given an effective atomic number @xmath16 , an effective mass @xmath17 and a density 0.92 g/@xmath18 of the medium , geant calculates all necessary parameters ( radiation length , absorption length and cross - sections , e.g. ) internally .",
    "the electromagnetic showers , in our analysis , are initiated by an @xmath19 or @xmath20 with pre - specified momenta and position .",
    "geant gives detailed particle tracking information such as interaction points , total energy , energy lost in interaction and interaction time in output data files .",
    "these data files are used later to calculate electromagnetic pulses and to diagnose shower properties .",
    "we used geant 3.21 and , more recently , geant 4 to simulate electromagnetic showers in ice . in our original work@xcite",
    ", we used geant 3.21 with default settings to generate showers , which yields significantly less track length compared to geant 4 and to geant 3.21 with `` preferred '' settings .",
    "the reason is that , with the default setting , electrons are stopped prematurely before reaching the low kinetic energy threshold needed for accurate cherenkov radio signal emission calculations .",
    "our updated results from geant 3.21 with preferred settings and geant 4 are in reasonable agreement with each other and with other results@xcite . in the lower frequency range ,",
    "the signal is significantly increased compared to the signal reported earlier .",
    "total track lengths and particle yields at the shower maximum are reported in table [ tab : sim1 ] for an average 100 gev @xmath19 shower generated by geant 3.21 with the preferred and default settings and geant 4 . also shown",
    "are results from our copy of the zas , halzen and stanev@xcite code for comparison .",
    ".track length and particle yield results from an averaged 100 gev electron - induced shower using different monte carlo shower codes .",
    "the error bars correspond to error in the mean , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the standard deviation and @xmath23 is the number of showers ( 100 for geant 4 and 20 in all other cases ) . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : cuts ]      in addition to searches for neutrinos , the rice detector offers sensitivity to other analyses ( monopole detection , studies of neutrinos coincident with grb s and air showers , searches for micro - black holes , etc . ) ; results of such searches will be reported in the future .",
    "the 2002 and 2003 datasets comprise our highest - quality data thus far and should offer substantial improvement over the results presented herein . beginning in 2004 ,",
    "we hope to take advantage of the scientific opportunity presented by icecube hole drilling to substantially expand the current rice array .",
    "whereas neutrinos are expected to interact below the array , rice rf backgrounds due to air showers , or above - surface anthropogenic sources , require recontruction of sources viewed upwards through the firn .",
    "conversely , a receiver array deployed above the ice surface would also require ray tracing from in - ice neutrino interactions to the above - surface detector .",
    "this necessitates ray tracing the trajectories of radio waves through a region of variable ice density and dielectric constant , resulting in shorter signal propagation times and reduced signal amplitudes ( at non - zero incident angles ) compared to the case where sources are entirely below the firn .",
    "each rice receiver consists of a half - wave dipole antenna , offering good reception over the range 0.21 ghz , plus a 36 db low - noise amplifier .",
    "the peak response of the antenna is measured to be @xmath15500 mhz in air ( @xmath15300 mhz in ice ) , with a bandwidth @xmath240.2 .",
    "an identical dipole antenna , without the amplifier , is used as the transmitter for this measurement . as the transmitter was slowly lowered into a rice borehole , a pulser signal was broadcast from the transmitter ( at 5 - 10 meter depth increments ) to the rice receiver array , and signal arrival times in the receivers recorded ( figure [ fig : nvz - tx - rx.xfig.eps ] ) .",
    "this afforded two measurements of the index of refraction : 1 ) the index of refraction as a function of depth ( @xmath25 ) could be inferred by determining the transit time difference to a particular receiver between successive transmitter locations ( @xmath26 , and 2 ) the `` mean '' index of refraction ( @xmath27 ) , averaged over the distance from the transmitter to any receiver could be inferred by subtracting cable delays from the measured full circuit ( pulse generator@xmath28transmitter@xmath28receiver@xmath28daq ) time .",
    "at each transmitter location , the @xmath29 of the transmitter signal , as well as an 8.192 microsecond waveform ( sampled at 2 gsa / s ) was recorded in an hp5452 digital oscilloscope , for each receiver .",
    "the hit time is determined from the first @xmath30 excursion in each waveform ; the variation in receiver hit time with transmitter depth is shown in figure [ fig : nvz - tx - rx.xfig.eps]b . as the transmitter approaches the ( deeper ) receiver , the hit time migrates to smaller values ; also evident in the figure are the `` afterpulses '' corresponding to signals which reflect off of the surface firn - air boundary , and back down to the buried receiver .",
    "as the transmitter is lowered to greater depths , the incident angle ( with respect to normal surface incidence from the under - ice transmitter location ) decreases and reflection effects correspondingly decrease , as well .    the local electromagnetic wave propagation velocity is directly obtained from successive hit times such as in figure [ fig : nvz - tx - rx.xfig.eps]b , and can therefore be translated into an index - of - refraction profile , @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig : rfdraft - finalfit.eps]a ) shows the locus of hit times for several receiver channels ; the local value of n(z ) can be obtained from slopes to these data points .",
    "we have attempted to obtain an `` aggregate '' estimate of n(z ) by : a ) adding the raising - transmitter plus lowering - transmitter datasets , b ) adding all `` good '' data from all possible channels , where the contribution to the final average from each channel was weighted by geometry ( favoring nearly - vertical channels ) , c ) averaging over possible transmitter location uncertainties by rebinning data and re - obtaining averages using 20 m distance differences ( rather than 10 m ) between successive tx broadcasts . in all cases",
    ", we assumed a transmitter location uncertainty of 0.5 m for all measurements , as well as a hit - time uncertainty of 1 ns . fig .",
    "[ fig : rfdraft - finalfit.eps]b ) shows the result of this procedure , and also includes data obtained by broadcasting horizontally between a transmitter - receiver pair being lowered simultaneously into two neighboring boreholes .",
    "also included are measurements derived from the `` average '' n(z ) values obtained using absolute @xmath29 measurements , as well as comparisons with the predictions of the schytt model@xcite , which relates index of refraction directly to firn density @xmath31 , assuming that the ice - firn transition occurs at either z=-115 m or z=-130 m.    the rice data points are fit to a 2nd - order polynomial , with the constraint that the value of index of refraction at large depths approach a constant asymptotic value .",
    "we obtained an estimate of that asymptotic value by broadcasting from the deepest buried rice transmitter down to the deepest buried rice receiver over a distance of 233.4 m ; both of these antennas are presumably well below the firn - ice transition .",
    "the measured propagation time is 1369@xmath328 ns , corresponding to @xmath33 .",
    "this value is in fair agreement with the accepted value of 1.78 , as obtained by several measurements .",
    "the overall error ( statistical + systematic ) of each data point is estimated at 4% .",
    "the variable index - of - refraction of the firn has another important experimental consequence , due to the fact that any change in the index of refraction will introduce non - zero reflections at the corresponding interface . in any region",
    "where there is a variation in the index of refraction , reflection and transmission amplitudes , for both the perpendicular and parallel components of the incident electric field , are given by the standard `` fresnel coefficients '' for dielectric media@xcite : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , as qualitatively illustrated in figure [ fig : nvz - tx - rx.xfig.eps]b .",
    "thus , the measured signal strength of above - ice sources , as viewed by below - firn receivers ( or vice versa ) , depends on the degree of variation in the index of refraction .",
    "we have used this principle to check the derived index of refraction based on amplitudes alone .    to investigate firn transmission effects ,",
    "we have broadcast to the rice array from a surface point in the center of the rice array ( on top of amanda hole # 10 ) , compared to a point having a high inclination angle relative to the rice array ( in the vicinity of the spase building , approximately 350 meters in @xmath38 away from the center of the rice array ) .",
    "figure [ fig : am10-spase - xyz - fft.eps ] shows the results of this exercise , comparing measured electric field strengths , at the known broadcast cw frequency , and corrected for both receiver - to - receiver channel gain , as well as distance from transmitter to receiver . at each transmitter location , ten waveforms were captured , and the signal strength at 500 mhz obtained from a fourier transform of the time - domain signal . for the in - air horn antenna receivers , which are not subject to fresnel losses ,",
    "there is good agreement between the distant vs. the near source transmitter location data .",
    "however , broadcasting at large inclination angles from a more distant source point results in received signal strengths smaller by an order of magnitude than what can be accounted for by just 1/r and gain corrections .",
    "our results are qualitatively consistent with the expected fresnel coefficients@xcite . however , a rigorous comparison with the fresnel equations would require consideration of several effects , including : a ) surface feature effects , b ) evanescent waves which may propagate along the surface , and c ) the true curvature of radio waves through the firn ; we have not systematically evaluated such possible effects . due to the latter uncertainty",
    ", no dipole field pattern geometry corrections have been applied  at relatively steep angles , such dipole field pattern corrections can be substantial .",
    "it should be noted that , in general , incorporating such corrections would have the effect of increasing the disparity between the red vs. green / blue data points .",
    "we have estimated the attenuation length in warmer ( 20 c ) greenland ice , using gpr data taken by the ku group of gogineni _ et al _ in greenland@xcite . here ,",
    "we use the relative ratios of `` return '' signal strengths from a transmitter , on a low - flying plane , broadcasting signals off the under - ice bedrock ( i.e. , comparing the ratio of signal strength of the bedrock echo at different locations ) to extract @xmath39 . as indicated in fig . [",
    "fig : may31.eps ] , our initial estimates of the attenuation length from these data are encouraging and in agreement with previous measurements at these temperatures and wavelengths . with the larger array size afforded by icecube , a direct _ in situ _ measurement",
    "using rice receivers and transmitters should be straightforward .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the support of the research corporation , the nsf office of polar programs under grant # opp-0085119 , as well as the university of kansas undergraduate research awards .",
    "the rice experiment would not have been possible without the generous logistical and material support of the amanda collaboration .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge additional support from the ku general research fund and the ku research development fund , the new zealand marsden foundation , and the research corporation .",
