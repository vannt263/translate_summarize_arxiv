    "given a sufficiently smooth , compact initial hypersurface @xmath0 we are interested in finding a family of embeddings @xmath1 such that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mean curvature and @xmath4 are the principal curvatures of the surface @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are a choice of unit normal and the induced measure of @xmath8 respectively .",
    "note that the flow ( [ fullflow ] ) decreases surface area while preserving volume ( see section [ notpre ] ) .",
    "for convex hypersurfaces without boundary it is known that a unique solution exists for all time and that the hypersurfaces converge to a sphere as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "other results include average mean convex surfaces with initially small traceless second fundamental form converging to spheres @xcite and surfaces that are graphs over spheres with a height function close to zero , in a certain function space , converging to spheres @xcite .",
    "the case where the initial surface has a boundary has also been studied . in this case",
    "it is assumed that @xmath10 is smoothly embedded in the domain @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the volume enclosed by @xmath10 and @xmath14 will be labelled @xmath15 and @xmath6 is chosen to point outward .",
    "the boundary conditions for the flow are then that @xmath10 intersects @xmath16 orthogonally . assuming @xmath10 to be rotationally symmetric it was proved in @xcite that the flow exists for all time and converges to a cylinder in @xmath14 of volume @xmath15 under the assumption @xmath17 this constraint is needed to ensure that the solution never touches the axis of rotation , so that no singularities develop .",
    "short time existence of the flow can be proven using standard parabolic techniques for initially smooth surfaces , however in this paper we are concerned with a larger class of initial surfaces so need a more general existence theorem ( see section [ notpre ] ) .",
    "the main result of this paper is    if @xmath10 is a graph over the cylinder @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 and with height function sufficiently small in @xmath20 , @xmath21 , then its flow by ( [ fullflow ] ) exists for all time and converges exponentially fast to a cylinder as @xmath9 , with respect to the @xmath22 topology for any @xmath23 .",
    "[ mainr ]    an important point to note is that the limiting cylinder may not be the same as the cylinder @xmath18 thus the cylinders are stable critical points of the pde ( [ fullflow ] ) , but not necessarily asymptotically stable .",
    "an immediate consequence of this theorem is that there are non - axially symmetric surfaces that converge to a cylinder under the flow ( [ fullflow ] ) , since there are non - axially symmetric surfaces in any @xmath24 neighbourhood of a cylinder .",
    "lastly note that the condition @xmath19 is of a similar nature to the condition ( [ mariaassump ] ) ; in fact for a cylinder ( [ mariaassump ] ) reduces to @xmath25 . in view of this , when considering the flow of axially - symmetric surfaces that are close to a cylinder we reproduce the results of @xcite under a weaker condition .",
    "the condition is also sharp , in the sense that if @xmath26 then there is a one - parameter family of unduloids , satisfying the boundary conditions , such that @xmath18 is the only cylinder in the family , i.e. , there are stationary solutions to the flow arbitarily close to @xmath18 that are not cylinders .    in section [ notpre ] of this paper",
    "we convert the flow ( [ fullflow ] ) to a pde for the graph function and also introduce the function spaces and notation that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "the section ends with some important theorems about the flow . in section",
    "[ stab ] we consider the problem as an ode on banach spaces and determine the spectrum of the linearisation of the speed .",
    "this then allows us to find a center manifold of the flow , which is seen to consist locally entirely of cylinders .",
    "lastly exponential attractivity to this manifold is proven .",
    "the author would like to thank maria athanassenas for her initial suggestion of working with cylinders , support , advice and help in preparing this paper , and also todd oliynyk for his advice and encouragement in dealing with center manifolds . finally to monash university and the school of mathematical sciences for their support .",
    "in this paper we consider @xmath27 , a given cylinder of radius @xmath28 and length @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 is a graph over @xmath18 .",
    "the volume form on such a graph surface will be denoted by @xmath33 and we let @xmath34 be the function such that @xmath35 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath36 , the @xmath37-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath28 , and @xmath38 $ ] , so that @xmath39 . proceeding as escher and simonett @xcite and converting the flow to an evolution equation for the height function @xmath40 it is known that up to a tangential diffeomorphism the flow ( [ fullflow ] ) is equivalent to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mean curvature of the surface defined by @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes the inverse metric on @xmath45 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the graph functions @xmath46 are chosen in the little - hlder spaces , which are defined for @xmath47 , @xmath23 , an open set @xmath48 and a multi - index @xmath49 with @xmath50 as follows ( see @xcite ) : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the derivative operator on @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 are the hlder spaces : @xmath56 the norms on the little - hlder spaces are the same as those on the hlder spaces , @xmath57 where @xmath58 the little - hlder spaces can be extended to a manifold by means of the atlas of @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , it is known that the little - hlder spaces are the continuous interpolation spaces between the @xmath22 spaces ( see @xcite ) , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is an interpolation functor for each @xmath61 and is defined for @xmath62 as follows : @xmath63 the interpolation space @xmath64 can also be viewed as the closure of the smooth functions on the cylinder , @xmath65 , inside the space of hlder continuous functions @xmath66 ( see @xcite ) . to simplify the notation involving the boundary conditions ,",
    "let @xmath67 represent any function space on the cylinder and set @xmath68 with this notation we also have that @xmath69 where @xmath47 - a result that follows from the reiteration theorem ( @xcite theorem 1.2.15 ) along with the characterisation of interpolation spaces in chapter 3 of @xcite .",

    "we now give a general short - time existence theorem    for @xmath21 and a given hypersurface @xmath10 of class @xmath87 , the flow ( [ fullflow ] ) has a unique classical solution @xmath88 for some @xmath89 .",
    "each hypersurface @xmath8 is of class @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",

    "this result follows from the main result by escher and simonett in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the arguments in their proof still hold with @xmath95 , @xmath87 and @xmath96 replaced by @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively due to equation ( [ interp ] ) . @xmath86",

    "hence for @xmath106 @xmath109 it was shown in @xcite that @xmath110 so combining these results gives , for @xmath106 , @xmath111 the divergence theorem and the boundary conditions give the result .",

    "the operator @xmath120 is self adjoint with respect to the @xmath121 inner product on @xmath122 , since the boundary terms disappear for functions in @xmath118 when integrating by parts .",

    "consider @xmath149 , then @xmath150 therefore we need only consider other eigenfunctions , orthogonal to @xmath147 , in order to characterise the spectrum .",
    "this means that for an eigenfunction @xmath151 @xmath152 hence by lemma [ linop2 ] , @xmath153 .",
    "the remaining eigenfunctions of @xmath103 are then the remaining eigenfunctions of @xmath120 , with the same eigenvalues . therefore for @xmath154 and @xmath155 the eigenvalues are @xmath156 with eigenfunctions @xmath145 it is clear from these expressions that @xmath157 , and we relabel the constant eigenfunction as @xmath158 for convenience , so",
    "zero is an eigenvalue of multiplicity @xmath159 . if @xmath160 we have @xmath161 . also if @xmath162 and @xmath163 then @xmath164 . the last case is for @xmath165 and @xmath166 where the eigenvalues are bounded above by @xmath167 : @xmath168 these eigenvalues are all negative under the condition @xmath19 given in the statement of the theorem .",
    "@xmath86    in what follows , we set @xmath169 to be the projection from @xmath64 onto the @xmath170 eigenspace given by @xmath171 where we use @xmath172 to denote the @xmath121 inner product on @xmath122 . because @xmath103 is self adjoint with respect to this inner product , it is clear that @xmath173 for every @xmath106 . due to this @xmath118",

    ", there is a function @xmath176 , such that @xmath177 is lipschitz continuous , @xmath178 and @xmath179 is a locally invariant manifold of equation ( [ graphlin ] ) with dimension @xmath116 provided @xmath19 .",
    "note that by _ locally invariant _ it is meant that there exists a neighbourhood of zero in @xmath180 such that if @xmath181 then the solution to ( [ graphlin ] ) is in @xmath182 for all time or until @xmath183 .    in order to know that the assumptions of theorem 9.2.2 in @xcite are satisfied in our case , we use equation ( [ interp ] ) to show that for any @xmath184 satisfying @xmath185 the following holds @xmath186 the assumptions are therefore satisfied by proving there exists a neighbourhood of 0 , @xmath187 , such that @xmath188 and , for all @xmath189",
    ", @xmath190 is the part in @xmath64 of a sectorial operator @xmath191 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , @xcite that the mean curvature can be written in the form @xmath192 where @xmath193 is a second order uniformly elliptic operator that smoothly depends on @xmath46 and its first derivative .",
    "this means that @xmath194 is a smooth operator inside a neighbourhood , @xmath195 , where if @xmath196 we have @xmath197 for all @xmath31 .",
    "as @xmath198 we have @xmath199 , this operator is uniformly elliptic , hence its negative is sectorial .",
    "now the operator @xmath200 can be seen to be sectorial : using the definition of sectorial there exists @xmath75 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 such that @xmath201 for all @xmath202 and @xmath203 . therefore @xmath204 by the reverse triangle inequality and by taking @xmath205 we get @xmath206 thus , by applying proposition 2.1.11 in @xcite , @xmath207 is sectorial .",
    "this then implies by proposition 2.4.2 in @xcite that @xmath191 is sectorial for all @xmath46 in a neighbourhood of zero , @xmath208 . since @xmath190 is the part of @xmath209 in @xmath64 the conditions of theorem 9.2.2 in @xcite are satisfied by setting @xmath210 .",

    "also note , the center manifold , @xmath212 , is defined differently in @xcite as compared to @xcite , however they can be seen to be equal on @xmath215 .",
    "the rest of the proof follows from @xcite , where @xmath216 is formulated in terms of eigenfunctions : @xmath217 with @xmath218 being the point of intersection of the axis of rotation with the @xmath219-plane and @xmath220 the difference between its radius and the radius of @xmath18 .",
    "this map is smooth on a neighbourhood @xmath221 of @xmath222 and its derivative at zero is given by @xmath223 the map taking @xmath224 to the coordinates of @xmath225 with respect to the basis @xmath226 , @xmath227 , is then found to have derivative at zero equal to the identity and hence is a diffeomorphism from @xmath221 onto its image , possibly making @xmath221 smaller .",
    "this means that the projection of @xmath228 is an open neighbourhood of @xmath229 .",
    "this can be made to coincide with @xmath215 ( after possible renaming ) and since @xmath230 we conclude that @xmath213 and @xmath212 coincide locally .",
