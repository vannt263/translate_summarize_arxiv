    "according to the perdew s popular classification of density functional approximations ( dfa ) @xcite , the random phase approximation ( rpa ) is situated on the highest , fifth rung of jacob s ladder , which leads from the simplest hartree level towards the `` heaven '' corresponding to the exact solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "when stepping upwards on jacob s ladder , one uses more and more ingredients of the kohn - sham single determinant . starting from the lowest rungs , the density , its gradient , the full set of occupied orbitals are successively necessary for the construction of the functional . at the highest rung dfa",
    "is usually based on many - body methods , which require the knowledge of the complete set of occupied and virtual orbitals .",
    "such methods have the drawback that the size of the virtual orbital space can be very large even in a moderately sized atomic orbital basis . in the case of plane wave calculations",
    "the virtual space can become even prohibitively large .",
    "one solution to keep the size of matrices in reasonable limits makes recourse to an auxiliary basis set to expand the occupied - virtual product functions .",
    "such approaches are known in quantum chemistry as resolution of identity @xcite or density - fitting @xcite methods .",
    "similar advantages can be achieved by cholesky decomposition @xcite techniques . in plane wave calculations",
    "the plane wave basis itself can be used to expand the product states @xcite .",
    "further gain can be achieved by projection methods , which avoid any explicit reference to virtual orbitals .",
    "such a technique , named projective dielectric eigenpotential ( pdep ) method , has been successfully applied to construct the dielectric function in plane wave rpa calculations @xcite .",
    "recently , rocca succeeded to reduce further the size of the problem by a prescreened set of virtuals @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to demonstrate that an _ approximate _ variant of the rpa ( and also of the mp2 ) correlation energy can be expressed by using quantities that are computable from occupied orbitals alone . in this context",
    ", one should mention the beautiful result , which has been obtained by surjn , who has shown that the mp2 correlation energy , exempt of any further approximation in a given basis set , can be reformulated as a functional of the hartree - fock density matrix , i.e.  using exclusively the occupied orbitals @xcite .",
    "our main interest is not to reproduce the full correlation energy with high numerical precision , but we focus our attention to a well - defined part of it , namely on the long - range dynamical correlation energy , which is usually taken responsible for the london dispersion forces .",
    "it is now well - documented that most of the conventional density functional calculations in the kohn - sham framework , unless special corrections are added to the total energy , are unable to grasp the physics of these long - range forces .",
    "various fairly successful dispersion correction schemes are known , but although most of them were claimed to posses an essentially _ ab initio _",
    "character , they use , without exception , some `` external '' data , like atomic polarizabilities , atomic radii , _ etc_  @xcite . even if these quantities are usually not taken from experimental sources , and",
    "rather originate from ab initio computations , their presence deprives these theories of their self - contained character .",
    "hence , although we do not pretend that the rather drastic approximations which are going to be implemented in the following allow us to achieve results of a quality comparable to the precision attained by carefully fine - tuned methodologies , we argue that the ingredients of the present approach originate from a controlled series of approximations and do not use any `` external '' inputs .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the relatively costly and sophisticated methods , like rpa , we do not need virtual orbitals , _",
    "i.e. _  we stay on the fourth rung of jacob s ladder .",
    "our approach relies on the use of localized occupied molecular orbitals ( lmos ) that can be obtained relatively easily by a unitary transformation in the subspace of occupied orbitals , according to either an external or an internal localization criterion @xcite .",
    "the localization of virtual orbitals is much more difficult , since the usual localization criteria for the occupied orbitals lead often to divergent results .",
    "it is to be noted that recently a significant progress has been reported @xcite for the efficient localization of virtual orbitals .",
    "however , we follow another strategy here and build excited determinants using localized functions which are able to span the essential part of the virtual space .",
    "one of the most popular local correlation approaches in this spirit consists in using the atomic orbital ( ao ) basis functions to represent the virtual space .",
    "they are made orthogonal to the occupied space by projection , leading to the projected aos ( paos ) techniques @xcite .",
    "the locality of these functions is guaranteed by construction , even if it may be somewhat deteriorated by the projection procedure .    in the present work we are going to revisit and explore a quite old idea of foster and boys from the early sixties @xcite .",
    "the main concern of these authors was to construct a set of virtual orbitals directly from the set of occupied lmos by multiplying them with solid spherical harmonic functions centered on the barycenter of the lmo .",
    "the orthogonality of these new functions can be ensured by a projection procedure .",
    "boys and foster called these new functions , obtained after multiplication , _ oscillator orbitals _ ( oos ) , and after removing the components of the oos in the space of the occupied orbitals they may be called projected oscillator orbitals ( poos ) .",
    "very few articles in the literature mention boys oscillator orbitals @xcite , probably because it had no particular numerical advantage in high - precision configuration interaction calculations and its practical implementation raised a number of complications which could be avoided by more straightforward algorithms , like the use of the full set of virtual molecular orbitals ( vmos ) .",
    "we have found only a single , very recent article , which referred to the notion of oscillator orbitals @xcite as a useful concept , but not as a practical computational tool . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the mathematical implications of using oscillator orbitals to define the virtual space has never been rigorously studied .",
    "such an analysis is beyond the scope of the present study : it is going to be the subject of a forthcoming publication .",
    "the poos are non - orthogonal among each other , which is at the origin one of the complications mentioned above .",
    "this problem can be handled just like in the case of the paos , therefore a theory of electron correlation based on poos can follow a similar reasoning as local correlation methods using paos   @xcite . in particular , in this paper , the rpa method will be reformulated for a virtual solace constructed from poos .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the projected oscillator orbitals bear some similarities to the trial perturbed wave function in the variation - perturbational technique associated with the names of kirkwood @xcite , pople and schofield @xcite ( kps ) , to calculate multipole molecular polarizabilities .",
    "the closely related karplus - kolker @xcite ( kk ) method and its variants @xcite use a similar _ ansatz _ for the perturbed orbitals . in these latter methods , which were formulated originally as simplified perturbed hartree - fock theories , the first order perturbed wave function is a determinant with first order orbitals @xmath0 which are taken in the following product form @xcite @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are linear combination of some analytically defined functions , like polynomials .",
    "as we shall see , the principal difference of this _ ansatz _ and the poos is that in the former case one multiplies the occupied canonical orbitals with the function @xmath2 , while the oscillator orbitals are constructed from localized orbitals .    as mentioned previously , our main focus is the modeling of london dispersion forces .",
    "it has been demonstrated in our earlier works @xcite that the essential physical ingredients of london dispersion forces are contained in the range - separated hybrid rpa method , where the short - range correlation effects are described within a dfa and the long - range exchange and correlation are handled at the long - range hartree - fock and long - range rpa levels , respectively . among numerous possible formulations of the rpa @xcite , we have chosen to adopt the variant based on the ring - diagram approximation to the coupled cluster doubles theory .",
    "the relevant amplitude equations will be rewritten with the help of poos leading to simplified working equations , which do not refer to virtual orbitals explicitly . for the sake of comparison we are going to study the case where the poos are expanded in the virtual orbital space .",
    "the long - range electron repulsion integrals , appearing in the range - separated correlation energy expression , can be reasonably approximated by a truncated multipole expansion .",
    "it means that in addition to the well - known improved convergence properties of the correlation energy with respect to the size of the basis set , one is able to control the convergence through the selection of the multipolar nature of the excitations , leading to a possibility of further computational gain .",
    "the exploitation of localized orbitals for dispersion energy calculations has already been proposed since the early works on local correlation methods @xcite . in classical and semiclassical models",
    "most often the atoms are selected as force centers ; only a few works exploit the advantages related to the use of two - center localized orbitals and lone pairs .",
    "a notable exception is the recent work of silvestrelli and coworkers @xcite , who adapted the tkatchenko - scheffler model @xcite for maximally localized wannier functions , which are essentially boys localized orbitals for solids .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that one of the very first use of the bond polarizabilities as interacting units for the decryption of london dispersion forces has been suggested as early as in 1969 by claverie and rein @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "our approach , at least in its simplest form , is situated somewhere between classical models and fully quantum local correlation methods and can be considered ( practically in all its forms ) as a coarse - grained nonlocal dispersion functional formulated exclusively on the basis of ground state densities and occupied orbitals .",
    "it will be shown how the various matrix elements can be expressed from occupied orbital quantities only . as a numerical illustration",
    ", molecular c@xmath3 dispersion coefficients will be calculated from localized orbital contributions and compared to experimental reference data .",
    "the paper will be closed by a discussion of possible future developments .",
    "the _ a posteriori _ localization of the subspace of the occupied orbitals is a relatively standard procedure , which can be achieved following a large variety of localization criteria ( for a succinct overview , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the context of correlation energy calculations , _",
    "i.e. _  in various `` local correlation approaches '' , the most widely used localization methods are based either on the criterion of foster and boys @xcite or that proposed by pipek and mezey @xcite . for reasons which become clearer below , in the present work we will use the foster - boys localization criterion , which can be expressed in various equivalent forms @xcite . in",
    "its the most suggestive formulation , the foster - boys localization procedure consists in the maximization of the squared distance between the centroids of the orbitals :    @xmath4    another form of the localization criterion , which is strictly equivalent to the previous one , corresponds to the minimization of the sum of quadratic orbital spreads    @xmath5    as it has been demonstrated by resta @xcite , the previous minimization implies that the sum of the spherically averaged squared off - diagonal matrix elements of the position operator is minimal too .",
    "this last property of the boys localized orbitals is going to be useful in the development of the present model .",
    "any set of localized orbitals obtained by a unitary transformation from a set of occupied orbitals spans the same invariant subspace as the generalized kohn - sham operator , @xmath6 , and satisfies the equation :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the range - separated hybrid operator . in this expression @xmath9 is the kinetic energy , @xmath10 is the nuclear attraction , @xmath11 is the full - range hartree , @xmath12 is the long - range hartree - fock ( non - local ) exchange , and @xmath13 is the short - range exchange - correlation potential operator .",
    "the range - separation parameter , @xmath14 , defined below , cuts the electron repulsion terms to short- and long- range components . for @xmath15",
    "one recovers the full - range density functional approximation ( dfa ) , while for @xmath16 one obtains the full - range hartree - fock theory .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , inspired by the original idea suggested first by foster and boys @xcite and refined later by boys @xcite , we propose here to construct localized virtual orbitals by multiplying the localized occupied orbital @xmath17 by solid spherical harmonics having their origin at the barycenter of the localized occupied orbital .",
    "according to boys @xcite , this definition can be made independent of the orientation of the coordinate system by choosing local coordinate axes which are parallel to the principal axes of the tensor of the moment of inertia of the charge distribution @xmath18 ( see appendix  [ app : poolocframe ] ) .    in the following we are going to elaborate the theory for the simplest case , when these _ oscillator orbitals _ are generated by first order solid spherical harmonic polynomials , _",
    "i.e. _  the @xmath19-th lmo is multiplied by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the @xmath22 component of the position operator and @xmath23 is a component of the position vector pointing to the centroid of the @xmath19-th lmo , defined as @xmath24 .",
    "it is possible to generate oscillator orbitals by higher order spherical harmonics too , which is left for forthcoming work .",
    "we denote the poo by @xmath25 , where the index @xmath26 refers to the fact that the oo has been generated from the @xmath19-th lmo by using the @xmath21 function . for the sake of the simplicity of the formulae",
    ", the poos will be expressed in the laboratory frame ; the expressions for the dipolar poos in a local frame are shown in the appendix  [ app : poolocframe ] .",
    "the poo reads in the laboratory frame as    @xmath27    with @xmath28 , the projector onto the virtual space .    in eq .",
    "[ eq : defpoo ] the `` pure '' ( oo ) component of the poo is @xmath29 , while the orthogonalization tails stem from the term @xmath30 . in this sense",
    "the `` locality '' of the oo is somewhat deteriorated , since we have contributions from each of the other lmos . at this point",
    "the boys localization criterion will be at our advantage , since it ensures that the sum of the off - diagonal elements of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 operators taken between the occupied orbitals , and appearing in the orthogonalization tails , be minimized @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the boys - localization scheme seems to be naturally adapted for the construction of dipolar oscillator orbitals .    to illustrate the concept of dipolar oscillator orbitals ,",
    "two examples are taken from the oxygen lone pair and the c - h bonding orbitals of the formaldehyde molecule , described in the above - defined local frame .",
    "figs 1 and 2 show the localized orbitals and the three projected dipolar oscillator orbitals having a nodal surface intersecting the orbital centroid and oriented in the three cartesian coordinate directions of the local coordinate system , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is quite clear that the node coincides with the region of the highest electron density of the orbital and in this sense ensures an optimal description of the correlation .",
    "higher order polynomials generate virtual orbitals with further nodes .    from now on , we will use the simplified notations @xmath35 and @xmath36 , in other words",
    "the subscript @xmath37 on the orbital index indicates that it is an oscillator orbital .",
    "we designate the occupied ( canonical or localized ) molecular orbitals as @xmath38 and the canonical virtual molecular orbitals ( vmos ) as @xmath39 .",
    "the oscillator orbitals are non - orthogonal among each other ; their overlap integral can be evaluated using the idempotency of the projectors :    @xmath40    note that the overlap matrix @xmath41 is of size @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number of projected oscillator orbitals .",
    "the poos can be expanded in terms of a set of orthonormalized virtual orbitals ( _ e.g. _  the set of canonical virtuals ) .",
    "although later we eliminate explicit reference to the set of virtual orbitals of the fock / kohn - sham operator ( _ i.e. _  everything will be written only in terms of the occupied orbitals or equivalently in terms of the corresponding density matrix ) , with the help of the resolution of identity , we give the explicit form of the coefficient matrix linking the poos with the virtuals :    @xmath44    the matrix @xmath45 is constructed simply from the elements of the occupied / virtual block of the position operator , @xmath46 .",

    "the dispersion coefficients obtained from lda and pbe orbitals are strongly overestimated .",
    "it is not really surprising in view of the rather diffuse nature of dfa orbitals and their tendency to underestimate the occupied / virtual gap . due to the fact that lda and pbe lead to local potentials , the operator and matrix algebra results are very similar :",
    "their difference is smaller than the supposed experimental uncertainty of the dosd dispersion coefficients ( few percent ) .",
    "it is quite clear from figure  [ fig : errors ] that the errors for the molecules containing second - row elements are considerably higher than for most of the molecules composed of h , c , n , o and f atoms .",
    "notable exceptions are the and molecules .",
    "the performance of the method is significantly better for orbitals obtained by nonlocal exchange : rhf and rshlda . in the latter case",

    "in contrast to the pure dfa calculations , the matrix and operator algebra methods differ for the rhf and rsh methods significantly : the mean absolute error and the standard deviation of the error is increased by a factor of 2 or 3 .",
    "this deterioration of the quality of the results reflects the fact that in the operator algebra approach the commutator of the position and non - local exchange operators is neglected ( see appendix  [ app : fockian ] ) , while this effect is automatically taken into account in the matrix algebra calculations . in view of the simplicity of the model and of its fully ab initio character",
    ", the best me%e of about 11% seems to be very promising and indicates that further work in this direction is worthwhile .",
    "it has been shown that , using projected dipolar oscillator orbitals to represent the virtual space in a localized orbital context , the equations involved in long - range ring coupled cluster doubles type rpa calculations can be formulated without explicit knowledge of the virtual orbital set .",
    "the poo virtuals have been constructed directly from the localized occupied orbitals .",
    "the fockian matrix elements and the electron repulsion integrals were evaluated using only the elements of the occupied block of the fock / kohn - sham matrix in lmo basis and from simple multipole integrals between occupied lmos .",
    "an interesting feature of the model is that , as far as one uses boys localized orbitals and first - order dipolar oscillator orbitals , practically all the emerging quantities can be expressed by the overlap integral between two oscillator orbitals , which happens to be the matrix element of the dipole moment fluctuation operator .",
    "various levels of approximations have been considered for the long - range rpa energy leading finally to a pairwise additive dispersion energy formula with a non - emprirical expression for the bond - bond c@xmath3 dispersion coefficient . at this simplest level",
    "a straightforward relationship has been unraveled between the ring coupled cluster and the dielectric matrix formulations of the long - range rpa correlation energy .",
    "our derivation , starting from the quantum chemical rpa correlation energy and pursuing a hierarchy of simplifying assumptions , has led us to a dispersion energy expression which is in a straightforward analogy with classical van der waals energy formulae .",
    "our procedure produces an explicit model , derived from the wave function of the system , for the dynamical polarizabilities associated with the building blocks , which are bonds , lone pairs and in general localized electron pairs .",
    "thus one arrives to the quantum chemical analogs of the `` quantum harmonic oscillators '' ( qho ) appearing in the semiclassical theory of dispersion forces , elaborated within a rpa framework by tkatchenko , ambrosetti , di stasio and their coworkers @xcite .    a promising perspective of the projected oscillator orbital approach concerns the description of dispersion forces in plane wave calculations for solids .",
    "much effort has been spent recently in finding a compact representation of the dielectric matrix in plane wave calculations , @xcite but it still remains a bottleneck for a really fast non - empirical calculation of the long - range correlation energy .",
    "projected oscillator orbitals may offer an opportunity to construct extremely compact representations of a part of the conduction band , which contributes the most to the local dipolar excitations at the origin of van der waals forces .",
    "however , this approach is probably limited to relatively large gap semiconductors , where the construction of the maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwf ) , @xcite which are the solid - state analogs of the boys localized orbitals , is a convergent procedure .",
    "such a methodology could become a fully non - empirical variant of silvestrelli s extension of the tkatchenko - scheffler approach for mlwfs  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present work has been to describe the principal features of the formalism , without extensive numerical applications . however , the first rudimentary numerical tests on the molecular c@xmath3 coefficients have indicated that the results are quite plausible in spite of the simplifying approximations and it is reasonable to expect that more sophisticated variants of the method will improve the quality of the model . in view of the modest computational costs and the fully ab initio character of the projected oscillator orbital approach applied at various approximation levels of the rpa ,",
    "which is able to describe dispersion forces even beyond a pairwise additive scheme , the full numerical implementation of the presently outlined methodology have certainly a great potential for the treatment of london dispersion forces in the context of density functional theory .",
