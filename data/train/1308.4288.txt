    "the formal study of dynamical systems was initiated by poincar @xcite , who , among his many contributions , importantly introduced in 1885 the notion of a _ bifurcation _ @xcite , which denotes a dramatic alteration in the dynamical properties of a system upon a change in one or more of the parameters that define it .",
    "bifurcation theory is largely concerned with algebraic classification of the critical values of appropriately defined bifurcation parameters @xcite . in recent years",
    ", this classical approach has been augmented by the introduction of powerful group theoretic tools for examination of previously unappreciated symmetries of the governing equations and phase space solutions of many important classes of dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the presence of these symmetries leads to an often significant simplification of the description of the system s dynamics ( akin to dimensional reduction ) . in this manuscript ,",
    "i introduce a novel and completely general form of local bifurcation analysis that is based on recognition of the fundamental nature of the topological cycles ( and their symmetries ) that arise from consideration of dynamical systems as interaction networks .",
    "this unique viewpoint stems from the synthesis of several disparate notions associated with the diverse fields of chemistry ( generalized reactions / stoichiometries , cycles ) , control theory ( routh - hurwitz conditions , routh array root counting ) , mathematics ( combinatorics , topology , graph theory ) , and physics ( dimensional reduction of the parameters that define the network ) .",
    "further elaboration of the connection of the properties of a network s _ bipartite _ cycles as presented below ( including their symmetries and their implications for dimensional reduction of the problem of local stability ) with classical bifurcation theory @xcite and with the seemingly orthogonal symmetries corresponding to a network",
    "s governing equations and their phase space solutions ( including their group properties and implications for dimensional reduction ) @xcite represents an interesting challenge for the future .",
    "topological approaches for understanding dynamical systems ( interaction networks ) come in two flavors : the study of the topology of the network s possible phase space trajectories ( _ phase space topology _ , for which poincar also famously laid the foundations @xcite ) and the distinct study of the topological structure of a network s interactions ( _ interaction topology _ ) . in this manuscript",
    ", i will use the word `` topology '' only in the latter sense of referring to the structure of a network s interactions .",
    "such topological approaches have had a long yet relatively sparse history of successful application to real - world networks , beginning with kirchhoff s current and voltage laws from 1847 @xcite , which were significantly generalized by weyl in 1923 @xcite and , independently , tellegen in 1952 @xcite .",
    "another important example is stueckelberg s 1952 proof that quantum mechanical unitarity already entails bilateral normalization , cyclic recurrence , and boltzmann s @xmath0 theorem @xcite .    over the past half century , topological methods have come to play an important role in particular for the study of chemical reaction networks , with the diverse pioneering studies of king & altmann @xcite , bak @xcite , morowitz et al .",

    "in 1972 , horn & jackson @xcite and feinberg @xcite importantly proved that the unipartite graphs that convey a chemical network s _ complex topology _ , in which reactant complex nodes are connected to product complex nodes through transition edges , can be used to address the number and stability of the steady states of certain classes of mass action networks @xcite .",
    "this ultimately master equation - based approach was already implicit in stueckelberg s proof mentioned above ; for example , feinberg s `` zero deficiency theorem '' @xcite is a direct consequence of stueckelberg s more general proof based on the network s _ configuration topology _ @xcite . in a contemporaneous yet orthogonal direction , volpert in 1972 @xcite , and",
    "independently clarke in 1974 @xcite , introduced the formal study of the bipartite graphs that convey a chemical reaction network s _ stoichiometric topology _ , with separate nodes for the species and reactions and with edges displaying reactant or product stoichiometries .",
    "this early work , along with further work in the 70 s and 80 s by volpert and his collaborators @xcite and by clarke @xcite , collectively demonstrated the usefulness of the stoichiometric topology for examination of steady state multiplicity and stability in particular for mass action networks . a contemporaneous and highly reductionist approach based on a network s unipartite _ logical topology _ ( or `` kinetic logic '' ) , which displays the positive / negative effect of one species on another according to the original governing equations , was first explored by glass & kauffman in 1973 @xcite and later by thomas @xcite and king @xcite . another minimal and completely general perspective originally inspired by economic models was proposed by quirk , ruppert , & maybee in the late 60 s @xcite and later comprehensively addressed by jeffries @xcite .",
    "this approach involves examination of a network s sign stability , requiring knowledge only of the signs of the terms in the network s jacobian matrix obtained upon first - order perturbation of the steady state ( _ sign topology _ ) .",
    "clarke examined some of the implications of sign stability for chemical reaction networks in 1980 @xcite ; see do et al .",
    "@xcite for more recent results on the general problem of sign stability .",
    "the overly simplified perspectives utilized by both the sign and logical topologies , however , prohibit more detailed examinations of network stability .",
    "it is important to note that the strongest and most useful results from all of the above studies on chemical networks were obtained only under the assumption of mass action kinetics , which restricts the reaction functions to positive products of reactant concentrations raised to stoichiometric exponents .    in the above summary",
    ", five different topological interpretations of chemical networks ( and , in some cases , more general networks ) have been mentioned based on a network s sign , logical , configuration , complex , and stoichiometric topologies . in this manuscript ,",
    "a distinct and completely general interpretation is explored based on a network s perturbative _ influence topology _ , which naturally emerges from examination of the first order perturbation of a network steady state .",
    "the influence topology corresponds to a signed directed bipartite graph with a _ jacobian _",
    "edge from a species node to a reaction node encoding whether the reaction function increases ( arrow ) or decreases ( blunt arrow ) upon an increase in the species in the vicinity of the steady state ( positive / negative reaction derivative with respect to the species ) , and a _ stoichiometric _ edge from a reaction node to a species node encoding the positive ( arrow ) or negative ( blunt arrow ) sign of the species - specific stoichiometric factor for the reaction in the original governing equations ( positive / negative stoichiometric coefficient ) . the complex , stoichiometric , and influence topologies are displayed in fig .",

    "the influence topology represents a completely general yet still intuitive mathematical structure . here , a directed path from species @xmath1 to @xmath2 through reaction @xmath3 consists of a jacobian edge followed by a stoichiometric edge , with their product yielding the net positive / negative contribution of reaction @xmath3 to the growth rate of species @xmath2 upon perturbation of species @xmath1 in the vicinity of the steady state .",
    "unlike the more familiar complex and stoichiometric topologies , the usefulness of the influence topology is not restricted to mass action kinetics or even to the non - negativity of the species or reactions . as shown in detail below , the influence topology provides a simple and powerful calculational tool with which the local stability of _ arbitrary _ first - order networks can be determined .",
    "it importantly reveals the hierarchical influence of first topology and then algebra on a network s local stability , with significant dynamical restrictions already imposed at the topological level . in the following sections , a general derivation of the influence topology",
    "is given followed by its detailed application to the study of local steady state stability for several classical networks .",
    ", however these coefficients are needed to define the influence topology , which represents a generalized form of the original network .",
    "the @xmath1 subscript in the @xmath4 parameters of the governing equations labels the different reactions @xmath5 that appear in the topological graphs .",

    "in very recent work , angeli et al . examine various stability criteria that lead to algebraic and/or topological rules for exclusion of the appearence of instabilities within certain classes of networks @xcite ; however , they do not analyze the completely general and fundamental stability criteria provided by the routh - hurwitz conditions @xcite .",
    "the implications of the routh - hurwitz conditions for chemical networks were already recognized by bak @xcite and later examined in depth , both algebraically and topologically , for mass action networks by clarke @xcite , with wilhelm @xcite more recently emphasizing their general nature . in this manuscript ,",
    "i demonstrate that the dimensionally reduced influence topology provides an efficient calculational tool for direct study of these fundamental criteria for completely arbitrary networks . due to this novel perspective",

    "what is perhaps most striking in the above treatment is the dramatic dimensional reduction often possible , with the many different reaction constants that define the original network reduced to only one or a few parameters for analysis of its stability .",
    "for example , the nine reaction parameters plus three initial conditions that define the jenkin - maxwell network were reduced to two influence topology parameters , which , due to their symmetry , could be further reduced to a stability criterion based only on a single symmetrized parameter .",

    "stoichiometry has been heavily emphasized in the past , almost always under the additional assumption of mass action kinetics @xcite . for more general networks ,",
    "however , the stoichiometric coefficients provide only a limited perspective on network stability .",
    "as demonstrated above , the notions of stoichiometric scaling and , even more significantly , cycle compaction prove that variables other than the individual stoichiometric terms are often more suitable for examining a given network s stability . upon cycle compaction , multiple stoichiometric terms often end up being degenerate with themselves or , even more interestingly , with co - compacted jacobian terms ( e.g. see the jenkin - maxwell , van der pol , and lotka - volterra influence topologies presented above ) .",
    "approaches for determining the number of steady states have received more attention in the past than methods for testing steady state stability .",
    "it should be noted that all of the networks considered in this paper have ( or can have , in the case of the repressilator ) only a single steady state solution no matter the values of the parameters that define the network .",
    "whether this single steady state can become unstable and exactly how it becomes unstable ( e.g. through a hopf bifurcation ) is then the interesting question , not steady state multiplicity ( which , for the networks considered above , is trivial ) .",
    "it should nevertheless be noted that for more general networks that share the same influence topology as the networks considered above ( e.g. lotka - volterra - like networks ) , multiple steady state solutions may be possible depending on the exact form that the reaction functions take , but all of these steady states would still have to lie somewhere on the ( unchanged ) stability phase space .",
    "for an in depth analysis of steady state multiplicity using the influence topology , see the work of banaji & craciun @xcite .",
    "as presented above , the influence topology allows generalization of classical networks to a much larger class sharing the same signs of the reaction stoichiometries and their derivatives with respect to each species .",
    "for example , the lotka - volterra network was generalized to its influence topology graph , which in actuality represents a much larger class of `` lotka - volterra - like '' networks .",
    "such generalizations have always played an important role in deepening our understanding of mathematical objects .",
    "while studying the set of all possible interaction networks makes no sense , the set of all possible _ influence topologies _ is denumerable and can therefore be systematically studied .",
    "one can imagine writing down this complete set for a certain fixed number of @xmath7 species and @xmath99 reactions and then constructing and examining the associated stability phase space for each individual influence topology .",
    "how to actually go about algorithmically enumerating all possible signed directed bipartite graphs comprised purely of interconnected cycles ( and , therefore , _ fundamental _ influence topologies ) for a fixed number of @xmath7 species and @xmath99 reactions while avoiding repeats presents a significant challenge . aside from this issue",
    ", even a small number of species and reactions will generate a lengthy list due to the @xmath400 different possible unique sign assignments for the @xmath147 jacobian and @xmath148 stoichiometric edges for a given directed bipartite graph .",
    "however , the following sign degeneracy significantly reduces this list .",
    "consider a single influence topology graph displaying the positive / negative connections among species \\{@xmath124,  ,@xmath401 } and reactions \\{@xmath128, ",
    ",@xmath402}. for the species node @xmath124 , we can make the variable substitution @xmath403 . that this leads to negation of all its associated edges in the influence topology is simple to show .",
    "all jacobian arrows emanating from node @xmath404 are transformed to @xmath405 ; all stoichiometric arrows pointing to node @xmath404 are also negated as the governing equation for species 1 is now @xmath406 .",
    "now consider the reaction node substitution @xmath407 .",
    "all jacobian arrows that point to this reaction are negated , @xmath408 ; all stoichiometric arrows that emanate from this reaction will also be negated , as one can see from the governing equations , @xmath409 . note that both substitutions merely represent a definitional degree of freedom of the network variables , with no affect on the network dynamics ( the influence topology does not _ explicitly _ depend on the @xmath104 and @xmath100 ) .",
    "the presence of this sign degeneracy significantly reduces the list of all possible unique influence topologies . for @xmath7-cycle networks ,",
    "this sign degeneracy is consistent with the fact that only two different types of networks are possible : it is easy to show that the directed edges of any @xmath7 cycle network can be transformed by sign substitutions into either all arrows ( @xmath225 ) or a single blunt arrow and the rest arrows ( @xmath227 ) . for more general networks , the development of an efficient ( topological ? ) algorithm to prove that one influence topology is sign - homomorphic to another would clearly be helpful .    in attempting to write down",
    "_ the _ influence topology for the van der pol network above , we discovered that it depends on the particular algebraic expression of its governing equations . in this case , two different algebraic versions ( the li@xmath79nard - transformed version and a canonically transformed version ) led to influence topologies that differed by only a single link , with the simpler network entailing significantly fewer dimensions to describe its complete stability phase space .",
    "this immediately suggests the notion of a _ minimal _ influence topology for a given network with an associated stability phase space having the fewest possible dimensions ; it may of course be degenerate with other similarly minimal topologies , though some of this degeneracy could be removed by the adoption of further criteria such as the influence topology with the smallest cycles , least number of cycles , and/or the least number of each type of edges . for the van der pol network , the simpler topology ( and also minimal ? ) was connected to the more complicated one through addition of a single edge in the influence topology .",
    "whether more complicated influence topologies for a given network can always be constructed from the minimal topology through the addition of edges ( and also reaction nodes ) is an interesting question , and one that could easily be disproved by counterexample .",
    "the development of algorithms that allow one to find the minimal influence topology ( or degenerate set of minimal influence topologies ) for a given set of governing equations is a highly interesting open problem .",
    "the influence topology should be especially useful for systems biology and for the de novo construction of biological networks in synthetic biology .",
    "detailed information about biological reaction functions beyond the signs of their stoichiometries and monotonicities is often unavailable ( e.g. unknown hill coefficient @xcite , complicated transcriptional promoter regulation ) or sometimes interesting to ignore ( e.g. for robustness studies @xcite ) .",
    "the principal benefit of the influence topology is the readily accessible constraints it provides on a given network s possible dynamics , revealing the potential to shift a steady state from stability to instability ( or vice versa ) as well as what types of transitions are possible ( e.g. it provides necessary conditions for a hopf bifurcation ) . from a synthetic biology perspective",
    ", the stabilization or destabilization of a network in a way that preserves its influence topology could , for example , be achieved through modification of a particular reaction s cooperativity ( e.g. as assessed by its hill coefficient ) and therefore the steepness of a given reaction jacobian .    in this manuscript ,",
    "six distinct topological interpretations of interaction networks were mentioned .",
