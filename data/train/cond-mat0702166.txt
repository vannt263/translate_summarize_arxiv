    "in addition , due to the ` bottleneck effect ' ,  @xcite the relaxation of polaritons to the zero momentum state was delayed , hindering the creation of a thermal population in the lowest energy states .",
    "the first investigation of the coherence properties of emitted light above the threshold for non - linear emission in strong coupling was based on the measurement  @xcite of the second order coherence function , @xmath36 , which would take a value of @xmath37 for a thermal state , and @xmath38 for a coherent state  @xcite . a decrease of @xmath39 from @xmath40 to @xmath41 as pumping power was increased from threshold to @xmath42 times threshold power was seen in a system of @xmath43 gaas quantum wells placed at the antinodes of light in a gaas / algaas microcavity , giving @xmath44mev rabi splitting .",

    "analysis of the time dependence showed that , below threshold , the dynamics of the @xmath46 polaritons follows closely the population of cold reservoir excitons ; the relaxation from high energy exciton states resonant with the pump to these reservoir exciton states had a characteristic relaxation time of @xmath47ps .",
    "[ note that this time is significantly shorter than the @xmath48ps observed in similar experiments  @xcite with gaas based microcavities . ] above the non - linear threshold , the population of the reservoir excitons was found to be clamped , and the polariton relaxation dynamics became faster , with the maximum of polariton emission at @xmath49ps delay after the initial pulse .",

    "the first evidence of spontaneous first - order coherence in an incoherently pumped microcavity was seen in a 16 qw cdte microcavity with 26mev rabi splitting  @xcite under non - resonant pulsed pumping .",
    "an interesting feature of this particular experiment was that the non - linear emission was at @xmath50 and so resulted in an emission ring at an angle of around @xmath51 ; this was associated with the small size of the excitation spot ( 3 @xmath52 m ) .",
    "( note that in later experiments with larger excitation spots on the same sample condensation was at @xmath46  @xcite . )",

    "progress came from observing  @xcite that thermalisation processes due to particle - particle scattering can be dramatically increased both by increasing the value of the ( non - resonant ) pump power , and also by positively detuning the cavity energy above the excitonic energy .",
    "large positive detuning makes polaritons more excitonic and increases their scattering rate .",
    "time- and angle - resolved spectroscopy on a sample consisting of 12 gaas qws characterised by 14.4mev rabi splitting  @xcite showed that for positively detuned cases , where the thermalisation time increases while decay time decreases , the thermalisation time can reach around one tenth of the polariton lifetime and that lower polaritons remain in thermal equilibrium with the phonon bath for a period of about 20ps .",
    "finally , a comprehensive set of experiments showing clear evidence for condensation of cavity polaritons was performed in a cdte  @xcite structure consisting of 16 quantum wells giving 26mev rabi splitting . above the threshold pumping density they observed : a massive occupation of the @xmath55 mode developing from a polariton gas in thermal equilibrium at 19k ( shown in fig .",

    "linear polarisation had been predicted to appear in the condensed state  @xcite , and its appearance gives evidence for the single state nature of the condensate , though since the direction of this polarisation was pinned to a crystallographic direction the polarisation direction symmetry was not spontaneously broken .",
    "evidence that the polarisation of light is pinned to one of the crystallographic axes , independently of the excitation polarisation , was also independently observed in experiments on both cdte  @xcite and ingaas microcavities  @xcite .",

[ sec : boson - ferm - gener ] , excitonic disorder is on much shorter length scales ( typically of the order of ten nanometres for cdte ) , and thus does not affect the spatial polariton density profile ; however excitonic disorder does have a significant impact on the distribution of excitonic oscillator strengths .",

    "this point is worth stressing , as the electromagnetic interaction between excitons is split between the direct coulomb term , and a photon mediated term .",

    "the relation between coulomb interaction and photon mediated interaction is complicated here because the resonant photons are confined by the dbr ( distributed bragg reflector ) mirrors , while the static coulomb term is modified much less strongly by the mirrors . when one comes to exciton states",

    "the differences between these effective hamiltonians can be seen as the result of regarding different terms as important ; i.e.  which terms are treated exactly , and which perturbatively . in both cases ,",
    "the first step involves changing from electrons and holes to bound excitons  i.e.  solving the wavefunction for the relative coordinates .",

    ". however , the different models emphasise different features : the boson model can effectively describe the case where the dominant interactions are exciton - exciton coulomb interactions , while the boson - fermion model instead has the saturation of the exciton - photon coupling as the dominant interaction . as such , these different models may be appropriate in different contexts .",

    "there are a wide variety of approaches that may be applied to study one or either of these features ; in the following we discuss briefly how some of these various approaches are related , and what limitations they may have . for a more general discussion",
    "see e.g.refs .",
    "@xcite .    in order to describe the properties of the pumped , decaying system ,",
    "one requires a method to calculate various correlation functions .",
    "given an expression for single particle correlation functions , one may then find many properties of interest , for example the occupation of modes , the luminescence and absorption spectra , and the first - order coherence properties .",
    "the most general information about one particle correlations can be written in terms of the two correlation functions @xmath197 , @xmath198 , which with @xmath199 describing the photon field correspond directly to luminescence and absorption probabilities .",
    "these encode information both about the form of the spectrum and thus the density of states , and also about the population of those states .",
    "for example , the density of states is given by @xmath200 $ ] , where the retarded green s function can be written as : @xmath201 $ ] .",
    "in equilibrium , these two greens functions can be related in terms of the thermal distribution function , but out of equilibrium no such simplification is possible .",
    "let us now discuss different methods to calculate these green s functions .",
    "the first method is to find and solve the operator equations of motion for @xmath202 , and thus to evaluate the correlation functions directly . in order to describe pumping and decay",
    ", one considers coupling the system to baths , which either pump particles and energy into the system , or provide modes into which particles may decay .",
    "these baths are assumed to be large , so their properties ( e.g. distribution functions ) are fixed , and not affected by the system . since the bath and system are coupled , the equations of motion for the system operators will also include bath operators . if one considers the initial state of the bath to be drawn from some fixed ( e.g.  thermal ) distribution , then the expectation of bath operators will be random quantities , with statistical properties set by the bath s distribution  @xcite ; thus such coupling to baths introduces noise , giving quantum langevin equations  @xcite .",
    "the second method is to write equations of motion for green s functions , which will now involve correlation functions of bath operators , which again can be found if one assumes a fixed distribution for the baths .",
    "these coupled equations are the content of the keldysh formalism  @xcite , in which it turns out to be simpler to write equations for various linear combinations of the green s functions , allowing one to combine the green s functions in a compact matrix notation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the equations for the green s functions can also be derived in a path integral formulation  @xcite . the path integral formalism allows one to make a close connection with the methods discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : therm - equil - vs ] , and can describe changes to both the occupation and to the spectrum induced by pumping and decay  @xcite . as such",
    ", it allows one to introduce a complex self - consistency condition ( i.e.  a complex equivalent of the gross - pitaevskii equation ) ; this interpolates between the laser , in which self - consistency requires balancing of pumping and decay , and the equilibrium condensate , where self - consistency instead relates real self - energy shifts .",
    "this point will be discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase - degree - freedom ] .",
    "the above two approaches allow one to find self - consistently the population and the spectrum in the presence of pumping and decay . in certain cases",
    " for example in the normal state , with weak pumping and decay  the changes to the spectrum may be small , and one is interested primarily in changes to the population . by assuming a known form for the retarded green s function ( i.e.for the spectrum of the system ) it is possible to extract equations for the population from the green s function formalism ( see ref .",
    "* chapter 9 ) for details ) .",
    "these will lead to the boltzmann equation  @xcite , which may also be derived phenomenologically , by considering various rates of transfer between different energies .",
    "thus , by neglecting the `` kinetic '' effects , that change the spectrum , but retaining `` dynamic '' effects , that change the populations , one may investigate how pumping and decay change the occupation of the spectrum  @xcite . even without pumping and decay ,",
    "the spectrum changes due to interactions in the condensed state  @xcite ; and further calculations retaining `` kinetic '' effects suggest the pumping and decay further modify the spectrum ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and also ref .",
    "@xcite in a different context ) . because changes to the spectrum modify the density of states ,",
    "they can be expected to in turn affect the population dynamics ; it is therefore not clear how valid it is to consider population dynamics in the condensed system without self - consistent treatment of the changes to the spectrum .",
    "a different approach to treating the coupling to baths is to consider the density matrix , which allows calculation of any single - time expectation of operators , as well as certain multi - time correlations , discussed further below .",
    "calculating the full @xmath9-body density matrix allows calculation of correlation functions of arbitrary numbers of particles , rather than just the single particle correlations discussed above .",
    "density matrix methods , and green s functions methods can be related as the single - particle density matrix ( i.e.  tracing over coordinates of all but one particle ) is equivalent to the equal time part of the one particle green s function .    to numerically calculate evolution of the density matrix , due both to the system hamiltonian , and to the effect of coupling to baths",
    ", one can choose an appropriate basis and write the density matrix in terms of a distribution function over this basis , i.e.  @xmath203 .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix then corresponds to the time evolution of this distribution function . under certain conditions",
    "@xcite , it is possible to interpret the evolution of this distribution as describing evolution of a quasi - probability distribution . in such a case ,",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath204 is a fokker - planck equation , and can be rewritten in terms of langevin equations for classical variables . if one chooses to resolve the density matrix onto a basis of coherent states , a variety of ways of doing this exist , among which we mention two important choices : the positive p distribution , and the wigner distribution ( see  @xcite for other possible choices , and further details ) .",
    "the positive p distribution formally has the desired properties , and gives the desired langevin equations , but is numerically unstable when applied to the kind of problem discussed here  @xcite . the wigner distribution ,",
    "although not technically matching the above requirements , can have its equation of motion approximated  the truncated wigner representation  @xcite  which allows one to find appropriate langevin equations , and is numerically stable .",
    "the wigner distribution allows one to find the expectation of symmetrised products of operators ; at equal times it is trivial to extend this to find general products of operators , by making use of equal time commutation relations .",
    "it is also possible to find multi - time correlation functions from such an approach , however since the unequal time commutation relations are not a - priori known , one can not generally find expectations of other orders ; in this sense the truncated wigner approach does not allow @xmath205 and @xmath206 , but only the symmetrised combination @xmath207 , and hence can not separate the density of states from its occupation .",
    "condensation , coherence and superfluidity are often connected , however when dealing with two - dimensional systems of composite particles , where finite - size and non - equilibrium effects may be important , it is important to separate and clarify these concepts .",
    "the discussion below compares condensation , coherence and superfluidity in equilibrium infinite systems to the case including finite - size and non - equilibrium effects . for simplicity",
    "we discuss these ideas in terms of a general bosonic field @xmath208 , rather than any specific field appearing in the microcavity polariton system .",
    "the first concept is macroscopic occupation of single - particle wave - function ; rigorously this can be defined as the existence of a macroscopic eigenvalue of the reduced one - particle density matrix  @xcite : @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the occupation of the single - particle mode @xmath211 . a macroscopic eigenvalue exists if @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the total number of particles . in an infinite system ,",
    "if the macroscopically occupied state is an extended state , then there is _ off diagonal long range order _",
    " i.e.  if in the position representation @xmath214 . in a non - interacting two - dimensional trapped ( and thus finite ) gas of bosons",
    "there can be a sharp crossover to a state with a macroscopic eigenvalue ( i.e.  of the order of the number of particles ) of the one - particle density matrix  @xcite .",
    "however , the single - particle state @xmath215 to which this eigenvalue corresponds will be a state localised in the trap , and so despite the existence of a macroscopic eigenvalue , @xmath216 .",
    "the visibility of interference fringes is directly related to the first - order coherence function @xmath217 , where : @xmath218 coherence can be defined by the properties of this function . as just discussed , if one defines coherence by the limit of @xmath219 , then in a trapped system , this function vanishes .",
    "however , coherence will exist across the size of the trap .",
    "in such inhomogeneous and complicated cases , a binary classification of coherent / incoherent is less useful than a description of how the coherence varies as a function of separation in time and space .",
    "both the size of this variation , and its functional form will depend on the interplay of finite size ( and form of trapping potential ) , temperature , interactions , and decay rates  @xcite .",
    "superfluidity can meanwhile be defined separately as the difference of longitudinal and transverse response functions at vanishing wave - vector  @xcite : @xmath220 and @xmath221 $ ] . since superfluidity results from a change of the response functions",
    ", it occurs only in an interacting system ; without interaction bosons do not become superfluid . in a two - dimensional infinite interacting system , below the bkt transition  @xcite , coherence decays as a power law rather than an exponential  low energy phase fluctuations prevent true long range order  @xcite  and superfluidity exists , but no macroscopic occupation of a single mode .",
    "when one considers a more realistic system , which is both interacting , but also of finite extent , one can not ignore a - priori the physics of the bkt transition , nor can one ignore a - priori the physics of the trap . at low enough temperatures",
    "it is clear there will be macroscopic occupation of a single mode , and full coherence across the trap .",
    "how this state is approached as temperature is reduced , or as density is increased differs depending on whether interactions or finite size effects are dominant .",
    "if described as a non - interacting gas , the coherence at all distances increases uniformly as a single mode is increasingly occupied  @xcite . in the bkt scenario ,",
    "power law correlations develop on intermediate scales ( between some short range thermal length and the trap size ) ; then as temperature decreases , the thermal length increases and the power with which correlations decay decreases , again restoring full coherence as @xmath222  @xcite , as shown in fig .",

    "the long wavelength phase modes , responsible for decay of correlations become diffusive .",
    "i.e.  the poles of the green s functions , which in the equilibrium case have the form @xmath223 , take instead the form @xmath224 in the pumped and decaying case .",

    "it is worth mentioning here a few other important distinctions between lasing and the generalised concept of condensation discussed here , as there are evidently also similarities  @xcite .",
    "most obviously , polariton condensation is seen at the polariton resonance , which is significantly ( of the order of the rabi splitting @xmath23 ) below the lowest cavity photon mode ; as such nonlinear emission coexisting with strong coupling is a signal that one should consider polaritons , and not just photon lasing .",
    "a more fundamental difference is that lasing requires inversion , while condensation does not ; this is a consequence of the standard laser systems possessing little coherence in the gain medium , while excitons , being part of a coherent polaritons , are coherent  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : gpe - fermi ] ) . in the presence of pumping and decay ,",
    "the susceptibility ( describing the nonlinear response of excitons ) becomes complex  @xcite ; the real part of the susceptibility gives the nonlinearity in the gross - pitaevskii equation .",

    "a treatment of a model system with pumping and decay elegantly shows how these conditions can be combined , giving an expression in terms of the total susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "starting from the strong - coupling regime , when crossing over to the weak - coupling regime ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , the polariton splitting collapses , and so the lasing mode no longer has any excitonic character , and becomes the standard photon laser .",
    "a major advantage of an exciton - polariton laser over standard lasers is that it can operate without the inversion of the electronic population  @xcite , and therefore it has a much smaller threshold pump power .",
    "it is interesting to note that wide band gap semiconductors , such as gan and zno , would be particularly suitable as in these cases excitons are stable at higher temperatures and densities , and therefore they could operate at room temperature .",
    "electronic population inversion is not necessary because in the exciton - polariton laser , both photon field and excitons are coherent . in addition , the involvement of the excitonic field leads to strong nonlinear effects compared to conventional lasers , due to exciton - exciton interactions .",

    "this section in contrast will review a few of the phenomena that have been predicted as possible signatures and properties of a polariton condensate .      within a given model , and effective description of the environment ,",

    "@xcite . in that experiment",
    "the circular polarisation component of the signal was studied as a function of pumping strength , for both linear and circular polarisation .",
    "it was found that , for a linear pump , there is a maximum of the degree of circular signal polarisation near the nonlinear threshold . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this effect can be understood as a competition between two effects ; self - induced larmor precession , which rotates the pseudospin describing the polarisation from linear to circular polarisation , and stimulated scattering to the ground state : far above threshold , the rate of scattering to the ground state is too high to allow time for any change of polarisation in the pump mode .",

    "this experiment showed that , just above threshold , the signal was elliptical , with the major axis ( the direction of the linear component ) rotated with respect to the linear polarisation of the pump  i.e.  the direction of major axis depended on the direction of polarisation of the pump , but the angle between the two directions was not constant .",
    "in addition , the degree of linear polarisation of the signal decreased far above threshold ( as well as the degree of circular polarisation as observed in ref .",
    "this rotation was reproduced in a model combining precession due to static and self - induced ( larmor ) splittings ( including an extra in - plane splitting , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) as well as spin rotation in stimulated polariton - polariton scattering .",
    "the reduction of linear polarisation far above threshold was explained by rapid self - induced larmor precession , which rotates the linear polarisation direction so rapidly that it averages to zero .",
    "microcavity polaritons and their condensation are related to the physics of two - component atomic fermi gases near feshbach resonances . in particular , the crossover from a fluctuation dominated phase boundary to a mean - field phase boundary with increasing polariton density is closely related to the bec - bcs crossover recently studied in these atomic gases  @xcite . for atomic gases ,",
    "in contrast to polariton experiments , the density of particles is typically kept fixed , while the interaction strength is varied via magnetically tunable feshbach resonances , allowing one to go from a bec of bound molecules to a bcs state of fermionic pairs .",
    "the interaction strength is tuned by changing the detuning between the zero of energy for pairs of atoms in their original spin states , and a closed channel resonance level of atoms in some higher energy spin configuration ( see ref  @xcite and refs therein for more details ) .    the bose - fermi model used for polaritons and described in section  [ sec : boson - ferm - gener ]",
    "is very similar to the model initially proposed for the description of the bec - bcs crossover in atomic fermi gases  @xcite .",
    "the fermionic operators @xmath294 in the polariton model , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dicke - model - fermions ] ) , are analogous to the two spin species of atoms in the feshbach resonance model ; the photon is analogous to the closed channel resonance level ; the dipole interaction relates to the hyperfine interaction ; and the polariton to the feshbach molecule .",
    "there are , however , a number of important differences between the two models ; most notably the absence of a direct four - fermion interaction in the polariton model , and the existence of an energy dependence , and a distribution , of exciton - photon coupling strengths .",
    "secondly there is a marked difference of mass ratios : for polaritons , the photon mass is typically a factor of @xmath295 times smaller than the exciton mass ; in the feshbach case the closed channel resonance has a dispersion controlled by a mass which is twice the atomic mass .",
    "note also that there is a difference in interpretation between the photon and the closed channel resonance level in feshbach resonance .",
    "although inside the microcavity a photon is not an eigenstate  the upper and lower polaritons are instead eigenstates  outside the cavity it is possible to physically separate the photons from excitons .",
    "similarly , the closed channel resonance level is not an eigenstate ; however , in distinction from the photon , it can not be physically separated from the other two - body states to which it is coupled : in general one can not have a given molecular resonance level in isolation from other molecular states .",
    "another difference between the systems comes in how the gap equation [ i.e.  eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpe - fermi ] ) ] , and constraint on the density can be used to find chemical potential and temperature : in the mean - field ( bcs ) limit of the atomic case , the closed channel resonance level lies at high energies , the chemical potential lies well within the band of fermionic states , and so the density depends only on chemical potential , and not on temperature . in the polariton model , the chemical potential remains below the bottom of the band of fermionic states , and so both temperature and chemical potential influence the density .",
    "rather , the fluctuation dominated ( bec ) to mean - field ( bcs ) crossover of the polariton model is in the nature of which excitations are responsible for depopulating the condensate at finite temperatures .",
    "another issue worth considering is that further analysis has questioned the need to use the bose - fermi model in applications to experimentally relevant feshbach resonances .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the molecules created in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance are halo dimers extending over large distances in which the closed channel admixture is tiny .",
    "thus , the resonance level acts to enhance the effective interaction between fermionic pairs , but the crossover to loosely bound molecules does not rely on the macroscopic occupation of this level ( as was initially suggested ) .",
    "since the resonance level is not significantly occupied , it was shown , by using realistic atomic potentials  @xcite , that the bcs - bec crossover in atomic fermi gases near feshbach resonances is of the same nature as originally considered by leggett  @xcite .",
    "that is , it is based on the smooth crossover of the pair size and not on the macroscopic occupation of the resonance level .",
    "thus , microcavity polariton experiments in the normal operating conditions of large photon field occupation present the first experimental realisation of the bec - bcs crossover which differs substantially from the original scenario  @xcite .    finally , it is interesting to note that the same idea of parametric scattering and amplification in a resonant pumping configuration as is described in sec .

    "there are areas in which our discussion has been brief because some questions have only been partially addressed to date : questions about hydrodynamics in such partially coherent , pumped decaying systems . in order to address questions about the generic behaviour of such systems ,",
    "it is important to understand how the variety of models used to describe polaritons relate , and what features each can explain .",
    "finally , let us mention that there remains an interesting topic which can be the subject of much future research : what new experiments are possible in these light - matter systems that were not possible in either lasers or in atomic gases .",

    "<S> semiconductor microcavities , in which strong coupling of excitons to confined photon modes leads to the formation of exciton - polariton modes , have increasingly become a focus for the study of spontaneous coherence , lasing , and condensation in solid state systems . </S>",
    "<S> this review discusses the significant experimental progress to date , the phenomena associated with coherence which have been observed , and also discusses in some detail the different theoretical models that have been used to study such systems . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both the case of non - resonant pumping , in which coherence may spontaneously arise , and the related topics of resonant pumping , and the optical parametric oscillator . </S>"
