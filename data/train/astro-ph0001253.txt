    "classical novae are sporadically injecting material processed by explosive hydrogen - burning nucleosynthesis into the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "both theoretical and observational evidence suggests that novae , although they have probably processed less than @xmath3 0.3% of the galactic matter , may be important producers of @xmath0li , @xmath1c , @xmath2n , @xmath4o , @xmath5na , and @xmath6al ( see gehrz _",
    "_ 1998 for a review ) .",
    "the role of novae in the enrichment of the ism has already been investigated by dantona & matteucci ( 1991 ) ( hereafter dm ) and matteucci & dantona ( 1991 ) . in dm @xmath0li production from novae",
    "is computed according to the results of starrfield _ et al . _",
    "( 1978 ) concerning the explosive nucleosynthesis in nova outbursts and those of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1982 ) concerning the nova secular evolution .",
    "the dm results suggest that novae should contribute to more than 50% to the global @xmath0li production , that @xmath1c and @xmath2n are produced proportionally to @xmath0li in novae , and that no primary @xmath1c should originate from low - intermediate mass stars in order to fit the observational constraints in the dm scenario .    here",
    "we reanalyse the influence of novae on the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood , by using the results recently obtained by jos & hernanz ( 1998 ) ( hereafter jh ) from a grid of hydrodynamical nova models .",
    "the adopted chemical evolution model is that of chiappini _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) . in this model",
    "the galaxy is formed by two distinct episodes of mass accretion : the first one builds the halo and thick - disk substructures ; the second one , almost independent from the former and temporally delayed with respect to it , originates the thin - disk , mainly through accretion of matter of primordial chemical composition .",
    "the explosive nucleosynthesis from nova outbursts is included in the model under quite straightforward assumptions on nova progenitors .",
    "we assume that at any given time @xmath7 the rate of nova outbursts is a fraction @xmath8 of the white dwarf ( wd ) formation rate at a previous time @xmath9 multiplyed by the number of outbursts per nova ( @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 we assume that all stars with initial mass between 0.8 and 8 @xmath12 end their life as wds .",
    "@xmath13 is the lifetime of a star of mass @xmath14 and @xmath15 = 1 gyr is the delay time required for the wd to cool and the first nova outburst to occur ( romano _ et al .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 , constant in time , is fixed from the condition of reproducing the currently observed rate of nova outbursts in the galaxy , namely @xmath16 @xmath3 30 @xmath17 30% yr@xmath18 ( della valle 2000 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 = 10@xmath19 is the total number of outbursts suffered by the average nova ( bath & shaviv 1978 ) .",
    "the stellar sources of @xmath0li considered are : carbon stars , massive agb stars , type ii supernovae ( sne ) and novae . for stars with initial masses in the range",
    "25 @xmath12 ( carbon stars ) and 58 @xmath12 ( massive agb stars ) we evaluate the masses ejected as newly produced @xmath0li following dm and matteucci _ et al . _",
    "in particular , in model a and model b we adopt the same prescriptions on @xmath0li as in the best model of matteucci _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) , whereas in model c we set to zero the contribution from carbon stars and assume a lower @xmath0li production from massive agb stars .    for stars with initial mass @xmath20 @xmath21 10 @xmath12 we use either the whole yields of @xmath0be + @xmath0li tabulated by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) ( model a and model b ) or the same yields but reduced by a factor of 2 ( model c ) .",
    "li production during thermonuclear runaways in novae is included in our model by averaging on 14 evolutionary sequences computed by jh , to which we refer for details about input physics , nucleosynthesis and related uncertainties .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 30% of nova systems",
    "accrete hydrogen rich matter onto the surface of onemg wds , whereas the remaining accrete hydrogen rich matter onto the surface of co wds . one model ( model a ) does not take into account novae as li producers .",
    "a further @xmath0li source is identified in the galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) spallation on ism nuclei .",
    "therefore , we run a model ( model c + gcrs ) in which we add the absolute @xmath0li yields from gcrs as given by lemoine _",
    "( 1998 ) ( their table 1 , case with lower - bound spectrum and @xmath22 = 1 ) .",
    "@xmath1c and @xmath2n produced during a nova outburst are primary products since they form from c and o seeds which were synthesized during the previous evolution of the wd progenitor , starting from h and he .",
    "however , due to the long time taken for novae to expell their synthesized products , the abundances of @xmath1c and @xmath2n produced by novae behave like secondary products ( wilson & matteucci 1992 , and refs . therein ) . as a consequence of this , when including this late contribution into the chemical evolution model , the @xmath23c/@xmath1c ratio in the solar neighborhood is expected to decrease from the time of the solar system formation up to now . in models 5 , 6 , and 7 , where the nova contribution is added by averaging on the results from 14 evolutionary sequences ( jh )",
    ", @xmath1c turns out to be always overproduced ( see table 2 ) .",
    "therefore , we need some _ ad hoc _ assumptions : the average @xmath1c production from a single nova system during the overall evolutionary history of the solar neighborhood should be not larger than the minimum one suggested by jh ( models 8 , 9 , 10 ) . a model intermediate between model 9 and model 10 should guarantee the best fit to all the observational constraints considered here ( see table 2 and fig.2 , panel _ c _ ) . unfortunately , the solar @xmath2n abundance turns out to be overestimated by all the models .",
    "therefore , we explain the decreasing @xmath23c/@xmath1c ratio in the local ism as due to the primary nature of @xmath23c coupled to the primary + secondary nature of @xmath1c ( see also prantzos _ et al .",
    "a recent work by palla _ et al . _ ( 1999 ) strongly supports the idea that the majority of the planetary nebula progenitors must have undergone an extra - mixing process , resulting in an enhanced @xmath1c abundance in the surface layers and leading to a @xmath23c/@xmath1c ratio lower than predicted by standard stellar evolutionary models .",
    "this @xmath1c source is equivalent to that from novae since in both cases this extra source is acting at late times . in summary",
    ": we can not conclude that novae are necessary to explain the @xmath23c/@xmath1c ratio , but we can conclude that the inclusion of nova nucleosynthesis in the chemical evolution model for our galaxy improves the predictions for both @xmath0li and @xmath1c evolution .",
