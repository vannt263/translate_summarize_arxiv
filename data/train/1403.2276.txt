    "the _ cassini _ spacecraft , in orbit around saturn since july 2004 , has allowed huge progress on modelling of the internal structure and the rotational dynamics of titan .",
    "an internal ocean is consistent with the measurements of the tidal love number @xmath6 @xcite and was theoretically predicted by @xcite , this prediction being supported by several following studies , e.g. @xcite .",
    "a comparison between the shape of titan @xcite ( tab.[tab : titanshape ] ) and its gravity field @xcite ( tab.[tab : titangravity ] ) suggests either variations in the thickness of a floating ice shell @xcite or lateral variations in the shell s density @xcite .",
    ".the shape of titan , from @xcite.[tab : titanshape ] [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      we also derived the mean obliquity of the core @xmath7 , from a frequency analysis of the resulting trajectories .",
    "it is close to @xmath8 arcmin , and the instantaneous core obliquity @xmath9 can vary between @xmath10 and @xmath11 arcmin over the next 100 years .",
    "we also checked that the period @xmath12 of the free oscillations is slightly bigger than suggested by the analytical formula ( [ eq : sigma3 ] ) , the error being smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "the goal of this study was to investigate the constraint that the rotation of titan could provide on its interior . supporting the suggestion originally by @xcite",
    ", we find that between 10 and 13@xmath14 of our realistic titans fall into a resonance with the annual forcing , raising the obliquity of the shell .",
    "these titans have a 130 to 140 km mean thickness shell overlying a @xmath5250 thick ocean , and include shell thickness variations ( bottom loading ) that are from @xmath15 to @xmath16 compensated , consistent with the gravity and topography constraints",
    ". a better determination of the gravity field would help to refine these numbers .",
    "the quasi - resonant behavior results in two solutions to explain the observed obliquity of titan , that could be discriminated by measuring the time derivative of the obliquity .",
    "a detection by _ cassini _ of a time - variable obliquity would thus provide strong evidence for the analysis presented here .",
    "benot noyelles is an f.r.s.- fnrs postdoctoral research fellow .",
    "fn acknowledges support from the cassini participating scientist program .",
    "we here aim at deriving the gravitational torque of the shell on the crust as @xcite did .",
    "we first express the vector @xmath17 pointing to the position of a mass element of the core , in the reference frames of the shell and of the core :    @xmath18    with    @xmath19    and    @xmath20    @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the cartesian coordinates of the mass element expressed in the two reference frames , of the shell and of the core respectively .    from    @xmath23",
    "we get    @xmath24    after expression of the potential @xmath25 in the reference frame of the core following eq.([eq : l1n3 ] ) , derivation to get the gradient and the cross product , and elimination of the crossed terms resulting in a null integral because the core is triaxial , we get from the eq.([eq : torquesx ] ) :    @xmath26 \\nonumber \\\\      & + & 6\\gamma\\left[\\begin{array}{c }      ( m_2m_3-l_2l_3)\\iiint_{core}\\rho_c\\left(z^2-y^2\\right)dxdydz \\vv{f_1^c } \\\\      ( l_1l_3-m_1m_3)\\iiint_{core}\\rho_c\\left(z^2-x^2\\right)dxdydz \\vv{f_2^c } \\\\      ( m_1m_2-l_1l_2)\\iiint_{core}\\rho_c\\left(y^2-x^2\\right)dxdydz \\vv{f_3^c } \\end{array}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the matrix of the transformation from @xmath27 to @xmath28 is orthogonal as a product of orthogonal matrices , we have    @xmath29    and from    @xmath30    we finally obtain    @xmath31 + 6\\gamma\\left[\\begin{array}{c }      ( l_2l_3-m_2m_3)(c^c - b^c ) \\vv{f_1^c } \\\\      -(l_1l_3-m_1m_3)(c^c - a^c ) \\vv{f_2^c } \\\\      ( l_1l_2-m_1m_2)(b^c - a^c ) \\vv{f_3^c } \\end{array}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this formula being consistent with the eq.7 of @xcite .",
    "the frequency analysis algorithm that we use is based on laskar s original idea , named naff as numerical analysis of the fundamental frequencies ( see for instance @xcite for the method , and @xcite for the convergence proofs ) .",
    "it aims at identifying the coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 of a complex signal @xmath34 obtained numerically over a finite time span @xmath35 $ ] and verifying    @xmath36    where @xmath33 are real frequencies and @xmath32 complex coefficients .",
    "if the signal @xmath34 is real , its frequency spectrum is symmetric and the complex amplitudes associated with the frequencies @xmath33 and @xmath37 are complex conjugates .",
    "the frequencies and amplitudes associated are found with an iterative scheme . to determine the first frequency @xmath38 , one searches for the maximum of the amplitude of    @xmath39    where the scalar product @xmath40 is defined by    @xmath41    @xmath42 being the complex conjugate of @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is a weight function alike a hann or a hamming window , i.e. a positive function verifying    @xmath45    using such a window can help the determination in reducing the amplitude of secondary minima in the transform ( [ equ : prodscal ] ) .",
    "its use is optional .",
    "once the first periodic term @xmath46 is found , its complex amplitude @xmath47 is obtained by orthogonal projection , and the process is started again on the remainder @xmath48 .",
    "the algorithm stops when two detected frequencies are too close to each other , what alters their determinations , or when the number of detected terms reaches a limit set by the user .",
    "this algorithm is very efficient , except when two frequencies are too close to each other . in that case , the algorithm is not confident in its accuracy and stops .",
    "when the difference between two frequencies is larger than twice the frequency associated with the length of the total time interval , the determination of each fundamental frequency is not perturbed by the other ones .",
    "although the iterative method suggested by @xcite allows to reduce this distance , some troubles may remain . in our specific case , the titans affected by the annual resonance present a frequency of free oscillations that is very close to the forcing frequency of the sun , the period associated being 29.46 years . for these titans , distinguishing these two oscillations is challenging .",
    "this calculation is not original and can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "we here write it in a way pretty similar as in @xcite .",
    "our physical model is different because we do not consider elastic effects .",
    "since we are here only interested in the longitudinal librations , we can a priori assume that the obliquities and polar motions of the core and the shell are negligible .",
    "this yields @xmath49 and @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "so , only the eq .",
    "[ eq : dotpc ] , [ eq : dotomega3c ] , [ eq : dotps ] and [ eq : dotomega3s ] still hold .",
    "after expansion of the orbital ephemerides up to the first order in eccentricity @xmath52 and expression of the resonant arguments @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we get :    @xmath55    with    @xmath56    @xmath57 being the mean anomaly of titan . the amplitudes of the forced librations at orbital period @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be written as    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the frequencies of the free longitudinal oscillations :    @xmath63",
