    "my lectures at the first stckleberg symposium began with an introduction to the challenges of quantum gravity , then discussed key features of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) and finally summarized applications to cosmology .",
    "however , in view of the page limit , in these proceedings i decided to present the material from a different perspective , through the lens of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) .",
    "thus , rather than starting with general considerations and then descending to applications , here i will follow an opposite approach , using applications to illustrate some of the key problems of quantum gravity and distinguishing features of lqg .",
    "the advantage of this reverse strategy is that students and other beginning researchers can appreciate the key issues , challenges and advances in a rather simple setting , without having to first grasp the technical intricacies of full lqg .",
    "the main drawback is that this approach leaves out some of the most interesting developments such as statistical mechanical calculations of black hole entropy , discussions of the issue of information loss , and spin foams , particularly the recent advances in calculating graviton propagators in the non - perturbative setting of lqg @xcite .    with these caveats in mind ,",
    "let us begin with a list of some of the long standing conceptual and technical issues of quantum gravity on which loop quantum cosmology has a bearing .    in general relativity",
    ", gravity is encoded in the very geometry of space - time .",
    "the most dramatic features of general relativity can be traced back to this dual role of geometry : the expansion of the universe , the big - bang , formation of black holes and emergence of gravitational waves as ripples of space - time curvature . already in the classical theory",
    ", it took physicists several decades to truly appreciate the dynamical nature of geometry and to get used to the absence of a kinematic background geometry . in quantum gravity",
    ", this paradigm shift leads to a new level of conceptual and technical difficulties .    *",
    "the absence of a background geometry implies that classical dynamics is generated by constraint equations . in the quantum theory ,",
    "physical states are solutions to quantum constraints .",
    "all of physics , including the dynamical content of the theory , has to be extracted from these solutions .",
    "but there is no external time to phrase questions about evolution .",
    "therefore we are led to ask : can we extract , from the arguments of the wave function , one variable which can serve as _ emergent time _ with respect to which the other arguments ` evolve ' ?",
    "if not , how does one interpret the framework ?",
    "what are the physical ( i.e. , dirac ) observables ? in a pioneering work , dewitt proposed that the determinant of the 3-metric can be used as an ` internal ' time @xcite .",
    "consequently , in much of the literature on the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) approach to quantum cosmology , the scale factor is assumed to play the role of time , although often only implicitly .",
    "however , in closed models the scale factor fails to be monotonic due to classical recollapse and can not serve as a global time variable already in the classical theory .",
    "are there better alternatives at least in the simple setting of quantum cosmology ? if not , can we still make physical predictions ?",
    "* can one construct a framework that cures the short - distance difficulties faced by the classical theory near singularities , while maintaining an agreement with it at large scales ? by their very construction , perturbative and effective descriptions have no problem with the second requirement .",
    "however , physically their implications can not be trusted at the planck scale and mathematically they generally fail to provide a deterministic evolution across the putative singularity . in lqg",
    "the situation is just the opposite .",
    "quantum geometry gives rise to new discrete structures at the planck scale that modify the classical theory in such a way that , at least in simple models , space - like singularities of general relativity are resolved .",
    "however , since the emphasis is on background independence and non - perturbative methods , a priori it is not clear whether the theory also has a rich semi - classical sector . do the novel dynamical corrections unleashed by the underlying quantum geometry naturally fade away at macroscopic distances or do they have unforeseen implications that prevent the theory from reproducing general relativity at large scales ? some of such unforeseen problems are discussed in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "next , the dual role of the space - time metric also implies that space - time itself ends when the gravitational field becomes infinite .",
    "this is in striking contrast with minkowskian physics , where singularity of one specific field has no bearing at all on the space - time structure or on the rest of physics . in general relativity singularities of the gravitational field",
    "represent an _ absolute boundary _ of space - time where _ all of physics",
    "_ comes to a halt .",
    "now , it is widely believed that the prediction of a singularity such as the big - bang in classical general relativity is primarily a signal that the theory has been pushed beyond the domain of its validity and can not therefore be trusted .",
    "one needs a quantum theory of gravity to analyze true physics .",
    "this expectation immediately leads to a host of questions which have been with us for several decades now : +    * how close to the big - bang does a smooth space - time of gr make sense ?",
    "inflationary scenarios , for example , are based on a space - time continuum .",
    "can one show from some first principles that this is a safe approximation already at the onset of inflation ?",
    "* is the big - bang singularity naturally resolved by quantum gravity ?",
    "this possibility led to the development of the field of quantum cosmology in the late 1960s .",
    "the basic idea can be illustrated using an analogy to the theory of the hydrogen atom . in classical electrodynamics",
    "the ground state energy of this system is unbounded below .",
    "furthermore , because an accelerating electron radiates continuously , it must fall into the proton making the atom extremely unstable .",
    "quantum physics intervenes and , thanks to a non - zero planck s constant , the ground state energy is lifted to a finite value , @xmath0 .",
    "the hope was that a similar mechanism would resolve the big - bang and big crunch singularities in simple cosmological models .",
    "however , as we will see in some detail in section [ s2 ] , the quantization did not realize this hope .",
    "can the quantum nature of geometry underlying lqg make a fundamental difference to this status - quo ? * is a new principle/ boundary condition at the big bang or the big crunch essential to provide a deterministic evolution ?",
    "the most well known example of such a boundary condition is the ` no boundary proposal ' of hartle and hawking @xcite . or ,",
    "do quantum einstein equations suffice by themselves even at the classical singularities ? * do quantum dynamical equations remain well - behaved even at these singularities ?",
    "if so , do they continue to provide a deterministic evolution ?",
    "the idea that there was a pre - big - bang branch to our universe has been advocated by several approaches , most notably by the pre - big - bang scenario in string theory @xcite and ekpyrotic and cyclic models inspired by brane world ideas @xcite .",
    "however , in such perturbative treatments there is always a smooth continuum in the background and hence the dynamical equations break down at the singularity . consequently , the pre - big - bang branch is not joined to the current post - big - bang branch by a deterministic evolution .",
    "the hope has been that non - perturbative effects would remedy this situation in the future .",
    "lqg , on the other hand , does not have a continuum geometry in the background and the treatment is non - perturbative .",
    "so , one is led to ask : can the lqc quantum einstein s equation provide a deterministic evolution across the big bang and the big - crunch ? * if there is a deterministic evolution , what is on the ` other side ' ?",
    "is there just a quantum foam from which the current post - big - bang - branch is born , say a ` planck time after the putative big - bang '",
    "? or , was there another classical universe as in the pre - big - bang and cyclic scenarios , joined to ours by deterministic equations ?",
    "_ the goal of this article is show that such questions can be answered satisfactorily in the simplest lqc models_. the first significant results appeared already five years ago in the pioneering work of bojowald @xcite .",
    "since then there has been a steady stream of papers by a dozen or so researchers and the field achieved a new degree of maturity over the last year .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ s4 ] this is not the end of the story because in lqc one first symmetry reduces the classical theory and then quantizes it .",
    "nonetheless , since the quantization procedure mimics that of full lqg , the lqc answers provide not only the much needed intuition but also a strategy for answering the larger questions .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s2 ] introduces the reader to quantum cosmology and reviews the theory .",
    "while one can answer some of the questions posed above , the theory fails to resolve the big bang and the big crunch singularities .",
    "the situation is drastically different in lqc where not only are the singularities resolved but most of the questions have physically desired answers .",
    "the key ideas and the structure of lqc are summarized in section [ s3 ] , which also explains the sense in which it ` descends ' form full lqg and emphasizes the main differences between lqc the theory . for definiteness",
    ", i will use the k=1 frw models coupled to a massless scalar field @xcite to illustrate in some detail both the difficulties discussed above and the way they can be handled . for results on the k=0 model , see @xcite , for a first discussion of the k=1 and of the anisotropic models , see @xcite and for a detailed review of the developments in lqc till 2005 , see @xcite .",
    "i conclude in section [ s4 ] with a brief summary of these other developments and a discussion of the many challenges that still remain .",
    "both on the mathematical and phenomenological fronts , most of the work to date in classical cosmology involves spatially homogeneous models and perturbations thereof . in the late 60 s",
    "dewitt @xcite and misner @xcite began investigations in _ quantum _ cosmology with a similar viewpoint : first reduce general relativity by imposing homogeneity and then quantize the resulting system . since this system has only a finite number of degrees of freedom ,",
    "the key field - theoretic difficulties are bypassed . however , since there is no classical space - time in the background , most of the conceptual problems of full quantum gravity still remain .",
    "therefore one can hope that resolution of these problems in this technically simpler context would provide valuable insights for the full theory .",
    "in particular , as mentioned above , an initial expectation was that quantum effects particularly the uncertainty principle would intervene and resolve the big bang and the big crunch singularities .",
    "while subsequent work in the seventies and eighties did shed light on several conceptual issues , this specific expectation was not met .",
    "i will begin by briefly explaining the strategy used in these analyses and point out its limitation .",
    "this summary will also serve to bring out the new elements of lqc .    in this early work , the configuration space consisted of positive definite 3-metrics . in the simplest , spatially homogeneous , isotropic context , this metric",
    "is completely determined by the scale factor @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath1 is restricted to be positive , one generally introduced a new variable @xmath2 and , as in quantum mechanics , considered wave functions @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes possible matter fields . as in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the basic operators were defined via @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "quantization of the classical hamiltonian constraint , p_^2 + e^ = h _ , where @xmath7 is the matter hamiltonian , then led to a differential equation , called the equation .",
    "if the matter field is a zero rest mass scalar field the case i will focus on for simplicity the equation becomes [ wdwhc ] ^2 _ - e^4 = ^2_(for details , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "physical quantum states are solutions to this equation . to extract physics",
    ", one has to introduce an inner product and suitable observables on the space of these states .",
    "the task of finding these observables is not entirely straightforward because they must _ preserve the space of solutions to ( [ wdwhc ] ) _ , i.e. , they must be dirac observables . using these observables , one can then ask if classical singularities are resolved in quantum theory .",
    "the older literature does not appear to analyze this issue in any detail since its focus was on the wkb approximation which , unfortunately , becomes unreliable near the singularity .",
    "however , they were analyzed in some detail recently ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "i will now provide a summary of the main results .",
    "@xmath8@xmath9   classical solutions .",
    "since @xmath10 is a constant of motion , a classical trajectory can be plotted in the @xmath11-@xmath4 plane , where @xmath11 is essentially the volume in planck units ( see eq ( [ v ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath9 expectation values ( and dispersions ) of @xmath12 for the wdw wave function and comparison with the classical trajectory .",
    "the wave function follows the classical trajectory into the big - bang and big - crunch singularities .",
    "( in this simulation , the parameters were : @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . ) , title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]   classical solutions .",

    "the wave function follows the classical trajectory into the big - bang and big - crunch singularities .",
    "( in this simulation , the parameters were : @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . ) , title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]    each classical trajectory begins with the big bang , undergoes a subsequent expansion and a recollapse and finally contracts into the big crunch singularity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wdw1 ] a ) .",
    "since there is no potential , the matter momentum @xmath10 is a constant of motion .",
    "consequently , @xmath4 is a monotonic function on each classical trajectory .",
    "therefore , it can be thought of as ` internal time ' in the classical theory .",
    "the form of the equation ( [ wdwhc ] ) suggests that the same is true in quantum theory .",
    "thus the equation can be regarded as an ` evolution equation ' with respect to this _ emergent time _ , @xmath4 .",
    "next , @xmath15 is a dirac observable in the quantum theory .",
    "given any value @xmath16 of @xmath4 , one can also define a second dirac observable , @xmath17 , corresponding to the volume of the universe at any given ` time ' @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the pair @xmath18 constitutes a complete set of dirac observables .",
    "finally , the requirement that these observables be self - adjoint fixes the physical inner product ( which can also be determined by the more precise group averaging technique @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the first set of questions raised in section [ s1 ] can be answered satisfactorily in the theory .    now to answer the remaining questions about singularity , one can proceed as follows .",
    "consider a point @xmath19 on a classical trajectory with @xmath20 , where the universe is large and the curvature is low compared to the planck scale . at ` time ' @xmath21 , one can construct an initial _ quantum _ state which is peaked at values @xmath22 of the dirac observables @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "one can then evolve it using the equation . of ( [ wdwhc ] ) , where the positive definite self - adjoint operator @xmath25 is the negative of the operator on the right side of ( [ wdwhc ] ) .",
    "one uses this ` first order in time ' equation to ` evolve ' the wave function . for details , see @xcite . ]",
    "the solutions can be expressed in terms of modified bessel functions . a resulting plot of the expectation values and dispersions of @xmath26 as a function of @xmath4",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wdw1 ] b. the good news is that , when the universe is large , the quantum state remains sharply peaked at the classical trajectory , showing that the theory has a good semi - classical limit .",
    "the bad news is that the quantum state continues to be peaked at this trajectory even as the classical trajectory hits the big bang and the big crunch singularities !",
    "thus , although the theory is background independent and non - perturbative , its results are similar to that of background dependent , perturbative treatments : good semi - classical limit but no improvement on the classical short distance pathologies .",
    "* remark : * in the classical solution , the scalar field @xmath4 tends to @xmath27 at the big bang and to @xmath28 at the big crunch .",
    "therefore , the evolution is unitary on the entire real line of the ` emergent time ' .",
    "as we just saw , even semi - classical states simply track the classical solution and therefore to the extent classical solutions are singular singularities are reached in finite _",
    "proper time_ so are the quantum solutions .",
    "thus , while the emergent time @xmath4 is useful in enabling us to think of ` evolution ' , unitary evolution over its entire range does not guarantee non - singular behavior .",
    "additional considerations , such as the relation between the emergent time and proper time in semi - classical settings are essential .",
    "since readers may not be familiar with the hamiltonian description used in lqc , i will summarize its key elements before proceeding with quantization .    let us consider space - time manifolds which have the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 has the topology of a 3-sphere , @xmath31 . as misner showed in the late 60 s @xcite",
    ", one can identify @xmath30 with the symmetry group @xmath32 ( which ensures spatial homogeneity and isotropy ) and endow it with a fixed fiducial basis of 1-forms @xmath33 and vectors @xmath34 .",

    "homogeneous setting , these canonically conjugate fields are parameterized by constants @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively : [ ps ] a_a^i = c ^-1 _ a^i , e^a_i = p ^-2 ^a_i which are functions of time .",

    "more precisely , at the point @xmath49 of the phase space , the physical 3-metric @xmath50 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath51 are given by : q_ab = |p| ^-2 _ abk_ab = ( c- ) |p|^ ^-2 _ ab the corresponding physical volume of @xmath30 is @xmath52 .",
    "the scale factor @xmath53 associated with a physical metric @xmath50 is generally expressed via @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the _ unit _ 3-sphere metric .",

    "this strategy was natural because one did not have access to full quantum geometrodynamics to take guidance from .",

    "after all the system has only a finite number of degrees of freedom and von neumann s theorem assures us that , under appropriate assumptions , the resulting quantum mechanics is unique .",
    "the only remaining freedom appears to be in the factor - ordering of the hamiltonian constraint and this is generally insufficient to lead to qualitatively different predictions .",
    "it turns out however that if one mimics full lqg , one naturally violates a key assumption of von neumann s uniqueness theorem and , in spite of the presence of only a finite number of degrees of freedom , one is led to _",
    "new quantum mechanics_.    to explain this point , let me begin with a quick summary of the relevant structure of full lqg .",
    "since novel elements of interest to us appear in the gravitational sector , in the remainder of this subsection i will ignore matter . to maintain gauge covariance ,",
    "configuration variables are taken to be the ` wilson lines ' or the holonomies @xmath61 along arbitrary edges @xmath62 , determined by the @xmath32 connection @xmath41 . geometrically ,",

    "our job is to find a representation of this ` holonomy - flux ' algebra which preserves background independence of the theory .",
    "the surprising result is that the representation is unique @xcite !",
    "more precisely , the algebra admits a unique ( internal , i.e. @xmath32 gauge and ) diffeomorphism invariant state and the representation is generated by the action of the algebra on this state .-",

    "a state @xmath69 is a positive linear functional on the algebra , i.e. a linear functional which satisfies @xmath70 for all @xmath71 .",

    "] thus , one way to understand the difference between the schrdinger and the new quantum mechanics is to realize that while in the schrdinger theory the ` quantum configuration space ' continues to be the classical configuration space , @xmath102 , in the new theory it is replaced by a certain completion @xmath110 thereof . the same phenomenon occurs in full lqg : while the classical configuration space @xmath111 is the space of smooth @xmath32 connections on a 3-manifold @xmath112 , the quantum configuration space @xmath113 is a certain completion thereof , containing also ` generalized connections ' which can be arbitrarily discontinuous .",
    "the haar measure on @xmath32 induces a natural , faithful , regular borel measure @xmath114 on @xmath113 .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space of lqg is @xmath115 .",
    "thus the completion @xmath110 of lqc is replaced by @xmath113 and the measure @xmath116 by the measure @xmath117 .",
    "technically both completions @xmath113 and @xmath103 arise as the ` gelfand spectrum ' of the holonomy algebras in the two theories .",
    "next , let us consider the algebraic approach .",
    "the @xmath72-algebra generated by @xmath118 is the lqc analog of the holonomy flux algebra of full lqg .",
    "the analog of the unique lqg diffeomorphism state on this @xmath72-algebra is the positive - linear functional @xmath69 which has the following action on the basic operators : @xmath119 and @xmath120 . as in full lqg ,",
    "the gelfand , naimark , segal construction then leads us to the kinematical hilbert space @xmath88 . in this space , the abstract state is represented by the concrete vector @xmath121 , or equivalently @xmath122 , in which the triad vanishes and , heuristically",

    "the full hilbert space is generated by a repeated action of the algebra on this state .",
    "a natural basis in the lqg kinematical hilbert space is given by the so - called spin network functions .",
    "these are analogous to the states @xmath123 in the connection representation of lqc . just as @xmath123 diagonalize operators @xmath124 , ( appropriately chosen ) spin networks diagonalize triads and hence geometric operators .",
    "this is why a firm grasp of the lqc quantum kinematics can provide good intuition for full lqg .    finally , a word of caution : the analogy does fail in a few but important respects because of the homogeneity assumption of lqc .",
    "so , it should be pursued as a guideline to aid intuition rather than a literal dictionary .      to describe quantum dynamics",
    ", we have to first introduce a well - defined operator on @xmath88 representing the hamiltonian constraint @xmath125 .",
    "since there is no operator corresponding to @xmath44 itself , we can not directly use the final expression ( [ ham3 ] ) .",
    "rather , we return to the form ( [ ham2 ] ) from full general relativity and promote it to an operator .",
    "this procedure also serves to bring lqc closer to lqg .",
    "the general strategy is the same as in ordinary quantum mechanics : one first expresses various terms in ( [ ham2 ] ) in terms of ` elementary variables ' , namely the holonomies @xmath126 and momenta @xmath45 which have direct quantum analogs and then replaces them with operators @xmath127 and @xmath83 .",
    "quantization of the first term , @xmath128 , can then be carried out by directly following a procedure given by thiemann in the full theory @xcite .",
    "the second term is the field strength @xmath129 .",
    "as in gauge theories , one can obtain @xmath130 by first calculating the holonomy around a closed loop in the a - b plane , multiplying it by @xmath131 , dividing by the area and taking the limit as the area shrinks to zero .",
    "however , precisely because there is no connection operator @xmath132 in lqg , the limit can not exist in quantum theory . and @xmath45 .",
    "] however , the same feature that prevents @xmath133 from existing leads to quantum riemannian geometry in lqg and in particular implies that there is a smallest non - zero eigenvalue , @xmath134 , of the area operator .",
    "therefore the non - existence of the limit is interpreted as telling us that the procedure of shrinking the area of the loop to zero is inappropriate in quantum theory .",
    "rather , we should shrink the loop till its area equals @xmath134 .",
    "now , given a point @xmath49 of the classical phase space , a ` square ' loop each of whose sides has length @xmath135 with respect to the fiducial metric @xmath35 has area @xmath136 with respect to the _ physical _ metric @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , to define @xmath138 , the holonomy is evaluated around a ` square ' loop whose edges are formed by the integral curves of right and left invariant vector fields on @xmath31 , with @xmath139 given by ^2 |p| = 2 ^2 , so that _ physical _ area of the surface enclosed by the loop is @xmath134 .",

    "it was clear from the beginning that something like this must occur because there is no connection operator in lqg .",
    "recall that passage to quantum theory from the classical one _ always _ requires new physical inputs .",
    "quantization of @xmath130 is well motivated in the representation of the holonomy - flux algebra we are forced to use by the requirement of back ground independence .",
    "furthermore , one can show that @xmath140 does reduce , in a precise sense , to the standard local expression of curvature @xmath129 in the classical limit .",
    "( for details , see @xcite . )",
    "hence @xmath140 is a well - defined quantization of @xmath129 .",
    "however , the non - locality makes a crucial difference in the planck regime .",
    "in particular , as we will now see , it makes the gravitational part @xmath141 of the constraint a _ difference _ operator , rather than a differential operator as in the wheeler - dewitt theory .",
    "as one might expect , the ` step size ' is governed by the area gap @xmath134 .    using ( [ fop ] ) and the the operator corresponding to @xmath128 given by the thiemann procedure it is straightforward to construct the gravitational part @xmath141 of the constraint operator corresponding to ( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "it turns out @xcite that its expression is simplest if one considers wave functions which are naturally diagonal in the volume operator @xmath142 rather than in @xmath83 .",
    "( mathematically , this is a rather trivial transformation since @xmath143 . )",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the eigenvalues of the volume operator by @xmath11 such that : [ v ] @xmath144 = ( ) ^ ^3 @xmath144",

    "if we mimic full lqg , we are naturally led to a theory that is inequivalent to the theory even at the kinematical level .",
    "indeed the two hilbert spaces have no non - zero element in common .",
    "a key distinguishing feature of this theory is that while the holonomies of the connection are well defined operators , connections themselves are not .",
    "consequently , in the definition of the quantum hamiltonian constraint ( [ ham2 ] ) , we are led to define the field strength through holonomies along loops which enclose area @xmath134 , the smallest non - zero eigenvalue of the area operator . the gravitational part of the resulting hamiltonian constraint is a _ difference _ operator , rather than a differential operator that would have resulted had we worked in a schrdinger type representation used in the theory .",
    "however , in a well - defined sense it reduces to the differential operator for large @xmath11 @xcite .      as in the theory",
    ", we will now assume that the only matter field is a massless scalar field ( although it is straightforward to allow additional matter fields ) .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian constraint is such that this field can serve as an internal clock also in lqc and we can again use relational dynamics .",
    "this simplifies the intermediate technical steps and makes the physical meaning of results more intuitive .    to write the complete hamiltonian constraint we also need the matter part .",
    "for the massless scalar field , in the classical theory it is given by : c_matt = 8 g |p|^- p_^2 the non - trivial part in the passage to quantum theory is the function @xmath147 .",

    "this operator is self - adjoint on @xmath88 and diagonal in the eigenstates of the volume operator .",
    "we can express the total constraint [ hc1 ] ( v ) = ( _ grav + _ matt ) ( v ) = 0 , as follows : [ hc3 ] ^2_(v , ) = & - & ( v , ) + = & - & _ o ( v , ) + [ b(v)]^-1 ( v , ) .here , @xmath148 is a difference operator , [ hc4 ] _ o ( v , ) = - [ b(v)]^-1 ( c^+(v ) ( v+4 , ) + c^o(v ) ( v , ) + c^-(v ) ( v-4 , ) ) , where the coefficients @xmath149 and @xmath150 are given by : [ c ] c^+(v ) & = & |v + 2| | |v + 1| - |v + 3| | + c^-(v ) & = & c^+(v - 4 ) + c^o(v ) & = & - c^+(v ) - c^-(v )  . for the k=0 ( i.e. , flat ) frw model the quantum constraint",

    "these effects are small but dominate the planck scale physics by creating an effective repulsive force which can overwhelm gravitational attraction . while these effects are small outside the planck regime , in principle , they could have accumulated and led to departures from general relativity even in weak field regime on the very long time scales that are relevant to cosmology .",
    "_ this does not happen .",
    "_ while they dominate the planck regime , the quantum geometry effects die extremely quickly outside this regime so that in the weak field regime lqc is in excellent agreement with general relativity even on the very large cosmological time scales .",
    "in the last two section , i focused on a simple model to illustrate how one might hope to solve the long standing problems of quantum gravity using lqg .",
    "as i mentioned in the beginning of section [ s2 ] , several other cosmological models have been analyzed .",
    "roughly , work to date can be divided into three categories .",
    "* in the isotropic models with free scalar fields , with and without cosmological constant , there are detailed analytical as well as numerical frameworks to answer all questions of physical interest . in these models , there is only one non - trivial curvature invariant the scalar curvature @xmath209 and in the classical theory it is related very simply to energy density .",
    "therefore the onset of the quantum epoch which signals departures from classical general relativity can be described by critical values of either the scalar curvature or the density @xcite .",
    "* for the kasner model with anisotropies as well as models with physically interesting potentials for scalar fields , the physical sector of the theory can be constructed along the same lines . however , the analysis of effective equations is still somewhat incomplete and numerical analysis is still in infancy . in the anisotropic models",
    "the key features of the isotropic models resolution of singularities and emergence of semi - classical pre - big - bang branches persist . but",
    "new phenomena also emerge . with massless scalar fields as sources ,",
    "the scalar curvature @xmath209 is again determined by the matter density but there are also other curvature invariants in particular because the weyl tensor is no longer zero . now the quantum epoch is reached when any one of these invariants reaches the planck regime , whence multiple bounces can occur @xcite .",
    "density is no longer the governing factor ; rather it is space - time curvature . in models with potentials ,",
    "the scalar field does not always serve as internal time globally .",
    "however , it is still possible to construct the physical hilbert space using group averaging @xcite and introduce relational observables .",
    "a global emergent time aids our intuition immensely but is not essential in the construction of the physical sector of the theory . * in more complicated models",
    "black hole interiors @xcite and the so called midi - superspaces @xcite which are symmetry reduced but have an",
    "_ infinite _ number of degrees of freedom the hamiltonian constraint has been written down .",
    "it does not break down near the putative singularities signalling that they are resolved .",
    "however , the physical sector of the theory is yet to be constructed and numerical analysis has not yet been undertaken .",
    "but there do not appear to be any unsurmountable difficulties for these investigations to reach maturity in the near future .",
    "these advances are encouraging because they deal with the long standing questions i discussed in section [ s1 ] .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to string theory , space - like singularities that are resolved are of direct physical interest . however , the major downside is that these advances are based on symmetry reduction and the precise relation between these models and the full theory is still to be spelled out .",
    "while significant efforts are being made on this key problem @xcite , i think we are still at a preliminary stage largely because we do not have a clear candidate for full lqg .",
    "what lessons do these cosmological investigations have for full lqg ?    by now , the kinematic structure of full lqg is well controlled .",
    "key open issues involve dynamical issues .",
    "work in this area has been primarily focused on mathematical problems in full generality . in the leading approaches ,",
    "one first solves the diffeomorphism constraint and then imposes the hamiltonian constraint on the resulting diffeomorphism invariant states .",
    "the non - trivial achievement is that there are well - defined candidates for constraint operators @xcite .",
    "furthermore advances related to thiemann and dittrich s ` master constraint ' program @xcite strongly indicate that , for each admissible choice of the master constraint , one would be able to construct the physical sector of the theory .",
    "however , there is still a great deal of freedom in the definition of the constraint operators and , more importantly , the issue of existence of a sufficiently rich semi - classical sector has remained largely open .",
    "more recently , via their ` algebraic quantum gravity program , ' giesel and thiemann @xcite have introduced new strategies to address both these issues . here , the diffeomorphism and the hamiltonian constraints can be treated on an equal footing and imposed simultaneously .",
    "this enables one to address the long standing problem of recovering the classical constraint algebra and it is in fact possible to recover it using suitably defined semi - classical states @xcite .",
    "thus there is ongoing progress .",
    "nonetheless , fresh insights are needed to address key _ physical _ problems such as the fate of classical singularities in full lqg and the detailed recovery of einstein dynamics in the classical limit .",
    "since lqc has provided concrete solutions to these problems in simple models , a useful strategy would be to work ` from bottom up ' to less and less symmetric models .",
    "for example , in the symmetry reduced systems , one inevitably carries out a gauge fixing which provides a good control on individual space - time geometries rather than equivalence classes of them under diffeomorphisms .",
    "similarly , the standard description of the low energy world involves specific space - time metrics .",
    "while one can translate both these descriptions in a manifestly diffeomorphism invariant language , the result would be quite cumbersome .",
    "the procedures used in models can complement the more general and more systematic programs that are being pursued in full lqg",
    ".    the idea would be to work one s way up by incorporating , at each step , lessons learned from the symmetry reduced models .",
    "these models suggest that , to address physically important issues , it may be essential to restrict oneself to interesting sectors of the theory finite , non - linear neighborhoods of the frw solutions , or of minkowski space - time , in the phase space of general relativity and exploit the additional structure such restrictions make available . secondly ,",
    "in lqc one could get truly valuable insights by analyzing in detail states which are semi - classical in a suitable sense .",
    "by contrast , the discussion of _ dynamics _ in the full theory generally focuses on ` elementary states ' the spin networks .",
    "these are analogous to the ` n - photon states ' of the maxwell theory , while the semi - classical states are analogous to the coherent states .",
    "both span the full hilbert space in the maxwell theory and are convenient in different regimes .",
    "genuinely new insights could be gained in interesting sectors of lqg if one revisits the issue of constructing and solving the hamiltonian constraint from a new perspective . as in mini and midi superspace analyses , one could exploit an astute gauge - fixing of ( a part of ) the diffeomorphism constraint , and the extra structure provided by a basis of semi - classical states .",
    "results of lqc appear to provide valuable guidelines not only for constructing the physical sector of the theory along these lines but also for answering some of the most challenging physical questions .",
    "i have benefited from valuable discussions with many colleagues i would like to thank especially martin bojowald , alex corichi , james hartle , gary horowitz , veronika hubney , jerzy lewandowski , donald marolf , tomasz pawlowski , parampreet singh , thomas thiemann , kevin vandersloot and participants in the first stckleberg workshop .",

    "<S> this introductory review is addressed to beginning researchers . some of the distinguishing features of loop quantum gravity are illustrated through loop quantum cosmology of frw models . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , these examples illustrate : i ) how ` emergent time ' can arise ; ii ) how the technical issue of solving the hamiltonian constraint and constructing the _ physical _ sector of the theory can be handled ; iii ) how questions central to the planck scale physics can be answered using such a framework ; and , iv ) how quantum geometry effects can dramatically change physics near singularities and yet naturally turn themselves off and reproduce classical general relativity when space - time curvature is significantly weaker than the planck scale . </S>"
