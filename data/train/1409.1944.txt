    "it is achieved by upregulating @xmath1 @xcite and downregulating @xmath5 @xcite via dna damage induced by @xmath6 causing growth arrest in cell cycle by giving time for dna repair @xcite .",

    "this molecular coupling can be done by constructing a larger system defined by @xmath158},x_2^{[1]},\\dots , x_6^{[1]},x_1^{[2]},x_2^{[2]},\\\\ \\dots , x_6^{[2]})^{-1}$ ] where the identical systems are its subsystems and then introducing two coupling reactions , @xmath159}\\stackrel{\\epsilon}\\longrightarrow x_5^{[2]}$ ] and @xmath160}\\stackrel{\\epsilon^\\prime}\\longrightarrow x_5^{[1]}$ ] .",
    "the system can be described by a set of 12 coupled differential equations with extra coupling terms @xmath161}-x_5^{[1]})$ ] and @xmath162}-x_5^{[2]})$ ] added to the differential equations with @xmath159}$ ] and @xmath160}$ ] respectively , where @xmath163 is taken .",
    "putting all the rate constant values in the coupled sub - systems to be the same , we solve the differential equations of the deterministic system numerically for various values of coupling constant , @xmath2 .",
    "the results for @xmath1 and @xmath5 for the coupled systems are shown in fig .",

    "the results show that there are three distinct states , namely , desynchronized ( the two systems are uncoupled and therefore @xmath164}$ ] fluctuates randomly ) , transition ( time to reach synchronized state from desynchronized state and @xmath164}$ ] weakly fluctuates ) and synchronized states ( @xmath164}$ ] become constant with small fluctuation about it ) .",
    "it is also seen that transition time decreases as @xmath2 increases which is evident both from time series data as well as from @xmath164}$ ] in fig . 5 .",
    "again we study the two coupled systems with various values of @xmath2 and calculated the approximate transition time @xmath165 .",
    "@xmath165 is the time taken to reach from transition to synchronized state after coupling is switched on . in the deterministic case",
    "we could get the synchronization faster as compared to the stochastic system .",
    "synchronization is achieved if the dynamics of the corresponding variables are same giving @xmath164}$ ] @xmath166 0 , which is easily seen in fig 5 panel 2nd and 6th.the behaviour of @xmath165 as a function of @xmath2 is shown in fig 6 . here",

    "the fig 6 shows that @xmath165 is an exponentially decaying function of @xmath2 which is given by @xmath167)=@xmath168 + b , where a and b are constants . here",
    "we can see that @xmath165 decreases as @xmath2 increases up to some critical value that is @xmath2 = 0.007 , after which @xmath165 remains constant .",
    "we then switch on the coupling at 0 hour and the deterministic results of the coupled systems are shown as recurrence plots in the planes ( @xmath169},x_1^{d[2]}$ ] ) and ( @xmath170},x_2^{d[2]}$ ] ) respectively for three different values of @xmath171 and @xmath172 respectively in the first two upper sets of panels in fig .",

    "[ ]        the same pattern of synchronization in @xmath1 and @xmath5 which we have found in deterministic case is obtained in the stochastic case also for the same @xmath2 and @xmath34 values .",
    "however , the rate of synchronization is much stronger in deterministic case as compared to stochastic case as the spreading of the points from diagonal in the respective planes in deterministic case is much thinner than same spreading of the points in stochastic case .",
    "this means that the role of the noise in coupled systems is to destruct the synchronization .",
    "we then present the stochastic results corresponding to the deterministic results with superscript s in fig .",

    "we get similar results as in the deterministic case except that @xmath176 and @xmath177 versus @xmath2 have larger fluctuations induced by noise and synchronization occur at larger @xmath2 values as compared to deterministic case as shown in right panels of fig .",
    "we then extended the range of @xmath2 to see the effect of excess @xmath6 diffusion in the coupled system .",

    "this leads us to claim that if the excess of @xmath6 is very strong , the toxic activity of @xmath6 could dominate over its synchronization activity and may lead to cell death .",
    "similar pattern is obtained in the case of @xmath5 .",
    "further it is to be noted that as the value of @xmath34 increases , the shifting of the system from desynchronized ( @xmath179 ) to transition state ( @xmath180 ) and then to strong synchronization state ( @xmath181 ) is achieved at smaller value of @xmath2 .",
    "however in the excess of @xmath6 regime ( @xmath182 and @xmath23 ) the toxic activity dominates the synchronization activity leading to decrease in the rate of synchronization as indicated by regime ( @xmath182 and @xmath23 ) of fig .",

    "if we increase @xmath34 further , transition from damped oscillation to sustain oscillation regime takes place that could be due to @xmath1 activation by @xmath6 is strongest .",
    "now if we again increase @xmath34 value , then @xmath184 starts decreasing which is given by transition from sustain to damped oscillation again .",
    "this shows the increase in toxicity in the cell due to excess of @xmath6 .",
    "if we increase @xmath34 further , @xmath184 is drastically decreased and become constant leading to transition from damped oscillation to fixed point oscillation behaviour .",

    "hence the nitric oxide is maintained at low , which is controlled by various sub - cellular networks .",
    "however , various stress conditions induced in the cell enhance the creation of nitric oxide and directly influence ( @xmath0 ) network via @xmath5 .",
    "this leads to the activation of @xmath1 molecule in the network which we get the evidence in our work . in the single cell model",
    ", the @xmath1 behaves as nearly normal keeping it low and stabilized when @xmath6 is low .",
    "if the @xmath6 is increased significantly , @xmath1 protein is activated indicated by its oscillatory behaviour .",
    "however excess @xmath6 prohibits the @xmath1 activation due to too much toxic induced and @xmath1 stabilized but at higher value as compared to normal cell .",
    "this may lead to cell apoptosis .",
    "another important property of @xmath6 is that it has been known as one of the most capable signaling molecules which can diffuse across the cell membrane .",
    "we consider this signaling molecule as synchronizing agent which can diffusively couple any two cells and study various behaviours in the coupled cells .",
    "the cells behave as uncoupled or non - interacting individuals if the coupling strength is small . however",
    "if the coupling strength is stronger then the cells start interacting each other by passing information via synchronizing molecule but may not strong enough to get complete synchronization ( transition regime ) .",
    "if the coupling strength is strong enough then the two cells get synchronized .",
    "it is also seen that synchronization is reached much faster in deterministic case than in stochastic system giving the destructive role of noise in achieving synchronization .",
    "since increase in coupling strength of @xmath6 means increase in @xmath6 diffusion in and out of the cell which in turn induce more toxic in the cell .",
    "this excess of @xmath6 diffusion leads to decrease in rate of synchronization even if coupling strength is increased .",
    "there are various issues to be solved in future for example information transmission and receiving among a large number of cells and spatio - temporal dependence of synchronization . since the @xmath1 protein is hugely connected hub , various influences of signaling molecules from various sub - networks need to be considered simultaneously .",

    "<S> we study these effects by using correlation like synchronization indicator @xmath3 obtained from permutation entropies of the coupled system , and found five important regimes in ( @xmath4 ) phase diagram , indicating desynchronized , transition , strongly synchronized , moderately synchronized and weakly synchronized regimes respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we claim that there is the competition between the toxicity and the synchronizing role of nitric oxide that lead the cell in different stressed conditions . </S>"
