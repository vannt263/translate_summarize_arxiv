    "in spite of the important achievements obtained in finance theory ( see for example http://welch.som.yale.edu/academics/toptenfinance.html and ch.35 in ref.@xcite ) nobody claims that the fundamental laws of the economic process are known .",
    "a set of fundamental laws under which all economic relations might be interpreted is certainly not known and , even if such laws were to exist , we do not know how to infer from the data what are the variables that play the relevant role in the equations .",
    "instead , economic theory generally establishes , a priori , the models as sets of restrictions in order to proceed to statistical tests of the data .",
    "most of the developments in finance theory follow this line .",
    "the dominant views , such as the efficient market hypothesis , based on the work of samuelson@xcite and fama@xcite , and the derived models , such as the multifactor capital asset pricing model ( capm ) @xcite and arbitrage pricing theory ( apt ) @xcite , assess the evolution of financial markets as the result of the rational action of informed agents faced with brownian processes .",
    "these models provide conceptual insights on the issues of pricing and portfolio selection , although attempts to test them has been hindered by the inability to find a reliable set of factors to explain the securities return data .",
    "chen et al . @xcite have attempted to establish statistical correlations between some economic facts ( like unanticipated changes in industrial production , interest rates or inflation ) and asset returns , to identify the _ economic forces _ that are driving the market .",
    "but the very identification of such forces , and the rationale for its theoretical underpinnings , is also controversial .",
    "mandelbrot , who studied the properties of stable distributions other than the gaussian , applied new statistical methods to financial series , suggested the existence of low frequency dependence in the stock market data and challenged the dominance of brownian processes@xcite .",
    "indeed , mandelbrot interpreted the fat tails in the distribution of changes of prices and the empirical evidence of sharp discontinuities in the evolution of these markets as evidence for the presence of a stable distribution . instead , his critics argued that the financial series should be interpreted as a result of variables with typically high frequency variance , such as serial correlation and markov dependence .",
    "consequently the fat tails of the distribution of price changes could be explained by subordinate stochastic processes , in particular by time varying variances of gaussian processes , rather than by stable distributions or truncated lvy processes .",
    "mandelbrot s views were understood as a criticism of the conventional wisdom on the inexistence of structure in the evolution of stock markets , and were generally rejected . also based on the market",
    ", we will address here this topic of debate from a different approach . instead of establishing correlations with predefined factors ,",
    "our point of view is that it may be possible to extract from the data itself , if not the economic variables , at least their geometrical relations . and also that such an exploration might be fruitful for statistical analysis . the idea is simply stated in the following terms :    \\(i ) pick a representative set of @xmath0 stocks and their historical data of returns over some time period .",
    "\\(ii ) from the returns data , using an appropriate metric , compute the matrix of distances between the @xmath0 stocks .",
    "the problem now is reduced to an embedding problem where , given a set of distances between points , one asks what is the smallest manifold that contains the set . given a graph g and an allowed distortion there are algorithmic techniques@xcite to map the graph vertices to a normed space in such a way that distances between the vertices of g match the distances between their geometric images , up to the allowed distortion",
    ". however , these techniques are not directly applicable to our problem because in the distances between assets , computed from their return fluctuations , there are systematic and unsystematic contributions .",
    "therefore , to extract factor information from the market , we have somehow to separate these two effects .",
    "the following stochastic geometry technique is used :    \\(iii ) from the matrix of distances , compute coordinates for the stocks in an euclidean space of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "( for a degenerate matrix the embedding dimension may be smaller )    \\(iv ) the stocks are now represented by a set @xmath2 of points in @xmath3 , to which we assign masses @xmath4 equal to their market capitalizations .",
    "\\(v ) to this cloud of weighted points we apply the standard analysis of reduction of their coordinates to the center of mass and computation of the eigenvectors of the inertial tensor .",
    "\\(vi ) the same technique is also applied to surrogate data , namely to data obtained by independent time permutation for each stock and to random data with the same mean and covariance .",
    "\\(vii ) the eigenvalues in ( v ) are compared with those of ( vi ) .",
    "the directions for which the eigenvalues are significantly different are now identified as the market systematic variables .    using weights ( masses ) proportional to",
    "the market capitalizations we are attempting to identify _  the empirically constructed variables _ that drive the market and the number of surviving eigenvalues is the _ effective dimension _ of this economic space .",
    "of course , what such a procedure reconstructs is the economic space associated to the set of stocks that is considered , not to the full market .",
    "even if a very large set of financial assets is used , there is no implied claim that financial markets fully reflect all what we would like to know about macroeconomics .",
    "all one is trying to do here is to reconstruct _ an _ economic space , not _ the _ economic space .",
    "the same technique may be used to infer factors for portfolio hedging purposes . in this case",
    "there is no reason to include weights and all companies may be considered to have the same weight .",
    "we will have examples of both types of calculation .",
    "in a recent paper gopikrishnan et al.@xcite used similar techniques , although with a different perspective . diagonalizing the correlation matrix ( which is related to the metric we use )",
    "they have tried to identify particular eigenvectors with the traditional industrial sectors . in our analysis",
    "the economic dimensions may or may not correspond to economic sectors or to other known economic factors or to any combination of them .",
    "it is up to the data to say what they are , independently of any previously established concepts .    in section 2",
    "the method is explained in detail and then , as an example , it is applied to market data of a set of large companies that are or have been in the dow jones industrial average and s&p500 indexes .",
    "from the returns @xmath5 for each security @xmath6 one defines a normalized vector @xmath7 @xmath8 being the number of components ( number of time labels ) in the vectors @xmath9 . with this vector one defines the _ distance _ between the securities @xmath10 and @xmath11 by the euclidean distance of the normalized vectors , @xmath12 @xmath13 being the correlation coefficient of the returns @xmath14 being an euclidean distance between two vectors , eq.([2.3 ] ) satisfies the usual distance axioms .",
    "it is the distance between market securities that was proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this distance is related to the covariances and much of what we discuss below could be carried out in a purely statistical setting .",
    "however the fact that @xmath15 is a properly defined distance gives a meaning to geometric notions and geometric tools in the study of the market .",
    "after the distances are computed , for the set of @xmath0 securities , they are imbedded in @xmath3 with coordinates @xmath16 .",
    "the center of mass @xmath17 is computed , @xmath18 the coordinates reduced to the center of mass , @xmath19 and the inertial tensor @xmath20 is diagonalized , the set of eigenvalues and normalized eigenvectors being @xmath21 .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath22 define the characteristic directions of the weighed set of securities and their @xmath23 coordinates along these directions are obtained by projection @xmath24    as stated before , the most relevant characteristic directions for our purposes are those that correspond to the eigenvalues which are clearly different from those obtained from surrogate or random data .",
    "they define a subspace @xmath25 of dimension @xmath26 .",
    "this @xmath27dimensional subspace carries the ( systematic ) information related to the market correlation structure .    in portfolio optimization models of the mean - variance type",
    ", one usually distinguishes between the systematic and unsystematic ( or specific ) contributions to the portfolio risk .",
    "the former are associated to the correlations between the assets in the portfolio and the latter to the individual variances alone . using our construction",
    "we find that part of the correlations contribution is indistinguishable from random data .",
    "hence the market ( systematic ) structure is carried by a smaller @xmath27dimensional subspace .",
    "this suggests the definition of a _ market dimension _ @xmath26 and a _ systematic covariance .",
    "_    denote by @xmath28 the restriction of the @xmath29asset to the subspace @xmath25 . and by @xmath30 the distances restricted to this space . then using eqs.([2.3 ] ) and ( [ 2.4 ] )",
    "we may define a notion of _ systematic covariance _",
    "@xmath31@xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    in a portfolio optimization problem",
    "@xmath36 the function to be minimized would be @xmath37 identical to the classical markowitz problem , but with the systematic covariance part restricted to the subspace @xmath25 .",
    "this analysis also provides a rationale for the choice of the number of terms in the construction of factor models , the factors being constructed from the leading characteristic dimensions ( see the example below ) .",
    "in addition to a detailed subspace analysis of the economic space , existence of a market metric provides network topology coefficients to characterize the whole space .",
    "one such notion is _ clustering _ , a meaningful well - known notion in graph theory . using the distance matrix @xmath38 ( eq.([2.3 ] ) ) to construct the minimal spanning tree connecting the @xmath0 securities , as in mantegna @xcite",
    ", we might then apply the graph theoretical notion of clustering to the spanning tree .",
    "however this construction neglects part of the information contained in the distance matrix .",
    "instead we introduce a notion of _ continuous clustering _ as follows :    @xmath38 being the distance between the securities @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath41 the average distance we define a function @xmath42 which represents the _ neighbor degree _ of the securities @xmath39 and @xmath40 . a ( continuous ) clustering coefficient",
    "is then defined by @xmath43",
    "we have considered the following 34 large companies which are , or have been , in the dow jones industrial average ( djia ) index :    alcoa ( aa ) , honeywell ( hon ) , american express ( axp ) , at&t ( t ) , boeing ( ba ) , caterpillar ( cat ) , chevron ( chv ) , coca - cola ( ko ) , dupont nemours ( dd ) , eastman kodak ( ek ) , exxon ( xon ) , general electric ( ge ) , goodyear ( gt ) , ibm ( ibm ) , international paper ( ip ) , mcdonalds ( mcd ) , merck ( mrk ) , minnesota mining ( mmm ) , general motors ( gm),philip morris ( mo ) , procter & gamble ( pg ) , sears ( s ) , texaco ( tx ) , united technologies ( utx ) , citigroup ( c ) , hewlett - packard ( hwp ) , home depot ( hd ) , intel ( intc ) , j. p. morgan chase ( jpm ) , johnson & johnson ( jnj ) , microsoft ( msft ) , sbc communications ( sbc ) , wal - mart ( wmt ) , walt disney ( dis ) .    they will be denoted by their tick symbols and we use daily data for the time period from september 1990 to august 2000 .    using the whole data for the ten years , to define the vectors",
    "@xmath44 for each company , the calculations described in section 2 have been performed for the actual returns data , for the time - permuted data and for random data with the same mean and variance as the actual data . in all cases",
    "we have performed the calculations with and without weights .",
    "the ordered eigenvalue distributions that were obtained are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the conclusion is that the ( systematic ) market structure is contained in the first five dimensions .",
    "that is , these dimensions capture the structure of the deterministic correlations and economic trends that are driving the market , whereas the remainder of the market space may be considered as being generated by random fluctuations . for this market , these five dimensions define our _ empirically constructed economic variables_.    to have a qualitative idea concerning the structure of the characteristic dimensions , we have plotted in figs . 2 and 3 the projections of the ( weighted ) stocks along the directions of the first eight eigenvectors . in the x - axis",
    "the companies are ordered according to their standard industrial code .",
    "although some companies in the same sector ( for example the oil companies ) have similar projections in the dominant eigenvalues , this is not at all true for all sectors , nor all companies .",
    "the association of companies working on different products in the same one or two - dimensional subspace is a confirmation of the fact that the search for the factors that drive the market can not be identified with a definition of economic sectors .",
    "notice that to be in the same market subspace , does not mean to be close to each other and some interesting anticorrelation effects are clear in fig.2 and 3 .",
    "this may be important to develop portfolio hedging strategies .    to test the stability of the economic structure inferred from the market",
    ", we have divided the data in three chronologically successive batches and performed the same operations .",
    "the behavior of the eigenvalue distributions is very much the same . in fig .",
    "4 we have plotted the three dimensional subspaces associated to the three largest eigenvalues . apart from statistical fluctuations , the reconstructed spaces show a reasonable degree of stability . however ,",
    "similarity of the figures is only apparent with a permutation of the axis between the first and the second plot .",
    "the ordering of the largest eigenvalues changes in time although the overall distribution remains approximately the same .",
    "these ordering change may have an economic meaning and be related to the relative importance and stability of groups of companies in different periods of expansion or recession .",
    "what is interesting , however , is the relative stability of the company positions and the size and distribution of the eigenvalues .",
    "it is as if the effective dimensionality of the space remained the same but with a pulsating effect on its shape .    to test the dependence of the characteristic dimensions of the space on the number of companies we have added to our set , data of the same ten years period for 36 other large companies represented in the s&p500 index , namely ( tick symbols only ) :    abt , mhp , mel , nyt , nke , oxy , pep , pfe , pha , cbe , adbe , apa , ash , aapl , bac , bk , bax , bdk , cl , xrx , dcn , dal , dg , syy , f , g , hal , eog , hlt , rbk , sgp , slb , unp , uis , whr , gdw .    performing the same analysis as before for this larger set of 70 companies",
    ", we have found that the number of relevant eigenvectors grows from five to six .",
    "the small increase on the number of relevant characteristic dimensions for a set with double the size of the first one , and which covers a wider range of products , is quite remarkable .",
    "it seems to indicate that the systematic factors in the market are relatively few and furthermore , that they may be empirically defined .",
    "finally we illustrate the computation of a set of empirical factors from the geometrical analysis of the first set of 34 companies . a factor model for the returns",
    "@xmath45 is @xmath46 where the @xmath47 are called the intercepts , @xmath48 the factor loadings and @xmath49 the residual random terms .",
    "recall that the first step in our analysis was the embedding of the 34 companies as a set of points in a 33-dimensional space .",
    "the company coordinates are then reduced to the center of mass ( eq.([2.6 ] ) ) and for the computation of the factors we consider equal masses @xmath50 .",
    "the vectors @xmath51 denotes the time series reduced to the center of mass .",
    "@xmath52 the zero - factor @xmath53 is simply the average @xmath54 when the 5 relevant directions are identified , one obtains a 5-dimensional subspace in a 33-dimensional space .",
    "the 5 factors are simply the 5 eigenvectors , associated to the largest eigenvectors , expressed in terms of the time series of the companies .",
    "they are obtained as follows : let @xmath55 be a matrix with columns being the ( center of mass ) coordinates of the normalized eigenvectors and @xmath56 a matrix containing as lines the ( center of mass ) coordinates of companies 2 to 34 . then @xmath57 is a matrix containing , as lines , the ( center of mass ) company coordinates projected on the eigenvectors .",
    "the factors , that is , the largest eigenvectors written in terms of the time series of the companies are @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the center of mass coordinates of the companies 2 to 34 .    performing these operations on our data set ,",
    "we have obtained vanishing @xmath60 intercepts ( @xmath61 ) and factor loadings @xmath48 and variances of the residual random terms @xmath49 as listed below .",
    "these variances are of order 50% of the total variance of each company return .",
    "this might be considered too high a value for a satisfactory factor model .",
    "however it corresponds closely to the sum of the remaining 29 eigenvectors .",
    "these 29 eigenvalues are associated to dimensions which can not be distinguished from those of random data .",
    "therefore one concludes that no reliable improvement beyond the 5-factor model is possible with this data .    in fig .",
    "5 we have plotted the contribution ( @xmath62 ) of each time series to the factors .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "synchronization in the market plays an important role in the occurrence of bubbles and crashes .",
    "synchronization it at the root of the disproportionate impact of public events relative to their intrinsic information content .",
    "this applies to unanticipated public events but also to pre - scheduled news announcements .",
    "our clustering coefficient , as defined in section 2.3 , is indeed a measure of synchronization in the market and as such may provide information independent from other market indicators .",
    "not being constructed from a reduction to a minimum spanning tree , continuous clustering , as we have defined it , contains maximal information on market synchronization . as a first step towards a study of the role of this coefficient",
    "we have studied it for a subset of 25 companies , for which we had much longer time series available .",
    "we define _ volatility _ as the standard deviation of the returns and use centered time windows of 5 and 7 days .    in fig .",
    "6 we compare clustering ( @xmath56 ) and volatility ( @xmath63 ) for the period september 1980 - august 2000 with a time window ( @xmath64 ) of 5 days .",
    "one notices that most ( not all ) volatility peaks also correspond to clustering peaks . however , there are many periods of high clustering which are not associated to very large volatility .",
    "this effect is statistically robust , in the sense that it remains for much larger time windows . in most cases where there are simultaneous volatility and clustering peaks",
    ", clustering decays faster than volatility .",
    "although volatility remains high , synchronization fades out faster after the initial shock .",
    "there are exceptions , though ( see below ) .    in figs . 7 , 8 and 9 we have expanded the periods september 1987 - january 1988 , august 1990 - october 1990 and september 1997 - december 1997 using time windows of 5 and 7 days . in fig .",
    "7 one sees that around october 19 , 1987 ( black monday ) there are both clustering and volatility peaks , but that clustering ( synchronization ) decays faster than volatility .",
    "in addition there is around january 6 , 1988 another clustering peak that is not accompanied by exceptionally high volatility .",
    "another interesting example is provided by fig . 8 where one sees a clustering peak at around august 15 , 1990 with small volatility and a volatility peak after september 5 , 1990 without increase in the clustering . finally , fig .",
    "9 shows that around october 27 , 1997 ( 2nd black monday - asian crisis ) clustering and volatility have very similar behavior .",
    "the main conclusion is that clustering indeed provides some new information on the market which is independent from the one provided by volatility .",
    "together they provide insight on the different types of market shocks .",
    "\\(i ) the main result from our empirical study of the market geometric structure is the dimension reduction that is observed , when compared with the number of companies of different sectors that are analyzed .",
    "this may have useful implications for economic modelling and the identification of subspaces and characteristic dimensions may provide a rationale for the search for _ economic factors _ which are neither sectors nor other obvious economic facts .",
    "\\(ii ) underlying all modern views of asset pricing and portfolio selection is the idea that unsystematic risk may be eliminated by diversification .",
    "a large diversification ( comparable to the whole market ) involves large costs and efficient managing",
    ". it would be much simpler to have a small number of partially anticorrelated stocks .",
    "in addition to providing a rationale for the choice of the number of terms in factor models , our approach also suggests what might be called a dimension - by - dimension ( dbd ) hedging strategy , where diversification is not achieved by mimicking the market portfolio , but by balancing the stocks in appropriate amounts in a few dimensions .",
    "\\(iii ) in our example ( but not necessarily in the method ) we have concentrated on stocks .",
    "nowadays there are on the market a myriad of other more or less risky assets . in principle",
    "the same method also applies to other financial instruments and it may turn out that the nature of the economic spaces reconstructed from different asset types will give us different views on the over - all economic space .",
    "\\(iv ) at a more ambitious level one might think that , once the dimensions of the economic space are identified , a framework is available to establish dynamical equations for the market process .",
    "however , one should remember that the bulk of the market fluctuation process seems to be a short - memory process with a very small long - memory component @xcite , which is nevertheless very important for practical purposes , because it is associated with the large fluctuations of the returns .",
    "therefore separation of the components and reconstruction of their characteristic spaces might be an essential precondition for establishing any meaningful market dynamics description .",
    "\\(v ) there is a great deal of controversy over experimental tests of the market efficiency hypothesis in its weak , semistrong and strong versions . at the theoretical level the modern view of the hypothesis states @xcite",
    "that market overreaction in some circumstances and underreaction in others is a pure chance event . in other words ,",
    "the expected value of abnormal returns is zero .",
    "other views state that a behavioral component @xcite must always be included in any description of the market .",
    "behavioral trends , however , may not be inconsistent with a pure statistical description if the different reaction times and secondary reactions are taken into account @xcite .",
    "our results do suggest the existence of a certain amount of structure in the market .",
    "however it is a result neither in favor nor against the market efficiency hypothesis because even if , by careful consideration of the market structure along the lines we propose in this paper , dimensions and the ambient manifold become well defined , no conclusion can be drawn on the nature of the stochastic process that is taking place there ."
