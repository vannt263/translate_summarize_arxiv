    "during the past decades rrlyrae stars were regarded as useful tools for measuring cosmic distances , but otherwise rather boring stars .",
    "they pulsate radially , and the mechanism of this pulsation assumed to be well - known . a few phenomena , however , challenges this simplistic view . one of them is the blazhko effect @xcite , a periodic amplitude and/or phase variation of the light curves which is shown by about 50 percent of the rrab stars and there is no generally accepted physical explanation ( see e.g @xcite for a present review ) .",
    "the interest in rrlyrae stars has been dramatically increased through the discoveries of photometric space missions corot @xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite .",
    "these objects are either characterized by completely new phenomena , like period - doubling @xcite and low amplitude ( potentially non - radial ) pulsations @xcite , or phenomena which proved to be more frequent in the space - based data compared with the ground - based ones , such as multiperiodic or irregular blazhko effects @xcite .",
    "the observation of by the most satellite @xcite was the first detailed photometric spaceborne observation which was taken on an rrlyrae star .",
    "aqleo is a double - mode pulsating ( rrd ) star : it pulsates in its fundamental and first radial overtone mode simultaneously .",
    "the frequency analysis of aqleo showed that its fourier spectrum contains an additional frequency and its harmonic beyond the expected frequencies of the two radial modes and their linear combinations . after analyzing the corot and _ kepler _ data it turned out that all rrc and rrd stars exhibit such extra modes @xcite .",
    "a common property of these additional modes is their period ratios with the radial overtone periods which is about 0.61 - 0.62 .",
    "the proximity of these numbers to the reciprocal of the famous golden ratio ( 1.618033  ) inspired interesting speculations @xcite about the pulsation dynamics .",
    "lately these additional modes have been found in ground - based data , as well @xcite , what is more , a new group has been identified , where the period ratio is about 0.686 instead of 0.618 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these frequencies have never been detected in any rrab stars , but other low amplitude additional frequencies do appear .",
    "some of them are the half - integer frequencies ( hifs = @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , ) , where @xmath4 is the frequency of the radial fundamental mode .",
    "these are connected to the period doubling effect .",
    "the mostly accepted explanation of this effect is a 9:2 resonance between the fundamental and the 9th radial overtone , a so - called strange mode @xcite .",
    "the physical resonance destabilizes the fundamental fixed point corresponding to the fundamental mode , giving rise to a period doubled dynamical state characterized by alternating maxima and minima in the light curve , and hifs in the fourier spectra .",
    "other low amplitude additional frequencies seem to be related to the first ( @xmath5 ) or second ( @xmath6 ) radial overtones @xcite .",
    "some theoretical model computations confirmed the possibility of triple resonance states where the fundamental , the first overtone and a strange modes are exited simultaneously @xcite .",
    "other resonance combinations ( e.g. fundamental and second overtone ; fundamental , first , and second overtone together ; etc . ) which are detected in real stars , have not been modelled yet .    in the model calculations the appearance of the additional modes",
    "are independent from the blazhko effect , but observations suggest a strong correlation . by unifying the published corot and _ kepler _ blazhko rrab samples @xcite we get 22 stars and among them 17 ( 77% ) show additional frequencies .",
    "if we do the same comparison for non - blazhko stars @xcite we find 2 stars ( and ) among 25 ( 8% ) which pulsate in additional modes , as well .",
    "this paper focuses on these two objects , demonstrating that they are not exceptions in the sense they do show the blazhko effect , albeit with very small amplitude .",
    "we present and analyze those two stars ( v350lyr and kic7021124 ) , where additional small amplitude modes were discovered , but the blazhko effect has not been detected previously . up to now more than a thousand papers based on _ kepler _ data",
    "have been published , so the basic features of the mission are widely known .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for detailed description of the main characteristics of the telescope and the data .",
    "all the technical details are published in the following handbooks : @xcite .",
    "the _ kepler _ photometry of the non - blazhko rrlyrae stars was studied first by @xcite on the basis of the commissioning phase and the first five quarters ( q0-q5 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite , along with the ground - based spectroscopic observations , also published new results from the _ kepler _ photometry of the quarters q0-q11 .",
    "the present paper uses the complete ( q0-q17 ) long cadence ( lc ) _ kepler _ observations .",
    "the _ kepler _ data are publicly available in two forms : light curve ( sap , pdc ) and target pixel files .",
    "the pixel data require more work to extract precise photometry , but for rr lyrae stars which have relatively large amplitudes the pixel data should be more reliable @xcite .",
    "briefly , the predefined apertures of the light curve data are in many cases too small ( that is , they contain too few pixels ) , so some fraction of the stellar flux is lost .",
    "this flux loss is typically time dependent and can cause instrumental trends and amplitude changes . to minimize such effects , we processed the pixel data of the non - blazhko rrlyrae stars in the same manner as we did for the blazhko stars : ( 1 ) we defined a tailor - made aperture for each star and observing quarter , then ( 2 ) we extracted the flux .",
    "( 3 ) the flux data of the different quarters of a star were stitched together by scaling and/or shifting .",
    "( 4 ) finally , we removed the likely instrumental trends and transformed the flux values to the magnitude scale .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for details .",
    "tables  [ sample_data_1 ] and [ sample_data_2 ] show excerpts from the processed data files as an example",
    ". both former studies of non - modulated _ kepler _ rrlyrae stars @xcite used the _ kepler _ light curves .",
    "this letter is the first , where the pixel data of non - blazhko stars are used .",
    "our main tools are the fourier analysis realized by the mufran program package @xcite and the ` observed minus calculated ' ( o@xmath0c ) diagram method ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite determined some basic photometric parameters ( epoch , period , maximum , minimum values , and amplitude ) from their photographic observations .",
    "they assumed a period variation on longer time scale , because they could not find a common period for their maxima and hoffmeister s ones .",
    "after a long hiatus , _ kepler _ entered the scene .",
    "v350lyr was classified by @xcite as a non - blazhko star on the basis of 138  d ( q1-q2 ) _ kepler _ observations though the possibility of a small amplitude blazhko effect below the detection limit was also noted , because the residual spectrum after pre - whitening with the main pulsation frequency @xmath7  d@xmath8 and its harmonics , showed a bunch of small amplitude peaks around each pre - whitened frequency .",
    "an additional frequency at @xmath9  d@xmath8 and its linear combination with the main pulsation frequency was detected as the most interesting feature of this star . at that time v350lyr",
    "was though to be the first and the only example for a non - blazhko rrab star pulsating in an additional mode .",
    "the frequency was identified with the second radial overtone @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite confirmed both findings ( non - blazhko behavior and the excited additional mode ) using the _ kepler _ light curve data from q1-q5 . in the following",
    "we demonstrate that in contrast with earlier results based on shorter _ kepler _ data , v350lyr is indeed a blazhko - modulated star .    to do this",
    ", now we turn to the analysis of the latest available _ kepler _ data .",
    "the fourier spectrum of the rectified light curve based on q1-q17 pixel data is dominated by the main pulsation frequency ( @xmath11  d@xmath8 ) and its harmonics ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "thirteen harmonics can be detected up to the nyquist frequency ( 24.5  d@xmath8 ) . by pre - whitening the light curve with these dominant frequencies , we found multiplet structures around their positions ( top panel in fig .",
    "[ v350_lyr_fr ] ) : @xmath14 , where @xmath13 and @xmath15 or 3 .",
    "assuming that these multiplets are combinations of some modulation side peaks , we can calculate the individual modulation frequencies .",
    "the averaged differences of the @xmath16 frequencies from the two side peaks around @xmath4 are @xmath17  d@xmath8 , @xmath18  d@xmath8 , and @xmath19  d@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "many stars in our sample show a frequency around 0.008  d@xmath8 , so these frequencies together with @xmath20 must be of instrumental origin . some additional instrumental peaks ( e.g. @xmath21 , @xmath22 ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ v350_lyr_fr ] ) are also detectable . here",
    "we define the frequencies belonging to the _ kepler _ year as @xmath23  d@xmath8 and to average the quarter as @xmath24  d@xmath8 .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the intrinsic modulations , the primary and secondary blazhko frequencies , respectively .",
    "it is noticeable , that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are nearly harmonics : @xmath29 .",
    "however , the difference between the exact harmonic and the actual value ( @xmath30 ) is significantly higher than the rayleigh frequency resolution ( @xmath31  d@xmath8 ) .",
    "this means that we are facing a multiperiodic blazhko modulation with nearly resonant frequencies similar to , @xcite and numerous cases in the _ kepler _ blazhko sample @xcite .",
    "the low frequency range of the fourier spectrum ( middle panel in fig .  [ v350_lyr_fr ] )",
    "is dominated by the technical peaks , but @xmath27 ( @xmath32  mmag ) can also be detected .",
    "the peak at @xmath28 , however , is not significant ( @xmath33  mmag ) .",
    "the highest peak between the harmonics is @xmath34  d@xmath8 ( top panel in fig .  [ add ] ) .",
    "we also detect numerous linear combination frequencies ( such as 1.157383  d@xmath8 @xmath35 , 0.525460  d@xmath8 = @xmath36 , 2.314693 = @xmath37 , etc . ) .",
    "the fourier spectrum features clearly demonstrate that v350lyr is a typical blazhko rrlyrae star .",
    "nevertheless , the lc light curve does not show evident modulation .",
    "the rms of the non - linear fit using the main frequency and its harmonics is 0.0062  mag .",
    "this value is 0.0048  mag for the non - modulated which has the closest brightness and period parameters to v350lyr in the _ kepler _ rrlyr sample .",
    "this small difference might be explained by the effect of the additional frequencies of v350lyr .",
    "to clarify the situation we prepared the o@xmath0c diagram , that tests the frequency modulation part of the potential blazhko effect . the o@xmath0c diagram",
    "itself does not show evident modulation , however , its fourier spectrum ( bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ v350_lyr_fr ] ) contains three significant frequencies : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and a third one at @xmath38  d@xmath8 with the amplitudes of @xmath39  d , @xmath40  d , and @xmath41  d , respectively .",
    "the latter frequency belongs to a long period variation ( @xmath42  years ) which has no signs in the light curve or the light curve spectrum .",
    "at the same time @xmath20 can not be detected here in the o@xmath0c spectrum , which supports its technical origin .",
    "v350lyr was observed in sc mode in q7 and for one month in q11.3 .",
    "these observations give us an additional opportunity to check the blazhko nature of this star .",

    "the o@xmath0c diagram shows @xmath38  d@xmath8 beyond the two blazhko frequencies .",

    ", width=321 ]    the additional mode of kic7021124 was discovered by @xcite making this star the second non - blazhko star showing additional mode at that time .",
    "@xcite found this star to be very similar to v350lyr in many aspects ( e.g. mass , luminosity , fourier parameters ) . at that time",
    "only q1 data were available . here",
    "we deprive this star of this privileged status , as well .    using the entire data set from q1 to q17",
    "we do not find significant amplitude modulation .",
    "the pre - whitened spectrum does not show distinct side peaks around the harmonics of the main pulsation period @xmath49  d@xmath8 and the significant peaks in the low frequency range are presumably technical .",
    "the spectrum contains an additional frequency @xmath50  d@xmath8 ( see bottom panel in fig .  [ add ] ) and some of its linear combination ( e.g. @xmath51 ) , but generally it is more simple than the spectrum of v350lyr .    the o@xmath0c diagram , however , shows a clear period change ( middle panel in fig .  [ o - c_k ] ) .",
    "the shape of the o@xmath0c curve is close to , but not strictly sinusoidal . in the fourier spectrum of this o@xmath0c diagram",
    "there are two significant peaks at @xmath52  d@xmath8 , ( @xmath53  d ) and at @xmath54  d@xmath8 , ( @xmath55  d ) .",
    "further peaks can not be detected in the higher frequency range .",
    "these frequencies yield a rough period estimation of around @xmath56  d , since the variation period  if it is periodic at all  is comparable to the total observing time .",
    "the appearance of the overtone indicates the non strictly sinusoidal nature of the variation .",
    "the similar period of @xmath57 and @xmath58 raises the possibility that these variations result from instrumental effects .",
    "some facts contradict such a scenario .",
    "( 1 ) it is highly unlikely that there are problems with the time measurements of _ kepler_. ( 2 ) the amplitude @xmath53  d=1.55  min is much higher than that of the longest period of v350lyr ( @xmath41  d=0.4  min ) .",
    "( 3 ) the phase of these two similar time - scale variations are also different ( cf . top and middle panels in fig .",
    "[ o - c_k ] ) .",
    "all in all , both variations described by @xmath57 and @xmath58 seem to be real .",
    "the question of their nature however , remains .    in the case of",
    "v350lyr we have already mentioned some possible scenarios .",
    "the frequency modulation due to a long period blazhko effect would be an adequate explanation for kic7021124 as well , because blazhko cycles of long characteristic time scales are known @xcite .",
    "the only problem is the lack of the amplitude modulation .",
    "it is known , however , that if we characterize the light curve with the fourier parameters defined by @xcite , the amplitude ratio @xmath59 is very sensitive to the amplitude changes and is highly unaffected by technical problems .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ o - c_k ] shows the variation of @xmath48 in time .",
    "the diagram was constructed with the period04 program @xcite .",
    "the @xmath48 parameter shows a long - term variation , very similar to that of the o@xmath0c values .",
    "the phase of the long time - scale variation is correlated with the o@xmath0c diagram .",
    "simultaneous amplitude and frequency variation constitutes a strong evidence for the presence of the blazhko effect in this object .",
    "its small amplitude and long cycle prevented its detection until now .",
    "we extracted and presented the time series of two rr lyrae stars ( v350lyr and kic7021124 )  which were formerly known as un - modulated ones showing additional excited small amplitude periodicites .",
    "we used the _ kepler _ pixel data and our tailor - made apertures to minimize flux loss .",
    "the flux curves were scaled , shifted and de - trended in the same way as was done for the blazhko stars @xcite .    the study of these two stars resulted in evidence for the blazhko behavior in both cases . in the case of v350lyr",
    "we demonstrated that this star shows simultaneous amplitude and frequency modulations with two small amplitude frequencies with nearly 1:2 ratio .",
    "kic7021124 is also a blazhko star with extremely low amplitude modulation at about the _ kepler _",
    "detection limit , featuring a significant long - period frequency modulation .",
    "the smallest known blazhko am amplitude so far has been 0.6  mmag for v838cyg @xcite .",
    "the secondary am modulation amplitude of v350lyr has the same amplitude , however , this object shows multiple modulations with the smallest amplitude components ( 0.6 and 0.8  mmag ) ever found .",
    "kic7021124 is also a record holder : it has by far the longest blazhko period with such a small amplitude .",
    "a possible trend was reported between the blazhko period and the amplitude of the am parts of the effect ( see in fig .  9 in @xcite ) .",
    "kic7021124 seems to diverge from this trend .",
    "this points out that the trend might partially be a sampling effect : long period and small amplitude modulations can hardly be detected even from space .",
    "we mention that these two stars are the most metal poor stars in the _ kepler _ blazhko sample : v350lyr has [ fe / h]=@xmath60  dex , and kic7021124 has [ fe / h]=@xmath61  dex @xcite .",
    "the more metal poor rrlyrae stars in the sample ( nrlyr , fnlyr , nqlyr ) are all non - blazhko stars .",
    "is the amplitude of the am part of the blazhko effect related to the metallicity ?",
    "a direct metallicity ",
    "am amplitude relation can be ruled out because e.g. v838cyg has also small am amplitude but it is the most metal rich ( [ fe / h]=@xmath62  dex ) among the _ kepler _ blazhko stars . if we complement the _ kepler _ blazhko sample with v350lyr and kic7021124 we find that the metallicities of the non - blazhko stars distribute over a wider range ( between @xmath63 and @xmath64  dex ) than that of the blazhko stars ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) . what is even more interesting : both the extremely metal rich and metal poor blazhko stars exhibit extremely low am amplitude .",
    "on the basis of the corot and _ kepler _ blazhko samples  and since both objects studied here proved to be blazhko stars  we can provide a _ strict rule for rrab stars : the additional modes appear only in the presence of the blazhko effect_. in this case we were able to deduce the blazhko nature for those stars where the blazhko cycle is long ( much longer than the observed time span ) , but some excited additional modes are evident .",
    "this situation will be common in the relatively short observing runs of k2 @xcite and tess @xcite .",

    "<S> recent photometric space missions , such as corot and _ kepler _ revealed that many rr lyrae stars pulsate  beyond their main radial pulsation mode  in low amplitude modes . </S>",
    "<S> space data seem to indicate a clear trend , namely overtone ( rrc ) stars and modulated fundamental ( rrab ) rrlyrae stars ubiquitously show additional modes , while non - blazhko rrab stars never do . </S>",
    "<S> two _ kepler _ stars ( v350lyr and kic7021124 ) , however , apparently seemed to break this rule : they were classified as non - blazhko rrab stars showing additional modes . </S>",
    "<S> we processed _ </S>",
    "<S> kepler _ </S>",
    "<S> pixel photometric data of these stars . </S>",
    "<S> we detected small amplitude , but significant blazhko effect for both stars by using the resulted light curves and o@xmath0c diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> this finding strengthens the apparent connection between the blazhko effect and the excitation of additional modes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it yields a potential tool for detecting blazhko stars through the additional frequency patterns even if we have only short but accurate time series observations . </S>",
    "<S> v350 lyr shows the smallest amplitude multiperiodic blazhko effect ever detected . </S>"
