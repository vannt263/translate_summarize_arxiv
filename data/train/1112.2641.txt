    "to realize a quantum computer in the circuit model , it is crucial to have precise control over each of the carriers of quantum information . in addition to keeping the quantum state of the computer protected from unavoidable noise induced by the environment ,",
    "it is necessary to implement suitable quantum gates , usually in the form of one and two qubits gates .",
    "the latter is of particular difficulty , especially when optical quantum systems are used because their interaction is either weak or merely induced by measurements .",
    "the paradigm of measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc ) as pioneered by raussendorf and briegel @xcite and substantially generalized by gross and eisert @xcite allows to get rid of the necessity of performing unitary operations to implement a quantum circuit . instead",
    ", the actual computation is performed by preparing a multipartite entangled state , the resource , in a first step followed by adaptively chosen local measurements on this resource .",
    "the important improvement stems from the fact that the resource is universal , i.e. , it can be prepared independently of the algorithm one wants to perform .",
    "this means that the presumably difficult step , the one which involves entangling operations , can be performed off - line .",
    "this resource - preparation may also be probabilistic as it is possible to wait with the implementation of the algorithm until the resource is available .",
    "what is more , individual addressing in the final read out step is anyway also required in the circuit model , so this step does not add any further difficulty to the scheme .    quantum computing based on continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum optical systems differs from the more conventional notion based on their discrete analogues in not making use of single photons as the carriers of quantum information @xcite .",
    "instead , it relies to a large extent on gaussian states and their manipulation .",
    "the notable advantage is that gaussian states are easier to prepare in the laboratory , the corresponding interactions are often stronger and easier to accomplish , and some measurements , e.g. , homodyne detection , can be performed with an efficiency substantially surpassing the one of single - photon measurements .",
    "however , quantum information protocols using gaussian states only , gaussian operations , and gaussian measurements suffer from serious limitations as in this setting neither entanglement distillation @xcite nor error correction against gaussian errors @xcite is possible .",
    "also , since one can easily efficiently keep track of first and second moments , any gaussian evolution of gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer @xcite , clearly ruling out as the possibility of universal quantum computing .",
    "mbqc based on gaussian resource states has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite due to several features : they are a direct generalization of the well known qubit cluster - state to the continuous - variable regime , they allow for universal quantum computing with gaussian measurements and a single non - gaussian one , and they can be prepared with present day experimental techniques , as already demonstrated . however , if they are not formed out of idealized infinitely squeezed states ( ones that are not contained in hilbert space and would require infinite energy in preparation ) but rather from physical states possessing only finite squeezing , they suffer from exponentially decaying localizable entanglement .",
    "this limitation , which applies to any gaussian resource state irrespectively of the permitted class of measurements @xcite , implies that full error correction and the machinery of fault - tolerant quantum computing @xcite , in parts yet to be developed for such continuous - variable systems , appears to be necessary even when both state preparation and measurements are perfect .",
    "notably , those restrictions only apply when trying to perform a quantum computation of an _ unbounded _ length . for any _ finite _ length ,",
    "there exists , for any required accuracy , a physical cluster state such that any quantum operation up to this length is possible with this accuracy .",
    "because the widely assumed superior power of quantum computers compared to classical ones manifests itself most prominently in the scaling of the runtime with the problem size , the situation of a quantum computation with unbounded length is in the focus of attention in this work .",
    "in addition to schemes based on gaussian cluster states , two more classes of schemes relying on cv - quantum optics have been proposed .",
    "the first one is based on superpositions of coherent states which are called schrdinger cat states or , when they have very low amplitude , kitten states @xcite .",
    "they can be , in approximation , created by subtracting photons from squeezed states and allow for universal quantum computing by passive operations such as beam - splitters and photon - counting detection only .",
    "however , they also suffer from quite severe problems : the probabilistic nature of the quantum operations stemming from the use of non - overlapping basis - elements seems to be the most fundamental one , giving rise to significant overheads .",
    "the second approach combines the advantageous features of both discrete and continuous - variable optics @xcite . in these schemes ,",
    "quantum information is carried by qubits and single qubit operations are performed directly on them .",
    "two - qubit operations , in contrast , are performed by letting both qubits interact with a strong cv - mode , the qubus .    with this article ,",
    "we pursue two different , but complementary goals : on the one hand , we aim at clarifying the boundary between settings where cv - mbqc is possible and such situations where this is not the case . for this reason",
    ", we will develop a general framework capable of describing quantum computation in the measurement - based paradigm , regardless of the dimension of the carriers of quantum information . within this picture",
    ", we can identify some serious limitations giving rise to challenges that have to be overcome . on the other hand ,",
    "we introduce a first strictly efficient scheme relying only on a simple controlled rotation , which can be realized by an atom - light interaction of the jaynes - cummings type or purely optically by the kerr effect , for the creation of the resource . on the measurement side , we require beamsplitters , phase - space displacers , and photon counting measurements . while this scheme is not fleshed out in all detail of its concrete physical implementation , it should be clear that quantum optical implementations of such ideas are conceivable .",
    "the present article is organized as follows : first , we discuss what operations are possible with continuous - variable quantum systems and introduce a framework based on matrix product states ( mps ) to describe mbqc in a general setting . after a discussion of the properties which a cv - mbqc scheme needs to posses in order to be called theoretically efficient , we show the problems of achieving those requirements with gaussian measurements on non - gaussian resource states .",
    "last , we provide an example for a feasible scheme and discuss in detail how efficient mbqc can be performed in this situation .",
    "when performing tasks of quantum information with continuous - variable quantum optics different classes of operations are considered to be of different difficulty .",
    "this is also true for measurements where the achievable efficiency greatly differs between the various methods .      before continuing with the discussion , we remind the reader of some basic properties of gaussian states and operations while also taking the opportunity to set the notation .",
    "we consider a single light mode .",
    "the energy eigenvectors of the unit oscillator are denoted by @xmath0 with @xmath1 .",
    "the annihilation operator @xmath2 acts on them according to @xmath3 .",
    "the commutator relation with its adjoint , the creation operator , is @xmath4=1 $ ] , setting @xmath5 .",
    "the eigenvectors of the photon - number operator @xmath6 with @xmath7 are called the number states or fock states .",
    "one can now define the canonical operators or quadratures as @xmath8 and for @xmath9 $ ] the family of rotated quadrature operators @xmath10 the latter family of observables is the one that captures homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "gaussian unitaries are the ones which can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 contains no terms in higher than quadratic order in @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( or , equivalently , in @xmath2 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "there are three classes of gaussian single - mode unitary operators into which all gaussian unitary gates can be decomposed .",
    "the first ones are corresponding to the application of the displacement operator @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "such a transformation is reflected in the heisenberg picture by a map of the form @xmath18 optically , such a transformation can be realized by mixing the mode with a second mode , which is in a strong coherent state , on a beam splitter in the limit of vanishing reflectivity . in the second one",
    "are the transformations generated by the clockwise rotation operator @xmath19 , which can be realized by a phase shifter , acting on the canonical operators as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , while in the last one are those generated by the squeezing operator @xmath22,\\ ] ] acting as @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the single - mode gaussian unitary operations form a ( non - compact ) group which we denote by @xmath25 . to complete the set of operators , which are necessary to implement arbitrary _ multi - mode _ gaussian operations",
    ", we introduce the ( absorption - free ) beam splitter acting on two modes @xmath26 and @xmath27 by @xmath28\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the transmission and reflection coefficient , respectively .",
    "the gaussian operations can be divided into two classes : phase shifters and beam splitters do not change the total number of photons and are called passive operations . to implement a squeezer or a displacer , on the other hand , one does need additional photon sources which makes them more difficult to realize .",
    "there are also non - gaussian operations which are within the realm of present experimental techniques : the cross kerr effect gives rise to a non - linear coupling between two modes ; its hamiltonian reads @xmath31 it can be realized by transmitting two modes together through an optically non - linear medium . as non - linear optical effects are weak and absorption needs to be kept low , the achievable effective coupling strength is quite small , i.e. , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the interaction time . for the most relevant situation , where one of the modes carries a state with many photons",
    "while the other one is in the single photon regime , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : crosskerr ] ) has already been experimentally implemented to perform quantum non - demolition measurement ( qnd ) @xcite .",
    "the related hamiltonian @xmath34 for a positive @xmath35 describes the coupling of a two - level atom to a light mode in the dispersive limit of the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "in this situation , the effective coupling strength can be increased by placing the mode and the atom inside an optical cavity .",
    "a particularly strong interaction can be achieved with a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) which is routinely used to exchange quantum information between between light modes and atomic vapors and for which also experiments with single atoms exist @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the kind of measurements that we will consider feasible for the purposes of this work .",
    "the most important gaussian measurement scheme is homodyne dectection which correponds to the observable @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rotq ] ) .",
    "it is realized by combining the mode with a strong laser , called the local oscillator , in an interferometer , measuring the intensities on both output ports , and subtracting the results .",
    "another important type of gaussian measurement is eight - port homodyning corresponding to a direct measurement of the q - function , i.e.,@xmath37 for @xmath17 , where @xmath38 are the state vectors of the non - orthogonal and overcomplete coherent states @xcite .",
    "non - gaussian measurements are in many instances more difficult to realize than gaussian ones , and usually with significantly lower detection efficiencies .",
    "the most feasible instance of a non - gaussian measurement reflects a single - photon detector which can only distinguish between the absence of photons and the presence of one or more photons .",
    "the corresponding povm - elements are @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "a photon - number resolving detector is more challenging to implement but with time - multiplexing @xcite or superconducting nano - wires @xcite , it is possible to perform photon counting for the first few number states with reasonable efficiency .",
    "in this section , we introduce a general framework to describe measurement - based quantum computing . a mbqc scheme consists two ingredients : first , a resource state and second a set of possible , or allowed local measurements .",
    "we start with a description of quantum wires which are used for single - qudit processing @xcite and discuss their coupling to fully universal resources afterwards .",
    "the formalism of matrix product states , which was originally introduced to describe a certain class of entangled one - dimensional many - body states @xcite is extremely useful to capture the essentials of quantum computing in the measurement based model @xcite .",
    "we start by describing one - dimensional continuous - variable quantum wires which can be used to carry a single qubit of quantum information .",
    "the techniques we develop are independent of the actual physical implementation but we will often describe them with terms of quantum optics and have such a system in mind .",
    "we consider a chain of @xmath41 quantum systems with dimension @xmath42 which are called lattice sites .",
    "we also allow for the situation @xmath43 which describes cv light modes .",
    "we say that a state is physical if it has finite mean energy , i.e. , for a single mode : @xmath44 .",
    "we choose a basis ( or a countably infinite hilbert - space basis ) @xmath45 of @xmath46 , which we call the computational basis , associate to any basis element a @xmath47-dimensional matrix @xmath48\\in\\mathcal{m}_d({{\\mathbbm{c}}})$ ] , and write a translationally invariant matrix product state ( mps ) as @xmath49\\ldots a[i_2]a[i_1]|r\\rangle|i_l,\\ldots , i_2,i_1\\rangle \\label{eq : mpsdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 .",
    "this vector space is the one where the quantum computation will take place and is called correlation space .",
    "the matrices must fulfill the completeness relation @xmath51^\\dag a[i]={\\mathbbm{1}},\\ ] ] for rendering deterministic computation feasible .",
    "an important fact is that all physical states can be approximated arbitrary well by a finite - dimensional mps .",
    "as any finite - dimensional state can be written as a mps @xcite , it only remains to show that one can truncate states with finite energy .",
    "we write the mean total photon number of a state @xmath52 with @xmath53 modes as @xmath54 where the matrix elements of @xmath52 are the ones of the fock basis .",
    "let @xmath55 be the non - normalized state obtained from @xmath52 by setting @xmath56 if one of the indices is larger than @xmath57 .",
    "this state fulfills @xmath58 denoting the trace norm , which is the relevant norm for the distinguishability of quantum states , by @xmath59 , we get from ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath60    if we assume the mean photon number ( the energy ) _ per mode _ to be constant , the truncation error is independent of the system size .",
    "this means , for a given required accuracy , we can choose a cut - off number @xmath57 independently of the length of the intended computation .",
    "we now show how single - qudit mbqc can be performed with such a matrix product state , following and extending the line of reasoning used in ref .",
    "let us assume , the first mode is measured in the computational basis with result @xmath53 .",
    "then , the remaining system is described by the state vector @xmath61\\ldots a[i_2]a[k]|r\\rangle|i_l,\\ldots , i_2\\rangle .",

    "an equivalent formulation is that @xmath74 must not depend on the state vector @xmath68 of the correlation space .",
    "if this was the case , a measurement would yield information about @xmath68 , which would clearly destroy coherence .",
    "a possible way of preparing a matrix product state with bond dimension @xmath47 is a sequential interaction with a @xmath47-dimensional auxiliary system @xcite .",
    "this picture proves to be extraordinarily useful when discussing quantum wires .",

    "it is important to note that this picture works regardless of the actual way the resource state is prepared .",
    "for this reason , we will use the picture of sequential preparation to be more intuitive while maintaining full generality .",

    "one possibility is to let the auxiliary systems of the sequential preparation scheme interact .",
    "however , this might be very challenging to do in reality , both when working with atoms , due to the difficulty of controlling them , and with light , due to weak non - linear interaction .",
    "for this reason , joint measurements are preferable to couple two wires which is also shown in figure [ fig : coupling ] . in an optical situation",
    ", this could mean to combine two modes belonging to two different wires on a beam splitter and measuring both output ports .",

    "the root of the latter limitation is the insufficient possibility to control what quantum gate is performed .      up to now , we have only considered resource - states where the physical dimension is finite .",
    "we demonstrate the difference between states with and without support on a finite number of fock states with the help of an example where the resource state is described by the matrices @xmath146=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mathcal{n}}}\\left(f(x){\\mathbbm{1}}+ig(x)z\\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath205 to ensure the normalization condition @xmath206^\\dag a[x]={\\mathbbm{1}}.\\ ] ] both @xmath207 and @xmath208 are chosen to be real , even functions .",

    "this is efficiently possible .",
    "this concludes the proof that the proposed scheme is efficient .",
    "as already mentioned , the coupling scheme discussed so far is not completely in the mbqc - paradigm because it involves the adaptive coupling of sites .",

    "( [ eq : beamsplittera ] ) .",
    "because @xmath272 , two consecutive couplings can be undone by appropriately choosing local operations between them . from eq .",

    "thus , for a fixed probability of success , @xmath53 has only to grow as @xmath278 , which means that the need for two - site measurements can be removed for the price of a polylog overhead . for a quantum circuit consisting of more than two wires ,",
    "as depicted in figure [ fig : realmbqc ] , every wire should be alternately coupled to its left and right neighbor .",
    "when the circuits consists of @xmath279 quantum wire with all have a length @xmath103 , the respective overhead behaves as @xmath280 .",
    "non - adaptive coupling of four quantum wires where the wiggly lines denote the probabilistic measurement - based @xmath264 gate . by scaling the distance between the single couplings polylogarithmically in the length of the computation , the total probability of failure can be made arbitrarily small . ]      even if a model fulfills the theoretical requirements it will still be affected by noise .",
    "thus , error correction will be necessary to build a scalable quantum computer . in the scheme presented above , one plausible dominant source of errors",
    "is reflecting the finite efficiency of the photon - counting measurement needed to perform both single and two qubit gates .",
    "if photon loss happens , a `` wrong '' operation is applied in the two - dimensional correlation space .",
    "when the rate of these qubit errors is low enough , techniques of error correction and fault - tolerant quantum computing may be applied to make a computation with unbounded length possible at the expense of a polylogarithmic overhead @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the errors stemming from the use of finitely squeezed states in the scheme based on gaussian cluster states for which no method of error correction exists yet to achieve fault tolerance .    beside of the obvious errors stemming from decoherence and imperfections in the measurement procedure ,",
    "the presented continuous variable schemes have an important additional source of errors .",
    "for example , when performing a shifted photon counting , uncertainty in the parameter of the shift operator @xmath281 results in uncertainty of the applied operator . we now investigate how those errors scale with the length of the computation .",

    "if this is not the case , an tight upper bound to the error is @xmath287 i.e. , it grows , in the worst case , exponentially in @xmath103 . in the mbqc - scheme based on gaussian cluster states as discussed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the implemented gates are not unitary for physical resource states which is the reason for the exponential decay of the transport fidelity @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the possibilities provided by measurement - based quantum computing with continuous - variable resources . after introducing a framework allowing for the description of a huge class of possible resource states , we have clarified which conditions are necessary for a cv - mbqc scheme to be viable .",
    "those conditions lead to new limitations .",
    "especially , we have shown that , without the use of not yet developed continuous - variable error correction , scalable quantum computing with gaussian measurements alone is impossible , even if the resource state is non - gaussian , complementing the prior result which prohibits mbqc with gaussian resources , even if the measurements are non - gaussian . as the second main result , we gave an explicit example of an efficient mbqc scheme where the resource could be created by a simple interaction between light modes in coherent states and some qubit degrees of freedom .",
    "processing is then performed by shifted photon counting while entangling two - qubit gates rely on simple beam splitters .",
    "an analysis of errors highlighted the qualitative differences of the two major kinds of errors .",
    "two major conclusions can be drawn from our findings : first , continuous - variable measurement based quantum computing is an extraordinarily difficult enterprise .",
    "second , when non - gaussian resource states are combined with non - gaussian measurements , efficient schemes do exist , and in this work , we introduce such first strictly efficient schemes . while this may be disappointing when aiming at a scalable optical quantum computer , one does need to keep in mind , that our statements about efficiency only address the asymptotic behavior .",
    "thus , the limitation do not at all rule out the usefulness of much simpler protocols in situations where only a few modes are used .",
    "such situations include quantum repeaters and hybrid entanglement - distribution protocols for applications particularly in quantum cryptography .",
    "hence , for such purposes , both the purely gaussian setting as well as those non - gaussian schemes that asymptotically do not give rise to universal quantum computing can well be feasible as elementary tools for entanglement distillation schemes .",
