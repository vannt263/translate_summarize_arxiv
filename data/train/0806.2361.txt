    "riemann showed that @xmath144 thus , if there exists a zero @xmath76 of @xmath13 with @xmath145 then there exists a zero of @xmath13 at a symmetric point in @xmath146 .",

    "since @xmath75 and all derivatives with respect to @xmath87 vanish , @xmath120 for every point @xmath87 to which the function is continued .",

    "lemma 5 proves the riemann hypothesis if we can show the following conjecture .",

    "argument : _ let us assume that @xmath63 is a zero of @xmath13 and @xmath155 .",
    "the proof of lemma 3 works for @xmath41 in the same way as for @xmath86 if we show that @xmath61 is continuous at @xmath123 .",
    "in fact , if the proof of lemma 3 fails for @xmath41 , then @xmath66 and @xmath156 for an arbitrarily small @xmath157 .",
    "let @xmath158 be very large .",

    "if @xmath158 is large , the function is analytic .",
    "it can be continued to smaller values of @xmath158 , except to points when it becomes infinite , by analytic continuation .",
    "especially , the analytic continuation is continuous .",
    "thus , @xmath67 is continuous at @xmath32 since @xmath162 is not infinite .",
    "the argument is finished .",
    "if the argument for conjecture 1 is valid , then the riemann hypothesis holds . the proof is elementary and uses known methods , though functions of several complex variables may not be common in this context .",
    "the proof is , however , very much in line with the original thoughts that the riemann hypothesis is a problem of complex analysis and not of number theory , and that the hypothesis is a consequence of the convergence of the harmonic series , not of deep , and to us unknown , properties of prime numbers . just as the pole of @xmath13 at @xmath3 and nonexistence of zeroes or poles for @xmath47 is a consequence of the harmonic series , in conjecture 1 , the zeroes at @xmath163 and the riemann hypothesis are a consequence of convergence of @xmath39 .",
    "it is not correct to claim that the proof only uses the increasing property of primes .",
    "the regions of convergence are those of the harmonic series .",
    "the proof in fact uses all information we know of all primes : that their products make up all integers and that the harmonic series converges on a certain area ."
