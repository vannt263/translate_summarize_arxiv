    "lovelock theories are the natural extension of the general relativity theory of gravity given by the einstein - hilbert action to higher dimensions and higher curvature interactions .",
    "the equations of motion do not involve terms with more than two derivatives of the metric , avoiding the appearance of ghosts @xcite .",
    "much work has been done on the main properties of lovelock gravity due to their interest as models where our knowledge of gravity can be tested and extended .",
    "for example , the vacua structure , the existence and properties of black holes such as their mass , entropy and thermodynamics , the gravitational phase transitions , the cosmological implications , etc . have been the object of an important amount of literature during the last years .",
    "nevertheless , the main motivation for this review article comes from the ads / cft correspondence , famously conjectured by juan maldacena some 15 years ago @xcite .",
    "this is nowadays well - stablished as a duality between quantum gravity theories in ads space - times and conformal field theories living at the boundary .",
    "it is in that sense that the correspondence is dubbed customarily as the _",
    "holographic duality_. originally formulated for @xmath0-dimensional ads and @xmath1-dimensional cft , lots of evidence accumulated over the years pointing towards its validity in higher and lower dimensions .",
    "lovelock theories have a rich structure of ads vacua , which should be in correspondence with a similarly rich structure of higher dimensional cfts .",
    "it is worth recalling at this point , however , that little is known about these higher dimensional cfts .",
    "not even their existence is clear .",
    "it has been argued that , in the supersymmetric case , there can be non trivial unitary cfts in six dimensions , whose duals are seven dimensional gravity theories .",
    "lovelock theories provide a useful framework to unravel some of the properties of higher dimensional cfts , and also to test our understanding of the holographic duality when higher curvature terms come into play from the gravity side .",
    "the subject is vast and it is far from our aim to cover it all . at those points where we consider that our presentation reduces to a bird s eye view , we will suggest further material where the interested reader can find more detailed explanations .    the article is organized as follows :",
    "we present the main features of lovelock gravity using the first order formalism in section [ lovelock ] . in section [ adscft ]",
    "we review how constraints on the cft parameters are obtainted by holographically computing the two - point and three - point functions of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "the constraints come from unitarity and positivity of the energy .",
    "section [ causality ] is devoted to the analysis of possible causality violations by considering the scattering of gravitons against shock waves propagating in a lovelock ads background .",
    "the results are in agreement with those of section [ adscft ] and also with the ones obtained by a similar calculation performed in the perturbed black hole background dual to a thermal field theory .",

    "some four decades ago , david lovelock derived a formal expression for the most general , symmetric and conserved tensor which is quasi - linear in the second derivatives of the metric without any higher derivatives in arbitrary space - time dimensionality @xcite .",
    "they provide an interesting playground to explore the effect of higher curvature terms in the framework of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "very recent reviews on general aspects of this theory include @xcite .      for the sake of making progress in the study of lovelock theory , it is convenient to use differential forms and the exterior algebra ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . instead of the metric and affine connection",
    ", we will be referring to orthonormal frames ( or _ vielbein _ ) and spin connection ( or connection 1-form ) @xcite .",
    "this formalism will make our expressions much more compact and also the manipulations much easier .",
    "the vielbein is a non - coordinate basis which provides an orthonormal basis for the tangent space at each point on the manifold , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4-dimensional minkowski metric with @xmath5 signature .",
    "the latin indices @xmath6 are _ flat _ or _ tangent space indices _ , while the greek ones @xmath7 are _ curved _ or _ spacetime indices_. in some cases we will also distinguish spacelike @xmath8 from timelike ones .",
    "the vielbein are @xmath4 1-forms , @xmath9 that we may use in order to rewrite the metric as @xmath10 we also need to introduce the metric compatible ( antisymmetric ) connection 1-form @xmath11 that is necessary in order to deal with tensor valued differential forms .",
    "in addition to the usual exterior derivative , @xmath12 , we define the _ covariant _ exterior derivative , @xmath13 , that reduces to the former when applied to a scalar valued form . for a general @xmath14-tensor valued form",
    "@xmath15 we can in this way define the torsion and curvature 2-forms as derivatives of , respectively , the vielbein and the spin connection @xmath16 r^{ab } & : = & { \\mathrm{d}}{\\omega}^{ab}+{\\omega}^{a}_{\\ c}\\wedge { \\omega}^{cb}=\\frac{1}{2 } r_{~b\\mu\\nu}^{a}\\ ; dx^{\\mu } \\wedge dx^{\\nu } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] known as the cartan structure equations .",
    "the covariant derivative of cartan s equations give the bianchi identities @xmath17 we will consider a sector of lovelock theory where the torsion vanishes .",
    "this is not the most general situation , but it will suffice the purpose of this article . in the absence of torsion ,",
    "the spin connection is not independent from the metric and coincides with the levi - civita connection , @xmath18 in gr the torsion tensor is constrained to vanish .",
    "when this constraint is not imposed , we have the einstein - cartan theories .",
    "these are very important when considering spinor fields as these generally source the spin connection .    for later use ,",

    "this latter expression is cumbersome enough to shed light on the reasons why it is much more convenient to work with expressions like ( [ llaction - k ] ) rather than the usual tensorial formalism .    in first order formalism",

    "even though the first term in ( [ spineq ] ) is irrelevant for the matter of discussing solutions to the lovelock equations , it contributes to the variation of the action in such a way that we need to include boundary terms analogous to that of gibbons and hawking @xcite for general relativity .",
    "these terms precisely cancel the previous boundary contributions so that the lovelock action defines a well posed variational problem . in the same way as the lovelock terms are the ( dimensionally continued ) euler densities for manifolds in @xmath47 dimensions , the corresponding boundary terms appear in the generalization of the gauss - bonnet theorem to manifolds with boundaries @xcite @xmath48 ~ , \\label{llboundary}\\ ] ]",

    "the second equation of motion is obtained by varying the action with respect to the vielbein .",
    "it can be casted into the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 being a function of the lovelock couplings .",
    "this expression involves just the curvature 2-form and no extra covariant derivatives , making explicit the two derivative character of the lovelock equations of motion . also , for the critical dimension @xmath54 , the @xmath55 term contribution to the equations of motion vanishes . in our approach",
    "this is simply due to the absence of vielbein fields in the corresponding action term , thus yielding zero upon variation .",
    "more generally , the integral of that term becomes a topological invariant , the euler number for that particular dimension . in dimensions lower than the critical one the corresponding lovelock term",
    "exactly vanishes and we are led to the restriction ( [ maximalk ] ) .",

    "the effective cosmological constants correspond to the ( inverse squared of the ) possible radii of these ( a)ds spaces and should not be confused with the bare cosmological constant , @xmath60 appearing in the action .",
    "the theory will have degenerate behavior whenever two or more effective cosmological constants coincide .",

    "then , we can consider a wave packet moving with definite momentum on both sides of the shock wave .",
    "we can find a matching condition just by integrating the corresponding equation of motion along the discontinuity , @xmath241 where @xmath242 and @xmath243 are the values of the perturbation at both sides of the discontinuity , and we used @xmath244 .",
    "we can find the shift in the momentum in the @xmath245-direction acting with @xmath246 , @xmath247 if we consider a particle going inside ads , @xmath248 .",
    "the momentum in the radial direction will change sign the perturbation coming back to the boundary after the collision , provided @xmath249 for sufficiently large @xmath250 ( since the black hole originating the shock wave had positive mass ) .",
    "now , both @xmath251 and @xmath69 are negative , the former simply due to the fact that @xmath252 ( and @xmath253 must be positive for the energy to be so ) . therefore , when @xmath254 for all three helicities , the graviton will make its way back to the boundary and , as we can thoroughly read from ( [ matching ] ) ,     corresponds to the shock wave while the line @xmath255 corresponds to the graviton . after the collision ,",

    "we conclude that the theory violates causality unless @xmath259 for the three helicity channels , which amounts exactly to the same constraints found in the black hole case and , as well , to those arising from positivity of the energy in the dual cft , displayed in ( [ t2channels ] ) .",
    "as we have seen throughout these pages , lovelock theories of gravity appear as a very useful playground in order to analyze several aspects of the gauge / gravity duality .",
    "the precise status of these theories is at present unclear , as they do not generally appear in the low energy action of string theory , at least not with finite coefficients , and their ultraviolet completion is unknown . although this is true , lovelock gravities are two derivative theories , the most natural extension of general relativity in higher dimensions , and there is no a priori reason why these can not appear as classical limits of a quantum theory of gravity , thus subject to the holographic principle .    from the cft point of view ,",
    "moreover , the inclusion of these higher curvature terms allows for the description of more general field theories , a notable example being strongly coupled cfts with different central charges , @xmath260 , in four dimensions @xcite at leading order in the large n limit . besides",
    ", the analysis of the would be cft duals of lovelock gravities has lead to some very interesting and unsuspected insights .",
    "one that has been extensively reviewed in this article is the relation between causality and positivity of the energy .",
    "our analysis indicates that the violation of the positivity constraints leads to the appearance of superluminal modes propagating in the field theory . using purely field theory techniques",
    "it has been shown that the same constraints are needed to avoid the presence of ghosts at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been devoted in the last few years to the analysis of some of the preeminent features of lovelock theory such as its black hole solutions , their thermodynamics and phase transitions , their would be instabilities and the generic existence of more than one maximally symmetric solution or _",
    "vacuum_. even though it seems to us that the last word has not been said , the results obtained so far indicate that there is no obvious pathology that invalidates the consideration of these theories once and for all , at least for some ( finite ) region of the parameter space that includes the einstein - hilbert case .",
    "some authors have pointed to some instabilities that quite generically appear in these theories as being a sign of their _",
    "sickness_. much on the contrary , these instabilities have been found to play a central rle in the dynamics of the theory .",
    "for instance , they generically prevent the formation of naked singularities thus being instrumental in the _ cosmic censorship hypothesis _ coming into being in this context@xcite .    in the present article",
    "we have focused our discussion in a few examples where lovelock theory has been shown to yield interesting holographic connections between the gravitational and the field theory dynamics , connections that would otherwise be impossible to uncover in the simpler setup of general relativity .",
    "many more examples exist , though , of the convenience of this extended framework for the discussion of the most diverse issues .",
    "one such example concerns the existence of an analog of zamolodchikov s @xmath105-theorem @xcite in higher dimensions , namely for 4d cfts .",
    "even though some previous indications existed @xcite , the existence of a would be monotonic quantity and how this would be related to the central charges of the theory in four dimensions , @xmath182 and @xmath105 , was not properly established . under a holographic rg flow , the existence of a monotonic quantity related to the central charge",
    "@xmath182 has been pointed out in @xcite , much earlier than the actual field theoretic proof of the so - called @xmath182-theorem was found @xcite .",
    "no monotonicity property is known for the other central charge , @xmath105 .",
    "the use of higher curvature theories is essential here as otherwise it would be impossible to identify which is the central charge with the monotonic property , given that @xmath182 and @xmath105 have the same value if gravity is governed by the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "another important issue that is receiving a lot of attention lately is that of entanglement entropy . the ryu - takayanagi proposal @xcite for the holographic computation of this important quantity amounts to the determination of a minimal surface enclosing the region of interest at the boundary , the entanglement entropy being simply proportional to the area of such surface .",
    "this conjecture has recently been accounted for in @xcite .",
    "the nave generalization of this prescription to higher curvature gravities would be that the entropy is given by the wald formula , but this has been argued to be wrong @xcite . a more educated guess would be to consider the wald - iyer formula @xcite , that reduces to the modified proposal in @xcite for lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "the checks performed in order to find the discrepancies involve certain specific contributions to the entanglement entropy that are completely governed by the conformal anomaly .",
    "depending on the shape of the region of interest , those contributions have to be proportional to a different combination of the central charges of the theory .",
    "the wald proposal , instead , yields the same combination of central charges independently of the shape .",
    "in the case of einstein - hilbert gravity we have just one independent combination of the central charges , and this is the reason behind the fact that the simplified area prescription works .    another obvious field where higher curvature gravity theories have shown their value and utility",
    "is that of the fluid / gravity correspondence ( see , for instance , @xcite for a review of one possible approach ) . in this framework , similarly to the cft case , lovelock gravities allow for the description of relativistc fluid duals with more general transport coefficients than those resulting from the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "the most celebrated example is that of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio , @xmath261 ( see @xcite for a recent review , and references therein ) . in the context of higher curvature gravity theories ,",
    "this specific transport coefficient has been considered in many papers ( see @xcite for some relevant examples ) .",
    "higher curvature theories , lovelock in particular , have been used to disprove the longstanding kss viscosity bound conjecture @xcite .",
    "the value of the shear viscosity to entropy density in general lovelock theories has been established in @xcite , where it was proven that the only lovelock coefficient affecting the actual value of @xmath261 is the lgb one ; any positive value of @xmath262 translating into a violation of the viscosity bound .",
    "the causality / positivity constraints discussed in the core of this paper have been argued to impose a new bound for any lovelock theory in any number of space - time dimensions , even though also stability constraints have to be considered to avoid negative values of @xmath263 in general @xcite . in spite of the fact that higher order lovelock terms do not enter the holographic formula of the shear viscosity , they do change the actual value of the bound .",
    "a way of lifting the causality constraints on @xmath261 has been proposed in @xcite , but stability still implies the existence of a finite bound .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that higher curvature corrections that are not of the lovelock type are also relevant in this discussion as , for instance , in the case of quasi topological gravity where @xmath264 and the bound can be slightly lowered @xcite . in this respect , the lovelock setup shall be viewed as an exploratory playground where computations are under better control due to the second order nature of its equations of motion .",
    "another possible connection between lovelock theory and the fluid / gravity correspondence may have to do with the realization in @xcite that the existence of a positive divergence entropy current in an arbitrary curved background and the onsager principle put severe constraints in the terms appearing at first order in the hydrodynamics derivative expansion .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether similar constraints appear in gravity , restricting the space of allowed higher derivative corrections to einstein s equations @xcite",
    ". this may be particularly relevant for those cases in which the entropy production vanishes in einstein gravity , and one might have to go to the next correction to realize which is the sign of the divergence of the entropy current .",
    "surely many more applications of lovelock theory in the framework of the ads / cft correspondence were left into the ink pot .",
    "it is a lively subject in which we expect to see further progress happening soon .",
    "we wish to thank alex buchel , gastn giribet , andy gomberoff , diego hofman , manuela kulaxizi , juan maldacena , rob myers , miguel paulos and sasha zhiboedov for discussions on these subjects held over the last few years .",
