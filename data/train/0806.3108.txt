    "though the cosmological measurements @xcite show that there must be approximately five times as much dark matter as all baryon one , its physical nature remains unknown .",
    "now the most commonly used hypothesis is that it consists of some elementary particles generated in the early universe ( hereafter we will call them dark matter particles , dmps ) .",
    "these particles are uncharged and do not interact strongly ; there are telling arguments to believe that they were cold ( @xmath3 ) in the epoch when the relic radiation was generated .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a particle with suitable properties hasnt been discovered yet , in spite of no lack of theoretical candidates predicted by various quantum field theory models .",
    "if the premise is true , the dark matter is a mixture of equal quantities of particles and antiparticles , and they must collide and annihilate wherever the dark matter is present .",
    "experimental observation of such a process would give us some valuable information about the dmp nature . in this article , we consider the dark matter annihilation in the epoch near the relic radiation formation ( @xmath4 ) . at that time , the average dark matter particle concentration @xmath5 was nine orders higher than now and four orders higher than in our galaxy near the sun system .",
    "so we may expect that the annihilation , the rate of which is proportional to @xmath1 , was very intensive in that epoch .",
    "of all the particles that can be generated by the dark matter annihilation we will consider only photons , as they are both uncharged and easily detectable .",
    "uncharged particles do not interact with the magnetic field of the galaxy , which allows one to measure the extragalactic background reliably enough .",
    "the earlier the universe was , the higher the dm density and the annihilation rate were .",
    "however , the emission from the very early universe can not reach us because of the opacity .",
    "the main part of the signal was generated at the moment the universe had just become transparent for the photons produced by the annihilation .",
    "later the dark matter density rapidly dropped , decreasing the signal .",
    "the moment ( and its redshift ) depends , of course , on the characteristic energy of the photons , in other words , on the nature of the dark matter .",
    "thus , the dm annihilation in the early universe should have produced a sort of relic emission .",
    "we obtain its flux and the spectrum . on the one hand ,",
    "such an emission can be detected in the spectrum of the extragalactic background . a distinguishing feature of this radiation should be its high isotropy . on the other hand , the absence of such a signal can impose a severe limitation on a dark matter model .    in calculations",
    "we assume that the dark matter is homogeneous .",
    "this is the simplest , but by no means the most natural supposition .",
    "possible amplitude of the dark matter density perturbations and their influence on the annihilation signal will be discussed at the end of the article .    in the second part of the article , the case of the most popular dark matter candidate - weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) -",
    "is considered in more detail .",
    "we demonstrate that the relic signal from the wimps annihilation might have been already observed .",
    "the metric of a homogeneous isotropic universe can be represented as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an element of three - dimensional length @xcite . in agreement with the observations @xcite we assume zero three - dimensional curvature of our universe .",
    "we introduce polar coordinates with the centre at the local observer .",
    "then the metric can be written as : @xmath8 \\label{a1}\\ ] ] we choose the normalization of @xmath9 so that the contemporary value @xmath10 ( hereafter the subscript @xmath11 is used to describe the present - day values of quantities ) .",
    "then @xmath12 and @xmath9 are related by the following equation : @xmath13 the number of annihilations in the volume @xmath14 in an interval of the proper time @xmath15 is ( we should remind once again that we consider a homogeneous dark matter distribution ) @xmath16 here the multiplier @xmath17 takes into account that the annihilation is only possible if a particle collides with an antiparticle instead of @xmath17 ] .    here",
    "we should make two temporary simplifying suppositions : we assume that one act of annihilation produces one photon of fixed energy @xmath19 and that the universe is transparent for the photons ( later we will generalize the result taking into account opacity and arbitrary spectrum of the emitting photons ) .",
    "let us consider a three - dimensional space element that is part of a spherical layer @xmath20 $ ] viewed by the local observer from a solid angle @xmath21 .",
    "if the effective area of the detector is @xmath22 , the number of photons arriving at it in an interval of time @xmath23 is : @xmath24 photons emitted with the fixed energy @xmath19 arrive at the observer with a smaller energy @xmath25 in consequence of the redshift ; @xmath19 and @xmath25 are related by the usual law @xmath26 where @xmath9 corresponds to the moment of emission . the bigger @xmath27 is , the smaller @xmath9 was . in order to find the relationship between them , we should write the equation of motion of a photon , that is @xmath28 . from ( [ a1 ] )",
    "we obtain for the radial motion @xmath29 ; whence it follows : @xmath30 the expansion of the universe after the radiation - dominated epoch can be described as @xcite : @xmath31 as we will see , the main part of emission appears when @xmath32 , and we may neglect @xmath33 in this formula .",
    "thus , @xmath34 substituting ( [ a9 ] ) and ( [ a11 ] ) into ( [ a7 ] ) we get : @xmath35 or , if we replace @xmath9 with @xmath36 , in accordance with ( [ a8 ] ) , @xmath37 so we obtain the sought - for spectral intensity @xmath38 of the photon flux , i.e. , the number of photons that come to the local observer from unit solid angle per unit time per unit of area per unit energy interval is : @xmath39 one can see that the integral of this equation over the energy diverges when @xmath40 . of course , to accomplish this , arbitrary early universe should be transparent for the photons , which is not the case .",
    "the photons interact with the baryonic matter ; let us assume that this process can be characterized by some averaged cross - section @xmath41 .",
    "then the number of interactions of the primary photons per an element of physical length @xmath42 is @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the baryon concentration @xmath45 ; we also used ( [ a9 ] ) .",
    "in order to integrate this equation , we suppose that @xmath41 is constant . this assumption is usually not very rigorous .",
    "actually , it means that we neglect the cross - section dependence on the photon energy ( which strongly changes during its propagation via the redshift ) and possible phase transitions in the universe .",
    "however , since the baryon concentration @xmath44 rapidly decreases with the universe expansion , only the moments just after the emission contribute noticeably to the opacity .",
    "so for the constant cross - section approximation to be feasible we need only that the dependence of the cross - section on the energy is not very abrupt , which is usually the case .",
    "the only phase transition which occurs in the universe near @xmath4 is recombination .",
    "it changes drastically the cross - section of photons with an energy @xmath46  ev , the approximation @xmath47 is obviously wrong in this case .",
    "however , the energy of photons generated by the dark matter annihilation is most likely considerably higher , and the recombination does not affect much their cross - section .    here",
    "we also suppose that the photon interaction with the baryonic matter is pure absorption and interacting photons just disappear .",
    "this assumption is more rough : the contribution of scattering can be significant ( see @xcite for details ) , and we underestimate the soft part of the spectrum .",
    "however , the main characteristics of the spectrum ( the characteristic energy and the intensity ) are determined by the moment the universe becomes transparent for the photons produced by the annihilation , and this moment does not depend much on whether it is absorption or scattering .",
    "consequently , the assumption is quite acceptable for an estimation model .",
    "below we will improve it .",
    "moreover , we introduce a new variable @xmath48 for the scaling factor of the universe .",
    "it has exactly the same meaning as @xmath9 , but @xmath9 represents the scaling factor at the moment when the photon is emitted , while @xmath48 represents the scaling factor changing during the photon propagation to the observer .",
    "consequently , @xmath48 changes from @xmath9 to @xmath49 . then ( [ a15 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath50 we used ( [ a10 ] ) to obtain it .",
    "since the right part of this equation rapidly drops with @xmath48 growing , we can simplify it : @xmath51    now equation ( [ a15 ] ) can be easily integrated .",
    "@xmath52 it is convenient to introduce a new constant @xmath53 from ( [ a16 ] ) we obtain : @xmath54 as it has been already mentioned , @xmath48 changes from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath55 , we may omit the last term of ( [ a17 ] ) . replacing @xmath9 with @xmath36 according to ( [ a8 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath56 in order to allow for the opacity of the early universe , we should multiply equation ( [ a14 ] ) by this exponential factor .",
    "finally , we obtain : @xmath57 since we supposed that one act of annihilation produces one photon of fixed energy @xmath19 , this equation actually specifies only a green s function .",
    "if the produced photons have some distribution @xmath58 , we should convolute @xmath59 , defined by ( [ a20 ] ) , with the distribution @xmath60 to obtain the spectrum that appears to the viewer : @xmath61 nevertheless , the spectrum given by ( [ a20 ] ) is fairly wide , and provided that the distribution @xmath62 is not too broad the shape of the resulting spectrum remains similar to ( [ a20 ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ a20 ] ) , ( [ a21 ] ) are applicable in quite general cases , but they were obtained on a rather rough assumption that the photon interaction with the baryonic matter is pure absorption . in order to make the model more realistic , we should consider a certain dmp candidate . if we make a very natural supposition that the dmps were in thermal equilibrium with other particles in the early universe , we can estimate their annihilation cross section @xcite : @xmath63 for the present value @xcite of @xmath64 we obtain @xmath65 , i.e. , a cross section typical for weak interactions .",
    "besides , the dmp must be massive for the dark matter to be cold in the epoch when the relic radiation was generated .",
    "these are the telling reasons to believe that the dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "they are expected to annihilate into fermion - antifermion or gauge boson pairs with a large fraction of quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "a wimp pair annihilation finally leads to @xmath66 photons generation ( in the fragmentation process , mainly from @xmath67 decays )",
    ". a greater part of the photons has energy in the range from 2 to 4  gev @xcite .    photon propagation at cosmological redshifts was extensively investigated in @xcite . for the photons of energy 2 - 4  gev",
    "the main channel of interaction with the baryonic matter is pair production on atoms and ionized matter ( @xmath68 ) . as we shall see below",
    ", the universe becomes transparent to 2 - 4  gev photons remarkably after the recombination .",
    "the pair production cross - section per one baryon averaged over the chemical composition ( mass fraction of hydrogen and helium are 75% and 25% , respectively ) is @xmath69 here @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "as we can see , the cross - section depends only slightly on the energy of photon .",
    "@xmath72 if @xmath73 . now we should substitute the obtained numerical values for @xmath74 and @xmath41 into ( [ a20 ] ) , but before we can improve the model . to do this",
    ", we roughly estimate the number and the energy of photons generated by the process @xmath75 .",
    "it produces one electron and one positron : each of them carries away approximately half of the energy of the primary photon .",
    "subsequently , the positron annihilates with an electron generating two photons . hence , their energy is , on average , a quarter of the primary one .",
    "of course , these photons should have rather a wide distribution but we neglect it and think of that one primary photon of energy @xmath25 produces two secondary photons of energy @xmath76 . since the cross - section ( [ a23 ] ) only slightly depends on the photon energy , we suppose that a secondary photon interacts with the matter with the same cross - section @xmath41 as the primary one .",
    "we consider the secondary photon scattering as pure absorption . indeed , the photons generated by them via the pair production have energies @xmath77  mev . in this energy range",
    "the compton scattering becomes the main process of interaction @xcite .",
    "its cross - section rapidly grows with the photon energy decreasing , and low - energy photons are scattered time and again , quickly loosing the energy .",
    "thus , a scattering of a photon of energy @xmath78  mev is actually equivalent to its absorption .",
    "the number of the secondary photons is symbolized by @xmath79 . in order to obtain a differential equation describing their propagation we can use the same procedure as in ( [ b2]-[a20 ] ) .",
    "the relationship ( [ b3 ] ) acquires the form @xmath80 the second term here describes the secondary photon absorption by the substance , the first one represents their production via the above - mentioned mechanism ( the multiplier @xmath81 takes into account that one act of a primary photon absorption produces two secondary photons ) .",
    "the number of primary photons @xmath82 is given by ( [ a17 ] ) . as the boundary condition we should use the fact that there were no secondary photons when the primary had been just generated @xmath83 the solution of ( [ a24 ] ) satisfying the conditions is @xmath84 in order to calculate the value for the observer we should substitute @xmath85 . since @xmath86 @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the initial number of primary photons . as in the case of the derivation of equation ( [ a20 ] ) ,",
    "we substitute ( [ a12 ] ) for @xmath88 @xmath89 we suppose that the energy of a secondary photon is a quarter of the energy of the primary one . to account for this effect , @xmath90 should be substituted for @xmath9 instead of ( [ a8 ] ) .",
    "finally , we obtain for the flux @xmath91 of secondary photons : @xmath92 the total signal is the sum @xmath93 . if the annihilation generates photons with some distribution @xmath60 ( one act of annihilation produces @xmath58 photons in the energy interval @xmath94 ) , we should convolute the sum with the distribution , by analogy with ( [ a21 ] ) : @xmath95    figure  [ fig1 ] ( taken from @xcite ) represents the photon spectra caused by various wimps annihilation channels . in the interval @xmath96",
    "gev the upper curve ( which describes the main @xmath97 channel ) is well approximated if the distribution function @xmath98 .",
    "we shall use the following @xmath60 ( @xmath19 is expressed in gevs ) : @xmath99 we normalized it considering that one act of annihilation generated on average 30 photons .    strictly speaking ,",
    "the annihilation cross - section and the relative contribution of various channels depend on the energy of the dmps collision , which can be important , if the annihilation occurs , for instance , near a black hole @xcite",
    ". however , in the considered case the relative velocity of the dmps is very small , and we may neglect this effect .",
    "in order to fulfil the calculations , the cosmological parameters should be concretized .",
    "we use the following set ( see @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ( of course , @xmath103 ) , the hubble constant @xmath104 , the relic radiation temperature @xmath105  k , the baryon - photon ratio @xmath106 . we obtain the present baryon concentration @xmath107 . the dmp concentration , with dmp mass taken as @xmath108  gev , is @xmath109 .",
    "equation ( [ a22 ] ) gives @xmath110 .",
    "the influence of the relic annihilation on the ionization history of the universe is negligible .",
    "indeed , for the recombination epoch ( @xmath111 ) we have : @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "the number of annihilations in a unit volume per unit time is @xmath114 . in the characteristic time",
    "( of the order of the hydrogen ion recombination time at that epoch 435  years  @xmath115  s @xcite ) we have @xmath116 annihilations that produce @xmath117  ev of energy .",
    "a hydrogen atom ionization requires @xmath118  ev .",
    "so , even all the energy produced by the annihilation is enough to ionize only @xmath119  % of atoms .",
    "we take @xmath120 ( [ a23 ] ) .",
    "then the constant @xmath121 is equal to @xmath122 .    the resulting spectrum of the relic gamma - ray background , obtained with the aid of ( [ a30 ] ) , ( [ a31 ] ) , ( [ a20 ] ) , and ( [ a29 ] ) , is represented in figure  [ fig2 ] . instead of the photon flux @xmath123",
    "we have plotted the quantity @xmath124 ( that is @xmath125 ) , which is traditionally used in experimental data picturing .",
    "the primary ( [ a20 ] ) and the secondary ( [ a29 ] ) photon separate contributions are represented by the dashed and the dotted lines , respectively .",
    "the contribution of secondary photons is small in these coordinates , even though their total number is very large .",
    "our main conclusions are that the spectrum grows up to @xmath126  mev , and the bulk of the signal lies in the range from 0.5 to 20  mev .",
    "characteristic redshift of the relic gamma - rays can be easily calculated . according to ( [ a20 ] )",
    ", the quantity @xmath125 has its maximum at @xmath127 . according to ( [ b1 ] )",
    ", it corresponds to @xmath2 .",
    "the cosmic gamma - ray background reportedly ( see , for instance , @xcite ) has a peculiarity in the energy range 0.5 - 20  mev .",
    "a ledge - like feature is visible in the extragalactic gamma - ray spectrum ( fig .  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the photon index here is markedly distinct from those of the softer or harder parts of the spectrum @xcite , indicating its different origin .",
    "moreover , this spectral band can be formed neither by too soft emission of normal active galactic nuclei , nor by too hard blazar - type agns contribution ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "attempts to consider the nuclear - decay gamma rays from type ia supernovae as the source have not been successful : the flux expected from the supernovae is several times weaker than the observed @xcite .",
    "it might be well to point out that the precise determination of the excess boundaries and intensity is model - dependent , and the literature values vary considerably @xcite . in any case , however , the excess becomes apparent near 0.5  mev and disappears at the energies @xmath128  20  mev .",
    "one can see that the energy range of the feature corresponds closely to the interval characteristic for the relic gamma emission from the wimps annihilation .",
    "this coincidence looks promising when it is considered that the wimp is now one of the most probable dark matter candidates .    at the same time , the relic gamma emission predicted by equations ( [ a30 ] ) , ( [ a31 ] ) , ( [ a20 ] ) , and ( [ a29 ] ) , is approximately five orders fainter than the observed feature ( as we can see in figure  [ fig2 ] , the relic emission near the maximum at 10  mev has @xmath129 while the total extragalactic gamma - ray background at 10  mev has @xmath130 @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy might result from inapplicability of the assumption of homogeneous dark matter distribution .",
    "in fact it can not be so .",
    "the modern structure of the universe appeared from some initial perturbations that had already existed , beyond any doubt , in the epoch @xmath131 . according to wmap measurements @xcite ,",
    "in the recombination epoch @xmath132 relative variations of the baryonic matter density were of the order of @xmath133 .",
    "dark matter perturbations could be much more intensive , they were not suppressed by the radiation pressure in the pre - recombination epoch . moreover , they must have been significantly stronger ( not less than @xmath134 ) to explain the modern universe structure @xcite .",
    "since the recombination happened in the matter - dominated epoch , the perturbations rapidly grew and at the moment @xmath135 could attain very big amplitude .",
    "the presence of density inhomogeneities does not affect the spectrum of the annihilation signal but increases its intensity .",
    "this effect is usually described by the quantity @xmath136 that appears as a multiplier in the expression for the intensity ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "of course , @xmath137 is a function of @xmath12 .",
    "this brings up two points : first , is it possible that the structure growth in the early universe proceeded so fast that @xmath137 was as large as @xmath138 by the moment @xmath139 ?",
    "second , if an intensive structure formation took place at some moment @xmath140 , the coefficient @xmath141 could grow so rapidly that it far outweighed the signal diminution owing to average density decrease . as a result a hard tail or even a secondary hard maximum on the energy ( 2 - 4)/@xmath142  gev can appear in the spectrum of the relic emission , which is not observed . unfortunately , the theory of evolution of dark matter perturbations is still far from accurate .",
    "they evolved from some primordial fluctuations existed in the very early universe . while the universe was radiation - dominated their growth was slow .",
    "the smallest perturbations were destroyed by free - streaming ( for the instance of neutralinos of the mass @xmath77  gev this limit is estimated as @xmath143 @xcite ) .",
    "when the universe transits into the matter - dominated stage , the perturbations start to grow rapidly , and eventually they become nonlinear and collapse . as this takes place ,",
    "the smallest clumps collapse the first ( at a time we denote as @xmath144 ) @xcite .",
    "the overwhelming majority of these small clumps originated at that moment were subsequently destroyed by tidal interaction with larger clumps originated later .",
    "but up to now it is the small clumps formed at the epoch @xmath144 that makes the main contribution to the annihilation rate of the dark matter since they are the densest @xcite . at the moment",
    "@xmath144 function @xmath141 underwent a rapid increase from a value close to @xmath145 to a very big value . in",
    "what follows creation of the larger structures was accompanied by smaller clump destruction , and @xmath141 changes more smoothly . in order to be allowed to suggest that the extragalactic gamma - ray 0.5 - 20  mev excess is related to the neutralino annihilation we must assume that @xmath146 , i.e. the first structures started to form before the universe became transparent for the photons produced by the annihilation .",
    "how realistic is such an assumption ?",
    "unfortunately , present estimations are very vague .",
    "even the minimal possible clump mass for the neutralino dark matter is determined extremely uncertainly ( from @xmath147 @xcite to @xmath148 @xcite , to say nothing of the clumps density profile and the moment when the fluctuations become nonlinear .",
    "experimental data as well as numerical simulations essentially cover the range of very large structures @xmath149 ( for instance , wmap can observe only the biggest perturbations with masses corresponding to a cluster of galaxies @xmath150 @xcite ) .",
    "properties of smaller clumps are usually obtained by approximation @xcite . however , in order to obtain any parameters for the tiny clumps of mass @xmath151 one has to extend the results by @xmath152-@xmath153 orders .",
    "another source of uncertainties is the spectrum of primordial fluctuations .",
    "usually it is deemed that it has flat harrison - zeldovich shape . in this case",
    "the moment of the first intensive clump creation is estimated as @xmath154 , though some individual clumps collapsed much earlier @xcite . if such a scenario was indeed realized , the interpretation of 0.5 - 20  mev excess as a result of neutralino annihilation is out of the question : otherwise a strong maximum at the energy 4/@xmath144  gev  @xmath155  50  mev would appear ( which contradicts to the observations ) .",
    "on the other hand , let us suppose that the spectrum of primordial fluctuations is not exactly flat , and the intensity of the fluctuations slightly builds up as their scale decreases . in the matter - dominated stage the perturbations grow as @xmath156 and @xmath157 , therefore @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the small - scale perturbations left the radiation - dominated stage with amplitudes more than expected from the harrison - zeldovich spectrum , they collapsed earlier ( in so doing we imply that the amplitudes of large - scale perturbations are fixed in such a way as they reproduce the observed large - scale structure of the universe ) .",
    "considering that the largest and the smallest clump mass scales differ by more than @xmath159 orders , even a small tilt of the spectrum of primordial fluctuations with respect to the harrison - zeldovich shape can be sufficient .",
    "a kindred scenario was considered , for instance , by @xcite . in the context of the model examined by the authors",
    "small clumps are extremely dense and collapse just after the universe transition to the matter - dominated epoch ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "it is worthy of note that the situation when @xmath161 can appear in much softer scenarios than those similar to @xcite .",
    "let us give a more specific form to the above reasoning .",
    "the spectrum of primordial fluctuations is usually considered to have a power - law shape : @xmath162 the case when @xmath163 corresponds to the harrison - zeldovich spectrum .",
    "the moment when a perturbation mode becomes nonlinear and collapses is determined by the spectrum function @xcite @xmath164 ( in @xcite @xmath165 is symbolized by @xmath166 ) .",
    "for all the perturbations we consider @xmath167 , and @xmath168 the moment @xmath169 when clumps collapse is @xmath170 which correlates with the results of @xcite . in the case of harrison - zeldovich spectrum @xmath165 is flat ; the structures of various scales appear almost simultaneously and have similar densities .",
    "if @xmath171 , smaller clumps appear much earlier and have much higher density ( since the universe density is much higher at the moment they collapse ) .",
    "we can now construct a toy model of structure formation with the help of an approach used in @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath172 , i.e. @xmath173 , and the minimal possible clump mass @xmath174 .",
    "since the clamp mass relating to a perturbation mode is proportional to @xmath175 , we obtain from ( [ c4 ] ) : @xmath176 here we have introduced the maximum perturbation mass @xmath177 that collapses at @xmath178 .",
    "this equation is consistent with @xcite , where it was accepted @xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "then the first clumps in our model appear at @xmath181 , i.e @xmath182 . we can rewrite ( [ c4 ] ) as @xmath183 in accordance with @xcite we can represent the boost factor @xmath141 as a product of three multipliers : @xmath184\\ ] ] ( see all the details of the model and the notation in @xcite ) . for a flat @xmath185cdm universe",

    ".    the matter fraction collapsed into cosmological halos is : @xmath190 hereafter @xmath191 is the maximum having collapsed at given @xmath12 .",
    "theoretical model @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite give for the differential number density of clumps in the comoving frame of reference @xmath192 . substituting it in ( [ c6 ] ) and using ( [ c8 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath193 where @xmath194 .",
    "we will adopt the value obtained by @xcite @xmath195 .",
    "the factor @xmath196=\\int c^{halo } m \\frac{dn}{dm } dm/ \\int dm \\frac{dn}{dm}m$ ] represents the `` halo clumping '' .",
    "if we adopt the navarro - frenk - white clump profile than @xmath197 in order to describe the halo concentration parameter @xmath198 evolution we will use an equation from @xcite with @xmath199 , @xmath200 @xmath201 this formula was obtained as a fit of n - body simulations and is valid only for a limited range of @xmath202 and @xmath12 covered by them .",
    "we have to consider a much wider mass and red shift range , and ( [ c10 ] ) gives too large @xmath198 for the smallest clumps ( for instance , for the minimal mass clumps at the present epoch @xmath203 ) .",
    "such a huge value seems unlikely and indicates that equation ( [ c10 ] ) should be corrected .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that for any chosen clump mass the concentration parameter rises only up to @xmath204 , and after remains constant .",
    "now the toy model is defined .",
    "the boost factor @xmath141 evolution curve predicted by it is represented in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we can make two principal conclusions .",
    "first of all , @xmath205 and @xmath206 in the model considered , i.e. the first structures appear very early ( @xmath207 ) , and at the moment @xmath139 the boost factor is large enough to explain the discrepancy between the observed and the predicted signal intensities .",
    "second , the boost factor @xmath141 grows respectively slowly after @xmath139 . from the moment when the universe became transparent for the annihilation photons up to the present moment it increases only on an order , while the signal without regard for the clumpiness rapidly falls as @xmath208 owing to the dark matter density decrease ( [ a12 ] ) .",
    "it means that almost all the signal appears at the moment @xmath209 and the resulting spectrum has neither a hard tail nor a secondary harder maximum . in closing",
    "we remark that the foregoing structure formation scheme is no more than a toy model presented here only to illustrate that the structures in the universe could appear early , and the interpretation of the excess as a result of wimp annihilation is principally possible .",
    "the dark matter annihilation has already been invoked to explain the 0.5 - 20  mev excess @xcite .",
    "since the photon spectrum is relatively soft , the authors introduced a low - mass dark matter candidate ( @xmath210  mev ) .",
    "its annihilation cross - section is sizable to provide the observed signal @xmath211 @xcite that is at least no less than the typical weak interaction cross - section at this energy scale .",
    "such a low - mass dark matter candidate with such a significant cross - section is now ruled out ( by the accelerator experiments ) in ordinary schemes like mssm , but there is an interesting possibility to introduce it in more sophisticated scenarios @xcite .    in our case",
    ", we can manage with usual heavy wimp candidates .",
    "as we could see , the relic gamma - ray signal redshift is @xmath131 .",
    "originally , the photons had the energy @xmath212  gev and they were produced by the annihilation of ordinary wimp particles like the lightest neutralinos .",
    "on the other hand , if our interpretation is true , it counts in favour of a relatively light wimp ( @xmath213  gev ) .",
    "if @xmath214  gev , the typical energy of the producing photons is higher , and the feature in the spectrum must be harder than the observed one .",
    "thus , the critical point for the 0.5 - 20  mev excess interpretation as a result of relic neutralino annihilation is determination of the moment @xmath142 when the first structures in the universe appeared .",
    "if the structures had appeared before the universe became transparent for the annihilation products ( i.e. @xmath146 ) , then there are strong arguments to believe that the excess 0.5 - 20  mev is created by the relic wimps annihilation .",
    "above all , the characteristic energies of the spectra agree . besides , the wimp is now one of the most probable dark matter candidates , and the coincidence does not look random .",
    "the discrepancy of the predicted and observed signal intensities can be naturally explained by the nonuniform structure of the dark matter .",
    "if the first clumps appeared later ( @xmath140 ) , the excess undoubtedly could not be produced by neutralino annihilation .",
    "further progress in the universe structure formation understanding will be able to shed light on this problem .",
