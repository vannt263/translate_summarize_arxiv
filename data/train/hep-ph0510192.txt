    "the main objects of our studies are correlators of charged hadron currents with the value of isospin @xmath1 @xmath2 for vector and axial channels , i.  e. for @xmath3    these objects play important role in qcd , since they contain information of two kinds : one is the spectral features of hadrons   the set of the mass poles @xmath4 and the corresponding quark coupling constants @xmath5 , which define behavior of the correlators for large @xmath6 , on the other hand , at small distances , where perturbation theory works , and ope is assumed to be valid , the coefficients of the correlation functions expansion give us matrix elements of local field operators   the vacuum condensates like @xmath7 .",
    "current correlators were studied long ago in the framework of perturbation theory , which works at small @xmath6 because of asymptotic freedom of qcd @xcite .",
    "power corrections to this behavior , expressed in terms of gluon and quark condensates , were found with the help of ope , which is consistent also only for small enough distances @xcite .",
    "there are many papers , where calculations of ( [ correlator ] ) are given on the base of different approaches .",
    "so , the random instanton liquid model , where it is supposed , that the nonperturbative qcd - vacuum is dominated by strong classical field configuration   instantons , whose position and color orientations are distributed randomly ,   gives good result for the difference of the correlation functions in all region of distances ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "correlation functions and their moments in momentum space are considered in some papers with the purpose of extraction from them the values of the lowest ope condensates @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there is another model   the so - called minimal hadronic ansatz ( mha ) , in which the spectral density consists of the pion state , a vector state and an axial state plus continuum . in this this approximation",
    "one can compute corresponding condensates @xcite or compare the moments of the polarization operators with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the method of calculation of correlators , more general , than mha , was proposed in the paper @xcite .",
    "this method , as well as mha , assumes the limit of large number of colors @xmath9 , when the hadronic spectrum is represented by the set of zero - width levels .",
    "one can calculate the spectrum quasiclassically @xcite , restore the correlator in momentum space by this spectrum and by residues and then go to coordinate space . in the same paper was made the comparison of obtained expressions for the correlators with the lattice data @xcite and @xcite and good agreement of the results was found .",
    "this paper continues the line of research , started in @xcite .",
    "we will be interested in explicit expressions for current correlators ( [ correlator ] ) in the model with equidistant spectrum , and the main purpose is to compare these expressions with the real experimental data of aleph collaboration @xcite on hadronic @xmath0-decay .",
    "note also , that the model of zero - width equidistant resonances has been considered with respect to correlation function in @xcite , @xcite , where the main attention was spared to the momentum - space representation and the corresponding ope coefficients were estimated .",
    "we will be interested in the current correlators , calculated in the euclidean coordinate space and compare them directly with the experimental curves .",
    "we work with qcd in the limit of large number of colors @xmath9 . in the framework of this limit",
    "the hadronic spectrum is a set of zero - width resonances .",
    "masses @xmath10 and residues @xmath5 of current correlators are stable at large @xmath9 limit and define the imaginary part of the polarization operators ( see appendix ) : @xmath11    on the other hand , one can obtain the equidistant mass spectrum and the set of residues in analytic form for all @xmath12 quasiclassically , solving the corresponding hamiltonian problem for two quarks @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the masses of low lying resonances in each channel , and the quantity @xmath15 is defined universally for all channels , where @xmath16 is physical string tension .    in that way one can easily find with the help of ( [ im->m_n , c_n ] ) the correlation function in the momentum space and",
    "then go to the coordinate one ( see appendix ) .",
    "it is convenient to consider the normalized correlation functions and to define the ratio @xmath17 as @xmath18 where @xmath19    experimental data provide us with information about the spectral functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the interval @xmath22 : @xmath23 i.  e. about the imaginary parts of polarization operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 , defining the correlation functions in momentum space ( [ p_v(q ) ] ) and ( [ p_a(q ) ] ) .    using the dispersion relation @xmath26 and the known representation for the mcdonald function @xmath27 for @xmath28 ,",
    "it is easy to obtain the spectral representation for correlation functions in coordinate space : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a distance in euclidean space , @xmath31 are corresponding spectral functions , and @xmath32    one should take care of the term @xmath33 from ( [ p_a(q ) ] ) , which corresponds to the contribution of the pion state .",
    "it is taken into account by adding to @xmath34 the term ( see , e.  g. @xcite ) @xmath35    the integrals in considered combinations @xmath36 where @xmath37 , were taken numerically by simpson method , using the experimental data for difference and sum of the spectral functions in the region @xmath38 .",
    "the spectral functions @xmath39 were replaced by the parton model prediction for @xmath40 , i.  e. @xmath41 for @xmath40 . under this replacement we do not take into account perturbation theory corrections , which change little behavior of the sum of the current correlators for small @xmath6 . however , this perturbative corrections , corresponding to the hybrid states in the spectral sum in terms of our model , are not taken into account also , so the disregarding of them in the experimental curves is coordinated with the model calculations .",
    "the experimental curves , normalized to the free answer ( [ p_free ] ) , and the corresponding model predictions are shown on the fig .",
    "[ result1 ] for two values of the cut - off scale @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "notice , that the choice of the cut - off parameter @xmath44 changes noticeably behavior of @xmath45 only in the intermediate region of @xmath6 , pushing away the theoretical curve from the experimental one .",
    "in addition , the error bars increase with increasing @xmath44 in this region because of large uncertainties of the experimental data for @xmath46 , so agreement of the experimental curves with the model predictions remains acceptable even on the quantitative level .",
    "on the other hand , using meson masses and decay constants as fitting parameters , one can place the curves , obtained in the framework of the model at large @xmath9 , inside the error corridors completely ( see fig .",
    "[ result2 ] ) . the corresponding values",
    "@xmath47 reproduce the table values ( 21 ) with @xmath48 accuracy .",
    "the errors was computed with the help of experimental covariance matrices @xmath49 by the standard expression @xmath50^{1/2 } = \\left [ \\int\\limits_0^{s_0 } ds \\int\\limits_0^{s_0 } ds ' \\ , \\rho_{v\\pm a}(s , s ' ) \\ , s\\ , d(\\sqrt s , x_e ) \\ , s ' \\ , d(\\sqrt{s'},x_e ) \\right]^{1/2}.\\ ] ]",
    "we have considered the model , based on qcd in the limit of large number of colors @xmath9 , in which the meson spectrum is taken as the series of zero - width equidistant levels .",
    "this model is surely far from the real physical world and is over simplified .",
    "however , as can be seen from the results of comparison of the calculations , performed in the framework of this model , with the high precision experimental data of aleph collaboration for the correlators of hadron currents , the knowledge of several spectral features ( in our case , these are the data about low lying resonances in corresponding channels and the correct behavior of the mass spectrum and of the set of residues for @xmath51 ) is enough to reproduce correctly on qualitative and even on quantitative level such integral objects ( in a sense of the spectral density ) as correlation functions ( [ correlator ] ) . besides , note also , that all the parameters of the model ( meson masses , decay constants , string tension ) are fixed by their physical values , and calculated correlation function have in principle a form of a fixed prediction without any fitting parameters , however , having shifted quite a little the values of this input parameters ( @xmath52 ) , one can reach a very good agreement with the experimental data .",

    "i am also thankful to the `` dynasty '' foundation for financial support .",
    "for conserved vector current one can write the following expression in momentum space : @xmath53          which are depend on the dimensionless coordinates @xmath57 , where @xmath58 are the masses of the resonances in vector ( @xmath59  -  meson ) and axial ( @xmath60  -  meson ) channels .",
