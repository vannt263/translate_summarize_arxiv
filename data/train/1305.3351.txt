    "recent investigations augur that demand for mobile broadband  driven by the large scale proliferation of wireless industry  will surpass the availability of wireless spectrum in imminent future . yet , as recent measurements suggest , the licensed bands remain largely under - utilized .",
    "a reasonable conjecture therefore is that unlicensed access of idle ( but licensed ) spectrum bands , commonly referred to as secondary spectrum access , would avert the impending crisis .",
    "recently , fcc has legalized the access of tv white space spectrum , and the advent of cognitive radios together with the design of a plethora of sophisticated algorithms have enabled intelligent selection of bands .",
    "large - scale secondary spectrum access can not however be realized only through the availability of the enabling technology and the regulatory progress : secondary access must also be rendered profitable for the license holders .",
    "accordingly , we investigate a spectrum oligopoly @xcite where license holders ( hitherto referred to as primaries ) allow unlicensed users ( hitherto referred to as secondaries ) , in lieu of financial remuneration , access to the channels ( licensed bands ) that are not in use .",
    "different channels offer different transmission rates to the secondaries depending on their states which evolve randomly and reflect the usage levels of the primaries as also transmission quality fluctuations owing to fading .",
    "each primary quotes a price for the channel that it offers and secondaries select among the available channels depending on the states and the prices quoted .",
    "thus , if a primary quotes a high price , it will earn a large profit if it sells its channel , but may not be able to sell at all ; on the other hand a low price will enhance the probability of a sale but also fetch lower profits in the event of a sale .",
    "price selection in oligopolies may be modeled as a non - cooperative game and has naturally been extensively investigated in economics , implementing _",
    "bertrand game _ @xcite and its modifications @xcite .",
    "however , all the above papers ignore the uncertainty of competition which distinguishes spectrum markets from standard oligopolies : a primary knows the state of its channel but does not know those of its competitors before deciding the price for its channel .",
    "pricing in communication services have been explored to a great extent ( @xcite prsenets a brief overview ) .",
    "references @xcite have analyzed price competition among spectrum providers .",
    "references @xcite modeled price competition among multiple players . but",
    "all the above papers suffer from drawbacks : first , they did not assay uncertainty of states of channels of competitors ; second , most of them did not explicitly determine a nash equilibrium ( ne ) ( exceptions are @xcite,@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the papers that consider uncertainty of competition , namely @xcite , assume that the commodity on sale can be in one of two states : available or otherwise .",
    "this assumption does not capture different transmission qualities offered by the available channels .",
    "the consideration of the latter significantly complicates the analysis of the game .",
    "a primary may now need to employ different pricing strategies for different states , while in the former case a single pricing strategy will suffice as a price need not be quoted for an unavailable commodity .",
    "our investigation seeks to contribute in this space .",
    "we have modeled the price selection as a game with primaries as the players ( section  [ sec : model ] ) and seek an ne pricing strategy .",
    "we consider that the preference of the secondaries can be captured by a penalty function which associates a penalty value to each channel that is available for sale depending on its state and price quoted .",
    "given the state of a channel , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the price quoted and the penalty perceived by a secondary .",
    "thus , the strategy for selection of a price for a channel in a given state may be equivalently represented as a strategy for selection of penalty that the channel offers to a secondary . since prices and therefore the penalties take real values , the strategy set of the players are continuous ; also the payoff functions for the primaries turn out to be discontinuous .",
    "thus , classical results do not guarantee the existence , let alone the uniqueness , of an ne .",
    "in addition , existing literature does not provide algorithms for computing an ne unlike when the strategy set is finite@xcite .",
    "starting from a general set of strategy profiles for the primaries which allows for selecting penalties using arbitrary probability distributions , we show that for a large class of penalty functions , there exists a unique symmetric ne strategy profile , which we explicitly compute ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "our analysis reveals several interesting insights about the structure of the symmetric ne .",
    "first , we learn that if a channel in state @xmath0 provides a higher transmission rate to a secondary than that in state @xmath1 , then the symmetric ne strategy profile selects the penalties for @xmath2 respectively from ranges @xmath3 , [ l_j , u_j]$ ] where @xmath4 thus , a secondary will always prefer a channel in state @xmath0 to a channel in state @xmath1 considering both the prices and the states .",
    "this negates the intuition that prices ought to be selected for the states so as to render them equally preferable to a secondary - symmetric ne strategy profiles in fact price the channels so as to retain the preference order provided by the states .",
    "the analysis also reveals that the unique symmetric ne strategy profile consists `` nice '' probability distributions in that they are continuous and strictly increasing ; the former rules out pure strategy symmetric nes and the latter ensures that the support sets are contiguous .",
    "finally , utilizing the explicit computation algorithm for the symmetric ne strategies , we analytically and numerically investigate the reduction in expected profit suffered under the unique symmetric ne pricing strategies as compared to the maximum possible value allowing for collusion among primaries ( section  [ numerical ] ) .",
    "_ all the proofs are deferred to the appendix_.",
    "we consider a spectrum market with @xmath5 primaries and @xmath6 secondaries",
    ". we will initially consider the case that the primaries know @xmath6 , later generalize our results for random , apriori unknown @xmath6 .",
    "each primary has access to a channel which can be in states @xmath7 , where state @xmath0 provides a lower transmission rate to a secondary than state @xmath1 if @xmath8 and state @xmath9 arises when the channel is not available for sale and provides @xmath9 transmission rate .",
    "different channels constitute disjoint frequency bands leased by the primaries .",
    "a channel is in state @xmath10 w.p .",
    "@xmath11 and in state @xmath9 w.p .",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 , independent of the states of other channels .",
    "if a primary quotes a price @xmath14 for a channel in state @xmath0 , then the channel offers a penalty @xmath15 to a secondary .",
    "each @xmath16 is continuous , strictly increasing in its argument , and therefore invertible .",
    "we denote @xmath17 as the inverse of @xmath16 ; clearly @xmath17 is continuous and strictly increasing in its argument as well .",
    "no secondary buys a channel whose penalty is higher than @xmath18 , and as the name suggests a secondary prefers a channel with a lower penalty ( a secondary s preference depends entirely on the penalty ) .",
    "thus , we must have @xmath19 and @xmath20 for each @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "each primary also incurs a transition cost @xmath23 for an available channel , and therefore never selects a price lower than @xmath24 we assume that @xmath25 a large class of penalty functions @xmath16 satisfy the above property required of the corresponding inverses , e.g. , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is continuous , strictly increasing function and @xmath28 is strictly increasing , @xmath29 for @xmath30 and a strictly increasing @xmath31 in addition , @xmath16 such that the inverses are of the form @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is continuous and strictly increasing ; @xmath28 is sirictly increasing , satisfy the above assumption .",
    "if primary @xmath0 quotes a price @xmath14 for its channel then its profit(payoff ) is + @xmath34 note that if @xmath35 is the number of channels offered for sale for which the penalties are upper bounded by @xmath18 , then those with @xmath36 lowest penalties are sold since secondaries select channels in increasing order of penalties .",
    "the ties among channels with identical penalties are broken randomly and symmetrically among the primaries .",
    "also , note that utilities of primaries are not continuous functions of their actions .",
    "each primary selects the penalty for its channel with the knowledge of the state of the channel , but without knowing the states of the other channels ; a primary however knows @xmath37 .",
    "note that the choice of the penalty uniquely determines the price since there is a one - to - one correspondence between the two given the state of a channel .",
    "primary @xmath0 chooses its penalty using an arbitrary probability distribution function ( d.f . )",
    "is the function @xmath38 @xcite]@xmath39 when its channel is in state @xmath40",
    ". if @xmath41 ( i.e. , the channel is unavailable ) , @xmath0 chooses a penalty of @xmath42 : this is equivalent to considering that such a channel is not offered for sale as no secondary buys a channel whose penalty exceeds @xmath18 . for @xmath40 ,",
    "each primary selects its price so as to maximize its expected profit .",
    "thus , if @xmath43 , primaries select the highest penalty for each state @xmath44 , since all available channels will be sold .",
