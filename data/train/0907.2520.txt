    "various proposals of diverse characters have been suggested by the physicists during the past decades for going beyond , or modifying , einstein general relativity and often for few viable reasons . the most important motivation coming from high - energy physics for adding higher order invariants to the gravitational action , as well as a general motivation coming from cosmology and astrophysics @xcite for seeking generalizations of einstein gravity .",
    "the so - called modified gravities constructed by adding correction terms to the usual einstein - hilbert action ( e.g : @xcite ) , is only one endeavor among others to go beyond einstein general relativity and have opened a new window to study the origin of the current accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "for example in lovelock gravity , there have been some attempts for understanding the role of the higher curvature terms from various points of view @xcite . as an another example , a special case of considering the effect of higher curvature corrections",
    ", we will deal with in this paper the so - called @xmath0 gravity @xcite ( and for a review , see , @xcite ) , whose action is an arbitrary function of curvature scalar @xmath2 . when @xmath3 , the einstein s general relativity is recovered .",
    "some of the main reasons to consider @xmath0 gravity are as follows : first of all , there is simplicity : @xmath0 actions are sufficiently general to encapsulate some of the basic characteristics of higher - order gravity , but at the same time they are simple enough to be easy to handle .",
    "second , there are serious reasons to believe that @xmath0 theories are unique among higher - order gravity theories , in the sense that they seem to be the only ones which can avoid the long known and fatal ostrogradski instability @xcite .",
    "third , @xmath0 theories have no ghosts @xcite , and the stability condition @xmath4 of @xcite essentially amounts to guarantee that the scalaron is not a ghost .    in @xmath0 gravity , einstein equations",
    "posses extra terms induced from geometry which , when moved to the right hand side , may be interpreted as a matter source represented by the energy - momentum tensor @xmath5 , see equation ( [ fe],[tcurv ] ) . in a similar fashion ,",
    "the space - time - matter ( @xmath6 ) theory , discussed below , results in einstein equations in @xmath7dimension with some extra matter terms showed by the energy - momentum tensor @xmath8 .",
    "it therefore seems plausible to make a correspondence between the matter terms in @xmath6 theory and geometrical terms in @xmath5 resulting in @xmath0 gravity .    from the other point of view",
    ", straightforward generalization of the electromagnetic field to higher dimensions one essential property of it is lost , namely , conformal invariance . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the conformal excitations of the extra - dimensional space components have the form of massive scalar fields living in the external ( our ) spacetime .",
    "maxwell theory can be studied in a gauge which is invariant under conformal rescalings of the metric , and firstly , has been proposed by eastwood and singer @xcite .",
    "also , there exists a conformally invariant extension of the maxwell action in higher dimensions ( generalized maxwell field , gmf ) , if one uses the lagrangian of the @xmath9 gauge field in the form @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the  maxwell tensor and @xmath12 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "it is straightforward to show that for @xmath13 , the action ( [ igmf ] ) is invariant under conformal transformation ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and for @xmath16 , the action ( [ igmf ] ) reduces to the maxwell action as it should be .",
    "the idea is to take advantage of the conformal symmetry to construct the analogues of the four - dimensional reissner - nordstrm black hole solutions in higher dimensions .",
    "the main scope of this work is to present the correspondence between @xmath0 gravity and einstein - conformally invariant maxwell theory .",
    "as we show later , these solutions have some interesting properties , specially in the electromagnetic fields , which do not occur in einstein gravity in the present of ordinary maxwell field .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section [ fieldf(r ) ] we present a short review of field equations of @xmath17-dimensional @xmath0 gravity . in section [ solf(r ) ] the field equations of @xmath1 gravity are solved in the absence of matter field and the resulting solutions are interpreted as black hole .",
    "the solutions of einstein - conformally invariant maxwell source are considered in section [ enonmax ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "the action of @xmath0 gravity , in the presence of matter field has the form of @xmath18 ,   \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the scalar curvature and @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of @xmath2 , and @xmath19 is the lagrangian of matter fields .",
    "variation with respect to metric @xmath20 , leads to the field equations @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the einstein tensor and the gravitational stress - energy tensor is @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 the standard matter stress - energy tensor derived from the matter lagrangian @xmath19 in the action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "one can consider geometrical terms in the left hand side of the field equation , and therefore eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) reduces to @xmath26 the trace of eq .",
    "( [ fieldeq1 ] ) reduces to @xmath27 here , we consider the special case of @xmath0 gravity , namely , @xmath28 gravity and therefore the field equation ( [ fieldeq1 ] ) reduces to @xmath29 r^{n-1}+n\\left [ g_{\\mu \\nu } \\box -\\nabla _ { \\mu } \\nabla _ { \\nu } \\right ] r^{n-1}=\\mathrm{t}_{\\mu \\nu } ^{matt }   \\label{fieldeq2}\\ ] ] it is easy to show that for @xmath30 , eq . ( [ fieldeq2 ] ) reduces to familiar einstein gravity .",
    "here we want to obtain the @xmath17-dimensional static solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ fieldeq2 ] ) without any matter field ( @xmath31 , and then @xmath32 ) with @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that the metric has the following form @xmath34 where @xmath35 which represents the line element of an @xmath36-dimensional hypersurface with constant curvature @xmath37 and volume @xmath38 . to find the function @xmath39",
    ", one may use any components of eq .",
    "( [ fieldeq2 ] ) .",
    "the solution which satisfies all the components of the gravitational field equations ( [ fieldeq2 ] ) , can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are integration constants which proportional to the mass and charge parameter respectively . in order to study the general structure of this solution",
    ", we first look for the curvature singularities .",
    "it is easy to show that the kretschmann scalar @xmath43 diverges at @xmath44 , it is finite for @xmath45 and goes to zero as @xmath46 .",
    "thus , there is an essential singularity located at @xmath44 .",
    "the event horizon(s ) , if there exists any , is ( are ) located at the root(s ) of @xmath47 @xmath48    the temperature may be obtained through the use of the definition of surface gravity .",
    "one obtains @xmath49 using the fact that the temperature of the extreme black hole is zero , it is easy to show that the condition for having an extreme black hole is that the mass parameter is equal to @xmath50 , where @xmath50 is given as @xmath51 the metric of eqs .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , ( [ domega ] ) and ( [ g(r ) ] ) presents a black hole solution with inner and outer horizons , provided the mass parameter @xmath41 is greater than @xmath50 , an extreme black hole for @xmath52 , and a naked singularity otherwise ( see fig([fig1 ] ) for more details ) .",
    "this behavior is the same as reissner - nordstrm black holes , but , the metric function @xmath39 , presented here , differ from the standard higher - dimensional reissner - nordstrm solutions since the electric charge term in the metric function is proportional to @xmath53 and in the standard higher dimensional charged black hole solutions is proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "it is notable that for @xmath30 ( @xmath3 : einstein gravity ) , the third term in eq .",
    "( [ g(r ) ] ) vanishes and the solutions reduce to schwarzschild like solutions .",
    "in this section , we consider the @xmath17-dimensional action in which gravity is coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics field with an action @xmath55 , \\label{ig}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is a coupling constant and the exponent @xmath57 represented the nonlinear power of the electromagnetic field .",
    "varying the action ( [ ig ] ) with respect to the metric tensor @xmath20 and the electromagnetic field @xmath58 , the equations of gravitational and electromagnetic fields may be obtained as @xmath59 @xmath60 = 0 ,   \\label{maxeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath61    \\label{tnonmax}\\ ] ] it is easy to show that when @xmath57 goes to @xmath62 , the eqs .",
    "( [ ig])([maxeq ] ) , reduce to the in einstein - standard maxwell gravity in higher dimensions . the maxwell equation ( [ maxeq ] ) with metric ( [ metric ] )",
    "can be integrated immediately to give @xmath63 where @xmath64 , an integration constant where the electric charge of the spacetime is related to this constant . inserting the maxwell fields ( [ ftr ] ) and the metric ( [ metric ] ) in the field equation ( [ graveq ] )",
    ", one can show that these equations have the following solutions @xmath65 ^{s } , & \\text{otherwise } \\end{array } \\right .",
    ",   \\label{g(r)2}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the integration constant which is related to mass parameter . in the linear case ( @xmath66 )",
    ", the solutions reduce to the higher dimensional reissner - nordstrm solutions with linear maxwell source as they should be .",
    "straightforward calculation of kretschmann scalar shows that there is an curvature singularity located at @xmath44 .    before studying in details the spacetime ,",
    "we first specify the sign of the coupling constant @xmath56 in term of the exponent @xmath57 in order to ensure a physical interpretation of our future solutions . in fact",
    ", the sign of the coupling constant in the action ( [ ig ] ) can be chosen such that the energy density , i.e. the @xmath67 component of the energy - momentum tensor in the ortonormal frame , is positive @xmath68 this condition selects two branches depending on the range of the nonlinear parameter @xmath57 , @xmath69 while the cases @xmath70 is excluded because in these cases @xmath71 ( and charge term in ( [ g(r)2 ] ) ) vanishes .",
    "now , we want to investigate the special case , such that the electromagnetic field equation be invariant under conformal transformation ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) . the idea is to take advantage of the conformal symmetry to construct the analogues of the four dimensional reissner - nordstrm solutions in higher dimensions .",
    "it is easy to show that for lagrangian in the form @xmath74 in @xmath17-dimensions , @xmath75 $ ] ; so @xmath76 implies @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , in our case ( @xmath78 ) , for @xmath13 , the maxwell action ( [ graveq ] ) enjoys the conformal symmetry in arbitrary dimensions . in this case",
    "the metric function @xmath79 and electromagnetic field @xmath71 reduce to @xcite @xmath80 @xmath81 here , we calculate the electric charge of the einstein - conformally invariant maxwell solutions . to determine the electric field , we should consider the projections of the electromagnetic field tensor on special hypersurfaces",
    ". the electric charge per unit volume of the black hole can be found by calculating the flux of the electromagnetic field at infinity , obtaining @xmath82 which confirm that @xmath64 is related to the electrical charge of the spacetime .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( [ g(r ) ] ) with eq . ( [ gconformal ] ) ( and let @xmath83/(n-1)$ ] ) ,",
    "show that there is a correspondence between the einstein - conformally invariant maxwell solutions and the solutions of @xmath0 gravity without matter field .",
    "one can think about the same effects of @xmath84 in @xmath0 gravity ( eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) without @xmath85 ) and @xmath25 in einstein - conformally invariant maxwell gravity ( eq.([graveq ] ) ) and therefore @xmath42 is related to the charge parameter @xmath64 .",
    "in the presented paper , we considered the special case of @xmath0 gravity , so - called @xmath28 gravity and obtained its topological black hole solutions in higher dimensions .",
    "we foud that , such as charged black hole solutions , these solutions may be interpreted as black hole solutions with two event horizons , extreme black hole and naked singularity provide that the mass parameter @xmath41 is greater than an extremal value @xmath50 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "but the presented solutions differ from the standard higher - dimensional reissner - nordstrm solutions since the electric charge term in obtained metric function is proportional to @xmath53 and in the standard higher dimensional charged black hole solutions is proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "next , we presented topological black hole solutions in einstein gravity with nonlinear electromagnetic field .",
