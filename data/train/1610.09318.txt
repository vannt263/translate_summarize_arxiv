    "<S> lorentz violation in the quark sector induces a sidereal time dependence in electron - proton , proton - antiproton and proton - proton cross sections . at high energies </S>",
    "<S> nonperturbative effects are buried in universal nucleon parton distribution functions and lorentz violating effects are calculable in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on deep inelastic electron - proton scattering data collected from zeus and h1 at hera and show that a sideral time analysis of these events is able to set strong constraints on most of the coefficients we consider .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider lorentz violation in the quark sector as parametrized by the following lagrangian:@xcite @xmath0 where the coefficients @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are poorly constrained.@xcite these coefficients are obviously related to the corresponding coefficients for proton and neutron but the connection is heavily clouded by nonperturbative physics .    in a recent work@xcite </S>",
    "<S> we study the effects of these coefficients on the deep inelastic electron - proton cross section for which factorization theorems show that nonperturbative effects are confined to universal nucleon parton distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> details of the calculation can be found in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> here we present a short summary of the main phenomenological results .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the complete set of deep inelastic @xmath3 measurements performed by the zeus and h1 experiments at the hera collider.@xcite note that these measurements enter the global fits used to extract the proton parton distribution functions , therefore it is impossible to extract bounds on the coefficients @xmath4 from measurements of the sidereal time integrated cross section .    after taking into account the location and orientation of the zeus and h1 detectors the relation between the coefficients @xmath1 in the laboratory frame and the sun - centered frame acquires a sidereal time ( @xmath5 ) dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section at fixed values of bjorken @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( electron 4-momentum transfer squared ) can be schematically written as : @xmath8 \\ ; , \\label{eq : xs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the sidereal time frequency and @xmath10 are functions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these functions are completely determined in terms of fundamental standard - model parameters ( that we take from the particle data group@xcite ) and of the parton distribution functions of the proton ( for our central values we adopt the ct10 pdfs set@xcite and use the program maneparse@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the coefficients @xmath11 enter without any sidereal time dependence and can not be constrained by our analysis .    for each hera measurement </S>",
    "<S> we integrate eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : xs ] ) in four sidereal time bins and set to zero all but one of the @xmath4 coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the expected upper bounds that this analysis might imply can be calculated by generating a large number of pseudoexperiments that are consistent with the sidereal time averaged results ( i.e. , the published cross sections ) . for each pseudoexperiment </S>",
    "<S> we write a chi squared and extract the 95% upper limit on @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the expected upper limit is the median of this quantity over all pseudoexperiments . since the orientation of the zeus and h1 experiments are opposite to each other the rotations required to connect the laboratory frames at zeus and h1 to the sun - centered frame are different , but this has no effect on the bounds for individual coefficients @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of this analysis are presented in the first column of table  [ eltab : results ] where we consider the 12 coefficients @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and show the constraints that a potential sidereal time analysis of zeus and h1 data might produce . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider each hera measurement ( at fixed @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and show the strongest constraint . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_bounds_up ] we show the upper limits expected from a sidereal time analysis of hera data on @xmath20 and @xmath21 as a function of @xmath7 ( left plot ) and @xmath6 ( right plot ) ; each point corresponds to one of the 644 neutral current hera measurements.@xcite the strongest constraints come mostly from measurements at low @xmath7 and low @xmath6 ( very close to the kinematical boundary @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> constraints on these two coefficients are representative of constraints on @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we perform a global sidereal time analysis of the whole hera data set by combining all measurements into a single chi squared . </S>",
    "<S> the expected upper limits that we obtain are listed in the third column of table  [ eltab : results ] . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints are stronger than the best single measurement limits because this analysis makes full use of the correlations between the binned integrated cross sections at different values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we found that a sidereal time analysis of zeus and h1 data has the potential to set strong constraints on most @xmath4 coefficients . </S>"
