    "the structure of the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has recently received a lot of attention .",
    "theoretical progress in various directions is well in line with past , present , and upcoming experimental programs e.g.  at cern sps , rhic , lhc , and fair . among the key features of the phase diagram",
    "is the chiral phase transition at nonzero temperature and vanishing chemical potential .",
    "this transition has been and is studied extensively by various different approaches with an emphasis on the critical behavior of the order parameter as well as on the actual value of the transition temperature @xmath0 .",
    "lattice qcd calculations for example over the past years yielded @xmath0 at temperatures between @xmath1 and @xmath2 mev with a recent tendency towards a commonly found value @xcite .",
    "in various model approaches in mean - field approximation and beyond one finds a range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 mev , see e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "although an understanding of the universal properties of qcd is of great importance , it is also rewarding to investigate the value of @xmath0 which is not universal and can therefore be used to draw conclusions about specific details of the underlying dynamics of quarks and gluons .",
    "more precisely , specific models and their assumptions can be falsified in the approach presented here by a calculation of @xmath0 in qcd .",
    "a nonperturbative continuum approach to qcd is provided by the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) @xcite , which can be applied straight - forwardly also for finite temperature and chemical potential @xcite .",
    "the dses are well - suited to study the properties of qcd s elementary degrees of freedom , quarks and gluons . in this framework",
    ", various aspects of chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking have been studied some time ago via the dse of the quark propagator ( also referred to as the `` qcd gap equation '' ) at zero temperature ( see , e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) and in connection with the phase diagram of qcd ( see , e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the same framework also allows the consistent and covariant study of bound - state , i.e.  meson and baryon , properties . at zero temperature ,",
    "a level of sophistication beyond simple qcd modeling has been reached ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . at nonzero temperature and density ,",
    "analogous investigations are complicated by the additional variables introduced in the matsubara formalism .",
    "nonetheless , investigations of meson masses at and beyond the phase transition at zero chemical potential @xcite as well as certain aspects of the phase diagram @xcite have been conducted at various but mostly simpler degrees of sophistication . in the present context ,",
    "our focus is on dse studies of the chiral phase transition in qcd at finite temperature and zero chemical potential .",
    "it was shown some time ago that certain classes of models in the qcd gap equation in rainbow truncation yield a second - order phase transition with mean - field critical exponents @xcite .",
    "while the main emphasis of that investigation was the critical behavior and universality class of the phase transition , it also provided the corresponding values for @xmath0 , which ranged between @xmath5 and @xmath6 mev among the model interactions investigated . in somewhat different setups , using a separable interaction kernel in the gap equation @xcite or neglecting retardation effects @xcite , one obtaines values in the range between @xmath7 and @xmath8 mev .",
    "the pointwise behavior of all these interactions as a function of the gluon momentum is rather different , although in all cases it was determined by adjusting the relevant parameters to meson phenomenology at zero temperature .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to ask whether there is any simple relationship between the momentum dependence of the interaction and the value of @xmath0 . such a relationship could e.g.  be analogous to that found recently in studies of meson properties using a particular form of model interaction with a one - parameter setup . there",
    "the value of the free parameter determines an effective range of the intermediate- and low - momentum parts of the interaction .",
    "while ground - state properties of pseudoscalar and vector mesons were unaffected by variations in the model parameter , masses of excitations of any kind ( orbital or radial ) showed a strong and systematic dependence on the model parameter @xcite thus identifying excited - state properties as prime targets to study the particular details of the effective interaction in the dse formalism , in particular in the nonperturbative regime . in an analogous fashion ,",
    "the goal of the present work is to identify @xmath0 as a quantity with the same capability . in particular",
    ", one can expect a calculation of @xmath0 to impose even stronger restrictions on model parameters , beyond what is at hand at zero temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ formalism ] briefly sketches the quark dse in qcd at finite temperature , sec .",
    "[ models ] compares the model interactions used herein , sec .",
    "[ transition ] outlines how we compute @xmath0 and the critical exponents .",
    "the results are presented in secs .",
    "[ results ] and [ brt ] , the latter focusing on effects from corrections beyond rainbow truncation . conclusions and an outlook",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "all calculations are performed in euclidean space .",
    "we use the quark dse to study the chiral phase transition of qcd .",
    "it is an inhomogeneous nonlinear integral equation for the dressed - quark propagator , whose inverse at @xmath9 is of the form @xmath10 where the four - vector @xmath11 denotes the quark momentum and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are scalar functions of the momentum - squared . at nonzero temperature",
    "the presence of the heat bath implies an additional four vector , which leads to more structures in ( [ eq : propt0 ] ) @xcite . in the matsubara formalism one",
    "arrives at @xmath14 now the four scalar functions ( @xmath15 ) depend on the quark 3-momentum squared @xmath16 and the quark s fermion matsubara frequency @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the qcd gap equation in pictorial form reads @xmath19{0.12\\columnwidth}{\\includegraphics[width=0.12\\columnwidth]{diagram_propagator}})^{-1 } = ( \\parbox[c]{0.12\\columnwidth}{\\includegraphics[width=0.12\\columnwidth]{diagram_propagator_free}})^{-1 } + \\parbox[c]{0.40\\columnwidth}{\\includegraphics[width=0.40\\columnwidth]{diagram_selfenergy } } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the free quark propagator , @xmath21 the renormalized dressed gluon propagator and @xmath22 the renormalized dressed quark - gluon vertex . solving for @xmath23",
    "one needs expressions for the quark - gluon vertex as well as the gluon propagator .",
    "these can in principle be obtained    .[tab : models]parameter sets @xmath24 and @xmath25 used for the different interactions mn @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mn ] ) ; aww @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : aww ] ) ; mt @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mt ] ) ; mr @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mr ] ) ; together with corresponding observables in @xmath9 meson studies , where available .",
    "numbers are in gev except for @xmath24 ( gev@xmath26 ) and the chiral condensate , whose dimension is given explicitly . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mn interaction has to be treated somewhat separately , since the only free parameter in this case is @xmath24 whose choice completely determines @xmath27 . in terms of plain numbers it is interesting to see that mn yields the highest value for @xmath0 , followed by mr .",
    "aww and mt give the smallest numbers .          for a given interaction ,",
    "@xmath0 increases with @xmath25 , which is illustrated in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] . a straight - forward interpretation of this observation goes back to @xmath25 representing an inverse effective range of the interaction .",
    "in this picture , @xmath0 is higher for an interaction , for which this range is smaller , i.e. the major strength in the interaction comes from a region defined by the larger momentum scale @xmath25 .",
    "however , this effect is obviously minor compared to the differences with regard to the form of the interaction , in particular the appearance of the @xmath28-function term .    to further illustrate the details of the differences between the various forms for the interaction as well as to highlight their characteristic features , we plot @xmath0 as a function of three more specific properties of each model , namely @xmath29 in panel ( b ) , @xmath24 in panel ( c ) , and the chiral condensate in panel ( d ) .",
    "while the attempt to quantitatively correlate @xmath0 globally ( i.e.  across the different interactions ) to any of these fails , a clear structure is visible . throughout all panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] the aww and mt results are rather close together , but clearly separate from mr , which again is clearly separate from mn .",
    "both @xmath29 and @xmath24 investigated in the two middle panels have been interpreted as an `` integrated strength '' of the interaction . in fact , the latter is proportional to the integral over @xmath30 of the interaction at zero temperature for all interactions investigated here , if one leaves out the uv part @xmath31 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mt ] ) and ( [ eq : mr ] ) .",
    "[ fig : results ] in panel ( c ) clearly shows that there is no overall simple dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath24 . in the mt interaction , a constant value for @xmath29 leads to ( almost ) unchanged masses and decay constants for ground - state pseudoscalar and vector mesons , for which reason @xmath29",
    "can be termed `` integrated strength '' in this case instead of @xmath24 .",
    "again , fig .  [",
    "fig : results ] in panel ( b ) indicates no simple dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath29 . in both cases ,",
    "the absence of a simple relation is exemplified already by the fact that three points with the same @xmath29 , the characteristic feature for mt , in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] ( b ) and three points with the same @xmath24 , the characteristic feature for mr , in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] ( c ) each correspond to three different values of @xmath0 .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] ( d ) we plot @xmath0 as a function of an order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking , the chiral condensate , evaluated at @xmath9 . in a very simple picture , one could argue that , given a certain form of the dependence of the order parameter on the temperature ( see , e.g.  fig .  [",
    "fig : orderpar ] ) , an enlargement of the value of the order parameter at @xmath9 would naturally lead to an increase in @xmath0 .",
    "however , panel ( d ) clearly shows that the interactions used in our setup are not that simple .",
    "overall , these observations lead to the important possibility to establish distinct ranges of values for @xmath0 accessible for each type of interaction , which has the potential to rule out certain forms in a given truncation .",
    "we note here that various effects need to be taken into account beyond the simple setup presently used ; we will attempt to quantify some of them below . at this point , however , we can still try to attribute the clear differences apparent from all panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] to the structure of the interaction .",
    "the object of interest in this respect is the appearance and relative strength of the @xmath28-function term in @xmath27 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mn ] )  ( [ eq : mr ] ) : in the aww and mt interactions , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : aww ] ) and ( [ eq : mt ] ) , there is no such term . in the mr interaction , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mr ] ) , it carries half the strength of the coupling in the sense of the integral @xmath32 described above . in the mn interaction , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mn ] ) , it is the only term and obviously represents all of the interaction s strength . from this , one can say that a less pronounced @xmath28-function term in the interaction will lead to lower values of @xmath0 .",
    "while the rainbow truncation of the gap equation provides a simple setup for computations , one has to keep in mind that the necessary corrections in any given circumstance may change its results considerably .",
    "therefore we discuss here some of the most important effects from which a change , in particular to the critical temperature , is to be expected .    from a phenomenological point of view one can try to quantify the contribution of the rainbow - truncated gap equation to the full ( untruncated ) result .",
    "such an attempt has been made for meson properties at zero temperature in @xcite and has been extended to the baryon sector and exemplified for several hadronic observables in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to change the values of the available model parameters such that the resulting hadron properties , e.g.  the rho - meson mass , are deliberately overestimated by the rainbow - ladder truncation result . in this way one expects corrections beyond this truncation to bring it to the experimental value .    while we do not want to discuss the particular assumptions made in @xcite , the effect described there is relevant for our present study , since we start with model parameters fixed to meson phenomenology at zero temperature . to get a first estimate of the effects from a change of parameters at @xmath9 on @xmath0",
    ", we simply adapt the two parameter sets referred to as `` a '' ( which corresponds to our mt2 parameter set ) and `` b '' ( which has increased strength in the interaction to overestimate the rho - meson mass as discussed above ) in ref .  @xcite and add @xmath0 to the tab .",
    "i given there . in this table , a systematic ratio of @xmath33 is found for value in a divided by value in b for several hadron properties ( e.g.  @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , etc . ) .",
    "our values for @xmath0 in this respect are @xmath38 mev for set a and @xmath39 mev for set b , which produces a ratio of @xmath40 and thus fits perfectly into the picture .    for the present discussion here",
    "the relevant point is that parameter changes inferred from the phenomenological estimation of corrections expected beyond rainbow - ladder truncation are in agreement with investigations at zero temperature . in particular , one obtains an increase of @xmath0 by about one third , depending on the details of the corrections assumed .    a different investigation by d.  blaschke , d.  horvati , and d.  klabuar regarding the role of the polyakov loop in an analogous , separable setup of the quark dse at finite temperature indicates that the inclusion of a polyakov - loop potential shifts @xmath0 up by @xmath41 mev @xcite .",
    "this is also observed in other approaches such as polyakov - quark - meson studies or polyakov - nambu  jona - lasinio - type models , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "finally , we briefly quantify corrections from inclusion of more structure in the quark self - energy , in particular in the dressed quark - gluon vertex .",
    "ideally , one would together with the gap equation also solve the dyson - schwinger equations for the gluon propagator and the quark - gluon vertex  the two unknown ingredients in the dse for the quark propagator  as self - consistently as possible at any given finite temperature .",
    "such investigations have already been started at @xmath9 ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) and represent a natural and very promising , but at the same time rather involved path for future extensions of the present study .    in a more immediate way",
    ", one can identify corrections to rainbow truncation from the terms in the quark - gluon - vertex dse and attempt to incorporate these into the gap equation .",
    "pion - loop contributions have been investigated at @xmath9 in @xcite .",
    "@xcite reports preliminary results of an analogous study at finite temperature , which indicate a reduction of @xmath0 of about 5% upon the inclusion of pion - loop , but not scalar - meson - loop corrections in the quark self energy and no change of the ( mean field ) critical exponents .",
    "another effect , coming from the combination of two other vertex corrections , can be estimated by an extension of a simple mn - study of quark and meson properties presented in @xcite to finite temperature .",
    "this is a straight - forward procedure , which has many aspects and will be investigated in full detail elsewhere @xcite . for the moment",
    "we note that a first estimate of shifts in @xmath0 are of the order of 15% .",
    "another interesting observation is that in the course of dressing the bare quark - gluon vertex one can arrive at results with the possibility for solutions of the gap equation with @xmath42 .    to conclude this section",
    ", we remark that corrections to the rainbow truncation of the quark dse should not be viewed as corrections to a mean - field approximation ; corrections in the quark self energy in our present calculations happen at the level of the structure of the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "we would also like to emphasize that , although not demonstrated explicitly here , for finite current - quark masses we obtain a smooth crossover instead of a second - order phase transition .",
    "we have investigated the impact of various forms of an effective quark - gluon interaction in the rainbow - truncated quark dse in qcd at finite temperature on the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition .",
    "the established mean - field behavior of this transition in the present truncation is confirmed throughout . regarding non - universal aspects of the transition",
    ", it is apparent that there is no simple overall relationship between the distribution of the infrared strength of the interaction and the critical temperature , although 1 ) a trend can be extracted identifying the part of the interaction strength carried by a @xmath28-function term in some of the models as a qualitatively distincitve parameter , and 2 ) within the various models simple relations of @xmath0 and relevant model parameters do exist .",
    "changes of @xmath0 due to various corrections to the present truncation are quantified and put into context .",
    "in addition to effects already described in the literature we estimate particular types of corrections in the present work using phenomenological arguments on one hand as well as a simple model - extension of the quark - gluon vertex on the other hand .",
    "alltogether , the various corrections put our results in a consistent perspective with regard to the results for @xmath0 obtained in other approaches .",
    "furthermore , the present results clearly show that the chiral transition temperature is an excellent candidate for detailed studies of various aspects of the strong interaction .",
    "in particular it distinctively relates to both assumptions about as well as particular and detailed properties of the effective interaction between quarks and gluons in the dse setup .",
    "further studies beyond the present investigation will shed more light on this relationship as well as on how the mean - field behavior of the chiral phase transition may change beyond the current truncation .",
