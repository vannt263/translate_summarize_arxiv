    "the whim , whose temperature and density is thought to be about @xmath17  k and @xmath18@xmath19  @xmath7 , is hard to detect with the present - day detectors such ccd cameras .",
    "thermal and chemical properties of the whim , if observed , would bring us rich information about the structure formation and evolution of the universe .",
    "recent chandra and xmm - newton observations with the high resolution imaging spectroscopy enabled us to search for the whim emission @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite reported the significant detection of the emission from the whim gas , while the others could not because of the extremely low density of the gas compared with the high level of the the galactic foreground emission and the intrinsic background . on the other hand ,",
    "chandra and xmm observations with grating spectrometers also made the absorption - line study of the whim possible and restricted the whim density more significantly @xcite .    because suzaku xis is characterized by lower background level and higher sensitivity below 1 kev @xcite",
    ", we can observe the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) emission to the outer region of clusters near the virial radii @xcite .",
    "although @xcite detected no significant redshifted o lines from the outer region of a2218 with suzaku , they set a tight constraint on the intensity ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "reliable estimation of the foreground galactic emission is most important in constraining the whim emission .",
    "past studies have shown that suzaku xis can effectively constrain the galactic emission @xcite better than the previous satellites .",
    "the sculptor supercluster @xcite at a redshift of @xmath20 is one of the richest supercluster , composed of more than 20 clusters of galaxies @xcite including 5 abell systems .",
    "it is located near the south galactic pole . since whim is thought to distribute along the filamentary structures over several tens of mpc scale connecting clusters of galaxies",
    ", it is likely that superclusters contain significant amount of whim .",
    "the sculptor supercluster has been observed with rosat and asca . @xcite and @xcite found no indications of a largely extended x - ray emission in their observed regions , which is overlapping with our suzaku field . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "reported extended soft x - ray emission in 0.1 0.3 kev band with rosat pspc , and the region corresponds to @xmath214 degrees east of our observations .",
    "they suggested that the diffuse emission was tracing the whim .",
    "@xcite reported a @xmath22 detection of an oxygen absorption line from the whim in the `` sculptor wall''at @xmath23 using the chandra and xmm grating observations of a blazer behind this structure .",
    "the sculptor wall is located much closer than the sculptor supercluster in redshift and @xmath24 degrees westward from our observations .",
    "the estimated hydrogen density is @xmath25 @xmath7 under the assumption of the uniform absorber distribution along the line of sight between @xmath26 using the o column density .",
    "@xcite also reported results from the whim search in `` pisces  cetus supercluster '' at @xmath27 and `` farther sculptor wall '' at @xmath28 in the same line of sight as `` sculptor wall '' .",
    "in contrast to the result of `` sculptor wall '' , significant absorptions ( @xmath29 ) were not detected from any of the strong h - like and he - like transitions of c , o , and ne at the redshift .",

    "we adopt the galactic hydrogen column density of @xmath40 @xmath2 @xcite in the direction of a2811 , a2801 , a2804 , respectively .",
    "because the system is located near the south galactic pole , the galactic absorption and emission are both low and have no complex feature .",

    "note that we used the uniform arfs for the spectral fits of a2804 .",
    "we included the effect of the contaminations on the optical blocking filter of the xiss in the arfs . since the energy resolution also slowly degraded after the launch , due to radiation damage , this effect was included in the redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) by the `` xisrmfgen '' ftools task .",

    "the present result is consistent with the expected values from numerical simulations , indicating a baryon over - density @xmath86 by @xcite for example .",
    "we note that the dense part of whim is found only in the superclusters and the gas is likely to be inhomogeneous with a wide range of temperature and density . in the case of the bridge region between a222 and a223 , werner et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed the temperature to be  0.9 kev .",
    "such a high temperature ( also with high density ) yields lower emissivity of o and o lines .",
    "thus , estimation of temperature and density is not straightforward .",
    "( 0.45,0.45)fig8.eps    as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , @xcite reported a significant detection of o absorption line in the direction of the `` sculptor wall '' at @xmath87 .",
    "@xcite also searched for the c , o , and ne absorption lines from the `` pisces  cetus supercluster '' and the `` farther sculptor wall '' in the same line of sight as the `` sculptor wall '' .",
    "even though the sculptor supercluster and the above studied filaments are not physically connected with each other , we can compare the estimated hydrogen density .",
    "our upper limit on the density is twice larger than the `` sculptor wall '' value reported by @xcite .",
    "also , the overdensities derived for the `` pisces  cetus supercluster '' and `` farther sculptor wall '' are @xmath88 times of our result .",
    "this indicates a higher sensitivity of the absorption line measurement in the detection of whim .",
    "in fact , suzaku can not probably detect the o line emission from the `` sculptor wall '' because the redshift is too low to separate from the galactic emission lines .",
    "thus , future quantitative studies of the whim will need x - ray optics with larger effective area and instruments with much higher energy resolution such as microcalorimeters , which would play a key role in future investigation of the cosmic plasma diagnostics .",
    "suzaku carried out observations of the sculptor supercluster in four fields : a2811 , a2811 offset , a2804 , and a2801 regions .",
