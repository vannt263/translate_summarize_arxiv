    "hence , in recent years , bumps with a sharp cutoff due to the decay and/or annihilation of wimps were looked for in high precision measurements of the energy spectrum of such cosmic ray ( cr ) particles .",
    "a bump around e=620 gev with a sharp cutoff around e=800 gev in the combined flux @xmath3 of @xmath4 cosmic rays ( crs ) was reported by the advanced thin ionization calorimeter ( atic ) balloon experiment ( chang et al .",

    "the reported isotropy of the flux of high energy cr positrons observed with ams ( accardo et al .",

    ", we re - examine the possibility that the main origin of the high energy cr positrons observed near earth is secondary production in hadronic collisions of the primary cosmic ray protons and nuclei in the ism ( blum et al .",
    "2013 ; cowsik et al .",

    "2014 ) with high statistics and small systematic errors is consistent with that expected from secondary production of positrons in hadronic interactions of the primary crs in the local ism .",
    "in particular , the hardening of their spectrum with increasing energy between @xmath2 30 and 150 gev and its softening beyond 250 gev , as observed with ams02 ( aguilar et al .  2014 ) , are expected from the transition of their inverse compton scattering of diffuse galactic light from the thomson regime to the klein - nishina regime ( schlickeiser & ruppel  2010 ) .    moreover , the break near 1 tev in the combined @xmath4 flux , suggested by the data from h.e.s.s .",
    "( aharonian et al .  2008 ) may be the maximum re - acceleration energy of electrons in the ism due to their radiative energy - loss and escape from the galaxy by diffusion .",
    "indeed a break was reproduced in numerical calculations ( e.g. , stawarz et al .",
    "2010 ) , which have used the elaborate galprop numerical code ( moskalenko & strong 1998a , b ) .",
    "other standard astroparticle physics interpretations rather than a dark matter annihilation / decay signal are shortly discussed .",
    "the flux of primary cosmic ray nucleons ( free protons and nucleons bound in atomic nuclei ) in the energy range between several gev and pev per nucleon observed near earth is well described by ( e.g. , olive et al .",

    "hence , due to feynman scaling ( 1969 ) , secondary production of high energy positrons through the decay of @xmath19 and @xmath20 mesons , which are produced in hadronic collisions of cosmic ray nucleons with the baryons in the local ism where the mean baryon density is @xmath21 ( kalberla & dedes , 2008 ) inject into the cr halo a flux of @xmath8 s per unit volume roughly at a rate @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant that depends only on the power - law index of the product @xmath24 but not on e itself . in a steady state ,",
