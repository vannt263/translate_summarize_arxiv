    "schnirelman s theorem @xcite as well as berry s physical reasoning predict that quantum energy eigenfunctions ( wigner or husimi representation @xcite ) of systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic are uniformly distributed on the energy shell .",
    "heller , however , has shown that there exist quantum eigenfunctions which are strongly localized ( scarred ) on hyperbolic periodic orbits @xcite . at present , the general opinion is that scars are exceptional , while the majority consits of uniformly ( phase - space ) distributed eigenstates @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that there also exist weakly localized eigenfunctions , which continuously fill the `` gap '' between uniformly distributed and strongly localized eigenfunctions .",
    "conveniently , instead of single exceptions we here consider localization properties of the whole set of eigenfunctions of the system ; restricting our studies on finite dimensional hilbert spaces . to that purpose ,",
    "we introduce squared @xmath0 norms of husimi eigenfunctions as a measure for phase - space localization @xcite .",
    "as it will be shown in the sequel this measure proves amenable to semiclassical considerations .",
    "the classical dynamics of chaotic systems can be described by the time evolution of phase - space density functions .",
    "the corresponding propagator is the frobenius - perron operator @xcite , where the poles of its resolvent are called ruelle - pollicott resonances which coincide with decay rates of classical correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the quantum - classical correspondence , in particular the influence of ruelle - pollicott resonances on the quantum energy spectrum , is still a point of interest @xcite .",
    "we show that phase - space overlaps of energy eigenstates turn out lorentz distributed with respect to the differences of their eigenenergies .",
    "the lorentzians are determined by ruelle - pollicott resonances . in other words ,",
    "the probability that two eigenstates strongly overlap becomes large if the difference of their eigenenergies coincides with the position where the lorentzian is peaked . on the other hand ,",
    "if a pair of eigenstates strongly overlaps ( much more than random - matrix theory predicts ) each of them must be localized , i.e. scarred , in the same phase - space regions .",
    "we here consider systems with a compact two - dimensional phase space , in particular the unit sphere , whereby the hilbert - space dimension of the quantum counterpart becomes finite .",
    "periodically driving destroyes integrability in general .",
    "moreover , a stroboscopic description leads to a hamilton map or a floquet operator in the classical or quantum case , respectively .",
    "a well known representative of such a dynamics is the kicked top @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the kicked top is described by a stroboscopic map of an angular momentum vector whose length is conserved , for such a dynamics the phase spaces is the unit sphere . the classical time evolution is usually described in the `` hamilton picture '' , whereby the stroboscopic consideration leads to a hamilton map which describes a trajectory after each period , @xmath1 here the primes denote the final position @xmath2 and momentum @xmath3 coordinates . on the sphere",
    "the canonical phase - space coordinates are given by the azimuthal and polar angle as @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the quantum time evolution in the schrdinger picture is generated by a floquet operator @xmath6 which is built by the components of an angular momentum operator @xmath7 ; we choose it as a sequence of rotations about the @xmath8 and @xmath9-axis followed by a nonlinear torsion about the @xmath9-axis , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is called the torsion strength and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are rotation angles .",
    "the dimension of the quantum hilbert space is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the quantum angular momentum formally replacing the inverse of planck s constant , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 in this article ) . since @xmath6 is unitary ,",
    "it has @xmath18 orthogonal eigenstates with unimodular eigenvalues characterized by eigenphases ( quasi - eigenenergies ) as @xmath19 .",
    "the classical counterpart has in general a mixed phase space . by the choice of the parameters as @xmath20 and @xmath21 the dynamics",
    "becomes strongly chaotic .",
    "for @xmath22 which we use for numerical results stable island are not resolved by the planck cell of size @xmath23 , whereby the dynamics looks , from a quantum point of view , effectively hyperbolic .    in order to compare the results of the kicked top with those of random - matrix theory ( rmt ) we here discuss the symmetries of the system .",
    "the dynamics proves invariant under nonconventional time reversal . in terms of random - matrix theory",
    "the floquet matrix belongs to the circular orthogonal ensemble ( coe ) , where the coefficients of the eigenvectors can be chosen real in a suitable basis @xcite .",
    "we here expand the floquet operator in the basis of eigenstates of the @xmath9-component of the angular momentum operator , @xmath24 . by a unitary transformation given by a simple rotation , @xmath25 ,",
    "the floquet matrix becomes symmetric , @xmath26 , where the eigenvectors become real . here",
    "@xmath27 denotes transposition .",
    "this is an important property , since the @xmath0 norm of a husimi function which we will use as a measure for phase - space localization is invariant under rotations .",
    "therefore , eigenvectors of the kicked top must be compared to real random vectors .",
    "the rotation is of form @xmath28 , whereby the transformed floquet matrix becomes @xmath29 after commutation of the rotation @xmath30 with the torsion the product @xmath31 is a rotation about the @xmath32-axis . using the latter relation",
    "the transformed floquet matrix finally becomes @xmath33 which is obviously symmetric .",
    "another way to describe classical time evolution is the `` liouville picture '' , as the propagation of density in phase space .",
    "the corresponding propagator , the frobenius - perron operator @xmath34 , is defined through the hamilton map as @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes an arbitrary phase - space density function . note that the hamilton map is invertible and area preserving .",
    "an expectation value of a classical observable is given by the phase - space integral @xmath37 where we have introduced the dirac notation . to avoid confusion with quantum wave functions we here use round brackets .",
    "note that this notation is generally to read as a linear functional , where the density function @xmath38 belongs to the banach space @xmath39 and the observable @xmath40 to the dual space @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that both functions are real , otherwise @xmath40 is to complex conjugate in the integral notation ( [ average ] ) .    for classically chaotic systems ( we assume purely hyperbolic dynamics ) correlations of observables",
    "decay exponentially in time . due to ergodicity the time correlation can be written by a phase - space integral , @xmath42 where the time dependence of the observables must be read as @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 denotes the stationary ( invariant ) density with @xmath45 , i.e. the constant on the sphere .",
    "the associated stationary eigenvalue is @xmath46 and ensures that no probability gets lost , i.e. it preserves the @xmath39 norm of a density function .",
    "we may replace the observable @xmath47 by an initial density function @xmath38 and further we assume that @xmath48 , then the correlation function can be written in terms of the frobenius - perron operator .",
    "finally , we introduce the ruelle - pollicott resonances @xmath49 which are to identify as decay rates , @xmath50 where the @xmath51 denote the coefficients of the resonance expansion .",
    "we here assume the simplest case that resonances appear with multiplicity @xmath46 , otherwise the spectral decomposition of the frobenius - perron operator would be given by a so - called jordan block structure , whereby the expansion on the rhs would become more complicate .",
    "it should be remarked that the decay rate is precisely given by the logarithm of @xmath49 which is more convenient to consider in continuous - time dynamics .",
    "while the @xmath49 are located inside the unit circle on the complex plane , the logarithm of @xmath49 are customarily chosen to be in the lower half plane . due to the fact that the frobenius - perron operator preserves the positivity of density functions the resonances are real or appear as complex pairs .",
    "the trace of the frobenius - perron operator defined through @xmath52 , i.e. setting image and original points in ( [ fpoper ] ) equal , becomes @xmath53 in terms of the resonances .",
    "we here have separated the stationary eigenvalue @xmath46 from the summation of the resonances .",
    "we should carefully distinguish between forward and backward time evolution , since we do nt expect an increase of correlations for the backward time propagation .",
    "it has been shown that the backward time frobenius - perron operator has the same resonances .",
    "ruelle - pollicott resonances are defined as the poles of the resolvent of @xmath34 , @xmath54 the corresponding `` eigenfunctions '' are not square - integrable functions like those of the quantum propagator , but distributions .",
    "it is known that unstable manifolds of periodic orbits function as supports of these singular eigenfunctions . for the backward time evolution",
    "stable and unstable manifolds exchange their role .",
    "supported by arguments of pertubation theory , weber et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that classical ruelle - pollicott resonances of the frobenius - perron operator can be found by investigating the propagator restricted on different phase - space resolutions .",
    "moreover , one finds approximate eigenfunctions which scar along unstable manifolds",
    ". this important result will be useful for the comparison of classical and quantum eigenfunctions .",
    "we restrict our considerations on the hilbert space of square integrable functions @xmath0 . for the system considered the phase space is the unit sphere , where it becomes convenient to use the basis of spherical harmonics .",
    "the frobenius - perron operator becomes an infinite unitary matrix whose unimodular spectrum can be separated into a discrete part for integrable components and into a continuous part for hyperbolic components of the dynamics .",
    "truncation to an @xmath55 matrix corresponding to a restricted phase - space resolution destroys unitarity .",
    "the spectrum becomes discrete and the eigenvalues are inside or on the unit circle .",
    "as @xmath56 increases some eigenvalues prove @xmath56-independent ; these are said to be stabilized .",
    "stabilized eigenvalues reflect spectral properties of the frobenius - perron operator .",
    "they are ( almost ) unimodular for integrable components or stable islands .",
    "in contrast , eigenvalues which are stabilized inside the unit circle reflect ruelle - pollicott resonances .",
    "non - stabilized eigenvalues have typically smaller moduli than the stabilized ones .",
    "they change their positions as @xmath56 increases till they reach positions of resonances where they can settle for good .",
    "we also know that the eigenfunctions corresponding to stabilized eigenvalues are localized either on tori for unimodular eigenvalues or around unstable manifolds for non - unimodular eigenvalues .",
    "we expect that the latter eigenfunctions converge weakly to singular resonance `` eigenfunctions '' .",
    "we will call them approximate resonance eigenfunctions in the sequel .    fig .",
    "[ resdens ] ( a ) shows the eigenvalues of the truncated frobenius - perron matrix in the complex plane . here",
    "the dimension is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the maximal total angular momentum of the spherical harmonics in which the density functions are expanded . in ( b ) we see a grey - scale shaded plot of the eigenvalue density calculated from truncated matrices ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "dark spots corresponding to large amplitudes of the density indicate resonance positions , since resolution independent eigenvalues highly increase the density through accumulation . a comparison of both shows that some eigenvalues in ( a ) reflect resonance positions ( see also tab",
    ".  1 ) . in fig .",
    "[ ef4 ] ( a ) the modulus of the approximate eigenfunction is plotted in phase space , where the dark regions belong to large moduli of the complex - valued function .",
    "the comparison with the unstable manifolds ( b ) of a weakly unstable period-4 orbit shows that the approximate eigenfunction scars along these manifolds . in ( c ) and",
    "( d ) we see the scarring of the eigenfunction of backward time propagation ( same resonance as in ( a ) ) along the stable manifolds .",
    "to represent quantum operators in a way close the corresponding classical observables it is convenient to start from coherent states .",
    "for the @xmath60 group coherent states can be generated by a rotation of the state @xmath61 as @xmath62 . in the @xmath63 basis",
    "these coherent states are given by @xmath64 since the set of the coherent states is overcomplete , there are several ways describing quantum operators with coherent states @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , one can use the so - called @xmath65 function , defined as the weight of coherent - state projectors in the continuous mixture @xmath66 the integral is over the unit sphere , where @xmath67 . on the other hand",
    ", we have the so - called @xmath68 function , the coherent state expectation value of an operator , @xmath69 .",
    "it is important that @xmath68 is a smooth function on phase space , while @xmath65 can strongly oscillate , particularly in the shortest wave lengths .",
    "however , in contrast to the coherent states of weyl groups , @xmath65 functions always exist .",
    "both functions can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics @xcite , @xmath70 where the summations break off at the total angular momentum @xmath71 .",
    "the hilbert space of phase - space functions must not be confused with the hilbert space of quantum wave functions ; we therefore use round brackets for the scalar product already introduced in ( [ average ] ) , @xmath72 .",
    "although the @xmath65 functions tend to oscillate more strongly than the @xmath68 functions , the expansion coefficients of the @xmath65 and @xmath68 functions corresponding to the same operator converge to one another in the classical limit , @xmath73 for fixed @xmath74 .",
    "it is easy to see that the trace of an operator product can be written as the scalar product of @xmath65 and @xmath68 as @xmath75 . in particular ,",
    "if the set @xmath76 of wave functions form an orthogonal basis of the quantum hilbert space , then the @xmath65 and @xmath68 functions of ket - bras @xmath77 and @xmath78 generate biorthonormal sets in the hilbert space of phase - space functions @xmath79 the @xmath68 function of a density operator @xmath80 is also called husimi function .",
    "if the density operator is a projector of form @xmath81 the corresponding husimi function is a phase - space representation of a quantum wave function .",
    "we call the @xmath78 husimi eigenfunction if the @xmath82 denote floquet eigenstates .",
    "the latter notation becomes obvious in the next section .",
    "we further distinguish between diagonal husimi eigenfunctions @xmath83 and skew ones @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "the husimi propagator @xmath86 is defined through the time evolution of a quantum density operator @xmath87 as @xmath88 using the floquet eigenstates , @xmath89 , the husimi eigenfunctions are easily calculated as @xmath90 .",
    "the husimi propagator thus has @xmath91 unimodular eigenvalues whose phases are differences of the floquet eigenphases .",
    "there is an @xmath18-fold degeneracy of the eigenvalue @xmath46 corresponding to the diagonal husimi eigenfunctions @xmath83 which are real and normalized as @xmath92 .",
    "all other ( skew ) husimi eigenfunctions with @xmath85 are complex and their phase space - integral vanishes . in basis of spherical harmonics",
    "the husimi propagator becomes an @xmath93 matrix ( husimi matrix ) .",
    "the diagonal representation of the husimi propagator is simply given as @xmath94 the husimi spectral density is identified as the density - density correlation function with respect to the floquet eigenphases , @xmath95 where @xmath96 . some authors prefer the normalized density @xmath97 .",
    "the squared @xmath0 norm of a diagonal husimi eigenfunction , @xmath98 is the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) with respect to coherent states ( phase - space distribution ) .",
    "it becomes large if the husimi function is strongly localized in phase space , say scarred on periodic orbits . on the other hand ,",
    "the squared @xmath0 norm of a skew husimi eigenfunction can be understood as the overlap of two diagonal husimi functions on phase space , @xmath99 from the schwarz inequality , @xmath100 it becomes obvious that for large values of @xmath101 both diagonal husimi eigenfunctions must be localized in the same phase - space regions .",
    "we illustrate two examples .",
    "a constant function on the sphere is of course a uniformly distributed function .",
    "but note that it is not a husimi eigenfunction , since the corresponding density operator is of form @xmath102 .",
    "using the normalization @xmath103 the husimi function becomes @xmath104 .",
    "for the squared @xmath0 norm we find @xmath105 for uniform function . in comparison ,",
    "the random - matrix averaged squared @xmath0 norms of diagonal husimi eigenfunctions is larger by a factor 2 ( see sec .  [ rmt ] ) which can be explained by quantum fluctuations .",
    "a most strongly localized husimi function , in contrast , corresponds to a density oparator which is a coherent - state projector . due to the invariance under rotations",
    "the @xmath0 norm is the same for all coherent - state husimi functions . using the coherent - state projector @xmath106 and ( [ exaktl2 ] )",
    "one easily finds for the squared @xmath0 norm @xmath107 for strongly localized husimi function .",
    "it becomes obvious that squared @xmath0 norms of most strongly localized and uniformly distributed husimi functions differ by a factor of order @xmath18 .",
    "we here show the calculation of the @xmath0 norm from vector coefficients in the @xmath63 basis ( @xmath108 ) . introducing the decomposition of unity in terms of the angular momentum states , @xmath109 ,",
    "the @xmath0 norm of a skew husimi eigenfunction becomes a four - fold sum , @xmath110 from the definition ( [ cs ] ) of the coherent states we find , using the relations @xmath111 for @xmath112 , @xmath113 after a few further steps the phase - space integral @xmath114 leads to a kronecker @xmath115 and to a beta function @xcite for the @xmath116- and @xmath117-dependent part , respectively .",
    "we thus obtain for the coefficients of the summation ( [ summation ] ) @xmath118 we make use of the argument of the kronecker @xmath115 and get for the @xmath0 norm @xmath119 the latter formular will be used for the calculation of husimi @xmath0 norms of random vectors in the next section .",
    "in order to compare the results of the kicked top with those of random - matrix theory we now consider diagonal husimi eigenfunctions and replace the coefficients by real or complex random numbers due to the orthogonal ( coe ) or unitary ensemble ( cue ) , respectively @xcite . it is easy to see from ( [ l2normdiag],[l2normskew ] ) that the @xmath0 norm of a husimi function is invariant under rotations . as it has been shown in sec .",

    "it should be remarked here that semiclassical corrections are of next to leading order of @xmath134 .",
    "therefore we do not neglect this order in our rmt results .",
    "let us consider first the cue .",
    "since @xmath135 , we can complete the summations over the diagonal @xmath136 and off - diagonal @xmath137 part .",
    "thus we have for the cue @xmath138 it might not be easy to see that this results to @xmath139 . to that end we present an alternative way to calculate the averaged @xmath0 norm which is unfortunately not applicable for the coe @xcite .",
    "an arbitrary complex random vector can be written as @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is a unitary random matrix .",
    "a coherent state is generated through a rotation operator as @xmath62 .",
    "we thus have @xmath142 .",
    "the product @xmath143 defines a new unitary random matrix , where the haar measure keeps unchanged @xmath144 .",

    "for the coe we again complete the diagonal and off - diagonal summations in ( [ sumbinom ] ) , whereby a further contribution remains , because of the factor @xmath146 of the fourth moment ( [ avipr ] ) , @xmath147 the latter equation can be calculated as follows @xcite .",
    "we rewrite @xmath148 with @xmath149 .",
    "we now show that @xmath150 the generating function of @xmath151 is @xmath152 which is easily seen from taylor expansion , @xmath153 squaring the generating function gives @xmath154 where @xmath155 . comparing the latter equation with the geometric series @xmath156 finishes the proof .",
    "the aforementioned contribution ( [ forcontrib ] ) becomes more familiar by the approximation @xmath157 the averaged @xmath0 norms finally become @xmath158 as an interesting point to remark here the coe eigenstates are somewhat more localized than the cue eigenstates , since their averaged @xmath0 norm contains a further contribution of order @xmath159 .",
    "but in contrast to the fourth moment ( [ avipr ] ) - it might be understood as the averaged ipr with respect to the @xmath63 basis - the difference vanishes in the classical limit @xmath160 .",
    "however , for both ensembles the averaged squared @xmath0 norms are roughly twice larger than for a constant distribution on the sphere .    for the skew husimi eigenfunctions",

    "the integral on the lhs of ( [ trace ] ) , however , is defined and gives the leading order contribution @xmath18 .",
    "we replace the traces by sums of the ruelle - pollicott resonances ( [ trres ] ) and make use of the symmetry @xmath212 , @xmath213 note that the eigenvalue @xmath46 is also dropped in the leading order term .    to get from the smoothed @xmath0 norms @xmath214 to a mean value @xmath215 we have to divide it by the smoothed level density of the husimi spectrum .",
    "the density of the husimi spectrum is identified as the density - density correlation function with respect to the floquet eigenphases , @xmath216 this spectral density can be calculated from the time fourier transformation of the form factor .",
    "the smoothed density is given by a truncated fourier transformation as @xmath217 where we have separated the leading order term ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "it is known that the form factor is small as the time @xmath177 is small ( @xmath218 or @xmath219 for cue or coe , respectively ) .",
    "thus , the summation up to the ehrenfest time which is much smaller than @xmath18 becomes negligible and the smoothed spectral density is nearly constant .",
    "before we write down the final result , we consider the truncated fourier transformation of the resonances . since the moduli of the resonances are smaller @xmath46 , the summations in ( [ sumres ] ) converge quickly such that we can replace the ehrenfest time @xmath203 by @xmath220 , @xmath221 the constant term coincides with the rmt result ( [ skewl2coe ] ) , where @xmath222 . the resonances lead to an @xmath104 ( alias @xmath223 ) correction in form of overlapping lorentz distributions ( see ( [ lorentz ] ) ) . in the classical limit the resonance corrections vanish as @xmath18 goes to infinity .",
    "however , for finite dimension we see non - universal corrections which are related to the chaoticity of the system .",
    "if , for instance , the classical dynamics is strongly chaotic such that all correlations vanish after one iteration , the resonances are close to the origin and the averaged @xmath0 norms show no deviations from rmt result .",
    "before we come to numerical results we should discuss some prelimaries .",
    "the kicked top is known to have a mixed phase space .",
    "although elliptic islands of stable periodic orbits are much smaller than the planck cell , bifurcations can be responsible for further localization phenomena which are sometimes called super scars @xcite .",
    "but in contrast to the resonances , bifurcations strongly influence spectral correlations .",
    "that means that peaks resulting from bifurcating orbits are higher for the smoothed @xmath0 norms than for the averaged @xmath0 norms .",
    "thus , we are able to distinguish between localization phenomena of resonances and bifurcations",
    ". the smoothing is again done by a convolution with a sinc function ( [ smooth ] ) . from the contributions of the diagonal husimi eigenfunctions",
    "we have neglegted the squared @xmath39 norms which correspond to the stationary eigenvalue .",
    "[ mitqd ] shows ( a ) the smoothed @xmath0 norms , ( b ) the mean @xmath0 norms , and ( c ) the smoothed spectral density . in ( a )",
    "we see a couple of peaks at the husimi eigenphases @xmath183 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and @xmath226 . in ( c )",
    "are remarkable peaks at the positions @xmath227 and after division we see in ( b ) that these peaks are suppressed , while the other peaks still have the same magnitude .",
    "comparison with the semiclassical prediction is shown in fig .",
    "[ qmithsp ] . due to the fact that stabilized eigenvalues representing the resonances",
    "are of largest moduli we expect that the semiclassical prediction is almost independent of the set of eigenvalues as well as all stabilized ones are taken into account . in ( a )",
    "the semiclassical prediction is computed from ( i ) eight stabilized eigenvalues , ( ii ) eigenvalues of modulus larger @xmath228 , and ( iii ) almost all eigenvalues of the truncated frobenius - perron matrix .",
    "comparison of ( i)(iii ) shows that the semiclassical prediction is mainly influenced from a few classical eigenvalues of large moduli which represent the resonances . in ( b )",
    "we compare the semiclassical prediction ( iii ) with the quantum result . in particular for the peaks we find a very good agreement .",
    "this result shows that the probability to find strongly overlapping eigenfunctions becomes large if the differences of their eigenphases coincides with the phase of a leading resonance , i.e. resonance of large modulus . in comparison with the background the peaks are small ( a few percent ) .",
    "however , we show in the next section that strongly scarred eigenfunctions are mainly responsible for the peaks .",
    "the eigenvalues of the frobenius - perron matrix ( c ) are plotted logarithmically ( @xmath229 versus @xmath230 ) .",
    "these are easily associated with the peaks in ( a ) .",
    "it should be remarked that there is no eigenvalue of large modulus which corresponds to the small peaks at @xmath231 in fig .",
    "[ mitqd ] ( a ) .",
    "in this section we consider single eigenfunctions and verify the statement that phase differences of strongly overlapping eigenfunctions coincide with phases of leading resonances . due to the schwarz inequality we first check",
    "that skew husimi eigenfunctions with large @xmath0 norms are composed by scarred diagonal husimi eigenfunctions . in tab .",
    "[ scartab ] we find 25 @xmath0 norms of most strongly localized skew husimi eigenfunctions , their eigenphases , and the corresponding diagonal husimi eigenfunctions ( the numbers correspond to the enumeration in tab .  [ hustab ] ) . due to the symmetry",
    "@xmath232 we have restricted the eigenphases as @xmath233 .",
    "the 32 most strongly localized diagonal husimi eigenfunctions are presented in tab .",
    "[ hustab ] .",
    "comparison of both tables proves that all skew husimi eigenfunctions considered are composed from at least one scarred diagonal eigenfunction . in fig .",
    "[ ql2dgn ] ( a ) @xmath0 norms of all diagonal husimi eigenfunctions are shown , while in ( b ) we see 530 ( of total @xmath234 ) @xmath0 norms of most strongly localized skew husimi eigenfunctions .",
    "due to our foregoing results localized skew husimi eigenfunctions appear frequently around the resonance phases .",
    "interestingly , there are only two remarkable eigenfunctions ( no 11 and 12 in tab .",
    "[ scartab ] ) around the husimi eigenphases @xmath231 . moreover , in both cases one of the underlying diagonal husimi eigenfunctions is no 16 in tab .",
    "[ hustab ] . further investigation of this eigenfunction has shown that it is strongly scarred on two bifurcating orbits of periods @xmath46 and @xmath146 .",
    "it seems that we found a super scar corresponding to a period - tripling bifurcation .",
    "in conclusion , phase - space localization of quantum eigenenergy functions , say scarring , is not only explained by periodic orbits , but also by ruelle - pollicott resonances and their corresponding resonance eigenfunctions .",
    "in particular , we found the interesting result that quantum floquet eigenfunctions are pairwise localized in the same phase - space regions if the difference of their eigenenergies coincides with the phase of a leading resonance , i.e. resonance close to the unit circle .",
    "but note that this is a statistical statement which does not make a prediction for individual eigenstates .",
    "moreover , we can not determine if there are either a few strongly scarred or many weakly localized eigenfunctions .",
    "however , the semiclassical prediction of the averaged @xmath0 norms is in a good agreement with numerical results .",
    "the correspondence between scars around periodic orbits described by heller and the results of this paper might be understood as follows : resonances can be computed by a so - called cycle expansion , where resonances appear as roots of a polynomial whose coefficients are calculated from contributions of short periodic orbits ( pseudo orbits ) @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , scars typically appear around weakly unstable periodic orbits . on the other hand , these weakly unstable",
    "orbits mainly induce the cycle expansion .",
    "although the kicked top has a mixed phase space , localization effects of stable orbits or bifurcations can be neglected if such phase - space structures are not resolved by the planck cell .",
    "further investigations are needed for the understanding of the so - called super scars which are related to bifurcations .",
