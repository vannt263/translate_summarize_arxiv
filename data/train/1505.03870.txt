    "the discovery of the higgs boson in 2012 @xcite has established the existence of a new kind of elementary particle , which couples to the other particles of the standard model ( sm ) in a non - universal way .",
    "the sm predictions that the higgs couplings to heavy gauge bosons and fermions are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value , have been confirmed within experimental uncertainties for the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bosons and for the third - generation fermions @xcite .",
    "however , no direct measurements of the higgs couplings to the light fermions of the first two generations are available at present .",
    "it is not difficult to come up with models in which these couplings can deviate significantly from those predicted in the sm .",
    "for example , in @xcite it was proposed that the yukawa couplings may depend in a non - trivial way on the higgs field , and that this might explain the hierarchies seen in the spectrum of fermion masses . a more general analysis of different classes of models in which the higgs couplings to fermions can differ significantly from those of the sm was presented in @xcite .",
    "probing the higgs couplings to light fermions is thus of paramount importance .",
    "this includes both flavor - diagonal and flavor - changing interactions .",
    "correlations between the two types of couplings , which to some extent are model dependent , have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the cms collaboration has recently reported a slight excess in the search for the flavor - violating decay @xmath19 @xcite , which , if interpreted as a signal , corresponds to a branching fraction @xmath20 . not surprisingly , this observation has led to much theoretical speculation .",
    "our focus in the present work is on the higgs couplings to light quarks ( @xmath21 ) . in a couple of beautiful papers",
    ", it has recently been proposed that one might get access to these couplings by focussing on the rare , exclusive decays @xmath0 of the higgs boson @xcite , where the final state contains a single vector meson @xmath22 .",
    "such measurements are extremely challenging at the lhc , as the corresponding branching fractions are in the range of few times @xmath23 .",
    "nevertheless , observing these processes is not hopeless in view of the fact that in its high - luminosity run the lhc will serve as a higgs factory . with 3ab@xmath24 of integrated luminosity , about @xmath25 higgs bosons per experiment will have been produced @xcite , and even larger higgs samples could be obtained at a future facility such as a 100tev proton - proton collider .",
    "the theoretical description of rare exclusive decays employs the formalism of qcd factorization @xcite , which was originally developed for the analysis of hard exclusive qcd processes and later extended to the more complicated case of exclusive hadronic two - body decays of @xmath26 mesons @xcite . in a recent paper",
    ", we have systematically developed this approach for the case of the exclusive decays @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "these processes are less susceptible to new physics and can therefore be used to test the qcd factorization approach and extract valuable information about the light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) of various mesons @xmath30 . observing exclusive radiative decays of heavy electroweak gauge bosons in the high - luminosity run of the lhc",
    "would provide a proof of principle that this kind of rare - decay searches can be performed in a hadron - collider environment . a promising first step in the direction of observing the decays",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 , along with the corresponding higgs decays @xmath33 and @xmath34 , has recently been reported by the atlas collaboration  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend previous studies of exclusive radiative decays of the higgs boson in several important ways .",
    "we include qcd radiative corrections and resum large logarithms arising from evolution effects between the higgs mass scale and a low hadronic scale .",
    "we comment on the structure of power - suppressed corrections to the factorization formula , study the effects of the off - shellness of the photon in the @xmath35 process and include the power - suppressed @xmath36 contribution .",
    "we also take into account the effects of @xmath37 mixing .",
    "most importantly , our analysis allows for generic non - standard higgs couplings to sm fermions and gauge bosons , including cp - odd interactions .",
    "we devise a strategy which allows us to eliminate the theoretical uncertainties related to the dominant @xmath35 conversion contribution , including possible new - physics effects , to almost arbitrary precision .",
    "this is a crucial prerequisite for achieving the desired sensitivity to the yukawa couplings of light quarks .",
    "finally , we address all relevant @xmath0 decays to both light and heavy mesons in one coherent formalism . for technical details on the qcd factorization approach",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .    in the following section we start by defining effective couplings of the higgs boson to sm fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "these include both cp - even and cp - odd couplings . in section  [ sec : radiativedec ]",
    "we discuss in detail the calculation of the different contributions to the @xmath0 decay amplitudes in the qcd factorization approach , distinguishing between `` direct '' contributions induced by the yukawa couplings of the higgs boson to light quarks ( @xmath21 ) and `` indirect contributions '' resulting from a @xmath38 transition followed by the conversion of the off - shell boson into a vector meson .",
    "we show that uncertainties related to the effective @xmath39 coupling strength , as regards to both theoretical uncertainties and possible new - physics contributions , can be eliminated by studying the ratio of the @xmath0 and @xmath40 branching fractions . in section",
    "[ sec : pheno ] we present a phenomenological analysis both in the sm and in generic new - physics models with modified higgs interactions .",
    "in particular , we point out that measurements of the ratios of the @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath40 branching fractions can yield highly complementary information on the real and imaginary parts of the bottom - quark yukawa coupling .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] contains a summary of our results and the conclusions .",
    "technical details are relegated to five appendices .",
    "in our analysis we assume sm couplings for all particles other than the higgs boson .",

    "our choice of factoring out a loop factor in the second line is made for later convenience . for sm extensions in which the new particles are heavy , the coefficients of these higher - dimensional operators",
    "are suppressed by two powers of the new - physics scale .",
    "we emphasize that the above is not a complete list of operators .",
    "for instance , we have not included higher - dimensional operators of the form @xmath50 and @xmath51 , whose coefficients are already strongly constrained by data .",
    "these operators would enter our analysis only via the @xmath38 one - loop amplitudes , and without loss of generality their effects can be absorbed into the coefficients @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "both the cp - even couplings @xmath56 and the cp - odd coefficients @xmath57 are real . in the sm @xmath58 , while @xmath59 and all the remaining couplings in the second line vanish .",
    "our @xmath60 and @xmath61 parameters for quarks are related to the corresponding yukawa couplings by @xmath62 in the last step we have introduced rescaled parameters normalized to the mass of the @xmath7 quark .",
    "this will turn out to be a useful definition for the quarks of the first two generations .    for our analysis",
    "we need the quark masses at the scale @xmath63 , where @xmath64gev is the higgs - boson mass @xcite .",
    "we define the running quark masses at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in the @xmath65 scheme , starting from the low - energy values given in @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath66gev , @xmath67mev , @xmath68mev , @xmath69mev , and @xmath70mev . for the top quark we obtain @xmath71gev starting from @xmath72gev , which we have derived from the present world average obtained in @xcite using the conversion tables provided in @xcite .",
    "present lhc data are largely insensitive to the yukawa couplings to light quark flavors . from a global @xmath73 fit to the measured higgs rates ,",
    "the authors of @xcite have derived the bounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 at 95% confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "the corresponding bounds for the original parameters are @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "bounds on the cp - violating higgs couplings to third - generation fermions have been studied in @xcite . under the assumption that the higgs couples to the electron in the standard way ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) , the strongest constraints come from the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron .",
    "they arise from two - loop barr - zee diagrams such as the one shown on the left in figure  [ fig : eedm ] and yield @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 at 90% cl .",

    "bounds from the electron edm can also be derived for the local operators multiplied by @xmath54 and @xmath55 in ( [ eqn : effl ] ) . evaluating the one - loop contributions to the electron edm shown on the right in figure  [ fig : eedm ]",

    "this contribution is logarithmically uv divergent , because the inner structure of the effective @xmath39 and @xmath93 vertices is not resolved .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath94 agrees with a calculation performed in @xcite .",
    "the subtraction scale @xmath95 should be identified with the scale of the new physics , which is responsible for these non - standard interactions .",

    "we will refer to vectors orthogonal to the plane spanned by @xmath102 and @xmath103 as being transverse . up",

    "the leading - order feynman diagrams are shown in figure  [ fig : diags ] . in the first two graphs , the higgs boson couples to the quark and anti - quark pair from which the meson is formed .",
    "we refer to this as the `` direct '' contribution to the decay amplitude @xcite .",
    "it can be calculated from first principles using the qcd factorization approach @xcite , because the energy released to the final - state meson is much larger than the scale of long - distance hadronic physics @xcite . at leading power in an expansion in @xmath105",
    ", the direct contribution can be expressed as a convolution of a calculable hard - scattering coefficient with the leading - twist lcda of the vector meson @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding factorization formula was derived in @xcite using the formalism of soft - collinear effective theory @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , for a given helicity amplitude , the power corrections to the leading term are suppressed by @xmath106 for light mesons and @xmath107 for mesons containing heavy quarks of flavor @xmath108 .",
    "even for the @xmath7-quark these power corrections are negligible .",
    "the third diagram in figure  [ fig : diags ] shows a different production mechanism , in which the vector meson is produced via the conversion of an off - shell photon or @xmath18 boson produced in a @xmath38 transition @xcite .",
    "we refer to this as the `` indirect '' contribution .",
    "it involves the hadronic matrix element of a local current and thus can be expressed in terms of the decay constant @xmath109 of the vector meson .",
    "the direct contribution is sensitive to the yukawa coupling of the higgs boson to the quarks which make up the vector meson .",
    "we shall find that in the sm the direct and indirect contributions to the @xmath0 decay amplitude interfere destructively .",
    "they are of similar size for @xmath110 , while the direct contributions are smaller than the indirect ones by factors of about 0.06 for @xmath111 , 0.002 for @xmath112 , and few times @xmath113 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the sensitivity to the yukawa couplings thus crucially relies on the precision with which the indirect contributions can be calculated .",
    "we will come back to this point below .",
    "the most general parametrization of the @xmath0 decay amplitude is @xmath116 , \\ ] ] where both the final - state meson and the photon are transversely polarized . from ( [ ampl ] )",
    ", the decay rate is obtained as @xmath117 here @xmath118 is the fine - structure constant evaluated at @xmath119 @xcite , as appropriate for a real photon .",
    "we choose to normalize the decay amplitude in ( [ ampl ] ) to the vector - meson decay constant @xmath109 , which is defined in terms of a matrix element of a local vector current .",
    "since we consider neutral , flavor - diagonal mesons , the definition of the decay constants ( and of other hadronic matrix elements ) is complicated by the effects of flavor mixing . in complete generality ,",
    "such a neutral meson @xmath22 can be regarded as a superposition of flavor states @xmath120 .",
    "we can thus define flavor - dependent decay constants @xmath121 via @xmath122 a certain combination of these flavor - specific decay constants can be measured in the leptonic decay @xmath123 .",
    "the corresponding decay amplitude involves the matrix element of the electromagnetic current @xmath124 .",
    "we thus define @xmath125 here @xmath126 denote the flavor coefficients in the naive constituent - quark model , where @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 etc .",
    "it follows that @xmath130 and so on . with these definitions ,",
    "the electromagnetic decay rate is given by @xmath131 in @xcite , the so - defined decay constants @xmath109 have been extracted using the most recent experimental data .",
    "our motivation for factoring out these decay constants in ( [ ampl ] ) is that they can be determined experimentally without adopting any specific model for flavor mixing . as we will discuss in section  [ subsec : indirect ] , the dominant terms in the indirect contributions to the @xmath0 decay amplitudes are proportional to precisely these quantities .",
    "we first consider the direct contribution to the decay amplitude shown in the first two diagrams in figure  [ fig : diags ] , in which the higgs boson couples to the quarks contained inside the vector meson . in order to calculate the corresponding contributions to the form factors @xmath132 defined in ( [ ampl ] ) ,",
    "one calculates the corresponding partonic amplitudes with on - shell quark and anti - quark states and then projects these amplitudes onto the leading - twist lcda of a transversely polarized vector meson @xmath22 .",

    "the transverse decay constants are scale - dependent quantities , since the qcd tensor current has a non - zero anomalous dimension .",
    "the leading - twist lcda @xmath137 can be interpreted as the amplitude for finding a quark with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath138 inside the meson . and define the product @xmath139 in terms of a matrix element of a non - local quark current with flavor @xmath103 , in analogy with relation ( 4 ) in @xcite . because the lcdas are normalized to  1 , and given the present large uncertainties in the shapes of these functions , it is a safe approximation to employ su(3 ) symmetry and replace @xmath140 . ]",
    "it depends on the choice of the factorization scale @xmath95 employed in the factorization formula .",
    "the two leading - order graphs shown in figure  [ fig : diags ] are supplemented by the diagrams in figure  [ fig : nlographs ] , which arise at @xmath141 .",
    "including these effects is crucial in order to control the scale dependence of the transverse decay constant @xmath135 , the yukawa coupling @xmath142 and the lcda @xmath143 .",

    "we work in dimensional regularization and subtract uv and ir divergences in the @xmath65 scheme .",
    "the product of the bare decay constant times the lcda of a transversely polarized vector meson is related to the product of the corresponding renormalized quantities via @xmath146 where at one - loop order @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
