    "wave - particle duality is a central aspect of quantum processes .",
    "it is well known that the schrdinger equation describes such a duality in the form of wave packets solutions , particularly with the gaussian wave packets [ 2 - 5 ] .",
    "wave packet solutions of the schrdinger equation possess an interesting properly that even in the absence of an external potential they exhibit dispersion .",
    "such dispersion occurs at very short time scales , causing interference for electron waves .    in quantum potential formalism , wave packet dispersion results from the tendency of quantum trajectories to accelerate away from each other .",
    "quantum trajectories for a free gaussian wave packet , given by @xmath0 , indicate that components of the wave packet starting off at close by yet different initial positions and initial speeds intersect after a short time , exhibiting a shock formation .",
    "intersection of characteristics lines is a typical aspect of nonlinear systems .",
    "however , in quantum dynamics of wave packets , quantum trajectories are assumed to be non - crossing . in the following exact analysis of quantum wave packet dynamics we drop this assumption , and the complete nonlinear system",
    "is analyzed using general theory of riemann invariants .",
    "this leads to the interesting result that quantum wave packets develop shock wave discontinuities immediately after their formation .",
    "beginning with the next section , we investigate the existence of shock wave phenomenon in quantum hydrodynamic formulation of the schrdinger wave equation .",
    "it is shown that for a general wave function solution of the schrdinger equation a non - zero quantum force causes characteristics to intersect , hence generates shock wave discontinuities in a quantized system .",
    "such discontinuities have a travelling wave form , and correspond to particle motion in the free particle case .",
    "we take the example of a gaussian wave packet to calculate the position and time of formation of quantum shocks in section 3 , whereas section 4 gives a summary of the main conclusions of the work and its relation to some recent experiments on electron waves .",
    "in the quantum potential approach , the general form of the wave function can be written as @xmath1 .",
    "then the time - dependent schrdinger equation , with an external potential : @xmath2 gives , after separating real and imaginary parts , the following equations@xmath3@xmath4 where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are the basic equations of quantum dynamics [ 6 ] in a fixed eulerian frame , with respect to which the relative velocity of an element is @xmath8 .",
    "we write the equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) as a single matrix equation , and keep to the one dimensional case only",
    ". then equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) give,@xmath9{cc}% 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right ]   \\left [ \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\rho_{t}\\\\ u_{t}% \\end{array } \\right ]   + \\left [ \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}% u & \\rho\\\\ q_{\\rho } & u \\end{array } \\right ]   \\left [ \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\rho_{x}\\\\ u_{x}% \\end{array } \\right ]   = 0 . \\label{3}%\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the component of the velocity @xmath11 along the @xmath12-direction . here",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 , etc .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for system ( 3 ) can be calculated from  the characteristic equation@xmath15{cc}% u-\\lambda & \\rho\\\\ q_{\\rho } & u-\\lambda \\end{array } \\right ]   = 0 , \\label{4}%\\ ] ] which gives@xmath16 thus the two eigenvalues @xmath17 are@xmath18 according to riemann theory of shock waves [ 7 ] , these eigenvalues give the characteristic speed for families of characteristics @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus we have@xmath21 and the corresponding eigenvectors are given by@xmath9{c}%",
    "m_{r}^{1}\\\\ m_{r}^{2}% \\end{array } \\right ]   = \\left [ \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\pm\\sqrt{\\rho / q_{\\rho}}\\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right ]   .",
    "\\label{9}%\\ ] ]    in general , equations for characteristic lines for the system can be written as@xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "for shocks to develop , these characteristic ( 10 ) must intersect at some common point in space .",
    "this occurs if the slope of each characteristic increases with the initial time @xmath24 . in view of equations ( 7 ) and (",
    "8) this is the case provided @xmath25 , that is , if the quantum force @xmath26 does not vanish .",
    "another way to state shock condition is to expand function @xmath27 for @xmath28 in the neighborhood of each characteristics as@xmath29 then any two neighboring characteristics @xmath27 and @xmath30 intersect provided@xmath31 this is the shock condition for the system ( 3 ) , which we shall use in the following to calculate the time of shock formation .",
    "having obtained the necessary ( and sufficient ) shock conditions ( 12 ) , we can now explicitly determine the ( travelling ) shock wave solutions for the system ( 3 ) .",
    "this is done in the appendix , using riemann invariants .",
    "these calculations show that the shock waves develop if the quantum force is non - zero , thus the phenomenon is of purely quantum nature .",
    "since for a free gaussian wave packet the quantum force is non - zero in general , this implies the existence of quantum shocks in the case of free gaussian wave packets .",
    "gaussian wave packet solution to the schrdinger equation for a free particle is given by the wave function@xmath32 where @xmath33 is the uniform constant speed of the wave packet , and the measure of the spread @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "correspondingly , the amplitude and the phase functions are given by @xmath36 and the quantum potential is,@xmath37 using @xmath38 , we obtain from equation ( 16 ) the speed of a wave packet element@xmath39 hence by integration , the position of a wave packet component is@xmath40 here @xmath41 and @xmath33 denote the initial position and velocity of the wave components , respectively .",
    "since by the above analysis the characteristics along which each wave packet component travels must intersect , we determine the location of the quantum shock in this case . using equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) , the equation of characteristic",
    "is given by@xmath42 then from the shock condition ( 12 ) , we have@xmath43 substituting for @xmath44 , @xmath10 , and @xmath12 from equations ( 16 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) respectively , and then taking @xmath45 we have , after some simplification,@xmath46 and therefore , from equations ( 7 ) and ( 8),@xmath47 equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) give the time and position for the quantum shock associated with the gaussian wave packet ( 13 ) .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper shows that if in any region of space the quantum force tends to increase , a shock - like situation will develop .",
    "this must be so , since slope of the characteristics ( 19 ) then increases , causing characteristic curves to intersect .",
    "this was explicitly shown for the case of gaussian wave packets , where the quantum force is equal to @xmath48 ; which although decreasing first , then increases , and eventually attains a constant limit as @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . this indicates that the quantum force causes the wave packet to burst rather than spread smoothly .",
    "if the relative velocity of the gaussian wave packet and the lab frame coincides , quantum shock occurs at time @xmath52 , and position @xmath53 , travelling with the speed @xmath54 .",
    "equation ( 22 ) shows that this speed differs from the classical formula by a constant @xmath55 due to wave packet dispersion .",
    "a similar analysis can be applied to the case of airy beams [ 8 ] , and to the recently observed leviton structures [ 9 ] ,  where limits on electron interferometry has been reduced to the attosecond scale [ 10,11 ] . for quantum density soliton waves , representing particle - like localization ,",
    "such discontinuities do not form , since quantum force in this case is identically zero .",
    "this result also has implications for the problem of equivalence principle in quantum theory [ 12 ] .      to obtain the riemann invariants for the system ( 3 ) , we take a linear combination of the equations ( 3 ) with coefficients being the components of the eigenvectors ( 9 ) , this gives:@xmath56 since @xmath57 , it follows that@xmath58 then substituting for @xmath59 and @xmath60 into equation ( a1 ) we have@xmath61 and using equations ( 7 ) and ( 8):@xmath62 integrating we have the two constants ( riemann invariants ) , @xmath63 and @xmath64 along the characteristics:@xmath65 thus eliminating @xmath10 and @xmath66 , we have the solution for @xmath67 and @xmath68 : @xmath69 which can be easily verified as a ( traveling ) shock wave solution to the system ( 3 ) .",
    "we notice in the above analysis that if the quantum force is zero , then the shock speeds @xmath70 and @xmath71 equal the speed @xmath10 .                v. e. madelung , _",
