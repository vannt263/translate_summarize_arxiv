    "the difficulty of obtaining absolute reddening estimates toward globular clusters ( gcs ) has plagued distance determinations , and in turn absolute age estimates @xcite .",

    "this problem becomes even more severe for gcs affected by differential reddening @xcite .",
    "several methods have been suggested to provide robust reddening estimates based on either medium- and broad - band photometry + @xcite or high - resolution spectra @xcite .",
    "however , current methods to estimate cluster reddenings may be affected by systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "this applies not only to gcs with very low reddening such as m3 @xcite , but also to moderately reddened clusters like @xmath0 cen .",

    "( 1998 ) indicates reddening variations of @xmath5 across the body of the cluster , while 2mass data @xcite show a very clumpy reddening distribution outside 1@xmath6 ( 100  pc ) from the cluster center .    in a recent investigation @xcite",
    ", we presented accurate optical ( _ bri _ ) and near - infrared ( _ jk _ ) photometry for stars in @xmath0 cen . adopting a metal - intermediate chemical composition ( @xmath7 ) and an age coeval with the bulk of the @xmath0 cen stars",
    ", we found a plausible fit of the anomalous red giant branch ( @xmath03 , lee et al .",
    "1999 ) if we increase the distance modulus by @xmath8 , and the reddening by @xmath9 0.03 .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath03 branch could be a clump of stars located @xmath10 pc beyond the main body of @xmath0 cen , and that there may be a clumpy reddening distribution across the cluster . to further constrain the possibility of differential reddening toward @xmath0 cen",
    ", we decided to use hot hb stars ( @xmath11 k ) , since their relation between effective temperature and photometric color is minimally affected by chemical composition ( webbink 1985 ) .",
    "we adopt a reddening - free temperature index based on photometry , @xmath2 = c_1 - 0.2(b - y)$ ] , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite , to estimate the reddening of individual hot hb stars .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that the @xmath2 $ ] index is a very robust temperature indicator for these stars .",
    "a set of 110 @xmath14 images of were collected by l.  m.  freyhammer in april 1999 with the danish telescope ( eso , la silla ) .",
    "the average seeing of these images is @xmath915 and the field of view is 14@xmath1514  on the cluster center .",
    "these have been supplemented with 30 _ uvby _ images of the southwest quadrant of collected by f.  grundahl in april / june 1999 with the same telescope , together with a sample of hd standard stars .",
    "we also have 210 _ vby _ images collected with the danish telescope by hilker and collaborators in two observing runs ( 1993 and 1995 , see hilker 1999 ; hilker & richtler 2000 ) .",

    "near - infrared @xmath21 images of @xmath0 cen collected in 2001/2002 with sofi@ntt ( eso , la silla ) were analyzed together with data from 2000 , available in the eso archive .",

    "this figure shows that hot hb stars in are systematically redder and display , at fixed @xmath2 $ ] , larger color dispersions ( @xmath27 ) compared to m@xmath113 ( @xmath28 ) and ngc@xmath1288 ( @xmath29 ) values higher than for the other two clusters .",
    "this does not appear to be the result of an overall shift of the cluster loci  the mid - lines appear to agree very well , suggesting that the absolute calibrations are consistent . obviously , reddening variations might scatter stars up and down but not horizontally .",
    "hb stars in omega cen outnumber the other cluster samples by almost a factor of ten .",
    "therefore the random photometric error distribution is populated farther out into the wings , and the apparent spread for @xmath2\\approx1.2 $ ] of omega cen stars ought be due to sample size . ] .",
    "the spread in color might be due to variations in the reddening toward @xmath0  cen , since the @xmath2 $ ] index is reddening - free and the colors of hot hb stars should marginally depend on metal abundance .    to confirm that colors of hot hb stars are metal - independent we transformed theoretical zero age horizontal branches ( zahbs ) for three different chemical compositions into the ( @xmath25 vs @xmath2 $ ] ) observational plane using the color - temperature transformations and bolometric corrections of castelli ( 2005 , private communications ) . for more details concerning the input physics and",
    "the adopted evolutionary parameters see pietrinferni et al .",
    "2 shows that hb structures hotter than 8,500 k ( @xmath30 ) are scarcely affected by metal abundance ; the same applies to the other and broad - band colors .",
    "note that current scenario depends at most very weakly on an alpha - element enhancement , since according to current evolutionary predictions only stellar structures cooler than 6,500 k appear to be affected ( see fig . 1 in cassisi et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "supported by this evidence , we estimated the differential reddening for each hot hb star in by fitting fiducial sequences to the hot hb stars in m@xmath113 and in ngc@xmath1288 in the @xmath25 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 vs @xmath2 $ ] planes and in the ( @xmath26 ) vs @xmath2 $ ] plane . from the extinction model of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , we derived extinction coefficients for the bands ( column 4 of table 1 ) , and the mean differential reddening in the four colors ( columns 1 and 2 of table 1 ) . allowing for the estimated reddening of ngc@xmath1288 and m@xmath113",
    ", we find a mean reddening for @xmath33 ( from the ngc@xmath1288 comparison ) or @xmath34 ( from m@xmath113 ) .",
    "these estimates agree well with values available in the literature .",
    "the typical photometric precision in the colors is @xmath35 and @xmath36 for hot hb stars in m  13 and in ngc  288 , respectively .",
    "note that the absolute reddening of @xmath0  cen calibrated against m@xmath113 is smaller than that calibrated against ngc@xmath1288 , suggesting that the published reddening for m@xmath113 might be slightly low ( i.e. , it should be @xmath37 instead of 0.02 ) or the reddening of ngc@xmath1288 might be high (",
    "i.e. , it should be @xmath38 instead of 0.03 ) .",
    "however , the concordance between the color excesses estimated from the different colors suggests that the difference does _ not _ stem primarily from photometric calibration errors .",
    "although the new mean reddening value for @xmath0  cen agrees well with literature values , reddening estimates for individual hot hb stars present a star - to - star scatter larger than our error budget . in particular , the reddening seen in the @xmath25 color ranges from @xmath39 to @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , while the reddening from the @xmath26 color ranges from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "similar values obtain for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 colors .",
    "this suggests variable reddening toward the cluster core with a dispersion @xmath45 and supports the results of cannon & stobie ( 1973 ) , who found reddening variations in  with @xmath46 .",
    "evolutionary effects in the ( color ) vs @xmath2 $ ] planes could only produce bluer hot hb stars at a given fixed luminosity .",
    "however , these colors are not very sensitive to gravity at these temperatures , so luminosity evolution should be _ along _ the ( color)-@xmath2 $ ] relationships , and not _",
    "away _ from them . to make this key point more clear , the inset in fig .",
    "2 shows that the off - zahb evolution , core - he burning phase , of selected hot hb models ( y=0.246 , z=0.001 , m=0.508 , 0.53 , 0.58 @xmath47 ) takes place along the ( color)-[c ] relation .",
    "this means that only a reddening variation or a non - stellar spectral energy distribution can move an object off the ( color)-[c ] relation .    to further constrain this hypothesis ,",
    "we have also investigated the color distribution of hot hb stars in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 colors .",
    "again , we estimated the ridge lines of hot hb stars in the different ( color ) vs @xmath2 $ ] planes and the color - distances of individual objects from the ridge lines .",
    "3 shows the distribution for all six colors together with gaussian fits ( solid lines ) . to assess whether individual color excesses might be due to photometric errors , we investigated the star - by - star correlations among the different colors .",
    "4 shows that the color excesses are well correlated in both medium and broad - band photometry .",
    "note that the outliers in @xmath48 and @xmath49 are stars close to the cluster center ( d @xmath50 15 ) whose photometry could be affected by crowding .    finally , we investigated the spatial distribution of less- , more- , and average - reddened hb stars ( respectively , outside and within @xmath51 ) .",
    "5 shows that the distribution of these objects is clumpy . in particular , at the largest radii shown ,",
    "less - reddened hb stars ( blue dots ) outnumber the more - reddened ones ( red dots ) , especially in the northwest , northeast , and southeast quadrants .",
    "moreover , less - reddened stars on the east ( left , @xmath52 ) side of the cluster outnumber those on the west side , and a less pronounced although still real absence of blue dots is seen in the northwest ( top right ) quadrant and at small radii .",
    "there is also evidence for a particular shortage of more - reddened stars with @xmath53 and an unusually low dispersion in reddening in the southwest quadrant , with few blue or red dots present at larger radii .",
    "we have derived homogeneous and accurate _ uvby _ and _ vi _ photometry for .",
    "an empirical method based on hot hb stars provides robust differential reddening estimates relative to two globulars marginally affected by reddening , ngc@xmath1288 and m@xmath113 . in all colors ,",
    "the reddening estimates for individual stars show variations of at least a factor of two within our field .",
    "this supports the suggestion of differential reddening toward by dickens & caldwell ( 1988 ) and by freyhammer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from comparisons between evolutionary predictions and accurate multi - band photometry , and also the mild extinction variations detected by minniti et al .",
    "( 1992 ) from linear polarization .",
    "unfortunately , the latter study does not cover the cluster core .",
    "finally , circumstellar emission has been recently detected in five red giants near the tip of the rgb and agb by boyer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in spitzer space telescope irac images ranging from 3.6 to 8.0 microns .",
    "the overall distributions on the sky of more- and less - reddened stars are rather different , suggesting that the foreground material is clumped on arcminute angular scales .",
    "however , more- and less - reddened stars are also found close together on the sky , suggesting that either : ( a )  the absorbing material also displays structural features on arcsecond scales , or ( b )  some of the absorbing material is within the cluster , and we are seeing front - to - back differences as well as foreground gradients .",
    "our results show that is indeed subject to variable reddening , which should be taken into account in photometric investigations .",
    "omega cen is different from m22 , where the _ entire _ color dispersion among rgb stars may be due to patchy foreground extinction ( richter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "however , dust in front of or inside does complicate the efforts to uncover the details of its formation history and metallicity spread , and more work to quantify the extinction pattern is highly desirable .",
    "thus , these findings should be independently confirmed with different stellar tracers .",
    "for instance , high - resolution spectra across @xmath54 or perhaps the na - d lines plus accurate multiband photometry of rgb stars would be very useful to disentangle reddening and metallicity effects .",
