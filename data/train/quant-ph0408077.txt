    "the entanglement present in natural spin systems @xcite has been a subject of serious interest in recent years .",
    "it is believed that this entanglement can even have consequences on the macroscopic properties of such systems @xcite .",
    "the entanglement is found to exhibit interesting behavior near the points of quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "ground states of some finite systems can serve as a convenient template for generating multipartite entangled states @xcite .",
    "creating the state requires only cooling the system down .",
    "a number of spin structures can be investigated to determine their entanglement properties in the ground state , in particular a ring @xcite , as well as other lattice structures @xcite . however ,",
    "1d chains and lattices of various dimensions are not the _ only _ physical systems whose fabrication is possible with current technology .",
    "it is possible to extend the above line of research on entanglement in spin systems to other than spin chains . in particular ,",
    "various technologies have evolved which can make any member of an array of qubits interact with any other member @xcite .",
    "one such structure is the star in which a number of spins interact through one central spin @xcite .",
    "apart from our work on the ground state entanglement in a spin - star @xcite , recently interesting non - markovian dynamics @xcite , quantum cloning @xcite and quantum gates @xcite in such a system has been investigated by other authors .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     having set out the relevant states we now review the state vectors for energy levels i and ii at the extremes of the pure ring ( @xmath0 ) and pure star ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the eigenstates for the pure @xmath2 ring for @xmath3 are given by wang in @xcite .",
    "note that in our model there is a central spin which is uncoupled from the outer spins for @xmath0 .",
    "consequently it doubles the degeneracy of all the ring eigenstates .",
    "energy level i is the ground state for the pure ring .",
    "it has energy @xmath4 and it is a mixture of @xmath5 energy level ii for the pure ring is a mixture of @xmath6 in the case of the pure star the energy eigenstates are given in @xcite .",
    "energy level i for the pure star is a mixture of @xmath7 energy level ii for the pure star is a mixture of @xmath8 a few remarks on degeneracy : from table [ tbl : sraction ] it is apparent that some states have been omitted here .",
    "for example , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are also eigenstates for the pure ring at this point of energy level ii . however , from the energy level diagram in figure [ fig : energies ] it can be seen that for @xmath11 the energy level splits and some states move up towards @xmath12 as @xmath13 approaches 1 . therefore , in the mixtures above we have only included states that feature throughout all of energy level ii .",
    "similarly , at @xmath1 ( the star end ) there are additional states present in energy level ii due to degeneracy in @xmath14 .",
    "however these additional states diverge from energy level ii for @xmath15 and therefore they have also been omitted above .    given these extremes",
    ", we can form an impression of how the ring state must mutate into the star state as @xmath13 changes from 0 to 1 .",
    "our next step is to write down a general expression for the state of each energy level which can cover a range of values of @xmath13 . to do this",
    ", we split the graph into three regions - a ` ring ' region , a ` star ' region , and an ` intermediate ' region .",
    "these regions are separated by the energy level crossings , causing discontinuities in the entanglement .",
    "figure [ fig : regions ] illustrates these regions .     and @xmath16 involved in the expressions for the ground states of @xmath3 for various values of the parameter @xmath13.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]      in the ground state the ring and star regions correspond to energy level i. it is straightforward to write down a general expression for the two degenerate eigenstates in energy level i : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are all functions of @xmath13 . from ( [ eqn : srcpurering ] ) and ( [ eqn : srcpurestar ] ) we see that at @xmath0 ( the ring ) , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . at @xmath1 ( the star ) ,",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 have been calculated numerically as functions of @xmath13 and are plotted in figure [ fig : regions ] .",
    "the reduced density matrix for nearest neighbors that arises when we take an equal mixture of the above two states is @xmath27 where we have defined @xmath28 .",
    "this gives a concurrence @xmath29 note that in the star region , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are of the same sign , which essentially makes the concurrence proportional to @xmath30 , and thus it decreases with decreasing @xmath13 because the @xmath31 ratio decreases .",
    "it vanishes when the ratio falls below @xmath32 . in the ring region ,",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are of opposite sign and @xmath33 , which gives concurrence as @xmath34 . in the ring region",
    "@xmath35 is positive and the concurrence decreases with increasing @xmath13 because @xmath36 increases .    for next - to - nearest neighbours ,",
    "the reduced density matrix is @xmath37 and this gives a concurrence @xmath38 this expression for the concurrence neatly explains how the next to nearest neighbor concurrence for @xmath3 varies with @xmath13- in the ring region @xmath39 and the next to nearest neighbor concurrence is low , whereas in the star region @xmath40 and thus the concurrence is higher .      finally we consider the intermediate region , in which energy level ii is the ground state .",
    "given the two extremes at the star and ring ends for energy level ii above , we postulate the state is a mixture of @xmath41 the nearest neighbour reduced density matrix is given by @xmath42 which gives concurrence @xmath43 .",
    "the next - to - nearest reduced density matrix is given by @xmath44 which also gives concurrence @xmath43 .",
    "hence we have shown that this energy level always has zero entanglement for both nearest and next to nearest neighbors .    in summary",
    ", we have analysed the form of the state vectors of the energy levels i and ii at the extremes of the star and ring models .",
    "we have then interpolated the states to give general forms which cover the range @xmath45 . using these general forms for the states we have obtained analytic formulae for the concurrence which match the numerical results .      as a final thought in this section ,",
    "we note that , the intermediate region , in which concurrence turns out to be zero , is not entirely uninteresting .",
    "in fact , it can even be regarded as the most interesting region of the model because it allows the production of a four particle ghz ( greenberger - horne - zeilinger ) state .",
    "suppose we apply a magnetic field to separate the degenerate states of eqs.([interstate1 ] ) and ( [ interstate2 ] ) in the intermediate region and follow it up by a measurement of the central spin . then the state of the outer spins can be projected with a probability of @xmath46 ( which is reasonably high , namely @xmath47 to @xmath48 in the intermediate region ) onto the state @xmath49 .",
    "this is a very interesting state because , for all bipartite partitions of the system , the state is maximally entangled .",
    "this state is an example of a four particle ghz state . to our knowledge",
    ", there does not yet exist any simple scheme for producing a ghz state from the ground state of a system of interacting spins . in our case , of course , both the application of a magnetic field and the measurement on the central spin are crucial .",
    "however , we can regard the ghz state as a  simple derivative \" of our ground state in the intermediate region .",
    "even when the production of the ghz state is unsuccessful , the state of the outer spins is projected to yet another type of interesting multiparticle entangled state namely @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "this state has the property that the concurrence between any two spins is @xmath52 , which is the _ maximum _ possible entanglement in a collection of @xmath53 spins in which all pairs of spins are equally entangled @xcite(in the present case , @xmath3 ) .",
    "the analysis also shows the _ robustness _ of the process of multiparticle entangled state production from ground states of spin stars @xcite . any star geometry with a sufficiently large number of outer spins placed in a ring",
    "will have them physically close and will thereby add unwanted ring interactions ( interactions of an outer spin with its neighbors ) .",
    "our calculations here show that throughout the star region ( as long as the ring interactions are not too strong ) , we can produce the states @xmath54 or @xmath55 which have the property that the concurrence between any two spins is @xmath52 .",
    "this happens with a probability @xmath56 ( about @xmath57 ) in the star region when the degeneracy of the ground states is lifted by a magnetic field and a measurement is performed on the central spin .",
    "thus in the same way as described for the pure star in ref.@xcite , multi - particle entangled states can be produced in a star polluted with some degree of ring interaction .",
    "in this section we attempt to give a general explanation of the form of the ground state that applies to general values of @xmath53 .",
    "we start from the observation that , if two spins interact with each other via the @xmath2 interaction then the ground state is the singlet state .",
    "that is , the energy is minimised when the two spins are antiparallel . as a general hypothesis",
    "then , we suppose that , in the combined star and ring model ground state , the @xmath2 interaction generally tries to put adjacent spins into a singlet state .",
    "below we apply this hypothesis to even and odd @xmath53 separately and consider the effect that this would have on the ground state .",
    "firstly we consider the case @xmath3 .",
    "if we expect the @xmath2 interaction to form singlets , then when in a ring we might expect the superposition of singlet states depicted graphically in figure [ fig:4pic ]",
    ". here and henceforth ( in the figures [ fig:4pic]-[fig:5pic ] ) the sign @xmath58 in the superposition should be quite generally interpreted to mean superposition with a general phase .",
    "we have always varied these phases to optimize the overlap of our test states ( those in figures [ fig:4pic]-[fig:5pic ] ) with the actual ground states .",
    ".,height=48 ]    to determine how close this superposition is to to the ground state of the star - ring combination the fidelity between the ground state and this superposition was calculated and is plotted in the top left graph in figure [ fig : ovs ] where the fidelity is marked by @xmath59 . as can be seen",
    ", the fidelity is very close to 1 on the ring - side , giving credence to the intuitive state . as @xmath13 increases",
    ", the central spin is brought in to interact with the other spins .",
    "there is consequently an odd number of spins and the system can not form singlets .",
    "the system is said to be ` frustrated ' .",
    "we would expect this to decrease the nearest - neighbour entanglement and this is exactly what happens while energy level i is the ground state - the nearest neighbour entanglement decreases as @xmath13 increases .",
    "it is natural to inquire whether a similar pattern holds for other even @xmath53 .",
    "the bottom - right plot in figure [ fig : ovs ] compares the superposition for @xmath60 depicted in figure [ fig:6pic ] with the ground state for @xmath60 as @xmath13 varies from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    ".,height=48 ]    the fidelity of the superposition in figure [ fig:6pic ] is nt quite as high as it was for @xmath3 but is nevertheless quite high at approximately @xmath63 .",
    "this reinforces the idea that increasing @xmath13 causes the system to become increasingly frustrated with the consequence that the nearest neighbour entanglement decreases .",
    "next we apply the same hypothesis to the case of odd @xmath53 , taking @xmath64 as an illustrative example . in this case , for @xmath0 i.e.  pure ring , one of the spins is unpaired , or frustrated . as @xmath13",
    "is increased , allowing interactions through the central spin , the frustrated spin may pair up with the central qubit is some manner and become less frustrated . in figure [ fig:5pic ]",
    "we depict a superposition of states which represents this idea that the central spin pairs up with an ` outer ' qubit , taking account of the rotational symmetry of the model .",
    ".,width=288 ]    this model in figure [ fig:5pic ] could explain the variation of the entanglement for odd @xmath53 with @xmath13 - as @xmath13 increases the central spin somehow allows all the spins to pair up and form singlets , relieving the frustration . if nearest - neighbour spins are ` singlet - like ' then are more likely to be entangled and thus the nearest - neighbour entanglement rises , as is indeed the case . to provide some confirmation of this hypothesis the ground state of the star - ring combination",
    "can be compared to the superposition depicted in figure [ fig:5pic ] by calculating the fidelity between them .",
    "this fidelity , marked by @xmath59 , is plotted in the top right plot in figure [ fig : ovs ] .",
    "this graph shows that this speculated state is indeed very close the ground state , and in fact , near @xmath65 , _ is _ the ground state .",
    "interestingly , the point at which it exactly becomes the ground state is also the point at which a different energy level takes over , leading to the sudden drop in nearest - neighbour entanglement .",
    "we have shown that the hypothesis that the @xmath2 interaction encourages spins to form singlets not only provides an explanation for the behaviour of the concurrence , but also gives a close approximation to the ground states as evidences by having a fidelity with the ground state approaching 1 .",
    "in this section we first highlight some of the salient observations in the paper :    * in section [ sec : elevelcrossings ] it was pointed out that discontinuities in concurrence occured when the ground state changed . * the behavior of the concurrence as @xmath13 varied in the regions were concurrence varies smoothly is _ not _ due to the crossings of energy levels .",
    "the example of @xmath60 in section [ sec : elevelcrossings ] showed that even though the same energy level was the ground state for for @xmath66 the patterns observed in the concurrence , such as a peak in the next to nearest - neighbour concurrence for @xmath13 slightly greater than @xmath67 still occur . * section [ sec : changingeig ] indicated that the ground state stays ` ring - like ' and ` star - like ' for some time near @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively . *",
    "section [ sec : generalbonds ] gave a reasonable explanation for why the concurrence increases as @xmath13 was increased from @xmath0 for @xmath53 odd and decreased for @xmath53 even based on frustration .",
    "* in the intermediate region , at least for @xmath3 , a ghz state can be produced as a simple derivative of the ground state . * some interesting multiparticle entangled states which can be produced in a star system of spins",
    "can also be produced even when a significant proportion of ring interaction is present on top of the star interaction .",
    "in section [ sec : generalbonds ] we have already given an explanation for the apparently counter - intuitive the rise of the nearest neighbor entanglement on increasing @xmath13 from the ring side for odd @xmath53 .",
    "we now attempt to provide an explanation for the rest of the behavior of the entanglement in the system that we have numerically observed .",
    "this includes the apparently counter - intuitive rise of the next to nearest neighbor entanglement as @xmath13 is decreased in the star region and the vanishing of both nearest and next to nearest neighbor entanglement around @xmath65 .",
    "we will provide the explanation only in the case of @xmath3 , and assume that an analogous argument holds for other @xmath53 . in the case of @xmath3 , we have already provided a mathematical explanation of the behavior of entanglement ( in section[sec : expln4 ] ) by accepting certain numerically observed patterns for the behavior of @xmath68 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is these patterns that we will now explain by taking for granted the numerically observed facts that the coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath20 always remain real and they smoothly change to interpolate between the ground state of the star and the ring as @xmath13 varies .    in the ground state at the star ( @xmath1 ) end ,",
    "the outer spins are in a mixture of fully symmetric states .",
    "this is because the star hamiltonian converts states @xmath69 to @xmath70 ( and @xmath71 to @xmath72 ) and vice versa .",
    "the star interaction thus tends to _ symmetrize _ the state of the outer spins ( _ i.e. , _ impose the same sign on @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and impose an opposite sign to @xmath20 with respect to @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the ground state . on the other hand ,",
    "the ring interaction converts two subparts of a symmetric state ( namely @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) to each other , and thus tends to impose a sign difference between these states in the ground state . indeed",
    "the ground state at the ring end ( @xmath0 ) consists of the state @xmath75 irrespective of the state of the central spin . to _ smoothly interpolate _ between the ground states of the star and the ring by a single ground state , then",
    ", @xmath18 and @xmath19 have to change from being of the same sign to being of opposite signs as one proceeds from the star end to the ring end . in order to do this ,",
    "one of them ( either @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) has to retain its sign and thereby remain opposite in sign to @xmath20 , while the other has to go through zero and reverse its sign . in the star region ,",
    "the effect of the star interaction is strong , and in this region the energy is lowest if @xmath19 , rather than @xmath18 , is maintained to be opposite in sign from @xmath20 .",
    "this is simply because the energy of a state of the type @xmath76 with positive @xmath20 and negative @xmath18 and @xmath19 is lower for a larger proportion of @xmath74 rather than for a larger proportion of @xmath73 .",
    "the value of @xmath18 , which should reverse sign , will thus move towards zero as @xmath13 is decreased from the star end .",
    "this decreases the proportion of @xmath73 in the ground state .",
    "as @xmath73 has nearest neighbors in opposite states , it constructively contributes to the entanglement of nearest neighbors .",
    "if it decreases , so does the nearest neighbor entanglement .",
    "as far as next to nearest neighbor state is concerned , though , @xmath73 contributes only @xmath77 or @xmath78 to the state . from the generic expression ( eq.([concexpression ] ) ) for two spin reduced density matrices for this system , we know that entanglement can only stem from the presence of states @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "so @xmath73 does not contribute positively to next to nearest neighbor entanglement .",
    "on the other hand , it contributes a fraction of unentangled states @xmath81 and @xmath82 to the mixed state of the next to nearest neighbor qubits , which reduces the entanglement in the state .",
    "thus when the fraction of @xmath73 decreases , the part of the state which contributes to next to nearest neighbor entanglement increases due to normalization , thereby increasing this entangelement .",
    "this explains the apparently counterintuitive rise of the next to nearest neighbor entanglement in the star region as @xmath13 decreases .",
    "the decrease in the proportion of @xmath73 in the state , however , increases the energy due to the ring part of the interaction , as this part of the interaction  prefers \" ( _ i.e. , _ lowers the energy of ) states in which nearest neighbors are oppositely aligned .",
    "the energy of the state thus continues to increase as @xmath13 decreases . for @xmath83",
    ", however , it still continues to be the lowest energy state because of the dominance of the star interaction in this region . around @xmath84",
    "the buildup of energy due to decreasing proportion of @xmath73 is not sustainable , and a different pair of states overtake as the ground state .",
    "these states , which signal the start of the intermediate region , are of the form @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this has a significant proportion of @xmath87 , which , because of its similar nature as @xmath73 , lowers the energy due to the ring part of the interaction .",
    "the state of the outer spins corresponding to this state is a mixture of a state @xmath51 , @xmath50 and @xmath87 .",
    "both @xmath87 , and an equal mixture of @xmath51 and @xmath50 , individually have zero nearest neighbor and next to nearest neighbor entanglement , which explains the dropping of all entanglement to zero for a region after @xmath88 ( the intermediate region ) .",
    "the state in the intermediate region still has a significant absolute value of @xmath89 , which plays a role in lowering the energy due to the star part of the interaction .",
    "however , as we approach the end of the intermediate region by decreasing @xmath13 , the star interaction becomes altogether less important , and then it is more important to have a state of the form @xmath90 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 of comparable absolute values but opposite in sign to maximally lower the energy due to the dominant  ring \" part of the interaction . at this value of @xmath13 , the energy level which smoothly interpolates between the ground states of the star and",
    "the ring has assumed precisely such a form ( except for a very small extra fraction of @xmath91 or @xmath92 ) , and becomes the ground state once again .",
    "this indicates the start of the ring region when @xmath13 is decreased .",
    "this paper has demonstrated that the model in which the outer spins can interact through a combination of star and ring type interactions possesses a number of surprising features which make it interesting to study . in this paper",
    "we have shown that both nearest neighbor ( for odd @xmath53 ) and next to nearest neighbor ( for all @xmath53 ) entanglement in the ground state have their maxima for a hamiltonian which is _ neither _ a pure ring _ nor _ a pure star in its interactions .",
    "we have drawn attention to the link between dramatic changes in entanglement and the change in the ground state due to crossing over of energy levels .",
    "the case of four outer spins was analyzed in detail and interpolated ground states given for all values of @xmath13 . by hypothesizing a tendency of the interaction to form singlet states",
    "we have found an explanation for the behavior of the entanglement in the ring region that applies to general values of @xmath53 .",
    "we have found that we can produce a ghz state as a simple derivative of the ground state for @xmath3 .",
    "we have also shown that the multi - particle entangled states producible from a pure star are also producible from in a star system polluted with a significant proportion of ring interaction .",
    "we believe the concept of a combination of interactions by both models is relevant because although it is unlikely to be a naturally occuring structure , experimental implementations of quantum computing , for example using quantum dots , may allow artifical structures to be created where the topology is in fact the combination we have been describing . in that case our results will be useful , especially is situations where there are untunable ( fixed ) interactions .",
    "there are a number of potential avenues for future working stemming from the material described here .",
    "it would be satisfying to be able to expand the range of @xmath53 considered to try to spot broader trends and patterns . indeed to fully describe the model a complete analytical solution would be desirable although this is most likely very difficult to find .",
    "the concept of a network of spins interacting through a combination of two different topologies could perhaps be extended to other structures and dimensions .",
    "recently , it has been shown that spin systems can be used for studying non - markovian dynamics @xcite , optimal quantum cloning @xcite ( where a spin star can be used ) and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the dynamical consequences of spins interacting in a _",
    "combination _ of star and ring geometries .",
