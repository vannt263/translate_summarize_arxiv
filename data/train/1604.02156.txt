    "supersymmetry ( susy ) provides attractive solutions to problems which can not be solved within the framework of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "in particular , the unification of the sm @xmath3 gauge interactions , which is the prediction of the grand unified theory ( gut ) , may be realized if the mass scale of susy particles is of @xmath4 , because three gauge coupling constants meet at @xmath5 using the renormalization group equations ( rges ) of the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) above @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 being the renormalization scale ) .",
    "in addition , the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , if it is neutral , is a good candidate of the dark matter .",
    "although susy sm is theoretically well - motivated , there is no experimental evidence of the existence of susy particles at around tev . on the contrary ,",
    "the lhc is pushing up the possible mass scale of susy particles .",
    "for example , in the simplified scenario , colored susy particles below @xmath8 are excluded @xcite .",
    "in addition , the observed higgs mass of @xmath9 @xcite suggests that the mass scale of the stops is near @xmath10 or higher ( see , for example , @xcite ) in order to enhance the radiative correction to the sm - like higgs mass @xcite.the stop masses of a few tev can also explain the sm - like higgs mass of @xmath9 if the stop - stop - higgs tri - linear coupling constant is sizable @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to consider the possibility that some of the susy particles ( in particular , stops ) are much heavier than tev scale .",
    "one of the theoretically well - motivated scenarios with heavy sfermions is so - called anomaly mediation susy breaking ( amsb ) @xcite or pure gravity mediation ( pgm ) @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , sfermion masses are generated by the effect of supergravity , including direct khler interaction between the sm chiral multiplets and susy breaking fields , while the gaugino masses arise from the effect of anomaly mediation .",
    "then , the sfermion masses can become @xmath11 while the gaugino masses are one - loop suppressed relative to the sfermion masses .",
    "if all the susy breaking fields in the hidden sector have gauge quantum numbers for hidden gauge group responsible for the susy breaking , for example , such a framework naturally shows up .    if we assume the amsb / pgm scenario , we should consider if the motivations of susy , in particular , the unification of the gauge groups and the lsp dark matter , are still viable . for the latter , it has been pointed out that the lsp can be dark matter if the lsp is neutral wino @xcite , which can be realized in a wide parameter region of the amsb / pgm scenario .",
    "in addition , if the mass scale of the sfermions are of @xmath12 , the gauge coupling constants of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 still meet at @xmath5 , which may suggest the successful gut in the amsb / pgm scenario .    as well as the gauge coupling unification ,",
    "one important prediction of gut is the yukawa coupling unification . in particular , in a large class of models ( including simple guts based on @xmath16 gauge group ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are embedded into a single multiplet of the gut gauge group , resulting in the unification of the yukawa coupling constants of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , it is important to check if the @xmath0-@xmath1 unification is viable in the amsb / pgm scenario @xcite . in particular , it is necessary to consider the implication of the higgs mass constraint to the @xmath0-@xmath1 unification . before the discovery of the higgs boson ,",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 unification has been already studied for the case where the masses of susy particles are fairly degenerate and are at the electroweak to tev scale @xcite .",
    "then , in such a case , it has been shown that , for a successful @xmath0-@xmath1 unification , relatively large threshold corrections to the yukawa coupling constant at the mass scale of susy particles are suggested ( assuming that the threshold correction at the gut scale is negligible).after the discovery of the higgs boson , it has been discussed if the @xmath0-@xmath1 unification is successful in the so - called desert scenario in which the mssm consistent with the observed higgs mass of @xmath9 is valid up to the gut scale .",
    "for early attempts , see @xcite .",
    "many of the studies consider , however , the cases where the mass scale of the susy particles are relatively close to the weak scale .",
    "we quantitatively study the @xmath0-@xmath1 unification with hierarchical mass spectrum of the susy particles , accurately calculating the yukawa coupling constants of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the gut scale , taking into account the mass splitting among susy particles .    in this paper , we study the yukawa unification ( in particular , the @xmath0-@xmath1 unification ) in susy @xmath16 gut in the framework of the amsb / pgm scenario . in such a scenario , as we have mentioned , there are several important mass scales , i.e. , the mass scale of sfermions , that of gauginos , and the weak scale ; at these scales , the particle content of the relevant effective theory changes .",
    "for an accurate study of the @xmath0-@xmath1 unification , renormalization group effects should be investigated taking proper effective theory at each scale . in the past",
    ", @xmath0-@xmath1 unification was also studied for the cases where the masses of susy particles are of @xmath11 , but the effects of mass splitting among susy particles were taken into account at the leading logarithmic level @xcite . here",
    ", we solve the relevant rges for each scale , include the threshold corrections , and study @xmath0-@xmath1 unification in the framework of the amsb / pgm scenario .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    ", we introduce the model we consider . in section [ sec : numerical ] , our numerical results are shown . in particular , we calculate the gut scale values of the yukawa coupling constants of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and discuss how well they agree .",
    "implications of our numerical results are discussed in section [ sec : implications ] .",
    "the results are summarized in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "first , let us introduce the model we consider . we consider the amsb / pgm scenario in which scalars as well as higgsinos acquire masses from direct couplings to the susy breaking fields while the gaugino masses originate from the amsb effect",
    "then , we consider three effective theories from the weak scale to the gut scale .",
    "we call these effective theories as sm , @xmath17sm , and mssm .",
    "we consider the case where the masses of the heavy higgses are of the order of the sfermion masses , and hence each effective theory consists of the following particles : we assume that there is no new particle between @xmath18 and @xmath19 which significantly affects the renormalization group runnings of the mssm parameters .",
    "* sm for @xmath20 : sm particles , * @xmath17sm for @xmath21 : sm particles and gauginos , * mssm for @xmath22 : mssm particles ,    where @xmath18 is the mass scale of the sfermions , @xmath23 is the mass scale of gauginos , and @xmath19 is the gut scale which is defined as the scale at which @xmath15 and @xmath14 gauge coupling constants become equal .    in our study , the most important part of the superpotential is denoted asfor notational simplicity , we use same notations for the sm fields and the corresponding superfields . in addition , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 indices are omitted .",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are up- and down - type higgses , respectively , while @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are quarks and leptons in third generation with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 representations of @xmath3 gauge group , respectively .",

    "( the `` tilde '' is used for susy particles . )",
    "some of the lagrangian parameters are related to each other at the gut scale . for the soft susy breaking parameters",
    ", we neglect the threshold corrections at the gut scale .",
    "then , in @xmath16 gut , we parametrize the scalar masses at the gut scale as @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are soft susy breaking mass squared parameters of the sfermions in @xmath47 , @xmath33 , @xmath48 , @xmath35 , and @xmath49 representations of the sm gauge groups , respectively , while @xmath50 and @xmath51 are those of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "( for the sfermion masses , we assume the flavor universality at the gut scale for simplicity . ) in addition , the gaugino masses arise from the amsb effect , and are given by @xcitein the complete formula , the gaugino masses are proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the compensator field in supergravity . if the susy breaking field does not acquire vacuum expectation value as large as the planck scale , however , the vacuum expectation value of the compensator field agrees with the gravitino mass . in the following",
    ", we assume that is the case . @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are gauge coupling constants of @xmath15 , @xmath14 , and @xmath13 gauge groups , respectively , and @xmath56 is the gravitino mass which is taken to be a free parameter in our analysis .",
    "( we use the convention in which @xmath56 is real and positive . )",
    "the tri - linear scalar couplings also obey the amsb relation , and hence are one - loop suppressed relative to @xmath56 .    at the mass scale of @xmath57 ,",
    "the lagrangian parameters as well as the fields in the mssm are matched to those in the @xmath17sm .",

    "notice that , with large @xmath60 , the sign of @xmath66 is determined by @xmath76 .",
    "we also note here that , when @xmath60 is not so large , other contributions to @xmath66 may become comparable to those from the sbottom - gluino and stop - chargino loops .    for the calculation of the gaugino masses ,",
    "we include the threshold correction to the wino and bino masses from the higgs - higgsino loop diagram @xcite : @xmath77 where @xmath78    then , at @xmath79 , the lagrangian parameters in the @xmath17sm are matched to those in the sm .",

    "the lagrangian parameters at the weak scale are related to those at @xmath79 by using sm rges .",

    "importantly , some of the lagrangian parameters are determined by low - energy observables , while boundary conditions for others are set at the gut scale as we have explained in the previous section . in our analysis , they are determined as follows :    * the gauge and yukawa coupling constants are determined by using the data given in @xcite .",

    "the difference between @xmath109 and @xmath110 should be compensated by threshold corrections at the gut scale if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are embedded into the same multiplet of the unified gauge group ; this is the case in simple susy gut models based on @xmath16 ( or other unified gauge groups containing @xmath16 ) . to quantify the @xmath0-@xmath1 unification ,",

    "the possible size of the corrections at the gut scale is strongly model - dependent .    due to the mass splitting of the particles at the gut scale ,",
    "@xmath97 may deviate from @xmath95 .",

    "in addition , @xmath134 is the field responsible for the breaking of @xmath135 ; hereafter , to make our points clearer , @xmath134 is assumed to be in the adjoint representation of @xmath16 .",
    "the superpotential of the form of eq .   may arise from an unknown non - perturbative dynamics at the cut - off scale ( like the planck or string scale , identifying @xmath126 as a cut - off scale ) , or by integrating out particles whose masses are above the gut scale . here , let consider a simple example of the latter .",

    "in such a case , the quarks and leptons , which are embedded into the same @xmath16 multiplet in the simplest scenario , are given by different admixture of the fields at the gut scale or above .",
    "on the contrary , for @xmath156 , @xmath154 is possible even with @xmath157 . in particular , when @xmath60 is not so large , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are much smaller than @xmath95 and hence @xmath158 ( see fig .  [",

    "if the coupling between @xmath137 and first or second generation quarks and leptons is as strong as that to third generation ones , the hierarchy of the sm yukawa coupling constants are easily spoiled .",
