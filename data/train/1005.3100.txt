    "since their discovery , the electronic structure of the high temperature superconductors has been a subject of intensive theoretical attention as well as controversy , a situation that continues even today . a landmark question to understand these materials",
    "is how their physical properties follow from their electronic structure and to which extent simplified descriptions in the form of model hamiltonians describe their basic physical properties in the normal state .",
    "it is generally accepted that the physics of the copper oxide based high temperature superconductor families is captured by the copper - oxygen layers and the relevant degrees of freedom are the copper @xmath0 orbitals and the oxygen p@xmath1 and p@xmath2 orbitals @xcite .",
    "numerous studies have demonstrated that this model captures qualitatively the physics of the copper oxide planes .",
    "however , there have been several proposals that the p@xmath3 oxygen orbitals and the d@xmath4 copper orbital play an important role in the onset of orbital current order @xcite or for the existence of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "seeking a simpler low energy description , several studies have shown that the hubbard model describes some _ qualitative _ properties of the copper oxygen layers .",
    "however , the precise energy range over which the description is valid and the quality of this description for different physical observables , is still a subject of active research .",
    "a related question is hence how to map the copper oxide layers onto the various effective hamiltonians and what is the effective strength of the coulomb correlations in these systems .",
    "there are various approaches tackling this issue , ranging from ab - initio methods to model hamiltonian studies .",
    "the theoretical studies usually consist of a two stage process : in the first step ab - initio approaches use an approximate technique , such as constrained dft in the lda or gga approximation , or quantum chemical methods , to derive the parameters and the form of the effective hamiltonian . in the second step , model hamiltonian",
    "based approaches compute various observables in the framework of a given model hamiltonian and given approximation technique .",
    "the parameters entering the model hamiltonians are determined by comparing the results side by side with experiment .",
    "numerous research efforts notwithstanding , even the basic question of the strength of the correlations in the copper oxide materials and the origin of the insulating gap in their parent compound has not been fully elucidated .",
    "there are two opposing physical pictures describing the origin of the insulating gap in these materials . in the so called slater picture ,",
    "the insulating behavior is understood as the result of a doubling of the unit cell caused by antiferromagnetic long range order . in the so called mott picture ,",
    "the insulating behavior is the result of the local blocking of the electron propagation due to the strong coulomb repulsion . in the latter picture ,",
    "the insulating behavior originates from the localization of the electron and is not tied to any specific form of magnetic long range order .",
    "hence antiferromangetic long range order arises as a secondary instability . in the presence of magnetic long range order ,",
    "the unit cell is doubled and the two pictures , slater and mott , are continuously connected : no physical observable can provide a sharp distinction between the two , both magnetic order and blocking contribute to the insulating behavior .",
    "mean field theory treatments allow to study the paramagnetic state as an underlying _ normal state _",
    "mean field solution , which can supports a sharp transition between a paramagnetic metal and a paramagnetic insulator .",
    "this solution is not realized when other more stable mean field solutions supporting long range order exist , but within a mean field framework , it can still be used to draw a sharp distinction between slater insulators and mott insulators , by investigating if the ordered state is derived from a metallic or an insulting paramagnetic solution .",
    "the pioneering work of zaanen sawatzky allen @xcite and their sharp ( so called zsa ) boundary between charge transfer metals and charge transfer insulators can be viewed in this light .",
    "a simple argument can be formulated for the hubbard model to estimate the strength of the correlation of cuprates . within a one band hubbard description , parametrized by a bandwidth @xmath5 and a coulomb repulsion u",
    ", the insulating gap of the paramagnetic insulator is @xmath6 and the super - exchange is @xmath7 . for cuprates ,",
    "the gap is around @xmath8ev and @xmath9ev , and therefore it is found that the repulsion is of the order @xmath10 , which is above but not far from the mott boundary @xmath11 , and hence the cuprates are in a regime of intermediate correlation strength .",
    "conclusions on the placement of cuprates in a regime of intermediate correlation strength were also reached by numerical studies ( for a review see for example ref .  ) .",
    "the strength of the correlations was also studied in the three band theory . in particular ,",
    "large n slave boson mean field theory of a three band model ( with no oxygen - oxygen transfer integrals ) @xcite of the copper oxides obtained a sharp transition between the metal and the charge transfer insulator in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "this metal - to - charge - transfer - insulator transition parallels the brinkman rice transition in the hubbard model .",
    "it was found that there is indeed a correspondence between the two critical coulomb repulsions of the hubbard model @xmath12 ( the minimal coulomb repulsion that supports the paramagnetic insulator ) and @xmath13 ( the minimal repulsion that does not support a paramagnetic metal ) with the two critical charge transfer energies @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where the paramagnetic insulating state and the paramagnetic metallic state are destroyed , respectively . the critical value of the charge transfer energy in the three band theory ( @xmath15 ) plays the role of the critical u ( @xmath13 ) of the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "although a strong particle - hole asymmetry is expected in the three band theories , since doped electrons reside mainly on copper sites while doped holes reside mainly on the oxygen sites , it was shown that the resulting quasiparticle band structure was surprisingly particle - hole symmetric . indeed , it is due to the strong copper - oxygen hybridization which results in the formation of zhang - rice singlets and to the quasiparticles that involves copper spin and oxygen charge .",
    "other more realistic treatments of the three band description of the copper oxides were carried out within the slave boson framework .",
    "some include the oxygen dispersion @xcite @xcite , additional copper and oxygen orbitals , short range magnetic correlations @xcite , the nearest neighbor coulomb interactions or the electron phonon coupling . within slave boson mean field theory of the three band model ,",
    "the parent compound of hole doped cuprates lsco was located close but above ( i.e. on the insulating side of ) the metal to charge transfer insulator transition boundary @xcite .",
    "the development of dynamical mean field theory @xcite and their extensions @xcite opened new avenues to advance our qualitative understanding of the electronic structure of the cuprates and its quantitative description .",
    "dmft goes beyond slave bosons theories : this method treats both coherent and incoherent features on the same footing , whereas slave bosons theories are not able to capture the coherent character of the physical solution .",
    "dmft successfully describes the mott transition of the hubbard model and gives a deeper understanding of the brinkman rice transition @xcite .",
    "single site dmft calculations can also be extended to more precise cluster calculations .",
    "in particular , cluster corrections in dmft allow to assess the validity of the single site calculations .",
    "the question of the strength of the correlations was also addressed by dmft studies of multi - band model hamiltonians for the copper oxides planes @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram , with respect to the charge transfer energy and the coulomb repulsion of the copper orbitals was studied .",
    "the boundary between the metallic and the charge - transfer - insulator solutions was located , as well as the crossover line between the charge - transfer - insulator and the mott insulator .",
    "a full phase diagram of a copper oxide model , and a very complete analogy with the dmft studies of the mott transition in the hubbard model was also performed recently @xcite .",
    "combination of dmft with electronic structure methods , such as lda , allow to combine the ab - initio and the model hamiltonian viewpoint in the lda+dmft framework .",
    "the lda+dmft method @xcite allow in particular to determine the strength of correlations for specific materials , like ncco and lsco , and there are still several important issues unresolved regarding how this picture is connected to the cuprates : a ) how should the different materials be placed in the qualitative zsa phase diagram .",
    "should the parent compounds of the copper oxide materials be thought as slater or mott / charge transfer insulators , b ) what significant differences are there in the different level of description , mainly what are the differences between the one band and three band theory , c ) what is the quality of the description of the various experimental observables , for the different low energy models involving a different number of bands , and finally d ) can one obtain a consistent picture of the spectroscopies of hole and electron doped cuprates using a first principles method .    in regards to point a ) ,",
    "the issue is still under debate .",
    "using the analysis of model hamiltonians , refs @xcite classify the parent compounds of electron and hole doped compounds as slater insulators in the metallic side of the zsa phase diagrams .",
    "previous lda+dmft studies classified lsco @xcite as a mott insulator ( or more precisely as a charge transfer insulator ) , and ncco was identified as slater insulator . on the other hand ,",
    "the first principles study of @xcite found ncco s parent compound to be mott insulator .",
    "finally , the phenomenological analysis of experimental data in ref @xcite concludes that the analysis of the optical data requires comparable strength of interactions in hole and electron doped cuprates .    in regards to point b )",
    "the energy range over which the spectral functions of the three band model are reproduced by the one band model is also subject of controversy .",
    "for example , refs .",
    "@xcite assert that the three band model and a one band model of the copper oxides are quantitatively equivalent up to a scale of 4ev , while a similar analysis by a. macridin et al .",
    "concludes that the range of validity of the hubbard model is much smaller , and is of the order of 0.5 ev @xcite .",
    "an additional controversy , regarding the differences between the one band and the three band theory , is connected to the values of the insulting gap in the paramagnetic insulator . in particular , in a one band theory near @xmath13 , the gap of the paramagnetic solution is substantially smaller then the gap of the antiferromagnetic solution for the same parameters @xcite .",
    "this is not the case in the three band model where antiferromagnetism increases the value of the paramagnetic insulating gap by less than @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the latter statement is controversial with respect to ref @xcite , which argued that the one band model and the three band model are similar in their physics up to energies as large as twice the gap .    regarding point c ) , many authors used the theoretical results obtained with the hubbard model to fit experiments .",
    "for instance ref .",
    "@xcite considered a treatment of the hubbard model with variational cluster perturbation theory ( vcpt ) .",
    "it could match experiments but it required a sensible dependence of the hubbard u on the level of doping . on the other hand , an approximate diagrammatic treatment of the one band model",
    "@xcite indicates that the experimental optical spectra and the dispersion @xcite can be reproduced without a doping dependent u.    note that a three band lda+dmft study was able to describe the experimental data of ncco without having to invoke doping dependent parameters .",
    "moreover , using the same technique , a successful description of both the integrated optical weights and the magnitude of the optical conductivity below the charge transfer gap for lsco and ncco was obtained @xcite .",
    "this approach however does not give the correct magnitude of the optical conductivity of lsco for energies of the order of the charge transfer gap , suggesting that additional orbitals might play an important role in lsco .",
    "in this paper we reconsider these issues building on our earlier work of refs and .",
    "we use an ab - initio approach , e.g. the local density approximation combined with the dynamical mean field theory ( lda+dmft ) @xcite to study the electronic structure of ncco and lsco .",
    "the comparative study of two typical cuprate compounds lsco and ncco allow us to place firm bounds ascertaining the importance of correlations in the cuprates .",
    "the good agreement between theory and experiments , achieved using single site lda+dmft within a multiband framework , for two different compounds , is a significant results and illustrates the power of this new first principles approach to correlated materials .",
    "our results contrast with a recent phenomenological analysis of optical data , of electron and doped cuprates : they concluded that for a one band theory , vertex corrections beyond single site dmft were required to obtain a reasonable fit to experiments @xcite .    in this work , we include also the apical oxygens and an additional copper orbital ( d@xmath4 ) , which were not included in our previous study of lsco @xcite .",
    "this extends the quantitative agreement between theory and experiments to a broader energy range .",
    "it sheds light on why the three band model description of ncco agrees with experiments up to larger energy scales than for lsco .",
    "ncco , in the t structure , lacks apical oxygens and is therefore well described by the three band model up to a much higher energy scale , justifying the excellent agreement between theory and experiment found in ref @xcite .",
    "we confirm that for integration cutoffs smaller than half the gap of the parent compound , the additional apical oxygen degrees of freedom do not affect the integrated optical weights in lsco .",
    "this validates the analysis carried out in ref @xcite to extract the strength of correlations in these materials , which was based on analysis up to an energy scale of half the charge transfer gap , i.e. 1 ev . the apical oxygens however substantially affects the shape of the optical conductivity and it strongly modifies the optical conductivity of lsco around 2 ev .",
    "while the hole occupancy of the @xmath17 orbital is small , it has a clear effect on the optical conductivity of the hole doped cuprates .",
    "we show here that within the first principles lda+dmft framework , extensions of the model to include further orbitals or longer range correlations ( using cluster extension ) consistently improves precision of the calculation and improves agreement with experiments .",
    "the organization of our paper is the following . in section 1",
    "we describe the phase diagram of ncco and lsco within single site and two site cluster dmft , and highlight the role of magnetic order and singlet correlations in these materials . in section 2",
    "we present the evolution of the angle resolved photoemission spectra ( arpes ) of these materials , stressing the various features of the theory that require a description beyond static mean field theory and its comparison with the experiments .",
    "details regarding the formula used in section 2 to compare the spectral weight with experiments are given in appendix a. section 3 focuses on the optics and how the evolution of the optical properties with doping and temperature in ncco and lsco can be understood as the result of placing the two compound on two different sides of the zsa boundary , once the band structure of both materials is taken into account .",
    "the inclusion of the apical oxygens in the theoretical modeling is important to obtain correct results for various physical quantities , including the shape of the optical conductivity and the integrated optical spectral weights with a cutoff of the order of the charge transfer gap .",
    "we also discuss the connection of the optical conductivity with various features in the arpes spectra , and compute the occupation of the different orbitals which are relevant to the xas spectra .",
    "there is one parameter , the double counting correction , whose determination in the lda+dmft approach is not unique .",
    "we thus examined in the last section the dependence of our results on this parameter and used this dependence to estimate the proximity of both ncco and lsco to the zsa boundary .",
    "the tight binding parametrization obtained makes contact with model hamiltonian studies and is reported in appendix b. we conclude with some outlook for further work .",
    "lda+dmft uses first principles density functional theory methods to extract the hopping parameters of the model , which is subsequently solved using dmft and its extensions .",
    "the lda calculation was carried out with the pwscf package @xcite , which employs a plane - wave basis set and ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite .",
    "downfolding to a three band model , containing copper d@xmath18 and two oxygen p@xmath19 orbitals was performed by the maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwf ) method @xcite .",
    "the downfolded lda band structure of nd@xmath20cuo@xmath21 ( ncco ) and la@xmath22cuo@xmath21 ( lsco ) ( see appendix b ) results in the following three band hamiltonian : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 label the cuo@xmath20 unit cells of the lattice , and @xmath26 are the hopping matrix elements . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the on - site energies of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 orbitals , respectively . finally , we note that the charge transfer energy @xmath31 plays the same role as u in the single band hubbard model , as seen for example in slave bosons mean - field studies @xcite .    to this hamiltonian",
    ", we add the onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath32 on the d@xmath18 orbital @xmath33 where the value of @xmath34 .",
    "the lda+dmft method , accounts for the correlations which are included in both lda and dmft by a double counting correction to the @xmath29-orbital energy , @xmath35 , which amounts to a shift of the relative positions of the d and p orbitals .",
    "here we take @xmath36 to be the occupancy of the correlated orbital in the parent compound , which gives the double counting corrections @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) for ncco ( lsco ) .",
    "the lda downfolded parameters are shown in table [ table : lda_param ] , which we find to be close to those extracted by other first principles methods .",
    "an extended 6-band model , that considers the @xmath39 , @xmath17 and @xmath40 orbitals , was also considered for lsco .",
    "the 6-band hamiltonian is : @xmath41 the hopping parameters @xmath42 were obtained by downfolding the lda band structure to six orbitals ( @xmath43,@xmath39,@xmath44,@xmath45 ) .",
    "the double counting for the 6-band model is defined as @xmath46 . the same on - site",
    "repulsion @xmath47 was considered for the d@xmath18 and d@xmath4 orbitals .    .",
    "lda band calculations gives us different set of parameters for lsco , ncco and pcco compounds .",
