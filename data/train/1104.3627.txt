    "in theories with extra dimensions our universe is conceived inside of a geometrical structure with more than four dimensions . in this context , we find the brane world models , where the fundamental interaction fields are confined on a brane in the four - dimensional transition region between two spacetimes with different curvatures . in particular , the gravitational fluctuations are characterized by a ground state localized around the brane and by a massive tower of unbounded states which generate corrections to the four - dimensional term in the gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "these configurations can be determined either as vacuum solutions to the einstein equations rigidly connected on the four - dimensional transition region @xcite ; or as self - gravitating solutions to the coupled einstein - scalar field system , where the scalar field is a topological kink interpolating between the minima of a potential with spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "the energy density of these solutions is associated to a wall which divides the spacetime into two portions whose curvatures are identified with the extrema of the scalar potential . then , in the thin wall limit of the self - gravitating wall the brane is obtained @xcite .    in both cases ,",
    "it is possible to consider de - sitter ( ds ) scenarios with metrics similar to the friedmann - robertson - walker solution @xcite , where the ds brane , unlike the static cases , could be the boundary between two flat spaces or , in more general cases , with positive curvatures .",
    "however , only when the vacua are negatives or anti de - sitter ( ads ) the standard four - dimensional potential is recovered on the brane @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "asymmetric ds scenarios where the brane interpolates between different vacua ; e.g. , ds - ads , such that the gravity is confined in an unusual way , have been studied in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the corrections to the four - dimensional term in the gravitational potential have not yet been analyzed ; and it is interesting to determine if only a negative vacuum is sufficient to recover newtonian gravity on any four - dimensional sector of the asymmetric scenario considered there .    in order to determinate the deviations to the newtonian potential in an asymmetric scenario , the existence of a resonant mode inside of the spectrum of gravitational fluctuations must be considered . in the static case , its contribution to the gravitational potential on the brane was first analyzed in @xcite , and more recently in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the dynamics case the analysis has not yet been done ; and it is our intention to address this issue throughout this paper . for this , we will identify a set of integrability conditions for the gravitational fluctuations similar to those found in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    ", we shall find a five - dimensional family of ds vacuum solutions to the einstein equations with arbitrary cosmological constants at each side of the brane . in section [ grares ] , the corrections to the newtonian potential generated by the massive tower of the gravitational excitations",
    "will be determined , considering several scenarios with ads@xmath0 vacua and taking into account the possible effects produced by the resonant modes .",
    "finally , we will present our conclusions in section [ diss ] .",
    "we consider a five - dimensional structure , where @xmath1 is the extra coordinate , generated by two spacetimes with arbitrary curvatures connected rigidly on the hypersurface @xmath2 .",
    "the metric tensor of the scenario is given by @xmath3 such that @xmath4 which can be determined as a three - brane solution to the einstein field equations @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the brane tension .",
    "in particular , consider the embedding of a thin ds brane into a five - dimensional bulk described by a metric with planar - parallel symmetry , with associated line element @xmath9 where @xmath10 and with tension given by @xmath11    for the particular case @xmath12 where the symmetry around the brane is defined by @xmath13 , the metric factor ( [ f1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath14 and the metric tensor ( [ g ] , [ g0 ] ) can be identified with the thin wall limit of the self - gravitating wall given by ( [ g ] ) and @xmath15 where @xmath16 $ ] is the hypergeometric function and @xmath17 is the thickness of the wall .",
    "the spacetime ( [ g ] , [ f-1 ] ) was determined in @xcite , it corresponds to a scenario where the zero mode of gravity fluctuations is confined on the four - dimensional transition region between the spaces with cosmological constants ( [ cttecosml2 ] ) .",
    "notice that in the null curvature limit , @xmath18 , ( [ f1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath19 which is the metric factor of the ds thin wall found in @xcite , whose self - gravitanting version was reported initially in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "in the static limit , @xmath20 , when @xmath21 , ( [ g ] , [ f1 ] ) consistently converges to the rs-2 scenario @xcite in conformal coordinates @xmath22    we will analyze the gravitational interaction on the four - dimensional sector of the spacetime ( [ g ] , [ f1 ] ) .      in order to determinate",
    "the spectrum of the gravitational fluctuations of ( [ g ] , [ f1 ] ) , consider small perturbations , @xmath23 , in the transverse and traceless sector .",
    "thus , in the axial gauge , @xmath24 , and under the usual decomposition , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , we have ( @xmath27 index omitted ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30    the eigenfunctions of ( [ sch ] , [ vqm ] ) are determined by a zero mode localized around the brane , @xmath31 with @xmath32 and a continuos tower of massive modes propagating freely for the five - dimensional bulk . by defining @xmath33 and @xmath34\\ ] ]",
    "we have , for @xmath35 @xmath36,\\label{modosmasivos-}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for @xmath37 @xmath38,\\label{modosmasivos+}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the normalization and integration constants respectively , to be determined from the integrability conditions of the problem ( [ sch ] , [ vqm ] ) .",
    "notice that , in correspondence with ( [ vqm ] ) , the massive modes are separated from the bound state by a mass gap of @xmath41 , which is a generic property of the ds scenarios .    according with @xcite , any eigenvalue of ( [ sch ] , [ vqm ] )",
    "is associated to two wave functions identified as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which satisfy @xmath44 and @xmath45 together with @xmath46    thus , the four integration constants for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , can be determinate by ( [ saltoc0 ] , [ saltoc ] ) and ( [ ortonormal ] ) in the first case ; and by ( [ saltod0 ] , [ saltod ] ) and ( [ ortonormal ] ) in the second one .",
    "notice that the orthonormality condition ( [ ortonormal ] ) is divergent for all @xmath47 , which is a problem that can be solved by introducing two regularity branes at @xmath48 @xcite , such that the initial scenario is recovered in the limit @xmath49 . as consequence of the regulatory branes , the potential ( [ vqm ] ) is modified and now exhibits , besides the well , two infinite height barriers , @xmath50 and the massive modes satisfy the following integration condition @xmath51 additional to ( [ saltod ] ) . in the limit @xmath49 , from ( [ cuantiz ] ) , is obtained that the massive tower is approximately quantized in units of @xmath52 .    in the quasi - static regimen of the ds scenario ( [ g ] ) ;",
    "i.e. , @xmath53 , the set of regularized states is used to determinate the gravitational potential between two massive particles separated by a distance @xmath54 on the physical brane .",
    "thus , we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the planck mass in five - dimensions and @xmath57 .",
    "in analogy with the standard cosmology , @xmath58 in ( [ g ] ) is the hubble constant , around @xmath59yr@xmath60 ; and as a result , those configurations associated to a ds@xmath0 spacetime are similar to those scenarios embedded in a five - dimensional flat bulk ( remember that @xmath61 ) ; where , unlike the ads@xmath0 scenarios , the gravitational interaction on the brane has a five - dimensional behavior @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to consider the effects generated for the asymmetry on the newtonian potential , we will focus in the asymmetric cases with ads@xmath0 vacua .    about these scenarios",
    ", we must highlight the existence of resonant massive modes at @xmath2 ; i.e. , massive states with a probability greater than others to be on the brane . in fig.[reso ] the behavior of @xmath62 for different values of @xmath63",
    "is shown , where @xmath64 ; such that , @xmath65 at left side of the figure , while @xmath66 at right side of the figure . in accordance with fig.[reso ]",
    ", in the first case , the resonant mode mass decreases when the asymmetry increases ; unlike to the second case , where the resonant mode mass increases for large @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in any case , it turns out that the resonant mass , for @xmath69 , is approximately given by @xmath70^{1/4},\\ ] ] such that it is bounded as follows @xmath71    notice that the upper bound and lower bound in ( [ cotareso ] ) , are given by @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .            due to the exponential term in ( [ vn ] )",
    ", we expected that the effective deviations to the newton law are generated by the light modes ; in such a way that , the resonance contribution is negligible for those scenarios where the resonant mode belongs to the heavy states set .",
    "however , in those scenarios where the resonant mode is lightweight , its contribution to the gravitational potential ( [ vn ] ) must be analyzed .",
    "in fact , as a consequence of the mass gap in ( [ vqm ] ) , in the scenarios where @xmath65 , the increase of the asymmetry does not discourage the localization of the zero mode and a newtonian term in ( [ vn ] ) is expected even when @xmath74 .",
    "next , we will determine the gravitational potential on three asymmetric ads@xmath0 scenarios , where the integral in ( [ vn ] ) is always saturated at @xmath75      consider the almost symmetric scenario @xmath76 , where the resonant mode is absent .",
    "so , to first order in @xmath77 , the integration constants are given by @xmath78 and the spectrum of the gravitational fluctuations is reduced to @xmath79 and @xmath80.\\label{mass1}\\ ] ]    substituting ( [ cero1 ] ) and ( [ mass1 ] ) in ( [ vn ] ) , we have @xmath81\\right]\\label{v(r)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and newtonian gravity is recovered on the brane when @xmath82    on the other hand , for @xmath83 , consistently the newtonian potential in the @xmath84 case is obtained @xcite .",
    "now , for large @xmath67 and @xmath68 , but @xmath85 , the integration constants are determined as follows @xmath86 and the corresponding density of states are given by @xmath87 and @xmath88    after evaluating ( [ vn ] ) , we obtain @xmath89;\\label{vadsads}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and four - dimensional gravity is once again recovered , but in this case , in the region @xmath90    now , comparing ( [ cotareso ] ) and ( [ cota2 ] ) , we find that the resonant mode is a heavy state whose contribution , along with the contribution of other heavy modes , is suppressed for the exponential factor in ( [ vn ] ) .      in accordance with ( [ cotareso ] ) , to include the resonant mass within ( [ cotam ] ) @xmath74 is required . in this case @xmath91 , and from ( [ n0 ] ) we have @xmath92 which is a positive and finite quantity for arbitrary @xmath93 ; and a bound zero mode is obtained even when one of the portions of the five - dimension spacetime is flat , in correspondence with the mass gap in ( [ vqmf2 ] ) . additionally , notice that in the static case @xmath94 and only when the bulk is ads@xmath0 the gravity is localized on the brane , as expected .",
    "let us analyze the effect of the light resonant mode on the gravitational potential ( [ vn ] ) .",
    "for @xmath74 , the integration constants are determined by @xmath95\\frac{m}{m_0 } , \\\\",
    "b_-&\\simeq&\\frac{8}{33}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left(\\frac{k_-}{m}\\right)^5}\\left[-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(6 + 7\\frac{m_0}{m}\\right)\\frac{m_0}{m}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\   & & + \\left.\\frac{1}{11}\\left(52 - 9\\frac{m_0}{m}\\right)\\frac{m}{k_-}\\right]\\frac{m}{m_0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and it follows that @xmath96    thus , we find that the gravitational potential is given by @xmath97;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that , the contribution of the resonant mode is of the @xmath98 form and five - dimensional potential , @xmath99 , appears as the dominant potential in the region @xmath100    therefore , when one of the vacua is null , newtonian gravity is not feasible on the brane .",
    "we analyzed the gravitational interaction on a five - dimensional asymmetric ds spacetime .",
    "the configuration was generated by connecting rigidly at @xmath2 two vacuum solutions to the einstein equations with planar - parallel symmetry and different curvatures . as a result , on the four - dimensional transition region",
    "a ds brane is obtained .",
    "consistently , the spacetime has a null curvature limit equal to ds solution studied in @xcite ; and a static limit , with symmetric ads@xmath0 vacua , similar to the rs-2 scenario @xcite .",
    "we focus on the scenarios with negative curvature , because , unlike the cases with curvature positive or zero , the gravitational interaction on the brane is of the four - dimensional form @xcite .",
    "it turns out that for a given asymmetric scenario , it is possible to find a resonant mode inside of the spectrum of gravitational fluctuations .",
    "we noted that , in those scenarios where @xmath65 , its mass decreases with the increases of asymmetry ; while , in those scenarios characterized by @xmath66 , its mass increases with the increases of asymmetry . in any case , the resonant mass remains bounded between the cosmological constants values at each side of the brane .    in the ads@xmath0 scenarios where @xmath66 , the resonant mode belongs to the heavy states set and its contribution to the gravitational potential on the brane",
    "is exponentially suppressed , in such a way that newtonian gravity is recovered on any four - dimensional sector of the scenarios . on the other hand , in order to include the resonant mode inside the light modes set , we explored the scenario ads@xmath0-flat . in the dynamics case , although one of the vacua is null , the zero mode of gravitational fluctuations is normalizable and an interaction newtonian term is recovered in the gravitational potential . however , due to the resonant mode correction , five - dimensional gravity is obtained on the brane .",
