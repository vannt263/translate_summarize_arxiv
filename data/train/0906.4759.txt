    "the do ( helium - rich ) white dwarf kpd  0005 + 5106  is the hottest known white dwarf star .",
    "its effective temperature was measured to be 120,000  k by @xcite , and recently revised upward to 200,000  k by @xcite based on the detection of lines in its spectrum .",
    "subsequently , @xcite identified emission from in its uv spectrum , the highest ionization stage of any element observed in a stellar photosphere . weak x - ray emission at 1 kev detected with the _ rosat _  pspc has been interpreted as evidence for a hot ( @xmath2 k ) , fast , perhaps shock - heated wind , though it may be photospheric @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the star is surrounded by an optical nebula , visible in [ ]  @xmath05007 emission , roughly 3  in diameter .",
    "they find that the nebula contains about 70  m@xmath3 of material , and argue that this large mass implies that the material must be interstellar rather than circumstellar .",
    "closer in , @xcite discovered bright , diffuse  @xmath4 emission extending at least 3.5  from the star .",
    "the @xcite study is based on data from 15 lines of sight observed with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ between 2001 and 2003 .",
    "kpd  0005 + 5106  was observed as a calibration target throughout the _ fuse _  mission , and spectra of half a dozen additional sight lines are now available . meanwhile , the _ fuse_data - reduction software has evolved considerably , particularly with the release of calfuse v3 .",
    "the revised effective temperature of the white dwarf , the new data , and the improved calibration pipeline motivated us to re - examine the nature of the  emitting nebula around kpd  0005 + 5106 .",
    "_ fuse _ consists of four coaligned spectrographs . two employ optics coated with al+lif and record spectra over the wavelength range 9901187  ; the other two use sic coatings and are sensitive to wavelengths below the lyman limit .",
    "the four channels overlap between 990 and 1070  .",
    "each channel has three apertures that simultaneously sample different parts of the sky .",
    "the low resolution ( lwrs ) aperture is 30  @xmath5 30  in size .",
    "the medium resolution ( mdrs ) aperture is 4  @xmath5 20  and lies about 3.5  from the lwrs aperture .",
    "the 1.25  @xmath5 20  high - resolution ( hirs ) aperture lies midway between the mdrs and lwrs apertures .",
    "a fourth location , the reference point ( rfpt ) , is offset from the hirs aperture by about 1 .",
    "when a star is placed at the reference point , all three apertures sample the background sky . for a complete description of _ fuse",
    "_ , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to identify observations for this study , we searched the multimission archive at space telescope ( mast ) for _ fuse _ observations of kpd  0005 + 5106  obtained through the mdrs , hirs , or rfpt apertures , for which the lwrs aperture should sample the background sky . because its sensitivity at 1032   is more than twice that of any other channel",
    ", we consider only data from the lif 1a channel .",
    "we use data obtained in time - tag mode , which preserves arrival time and pulse - height information for each photon event . our final sample , consisting of data obtained along 21 lines of sight ,",
    "is presented in table [ tab_observations ] ; the location of each sight line is plotted in figure  [ fig_map ] .",
    "our sight lines now range over more than 180  around the star .",
    "the data were reduced using an implementation of calfuse v3.2 , the final version of the _ fuse _ data - reduction software package @xcite , optimized for faint , diffuse emission .",
    "details are given in @xcite , but we highlight a few points here : the program operates on one exposure at a time , producing a flux- and wavelength - calibrated spectrum from each .",
    "background subtraction is turned off .",
    "zero - point errors in the wavelength scale are corrected by fitting a synthetic emission feature to the ly@xmath6 airglow line .",
    "the spectra from individual exposures are shifted to a heliocentric wavelength scale and combined .",
    "finally , the spectra are binned by 14 pixels ( 53 km s@xmath7 ) , a value chosen so that two binned pixels just span a diffuse emission feature .    to improve the statistical significance of our results ,",
    "we combine spectra with the lowest signal - to - noise ratios with those of adjacent sight lines , as noted in table [ tab_intensities ] .",
    "the resulting spectra are fit with a synthetic  @xmath8 emission feature using the non - linear curve - fitting program specfit @xcite .",
    "the model consists of a top - hat shaped function 106 km s@xmath7  in width , representing the lwrs aperture , convolved with a gaussian , representing the instrument line - spread function ( @xmath9 25 km s@xmath7 ) convolved with the intrinsic emission - line profile .",
    "free parameters in the fit are the level and slope of the background ( assumed linear ) and the amplitude , central wavelength , and fwhm of the gaussian .",
    "our model fits yield line intensities with @xmath10 for 14 spectra .",

    "( 1lu = 1  photon  s@xmath7@xmath11sr@xmath7 . ) a fit to the sum of all 14 spectra yields an intensity of @xmath12 klu , a line width of @xmath13  km s@xmath7 , and a local standard of rest velocity @xmath14 km s@xmath7 .",
    "individual lines of sight show considerable scatter about the mean velocity .",

    "the asymmetric shapes of some model emission features are artifacts of our sparse sampling of the model lines .",
    "there are two caveats .",
    "first , these observations are relatively short . to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio of our spectra",
    ", we use all of the data , including that obtained during orbital day . to test for contamination by geocoronal emission @xcite , we repeat the analysis , using only data obtained during orbital night .",
    "we find that , in all cases for which the night - only spectrum has significant exposure time ( @xmath19 s ) , the day - plus - night and night - only line intensities agree within the night - only uncertainties .",
    "second , we do not attempt to fit the fainter component of the  doublet at 1038  .",
    "it is only half as bright as the 1032   line ( in an optically - thin medium ) and may be blended with interstellar * @xmath20 or geocoronal @xmath21 .",
    "the reddening toward kpd  0005 + 5106 , @xmath22 = 0.06 (  3.1 ) , reduces the observed  intensity by @xmath955% @xcite .",
    "the line intensities presented in figure  [ fig_map ] and table  [ tab_intensities ] are not corrected for this extinction .",
    "the stellar spectrum shows strong absorption from molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath23 absorption feature most likely to overlap the  @xmath01032 emission line is the lyman ( 6,0 ) @xmath24 transition at 1032.35   .",
    "its velocity , @xmath25  km s@xmath7(j .",
    "kruk , private communication ) , places it some 100  km s@xmath7  from the velocity of the summed  emission features derived above .",
    "assuming that both the  emitting and h@xmath23 absorbing gas are photoexcited and have low turbulent velocities , then their intrinsic line widths should be about 10  km s@xmath7  ( a value consistent with the 30  km s@xmath7  width of the summed  feature , which includes the instrumental line spread function ) . the  emission and h@xmath23 absorption features are thus well separated .    our results generally agree with those of @xcite . where they differ , our intensities tend to be lower .",
    "examples are sight lines s4044403 and m1070224 ( map keys s43 and m24 ) , which @xcite fit separately , obtaining intensities of @xmath26 and @xmath27 klu , respectively . because the intensity of the m24 feature is poorly constrained in our fits ,",
    "we combine the two spectra and obtain a best - fit intensity of @xmath28 klu .",
    "for sight line m1070223 , the difference is more extreme : our intensity of @xmath29 klu is half of the @xmath30 klu reported by @xcite , though their value is poorly constrained .",
    "note that , for most lines of sight , @xcite use only data from the nighttime portion of the orbit .",
    "a star with an effective temperature of 200,000  k is expected to produce a significant amount of high energy radiation , capable of ionizing oxygen up to o@xmath31 .",
    "thus , the  emission we detect around kpd  0005 + 5106  is most likely from gas photoionized by the star .",
    "we explore the conditions in the nebula by running photoionization models .",
    "the calculations , described in detail in  3.2 , were performed with version 08.00 of cloudy , last described by @xcite .",
    "we require the models to reproduce two observational results : the `` typical ''  intensity and the spatial extent of the [ ] emission detected by @xcite .",
    "as we will show , these conditions place strong constraints on the incident flux and on the density of the emitting gas .",
    "we do not seek to explain the distribution of the  emission , nor the variations in its intensity ( figure  [ fig_map ] ) , using these model calculations .",
    "first , we discuss the stellar parameters of kpd  0005 + 5106 , including its distance .",
    "the latter is necessary for obtaining the spatial scales of the emitting regions .      in their initial analysis of kpd  0005 + 5106 , @xcite",

    ", the 3.5 radius of the outer set of _ fuse _ sight lines ( figure  [ fig_map ] ) corresponds to a physical extent of 0.27 pc .",
    "the detection of absorption features in the _ fuse _ spectrum of kpd  0005 + 5106  requires an upward revision of its effective temperature .",
    "@xcite find that the lines are best fit by models with @xmath32 = 180,000  200,000 k and @xmath35 .",
    "subsequently , emission lines were identified in the _ fuse _ spectrum , and fits to these lines yield @xmath32 = 200,000  220,000 k and @xmath36 @xcite . for both species ,",
    "the best - fit value of the surface gravity rises with effective temperature .",
    "@xcite point out that the star s lines , in both the uv and the optical , are better fit by a model with @xmath32 = 200,000 k and @xmath37 than by the original @xmath32 = 120,000 k , @xmath33 model .",
    "k. werner has kindly provided us with a synthetic spectrum of the star .",

    ", we can estimate both the star s interstellar reddening and its distance .",
    "we begin by scaling the synthetic spectrum according to the reddening law of @xcite for various values of the color excess @xmath22 .",
    "we scale the result to match the star s v - band flux . finally , we compare the predicted and observed flux at 1060   in the _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "we find that the _ fuse _ data are best fit by @xmath39 , a value similar to the @xmath40 derived by @xcite from _ iue _ data .    as @xcite point out , an effective temperature @xmath32 = 200,000 k and a surface gravity @xmath41 place kpd  0005 + 5106 on the @xmath42 post - agb evolutionary track of @xcite .",
    "adopting this mass and surface gravity , we derive a radius @xmath43 . the scale factor required to make the reddened model ( at 5500  ) match the star s v - band flux is sf = @xmath44 .",
    "given the star s radius and this scale factor , its distance is simply @xmath45sf @xcite , or @xmath46 pc . at this distance",
    ", the 1.75 radius of the inner set of _ fuse _ sight lines corresponds to @xmath9 0.42  pc ( @xmath47  cm ) , the 3.5  radius of the outer set corresponds to @xmath9 0.84  pc ( @xmath48  cm ) , and the 1.5radius of the [ ]  nebula corresponds to @xmath9  21  pc ( @xmath49  cm ) .",
    "we repeat the calculations using a second synthetic spectrum ( also provided by k. werner ) with @xmath32 = 180,000 k and @xmath50 . scaling the model to match the observed v - band and 1060fluxes",
    ", we derive a color excess @xmath39 , which is the same as for the hotter model . assuming the same stellar mass as before",
    ", we derive a distance to the star of 780 pc .",
    "small changes in the surface gravity affect the stellar radius , but do not significantly alter the overall shape of the emergent continuum . a star with @xmath32 = 200,000 k and @xmath51 would have a radius of @xmath52 , which is about 40% larger than that for @xmath41 .",
    "the luminosity would therefore be greater by about 90% ( since @xmath53 ) , and the derived distance to the star would increase to 1.2 kpc .",
    "cloudy is a versatile code that can be used to calculate the ionization structure and emission from photoionized gas under a broad range of conditions .",
    "our models for the  nebula detected by _ fuse _  are relatively simple .",
    "we assume an ionization - bounded slab of uniform density illuminated by the white dwarf .",
    "the main input parameters are the shape of the ionizing continuum , the incident flux on the cloud surface , the density structure of the gas , and the elemental abundances in the gas .",
    "calculations are performed in one dimension assuming spherical symmetry ; however , the effective geometry can be made plane parallel by choosing a large radius of curvature .    in our models ,",
    "the abundances of elements are held fixed .",
    "we use the default solar values as specified in cloudy : c and o from allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) ; n , ne , mg , si and fe from @xcite ; and the rest from @xcite . we take the @xmath32 = 200,000 k synthetic spectrum of kpd  0005 + 5106  as the shape of the incident continuum .",
    "( in  3.2.2 we use the @xmath32 = 180,000 k spectrum to study how the results depend on the effective temperature of the star . ) the incident flux and the gas density are allowed to vary (  3.2.3 ) .    the physical distance from the star to the nebula scales with the distance from the star to the earth .",
    "the stellar distance is derived by scaling the model spectrum to match the observed fluxes in the v - band and at 1060   .",
    "therefore the flux normalization at the nebula does not depend directly on the distance between us and the star , but rather on the stellar flux observed at earth and the angular separation between the star and the inner face of the nebula , which we take to be 1.7 .",
    "we first explore the case of the unattenuated stellar continuum incident on the  emitting nebula .",
    "the inner face of the nebula is assumed to be 1.7 from the star , placing it just within the inner set of _ fuse _ observations ( clearly it can be no further away ) .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of @xmath54  cm at 820 pc .",
    "the normalization of the continuum may be described in terms of the flux of photons with energy greater than or equal to 113.9  ev , which is the energy required to ionize o@xmath55 to o@xmath31 .",
    "( this ionization energy corresponds to a photon frequency of about @xmath56  hz . ) from the synthetic spectrum of kpd  0005 + 5106 , we find that the luminosity of such high - energy photons is @xmath57 photons  s@xmath7 .",
    "the flux of these photons at the inner face of the nebula is @xmath58  photons  s@xmath7  @xmath11 . for this initial model ,",
    "we choose a hydrogen number density of 1  @xmath1 , which is a typical value for the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the calculations predict that the  emitting zone extends about 20  kpc , and that the  @xmath01032 emissivity is about @xmath59  erg  s@xmath7  @xmath1 over most of the region .",
    "@xmath01032 is a resonance line , and the cloudy predictions of emissivity take into account radiative transfer effects via the escape probability formalism .",
    "although the escape probabilities are calculated for a one - dimensional slab , we assume that the predicted emissivity holds for our observed lines of sight , which lie perpendicular to the direction of the stellar flux vector through the model nebula .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the path length through the nebula is about @xmath60  cm , which is roughly equal to the extent of the  emission in the plane of the sky ( about 5.7 , the distance between sight lines m08 and m23 in figure  [ fig_map ] ) . using these values , we find that the expected intensity from the model nebula is @xmath61 erg s@xmath7 @xmath11 sr@xmath7 .",
    "a color excess @xmath39 (   3.1 ) toward kpd  0005 + 5106  corresponds to an extinction at 1032  of about a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the model predicts that the observed intensity would be about @xmath62 erg s@xmath7 @xmath11 sr@xmath7 , which equals about 13,000  lu .",
    "this value is consistent with the _ fuse _  observations .",
    "although this model reproduces the observed  intensity , it does not correctly reproduce the extent of the optical nebula . in the model , the [ ]",
    "emission arises beyond the , at a distance of between 20 and 32  kpc from the star .",
    "this is about three orders of magnitude larger than the @xmath63  pc radius of the [ ]  nebula detected by @xcite .",
    "the lower limit on the effective temperature of kpd  0005 + 5106  is 180,000 k. we calculate a model using the @xmath32 = 180,000 k synthetic spectrum to examine the sensitivity of the nebular properties to the stellar effective temperature .",
    "all other model parameters remain unchanged from the initial model .",
    "the luminosity of o@xmath55 ionizing photons is @xmath64 photons  s@xmath7 , about half that of the 200,000 k stellar spectrum .",
    "their flux is @xmath65  photons  s@xmath7  @xmath11 at the inner face of the nebula .",
    "the  zone extends about 12 kpc , just over half the distance predicted by the 200,000 k model .",
    "the total  flux from the 180,000 k model nebula is only half that of the 200,000 k model .",
    "however , the intensity in the inner few kpc is about 20% higher .",
    "this is because more of the o@xmath31 ions are ionized to o@xmath66 by the 200,000 k spectrum than the 180,000 k spectrum .",
    "the [ ] emission arises at a distance of between 12 and 22 kpc from the star .",
    "this is still almost three orders of magnitude larger than the observed radius of the optical nebula .",
    "if the effective temperature of kpd  0005 + 5106  were at the lower limit allowed by the lines , the unattenuated flux impinging on gas at typical interstellar densities would still produce an optical nebula much larger than observed .",
    "if the temperature were at the higher limit ( 220,000 k ) , the discrepancy would be increased . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we consider only the best - fit 200,000 k synthetic spectrum for kpd  0005 + 5106 .",
    "we ran a grid of models using the @xmath32 = 200,000 k synthetic spectrum for the continuum shape , varying the incident flux level and the density of the emitting gas .",
    "the incident flux levels ranged from the unattenuated stellar continuum used in the initial model down to one - tenth this value .",
    "( the latter corresponds to @xmath67  o@xmath55 ionizing photons  s@xmath7  @xmath11 . )",
    "the hydrogen number densities ranged from 1  @xmath1 to 100  @xmath1 .    for models",
    "in which the continuum is unattenuated , a gas density @xmath68 of about 40  @xmath1 is required to produce an [ ] nebula with a radius of about 20  pc . in that case",
    ", however , the predicted  intensity is over 200 times the observed value .",
    "as the incident flux is lowered , the density required to reproduce the observed radius of the [ ]  nebula also decreases . for each such combination , the predicted  intensity decreases with incident flux and density , matching the observed values only when the incident flux is @xmath9  10% of the unattenuated value .",
    "the corresponding hydrogen density in the gas is 10  @xmath1 .",
    "we take this to be the fiducial model for the nebula around kpd  0005 + 5106 .    in figure  [ fig_model ]",
    "we plot the predicted emissivities of , [ ] , and h@xmath69 against depth into the cloud .",
    "the average  emissivity out to a few parsec is about @xmath70  erg  s@xmath7  @xmath1 .",
    "this emissivity is slightly higher than that predicted by the initial model and , under the same assumptions used above , yields an observed intensity of 17,300  lu .",
    "the  nebula would be visible out to a few parsecs , i.e. beyond the outer ring of _ fuse",
    "_  observations .",
    "the [ ]  emissivity falls rapidly beyond about 24  pc , and the h@xmath69 emissivity extends slightly beyond 26  pc .",
    "the total [ ]  to h@xmath69 flux ratio is about 6 .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion of @xcite that the h@xmath69 nebulosity associated with the nebula around kpd  0005 + 5106  is faint compared with the [ ] .",
    "the presence of photoionized  emission around a hot white dwarf is not unexpected .",
    "as shown by our model calculations , a 200,000  k star can maintain oxygen in this highly ionized state out to a distance of several kiloparsecs for typical ism gas densities and can produce the observed  @xmath01032 intensity .",
    "( a similar point was made by @xcite , who showed that uv radiation from hot white dwarfs can maintain the presence of c@xmath71 in the galactic halo . )",
    "the puzzling result is that , in order to produce the observed  emission and an [ ]  emitting zone confined to a radius of @xmath72  pc , the ionizing continuum must be attenuated by about 90% between its emergence from the stellar surface and its incidence on the inner face of the nebula . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss how this attenuation may be explained by the presence of circumstellar material around the white dwarf .",
    "the prior evolution of kpd  0005 + 5106   and in particular its mass - loss history  are unknown .",
    "however , the star is expected to be surrounded by material lost while it was on the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "we make the assumption that a shell of material surrounds the star and examine the effect of such a shell on the stellar continuum .",
    "to do so , we calculate cloudy models with the kpd  0005 + 5106(@xmath32 = 200,000 k ) spectrum impinging on a shell and compare the emergent continuum with the incident .    from the @xcite evolutionary track",
    ", we estimate that kpd 0005 + 5106 left the asymptotic giant branch some 2000 years ago , after ejecting its outer envelope .",
    "we thus fix the inner radius of the shell to be @xmath73 cm , the distance traveled in 2000 years by material moving at a typical pn expansion velocity of 20 km s@xmath7 . assuming that envelope ejection took a few thousand years , we fix the outer radius of the shell at three times the inner radius . the density , assumed to be uniform ,",
    "is treated as a variable parameter .",
    "abundances are fixed at the solar values .",
    "we find that the continuum above 113.9 ev is attenuated by about 90% when the density of the gas in the shell is n@xmath74 = 3500 @xmath1 .",
    "the total mass in the shell ( assuming that it covers 4@xmath75 steradians ) is then @xmath9 0.4 @xmath76 , comparable to the 0.2 @xmath76 typical of planetary nebulae .",
    "the shape of the emergent spectrum differs from that of the kpd  0005 + 5106synthetic spectrum in several ways .",
    "there is a sharp decrease at the edge at 54.4  ev from which the spectrum begins to recover at @xmath77  ev .",
    "while the o@xmath55 ionizing continuum is reduced by 90% , the continuum between 54.4  ev and 100  ev is reduced by over 99% . the continuum between 13.6  ev and 54.4  ev",
    "is reduced by only about 70% .",
    "we next calculate a cloudy model of the nebula using this emergent spectrum propagated out to the inner face of the nebula ( @xmath47  cm from the star ) .",
    "as described above , the shell density is chosen such that the flux of o@xmath55 ionizing photons incident on the nebula is the same as that for the fiducial model .",
    "the hydrogen density in the nebula is 10  @xmath1 , also equal to that in the fiducial model .",
    "the difference in the shape of the continuum has an impact on the predicted properties of the photoionized nebula .",
    "the resulting model has an  zone that extends out to only about 2  pc , which is much smaller than that predicted by the fiducial model ( figure [ fig_model ] ) , but still extends beyond the outer ring of _ fuse _  observations ( figure [ fig_map ] ) .",
    "the intensity in the inner 1  pc ( which encompasses the _ fuse _  sight lines ) , however , is about 3 times that of the fiducial model .",
    "the [ ]  zone extends out to 45  pc , about twice that predicted by the fiducial model ( and thus about twice the observed extent of the optical nebula ) .",
    "the  intensity and the extent of the [ ]  zone can be brought closer to the observed values if the flux emergent from the shell is reduced by an additional 32% , such that there are @xmath78  o@xmath55 ionizing photons  s@xmath7  @xmath11 impinging on the nebula . a model with this lower flux yields an  zone extending about 2  pc from the star ( as above ) .",
    "the  intensity in the inner 1  pc is within 5% of that predicted by the fiducial model , and the [ ]  zone extends out to about 28  pc .    the gas density in the shell , its inner and outer radii , and the abundances of elements are all unconstrained parameters of the models .",
    "additionally , the nebular gas density may be adjusted . because there are no independent observational constraints on the putative circumstellar shell around kpd  0005 + 5106 ,",
    "more detailed calculations are not warranted .",
    "we have shown ( in  3.2 ) that in order to explain the  and [ ]  observations of the nebula around kpd  0005 + 5106 , the stellar flux must be attenuated .",
    "we have shown that this attenuation can be achieved by a shell of gas with properties consistent with mass loss from the star while on the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "we have further shown that the emergent spectrum is capable of photoionizing a nebula and producing the observed  and [ ]  emission . however",
    ", we do not make any attempt to model both the shell and the nebular emission self - consistently .",
    "a shell such as the one we have assumed would produce its own emission .",
    "to our knowledge , there has not been a careful examination of the region around the star at sufficiently high resolution to place strong limits on any such emission .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig_map ] that the  emission has an azimuthal structure , with the faintest emission from the southern and northwestern edges of our sample and the brightest towards the southwest .",
    "the pattern is as clearly seen in table  [ tab_intensities ] , where the intensities exhibit a monotonic increase followed by a monotonic decrease going around the inner and outer rings .",
    "the only exception is sight line m34 .",
    "the m34 value may be less reliable than the others because it has the shortest exposure time and is barely a @xmath79 detection .",
    "if we ignore m34 , then all the sight lines outside of the cone between lines connecting the white dwarf and m09 on one side and m24 on the other have  intensities less than or equal to 9.5  klu . within this cone , all sight lines have  intensities greater than or equal to 14.5  klu . at the edges of the cone ,",
    "only the inner ring shows the brighter ; m08 and m23 are fainter ( figure  [ fig_map ] )",
    ".    the observed distribution of the  intensities could be due to an azimuthal dependence of either ( i ) the gas density in the nebula or ( ii ) the incident ionizing flux .",
    "we examine the conditions necessary for each of these alternatives , restricting ourselves to the predictions from one - dimensional models with uniform gas density .    for a given incident flux ,",
    "the ionization parameter ( ratio of ionizing photon density to gas density ) decreases with increasing density , while the emission measure increases with increasing density .",
    "thus , there is some value of density at which the emissivity peaks .",
    "our fiducial model assumes a gas density of 10  @xmath1 . raising the density to 15",
    "@xmath1 reduces the emissivity by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "if the density is 20  @xmath1 , then the emissivity falls by a factor of 2.2 .",
    "these emissivities yield observed intensities ( under the path length assumptions used in  3.2 ) of 11.5  klu and 7.9  klu , respectively .",
    "higher - density models also predict smaller and brighter [ ]  nebulae than the fiducial model does , but no obvious azimuthal structure is seen in the [ ]  images presented by @xcite . a model with a density of 1  @xmath1 predicts an  emissivity that is half the value of the fiducial model , but is ruled out because its [ ]  zone extends to 2  kpc .",
    "if the gas density is fixed , then a lower incident flux will yield fainter  emission .",
    "an incident flux 90% that of the fiducial model results in a factor of 1.4 drop in the  intensity .",
    "if the incident flux is 80% that of the fiducial model , then the intensity drops by a factor of just over 2 .",
    "these values correspond to observed intensities of 12.5  klu and 8.5  klu respectively .",
    "the [ ]  intensity and the extent of the [ ]  emitting region are not strongly affected by changes in the incident flux ",
    "they change by factors of less than 20% among these models .",
    "spatial variations in the flux incident upon the  emitting nebula could be achieved by moderate density variations in the circumstellar shell around kpd  0005 + 5106 . for example , in the shell considered in  4.1 , if the density were 4000  @xmath1 rather than 3500  @xmath1 , then the o@xmath55 ionizing continuum would be attenuated by about 98% , rather than 90% .",
    "the circumstellar shell is not an opaque object casting a shadow , but a source of diffuse radiation , with considerable angular extent when viewed from any point on the inner face of the nebula .",
    "therefore we can not simply infer the azimuthal structure of this shell based on the observed distribution of  intensities . calculating the radiative transfer through the circumstellar shell to derive the incident continuum at each point in the nebula",
    "is beyond the scope of this work .    of the two alternatives for explaining the observed azimuthal distribution of  emission , the latter , i.e. , ionizing flux variations , is the one that has less effect on the distribution of [ ]  emission",
    "therefore , we suggest that it is the more straightforward explanation .",
    "one implicit assumption in all of our models is that the  and [ ]  arise in a single nebula with uniform density .",
    "this need not be the case . the mass loss of stars on the asymptotic giant branch is a complex process ; in the case of kpd  0005 + 5106 , up to 2  m@xmath3 may have been lost over a period of @xmath80  years prior to the final mass ejection that resulted in the circumstellar shell we have inferred in  4.1 . if such were the case , then it would be necessary to consider ( at least ) an outer region of circumstellar material and the interstellar medium as independent emitting regions .",
    "one may then naively expect that all the  arises in the former , while the [ ]  emission is dominated by the latter .",
    "without further data , detailed explorations of such a scenario are premature .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a new analysis of the  @xmath01032 emission around the hot helium - rich white dwarf kpd  0005 + 5106 . at the time of our earlier analysis @xcite",
    ", the star was believed to have an effective temperature of 120,000  k and lie at a distance of 270  pc . since then",
    ", the effective temperature of the star has been revised @xcite , and consequently its inferred distance has increased to 820  pc (  3.1 ) .",
    "we have modeled our  measurements and the [ ]  @xmath05007 emission around the star @xcite as a photoionized nebula .",
    "we have used a synthetic spectrum of kpd  0005 + 5106  for the ionizing continuum and treated the nebula itself as a uniform , one - dimensional slab .",
    "based on the comparison of models with data , we have inferred the existence of a circumstellar shell between the star and the emitting nebula that attenuates the stellar flux by about 90% .",
    "we find that the nebula has a density of @xmath81  @xmath1 .",
    "the distribution of  intensities on the plane of the sky shows a clear azimuthal structure .",
    "this structure may be due to a variation either of the gas density or of the incident flux . within the framework of our simple models , we present the conditions under which we may expect the observed  intensity distribution for each alternative .",
    "we find that variations in the density would affect the brightness and the extent of the [ ]  nebula in ways that probably would be observable , but which are not seen .",
    "however , a more careful examination of the optical emission with accurate photometry is required before any definitive statement can be made .",
    "the  intensity is more sensitive to variations in the incident flux , and the observed differences can be explained without affecting the properties of the predicted [ ]  emission .",
    "our results clearly highlight the need for a thorough examination of the region around kpd  0005 + 5106 .",
    "one possible tracer of high ionization gas is [ ]  @xmath03426 .",
    "our cloudy models predict that the strength of this line is about 10 times that of  @xmath01032 .",
    "a photometric , narrowband imaging study of the nebula in [ ]  and [ ] emission would yield diagnostic information about the distribution of material and the ionization structure of the nebula .",
    "we have inferred the existence of a circumstellar shell based on the synthetic spectrum of kpd  0005 + 5106  and photoionization models for the nebular emission .",
    "its existence is plausible considering the evolutionary history of stars on the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "a direct observation of such a shell would be of great value .",
