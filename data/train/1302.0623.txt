    "the idea of movable hamburg beam pipes is quite simple  @xcite : a larger section of the lhc beam pipe than the usual one can move close to the beam using bellows so that the detectors located at its edge ( called pocket ) can move close to the beam by about 2.5 cm when the beam is stable ( during injection , the detectors are in parking position ) . in its design ,",
    "the predominant aspect is the minimization of the thickness of the portions called floor and window ( see fig .",
    "[ figa ] ) . minimizing",
    "the depth of the floor ensures that the detector can go as close to the beam as possible allowing us to detect protons scattered at very small angles , while minimizing the depth of the thin window is important to keep the protons intact and to reduce the impact of multiple interactions .",
    "two configurations exist for the movable beam pipes : the first one at 206 m form the atlas interaction point hosts a si detector ( floor length of about 100 mm ) and the second one ( floor length of about 700 mm ) the timing and the si detectors .",
    "the purpose of the tracker system is to measure points along the trajectory of beam protons that are deflected at small angles as a result of collisions .",
    "the tracker when combined with the lhc dipole and quadrupole magnets , forms a powerful momentum spectrometer .",
    "silicon tracker stations will be installed in hamburg beam pipes ( hbp ) at @xmath3 206 and @xmath3 214 m from the atlas .",
    "the key requirements for the silicon tracking system at 220  m are :    * spatial resolution of @xmath4 10 ( 30 ) @xmath5 m per detector station in @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) * angular resolution for a pair of detectors of about 1  @xmath5rad * high efficiency over the area of 20  mm @xmath8 20  mm corresponding to the distribution of diffracted protons * minimal dead space at the edge of the sensors allowing us to measure the scattered protons at low angles * sufficient radiation hardness in order to sustain the radiation at high luminosity * capable of robust and reliable operation at high lhc luminosity    the basic building unit of the afp detection system is a module consisting of an assembly of a sensor array , on - sensor read - out chip(s ) , electrical services , data acquisition and detector control system . the module will be mounted on the mechanical support with embedded cooling and other necessary services .",
    "the sensors are double sided 3d 50@xmath8250 micron pixel detectors with slim - edge dicing built by fbk and cnm .",
    "the sensor efficiency has been measured to be close to 100% over the full size in beam tests .",
    "a possible upgrade of this device will be to use 3d edgless silicon detectors built in a collaboration between slac , manchester , oslo , bergen ... a new front - end chip fe - i4 has been developed for the si detector by the insertable b layer ( ibl ) collaboration in atlas .",
    "the fe - i4 integrated circuit contains readout circuitry for 26 880 hybrid pixels arranged in 80  columns on 250  @xmath5 m pitch by 336 rows on 50 @xmath5 m pitch , and covers an area of about 19 mm @xmath8 20 mm .",
    "it is designed in a 130 nm feature size bulk cmos process .",
    "sensors must be dc coupled to fe - i4 with negative charge collection .",
    "the fe - i4 is very well suited to the afp requirements : the granularity of cells provides a sufficient spatial resolution , the chip is radiation hard enough ( up to a dose of 3  mgy ) , and the size of the chip is sufficiently large that one module can be served by just one chip .",
    "the dimensions of the individual cells in the fe - i4 chip are 50 @xmath5 m @xmath8 250 @xmath5 m in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions , respectively .",
    "therefore to achieve the required position resolution in the @xmath6-direction of @xmath4 10 @xmath5 m , six layers with sensors are required ( this gives 50/@xmath9/@xmath10 @xmath5 m in @xmath6 and roughly 5 times worse in @xmath7 ) .",
    "offsetting planes alternately to the left and right by one half pixel will give a further reduction in resolution of at least 30% .",
    "the afp sensors are expected to be exposed to a dose of 30  kgy per year at the full lhc luminosity of 10@xmath11@xmath12s@xmath13 .",
    "a fast timing system that can precisely measure the time difference between outgoing scattered protons is a key component of the afp detector .",
    "the time difference is equivalent to a constraint on the event vertex , thus the afp timing detector can be used to reject overlap background by establishing that the two scattered protons did not originate from the same vertex as the the central system .",
    "the final timing system should have the following characteristics  @xcite :    * 10 ps or better resolution ( which leads to a factor 40 rejection on pile up background ) * efficiency close to 100% over the full detector coverage * high rate capability ( there is a bunch crossing every 25 ns at the nominal lhc ) * enough segmentation for multi - protin timing * level trigger capability    figure  [ fig5_timesys ] shows a schematic overview of the first proposed timing system , consisting of a quartz - based cerenkov detector coupled to a microchannel plate photomultiplier tube ( mcp - pmt ) , followed by the electronic elements that amplify , measure , and record the time of the event along with a stabilized reference clock signal .",
    "the quartic detector consists of an array of 8@xmath84 fused silica bars ranging in length from about 8 to 12 cm and oriented at the average cerenkov angle .",
    "a proton that is sufficiently deflected from the beam axis will pass through a row of eight bars emitting cerenkov photons providing an overall time resolution that is approximately @xmath14 times smaller than the single bar resolution of about 30 ps , thus approaching the 10 ps resolution goal .",
    "prototype tests have generally been performed on one row ( 8 channels ) of 5 mm @xmath8 5 mm pixels , while the initial detector is foreseen to have four rows to obtain full acceptance out to 20 mm from the beam .",
    "the beam tests lead to a time resolution per bar of the order of 34 ps .",
    "the different componenets of the timing resolution are given in fig .",
    "[ timresol ] .",
    "the upgraded design of the timing detector has equal rate pixels , and we plan to reduce the the width of detector bins close to the beam , where the proton density is highest .    at higher",
    "luminosity of the lhc ( phase i starting in 2019 ) , higher pixelisation of the timing detector will be required . for this sake , a r&d phase concerning timing detector developments based on sipms , apds , quartz fibers ,",
    "diamonds has been started in saclay . in parallel , a new timing readout chip has been developed .",
    "it uses waveform sampling methods which give the best possible timing resolution .",
    "the aim of this chip called sampic  @xcite is to obtain sub 10 p timing resolution , 1ghz input bandwidth , no dead time at the lhc , and data taking at 2 gigasamples per second .",
    "the cost per channel is estimated to be of the order for 10 $ which a considerable improvement to the present cost of 10,000 $ per channel , allowing us to use this chip in medical applications such as pet imaging detectors .",
    "the holy grail of imaging 10 picosecond pet detector seems now to be feasible : with a resolution better than 20 ps , image reconstruction is no longer necessary and real - time image formation becomes possible  @xcite .",
