    "since the discovery of the @xmath5 in 2003 @xcite , the charmonium and charmonium - like spectrum are being continuously enlarged with new so - called @xmath6 states @xcite , many of which do not fit properly in the conventional quark models @xcite . the relevance of meson - meson channels can be grasped from the fact that all the charmonium states predicted below the lowest hidden - charm threshold ( @xmath7 ) have been experimentally confirmed , but above this energy most of the observed states can not be unambiguously identified with any of the predicted charmonium @xmath8 states .    amongst the @xmath6 states ,",
    "the @xmath3 was simultaneously discovered by the besiii and belle collaborations @xcite in the @xmath9 reaction , where a clear peak very close to the @xmath10 threshold , around @xmath11 , is seen in the @xmath12 spectrum .",
    "later on , an analysis @xcite based on cleo - c data for a different reaction , @xmath13 , confirmed the presence of this resonant structure as well , although with a somewhat lower mass .",
    "the besiii collaboration @xcite has also reported a resonant - like structure in the @xmath14 spectrum for the reaction @xmath15 at different @xmath16 center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energies [ including the production of @xmath17 .",
    "this structure , with quantum numbers favored to be @xmath18 , has been cautiously called @xmath19 , because its fitted mass and width showed some differences with those attributed to the @xmath3 .",
    "whether both set of observations correspond to the same state needs to be confirmed , though there is a certain consensus that this is indeed the case , and the peaks reported as the @xmath19 and @xmath3 are originated by the same state seen in different channels .",
    "moreover , evidence for its neutral partner , @xmath20 , has also been reported @xcite .",
    "the nature of the @xmath21 is intriguing .",
    "on one hand , it couples to @xmath22 and @xmath12 , and therefore one assumes it should contain a constituent @xmath23 quark  anti - quark pair . on the other hand ,",
    "it is charged and hence it must also have another constituent quark  anti - quark pair , namely @xmath24 ( for @xmath25 ) . its minimal structure would be then @xmath26 , which automatically qualifies it as a non-@xmath27 ( exotic ) meson . being a candidate for an exotic hidden charm state ,",
    "it has triggered much theoretical interest .",
    "an early discussion of possible structures for the @xmath21 was given in ref .",
    "the suggested interpretations cover a wide range : a @xmath14 molecule  @xcite , a tetraquark @xcite , an object originated from an attractive @xmath28 interaction @xcite , a simple kinematical effect  @xcite , a cusp enhancement due to a triangle singularity @xcite , or a radially excited axial meson @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that this structure can not be a kinematical effect and that it must necessarily be originated from a nearby pole .",
    "consequences from some of these models have been discussed in ref .",
    "the non - compatibility ( partial or total ) of the properties of the @xmath29 deduced in different approaches clearly hints why the actual nature of this state has attracted so much attention .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , theoretical basis of the present manuscript , a @xmath30@xmath22 coupled - channels scheme was proposed to describe the observed peaks associated to the @xmath4 , which is assumed to have @xmath31 quantum numbers .",
    "isotriplet . ] within this coupled channel scheme , it was possible to successfully describe simultaneously the besiii @xmath32 @xcite and @xmath22 @xcite invariant mass spectra , in which the @xmath3 structure has been seen .",
    "interestingly , two different fits with similar quality were able to reproduce the data . in each of them , the origin of",
    "the @xmath3 was different .",
    "in the first scenario , it corresponded to a resonance originated from a pole above the @xmath22 threshold , whereas in the second one the structure was produced by a virtual pole below the threshold ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "hadron interactions are governed by the non - perturbative regime of qcd and , for this reason , lattice qcd ( lqcd ) is an essential theoretical tool in hadron physics . in particular ,",
    "one of the aims of lqcd is to obtain the hadron spectrum from quarks and gluons and their interactions ( see _ e.g. _",

    "for such a purpose the lscher method @xcite is widely used .",

    "final state interactions among the outgoing @xmath37 and @xmath30 produce the peaks observed by the besiii collaboration , which are associated to the @xmath4 state .",
    "the two channels involved in the @xmath38 @xmath0-matrix are denoted as @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "solving the on - shell version of the factorized bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) allows to write : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the c.m .",
    "energy of the system .",
    "the symmetric @xmath43 matrix is the potential kernel , whose matrix elements have the following form : @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 the masses of the particles of the @xmath47th channel and @xmath48 , the relative three - momenta squared in the c.m .",

    "thus and for the sake of generality , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite allows for an energy dependence in eq . , driven by the @xmath65 parameter . the @xmath66 matrix in eq",
    "is diagonal , and its matrix elements are the @xmath30 and @xmath22 loop functions , @xmath67 which account for the right - hand cut of the @xmath0-matrix , that satisfies in this way the optical theorem .",
    "the @xmath22 channel loop function @xmath68 is computed in the non - relativistic approximation .",

    "@xcite ) .      in this subsection , we study the previous coupled channel @xmath0-matrix in a finite volume .",
    "the consequence of putting the interaction in a box of size @xmath78 with periodic boundary conditions is that the three - momentum is no longer a continuous variable , but a discrete one . for each value of @xmath78",
    ", we have the infinite set of momenta @xmath79 , @xmath80 . the integrals in eqs . and",
    "will be replaced by sums over all the possible values of @xmath81 : @xmath82 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix in a finite volume is then : @xmath83 where the @xmath84 matrix elements are given by eqs .   and .",
    "the discrete energy levels in the finite box are given by the poles of the @xmath85-matrix .",
    "if the interaction is switched off , @xmath86 , the free ( or non - interacting ) energy levels are given by the poles of the @xmath87 functions , @xmath88 where we use the shorthand @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "the effect of the interaction is to shift these non - interacting energy levels .",
    "our purpose is to make contact with the results reported in the lqcd simulation of ref .",

    "@xcite are actually the result of applying the following shift : @xmath118 where the spin - average mass @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 .",
    "for this reason , we will also present our energy levels shifted as in eq .  .",
    "the parameters involved in our calculations , taken from refs .",
    "@xcite , are collected in table [ table : lattice - parameters ] . in particular",

    "with all the ingredients presented in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : form_fv ] , we can compare our predictions for the energy levels in a box with those reported in ref .",
    "but before presenting our results we would like to discuss some technical details concerning two differences that could affect the comparison .    first , we would like to note that the lqcd simulation in ref .",
    "@xcite includes the @xmath30 and @xmath22 channels that are present in our @xmath0-matrix analysis , but it also includes other channels ( like @xmath123 or @xmath124 ) .",
    "however , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , it is sufficient to include the @xmath1 and @xmath22 channels to achieve a good reproduction of the experimental information concerning the @xmath4 . for this reason , we expect that , in first approximation , these other channels could be safely neglected in the calculations .",
    "the second point to be noted is that we are ignoring the possible @xmath125 dependence of the parameters in the potential , eq .  . nonetheless , the lqcd simulation of ref .",
    "@xcite is performed for a relatively low pion mass , @xmath126 , and we thus expect the eventual dependence to be mild . furthermore , we are going to compare several sets of these parameters ( presented in table  [ table : c - parameters ] ) , which somewhat compensates this effect .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : energy_levels ] , we show the @xmath78 dependence of some energy levels close to the @xmath22 threshold . they have been computed from the poles of the finite volume @xmath85-matrix , eq .  , by using the parameters of table  [ table : c - parameters ] for @xmath127 , and the lattice setup given in table  [ table : lattice - parameters ] .",
    "the levels obtained in the @xmath3 resonance ( virtual ) scenario , calculated using the entries of the first ( third ) row of table  [ table : c - parameters ] , are displayed in the left ( right ) panel .",
    "the blue dashed lines stand for the @xmath30@xmath22 coupled - channel - analysis results , and the red solid lines show the energy levels obtained when the inelastic @xmath30@xmath22 transition is neglected ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "this latter case corresponds to consider a single , elastic channel ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the error bands account for the uncertainties on the energy levels inherited from the errors in the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , quoted in table  [ table : c - parameters ] ( statistical and systematical errors are added in quadrature for the calculations ) .",
    "the green dashed ( dotted - dashed ) lines stand for the non - interacting @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) energy levels . in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_levels-500 ] , the same results are shown but for the case @xmath129 . the qualitative @xmath78 behavior of both figs .",
    "[ fig : energy_levels ] and [ fig : energy_levels-500 ] is similar , so we discuss first fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_levels ] and , later on , the specific differences between them will be outlined .    for both resonant and virtual scenarios ,",
    "there is always an energy level very close to a free energy of the @xmath1 state , @xmath130 , which reveals that the interaction driven by this meson pair is weak .",
    "furthermore , the energy levels for the coupled ",
    "channel @xmath85-matrix basically follow those obtained within the elastic @xmath22 approximation , except in the neighborhood of the @xmath1 free energies .",
    "this also corroborates that the role of the @xmath1 is not essential .",
    "let us pay attention to the levels placed in the vicinity of the @xmath22 threshold . for simplicity , we first look at the single elastic channel case .",
    "there appears always a state just below threshold , as it should occur since we are putting an attractive interaction in a finite box . as the size of the box increases , and",
    "since there is no bound state in the infinite volume limit ( physical case ) , this level approaches to threshold .",
    "when the @xmath1 channel is switched on , the @xmath131behaviour of this level will be modified , specially when it is close to a discrete @xmath1 free energy .",
    "note that the slopes of the @xmath30 free levels , in the range of energies considered here , are larger ( in absolute value ) than those of the @xmath77 ones , because the threshold of the @xmath1 channel is far from the region studied .    from the above discussion",
    ", one realizes that the next coupled channel energy level , located between the two @xmath2 free ones ( @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) , could be more convenient to extract details of the @xmath3 dynamics . indeed , in the resonance scenario",
    ", this second energy level is very shifted downwards with respect to @xmath133 , since it is attracted towards the @xmath29 resonance energy . ) , the @xmath29 resonance mass , ignoring errors , is @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) for @xmath127 ( @xmath136 ) , as seen from table  [ table : c - parameters ] . for @xmath137 as used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and taking into account the shift in eq .",
    ", one might estimate that mass to be around @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) . ] in this context , it should be noted that the presence of @xmath3 does not induce the appearance of an additional energy level , but a sizeable shift of the energy levels with respect to the non - interacting ones .",
    "therefore , even if no extra energy level appears , it would not be possible to completely discard the existence of a physical state ( resonance ) .",
    "the energy shift , however , can be quite large and , only in this sense , one might speak of the appearance of an additional energy level .",
    "the correction of the second energy level in the virtual state scenario is much less pronounced .",
    "we should note here that the elastic phase shift computed with the @xmath0-matrix in ref .",
    "@xcite does not follow the pattern of a standard breit - wigner distribution associated to a narrow resonance .",
    "indeed , the phase shift does not change quickly from @xmath140 to @xmath141 in the vicinity of the @xmath4 mass , and actually it does not even reach @xmath142 .",
    "this is mostly due to a sizeable background in the amplitude .",
    "we now compare the cases @xmath127 ( fig .  [ fig : energy_levels ] ) and @xmath143 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_levels-500 ] ) . for @xmath144 ,",
    "the relevant ( second ) energy level is more shifted with respect to @xmath145 in the resonance scenario ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_levels-500 ] , left ) than in the virtual scenario ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_levels-500 ] , right ) .",
    "this is the same behaviour already discussed for @xmath127 .",
    "however , the shift for the resonance scenario is smaller in the @xmath129 case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_levels-500 ] , left ) than in the @xmath127 one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_levels ] , left ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath3 is closer to the threshold and the coupling to @xmath2 is smaller for the @xmath143 case .",
    "another important difference between the @xmath127 and @xmath129 results is that the error band of the relevant energy level is smaller when the lighter cutoff is used .",
    "this is due to the different relative errors in both cases , and the fact that for @xmath129 , the relevant level is closer to the @xmath145 free energy than in the @xmath146 case .    .",
    "full ( empty ) circles stand for the energy levels obtained in the resonance ( virtual state ) scenario for the @xmath4 state . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy levels for the @xmath147 ( @xmath136 ) case are shown by blue ( green ) circles .",
    "the energy levels calculated in this work are displayed with two types of error bars : the smaller ones have been obtained considering only the errors of the parameters entering in the @xmath0-matrix ( table  [ table : c - parameters ] ) , whereas the larger ones additionally take into account the errors of the lattice parameters ( table  [ table : lattice - parameters ] ) .",
    "[ fig : energy - levels - zoom ] ]    after having explored the volume dependence of the energy levels predicted with our @xmath85-matrix and scrutinized its physical meaning , we can now compare our results with those reported in ref .",
    "the energy levels in the latter work are obtained from a single volume simulation , @xmath148 , and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy - levels - zoom ] with black squares . in the figure",
    ", we also show the results obtained in this work for @xmath149 , for both the resonance ( filled circles ) and virtual state ( empty circles ) scenarios for the @xmath4 .",
    "besides , the energy levels calculated with @xmath127 and @xmath129 are represented in blue and green , respectively .",
    "we provide two different error bars for our results , considering only the uncertainties of the parameters entering in the @xmath0-matrix ( table  [ table : c - parameters ] ) , or additionally taking into account the errors of the lattice parameters ( table  [ table : lattice - parameters ] ) .",
    "we clearly see three distinct regions , the lowest energies are very close to the @xmath77 threshold ( @xmath150 ) and to the first @xmath1 free energy level ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "these free energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy - levels - zoom ] with red solid horizontal lines . as expected ,",
    "the two lowest lattice levels agree well with our results for both cutoffs and the two @xmath4 state interpretations examined in this work .",
    "the higher energy levels are the relevant ones , and , as already mentioned , our results are significantly shifted to lower energies with respect to @xmath145 for the resonant scenario , while this shift is much smaller for the virtual state one . in general , the lattice results are in very good agreement with the virtual state scenario level for both @xmath144 and @xmath152 cases , whereas in the resonance scenario the agreement is also very good for @xmath143 , and it is not so good for @xmath127 . however , in the latter case , we find @xmath153 , while the lattice energy is @xmath154  @xcite , and hence this non - compatibility is small , the difference being @xmath155 .",
    "the comparison of our results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite support the conclusions given in the latter work : from the energy levels found in that lqcd simulation one can not deduce the existence of a resonance ( a truly physical state , instead of a virtual state ) , namely @xmath4 . but also from this comparison , putting this conclusion in the other way around , one can not discard its existence either .",
    "virtual state ( solid purple lines ) and the @xmath143 resonance scenarios ( dashed blue lines ) around @xmath156 .",
    "the green dashed and dashed - dotted lines represent @xmath157 and @xmath158",
    "non - interacting energies , respectively.[fig : comprv],height=192 ]    finally , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy - levels - zoom ] , a comparison of the relevant energy level obtained in the resonance scenario for @xmath143 ( green filled circle ) with that obtained in the virtual scenario for @xmath127 ( blue empty circle ) shows that , within theoretical uncertainties ( the smallest error bars ) , both cases are indistinguishable .",
    "this fact can already be seen by comparing the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_levels-500 ] and the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_levels ] around @xmath159 .",
    "these energy levels are shown together in fig .",
    "[ fig : comprv ] .",
    "it can be seen that , although these two scenarios can not be distinguished at @xmath160 ( the volume used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , they lead to appreciably different energies already at @xmath161 .",
    "this means that one can not elucidate the nature of this intriguing @xmath4 state with lqcd simulations performed in a single volume .",
    "rather , it would be useful to perform simulations at different values of the box size , to properly study the volume dependence of the energy levels .",
    "of course , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this would bring in a technical problem the appearance of more @xmath1 free energy levels in the energy region of interest , as can be seen in fig .",
