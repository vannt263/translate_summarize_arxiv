    "curved space - time forms the basis for most classical theories of gravity , such as general relativity .",
    "these theories are usually based on a metric for four dimensional space - time  @xcite .",
    "some of the basic concepts used in general relativity and related theories are transformation rules for tensors , the affine connection , and the relation of the metric to proper time along an observer s world line .",
    "a useful , but little - used concept , is that of the world function of space - time , as developed by j. l. synge .",
    "the world function is essentially one - half of the squared measure between two points in space - time .",
    "the utility of the world function comes from the fact that it is closely related to experiments , and that it is a type of scalar quantity .",
    "since the world function transforms as a kind of scalar , it allows us to formulate geometric quantities in a covariant way .",
    "hence , the world function is a valuable tool for understanding the geometric ideas in metric theories of gravity , in three dimensional differential geometry and tensor analysis , and wherever arbitrary coordinate systems are used . as an example of the utility of the world function",
    ", i present its application to the problem of navigation in a curved space - time .",
    "this application actually goes beyond a simple pedagogical example because it deals with the real - world need for precise navigation and time dissemination .",
    "consider the problem of an observer who wants to navigate in a curved space - time with respect to electromagnetic beacons .",
    "i use the word navigate to mean that the observer determines his or her coordinate position and coordinate time along their world line , in some system of space - time coordinates .",
    "i assume that the electromagnetic beacons continuously broadcast their space - time coordinates and that this information is imbedded in the emitted electromagnetic signals .",
    "furthermore , i assume that an observer at unknown coordinates @xmath0 simultaneously receives these signals from four beacons .",
    "the observer s navigation problem is to compute his position @xmath0 from the four received emission event coordinates @xmath1 , @xmath21,2,3,4 , of the electromagnetic beacons .    in the case of flat space - time , the observer must solve the four simultaneous equations @xmath3 equation ( [ lightcone ] ) contains four invariant statements : light signals travel ` on the light cone ' from each emission event to the observer , ( see figure [ lightconeintersectionfigure ] ) . to resolve the branches of the light cones ,",
    "the causality conditions @xmath4 , for @xmath21,@xmath54 , must be added . the relations in eq .",
    "( [ lightcone ] ) are the basic navigation equations applied by users of satellite navigation systems , such as the u.s . global positioning system ( gps ) and the russion global navigation satellite system ( glonass )  @xcite .",
    "the coordinates of the four events , @xmath6 , correspond to particular radio emissions by the satellites .",
    "the emission event coordinates can be extracted from information transmitted by digital codes .",
    "equation ( [ lightcone ] ) is commonly used in two different ways .",
    "first , an observer may receive radio signals from satellites and compute his or her space - time coordinates @xmath7 in terms of four known satellite emission events @xmath6 .",
    "the second use of eq . ( [ lightcone ] ) is to locate a satellite , which is at an unknown position @xmath7 in terms of four ground observations at known coordinates @xmath6 . for this use ,",

    ", there have been significant improvements in the stability of frequency standards and measurement techniques  @xcite .",
    "consequently , over satellite - to - ground distances , precise measurements should be interpreted within the framework of a curved space - time theory  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the equations for navigation in space - time should be manifestly covariant and also invariant  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "i write down a generalization of the navigation eq.([lightcone ] ) for curved space - time and give the detailed equations that must be solved for navigating in the vicinity of the earth , both in schwarzschild coordinates and in rotating coordinates .",
    "i still retain the geometric optics approximation , however , i take into account deviations from flatness to first order in the metric .",
    "this means that the flat - space light cones in eq .",
    "( [ lightcone ] ) are replaced by equations for null geodesics .",
    "the required navigation equations are simply expressible in terms of the world function developed by j. l. synge  @xcite .",
    "the resulting formalism takes into account the delay of electromagnetic signals due to the presence of a gravitational field .",
    "the detailed equations have application to a user who wants to accurately compute his coordinate position and time . in general , the world function approach is useful in applications where high - accuracy measurements must be made over large distances .",
    "an application of recent interest is the design of space - based interferometers for precision sensing and surveillance purposes  @xcite . in some of these designs , in order to achieve high - resolution imaging long base lines ( hundreds of kilometers ) must be used between earth satellites and their separations may need to be accurate to within a micrometer or better . to unambiguously and accurately define such positions , a curved space - time approach should be used that takes into account the warping of the geometry of space - time due to gravitational effects .    in section",
    "ii , i write the generalization of eq.([lightcone ] ) in terms of the world function and point out the limitations of navigation in curved space - time by electromagnetic beacons . in section",
    "iii , i briefly describe the restricted problem of computing an observer s coordinate time if his or her spatial coordinates are known ( a restricted type of navigation ) . in sections iv and v , i give the detailed equations applicable to navigation in the vicinity of the earth in schwarzschild coordinates and in coordinates that rotate with the earth .",
