    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is beset with two finetuning problems .",
    "the first the well - known gauge hierarchy problem ( ghp) pertains to quantum instability of scalar fields as manifested by quadratic divergences .",
    "the ghp can be solved by enlarging the spacetime symmetry group to include supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "realistic supersymmetric models invoke softly broken susy at the weak scale leading to the prediction of a host of new states of matter : the so - called superpartners @xcite .",
    "the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) in @xmath2-parity conserving susy theories is absolutely stable and can be a dark matter ( dm ) candidate . in the case of a neutralino lsp",
    ", the dm particle would be a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) with relic abundance from thermal freeze - out : @xmath3 relic wimps are being searched for in underground , space - based and ice - based detectors .    the second finetuning problem arises in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the approximate global chiral symmetry of qcd @xmath4 , arising from the presence of two light quark fields , provides an understanding of the origin of isospin symmetry and baryon number conservation . at the same time it naively predicts four instead of three light pions : the @xmath5 problem . t hooft s solution of the @xmath5 problem via the qcd theta vacuum and instanton effects requires an additional @xmath0 violating term in the qcd lagrangian : @xmath6 measurements of the neutron edm imply that both this term along with another arising from the quark mass matrix are very tiny , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath7\\lesssim 10^{-10}$ ] .",
    "peccei and quinn ( pq ) explained the absence of @xmath8 by invoking an additional global @xmath9 symmetry along with an axion field @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath11 the potential energy develops a minimum at @xmath12 and the offending term dynamically vanishes .",
    "a consequence of this elegant mechanism is the existence of a physical axion state with mass @xmath13 where the pq scale @xmath14 gev to avoid excessive cooling in supernovae .",
    "while the axion can decay via @xmath15 , its lifetime is longer than the age of the universe .",
    "thus , the axion is also a good cdm candidate .",
    "a population of cold relic axions can be produced via coherent oscillations starting at @xmath16 gev leading to a predicted abundance @xmath17 relic qcd axions are being searched for in microwave cavity experiments such as admx @xcite .",
    "usually the neutralino and axion are considered as dark matter candidates in separate scenarios . however , in order to solve both finetuning problems in the sm , it is natural to invoke simultaneously the susy and pq symmetries .",
    "thus , both neutralino and axion are co - existing dark matter candidates , and we can investigate the new possible scenarios of cosmology in the pre - big bang nucleosynthesis ( pre - bbn ) era and dark matter properties .",
    "if one invokes the susy solution to the ghp and the pq solution to the strong @xmath0 problem , then the axion field must be elevated to a superfield . in four - component notation ,",

    ", @xmath20 is the @xmath2-odd spin-1/2 _ axino _ , @xmath21 is an auxiliary field and in this case the @xmath22s are anticommuting superspace co - ordinates . in gravity - mediated susy breaking models , both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are expected to receive soft masses @xmath23 .",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be produced thermally in the early universe ; since their interactions are suppressed by @xmath24 , the @xmath19 and @xmath20 are quasi - long - lived , and in the case where @xmath20 is the lsp , it is absolutely stable and can even be a component of cdm . in the case where the neutralino is the lsp , one expects mixed axion / neutralino cdm , _",
    "i.e. _ cdm composed of two different particles .",
    "the interplay of @xmath10 , @xmath20 , @xmath19 and @xmath25 modifies the pre - bbn cosmological history , and greatly impacts dark matter production rates .",
    "the early universe cosmology then depends on exactly which susy axion model one invokes . in the following ,",
    "we will discuss two types of susy axion models and their physical characteristics .      in the susy ksvz approach@xcite ,",
    "one introduces vector - like heavy quarks with interaction @xmath26 leading to the axion supermultiplet coupling to mssm particles via @xmath27 loops .",
    "the derivative coupling of @xmath19 and @xmath20 to gluons leads to thermal production rates@xcite which depend on the re - heat temperature @xmath28 : & & 1.3310 ^ -5 g_s^6()^2 ( ) m_s , + & & 0.910 ^ -5 g_s^6()^2 ( ) m _ .",
    "the saxion can also be produced via coherent oscillations ( co ) : 1.910 ^ -5 ( ) ( ) ^2()^2 , which are expected to be dominant at large @xmath29 gev . here",
    "@xmath30 is the temperature at which the saxion starts to oscillate .",
    "axinos may decay into modes such as @xmath31 and @xmath32 thus augmenting the neutralino abundance if decays occur after neutralino freeze - out .",
    "for sufficient axino production rates , this can lead to neutralino re - annihilation at times later than freeze - out which also augments the neutralino abundance @xcite .",
    "the axino decay products also inject entropy into the cosmic soup , thus diluting all relics present at the time of decay .",
    "saxions may decay to @xmath33 and @xmath34 thus creating entropy dilution .",
    "if they decay to susy particles such as @xmath35 or @xmath36 then they will augment the neutralino abundance .",
    "they may also decay via @xmath37 thus contributing to dark radiation .",
    "dark radiation is constrained by the effective number of additional neutrinos @xmath38 .",
    "current data seem to prefer some slight excess , but conservatively@xcite n_eff1.6 .",
    "saxions or axinos which decay at times later than bbn onset ( @xmath39 mev ) are likely to upset standard light element abundances as predicted by bbn ; such scenarios are usually excluded .",
    "the complex interplay of elements of the axion supermultiplet with neutralinos , gravitinos and radiation can be computed using eight coupled boltzmann equations .",
    "an illustration is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] .        in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that susy models with a standard overabundance of neutralino dark matter ( as is typical for cases with a bino - like lsp ) are typically still excluded under a pqmssm cosmology with ksvz axions . at low @xmath40 gev , thermal production of axinos only augments the neutralino overabundance , while at high @xmath41 gev , the neutralino and axion abundance can be entropy diluted but then one tends to overproduce dark radiation from co saxion production followed by @xmath37 decay .",
    "if @xmath37 decay is suppressed ( as can occur in some models ) , then the large @xmath41 gev region can become allowed @xcite although one must be cautious to avoid bbn constraints . in this case",
    ", the dm abundance may be either axion or neutralino dominated",
    ".    for susy models with a standard underabundance of neutralinos , then a wide range of @xmath42 can be allowed , and even values as high as @xmath43 are viable : see fig .",
    "[ fig : sua ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=70.0% ]      the susy dfsz model@xcite is highly motivated in that it provides a solution to the supersymmetric @xmath44-problem @xcite : _ i.e. _ why is the superpotential higgsino mass @xmath45 instead of @xmath46 ?",
    "one may invoke a superpotential of the form _",
    "h_u_d where the singlet superfield @xmath47 carries pq charge @xmath48 and each higgs superfield carries pq charge @xmath49 .",
    "after pq symmetry breaking , then @xmath50 and the superpotential becomes _",
    "u_d where now @xmath51 . with @xmath52 gev ,",
    "then @xmath53 gev is generated , in accord with recent susy naturalness arguments @xcite . as a byproduct ,",
    "one also obtains a direct coupling of the axion superfield with the higgs multiplets : 2_u_d .    in the susy dfsz model ,",
    "the direct axion - higgs - higgs coupling leads to an axino production rate roughly independent of @xmath28 @xcite : y_^tp10 ^ -5()^2()^2 , where @xmath54 depends on the spectra .",
    "although a full calculation of thermal saxion production remains to be completed , one would expect @xmath55 .    also ,",
    "since the axino and saxion directly couple to the higgs multiplets , then the @xmath20 and @xmath19 decays tend to occur much sooner than expectations from the ksvz case . typically for the lower range of @xmath40 gev , one expects decay prior to neutralino freeze - out . in such cases ,",
    "the standard thermal production rate for neutralino dark matter continues to hold , and cases of overproduction of neutralinos would be cosmologically excluded .",
    "such a scenario favors models with an standard underabundance of neutralinos , _",
    "i.e. _ models with either a wino - like or higgsino - like wimp .",
    "then the remaining abundance is filled by axions . in these cases ,",
    "one expects the cdm to be axion - dominated .",
    "an exception to this situation occurs for large @xmath41 gev where thermal saxion and axino production is suppressed , but where co - production of saxions is enhanced . in this case",
    ", depending on pq parameters , saxion decay to susy particles will enhance the neutralino abundance , while decay to sm particles will dilute all relics and decay to axions will add to and possibly exceed limits of dark radiation .",
    "in this section we draw broad implications of the mixed axion / neutralino dark matter picture for dark matter direct and indirect detection .      in the case of axion detection ,",
    "most of the current experimental effort has been focussed on searching for relic axions in the few @xmath44ev range where the standard co - production rate saturates the measured abundance with misalignment angle @xmath56 .",
    "one implication of the susy scenario is that _ all of the measured dark matter abundance need not be axions_. thus , the local abundance may only be a fraction of what is expected from an axion - only scenario .",
    "the second implication is that the allowed range for @xmath57 can really range from very small values @xmath58 gev where the axion may comprise only a fraction of the relic density all the way to @xmath59 gev where a combination of small misalignment angle plus entropy dilution still allows for axions to comprise the bulk of dark matter .",
    "no serious experiments have been proposed so far which can probe the higher range of @xmath57 values .",
    "but even if axions are not found by ongoing searches , then the susy axion picture will not have suffered a significant blow to its allowed parameter space .      as with axions ,",
    "the relic wimp abundance will only be a fraction of its usually assumed value , where one supposes @xmath60 . in the case of relic higgsino or wino - like wimps",
    ", one must adjust theoretical predictions to ( conservatively ) account for the @xmath61 factor where @xmath62 .",
    "for instance @xcite , the spin - independent direct detection rate for higgsino - like wimps with @xmath63 gev is @xmath64 pb . at first glance , these values seem excluded by recent xe-100 searches @xcite which require @xmath65 pb .",
    "however , the local higgsino - like wimp abundance is typically a factor 10 - 15 lower than the measured value @xmath66 , so the limits must be adjusted accordingly .      likewise , indirect wimp detection limits must be adjusted for the possibility of wimps fulfilling only a portion of the local dark matter density . in the case of neutrino telescopes such as icecube ,",
    "the neutrino flux from wimp annihilation in the core of the sun depends more on the ability of the sun to sweep up wimps : if equilibration between capture and annihilation is attained , then no @xmath61 factor is needed .",
    "however , in the case of searches for wimp - wimp annihilation in space into @xmath67-rays or anti - matter , then theoretical projections must be multiplied by a @xmath68 factor .",
