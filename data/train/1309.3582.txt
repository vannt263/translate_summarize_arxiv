    "there has been extensive recent research directed toward providing insights into the tradeoffs among the reliabilities , delays , and throughputs of mobile ad hoc networks with multihop routing ( e.g. , @xcite - @xcite ) . however , the mathematical models and necessary assumptions have not been adequate for obtaining reliable results .",
    "much of this research uses network models based on stochastic geometry with the spatial distribution of the mobiles following a poisson point process , and simplifying but unrealistic restrictions and assumptions .",
    "one of the principal problems associated with the models based on stochastic geometry @xcite , @xcite is that they assume an infinitely large network with an infinite number of mobiles so that routing in the interior of the network can not be distinguished from routing that includes a source or destination mobile near the perimeter of the network .",
    "the poisson point process does not account for the dependencies in the placement of mobiles , such as the existence of exclusion zones @xcite that ensure a minimum spatial separation between mobiles",
    ". among the unrealistic restrictions are the absence of shadowing , the neglect of thermal noise , and the identical fading statistics for each link . among the unrealistic assumptions are the independence of the success probabilities of paths from the source to the destination even when paths share the same links , and the constraining of the number of end - to - end retransmissions rather than link retransmissions .",
    "this analysis in this paper combines closed - form calculations of outage probabilities , derived in @xcite , with simple and rapid simulations that accomodate additional network features .",
    "this approach allows routing to be statistically characterized without requiring assumptions about the statistical independence of possible paths . during each trial of the simulation ,",
    "the topology is fixed and mobiles are placed according to any distribution ; we focus on uniform clustering with exclusion and guard zones .",
    "paths for message delivery are selected by using the closed - form expression for the per - link outage probability to determine which paths are possible , and the delay associated with each available link is determined .",
    "the number of transmission attempts per link is constrained , and several routing protocols are considered .",
    "using these paths and averaging over many topologies , three routing protocols are examined : least - delay , nearest - neighbor , and maximum - progress routing .",
    "the dependence of the path reliability , area spectral efficiency , average message delay , and average number of hops on network parameters such as the maximum number of transmission attempts per link , source - destination distance , and density of mobiles are evaluated .    among the features of our analysis that distinguish it from those by other authors",
    "are the following .",
    "distinct links do not necessarily experience identically distributed fading .",
    "source - destination pairs are not assumed to be stochastically equivalent .",
    "for example if a source or destination is located near the perimeter of the network , the routing characteristics are different from those computed for source - destination pairs near the center of the network .",
    "there is no assumption of independent path selection , path success probabilities , or link ( hop ) success probabilities . many routes share links , which cause all these routes to fail if one of the shared links fails .",
    "link success probabilities are correlated to the degree that lengths of the links are similar .",
    "the shadowing over the link from one mobile to another can be modeled individually , as required by the local terrain . for computational simplicity in the examples ,",
    "the shadowing is assumed to have a lognormal distribution .",
    "the analysis accounts for the thermal noise , which is an important consideration when the mobile density , and hence the interference , is moderate or low .",
    "the routing protocols do not depend on predetermined routes .",
    "instead , they use the more realistic _ dynamic route selection _ that entails hop - by - hop route selection and allows for the possibility of successful communication over alternative routes .",
    "the network comprises @xmath0 mobiles in a circular area with radius @xmath1 , although any arbitrary two- or three - dimensional regions could be considered . the variable @xmath2 represents both the @xmath3 mobile and its location , and",
    "@xmath4 is the distance from the @xmath3 mobile to the @xmath5 mobile .",
    "mobile @xmath6 serves as the reference transmitter or message source , and mobile @xmath7 serves as the reference receiver or message destination .",
    "the other @xmath8 mobiles @xmath9 are potentially relays or sources of interference .",
    "each mobile uses a single omnidirectional antenna .",
    "the radii of the exclusion zones surrounding the mobiles are equal to @xmath10    the source and destination mobiles are placed within the circular area , and the remaining mobiles @xmath11 are uniformly distributed throughout the network area outside the exclusion zones , according to a _ uniform clustering _ model .",
    "one by one , the location of each remaining @xmath2 is drawn according to a uniform distribution within the radius-@xmath1 circle . however",
    ", if an @xmath2 falls within the exclusion zone of a previously placed mobile , then it has a new random location assigned to it as many times as necessary until it falls outside all exclusion zones . setting the exclusion zone to @xmath12",
    "is equivalent to drawing the mobiles from a binomial point process .    in a ds - cdma network of asynchronous quadriphase direct - sequence systems ,",
    "a multiple - access interference signal with power @xmath13 before despreading is reduced after despreading to the power level @xmath14 , where g is the _ processing gain _ or _ spreading factor _ , and @xmath15 is a function of the chip waveform and the timing offset @xmath16 of the interference spreading sequence relative to that of the desired or reference signal .",
    "if @xmath16 is assumed to have a uniform distribution over [ 0 , @xmath17,$ ] then the expected value of @xmath15 is the chip factor @xmath18 . for rectangular chip waveforms , @xmath19 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is assumed henceforth that @xmath20 is a constant equal to @xmath21 at each sector receiver in the network .",

    "fading statistics , nakagami fading is assumed , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is nakagami with parameter @xmath36 .",
    "when the channel between @xmath2 and @xmath22 undergoes rayleigh fading , @xmath37 and the corresponding @xmath26 is exponentially distributed . in the presence of shadowing with a lognormal distribution ,",
    "the @xmath38 are independent zero - mean gaussian with variance @xmath39 .",
    "for ease of exposition , it is assumed that the shadowing variance is the same for the entire network , but the results may be easily generalized to allow for different shadowing variances over parts of the network . in the absence of shadowing , @xmath40 .",
    "it is assumed that the \\{@xmath32 remain fixed for the duration of a time interval but vary independently from interval to interval ( block fading ) .",
    "we define @xmath41 to be the service probability that mobile @xmath42 can serve as a relay along a path from a source to a destination . with probability @xmath43 ,",
    "the @xmath3 mobile transmits in the same time interval as the desired signal .",
    "the @xmath44 can be used to model voice - activity factors , controlled silence , or failed link transmissions and the resulting retransmission attempts .",
    "when the @xmath5 mobile is in service as a potential relay , we set @xmath45    the instantaneous signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) at the mobile @xmath22 of the signal transmitted by relay @xmath46 is given by@xmath47 where @xmath48 is the noise power , and the indicator @xmath49 is a bernoulli random variable with probability @xmath50=p_{i}$ ] and @xmath51=1-p_{i}$ ] .",
    "since the despreading does not significantly affect the desired - signal power , the substitution of ( [ power ] ) and ( [ pathloss ] ) into ( [ sinr1 ] ) yields @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the normalized power of @xmath2 at @xmath22 , @xmath54 is the received power from @xmath2 at the reference distance @xmath25 before despreading when fading and shadowing are absent , and @xmath55 is the snr when relay @xmath46 is at unit distance from mobile @xmath22 and fading and shadowing are absent .",
    "the _ outage probability _ quantifies the likelihood that the noise and interference will be too severe for useful communications .",
