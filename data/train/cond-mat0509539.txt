    "computer simulations based on monte carlo sampling methods have increased dramatically our understanding of the behavior of the standard classical statistical mechanics systems ( for instance ising - like models ) , but also of the more complex systems , such us disordered media , polymeric and glassy materials .",
    "our main approach , in the past half - century , was based on importance sampling in the canonical ensemble . the metropolis method and",
    "its variants were , for many years , the main tools in condensed matter physics , particularly for the study of critical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "however , for complex systems effective potentials have a complicated rugged landscape with many minima and maxima which become more pronounced with increasing system size . in many such cases the metropolis method and its variants are very inefficient methods .",
    "entropic sampling methods ( esm ) are alternatives to the importance sampling methods , which at least in principle do not suffer from such problems . of course , for second order phase transitions in unfrustrated systems cluster algorithms are quite efficient and",
    "have essentially solved the `` critical slowing down '' problem .",
    "the performance limitations of flat - histogram or entropic methods have recently attracted considerable interest . even for simple systems , such as the ising model , such methods have tunnelling times in energy space that are not proportional to @xmath3 as should be expected for a pure random walk but they are proportional to a higher power .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that tunnelling times may be strongly depended on the model under consideration  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in order to apply an esm the density of states ( dos ) of the system should be known .    over the last decade ,",
    "several efficient methods that directly calculate the dos of classical statistical models have been developed .",
    "a few remarkable examples are the entropic  @xcite , multicanonical @xcite , broad histogram  @xcite , transition matrix  @xcite and wang - landau  @xcite methods . using these methods , it is now possible to accurately estimate the dos of quite large classical statistical models  @xcite . since for complex systems",
    "the metropolis method may be trapped for very long times in non - representative energy subspaces it is reasonable to consider an esm program using an approximate dos as an alternative to the traditional importance sampling methods .",
    "although this idea exists in the literature  @xcite , the effectiveness of the various possible implementations have not been exploited by systematic comparative studies .",
    "for instance , the following two - run strategy may be used in an esm program . in the first stage an accurate estimation of the dos of the system under consideration",
    "is achieved with the help of say the wang - landau ( wl ) method , and in the second stage the derived dos is used in an esm to estimate further properties of the system , such as the order - parameter distribution . in such a two - stage program ,",
    "the crmes method recently developed by malakis _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite may be used to restrict the energy space and make such a program more efficient for the estimation of the critical behavior of any statistical system .",
    "our first objective in this paper is to extent the crmes condition and to observe to what degree appropriately defined energy subspaces are sufficiently large for the estimation of all finite - size anomalies .",
    "our second objective focuses on the possibility to obtain all critical properties of the system by using a one - run strategy of an esm , based on a wl random walk in a restricted energy subspace .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] we provide a brief outline of the crmes restriction and give alternative definitions of the dominant energy subspaces .",
    "the scaling of the extensions of these subspaces is illustrated for the baxter - wu and ising models . in sec .",
    "[ section3a ] we discuss how , by employing the wl and the n - fold implementation of the wl scheme in a restricted energy subspace , we may generate approximations of the dos of the system and at the same time obtain energy - order - parameter ( @xmath0 ) histograms .",
    "it is suggested that this one - run wl strategy yields good estimates of all magnetic properties . in sec .",
    "[ section3b ] we consider the 2d ising model as a test case .",
    "our estimates are compared with those of the traditional metropolis method and the expected magnetic scaling behavior is recovered . finally , in sec .  [ section3c ] we study our dominant subspace method in the energy and the order - parameter space",
    ". the subspaces sufficient for an accurate estimation of magnetic finite - size anomalies are determined and their scaling is analyzed .",
    "the tail - regime of the order - parameter critical distribution is briefly discussed and the shortcomings of the metropolis method are clarified .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ section4 ] .",
    "let us start by recalling the original crmes restriction of malakis _ et al . _",
    "assume that @xmath4 denotes the value of energy producing the maximum term in the partition function of the statistical model , for instance the ising model , at some temperature of interest .",
    "since we deal with a finite system of linear size @xmath5 , we are interested in the properties ( finite - size anomalies ) near some pseudocritical temperature @xmath6 , which in general depends on @xmath5 but also on the property studied .",
    "thus , for the specific heat peaks let us use the notation @xmath7\\equiv t_{l , c}$ ] for the pseudocritical temperature and define a set of approximations by restricting the statistical sums to energy subranges around the value @xmath8)=\\widetilde{e}(t_{l , c})$ ] .",
    "let these subranges of the total energy range @xmath9 be denoted as follows :    @xmath10    accordingly , the peaks are approximated by : @xmath11}\\right.\\\\ \\left.- \\left(\\widetilde{z}^{-1}\\sum_{\\widetilde{e}_{-}}^{\\widetilde{e}_{+}}e\\exp{[\\widetilde{\\phi}(e)]}\\right)^{2}\\right\\}\\ ] ] @xmath12-\\left[s(\\widetilde{e})-\\beta \\widetilde{e}\\right],\\;\\;\\widetilde{z}=\\sum_{\\widetilde{e}_{-}}^{\\widetilde{e}_{+}}\\exp{[\\widetilde{\\phi}(e)]}\\ ] ]    since by definition @xmath13 is negative we can easily see that for large lattices extreme values of energy ( far from @xmath4 ) will have an extremely small contribution to the statistical sums , since these terms decrease exponentially fast with the distance from @xmath4 .",
    "it follows that , if we request a specified accuracy , then we may restrict the necessary energy range in which dos should be sampled . to introduce the minimum energy subspace ( mes ) , we impose the condition : @xmath14 where @xmath15 measures the relative error and it will be set equal to a small number ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 is the value of the maximum of the specific heat obtained by using the total energy range . with the help of a convenient definition , we can specify the minimum energy subspaces satisfying the above condition .",
    "their finite - size extensions will be denoted by : @xmath18 demanding the same level of accuracy ( r ) for all lattice sizes , we produce a size - dependence on all parameters of the above energy ranges and in particular the extensions of the critical mes should obey the scaling law  @xcite : @xmath19 in order to determine the location of the mes we may follow successive minimal approximations to the specific heat peak @xcite :    [ eq:5 ] @xmath20 where one the above @xmath21-increments is chosen to be @xmath22 and the other @xmath23 according to which side of @xmath4 is producing at the current stage the best approximation : @xmath24 the above defines a sequence of relative errors for the specific heat peaks ( @xmath25 ) : @xmath26    and the mes is the subspace centered at @xmath4 corresponding to the first member of the above sequence ( [ eq:5 ] ) satisfying : @xmath27 . the location of these subspaces can be predicted either by extrapolation , from smaller lattices , or by using the early - stage dos approximation of the wl method  @xcite . using a sufficiently wider subspace we can also accurately estimate their extensions and verify the scaling law ( [ eq:4 ] ) as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the above scheme has been tested for the ising and baxter - wu models  @xcite and it has been shown that this particular rule provides very accurate extensions satisfying quite well the expected scaling law ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "however , one may conceive other ways for specifying the locations of the energy subspaces that will essentially produce comparable approximations .",
    "a simple idea is to use a condition based on the energy probability density ( @xmath28 ) meaning the application of eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) at a particular pseudocritical temperature @xmath29 .",
    "that is , we may define the end - points ( @xmath30 ) of the subspaces by simply comparing the corresponding probability densities with the maximum at the energy @xmath4 : @xmath31    applying this restriction at a particular ( pseudocritical ) temperature ( @xmath6 ) is much easier than applying the successive minimal approximations described in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) and it will produce comparable approximations for the specific heat maxima .",
    "the corresponding scaling variable @xmath32 for the resulting mes should also obey the law ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "another interesting pseudocritical temperature , is the temperature corresponding to the forth order binder s cumulant for the energy distribution .",
    "this reduced cumulant is defined by : @xmath33 and it is well known  @xcite that this quantity has a minimum , @xmath34 , at a pseudocritical temperature @xmath35\\equiv t_{l , v}$ ] . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "this temperature also approaches the critical temperature but for finite lattices is different from the pseudocritical temperature @xmath29 of the specific heat .",
    "thus , the maximum term of the partition function , corresponding to the temperature of the cumulant finite - size anomaly , will be now located at a different value of the energy spectrum ( say at @xmath36 ) . therefore , if we follow the probability density criterion described above in eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) to define the crmes at these temperatures we will generally find subspaces that do not coincide with the subspaces for the specific heat . however , for large lattices the non - overlapping parts of these subspaces are relatively very small and we may run the wl algorithm in the union of these subspaces in order to study both properties .",
    "let us now , follow an analogous approach with the successive minimal approximations of eq .  ( [ eq:5 ] ) for the cumulant anomaly .",
    "it is of interest to note that if we define the crmes by a similar condition : @xmath37 then , for sufficiently large lattices , the scaling law ( [ eq:4 ] ) for the corresponding extensions ( we may now use the @xmath38 variable ) will not be obeyed .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cumulant goes asymptotically to a finite value ( @xmath39 ) and therefore the relative accuracy criterion ( [ eq:8 ] ) is not appropriate for large lattices or , in other words , becomes ineffective ( see also the discussion bellow ) .",
    "we may now introduce the finite - size distance from the asymptotic value of the binder s parameter , ( @xmath40 ) , to our considerations and modify the criterion ( [ eq:8 ] ) as follows : @xmath41    it appears ( see bellow ) that this option makes the extensions of the resulting subspaces to follow very well the scaling law ( [ eq:4 ] ) and for the 2d ising model we obtain an almost perfect coincidence with the extensions of the corresponding subspaces obtained for the specific heat .",
    "the corresponding scaling variable will be denoted by @xmath42 . for a second - order transition",
    "the limiting value of the energy cumulant is known ( @xmath43 ) and this makes the implementation of the scheme ( [ eq:9 ] ) possible .",
    "the above alternative definitions for the crmes were applied to the 2d ising model using the dos data of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath44 but also new data up to @xmath45 .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the scaling behavior of the corresponding scaling variables for the crmes of the specific heat at its pseudocritical temperature @xmath29 using the minimum subspaces resulting from eq .",
    "( [ eq:5c ] ) , and also the minimum subspaces resulting , at this temperature , from the probability density condition studied in eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "the same figure displays the estimates for the two options ( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) for the crmes corresponding to the minimum of the binder s parameter at its pseudocritical  temperature @xmath46 . the expected logarithmic scaling law  @xcite is obeyed well for all definitions with a clear exception of the cumulant condition ( [ eq:8 ] ) in which case the scaling variable shows a clear decline from the logarithmic divergence for large lattices .",
    "this is due to the fact that this parameter approaches the finite value @xmath43 , and the condition defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) becomes ineffective for large lattices .",
    "note that with increasing lattice size several significant figures of this finite number are determined from a small part of the dominant energy subspace .",
    "the trick proposed in eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) not only keeps the scheme in the proper scaling form but also it is remarkable that the resulting extensions of the crmes of the specific heat and the binder s parameter completely coincide for the 2d ising model .",
    "this coincidence occurs also for the baxter - wu model , but not for the 3d ising model ( see bellow ) .",
    "note however , that the corresponding pseudocritical temperatures are different and their crmes do not coincide ( for @xmath47 their displacement is @xmath48 energy levels ) , only their extensions are equal .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrates the behavior of the same scaling variables for the 3d ising model using the dos data of ref .",
    "the situation is very similar and is described by the power law ( [ eq:4 ] ) as discussed in ref .",
    "noteworthy , that the cumulant condition ( [ eq:8 ] ) leads to a clear decline from the appropriate power law for large lattices and the trick proposed in eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) seems to yield the expected critical behavior . finally , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] presents the analogous graphs for the baxter - wu model using the dos data of  @xcite .",
    "again the scaling variables appear to follow the expected scaling law ( [ eq:4 ] ) and a decline in the case of the condition ( [ eq:8 ] ) is observed .",
    "however , this decline is weaker for the baxter - wu model due to the fact that the cumulant minimum is quite deeper for this model , that is the difference @xmath49 is relatively larger for the baxter - wu model .",
    "fitting these data to the expected power law ( see the discussion in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) we find that the best estimate for the exponent @xmath1 is produced from the original  @xcite minimum subspaces of the specific heat .",
    "as mentioned above the extensions of the crmes determined for the cumulant by the condition ( [ eq:9 ] ) for the 2d baxter - wu model coincide with the extensions of the crmes of the specific heat ( eq .  ( [ eq:2 ] ) ) of the model .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the esm method using an exact ( if available ) or an accurate approximation of the dos may be considered as an alternative to the various importance sampling methods used in the literature to estimate canonical averages and probability distributions of macroscopic thermodynamic variables . here",
    "we shall examine the idea of producing accurate estimates for finite - size magnetic anomalies by using a simple esm based on the wl random walk in an appropriately restricted energy subspace @xmath50 .",
    "we shall also test our results by comparing to the metropolis method @xcite .    we implement a wl random walk in a restricted energy subspace @xmath50 and at the same time we accumulate data for the two - parameter ( @xmath0 ) histogram . for a large system we employ a multi - range algorithm  @xcite in which independent random walks are used for different energy subintervals and the resultant pieces",
    "are then combined to obtain the dos in @xmath50 .",
    "the wl modification factor ( @xmath51 ) is reduced at the jth iteration according to : @xmath52 and for the histogram flatness we use a @xmath53 criterion as in our previous studies  @xcite .",
    "note that , the detailed balance condition is satisfied in the limit @xmath54 . let the exact density of states be denoted by @xmath55 and the dos of the above wl process be denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath57 be the histogram produced during the wl process by a specific recipe which will be described below .",
    "the resulting approximation of the dos and the corresponding @xmath0 histograms may be used to estimate the magnetic properties of the system in a temperature range , which is covered , by the restricted energy subspace @xmath50 .",
    "canonical averages will be then approximated as follows :    [ eq:10 ] @xmath58 where the microcanonical averages @xmath59 are obtained from the @xmath57 histograms as : @xmath60    and the summation in @xmath61 runs over all values generated during the process in the restricted energy subspace @xmath50 .",
    "the accuracy of the magnetic properties obtained from the above averaging process will depend on many factors .",
    "firstly , the used energy subspace restricts the temperature range for which such approximations may be accurate .",
    "this restriction has as a result that the process will not visit all possible values of @xmath61 , but this fact is of no consequence for the accuracy of the magnetic properties at the temperature range of interest , as far as the estimated dos is accurate .",
    "secondly , the accuracy of the above microcanonical estimators will , as usually , depend on the total number of visits to a given energy level @xmath62 , and also to the number of different spin states visited within this energy level",
    ". however , these are statistical fluctuations inherent in any monte carlo method and we should expect improvement by increasing the number of repetitions of the process . at this point let us point out that statistical fluctuations may be reduced , as usually , by multiple measurements but also by using some refinements of the original wl algorithm  @xcite .",
    "an illustrative figure including such a refinement will be presented in the next subsection .",
    "finally , the construction of reliable ( uniform ) approximations for microcanonical averages is an important open problem , discussed recently in some detail by p. m. c. de oliveira  @xcite .",
    "the microcanonical approximations @xmath63 , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) , and used in this paper are obtained from the wl multi - range process , and the corresponding n - fold version of shulz _ et al . _",
    "the recipes employed are outlined and tested in the sequel .",
    "there are mainly three categories of microcanonical simulation approaches . in the first",
    ", one tries to satisfy completely the fixed - energy constraint , a typical example is the q2r cellular automaton  @xcite . in the second , one tries to mildly relax the energy constraint by using relatively small energy - windows in order to avoid ergodic problems , as done by creutz  @xcite in his `` demon '' method . finally , the fixed - energy constraint is completely relaxed @xcite and various ideas have been tried , ranging from the tuned temperature canonical approach of oliveira  @xcite to the flat histogram recipe of j .- s .",
    "wang  @xcite .",
    "in order to present some justification for the scheme of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:10a])-([eq:10b ] ) let us suppose that we know the exact dos and we are about to perform an infinitely long entropic sampling in the restricted energy subspace @xmath50 .",
    "in this case we can write for the monte carlo process with sampling probability @xmath64  @xcite :    [ eq:11 ] @xmath65    the last approximation in eq .",
    "( [ eq:11a ] ) assumes that in the limit of an infinite markovian chain the @xmath66 histogram is perfectly flat .",
    "accordingly , @xmath66 has been set equal to a constant in the denominator ( in replacing the sum over the @xmath67 sampled microstates by a sum over energies ) and then moved to the numerator in order to form the esm microcanonical averages defined by : @xmath68    the above observation shows that the esm microcanonical average should be an unbiased estimator for the fundamental microcanonical average : @xmath69    therefore , eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) provides the essential theoretical support for using a multi - range wl process ( at its late stages ) to obtain microcanonical simulators .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the high - level stages @xmath70 of the wl process will resemble the dynamics of the esm and therefore will produce good approximations for the microcanonical averages .",
    "this approach is similar in many respects to the flat histogram method of j .- s .",
    "wang  @xcite .",
    "since the resemblance of the wl process with the esm depends on the value of the control parameter @xmath71 , we shall classify our recipes by using the @xmath72-range utilized for updating the @xmath73 histogram during the wl process .",
    "thus , if all accepted microstates of the wl process during the @xmath72-range @xmath74 are used , for updating the @xmath73 histogram , the resulting recipes will be denoted by wl@xmath75 .",
    "when using the n - fold version of the wl process we always start with several @xmath76 wl @xmath72-iterations and then continue the process from the next level @xmath77 by carrying out further n - fold wl iterations @xmath78 . in this recipe , we shall use only the n - fold iterations for updating the @xmath73 histogram and time - weight the histogram by using the life - time of microstates calculated according to the n - fold method  @xcite .",
    "the resulting recipes are denoted by wl(n - fold)@xmath79 .",
    "the above described schemes were tested by using eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) to obtain certain magnetic properties of the 2d ising model ( for lattices with sizes @xmath80 ) and compare to the estimates obtained by the metropolis method .",
    "the finite - size anomaly of the susceptibility and its value at the exact critical temperature , as well as the value of the order parameter also at the exact critical temperature were used in these tests and appear in the following subsection .",
    "for the magnetic susceptibility we have used the definition : @xmath81 and for the order parameter : @xmath82",
    "the estimates of the metropolis method were obtained as follows .",
    "first an initial equilibration period of @xmath83 usual monte carlo steps ( lattice sweeps ) was applied without updating the histograms .",
    "after thermalization , the updating of the histograms was applied in every monte carlo step , while the magnetic properties , the order - parameter distributions and the time evolving dominant @xmath61-subspaces were determined and observed in time steps of @xmath83 monte carlo sweeps .",
    "the time evolution lasted a total of @xmath84 such time steps for all lattice sizes ( for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , see also the discussion bellow ) .",
    "thus , for a lattice of linear size @xmath47 , the above time evolution accounts to a total of @xmath87 lattice sweeps .",
    "the estimates of the wl multi - range process were obtained using , for each lattice size , @xmath88 independent random walks in the appropriate ( @xmath89 ) energy subspace .",
    "these subspaces were chosen carefully to cover a wide temperature range close to the critical point , so that the dos and the @xmath90 histograms produced would yield accurate estimates of all thermal and magnetic properties in the temperature - range .",
    "the energy subspaces were wide enough to produce relative accuracies , within the scheme , far beyond the criterion @xmath16 , which was finally applied to determine the dominant subspaces .",
    "the time requirements of the described metropolis estimation were notably greater than the described wl multi - range process of @xmath88 independent random walks .",
    "for @xmath47 the wl scheme was about @xmath91 times faster than the metropolis scheme .",
    "note that the metropolis method produces estimates only for one particular temperature and not for a wide temperature - range . for a lattice of linear size @xmath86 the above described wl scheme is at least @xmath92 times faster than the described metropolis scheme .",
    "the estimates derived from the wl recipes appear to have relatively small deviations from the corresponding metropolis estimates and , with a notable exception , they seem to be within the given error bounds . the comparison with the metropolis method is presented in figs .",
    "[ fig4],[fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "the relative variations shown in these graphs are defined with respect to the metropolis estimates by assuming that these are more accurate , i.e we define : @xmath93 where @xmath94 and/or @xmath95 .",
    "the error bounds used in these graphs refer to the metropolis estimates in the observed equilibrium regime which is roughly defined as the last almost flat part ( @xmath96 ) in the above described @xmath84 time - steps . to define the error bounds we have used a confidence level of @xmath97 standard deviations obtained in this wide time - window .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the relative deviations from the metropolis mean values of the order - parameter at the exact critical temperature for four recipes of the wl scheme , as indicated in this figure .",
    "the metropolis estimates have very small error bounds of the order of @xmath98 or less , besides the fact that we have applied the above mentioned demanding confidence limit .",
    "the deviations of the wl schemes are reasonable ( of the order of @xmath99 or less ) with the clear exception of the case wl(1 - 24 ) in which the histogram s @xmath100 updating started from the very early stage of the wl process . for large lattices , this recipe seems to produce a significant overestimation of the order - parameter , at the exact critical temperature , and this is enhanced with increasing lattice size . since , the detailed balance is strongly violated at the early stages of the wl process , the observed failure of this recipe should be attributed to the detailed balance violation .",
    "the related overestimation may be possibly a result of an oversampling distortion of large magnetization values at the low energy part of the energy range used .",
    "distortions stemming from the violation of the detailed balance condition are difficult to explain and in general their origin is a subtle matter .",
    "however , such systematic distortions are not observed for the other three recipes appearing in fig .",
    "we consider this as a first strong indication that the weak violation of the detailed balance condition for these high - level wl schemes is not statistically significant .",
    "the behavior of the relative deviations for the susceptibilities at the exact critical temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , and at the pseudocritical temperatures in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] appear in general , much better from those shown in fig .",
    "again the distortions of the wl(1 - 24 ) scheme become pronounced as we increase the lattice size .    at this point",
    "let us try to observe in more detail the effect of the wl iteration level on an estimated magnetic property and also the effect of one of the simplest refinements of the wl algorithm for the square ising lattice of size @xmath101 .",
    "using an accurate dos , @xmath102 , obtained from a previous wl run ( @xmath103 ) , we have calculated , with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) , the critical susceptibility @xmath104 as a function of the wl iteration level in a new wl diffusion process . in this new multi - range ( mr )",
    "process each wl iteration level is repeated @xmath88 times for each energy subinterval . fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the evolution of the critical susceptibility to its equilibrium value for five cases . in the first case ( mr - wl1 ) the updating of @xmath73 histograms follows the recipe wl(@xmath105 ) and in the second case ( mr - wl2 ) the recipe wl(@xmath106 )",
    "the third case ( mr - wl2@xmath107 ) follows a refinement of the wl algorithm proposed by zhou and bhatt  @xcite .",
    "the additional element of the algorithm is that now we allow for a number @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) spin - flips between successive records in the histograms ( and in the dos modification ) .",
    "introduction of such a separation diminishes systematic errors due to the correlation between adjacent records as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . from the first case we note that starting the @xmath73 histogram updating process at the early stage of the wl difusion is analogous to adding a `` non - equilibrium memory effect '' in our cumulative histograms .",
    "this early effect is stronger when the wl algorithm is used in a simple one - range fashion , as our simulations have shown .",
    "it is also apparent that the refinement introduced by the separation @xmath107 clearly improves , in the cost of the additional spin - flips , the behavior of the evolution of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath104 towards its final equilibrium value , which otherwise ( @xmath109 ) is obtained in a longer run .",
    "zhou and bhatt  @xcite have given a proof of the convergence of the wl algorithm and found that the fluctuation of the histogram is proportional to @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the modification factor .",
    "this has been recently confirmed by numerical tests  @xcite , where it was shown that the criterion for reducing @xmath111 goes beyond the `` flat histogram '' idea and that `` enough statistics '' should be obtained in each wl iteration . according to lee , okabe , and landau  @xcite",
    "an optimal algorithm will stop the simulation as soon as the histogram fluctuation at the jth iteration , denoted as @xmath112 , becomes saturated . in order to observe whether we will have a noticeable improvement on the magnetic susceptibility estimates by applying the proposed entropic sampling scheme ( wl(12 - 24 ) ) for longer simulation times , at each @xmath113 iteration , we present also in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the cases wl2@xmath114 ) and wl2@xmath115 ) .",
    "both these runs were performed via a simple one - range wl scheme , using at each iteration more monte carlo steps per spin ( mcss ) than required for the saturation of @xmath116 .",
    "moreover , the latter case uses three times the number of mcss of the former .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] illustrates the clear saturation of @xmath117 for these runs ( the solid ( dotted ) line corresponds to duration @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) ) .",
    "comparing the estimates of the last three cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( @xmath108 ) we may draw the following conclusions .",
    "firstly , the multi - range approach applied in the case mr - wl2s gives comparable estimates to those obtained from the one - range implementation of the wl scheme and secondly , a much longer run , such as the wl2@xmath115 ) , does not yield a noticeable improvement .",
    "it appears that an optimal and quite accurate implementation of the proposed entropic scheme can be constructed using a multi - range @xmath90 histogram updating process , during the high - level `` well saturated '' wl iterations .    the recent combination of lee s entropic sampling with the wl algorithm presented in ref .",
    "@xcite may be also implemented to test and possibly improve the proposed here crmes entropic scheme . finally , the adaptive algorithm of trebst _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is of particular interest for a crmes implementation and would be also stimulating to compare the `` bottleneck region '' , or region of minimum diffusivity , of this method with the dominant energy subspaces as defined in this manuscript .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , the high - level wl(crmes ) schemes are reasonable alternatives to the metropolis method .",
    "the estimates for thermodynamic parameters involving higher moments of critical distributions appear to be of the same or even better accuracy with those corresponding to the traditional method .",

    "[ section3b ] .",
    "it is of some interest to list here some details of the end - points of the dominant magnetization subspaces .",
    "let us consider the case @xmath47 as an example .",
    "the broad energy range used in our runs for the wl process was ( @xmath138 ) , where the counting of energy states is given by @xmath139 .",
    "the dominant energy ranges are ( a ) at the pseudocritical temperature of the specific heat ( @xmath140 ) and ( b ) at the pseudocritical temperature of the susceptibility ( @xmath141 ) .",

    "note that for all lattice sizes the left - end of the dominant magnetization subspace is @xmath143 .",
    "let us now present the metropolis time - evolution of the dominant @xmath61-subspaces since this development offers a didactic example of the very slow tail - convergence of the traditional importance sampling methods .",
    "[ fig11 ] illustrates the slow equilibration process of the metropolis algorithm at the tails of the order - parameter distribution . to draw this graph the time - developing crmms , for the two @xmath15-levels ( @xmath145 and @xmath16 ) shown , was divided by the corresponding crmms predicted by the high - level wl(n - fold:12 - 24 ) scheme which appear to have very small errors for the lattice sizes shown .",
    "thus , considering these later crmms as exact the metropolis relative dominant @xmath61-subspaces should grow in time towards the value @xmath22 .",
    "for the value @xmath145 this is almost achieved at the time @xmath146 for both lattices shown , @xmath147 and @xmath47 . however , for @xmath16 , we observe a very slow relaxation process which persists even if we increase the observation time .",

    "this situation is due to the very slow equilibration at the tails of the distribution and in particular at the large-@xmath61 tail .",
    "in fact the time - expansion of the crmms in the metropolis process is due to the gradual movement of the right - end of the magnetization range to larger values , since the left - end is @xmath143 from the very first stages of the process .",
    "returning to the large-@xmath61 range is a rare event for the metropolis algorithm and this makes this traditional scheme inaccurate in the far tail - regime , but also very inefficient for the study of the tails of the critical distributions .",

    "[ fig10 ] were obtained by using runs with approximately equal time requirements ( about @xmath150 hours in a pentium iv 3ghz ) with the wl(n - fold:14 - 26 ) scheme .",
    "for the case @xmath86 this corresponds to only @xmath88 time - steps with the developing relative crmms ( @xmath16 ) having hardy approached the value of @xmath151 only . even by using a much longer run ( for instance @xmath152 times longer ) the metropolis algorithm will not give an adequate description of the far - tail regime .",
    "critical dominant energy and order - parameter subspaces can be defined by various alternative restrictive schemes , as shown in this work . in this way it is possible to optimize the monte carlo schemes and study simultaneously all finite - size anomalies of statistical models .",
    "the finite - size extensions of the dominant energy and order - parameter subspaces scale with exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "our experience with this subject leads us to conclude that the extensions of these dominant subspaces are more accurate than the estimates of the corresponding thermodynamic variables ( specific heat and susceptibility ) , establishing the critical minimum subspace method as a new alternative for the estimation of the associated critical exponents from finite - size monte carlo data .",
    "the presented clarification and generalization of the crmes method greatly speeds up the monte carlo simulations in many applications of the methods determining the spectral densities in classical statistical models .",
    "furthermore , the presented one - run high - level wl entropic sampling schemes provide efficient alternatives when carried out in appropriately defined dominant subspaces .",
    "we expect that for complex systems with long trapping times , these schemes will appear to be much more advantageous in almost all respects .",
    "this last expectation has been verified by our studies of the random - field ising model , which will be published shortly .",
    "moreover , these methods have general advantages , the most important of these being : ( a ) the fact that one can improve the @xmath90 histograms by repeated application of the method ( at the same time we improve the accuracy of the dos in the energy space ) , and ( b ) the fact that their implementation in a sufficiently broad energy subspace provides data for calculating all finite - size properties of the statistical system , which are relevant for the prediction of the asymptotic critical behavior .",
