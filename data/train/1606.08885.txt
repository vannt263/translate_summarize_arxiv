    "<S> this is also the case if the incline angle is varied , which we verified in additional tests . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the collapse of the three different definitions of @xmath17 in the various cases is strong , evidencing the generality of the @xmath68 formula .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.245    0.245    0.245    0.245     +    0.245    0.245    0.245    0.245    there are at least two ways to reconcile these results physically , one with kinetic theory and another in terms of an activated process . </S>",
    "<S> regarding kinetic theory , in lun et al.s work @xcite , @xmath2 and the viscosity @xmath81 in a granular gas are functions of @xmath29 and granular temperature @xmath82 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the density @xmath85 and @xmath86 are functions of packing fraction @xmath29 . under these relations , the operational definition of fluidity </S>",
    "<S> would imply @xmath87 whose form is the same as eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g_form ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> though the fitted @xmath72 is different from @xmath88 given in @xcite , the similarity of the form is suggestive . </S>",
    "<S> also , since the nonlocal effects captured by the fluidity model are most evident in quasi - static regions with enduring contacts , it seems the extended kinetic theory @xcite would be needed to further this connection , in which dense behavior beyond binary collisions is modeled . </S>",
    "<S> kinetic theory based justifications have previously been used to explain the apparent density- and temperature- dependent viscosity of dense granular flows in annular shear experiments @xcite , which foreshadows the functional form shown above . see supplemental materials for more analysis of the connection with these theories .    </S>",
    "<S> eyring s equation @xcite for activated processes has an analogy in the flow behavior of amorphous solids @xcite and has been considered previously in the context of granular flows @xcite . here , as in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we can view a material volume element as a collection of microscopic ` sites ' . </S>",
    "<S> each site able to undergo a shear event or ` hop ' has a barrier that must be overcome in order to do so . </S>",
    "<S> we express the element s total shear rate through the product : @xmath89 we assume @xcite that the fraction of potential sites for a shear event is a function of packing fraction , @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> it should approach @xmath91 at a jammed @xmath29 value , @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the second term can be expressed as the product of an attempt frequency for perturbations , @xmath93 , and the net probability , @xmath94 , that a perturbation causes a positive shear event vs a backward ( negative ) event on a site . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of attempts should be related to the fluctuational motion of the particles , so we assume that @xmath93 is given by @xmath95 , i.e. the ratio of fluctuation velocity to a characteristic length @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent of the probability of reaction is typically given by an arrhenius form , which depends on an energy barrier and a distribution of energies in an attempt , which depends on temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the limit of rigid particle interactions in granular systems complicate energetic considerations in this context , but one can instead express @xmath97 in terms of a critical shear stress barrier @xmath98 for forward or reverse shear events on a site , and a probability distribution for the stress fluctuation delivered by a perturbation , as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we similarly assume that @xmath99 , where the mean applied shear stress on the element , @xmath1 , is seen to bias the barrier , and that the cumulative distribution function for stress perturbations is exponentially decaying , as observed in @xcite , with mean on the order of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a constant factor . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we make the common assumption @xcite that the strain per flow event is a constant , @xmath102 , related to a typical ` jump distance ' . </S>",
    "<S> we can now multiply the three factors together and approximate @xmath103 to get @xmath104 because @xmath105 , the error of the linear approximation is always less than @xmath106 , and much smaller in quasi - static media . upon dividing by @xmath7 one obtains @xmath107 since @xmath11 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 are constant , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eyring_explain ] ) has the same form as eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g_form ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis suggests shear flow in granular media may be a fluctuation activated process .    supposing @xmath108 is the dominant contribution to @xmath31 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3:verification ] suggests a natural interpretation . when @xmath109 , the packing is open enough that all sites are able to flow , and @xmath108 holds at its maximum value in this range . as packing fraction increases above @xmath110 , the number of sites that have enough free volume for flow shows an expected monotonic decrease . </S>",
    "<S> the cohen - turnbull theory of free - volume distribution in glassy materials gives a similar behavior for the fraction of sites above a critical free - volume threshold @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g_pde ] ) evolves @xmath17 as a single state variable , it is natural to ask if the observed relation @xmath111 can be reduced to depend on only one state variable rather than two . </S>",
    "<S> for example , through the assumption of a local equation of state , one might suppose the pressure could be used to eliminate @xmath29 or @xmath25 from the system . </S>",
    "<S> in view of the data from the many geometries tested , we find this is not the case ( see supplemental material ) , suggesting the equation of state in inhomogeneous dense flow may need to include dependence on gradients and/or nonlocal influences . because @xmath29 and @xmath25 both play an irreducible and influential role in defining @xmath17 , a microphysical derivation for the granular fluidity pde , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g_pde ] ) , may involve combining dominant terms from a heat equation and a density evolution rule , though first attempts using kinetic theory forms produce a system more complex than eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g_pde ] ) . deriving eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g_pde ] ) from the microscopic description of @xmath17 remains crucial future work .    </S>",
    "<S> herein , we have proposed a relation connecting granular fluidity to granular velocity fluctuation and packing fraction . </S>",
    "<S> this relation is demonstrated in dem simulations of multiple configurations . </S>",
    "<S> all three descriptions of the granular fluidity field  ( i ) its operational definition ( @xmath26 ) extracted from dem simulations , ( ii ) its definition from the fluidity governing pde , and ( iii ) the new microphysical definition  match well with each other in multiple geometries under multiple conditions . </S>",
    "<S> granular fluidity could be related to a fluctuation activated process as a measure of the rate of the number of flowable microsites perturbed by attempts . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to compare the description herein to previous models for non - granular materials ( e.g. emulsions , suspensions ) , which evolve the ` standard ' fluidity @xmath112 ( inverse viscosity ) rather than @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> theories have previously suggested @xmath113 relates microscopically to the rate of plastic events @xcite , which has been correlated to shear - rate fluctuations in experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our result that a fluctuation variable is key as well in describing granular fluidity suggests a bridge between the different amorphous material classes . </S>"
