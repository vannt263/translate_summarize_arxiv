    "the absolute distance separating two bodies is a parameter of principal importance for the determination of dispersive forces ( van the der waals @xcite , casimir @xcite or more general casimir - lifshitz force @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute distance becomes difficult to determine when the separation gap approaches nanometer dimensions .",
    "this complication originates from the presence of surface roughness , which manifests itself on the same scale .",
    "in fact , when the bodies are brought into gentle contact they are still separated by some distance @xmath0 , which we call the distance upon contact due to surface roughness .",
    "we are interested in the dispersive forces when stronger chemical or capillary forces are eliminated . in this case",
    "@xmath0 has a special significance for adhesion , which is mainly due to van der waals forces across an extensive noncontact area @xcite .",
    "the distance @xmath0 is important for micro ( nano ) electro mechanical systems ( mems ) because stiction due to adhesion is the major failure mode in mems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the distance upon contact plays an important role in contact mechanics @xcite , is very significant for heat transfer @xcite , contact resistivity @xcite , lubrication , and sealing @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has also importance in the case of capillary forces and wetting @xcite , where knowledge of @xmath0 provides further insight of how adsorbed water wets a rough surface .",
    "the distance upon contact @xmath0 between a sphere and a plate @xcite plays a key role in modern precise measurements of the dispersion forces ( see @xcite for a review ) where @xmath0 is the main source of errors . in casimir force measurements @xmath0 is determined using electrostatic calibration . in this case the force dependence on the separation is known , and one can determine the absolute separation ( see resent discussions @xcite ) . even when the distance is not counted from the point of contact @xcite local realization of roughness as shown in this paper will contribute to uncertainty of the absolute separation .",
    "independent attempts to define @xmath0 were undertaken in experiments measuring the adhesion energy @xcite .",
    "it was proposed @xcite to take @xmath0 as the sum of the root mean square ( rms ) roughnesses of two surfaces upon contact .",
    "this definition is , however , restricted and can only be used for rough estimates as stressed in @xcite . obviously , the distance upon contact has to be defined by the highest asperities .    in this paper",
    "we propose a simple method for determination of @xmath0 from the roughness profiles of the two surfaces coming into contact . for two plates",
    "it is explicitly demonstrated that @xmath2 is scale dependent , where @xmath8 is the area of nominal contact .",
    "we discuss also application of our method to the sphere - plate configuration . in this case",
    "it is shown that @xmath0 determined from the electrostatic calibration can differ from that playing role in the dispersive force and the difference is scale ( separation ) dependent .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we report briefly the details of our film preparation and characterization . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] the roughness profiles in the plate - plate configuration are discussed and the main relation connecting @xmath0 with the size of the nominal contact is deduced .",
    "the sphere - plate configuration is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] together with uncertainty in @xmath0 .",
    "our conclusions are collected in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] .",
    "the surfaces we use in this study were gold films grown by thermal evaporation onto oxidized silicon wafers with thicknesses in the range @xmath9 and having different rms roughnesses . a polysterene sphere ( radius @xmath10 ) , attached on a gold coated cantilever , was first plasma sputtered with gold for electrical contact , and then a @xmath11 gold film grown on top of the initial coating .",
    "the deposited films were of uniform thickness and of isotropic surface morphology as was confirmed independently with atomic force and scanning electron microscopy on different locations .",
    "the surface profile was recorded with veeco multimode atomic force microscope ( afm ) using nanoscope v controller . to analyze the effect of scale dependence , megascans of large area up to @xmath12 were made and recorded with the lateral resolution of @xmath13 pixels .",
    "the maximal area , which we have been able to scan on the sphere , was @xmath14 ( @xmath15 pixels ) .",
    "all images were flattened with linear filtering ; for the sphere the parabolic filtering was used to exclude the effect of curvature .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the images of the @xmath16 film ( a ) and the sphere ( b ) on different scales .",
    "approximately 10 images of smaller size @xmath17 were recorded for each film and for the sphere to obtain the correlation length @xmath18 of the rough surfaces @xcite .",
    "finally , the electrostatic calibration was used for the determination of the cantilever spring constant and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "consider first two parallel plates , which can come into contact .",
    "a plate surface can be described by a roughness profile @xmath19 ( @xmath20 for body 1 or 2 ) , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the lateral coordinates .",
    "the averaged value over large area of the profile is zero , @xmath23 .",
    "then the local distance between the plates is @xmath24 where @xmath5 is the distance between the average planes .",
    "we can define the distance upon contact @xmath0 as the largest distance @xmath25 , for which @xmath26 becomes zero .",
    "it is well known from contact mechanics @xcite that the contact of two elastic rough plates is equivalent to the contact of a rough hard plate and an elastic flat plate with an effective young s modulus @xmath27 and a poisson ratio @xmath28 . in this paper",
    "we analyze the contact in the limit of zero load when both bodies can be considered as hard .",
    "this limit is realized when only weak adhesion is possible , for which the dispersive forces are responsible .",
    "strong adhesion due to chemical bonding or due to capillary forces is not considered here .",
    "this is not a principal restriction , but the case of strong adhesion has to be analyzed separately . equation ( [ loc_dis ] ) shows that the profile of the effective rough body is given by @xmath29 the latter means that @xmath30 is given by the combined image of the surfaces facing each other .    let @xmath31 be the size of the combined image .",
    "then , in order to obtain information on the scale @xmath32 , we divide this image on @xmath33 subimages . for each subimage",
    "we find the highest point of the profile ( local @xmath0 ) , and average all these values .",
    "this procedure gives us @xmath2 and the corresponding statistical error .",
    "megascans are very convenient for this purpose otherwise one has to collect many scans in different locations .    for the @xmath11 film above the @xmath34 film the result of this procedure",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "we took the maximum area to be @xmath35 .",

    "the inset demonstrates absence of the scale dependence for the rms roughness . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to understand the dependence @xmath2 let us assume that the size @xmath1 of the area of nominal contact is large in comparison with the correlation length , @xmath37 .",
    "it means that this area can be divided into a large number @xmath38 of cells .",
    "the height of each cell ( asperity ) can be considered as a random variable @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the probability to find @xmath39 smaller than some value @xmath40 can be presented in a general form @xmath41 where the `` phase '' @xmath42 is a nonnegative and nondecreasing function of @xmath40 .",
    "note that ( [ prob ] ) is just a convenient way to represent the data : instead of cumulative distributions @xmath43 we are using the phase @xmath42 .    for a given asperity the probability to find",
    "its height above @xmath0 is @xmath44 , then within the area of nominal contact one asperity will be higher than @xmath0 if @xmath45 this condition can be considered as an equation for the asperity height because due to a sharp exponential behavior the height is approximately equal to @xmath0 . to solve ( [ above_d0 ] ) we have to know the function @xmath42 , which can be found from the roughness profile .",
    "the cumulative distribution @xmath43 can be found from a roughness profile by counting pixels with the height below @xmath40 .",
    "then the `` phase '' can be calculated as @xmath46 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "it has to be noted that the function @xmath42 becomes more dispersive at large @xmath40 .",
    "this effect was observed for all surfaces we investigated .",
    "to solve eq .",
    "( [ above_d0 ] ) we have to approximate the large @xmath40 tail of @xmath42 by a smooth curve .",
    "any way of the data smoothing is equally good , and our method is not relied on specific assumptions about the probability distribution .",

    "[ fig4 ] , and the solution itself is the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",

    "other known distributions are not able satisfactory describe the data at all @xmath40 .",
    "asymptotically at large @xmath40 the data can be reasonably well fit with the generalized extreme value distributions gumbel or weibull @xcite .",
    "this fact becomes important if one has to know @xmath0 for the size @xmath1 , which is larger than the maximal scan size . in this case one",
    "has to extrapolate @xmath42 to large @xmath40 according to the chosen distribution . in this paper",
    "we are not doing extrapolation using only @xmath42 extracted directly form the megascans .",

    "the main graph shows the `` phase '' as a function of @xmath40 .",

    "the top inset presents the logarithm of the density function .",
    "the bottom inset shows the cumulative distribution .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the observed dependence @xmath2 can be understood intuitively .",
    "the probability to have one high asperity is exponentially small but the number of asperities increases with the area of nominal contact",
    ". therefore , the larger the contact area , the higher probability to find a high feature within this area .",
    "our result found in the limit of zero load will hold true if the elastic deformation of the highest asperity will be small ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "applying hertzian theory to an asperity of radius @xmath48 one finds the restriction on the load @xmath49 : @xmath50 if @xmath51 is the van der waals pressure ( @xmath52 is the hamaker constant ) then ( [ load ] ) for the @xmath53 parameters restricts @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath54 .",
    "this condition is true in the range of main interest . for the sphere - plane case ( see below ) eq . ( [ load ] ) can be modified accordingly but in general the physical contact is not assumed for the sphere - plate configuration .",
    "the other question of great practical importance is the distance upon contact between a sphere and a plate . in the experiments @xcite the sphere attached to a cantilever or an optical fibre",
    "approaches the plate .",
    "assuming that the sphere is large , @xmath55 , the local distance is @xmath56 where @xmath30 is the combined profile of the sphere and the plate .",

    "( [ d0_sph ] ) we used the combined images of the sphere and different plates .",
    "the origin ( @xmath59 ) was chosen randomly in different positions and then @xmath0 was calculated according to ( [ d0_sph ] ) .",

    "the last four rows were determined for @xmath63 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can estimate the same value theoretically .",
    "a circle of a finite area @xmath8 is important in eq .",
    "( [ d0_sph ] ) .",
    "asperities of the size @xmath18 are distributed homogeneously within this circle .",
    "then the averaged value of the second term in ( [ d0_sph ] ) is @xmath64 .",
    "the averaged maximal value of @xmath30 is the distance upon contact between two plates of the size @xmath1 .",
    "this distance is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ above_d0 ] ) . in this section",
    "we will denote it as @xmath65 not to mix with @xmath0 in the sphere - plate configuration .",
    "then one can find @xmath0 for the sphere - plate contact by maximizing ( [ d0_sph ] ) on @xmath1 : @xmath66.\\ ] ] the solution of this equation defines @xmath67 and the scale @xmath58 corresponding to the maximum .",
    "the values of @xmath67 and @xmath58 found from ( [ max_d0 ] ) are given in tab .",

    "we described @xmath0 as the value determined from the area @xmath68 and averaged over its different locations .",
    "determination of @xmath0 from the electrostatic measurements did not undergo this type of averaging . as a result it is sensitive to the local roughness realization near the contact location .",
    "this explains why the errors in @xmath62 are smaller : statistical variation of @xmath0 from place to place is not included in the errors of @xmath62 .",
    "very different local values of @xmath0 can be found and for this reason @xmath62 can deviate significantly from the mean value . choosing arbitrarily the contact locations in the image of the sphere and the 100 nm film we found , for example , that about 5% of the cases are in agreement with the measured value @xmath69 .",
    "one can imagine that the place of contact on the sphere has at least one asperity above the average . in the combined image the sphere dominates since it is rougher than the film , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "because the sphere is rigidly fixed on the cantilever the same feature will be in the area of contact for any other location or other film .",
    "already for the sphere above 400 nm film the high feature on the sphere will not play significant role because the roughness of the film , @xmath72 , is higher than that for the sphere . in this case",
    "we would expect that @xmath62 has to be in agreement with the averaged value found from the image that is precisely what happens .     in @xmath0 ( see text ) .",
    "the sphere in two positions is shown by the dashed ( contact ) and solid blue ( dark gray ) curves .",

    "the system under consideration is equivalent to a smooth sphere above a combined rough profile @xmath30 .",
    "the position of the average plane depends on the area of averaging @xmath8 especially for small scales @xmath1 . the profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] demonstrates different mean values in the left and right segments shown by the dashed black lines .",
    "both of these values deviate from the middle line for the scale @xmath74 ( solid black line ) .",

    "[ fig5 ] one can see that @xmath0 for @xmath1 and @xmath74 differ on @xmath76 . to be more precise we can define the uncertainty in @xmath0 as @xmath77 , where we understand @xmath0 as the value counted from the true average plane ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the distance between bodies is then @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the displacement from the contact point .",
