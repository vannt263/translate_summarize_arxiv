    "the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) is characterized by complex spatial distributions of density , temperature , and magnetic fields , as well as a turbulent velocity field that animates the whole system .",
    "the relative proportions of ism gas in different thermal / ionization phases , and their respective dynamical states , may reflect many contributing physical processes of varying importance throughout the milky way ( or external galaxies ) . even considering just the galaxy s atomic gas component , observable in hi emission and absorption ,",
    "a wide variety of temperatures and pervasive high - amplitude turbulence is inferred @xcite , and a number of different physical processes may collude or compete in establishing these conditions .    in the traditional picture of the ism , turbulence in atomic gas",
    "is primarily attributed to the lingering effects of supernova blast waves that sweep through the ism @xcite .",
    "densities and temperatures of atomic gas are expected to lie preferentially near either the warm or cold stable thermal equilibria available given heating primarily by the photoelectric effect on small grains @xcite .",
    "thermal instability ( ti ) is believed to play an important role in maintaining gas near the stable equilibria @xcite .    certain potential difficulties with this picture",
    "motivate an effort to explore effects not emphasized in the traditional model . in particular , because energetic stellar inputs are intermittent in space and time , while turbulence is directly or indirectly inferred to pervade the whole atomic ism , it is valuable to assess alternative spatially / temporally _ distributed _ turbulent driving mechanisms .",
    "candidate mechanisms recently proposed for driving turbulence include both ti @xcite and the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to uncertainties about the source of turbulence in hi gas , other puzzles surrounding hi temperatures ( e.g. @xcite ) have grown more pressing with recent observations @xcite .",
    "namely , the heiles and troland observations suggest that significant hi gas ( @xmath4 ) could be in the thermally - unstable temperature regime between 500 - 5000 k. using observational evidence from various tracers , @xcite has also recently argued that very large pressures and other large departures from dynamical and thermal equilibrium are common in the ism , and indicate rapid changes likely driven by turbulence . to assess and interpret this evidence theoretically",
    ", it is necessary to understand the nonlinear development of ti , the effects of independent dynamical ism processes on ti , and the ability in general of magnetohydrodyanmic ( mhd ) turbulence to heat and cool ism gas via shocks , compressions , and rarefactions .    in recent years",
    ", direct numerical simulation has become an increasingly important tool in theoretical investigation of the ism s structure and dynamics , and has played a key role in promoting the increasingly popular notion of the ism as a `` phase continuum '' . in mhd ( or hydrodynamic ) simulations , the evolution of gas in the computational domain is formalized in terms of time - dependent flow equations with appropriate source terms to describe externally - imposed effects .",
    "fully realistic computational ism models will ultimately require numerical simulations with a comprehensive array of physics inputs .",
    "recent work towards this goal that address turbulent driving and temperature / density probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) include the three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; and the two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulations of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . among other physics inputs ,",
    "all of these simulations include modeled effects of star formation , with either supernova - like or stellar - like localized heating events that lead to expanding flows .",
    "for some of these models , the cooling functions also permit ti in certain density regimes .",
    "since many of the individual processes affecting the ism s structure and dynamics are not well understood , in addition to comprehensive physical modeling , it is also valuable to perform numerical simulations that focus more narrowly on a single process , or on a few processes that potentially may interact strongly .",
    "this controlled approach can yield significant insight into the relative importance of multiple effects in complex systems such as the ism . using models that omit supernova and stellar energy inputs , it is possible to sort out , for example ,",
    "whether the appearance of phase continua in density / temperature pdfs requires localized thermal energy inputs , or can develop simply from the disruption of ti by moderate - amplitude turbulence such as that driven by mri .",
    "recent simulations that have focused on the nonlinear development of ti under ism conditions include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "previous simulations of mri in 2d and 3d have focused primarily on the situation in which the density is relatively uniform , for application to accretion disks ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in recent work , @xcite began study of mri in the galactic context using isothermal simulations , focusing on dense cloud formation due to the action of self - gravity on turbulently - compressed regions .    in this work ,",
    "we initiate a computational study aimed at understanding how density , temperature , velocity , and magnetic field distributions would develop in the diffuse ism in the absence of localized stellar energy input .",
    "of particular interest is the interaction between ti and mri .",
    "ti tends to produce a cloudy medium , and this cloudy medium may affect both the growth rate of mri and its dissipation rate , and hence the saturated - state turbulent amplitude that is determined by balancing these rates . on the other hand , the turbulence produced by mri may suppress and/or enhance ti by disrupting and/or initiating the growth of dense condensations .",
    "evaluation of quasi - steady - state properties such as the mean turbulent velocity amplitude and the distribution of temperatures will await 3d simulations . in the present work ,",
    "which employs 2d simulations , we focus on evaluation of our code s performance for studies of thermally bistable media , and on analysis of nonlinear development in models of pure ti , ti together with mri , and mri in a medium of pre - existing clouds .    in  2 , we describe our numerical methods and code tests . in  3 , we present results from simulations of thermally unstable gas without magnetic fields , and in  4 we present results of models",
    "in which magnetic fields and sheared rotation have been added so that mri occurs .",
    "finally , in  5 , we summarize our results , discuss their implications , and make comparisons to previous work .",
    "we integrate the time - dependent equations of magnetohydrodynamics using a version of the zeus-2d code @xcite .",
    "zeus uses a time - explicit , operator - split , finite difference method for solving the mhd equations on a staggered mesh , capturing shocks via an artificial viscosity .",
    "velocities and magnetic field vectors are face - centered , while energy and mass density are volume - centered .",
    "zeus employs the ct and moc algorithms @xcite to maintain @xmath5 and ensure accurate propagation of alfvn waves .    for the present study ,",
    "we have implemented volumetric heating and cooling terms , and a thermal conduction term .",
    "we also model the differential rotation of the background flow and the variation of the stellar / dark matter gravitational potential in the local limit with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the galactocentric radius of the center of our computational domain .",
    "the equations we solve are therefore :    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    all symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "the net cooling per unit mass is given by @xmath12 .",
    "we adopt the simple atomic ism heating and cooling prescriptions of @xcite , in which the cooling function , @xmath13 , is a piecewise power - law fit to the detailed models of @xcite .",
    "the heating rate , @xmath14 , is taken to be constant at 0.015 @xmath15 . in the tidal potential term of equation ( [ mom ] )",
    ", @xmath16 is the local dimensionless shear parameter , equal to unity for a flat rotation curve in which the angular velocity @xmath17 .",
    "the present set of simulations is 2d , with the computational domain representing a square sector in the radial - vertical ( @xmath18 ) plane . in the local frame ,",
    "the azimuthal direction @xmath19 becomes the @xmath20 coordinate axis ; @xmath21-velocities and magnetic field components are present in our models , but @xmath22 for all variables . to reduce diffusion from advection in the presence of background shear ,",
    "we apply the velocity decomposition method of @xcite .",
    "we employ periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath23-direction , and shearing - periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath24-direction @xcite .",
    "this framework allows us to incorporate realistic galactic shear , while avoiding numerical artifacts associated with simpler boundary conditions .    because cooling times can be very short , the energy equation update from the net cooling terms",
    "is solved implicitly using newton - raphson iteration . at the start of each iteration",
    "the time step is initially computed from the cfl condition using the sound speed , alfvn speed , and conduction parameter .",
    "this is followed by a call to the cooling subroutine .",
    "the change in temperature within each zone is limited to ten percent of its initial value .",
    "if this requirement is not met for all cells in the grid , the time step is reduced by a factor of two , and the implicit energy update is recalculated .",
    "tests with our cooling function show that this time step restriction could in principle become quite prohibitive if zones were far from thermal equilibrium . in practice , though , for our model simulations this is typically not the case , and the time step is reduced once or twice at most .",
    "the update from the conduction operator is solved explicitly , using a simple five point stencil for the spatial second derivative of temperature ( cf .",
    "@xcite equation 19.2.4 ) . in two dimensions",
    "the cfl condition is @xmath25/ ( 4\\mathcal{k})$ ] .",
    "as @xcite have recently pointed out , the importance of incorporating conduction in simulations which contain thermally unstable gas has been occasionally overlooked in past work . without conduction , the growth rates for thermal instability are largest at the smallest scales , and unresolved growth at the grid scale may occur .",
    "the inclusion of conduction , however , has a stabilizing effect on ti at small scales , and the conduction parameter can be adjusted to allow spatial resolution of ti on the computational grid . here , we treat @xmath26 as a parameter that may be freely specified for numerical efficacy ; we discuss the physical level of conduction in the ism below .",
    "the zeus mhd code has undergone extensive numerical testing and has been used in a wide variety of astrophysical investigations . in addition , we have tested the code without cooling and conduction and have found it can accurately reproduce the linear growth rates of the mri for an adiabatic medium ( see also @xcite ) . to test our implementation of the heating , cooling , and conduction terms , we performed 1d simulations to compare with the linear growth rates of the thermal instability @xcite .",
    "the models were initialized with eigenmodes of the instability , and three levels of conduction were chosen : @xmath27 .",
    "for these tests , the grid was 128 zones and the box size @xmath28 pc .",
    "the initial density and pressure were set to @xmath29 and @xmath30 , implying corresponding cutoffs for thermal instability ( `` field length '' ) , @xmath31 pc for our adopted cooling function ( see  3.1).^{-1/2}$ ] when @xmath32 function of @xmath33 .",
    "] in figure  [ fig1 ] we plot the growth rates from the simulations on top of the analytic curves .",
    "the numerical growth rates are obtained by measuring the logarithmic rate of change of the maximum density .",
    "the agreement between the analytic and numerical growth rates is quite good .",
    "this test confirms that the newly added cooling and conduction subroutines are working correctly , and is critical in assessing the performance of the code as applied to multi - phase ism simulations .",
    "note that at small scales ti is essentially isobaric , so that this test demonstrates the ability of the code to maintain near - uniform pressure via hydrodynamic flow to compensate for changes in temperature driven by the cooling term ( see eq .",
    "3 ) .    by comparison with simulations in which we set @xmath34",
    ", tests with non - zero @xmath35 also confirm that conduction provides a needed numerical stabilization .",
    "when conduction is omitted , growth rates for ti will always be greatest at the largest available wavenumbers .",
    "our 2d tests with @xmath34 have confirmed this is indeed the case : simulations in which ti is seeded from random perturbations form high density clouds which are the size of a single grid zone .",
    "further 2d tests show that provided @xmath36 is resolved by at least 8 zones , this grid - scale growth is suppressed . for the models we shall present ,",
    "the conduction parameter and grid resolution were chosen such that we can adequately resolve all modes for which ti is unstable .    because we are modeling a medium containing very large density contrasts",
    ", it is desirable to assess the evolution of contact discontinuities between the high and low density regions , representing cold and warm phases in pressure equilibrium .",
    "the diffusive smearing of contact discontinuities is an inherent limitation of all finite difference codes , but the numerical problem can be magnified with the inclusion of a thermally bistable net cooling function . as these contact discontinuities are advected through the grid , upstream and downstream zones adjacent to the discontinuity are set to intermediate densities which may be thermally unstable .",
    "thermally unstable gas adjoining the initial contact rapidly heats or cools to reach a pressure different from the initial equilibrium , and this can potentially introduce additional dynamics to the problem .    to explore this numerical issue for the problem at hand",
    ", we have performed 1d advection tests of relaxed profiles of high density clouds in a low density ambient medium .",
    "the resolution is 512 zones for all runs .",
    "we define @xmath37 , i.e. the number of zones in a field length at the mean density , giving a measure of the resolution at scales for which conduction is important .",
    "we vary @xmath26 so that @xmath38 varies from 8 to 32 in powers of 2 .",
    "the initial conditions consist of a top - hat function of high and low density set to be in approximate pressure equilibrium .",
    "the exact equilibrium state is the solution of @xmath39 from equation ( [ energy ] ) , and is different for each value of @xmath35 .",
    "initial oscillations in pressure , velocity , and density gradually decay , and we consider the profile to be relaxed when these oscillations reach approximately one percent of their value early in the simulation . after a relaxed `` cloud '' profile",
    "is achieved the velocity of all cells is set to a constant value comparable to the sound speed , and the `` cloud '' is advected through the grid twice .",
    "profiles at the end of these runs are compared to the initial relaxed equilibrium profile in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "notice that as @xmath40 increases so does the number of zones over which the contact discontinuity is spread ; the results clearly show that the profile is preserved more faithfully as @xmath40 increases from 8 to 32 . for comparison",
    "we also show results from the original zeus-2d code , without conduction and cooling .",
    "it is clear that running higher levels of conduction at a given resolution has the advantage of smearing contact discontinuities over an increasing number of zones , thus improving the performance of the code in the advection tests .",
    "however , increasing @xmath26 has the disadvantage of inhibiting thermal instability at larger and larger spatial scales , such that only very large scale structures can develop from thermal instability .",
    "as we are interested in how wavelengths of growing mri modes in a cloudy medium may be affected by the distances between condensations , it is undesirable to limit the available dynamic range for this exploration . for @xmath38 = 32 at a resolution of 256 zones , @xmath41 is 12.5pc , and the maximum ti growth rate occurs at 29 pc , about one third of our box .",
    "a second disadvantage of increasing @xmath26 is that conduction quickly begins to set the time step for the simulations .",
    "so , we make the practical choice of setting @xmath42 . at resolution of @xmath43 , and a box size of 100 pc , we then set @xmath44 , to yield @xmath45 pc .",
    "this compromise choice allows us to resolve ti developing from the initial conditions , to maintain advection profiles within @xmath46 , and to have adequate numbers and resolution of the condensations that form to represent a cloudy medium in a meaningful way .",
    "the true thermal conduction level in the ism is not well known observationally , and must be affected by the fractional ionization ( since electrons are highly mobile when present ) and magnetic field geometry .",
    "a minimum level of conduction for the atomic ism is that of neutral hydrogen gas , @xmath47 @xcite . at 2000",
    "k , @xmath48 , about a factor of one hundred smaller than our value , such that @xmath49 would be reduced by a factor @xmath50 .",
    "the use of a smaller conduction parameter would not , however , significantly alter our main results . the most unstable wavelength for ti ( see figure  [ fig1 ] )",
    "would be significantly smaller , 3 pc compared to 12 pc for our adopted @xmath26  which would reduce the size scale of the clouds in the initial condensation phase .",
    "however , the growth rate of ti for the most unstable wavelength would increase by only 15% compared to our models .",
    "the evolution towards more massive clouds via agglomeration would proceed similarly to the results we have found .",
    "in addition , the overall tendency to maintain a two - phase medium after ti has developed , as well as the characteristics we identify for mri growth in a cloudy medium , would not be affected by the initial sizes of clouds that form .",
    "various heating and cooling processes in the ism define a thermal equilibrium pressure - density curve on which energy is radiated at the same rate it is absorbed .",
    "perturbations from the equilibrium curve will either be stable or unstable depending on its local shape @xcite .",
    "our adopted equilibrium curve @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] ( together with contours of temperature corresponding to transitions in the cooling function , and with scatter plots from our first simulation ) .",
    "gas in the region above the curve has net cooling ( @xmath51 ) , and gas below the curve net heating ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "when gas on the equilibrium curve in the warm phase ( phase `` f '' , at t @xmath53 6102 k ) is perturbed to higher ( lower ) temperatures , there is net cooling ( heating ) and the gas returns to equilibrium .",
    "the same situation applies to gas in the cold phase ( phase `` h '' , at t @xmath54 141 k ) . at intermediate temperatures ( phase ``",
    "g '' , 313 k @xmath54 t @xmath54 6102 k ) , however , perturbations from equilibrium to higher ( lower ) temperatures results in net heating ( cooling ) , and the gas continues heating ( cooling ) until it reaches equilibrium in phase f ( h ) .",
    "this is the physical basis for ti , which was first analyzed comprehensively by @xcite .",
    "thermal instability has long been believed to play an important role in structuring the ism because at typical volume - averaged atomic densities estimated for the ism ( e.g. @xmath55 from @xcite ) gas in thermal equilibrium would lie on the unstable portion of the curve .",
    "thus , much of the mass of the ism in the milky way and similar galaxies is believed to be in cold clouds or a warm intercloud medium , the two stable neutral atomic phases ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent theoretical work has emphasized that dynamical processes may drive gas away from these two stable phases , potentially explaining observationally - inferred temperatures that depart from equilibrium expectations ; we shall discuss these issues in ",
    "[ discuss ] .",
    "it is , nevertheless , of significant interest to study in detail how ti develops nonlinearly to establish a two - phase cloudy medium in the absence of other potential effects such as localized heating , impacts from large - scale shocks , or stresses associated with mhd turbulence .",
    "results of these carefully - controlled `` pure ti '' simulations are valuable for characterizing the timescale to develop a two - phase medium as well as its structural and kinetic properties .",
    "`` pure ti '' models also represent a baseline for comparison of models incorporating more complex physics .",
    "once the particular form of the cooling curve has been chosen , the development of ti is primarily a function of four parameters : the cooling time , @xmath56 , the heating time , @xmath57 , the sound crossing time , @xmath58 , and the conduction length scale , @xmath49 .",
    "the cooling time depends on the specific cooling function ; for the cooling curve we adopt @xcite , in varying temperature regimes we have @xmath59    the heating time , @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "we can also define an effective cooling / heating time as @xmath62 ; at thermal equilibria , @xmath63 becomes infinite .",
    "the sound crossing time over distance @xmath64 is @xmath65    in figure  [ times ] , we plot @xmath63 , and @xmath58 for @xmath66 as a function of density for @xmath67 . for a range of densities @xmath68 , the sound crossing",
    "time is significantly shorter than the effective cooling time ; otherwise @xmath58 is typically more than an order of magnitude longer than @xmath63 .    to simulate thermal instability under conditions representative of the general diffuse ism",
    ", we adopt an initial density of @xmath69 and set the initial pressure to @xmath3 ; all velocities are initially set to zero . random pressure perturbations with an amplitude less than 0.1% are added to seed the ti .",
    "the gas is initially in a weakly cooling state , since the equilibrium pressure corresponding to @xmath70 is @xmath71 .",
    "the simulation proceeds for 470 myr , corresponding to two galactocentric orbits at the solar circle .      the initial development of ti proceeds quickly . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show four snapshots at different times of the density distribution alongside scatter plots of pressure versus density overlayed on the equilibrium cooling curve .",
    "structure begins to form at about @xmath72 , and density contrasts continue to increase at constant pressure until @xmath73 as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the fourier transform of the density distribution at this time , figure  [ den_pow ] , shows that the majority of the power is concentrated at @xmath74 . allowing for geometrical factors ,",
    "this is consistent with the one - dimensional linear theory prediction that the most unstable wavelength is @xmath75 for our chosen value of conduction .",
    "a network of filaments briefly forms at about 18 myr connecting the regions of highest density , with flow moving along the filaments increasing the number density to as high as @xmath76 . by 23",
    "myr the dense gas has collected in condensations and has relaxed to approximate thermal equilibrium .",
    "the size scale of the cold clumps is initially only a few parsecs and is relatively uniform .",
    "however , random motions of the newly formed clouds leads to merging and disassociation ; conductive evaporation at its boundaries can also alter the shape of a clump . by the end of the simulation , at 474 myr ,",
    "the typical cloud size has increased significantly to @xmath77 , though a number of smaller clouds either remain from the initial ti development or have formed as a result of disassociation .    in figure  [ figxa ] ,",
    "panels a , b , and c , we plot the volume - weighted and mass - weighted density probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the first three snapshots from figure  [ fig3 ] . at t=14 myr , in panel a , all of the gas is in the unstable range .",
    "already , though , in panel b , after 18 myr , the distribution has begun to separate into two distinct phases . at t=18 myr ,",
    "69% , 28% , and 3% of the gas by volume is in the f ( warm ) , g ( unstable ) , and h ( cold ) phases respectively , which are defined by our cooling curve as the ranges @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , respectively . by mass these proportions",
    "are reversed to 29% , 23% , and 49% , respectively . from about 100 myr through the end of the simulation ,",
    "the distribution of cloud sizes evolves , but the pdf remains relatively unchanged , with 12% , 2% , and 86% of the mass residing in the f , g , and h phases .",
    "we also performed the same simulation , but increased the resolution to @xmath81 .",
    "the conduction coefficient is not changed , so @xmath82 .",
    "we find similar results overall .",
    "in particular , the mass - weighted density pdfs are compared in panel d of figure  [ figxa ] . these pdfs exhibit no significant differences , confirming the robustness of our results .      alongside the images of density in figure  [ fig3 ] we show scatter plots of @xmath83 against @xmath84 for all zones in the grid at the same times .",
    "in the initial state , pressure is constant , and @xmath58 at 5 pc ( @xmath85 the length of the fastest - growing ti mode ) is shorter than @xmath56 ( see figure  [ times ] ) . towards the low density warm phase , @xmath86 , and gas parcels in regions undergoing rarefaction",
    "are able to heat nearly isobarically .",
    "thus , all zones at densities lower than the mean are filled with an intercloud medium that maintains spatially nearly uniform pressure . for gas parcels undergoing compression and net cooling , as @xmath87 becomes large , @xmath88 , so the gas tends to cool towards the thermal equilibrium curve at a faster rate than the flow is able to readjust dynamically .",
    "after gas parcels reach near thermal equilibrium in the cold phase , they continue to be compressed until pressure equilibrium with the warm medium is re - established . over time , the average pressure in the simulation box decreases due to radiation from the cold phase .    because the scatter plots in figure  [ fig3 ] contain a large number of points , many fall in the unstable range , although the actual amount of material there is small . to quantify this , in figure  [ figxb ]",
    "we plot mass - weighted and volume - weighted temperature pdfs at times corresponding to the snapshots in figure  [ fig3 ] . as with the density pdf , the distribution is separates into two distinct phases in panel b at 18 myr , and remains so for the duration of the simulation .",
    "thermal instability is a dynamic process , and a number of recent works have proposed that ti may help contribute to exciting turbulence in the ism . in figure  [ fig3a ]",
    "we plot the mass - weighted velocity dispersions for gas in the f , g , and h phases separately .",
    "for all phases , the largest velocities occur during the condensation stage at early times ( 10 - 20 myr ) , corresponding to about 5 times the @xmath89-folding time of the dominant linear instability .",
    "the peak velocity is about 0.45 @xmath90 for the unstable ( g ) phase , and is @xmath91 for the two stable phases . at later times",
    "the velocity dispersion in each phase remains relatively constant , with the largest value ( 0.35 @xmath90 ) for phase g , next largest ( 0.25 @xmath92 ) for the warm phase , f , and smallest ( 0.15 @xmath93 ) for the cold phase , h. the standard deviation of the total velocity dispersion is typically 0.15 @xmath94 .",
    "for comparison , typical sound speeds of the f , g , and h phases are 7 - 8 @xmath92 , 1 - 5 @xmath92 and 0.6 - 1 @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "thus , the mean turbulent velocities are all subsonic .",
    "in a series of four papers , balbus & hawley presented the first linear analysis and numerical simulations of mri in the context of an astrophysical disk @xcite .",
    "the physical basis for the instability is relatively simple , and there are two requirements for the instability to be present : a differentially rotating system with decreasing angular velocity as one moves outward through the disk , and a weak magnetic field ( strong magnetic fields have a stabilizing effect ) .",
    "as fluid elements are displaced outward ( inward ) the magnetic field resists shear and tries to keep the fluid moving at its original velocity . due to these magnetic stresses ,",
    "fluid elements gain ( lose ) angular momentum , the centrifugal force becomes too large ( small ) to maintain equilibrium at the new position , and the fluid element moves farther outward ( inward ) .",
    "this leads to the transport of angular momentum outward through the disk .    for a complete linear analysis of the mri in 2d",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite . here",

    "the maximum growth rate occurs when @xmath101 i.e. @xmath102 for @xmath103 ; here the growth rate is @xmath104 .",
    "the highest wavenumber for which axisymmetric mri exists when @xmath105 is @xmath106    we have tested the code without cooling and conduction , and found that it can accurately reproduce the predicted linear growth rates of the mri .",
    "we do not detail the results here ; instead we refer the reader to @xcite for a complete analysis of similar models .    based on the linear dispersion relation , for sufficiently weak magnetic fields , modes with a range of @xmath107 ( and also @xmath108 ) may grow .",
    "the smallest permissible wavenumber for a simulation is @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the vertical dimension of the computational box . at late times in 2d axisymmetric simulations @xcite , mri",
    "becomes dominated by a `` channel '' solution corresponding to the smallest permissible vertical wavenumber , i.e. with flow moving towards the inner regions of the disk on one ( vertical ) half of the grid , and flow moving towards the outer regions in the other ( vertical ) half of the grid .",
    "this pure `` channel flow '' is unphysical ; for a 3d system it is subject to nonaxisymmetric parasitic instabilities @xcite . in 3d",
    "non - axisymmetric simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) the channel solution forms at early times , but later develops into a fully turbulent flow .    the mri has primarily been studied in the context of accretion disks , but can be important in any differentially rotating disk system provided the magnetic fields are not too strong .",
    "in addition to axisymmetric modes , nonaxisymmetric mri modes can also grow directly ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite eqs .",
    "80 , 81 for instantaneous growth rates and instability threshold criteria in various limits ) .",
    "the axisymmetric mode with wavelength @xmath111 is the most difficult to stabilize as @xmath112 increases ; from equation ( [ maxkmri ] ) , taking @xmath113 , @xmath103 , a disk scale height @xmath114=150 pc and a uniform density @xmath115 , mri will be present provided @xmath116 . for the milky way ,",
    "this is consistent with the observed solar - neighborhood estimate @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "if a multi - phase system behaves similarly to the corresponding uniform - density medium , then we may expect mri to be important in the galactic ism . here , we explore how mri development can be affected by strong non - uniformity in the density structure .      to study nonlinear development of the mri in a nonuniform medium , we first perform a simulation identical to the ti model run described in   [ ti ] , but now include magnetic fields and sheared rotation .",
    "all hydrodynamical variables are initialized as described in   [ ti ] .",

    "we plot the mass - weighted temperature pdf of the ti + mri model 800 myr , and the same quantity for the ti run at 474 myr .",
    "we do not expect that the pdf for the ti run would evolve significantly if the simulation had been continued to 800 myr .",
    "evidently , the dynamical flows induced by the mri can significantly affect the temperature distribution .",

    "since the 2d channel solution would break up in a real 3d disk due to parasitic instabilities @xcite , we do not expect the late - time effects seen in our models to have direct implications for the temperature distribution in the diffuse ism .",
    "they illustrate , however , the more generic point that spatially - varying rotational shear coupled to magnetic fields can create stresses that force gas away from the stable equilibrium phases .",
    "we shall discuss this further , highlighting differences that might be expected for 3d mri , in ",
    "[ discuss ] .",
    "important questions for assessing mri development in a cloudy medium are how the spatial- and time - scales of the fastest - growing modes differ compared to those in single - phase counterpart systems .",
    "we measure mri mode amplitudes in the simulations by taking the fourier transform of @xmath129 as a function of time , from which we can calculate the growth rates .",
    "the @xmath130 and 3 mode amplitudes are plotted in figure  [ fig_ti_mhd_mode ] .",
    "there is not an obvious linear stage from which we can measure the growth rate , but between 284 and 470 myr the average @xmath131 growth rate is about 0.28 @xmath132 , compared to the predicted rate of 0.34 @xmath132 at the average density of the model . at the average density linear theory predicts that the most unstable mode is at @xmath133 , with a growth rate of 0.50 @xmath132 , and the @xmath134 mode is unstable as well , with a predicted growth rate of 0.41 @xmath132 . between 284 and 470 myr we measure a mean growth rate for the @xmath133 and @xmath134 modes to be 0.12 @xmath132 and 0.18 @xmath132 , respectively . at the density of the warm medium , only the @xmath131 mode is predicted to be unstable in our simulations , with a growth rate of 0.45 @xmath132 .",
    "thus , growth rates of available modes appear somewhat lower than they would be for a medium at either the mean density or the density of the warm medium . in addition , initial growth does not show the clear dominance of a single fastest growing mode that is evident in comparison adiabatic test simulations for a single - phase medium .",
    "however , at late times , the @xmath131 mode grows to exceed the other low - order modes , similarly to the findings of @xcite for a single - phase medium .      because the initial mri growth in the previous model may be strongly affected by lingering dynamical effects of ti , it is of interest to consider mri development in a medium which contains two distinct phases from the outset . in our next simulation",
    "we therefore begin with a two phase medium in approximate equilibrium , rather than developing a two phase medium from thermally unstable gas .",
    "we embed 59 high density clouds in a low density ambient medium such that the average density is the same as that of previous ti simulations . to set up the initial conditions allowing for conduction at cloud / intercloud interfaces , we first create `` template '' cloud profiles by embedding a single high density cold cloud in a low density warm medium and evolving until a thermally- and dynamically - relaxed state",
    "is reached .",
    "this profile ( density , pressure and velocity ) is then copied to randomly chosen locations on the grid , with the condition that cloud centers must be at least 20 zones apart .",
    "we initialize the magnetic field after this `` cloud embedding '' procedure .",
    "the simulation is then evolved as the mri develops .    in figure  [ gmc_ave ]",
    "we show three snapshots from the `` cloud + mri '' simulation , along with mass - weighted density pdfs .",
    "the mri takes about 500 myr until its development begins to become apparent , as can be seen in the poloidal field lines at 464 myr in figure  [ gmc_ave ] . at 701 myr",
    "many of the clouds have merged and have significant velocities as the mri channel solution begins to take hold .",
    "initially the mass weighted density pdf shows almost no gas in the unstable range , but as the mri begins to develop , this phase begins to become populated , and the pdf becomes very similar to those from the ti + mri simulations .",
    "perhaps the most interesting results from this `` cloud + mri '' simulation are the behavior of the mode amplitudes and growth rates . initially the clouds contain negligible velocities , and are in what would be a steady state if magnetic fields were not present .",
    "we might expect , then , to find `` cleaner '' mri growth rates than for the ti + mri runs .",
    "the mode amplitudes for @xmath130 , and 3 are plotted in figure  [ gmc_ave_mode ] .",
    "initially the @xmath133 mode is dominant and shows approximate linear growth between 300 myr - 700 myr , with an average growth rate of 0.34 @xmath132 , compared to the predicted rate 0.50 @xmath132 at the average density .",
    "the @xmath131 mode also shows approximate linear growth with an average rate of 0.47 @xmath132 measured from 450 myr - 900 myr , and becomes the dominant mode at around 800 myr . at the density of the warm medium",
    "the theoretical growth rate of the @xmath131 mode is 0.45 @xmath132 , and at the average density it is 0.34 @xmath132 .",
    "the @xmath134 growth rate , measured between 400 myr and 800 myr is 0.33 @xmath132 , which we can compare to the predicted value at the average density of 0.41 @xmath132 .",
    "thus , similarly to the ti + mri model , growth rates are slightly lower than they would be in a medium with the same mean density .",
    "there is , however , a longer period of dominance by the mode with the fastest expected growth rate .    for comparison we also performed an mri simulation with cooling and conduction disabled , initially at uniform density and seeded with the velocity and pressure profiles from the initial state of the previous `` cloud + mri '' simulation ; we also performed zero - conduction , zero - cooling test simulations seeded with random perturbations .",
    "the growth rates are in reasonable agreement between these simulations , although the case directly seeded with random perturbations had cleaner growth of mode amplitudes .",
    "most importantly , we find that rather than @xmath133 predominating as we found in the `` cloud + mri '' simulation , the @xmath134 mode in the single - phase comparison model is dominant until late time .",
    "this suggests that the initial perturbations are strongest at @xmath134 , but the presence of the multi - phase medium in the `` cloud + mri '' model significantly inhibits the growth of this mode because the inertial load varies strongly over a wavelength for @xmath134 .",
    "there are a number of ways mri growth rates and preferred scales could be affected by the influence of a cloudy background density structure , and signs of these effects are evident in our simulations .",
    "first , both growth rates and preferred scales are dependent on the alfvn speed , which is a function of density .",
    "the cold , dense clouds will be mri unstable at small scales compared to the larger preferred scales of the warm , low density , ambient medium . for fixed magnetic field strength , mri wavelengths are inversely proportional to density .",
    "thus , mri wavelengths in cold , dense gas will be a few parsecs , while mri wavelengths in warm , diffuse gas will be several tens of parsecs . although the mri wavelengths in dense gas may be smaller than individual cold clouds , permitting initial rapid growth , further development of the small - scale instability is limited by clouds small radial extent .",
    "long term mri development must therefore have characteristic wavelengths representative of either the average density conditions or the pervasive low - density warm , intercloud gas .",
    "this expectation is indeed consistent with our results .",
    "as seen in figures  [ fig3sf ] and [ gmc_ave ] , both the diffuse gas and the cold clouds participate together in an overall large - scale flow .",
    "the cold clouds frequently are the sites of strong kinks in the magnetic field .",
    "one might also expect the preferred scales for mri to be affected by cloud spacing .",
    "if cloud spacing is small compared to a given wavelength , then the mri growth rate might be expected to be similar to that under average density conditions .",
    "thus , if the fastest - growing wavelength at the mean density is large compared to cloud spacing along a field line then this might be expected to be the dominant wavelength .",
    "this situation is indeed evident in the second frame ( 464 myr ) of figure  [ gmc_ave ] , in which the @xmath133 mode dominates , even though , as described above , the input perturbation spectrum is such that the @xmath134 mode would dominate if the density were uniform . on the other hand , if fewer , more massive clouds exist , cloud separations will be larger , which could suppress mri growth at wavelengths shorter than cloud spacings and encourage mri development on the largest scales .",
    "evidence of this effect can be seen in the third panel ( 474 myr ) of figure  [ fig3sf ] .",
    "finally , if total mass is distributed very unevenly with magnetic flux , then mri may develop more rapidly and at longer wavelengths in regions where there is a comparatively low inertial load . in simulations ( not shown ) we have performed which have alternating radial zones of high and low mass loading on field lines ( initiated with cold clouds at intersections in a cartesian grid ) , we indeed see this effect .",
    "development of mri in the low - inertia `` pure warm '' phase is , however , checked when the radially - moving flow collides with the high - inertia cold clouds .    to test",
    "whether the growth rate of the smaller - scale k=2 mode ( essentially near the lower wavelength limit for behavior as at a single average density ) could be enhanced in ti+mri models , we also performed an additional random ti simulations in which a @xmath133 perturbation was added shortly after the initial condensation phase .",
    "the perturbation was added at about the 20 percent level in @xmath135 .",
    "for the first 500 myr the @xmath133 mode is strongest with a growth rate of 0.36 @xmath132 .",
    "after 500 myr the k=1 mode , with a growth rate of 0.47 @xmath132 , is again dominant .    taken together , the simulations of this section show that the development of the mri in the presence of a cloudy medium has modest differences compared to the corresponding development in a single phase medium at the average density .",
    "the dominant wavelengths are similar to those predicted by linear theory at mean - density conditions , and growth rates are also similar , but slightly smaller .",
    "the spacings between clouds affects which among the low-@xmath136 modes dominates the power during the exponential - growth phase . at very late times",
    "the @xmath124 mode is dominant in all simulations , consistent with the ultimate dominance of this channel flow in the single - phase models of @xcite .",
    "thermal and magnetorotational instabilities may play a major role in determining the physical properties of the diffuse ism . in regions far from active star formation or a recent supernova explosion , ti and mri may even be the primary processes driving structure and dynamics in the ism on scales @xmath137 pc .",
    "the pdfs of gas density and temperature , the characteristic sizes , shapes , and spatial distributions of cloudy structures , and the amplitudes and spectral properties of turbulent velocities and magnetic fields may all be strongly influenced by ti and mri .",
    "in addition , development and saturation of ti and mri may be strongly interdependent . in this paper",
    ", we have initiated a study of these important processes using numerical mhd simulations .",
    "the current work focuses on code tests and 2d models using a microphysics implementation appropriate for the atomic ism .",

    "in other recent work @xcite simulations of ti using spectral algorithms ( with explicit diffusive terms in the equations of motions ) appear to have difficulty reproducing the analytic growth rates in some circumstances .",

    "<S> both the ti+mri and cloud+mri models show that mri develops within a few galactic orbital times , just as for a uniform medium </S>",
    "<S> . the mean separation between clouds can affect which mri mode dominates the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> provided intercloud separations do not exceed half the mri wavelength , we find the mri growth rates are similar to those for the corresponding uniform medium . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the possibility , if low cloud volume filling factors increase mri dissipation times compared to those in a uniform medium , that mri - driven motions in the ism could reach amplitudes comparable to observed hi turbulent linewidths . </S>"
