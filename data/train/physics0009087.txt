    "in this paper we summarize the present status on energy spread measurement and control in the jefferson lab nuclear physics accelerator called cebaf .",
    "a schematic diagram of cebaf appears in fig .",
    "[ cebafacc ] and a summary of relevant beam parameters is given in table  [ cebafpar ] , where all sizes are _ rms _ quantities .",
    "cw beam , originating in the injector , is recirculated up to five times through each linac .",
    "the beam may be directed into up to three experimental halls simultaneously , the beam current in the halls being at the third subharmonic of the accelerator operating frequency of 1497 mhz . because of the low charge - per - bunch at even the highest operating current , collective effects are not an important source of energy spread in cebaf .",
    "[ cebafacc ] locates some of the feedback system hardware , discussed in section 6 below .",
    ".cebaf accelerator parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ momod ]",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , sources of bunch energy centroid fluctuations are corrected by a fast digital feedback system @xcite .",
    "the system corrects beam position and energy near the targets of the nuclear physics experiments utilizing energy measurements obtained from the bend magnets which deliver the beam to the various halls , see fig .",
    "[ cebafacc ] .",
    "the system is capable of suppressing beam motion in the frequency band from 0 to 80 hz and also performs narrow band suppression at the first twelve power line harmonics .",
    "the system operates with a 2.1 khz sampling rate and utilizes two vme board computers to compute the corrections .",
    "energy corrections are fed back as analogue signals to the gradient set points in the rf controls of a few cavities in the linac called vernier cavities .    for the standard optics in cebaf , the horizontal dispersion is maximum in the middle of the bend magnets delivering the beam to the halls .",
    "its value is approximately 4 m , meaning position fluctuations at 10 ppm correspond to 40 @xmath0 m of beam motion .",
    "the feedback system suppresses the fluctuations to around 20 @xmath0 m , limited by bpm noise @xcite .",
    "the beam noise to be corrected is primarily at frequencies of 60 hz and its first few harmonics .",
    "because the energy information is so closely tied to the magnetic fields in the beam delivery lines to the halls , a question arises about the stability of the magnetic fields themselves at the 10@xmath1 level . the total magnetic field at several points within the magnets",
    "have been verified to be stable to 10 ppm , and the power supplies deliver current having similarly small fluctuations .",
    "recently , we have installed a magnetic flux loop monitor through the dipole strings to the halls .",
    "this monitor will provide better quantitative information than we currently possess on residual fluctuations in the magnets , and will be able to address the issue of magnet stability directly .",
    "the accelerator is equipped with slow wire scanners using 22 @xmath0 m diameter tungsten wires .",
    "beam profiles for currents in the 2 to 5 @xmath0a range can be accurately measured once a minute with such scanners .",
    "more recently , we have developed a profile monitor that can measure even the most intense beams using forward optical transition radiation ( otr ) @xcite .",
    "a very thin ( 1/4 @xmath0 m ) carbon foil inserted into the beam path is not invasive to physics experiments for most cebaf energies and currents .",
    "presently , otr monitors are installed in each of the experimental hall a and c beam transport lines at the high dispersion points of the beam optics .",
    "these monitors provide the experiments and the accelerator with 5 hz measurement rates for each instrument by using a common image processing hardware . a dedicated software , developed under the epics @xcite control system , multiplexes up to four video input channels connected to a single maxvideo image processing board @xcite .",
    "the global processing speed is 10 hz , 5 hz for each of the two otr monitors .",
    "the hall a otr measures beams in the 1 to 180 @xmath0a operational range ; in hall c , the dynamic range extends down to 0.1 @xmath0a .",
    "the resolution of these monitors is limited by the ccd camera to about 2 pixels .",
    "this amounts to approximately 70 @xmath0 m of _ rms _ beam size .",
    "[ li2000f3 ] shows that the energy spread is relatively stable and below @xmath2 for a wide range of beam currents .",
    "the horizontal size , measured at the 4 m dispersion point , is mostly due to the energy spread . neglecting the betatron beam size , 40 @xmath0 m , and the camera resolution , 70 @xmath0 m , overestimates the actual energy spread by less than 25% .",
    "continuous small energy spread became an operational requirement at cebaf in dec .",
    "1999 , for a hypernuclear experiment housed in hall a , and continued until may 2000 with a similar experiment in hall c. both experiments ran simultaneously during one month last march , with 2-pass beam for hall a and a 4-pass beam for hall c. delivering two beams with tight energy spread and energy stability requirements instead of one proved demanding .",
    "the energy requirements for each experiment were similar : @xmath3 , with energy stability better than @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , hall a needed the transverse beam sizes at the target to be less than 200 @xmath0 m but greater than 100 @xmath0 m and a beam position stable within 250 @xmath0 m .",
    "the energy spread requirements have been routinely achieved for the hall under feedback control . because the feedback system can correct the energy fluctuations only in a single hall as presently configured , there were uncertainties that the spread in the other hall would remain small .",
    "[ li2000f4 ] shows energy spreads and relative energies in the hall c beam recorded over a 2-week period , with hall c transport line providing the energy corrections to the energy feedback system .",
    "small energy spreads were delivered throughout the period to hall c , however drifts led to energy spread increases in the hall a beam , as seen in fig .",
    "[ li2000f4i ] .            throughout the experiments in either hall , the energy spread and stability of both beams were continuously recorded .",
    "the otr monitors have been critical in this task .",
    "they were initially too cumbersome to be easily used by all operator crews .",
    "the implementation of scripts that periodically check and adjust the camera illumination , that initialize the image processing board according to the beam , and that set a  data valid \" flag quickly improved the instrument availability to 95% @xcite .",
    "after these improvements , the machine crews were able to correct quickly unacceptable energy spreads , usually without interrupting beam delivery .",
    "we are planning to improve the energy spread monitoring for two reasons : 1 ) at lower energies ( @xmath51.2 gev ) , the beam current had to be lowered to under 50 @xmath0a to have acceptable radiation levels on sensitive beam - line equipment .",
    "2 ) experiments scheduled in 2002 require monitoring an energy spread of @xmath6 .",
    "as an alternate to otr monitoring , we are planning to use synchrotron light beam monitoring , which is less invasive to the experimenters .",
    "however , the resolution of such a device is limited to about 100 @xmath0 m in the visible using the bending magnets of the hall transport lines .",
    "we are starting a development effort in order to reach about 30 @xmath0 m resolution utilizing the uv synchrotron emission .",
    "we have demonstrated the ability of a cebaf - type accelerator to produce beams with small energy spreads over long periods of time .",
    "we ensure that the energy spread remains small by : ( 1 ) ensuring the bunch length out of the injector is small , ( 2 ) ensuring that the beam remains close to the crest phase on each separate pass ( soon continuously and automatically ! ) , and ( 3 ) providing continuous fast correction of 60 cycle harmonic noise on the beam .",
    "we have developed beam diagnostic devices to continuously monitor and record beam conditions with 5 hz update rates using digitization of multiple video monitors .",

    "<S> this allows the energy spread from a cebaf - type machine to be relatively small ; the measured energy spread from cebaf at 4 gev is less than 100 parts per million accumulated over times of order several days . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the various subsystems contributing to the energy spread of a cebaf - type accelerator are reviewed , as well as the machine diagnostics and controls that are used in cebaf to ensure that a small energy spread is provided during routine running . </S>",
    "<S> examples of relevant developments are ( 1 ) stable short bunches emerging from the injector , ( 2 ) precision timing and phasing of the linacs with respect to the centroid of the beam bunches on all passes , ( 3 ) implementing 2 khz sampling rate feedback systems for final energy stabilization , and ( 4 ) continuous beam energy spread monitoring with optical transition radiation devices . </S>",
