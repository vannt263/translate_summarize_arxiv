    "since the mid sixties , the gravitational collapse of stars has been studied based on computer simulations @xcite . investigated topics in the collapse phase included general relativistic dynamics @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , deleptonization and neutrino trapping @xcite , progenitor rotation @xcite , dissociation energy @xcite , neutrino transport and thermalization @xcite , nuclear electron capture @xcite , and the emission of gravitational waves @xcite , to name only a few of the many possible references .",
    "later , the field has somewhat separated into two rather disjunct lines of research . on the one hand ,",
    "the increasing computing power was focused on the details of the neutrino physics and neutrino transport in spherical symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the computational resources were invested in multidimensional dynamics for the investigation of rotating progenitors @xcite , general relativity @xcite , and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "only few recent multidimensional collapse simulations made the effort to include neutrino physics .",
    "these schemes are either very computationally expensive @xcite or rely on simplifications of the neutrino transport and its microphysics @xcite .    among the neutrino physics that is most difficult to capture are accurate composition - dependent rates of electron captures on nuclei @xcite in the early and medium phase of collapse and the competition between neutrino diffusion and neutrino thermalization in the later phase of the collapse @xcite .",
    "electrons at high matter density are degenerate so that they are captured with large energies on bound or free protons .",
    "the produced high energy neutrinos first thermalize by electron scattering until their energy - dependent mean free path is large enough to make diffusion competitive . as the trapped neutrinos",
    "become degenerate themselves in the late stage of collapse , the ability to stream away at low energy actually becomes the bottleneck for further deleptonization .",
    "most recent simulations of this thermalization - diffusion process are based on an individual treatment of different neutrino energy bins with boltzmann neutrino transport @xcite .",
    "the neutrino physics enters the equations of hydrodynamics in the form of three different source terms : as an electron fraction change rate , as an energy or entropy source , and as a source of acceleration by neutrino stress .",
    "this paper aims to bridge the two lines of research by an efficient and very simple prescription of how published and future results of accurate neutrino transport simulations in spherical symmetry could be incorporated in the hydrodynamics of core collapse for a more realistic study of the multidimensional dynamics , the role of magnetic fields , and the emission of gravitational waves than with adiabatic simulations .",
    "a parameterization of the three source terms is individually described and evaluated in @xmath0[sec : electron.fraction]-[sec : velocity ] .",
    "additional tests of the robustness of the parameterization with respect to model changes or differences in the dynamics are conducted in @xmath0[sec : model.dependence ] .",
    "after the conclusion , more code - specific details of the implementation are defined in the appendix .",
    "stellar core collapse proceeds by an imbalance between the self - gravitating forces of the inner core and its fluid pressure .",
    "the baryons contribute the most significant part to the gravitational mass of the stellar core while the degenerate electron gas provides the dominant contribution to the pressure .",
    "the electron fraction , defined as the number of electrons per baryon in the gas , is therefore the most fundamental quantity for the stability of the inner core and the evolution of its size during the dynamical collapse .",
    "the electron fraction evolves by electron captures on nuclei and the emission of the produced electron neutrinos .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review of the nuclear input physics before and during core collapse .",
    "the collapse continues until the matter at the center reaches nuclear density .",
    "strong interactions reduce the compressibility at that point and the inner core bounces .",
    "the outgoing pressure wave turns into a shock wave as soon as it reaches the sonic point at the edge of the homologously collapsing inner core .",
    "the size of the inner core is important because it determines the location of this transition , the initial energy imparted to the shock , and the amount of matter outside of the shock that will be accreted and dissociated in the ongoing evolution .",
    "figure [ fig : ye.trajectories ] shows the electron fraction , @xmath1 , as a function of density , @xmath2 , at different times , @xmath3 .",
    "the data has been taken from a general relativistic core collapse simulation with boltzmann neutrino transport and `` standard '' input physics .",
    "the selected time slices correspond to the instances at which the central density reaches @xmath4 g/@xmath5 , @xmath6 g/@xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 g/@xmath5 , and finally @xmath9 at bounce .",
    "figure [ fig : ye.trajectories ] demonstrates that the function @xmath10 depends only weakly on time .",
    "hence , it could be interesting to investigate how hydrodynamics simulations behave when the computationally expensive calculation of @xmath10 is replaced by linear interpolation in the logarithmic density of a time - independent tabulated template of @xmath11 . because the electron fraction profile should be as accurate as possible at the time of bounce , when the final size of the inner core is determined , the choice @xmath12 at the time of bounce , @xmath13 , will be investigated .",
    "the data for the bounce electron fraction profile of model g15 are listed in machine - readable tables in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a fitting formula is provided here to increase the flexibility of the approach .",
    "the fitting of @xmath11 is based on a piecewise linear approximation with a piecewise cubic correction .",
    "the parameters are two points in the @xmath2-@xmath14 space , @xmath15 , and a scale , @xmath16 , of the correction . suggested values of the parameters",
    "are given in table [ tab : fit - formula ] .",

[ fig : fit - formula ] is very satisfactory .",
    "table [ tab : fit - formula ] shows that the fits for the two models only differ in the density at the base of the silicon - oxygen layer , @xmath18 , and in the central electron fraction , @xmath19 .",
    "the fit can thus easily be modified by variation of these two physical quantities .",
    "the implementation of an electron fraction evolution along @xmath11 in a pure hydrodynamics scheme is achieved by the simple prescription@xmath20 where the variation is taken at the same fluid element .",
    "the minimum function guarantees that the electron fraction monotonically decreases even if transient instances would occur where @xmath21 would be larger than the actual @xmath14 . at the very start of a simulation , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : ye.trajectories ] indicates that @xmath22 almost everywhere ( @xmath14 in the progenitor data is represented by the profile belonging to the central density @xmath23 g/@xmath5 ; @xmath21 is represented by the profile belonging to @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , the deleptonization described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyedt ] ) sets in smoothly after a short time of adiabatic compression during which the original electron fraction profile moves to the right in the @xmath2-@xmath14 space shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ye.trajectories ] to join the bounce profile , @xmath21 .",
    "the latter is then followed thereafter .",
    "figure [ fig : yevol.ps ] compares the resulting evolution of the electron fraction to the evolution obtained in the full model g15 with accurate neutrino transport .",
    "the small deviations between the two solutions are readily explained with the profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ye.trajectories ] : at low density , early time slices ( marked by triangles ) have a lower electron fraction than the bounce profile ( marked by a circle ) . at densities",
    "@xmath25 g/@xmath5 the realistic profile ( marked by a diamond ) assumes a larger electron fraction than the bounce profile .",
    "time slices that reach to even larger densities ( marked by a square and a cross ) show lower electron fractions than the bounce profile . because the bounce profile has been taken as template for the parameterization , the same differences are reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig : yevol.ps ] , most clearly visible in the profile at @xmath26 ms before bounce .",
    "the parameterized deleptonization leads to somewhat higher @xmath14 values in the outer layers , to lower @xmath14 values in intermediate regions , and to higher @xmath14 values near the center .",
    "the deviations are within @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath14 value in model g15 rises again around nuclear density because of the increasing neutron degeneracy . due to the minimum function , this change is not captured by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyedt ] ) so that the central @xmath14 value at bounce in the parameterized evolution eventually falls below the corresponding value in the g15 model .",
    "a parameterization of the lepton fraction instead of the electron fraction would improve this , because the @xmath14 would then assume its correct equilibrium value after neutrino trapping .",
    "also the entropy changes would more consistently derive from lepton fraction changes than from electron fraction changes .",
    "the decision to work with the electron fraction was motivated by the dominant role of @xmath14 in the determination of the chandrasekhar mass of the bouncing core , because @xmath14 is a common input variable of realistic equations of state , and because a numerical determination of weak equilibrium would be required to find @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "the @xmath14 profile of model g15 at @xmath26 ms after bounce shows the prominent electron fraction trough that arises when the accretion shock dissociates matter at neutrino - transparent densities around the enclosed mass @xmath28 m@xmath29 .",
    "the huge number of neutrinos emitted in the neutrino burst also leads to neutrino absorption ahead of the shock ( manifest in the @xmath14 peak at @xmath30 m@xmath29 in the time slice at @xmath26 ms after bounce ) .",
    "these @xmath14-changes can of course not be expected to be represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyedt ] ) based on the stationary bounce template .",
    "more sophisticated techniques are necessary to adequately implement the neutrino physics in the long - term postbounce phase .",
    "the electron captures during collapse are not only changing the electron fraction , the matter entropy is affected as well .",
    "the baryons are in nuclear statistical equilibrium and the electrons are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus , the increments of the entropy per baryon , @xmath31 , are determined by the values of the chemical potentials @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 of neutrons , protons , and electrons , respectively .",
    "additionally , there is an energy transfer between matter and neutrinos , @xmath35 ( e.g. @xcite and references therein),@xmath36 the temperature of the fluid is denoted by @xmath37 . depending on the density of the material and the energy of the produced neutrinos , the neutrino can either ( i ) directly escape , ( ii )",
    "thermalize and escape , or ( iii ) be trapped for longer than the dynamical time scale .    in regime ( i ) , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is",
    "the average energy of the freely escaping neutrinos @xcite , thus @xmath40 in this regime , electron capture on nuclei dominates over electron capture on protons . due to the average q - value of the nuclei @xmath41 mev @xcite the neutrinos",
    "are produced with an average energy that is only marginally larger than @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding small entropy decrease in this regime shall be neglected in the following parameterization .    in regime ( ii )",
    "the produced neutrinos start to be trapped by coherent scattering off heavy nuclei .",
    "the increasing matter density causes the electron chemical potential to rise so that the neutrinos are produced with higher initial energies . as the neutrino mean free path is proportional to @xmath43 , the fastest way of escape proceeds through thermalization at the high end of the neutrino energy spectrum with a transition to diffusion and escape at its low end .",
    "figure 7 in @xcite illustrates this thermalization process , which ends with a final escape energy of order @xmath44 mev . for the following parameterization of the entropy changes",
    ", @xmath45 is used as a constant parameter that defines where regime ( ii ) commences , namely when @xmath46 .",
    "the entropy increase is then evaluated according to@xmath47 where @xmath48 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyedt ] ) .    at even higher densities , in regime ( iii ) , the neutrinos are not able to escape before bounce .",
    "they are in equilibrium with the fluid so that @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy.general ] ) is determined by the neutrino chemical potential , @xmath49 . the neutrinos form a normal gas component without transport abilities and the entropy is conserved in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy.general ] ) and the equilibrium condition @xmath50 as second parameter , a density threshold @xmath51 g/@xmath5 is introduced to define the beginning of regime ( iii ) beyond which no further entropy changes are taken into account .",
    "figure [ fig : sevol.ps ] presents the entropy evolution based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsdt ] ) in comparison to the entropy profiles of model g15 with comprehensive neutrino transport .",
    "the two parameters used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsdt ] ) enable nice agreement in the collapse phase ( profiles at @xmath52 ms and @xmath26 ms before bounce ) .",
    "the density at which the entropy starts to rise is mainly controlled by @xmath53 mev .",
    "the level of the central entropy is mainly determined by the choice of @xmath54 g/@xmath5 .",
    "the values of the two parameters have not been particularly fine - tuned because they should rather represent a generic estimate than a multi - digit optimum for one particular model .",
    "the @xmath55 lower entropy in the parameterized evolution has no noticeable consequences for the dynamics of the cold matter in the inner core .",
    "the entropy profiles at @xmath26 ms after bounce show the expected differences at late time due to the omission of the neutrino burst in the parameterization .",
    "the postshock region in the realistic g15 calculation is significantly cooler because of the energy loss inferred by the neutrino emission .",
    "the adjacent region ahead of the accretion shock is somewhat hotter in model g15 due to neutrino absorptions .",
    "neutrino stress is the third important quantity at the interface between neutrino transport and hydrodynamics .",
    "although the neutrino pressure only contributes a fraction to the gas pressure , it influences the size of the inner core when the gas pressure and the gravitational forces cancel to a large extent . in regime ( iii ) , i.e. the optically thick region where transport processes can be neglected , the neutrino stress is determined by the gradient of the neutrino pressure @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the lagrangean time derivative of the velocity .",
    "the term in the middle is the general expression ; the term on the right hand side is its spherically symmetric limit based on an enclosed mass @xmath58 at radius @xmath59 .",

    "the constants @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 refer to the planck constant , the speed of light , and the boltzmann constant , respectively .",
    "@xmath66 is the fermi - dirac function of order n @xcite .",
    "for an implementation of neutrino stress in the optically thin regime , an estimate of the neutrino number luminosity is needed .",
    "it can be derived from the deleptonization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyedt ] ) and the requirement of lepton conservation .",
    "the simplest possible approximation in the construction of the neutrino flux from distributed sources is that the neutrinos leave isotropically and without time delay from the locations of deleptonization .",
    "even if this assumption is obviously wrong in core collapse , it leads to a useful first approximation of the non - local flux geometry @xcite .",
    "firstly , the deleptonization scheme in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyedt ] ) already suppresses sources at high opacities .",
    "secondly , lepton conservation requires that an isotropic source contributes with the square of its inverse distance so that closeby sources from this side of the neutrinosphere influence the direction of the neutrino flux more strongly than remote sources from the opposite side . with this assumption",
    ", the neutrino number flux can be expressed by the gradient of a scalar field , @xmath67 , which fulfills the poisson equation@xmath68 in spherical symmetry , the neutrino number luminosity based on eq .",

    "let us stay in the spherically symmetric limit to derive an extension of the neutrino pressure to the optically thin regions .",
    "the neutrino stress can be expressed as a convolution of the neutrino number luminosity , the neutrino energy , and the energy - dependent reaction cross sections @xcite .",

    "let s now assume that the spectrum of the number luminosity is well approximated by a fermi - dirac function with degeneracy parameter @xmath77 .",
    "the number luminosity can then be expressed as @xmath78 for the following rough estimate of the decline of the neutrino stress in the outer layers , it is further assumed that the mean free path scales as @xmath79 , so that the energy integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : acceleration.by.stress ] ) can be evaluated and expressed by the number luminosity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : luminosity]),@xmath80 the neutrino temperature , @xmath81 , and the degeneracy parameter , @xmath77 , can not easily be derived as a function of radius without solving a more detailed transport problem .",
    "though , at high opacity , they limit to the matter temperature , @xmath82 , and the neutrino degeneracy , @xmath83 , respectively .    the neutrino stress for the hydrodynamics simulation is now generated by the following procedure : an estimate for the number luminosity is given by eq . ( [ eq : luminosity.estimate ] ) .",
    "then , at all densities larger than a specified neutrino trapping density @xmath84 , the neutrino stress is evaluated according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : acceleration.by.pressure ] ) and ( [ eq : neutrino.pressure ] ) . with the neutrino stress at density @xmath84",

    "there , it is assumed that the neutrino spectrum is well represented based on a degeneracy @xmath91 .",
    "it is then consistent with @xmath0[sec : entropy ] and the assumption of spherical symmetry if i express the neutrino temperature by the average neutrino energy parameter , @xmath45 , and set @xmath92 .",
    "the simplest continuous transition of the neutrino stress from regime ( iii ) to regime ( i ) is realized by the adoption of the larger of the two limiting cases in each intermediate point .",

    "( [ eq : luminosity.estimate ] ) represent the local values at the point where @xmath95 is evaluated .",
    "suggestions with respect to the implementation of this spherically symmetric neutrino stress in a multidimensional hydrodynamics code and convenient approximations for the evaluation of the fermi integrals are collected in the appendix .",
    "this procedure circumvents any explicit reference to cross sections and is therefore simple to apply .",
    "of course , the cross sections do enter the constant @xmath85 implicitly via the relation between the neutrino pressure gradient and the number luminosity at the transition density @xmath84 .",
    "as the value of the number luminosity is derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyedt ] ) , it reflects the deleptonization rate in the reference calculation with full transport which is based on information about the opacities used in the run that produced the electron fraction template at bounce time .",
    "figure ( [ fig : vevol.ps ] ) shows a summary of the evolution of velocity profiles .",
    "it demonstrates that the collapse dynamics is accurately reproduced with the parameterized neutrino physics .",
    "some differences can still be made out : as discussed in @xmath0[sec : electron.fraction ] , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyedt ] ) implies a transient halt in the deleptonization until the density has increased enough that the initial @xmath14 profile ( labeled by @xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ye.trajectories ] ) catches up with the template ( labeled by @xmath24 ) .",
    "this leads to a small delay in the infall of the outer layers with respect to the reference g15 model .",
    "this is visible in the velocity profiles at the enclosed mass of @xmath96 - @xmath97 m@xmath29 .    the time slice at @xmath26 ms before bounce shows a soft outgoing pressure wave in the solution with the parameterized neutrino physics that is not present in the reference model .",
    "the first suspicion was that it is related to the treatment of the neutrino stress because its appearance coincides to some extent with the moment when the density @xmath84 is reached at the center , i.e. the moment when the applied neutrino stress jumps from zero to the value described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dvdt.tail ] ) . however , a more careful investigation showed that the dominant reason is the shallower electron fraction profile close to the center in the @xmath98 ms time slice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : yevol.ps ] ) .",
    "the outgoing wave is caused by a combination of the excess electron pressure at the center with the electron pressure deficit around an enclosed mass of @xmath99 m@xmath29 .",
    "it introduces visible perturbations in the vicinity of the position of shock formation in the time slice at @xmath100 ms before bounce .",
    "nevertheless , the much stronger outgoing pressure wave from bounce and its steepening to the bounce - shock are nicely reproduced in the @xmath101 ms and @xmath102 ms time slices .",
    "the significant differences induced by the neutrino burst in the electron fraction and entropy profiles at @xmath26 ms after bounce seem to have surprisingly little influence on the early dynamics .",
    "the velocity profiles as functions of enclosed mass still agree at @xmath26 ms after bounce .",
    "the differences in the state of the postshock matter rather affect the shock radius than the shock mass .",
    "while the s@xmath103hock in the g15 model is positioned at a radius of @xmath104 km , it already has reached @xmath105 km in the parameterized run due to the omission of the lepton and energy loss by the neutrino burst .",
    "after the demonstration that this simple parameterization works well for the one model g15 , this section aims to explore to what extent the approximations are robust against variations in the dynamics or the initial conditions .",
    "a first test is the application of the same parameterization with the same parameters for @xmath45 and @xmath84 to a different stellar model .",
    "the g15 model discussed above is launched from the @xcite model s15s7b2 .",
    "it has a quite typical iron core @xmath106 m@xmath29 .",
    "the run n13 in @xcite is based on the progenitor of @xcite with an especially small iron core @xmath107 m@xmath108    figure [ fig : model.ps ] compares different runs at the time of core - bounce .",
    "figure [ fig : model.ps]a shows the bounce profile @xmath109 of the n13 run that was used to specify the deleptonization according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyedt ] ) for the parameterized run a13 .",
    "the bounce profiles of the n13 and a13 runs are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : model.ps]b - d .",
    "the quality of the approximation is very similar to the one discussed above for the g15 model . the same choice of the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath84 seems to fit also other stellar models .",
    "the dynamics in the n13 and g15 models is also different .",
    "the former has been calculated with newtonian hydrodynamics and @xmath110 neutrino transport , the latter with general relativistic dynamics and transport . as a second test",
    "i investigate how the parameterized solution reacts if the bounce template for a newtonian simulation is taken from a general relativistic model of the same progenitor model .",
    "thus , a bounce - template g13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : model.ps]a has been produced from a general relativistic calculation with neutrino transport . a repetition of run a13 with the exchanged template , @xmath111 instead of @xmath109 , leads to the results labeled by x13 g in fig .",
    "[ fig : model.ps]b - d . in spite of the significant dynamical differences in the runs that produced the templates n13 ( solid line ) and g13 ( dashed line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : model.ps]a , the differences in velocity , electron fraction , and entropy profiles between runs a13 and x13 g are barely visible .",
    "this means that the template for the parameterization of the microphysics can be extracted from a run whose dynamics differs from the run in which the parameterization will be applied .    a third test has been performed by the exchange of bounce templates between the progenitor models .",
    "first , a new template has been created with a newtonian simulation of the s15s7b2 progenitor model labeled by n15 in fig .",
    "[ fig : model.ps ] .",
    "the parameterized newtonian run x13p has then been launched from the @xmath112 m@xmath29 progenitor model using this @xmath113 template .",
    "figure [ fig : model.ps]b - d shows a small deviation @xmath114 in the location of the shock formation . although a given template from one progenitor still seems to be useful for many dynamical investigations that are launched from different progenitor models , it might be recommended to use a template that is derived from the same progenitor to achieve the best accuracy .",
    "a closer inspection of the differences reveals the well - known fact that the final deleptonization in the inner core is essential for the location of the shock formation . because the parameterization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyedt ] ) does not support electron fraction increases , it is the minimum @xmath14 that counts .",
    "the minimum @xmath14 in the templates of the n13 and g13 models in fig .",
    "[ fig : model.ps]a coincide , while @xmath14 in the n15 run reached slightly lower values .",
    "the described parameterization has been designed to provide a very efficient and reasonably accurate way to lead a hydrodynamics simulation from the onset of collapse of the supernova progenitor star to bounce .",
    "it has also been shown to be accurate for the initial rebound of the stellar core .",
    "however , the simplicity of the described approach entails several limitations .",
    "the signal of gravitational waves is not likely to be limited to the short time interval around bounce that has traditionally been investigated ( @xcite and references therein ) . in",
    "delayed , and especially in neutrino - driven explosions , the signal may decay after the first peak around bounce only to regain strength on a longer time scale of several hundreds of milliseconds , when fluid instabilities in the hot shocked matter between the protoneutron star and the shock front grow to asymmetries on larger scales @xcite .",
    "the dynamics and the input physics for the description of the cold matter in the collapse phase are fundamentally different from the physics in the hydrostatic , but turbulent , hot mantle of the protoneutron star , which eventually determines the supernova explosion after core - bounce . the suggested scheme has not been designed for the postbounce phase and does not describe any of the weak interaction physics relevant after bounce .",
    "firstly , the scheme handles only deleptonization and not neutrino transport .",
    "no attempt has been made to describe the very delicate neutrino _ energy _",
    "deposition behind the stalled accretion shock .",
    "neutrino heating at @xmath115 ms after bounce and beyond is thought to drive important fluid instabilities .",
    "secondly , the scheme is only applicable to situations where the deleptonization is caused by compression of cold matter .",
    "even if the deleptonization in the condensing accreting material continues to be captured after bounce , major contributions from the emission of the neutrino burst at @xmath26 ms after bounce and from neutrino diffusion in the dense core are missed by the simple parameterization .",
    "therefore , if one extends an otherwise adiabatic code with the suggested parameterization for a simulation of the _ postbounce _ phase , one obtains the benefit that simulations pass through a significantly more realistic configuration at bounce and that overly fast prompt explosions for small progenitors are avoided . but no improvement is obtained toward an adequate description of the important neutrino physics in the postbounce phase .    another question is the reliability of the scheme in the collapse phase when fast rotation rates are applied .",
    "the density distribution is then significantly less spherically symmetric .",
    "i think one can be somewhat optimistic because the parameterization of the deleptonization during collapse in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dyedt ] ) and ( [ eq : dsdt ] ) relies more on the local density evolution than on the global geometry .",
    "this is supported by the low sensitivity of the parameterization to global dynamical changes investigated in @xmath116[sec : model.dependence ] .",
    "a global asymmetry changes rather the spatial distribution of local conditions than the quality of the local conditions themselves .",
    "relevant local conditions are : the time scale of compression , the density gradient , or the curvature of the isodensity surface at the point of investigation ( as a measure of the deleptonizing volume per surface area ) .",
    "these quantities as function of the density may change by several percent with respect to a spherically symmetric scenario , but probabely not by orders of magnitude .",
    "if this speculation is true , the parameterization would still be approximately applicable .",

    "the spherically symmetric implementation of the neutrino stress , as layed out in the appendix , is very simple and physically well - defined , but fails to represent any asymmetries in the shape or temperature of the neutrinospheres and in the emitted neutrino luminosities .",
    "this might still be an acceptable limitation because the influence of the neutrino stress ( momentum deposition ) on the collapse dynamics is not as crucial as the much discussed neutrino heating ( energy deposition ) later in the postbounce phase . in the postbounce phase , which is not in the scope of this parameterization , asymmetries in the neutrino field",
    "can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the shock revival @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "stellar evolution models point to rather slowly rotating inner cores @xcite and corresponding collapse simulations with multidimensional neutrino transport have not shown evidence for sizable asymmetries in the neutrino field @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of core collapse is dominated by electron pressure .",
    "dynamical simulations are only realistic if they can take account of electron captures on bound or free protons during infall . at increasing densities",
    "the electron captures get inhibited by neutrino phase space blocking so that the ability to thermalize and emit the produced neutrinos significantly contributes to the determination of the final electron fraction in the inner core .",
    "the lower the electron fraction , the smaller is the mass of the core that bounces when nuclear densities are reached and the smaller is also the initial energy imparted to the outgoing shock .",
    "these well - known relationships ask for a careful inclusion of neutrino physics in simulations of stellar core collapse .",
    "the most accurate treatment of neutrino transport has been developed in spherical symmetry @xcite where it has been coupled to the most recent evaluation of electron capture rates on heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the previous sections present an embarassingly simple and computationally efficient parameterization of the deleptonization in the collapse phase so that the consequences of past and future improvements of the neutrino physics should be straightforward to incorporate in multidimensional simulations that focus on other aspects of core collapse .",
    "the scheme is based on electron fraction profiles as function of density at bounce , @xmath11 , that have been produced by spherically symmetric simulations with full neutrino transport .",
    "a fitting formula is provided to conveniently represent these electron fraction profiles and to allow for adjustments to future developments .",
    "it is found that the time - evolution of the electron fraction in the simulations , @xmath10 , follows in reasonable approximation the profile @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding parameterization brings the electron fraction at bounce , when it is most important for the shock dynamics , very close to the value in the original simulation .",
    "unfortunately , it is not exactly equal because small differences in the time - dependence of the deleptonization will lead to density differences at bounce so that @xmath11 is not evaluated at exactly the same position as in the original simulation .    once the deleptonization is given , the entropy changes and neutrino stress are estimated based on two additional parameters , an average neutrino escape energy , @xmath53 mev , and a neutrino trapping density , @xmath54 g/@xmath5 .",
    "these parameters have not been fine - tuned , but may require adaption if the weak interaction physics is changed .    in a comparison of",
    "the parameterized runs with the original ones it is found that the dynamics of core collapse is quite accurately reproduced .",
    "the parameterized neutrino physics presents a significant improvement with respect to adiabatic treatments .",
    "its accuracy may even rival with neutrino transport approximations that neglect neutrino - electron scattering .",
    "however , some clearly visible inaccuracies do develop .",
    "the deleptonization of central zones at high densities proceeds slower than in the reference simulation .",
    "this leads to a weak outgoing pressure wave before bounce - density is reached .",
    "it propagates to the point of shock formation where it causes moderate perturbations .",
    "inaccuracies due to a deviation in the timing of the deleptonization are also found in the hydrodynamic structure ahead of the shock .",
    "these deviations are a direct consequence of the differences between the function @xmath11 and the time evolution of the electron fraction in the reference simulation .",
    "the evolution of the electron fraction and entropy is based on the local thermodynamic state of the fluid .",
    "this should allow an application also in models where the dynamics moderately differs from the spherically symmetric case with which the electron fraction template has been produced .",
    "the less important neutrino stress has been approximated in a spherically averaged manner .",
    "an extension to handle asymmetries in the neutrino stress has been sketched , but its accuracy in models with essentially aspherical density distributions remains to be investigated .",
    "the sensitivity of the parameterized runs to changes in the model has been tested in two experiments that are accessible with comprehensive neutrino transport : firstly , a template produced with general relativistic dynamics has been used in a parameterized run with newtonian gravity and , secondly , a template produced with a 15 @xmath118 progenitor star has been used in a parameterized run launched from a 13 @xmath118 progenitor star with a very different structure of the iron core .",
    "it was found that the parameterization is not sensitive to the dynamical differences between general relativistic and newtonian gravity .",
    "the choice of the progenitor for the template , however , has a small influence on the parameterization .",
    "the extent of the deviation is directly determined by the difference between the central @xmath14 values in the templates . in the investigated case , the @xmath14 difference translates to @xmath114 difference in the point of shock formation .",
    "i thus believe that one and the same template can be used with different progenitors for qualitative studies of the dynamics . but a progenitor - specific template is recommended for more quantitative investigations .    the parameterization has been designed for the collapse phase and not for the postbounce evolution .",
    "it does not contain any physics related to neutrino heating . during collapse , it relies on the weak interaction physics used for the production of the bounce template .",
    "the nuclear and weak interaction physics during collapse is an interesting field of research .",
    "progress in its adoption in spherically symmetric simulations has been made @xcite and is likely to continue .",
    "hopefully , this paper enables the efficient transfer of results from state - of - the - art neutrino transport simulations in spherical symmetry to simulations with more spatial degrees of freedom , where the implementation of comprehensive weak interaction physics together with the accurate solution of the energy - dependent multidimensional boltzmann equation is yet computationally prohibitive .",
