    ". these two cases may show similar overall spectra , but ionic emission lines are also expected for the shocked cs dust .",
    "low resolution spectroscopy will be possible with spica , which will be useful to distinguish the shocked cs dust emission from is dust echo .",
    "ir emission by sn dust has a smaller contribution to the ir luminosity .",
    "however , thanks to the lower temperature than the shocked cs dust and is dust echo , the expected spectrum has a peak at longer wavelengths . the contamination by the shocked cs dust may be small if @xmath160 .",
    "in addition , the emission from the is dust echo can also be small if a typical interstellar density is less than @xmath161 @xcite . if the contributions from these two components are small , the detection of sn dust is limited only by the confusion limit of background galaxies , which is an order of 0.1 mjy at 50 @xmath20 m  with a 3 m telescope .",
    "the great advantage to detect the sn dust at the transitional phase is the low optical depth .",
    "if a sn forms 0.1 @xmath153 of dust , the optical depth becomes @xmath162 for the mass absorption coefficient of dust @xmath163 , we take the value for astronomical silicate at 24 @xmath20 m  @xcite . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "the coefficient is lower ( @xmath164 ) . at early epochs ,",
    "such a large mass of dust is optically thick even at ir wavelengths . on the contrary , at the transitional phase , the optical depth can be smaller than unity , which enables a reliable estimate of the total dust mass .",
    "another advantage is the small confusion with the is dust swept up by the sn ejecta .",
    "the mass of the is dust ( @xmath165 ) can be approximately written as follows by neglecting the destruction ; @xmath166 the mass of swept - up is dust is nearly @xmath167 in snrs at @xmath168 yr , which makes it difficult to estimate the sn dust mass in snrs . on the contrary ,",
    "the swept - up is dust mass at the transitional phase is only an order of @xmath169 .    in summary , future observations of sne at the transitional phase will the gap of infrared observations of sne with the age of @xmath5 years .",
    "at @xmath159 @xmath20 m , observations will provide an interesting way to study the circumstellar and interstellar environments of the progenitor .",
    "with spica , these components can also be studied by low resolution spectroscopy .",
    "if these two components are relatively weak , the sn dust might be detected at longer wavelengths , which enables the reliable measurement of the dust mass .",

    "observations at the transitional phase from sn to snr have not been extensively performed , especially at ir wavelengths .",
