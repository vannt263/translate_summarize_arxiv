    "game theory has experienced a great development since early time of last century through its wide application in nearly every aspect of our modern society . in recent few years , along with the thriving of quantum information , a newly - emerging field , quantum game has begun to attract much attention due to the intimate connection between the theory of game and the theory of quantum communication @xcite .",
    "this field was initiated by a paper of meyer , finding that a player can always beats his classical opponent by adopting quantum strategies on the coin tossing game @xcite .",
    "later , eisert _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced quantum entanglement into the famous prisoners dilemma , by which the contradiction existing in the classical scenario vanishes . since then",
    ", quantum game theory has developed rapidly and exhibited great superiority over its classical counterpart in later works @xcite .",
    "in addition to theoretical investigations , du _",
    "realized the quantum prisoners dilemma in experiments for the first time @xcite , and therefore constructed a practical base for quantum game .    however , most of previous investigations on quantum game mainly focused on game models with discrete strategies set . in li _",
    "_ s paper @xcite , they first put forward a quantization scheme for cournot duopoly , a famous economical model even preceding the birth of game theory @xcite , in which two players can virtually cooperate and get the optimal profit at the maximal quantum entanglement between them albeit both act `` selfishly '' just as they do in the classical case .",
    "this work actually set up a foundation for further discussions regarding quantum game with continuous strategies @xcite .",
    "recently qin _ et al . _",
    "introduced a quantization scheme for asymmetric games @xcite .",
    "the key modification of their scheme compared with li _",
    "s is the adoption of two different entanglement factors , which ensure the asymmetric games to get the optimal cooperative profit .",
    "nevertheless , qin _",
    "s quantum scheme can still be regarded as a fair play , for the two factors are determined by the extent of the asymmetry of the game .",
    "it is quite often that various environments may affect the quantum game , leading to asymmetric forms of the entanglement operator .    hence , to better understand the property of quantum game , it s worthwhile studying the distinctive features of quantum game resulted from the change of the entanglement operator . in this letter",
    "we develop the quantum model of cournot s duopoly proposed by li _",
    "by changing the initial state before actually entangling them , and we define these operations altogether as a whole entangling operation .",
    "thus it can be discovered that the total profit at the unique nash equilibrium will increase monotonously as long as the entropy of the entangled state , namely the entanglement , tends to infinity .",
    "while , considering the lack of symmetry in this quantization scheme , our result will not remain pareto optimal ( the best result that can be achieved without disadvantaging at least one group ) , which in fact may not be a necessity in the real world because of the simple fact that there is no absolutely - impartial law . besides , all of the operators we cite in the quantization of cournot duopoly can be realized experimentally within the capacity of modern optical technology through proper design .",
    "now we briefly recall the classical cournot duopoly .",
    "duopoly is an economic condition in which two firms hold the market of a certain commodity without a third competitor . in cournot model ,",
    "two firms are assumed to produce a homogeneous product and simultaneously decide their quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 . and the price of this product is decided by the quantities as    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the total quantity of two firms , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "assume that the unit cost of the product is also a constant @xmath6 , the profit function of each firm would be :    @xmath7    with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it s easy to work out the unique nash equilibrium :    @xmath10    however , the nash equilibrium is not the optimal solution for the market . if the two firms cooperate and raise their total quantity to @xmath11 , they can acquire _ the highest total profit _ @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , by keeping the symmetry of the model , we can obtain the pareto optimal in the following solution :    @xmath13    the profit difference between the optimal choice and the nash equilibrium reflects the conflict between individual rationality and collective rationality , just like in the classical prisoners dilemma .",
    "here we put forward a modified quantization model of li _ et al . _",
    "s @xcite , where we make use of two single - mode electromagnetic fields .",
    "[ structure ] shows the quantum structure of the game . as a extension ,",
    "we first apply two single - mode squeezing operator @xmath14 to the vacuum state , where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the creation and annihilation operator of the corresponding field , followed by a two - mode squeezing operator @xmath17 of a two - mode electromagnetic field .",
    "thus the total entanglement operator would be :    @xmath18 \\notag \\\\ & \\cdot \\exp [ \\gamma _ { 1}(a_{1}{}^{2}-a_{1}^{\\dag } { } ^{2})/2 ] \\notag \\\\ & \\cdot \\exp [ \\gamma _ { 2}(a_{2}{}^{2}-a_{2}^{\\dag } { } ^{2})/2],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with constraint @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( which also is an extension of li _ et al _ s model ) .",
    "apparently , we can turn back to li _",
    "et al _ s entanglement operator if @xmath21 . the strategies in the set of local unitary operators is @xmath22 $ ] as the scheme of li _ et al .",
    "the final measurement is made corresponding to the observables @xmath23 , which in quantum optics is the amplitude quadrature ( we can simply perceive it as the `` position '' operator ) .",
    "this measurement is done by the homodyne measurement assuming that the state is infinitely squeezed .",
    "correspondingly , by citing the phase quadrature @xmath24 ( which can be seen as the `` momentum '' operator ) , we can rewrite the entanglement operator and the strategies in the following form :    @xmath25   \\notag \\\\ & \\quad \\,\\cdot \\exp [ i\\gamma _ { 1}(\\hat{x}_{1}\\hat{p}_{1}+\\hat{p}_{1}\\hat{x}% _ { 1})/2 ]   \\notag \\\\ & \\quad \\,\\cdot \\exp [ i\\gamma _ { 2}(\\hat{x}_{2}\\hat{p}_{2}+\\hat{p}_{2}\\hat{x}% _ { 2})/2 ] , \\\\ \\hat{d}_{j}(x_{j } ) & = \\exp ( -ix_{j}\\hat{p}_{j}),\\qquad j=1,2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    obviously , the classical cournot duopoly is only a special case with @xmath26 in its quantum extension .",
    "because the strategy set is not extended compared to its classical counterpart , we can be sure that all the features shown in the quantization version attribute to the entanglement of the states . _ the specific property of the entangled state is analyzed in the paragraphs below . _",
    "by detailed calculation we get :    @xmath27 , \\\\",
    "\\hat{j}^{\\dag } \\hat{d}_{2}(x_{2})\\hat{j } & = \\exp [ -ix_{2}(\\hat{p } _ { 2}e^{\\gamma _ { 2}}\\cosh \\gamma _ { 12}+\\hat{p}_{1}e^{\\gamma _ { 1}}\\sinh \\gamma _ { 12})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore the final state reads :    @xmath28\\left\\vert vac\\right\\rangle _ { 1 }   \\notag \\\\ & \\otimes \\exp [ -ie^{\\gamma _ { 2}}(x_{2}\\cosh \\gamma _ { 12}+x_{1}\\sinh \\gamma _ { 12})\\hat{p}_{2}]\\left\\vert vac\\right\\rangle _ { 2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the measurement gives the respective quantity of each firm player :    @xmath29    simply by substituting the above into the classical profit functions ( see eq .",
    "( cl - profit ) ) , we get the quantum profit :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 $ ] .    solving the nash equilibrium equations we obtain the unique solution :",
    "@xmath32    and the profit at the equilibrium reads :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 .",
    "apparently , the profit functions only depend on two parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , if we make @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 , it s easy to find that the result is exactly that of li _ et al _ in their quantization scheme .",
    "using the method put forward in rendell s paper @xcite , we write the entangled state in the representation of `` position '' :    @xmath39.\\ ] ]    by solving the equations below :    @xmath40    we can obtain the expression of the three unknown parameters as    @xmath41    where @xmath42 . to better assess the entanglement of the state",
    ", we need to calculate the von neumann entropy of the state , which is defined as @xmath43tr@xmath44tr@xmath45 ( @xmath46 are the density matrix of two single - mode electromagnetic fields ) . based on the above calculation we get the following equality by making use of rendell s method :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 . as a confirmation , when @xmath37 , eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) is reduced to :    @xmath49    which is exactly the entropy of a two - mode squeezing state .",
    "it is interesting to find that like the profit function , the entropy is also determined by only two parameters @xmath35 and @xmath50 . in addition , we find that the von neumann entropy monotonously increases from zero to infinity as the parameter @xmath51 increases . since @xmath51 increases as either of the two parameters increases ( when @xmath52 ) , the entropy is an increasing function of both @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    in li _",
    "et al . _ s entanglement operator , through _ whole unitary transformation _ @xmath53 $ ] , we get the maximal entangled state as @xmath35 tends to infinity . nevertheless , it s discovered that only by changing the initial state via _ local unitary transformation _",
    "$ ] , the maximized entanglement is also achieved as long as entanglement exists ( i.e. @xmath52 , even if it is very small ; see fig .",
    "[ r12-fixed ] ) .",
    "obviously , such kind of situation is impossible in quantum game with hilbert space of finite dimensions .",
    "moreover , we estimate the asymmetry by calculating the relative difference of the `` position '' uncertainties ( which actually represent the width of gaussian wave package in each `` position '' space ) between two parties in the expression below :    @xmath55    for fixed and finite @xmath35 , the above expression would monotonously decreases as @xmath36 increases . due to the obvious fact that the system is completely symmetric when @xmath38 , we can simply perceive @xmath56 as a measurement of the asymmetry of the entangled state , while it s worth mentioning that all the discussion concerning asymmetry above only reflects a variation trend between variables and the final state .",
    "so far , we have confined three parameters presented in the entanglement operator to only two ones , i.e. @xmath57 . in the paragraphs below ,",
    "specific analysis of the relation between the game model adopted here and the entangled state is given .",
    "since the total profit of two players can not achieve the maximum at the nash equilibrium due to the deviation between individual rational choice and collective optimization requirement in classical cournot duopoly , it must be the application of quantum entanglement that eliminates this dilemma in li _",
    "et al . _ s scheme . as an extension of their entangled state",
    ", we separately give the alternation trends of the total profit ( @xmath58 ) and the entropy @xmath59 versus @xmath60 in the following figures ( fig .",
    "[ dr - fixed ] , fig .",
    "[ r12-fixed ] ) , in which the unit of profit is taken as @xmath12 , namely , the optimal value of the total profit in the classical cooperation scenario ( see eq .",
    "( [ cl - co - result ] ) ) .",
    "it s obvious to see that both the profit and entropy function increases as either of the parameters increases ( the condition @xmath52 is necessary here ; otherwise there would be no entanglement between two parties ) .",
    "when the entropy tends to infinity , the total profit also achieves its maximal value , and li _ et al .",
    "_ s situation is just a special case when @xmath38 .",
    "since the entropy is defined as a measurement of the entanglement of the state , it would be adequate to explain that the entanglement of the state does help improve the total profit in cournot duopoly independent of the concrete form of the state ( i.e. no matter in which way the entanglement is increasing ) as illustrated in the previous section , and so long as _ the maximal entanglement _",
    "is attained , the conflict between individual rationality and collective rationality disappears .    in fig .",
    "[ s - u ] , we present a more detailed function plot between the entropy and the total profit . apparently , although both quantities have the same increasing trend as seen in fig .",
    "[ dr - fixed ] and fig .",
    "[ r12-fixed ] , the entropy does not determine the total profit uniquely , i.e. there is nt a one - to - one correspondence between such two quantities .",
    "in combination of previous discussion concerning asymmetry , it is not difficult to find that _ the increase of asymmetry _ would cause the reducing of the total profit if the entanglement of the state do nt reach the maximum .",
    "furthermore , the variation of asymmetry also results in the change of the profit difference between two players in our quantization scheme .",
    "[ effect - of - dr ] shows that player 1 would monopolize the market and get the optimal profit when @xmath61 tends to positive infinity , while on the contrary , player 2 would become the monopolizer of the market if @xmath50 tends to negative infinity .",
    "therefore , @xmath62 can be separately regarded as the extent to which player 1 and 2 are encouraged ( or the corresponding opponents are suppressed ) , that is , the larger the parameter is , the more profit the corresponding player can acquire .",
    "we investigate the quantization of games with continuum strategic space by making use of a more general entanglement operator . for the particular case of symmetric scenario",
    ", it would turn back to the quantization scheme put forward by li _",
    "et al._. as an extension of their quantum model , we investigate _ the relation between the nash equilibrium in quantum situation and the entanglement of the state _ more specifically , and find that the optimal total profit can always be attained as long as the maximal entanglement is realized .",
    "also we observed some novel features such as the encouraging and suppressing effect in our quantum model , which completely attributes to _ the asymmetry of the system_. therefore , in our quantization scheme , the government would have more choices in managing the market .",
    "it actually constitutes a better base for further discussion of game models involving incomplete information or unequal competition status .",
