    "the scaling approach to kinetic roughening of surfaces has been found to be very useful in a large number of systems [ 1 - 7 ] .",
    "it is based on their self - affine property , reflected by the power - law dependence of the roughness on the system size in the , steady state , large - time regime . in the early regime",
    ", the roughness also increases as a power law of the time .",
    "systems in which such a behavior of the surface roughness was observed and analyzed include different ( vapor , electrochemical , epitaxial , etc . ) deposition processes , burning front , malignant tumors , and others .",
    "similarly , self - affine rough surfaces are formed in opposite processes of recession , desorption , dissolution , etc .",
    "very recently we have addressed the scaling behavior of cyclical processes in which two different processes ( typically one growth and one recession ) follow each other regularly .",
    "such cyclical processes are abundant in natural and artificial systems .",
    "many natural growth processes are affected by changing degree of illuminations through the daily cycle or seasonal variations in weather conditions .",
    "rechargeable batteries , charged and discharged periodically , provide an example of a practical application in which a rough metal surface accumulates on one of the electrode ( and cause a short when it reaches the other electrode ) . chemotherapeutic ( or radiation ) treatment of a malignant tumor applied periodically and the expansion / curtailment of a bacterial colony depending on the availability of the nutrient , may provide examples in the biosciences .",
    "experiments on the roughness of silver surface grown by cyclical electrodeposition / dissolution were found to be consistent with the scaling predictions .",
    "the main results of our theoretical investigations are summarized in sec .",
    "while studying these cyclical processes it was also realized that many of them are not exactly periodic .",
    "namely the duration of one ( or both ) primary process , may not be uniform .",
    "for example , the charge and discharge time of a battery maybe very irregular depending on the way it is utilized .",
    "if a growth process depends on atmospheric conditions such as alternating rain and sunshine , the length of the application time of each primary process will also fluctuate drastically",
    ". that may be the case for alternating dry / wet erosion processes of a natural rock bed or a man - built wall .",
    "so two crucial questions which ought to be addressed are : to what extent the cyclical theory applies to systems with non - uniform application times of the primary processes ? and",
    "if the cyclical theory fails to describe them , how are their scaling properties modified ?",
    "the goal of the present work is to seek and provide the answers to these two essential questions .",
    "the roughness of self - affine surfaces created by growth or recession processes have been described using scaling concepts @xcite .",
    "the width @xmath0 of a surface linear dimension @xmath1 at a time @xmath2 is given by    @xmath3    where the angular bra - ket @xmath4 denotes average over both lateral sites and different realizations of surface configurations .",
    "@xmath0 was found to scale as @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the lateral correlation length .",
    "@xmath7 is the scaling function which behaves such that for large time @xmath8 @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the roughness exponent ) , while in the early - time regime ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the growth exponent ) .",
    "different surfaces are classified into universality classes which share the same set of scaling exponents .",
    "some generic universality classes are mentioned in subsection c.    for rough surfaces formed by cyclical processes a suitable scaling law in terms of the number of cycles @xmath14 was introduced @xcite@xcite .",
    "the width @xmath15 for a system of linear size @xmath1 obeys the following scaling form :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the lateral correlation length and @xmath18 is the cyclical scaling function . for large time @xmath19 : @xmath9 , while for @xmath20 : @xmath21 , where @xmath13 is the growth exponent .",
    "again , different universality classes can be defined depending on the values of the exponents @xmath10 and @xmath22 . in most of the cases studied by us ,",
    "the scaling exponents of the cyclical process were identical to those of one of the primary processes ( the so - called dominating process ) .    in our previous papers on cyclical growth @xcite @xcite the durations of the primary processes ( in every cycle )",
    "were assumed to be uniform .",
    "however , in many realistic situations the durations of the primary processes will vary from cycle to cycle .",
    "the growth processes fall into different universality classes@xcite .",
    "all processes within one class share the same exponents and their asymptotic continuum stochastic equations differ at most by irrelevant terms ( in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense ) . using the symbolic index @xmath23 to denote different processes ,",
    "the ones we consider here follow growth equations of the form :    @xmath24    where @xmath25\\{@xmath26 is a local functional depending on the spatial derivatives of @xmath27 and the noise @xmath28 reflects the the random fluctuations in the deposition process and satisfies    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the substrate dimension .    some of the generic growth processes we will consider are :    \\(i ) linear : random deposition ( rd ) , edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite and mullins - herring ( mh ) @xcite@xcite @xcite .",

    "( 9 ) ) if the time variable is replaced by the _ number of cycles _ @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the dynamic scaling analysis ( eq . ( 7 ) ) of the structure factor can be used to determine the scaling exponents in the case of a cyclical growth .    in the regime of saturated roughness , after large number of cycles @xmath63 , eq .",
    "( 12 ) yields @xmath64 .",
    "the roughness exponent of the cyclic process is determined by the @xmath65 divergence of @xmath66 . since @xmath67t$ ] and @xmath68",

    ", the number of cycles @xmath14 is multiplied by @xmath70 in eq .",
    "the process with smaller @xmath69 will again dominate in the @xmath65 asymptotic limit .",
    "therefore , the primary process with the smaller dynamic exponent carries over its scaling exponents to the combined cyclical process .",
    "we extended our analysis to non - linear processes as well by using an approximate rg approach . in this approach",
    "we `` set aside '' the non - linear terms for the first few rg iterations in which all fluctuations on time scales smaller than the time one full cycle are integrated out .",
    "these few initial steps deals only with the linear parts of the two primary processes and result in an effective linear process , as described above . at this stage",
    "the non - linear terms are added back to the stochastic equation with their bare couplings multiplied by @xmath71 ( respectively , @xmath72 ) to take into account the fraction of time of their operation .",
    "the next iterations of the rg process then may be applied in the usual manner .",
    "this approach assumes that the approximation made in the few initial iterations will not change the ultimate fixed - points to which the rg flow take the system .",
    "we expect this to be the case if the system location in parameter space is not too close to a separatrix between two basins of attraction .",
    "now we are ready to consider the more general case of nonuniform durations of the two primary processes . the time elapsed during the first and the second processes in the @xmath73 application",
    "are denoted by @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "so @xmath74 and @xmath75 are assumed to be random variables obeying specific probability distribution functions ( _ pdf _ ) .",
    "we also define two new random variables @xmath76 $ ] and @xmath77 $ ] , in terms of which the structure factor of the cyclic process will be expressed .    the sf ,",
    "after the first primary process has taken place in the first cycle , turns out to be    @xmath78                       = \\frac{d_{1}}{a_{1}(q ) } ( 1 - \\xi_{1}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath79 is assumed for simplicity .",
    "hence , after one complete cycle the sf becomes    @xmath80    which can now be used as the initial sf for the first primary process of the next cycle . after the end of the @xmath81 cycle , the sf is    @xmath82    proceeding in this manner we finally arrive at the general expression of the sf after @xmath14 cycles    @xmath83    ( note the similarity of this sum of products of random variables to that encountered in 1d diffusion in random environment @xcite . for that system",

    "we need to take the average with respect to these @xmath86 of the sf in order to obtain the scaling behavior of the roughness .",
    "however , the above expression of the sf contains various products of the random variables @xmath87 and @xmath88 and in such situations the average behavior might differ from the typical behavior . since by definition @xmath89 $ ] and @xmath90 $ ] , they always take values less than one . thus ,",

    "the scaling exponents in this case of random application times may be extracted using the small @xmath58 divergence ( as done in the uniform case also ) of the average sf ( 19 ) , given in terms of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the averages of the variables @xmath87 and @xmath88 have been defined as    @xmath107    and    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the generating function ( laplace transform ) of @xmath110 .",
    "laplace transforms of similar random time intervals were considered by godrche and luck @xcite in the context of _ renewal processes_. in such stochastic processes _ events _ occur at the random epochs of time @xmath111 from some time origin @xmath48",
    ". change of sign of the position of a random walker is one such example .",
    "the intervals of time between those events are treated as independent and identically distributed random variables , very similar to the random duration of the primary processes in our case .",
    "depending on whether the mean of the probability distribution @xmath112 is finite or not , two different types of behavior are expected , as already observed in continuous fractal - time random walk @xcite and in the case of renewal processes @xcite .    *",
    "( i ) random application times with finite means : *    when the mean of the probability distribution is finite , we can write the averages of the random variables @xmath87 and @xmath88 in terms of a series    @xmath113    and    @xmath114    in the scaling limit of @xmath65 , _",
    "i.e. _ small @xmath115 , the higher order terms can be neglected with the result    @xmath116    again invoking the asymptotic limit @xmath65 , the primary process with smaller @xmath69 ( dynamic exponent ) dominates the average sf and hence the scaling behavior of the roughness .",
    "therefore , as long as the probability distribution has a finite mean , the scaling exponents corresponding to the average roughness are identical to those of the uniform duration case , with the average duration being the uniform period . in the next section",
    ", this will be shown explicitly for various probability distributions .",
    "we will also present results of numerical simulations which shows the validity of our conclusion even if one or both of the primary processes contain nonlinearity .    *",
    "( ii ) random application times with diverging mean : *    in some specific cases of broad distributions the average of the probability distribution diverges .",
    "one such example will be distribution with a fat power law tail @xmath117 with @xmath118 ( this is similar to the behavior found in continuous - time random walks , giving rise to the so - called _ fractal time _",
    "behavior @xcite . in this case , @xmath105 and @xmath106 in the scaling limit ( @xmath65 ) are given by @xcite    @xmath119    by putting @xmath120 , we obtain    @xmath121    hence , the dynamic exponents are modified as @xmath122 .",
    "the process with smaller @xmath69 will still dominate and yield the cyclical dynamic exponent @xmath123 . physically this modification is the consequence of the modified relation between the time and the number of cycles .",
    "if we ask what is the total time elapsed after @xmath14 applications of the two primary processes the answer is as follows : as long as the mean duration of one application is finite ( i.e. , @xmath124 for distributions with an algebraic tail ) , the total time is proportional to n times this mean duration . for power - law distributions with @xmath125 and diverging mean ,",
    "the dominating contribution to the total time comes from a finite number of applications , each of them lasting a time of the order of @xmath126 .",
    "this also implies that for such systems in which the roughness grows with time as @xmath127 ( where @xmath22 is the growth exponent of the primary process with the smaller @xmath128 ) , it will grow as @xmath129 with the number of applications @xmath14 .    after a large number of cycles ,",
    "once the roughness becomes saturated , the roughness exponent @xmath10 of the grown self - affine surface should not depend on the random application times of the primary processes .",
    "as a result , the exponent @xmath10 will remain unchanged from the corresponding uniform duration case , which is nothing but the @xmath10 of the primary process with smaller @xmath128 .",
    "this is consistent with our prior observation that the growth exponent @xmath22 is modified as @xmath130 , so that the scaling relation @xmath131 remains valid .",
    "so for @xmath118 , the exponent @xmath22 changes continuously depending on the values of @xmath132 .    for two primary processes with durations having two different values of @xmath132 of the power law distributions",
    "the new dynamic exponent becomes @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , where @xmath135 .",
    "if one of the processes ( say for @xmath136 ) has a finite mean while that of the second ( @xmath137 ) is diverging , the value of the @xmath138 will be : @xmath139 , with similar expressions for @xmath10 and @xmath22 .      *",
    "( i ) application times with finite mean : *    in this case we expect our approximate rg approach , introduced for periodic processes and described in the previous section , to still be applicable .",
    "the few initial rg iterations will coarse grain all time - fluctuations smaller than a typical time of the order of the average time period ( the sum of the mean application times of the two primary processes ) .",
    "although the distributions will always allow remaining fluctuations from cycles longer than the mean , their probability decreases with their length and we do not anticipate them to be relevant to the long time behavior .    *",
    "( ii ) random application times with diverging mean : *    in this case the approximate rg can not be applied since the dominating effect is contributed from a few extremly long applications , rather than from the accumulation of n applications .",
    "this behavior strongly suggests that each of the primary processes should be renormalized independently form the other and their relative contributions should be compared based on their fully - renormalized scaling behavior ( contrary to the case ( i ) above where the renormalization is carried on after the two processes have been combined to a single effective process ) .",
    "if that would be the case , the former result @xmath140 , will hold in general with the z(i ) of the two primary processes _ whether they are linear or not_. the exponent @xmath141 will be given by the larger of @xmath142 .",
    "@xmath10 will simply be that of the dominating process determining @xmath138 .    *",
    "( iii ) random application times with one finite and one diverging mean : *    if one of the two processes ( say the first one ) has a finite mean application time while it diverges for the other ( the @xmath81 ) , some special care is required .",
    "we can again imagine performing a few initial rg iterations until the average duration of the first process is of order one .",
    "the duration of the second process will be rescaled by the same rescaling factor but will continue to be dominated by the few extremly long applications .",
    "if we have @xmath143 to begin with , then @xmath144 as before . if , on the other hand we begin with @xmath145 , then @xmath146 is unaffected during the initial rg iterations and we have to compare the contribution from n applications of the first process with the few extremly long applications of the second one .",
    "again , we expect the smaller of @xmath146 and @xmath147 will dominate and yields @xmath138 of the combined process . in short these results amount to assigning the value @xmath148 for the finite - mean process and using again the same expressions for @xmath138 and @xmath141 in _ ( ii ) _ above .",
    "below we will consider different probability distributions @xmath112 ( both discrete and continuous ) , and try to determine the scaling behavior using the sf ( 19 ) .",
    "the variables defined in the previous section will continue to be used .",
    "the average duration of the two primary processes will be denoted by @xmath45 and @xmath149 for all types of probability distributions ( as long as the average exists and finite ) .",
    "we have carried out numerical simulation of various linear and nonlinear discrete growth models to verify our results corresponding to different probability distributions . the system size used in our simulation",
    "was varied between 128 to 4096 lattice units .",
    "periodic boundary condition is employed to keep the finite size effects to a minimum .",

    "the roughness exponent @xmath10 remain unchanged in all those cases .",
    "therefore , for intermittent applications with a diverging average , the dynamic exponent and the growth exponent start to differ from those of the uniform case whereas the roughness exponent remains the same .",
    "we are now in a position to provide the answers to the two central questions we posed at the beginning of this paper :    \\1 .",
    "to what extent the cyclical growth behavior describes also randomly alternating processes ? - the scaling behavior of the perfectly periodic growth processes continues to hold for random application times as long as the latter have finite means .",
    "small fluctuations in the application times are thus irrelevant . for linear systems",
    "it means that the primary process with the smallest dynamic exponent will dominate . for non - linear processes ,",
    "the approximate rg procedure devised for cyclical processes may still be applied to extract the asymptotic scaling behavior .",
    "\\2 . when cyclical growth fails to describe randomly alternating processes , what are the their new scaling properties ?",
    "if at least the distribution of one of the application time decays as a power law @xmath200 with @xmath201 ( such that its mean diverges ) , the effective dynamic exponent is reduced by a multiplicative factor @xmath132 . for linear processes",
    "it definitely implies that the process with the smallest effective dynamic exponent dominates ( the value of @xmath202 should be assigned for processes with a finite mean ) .",
    "we claim that the same continues to hold for non - linear processes as well .",
    "this claim follows from the fact that a primary process with a diverging mean application time is dominated by a few especially long applications and therefore renormalizes independently from the other primary process .",
    "theoretical studies to further confirm this behavior will be most welcome .    as far as experimental investigations are concerned , they should be straightforward for systems with finite means ( e.g. , by methods similar to those used to measure the scaling behavior of cyclical growth )",
    ". it will be more challenging to conduct experimental investigations of surface growth by randomly alternating processes where at least one of them has a diverging mean application time .",
