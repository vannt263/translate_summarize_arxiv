    "the insurgence of critical electric fields in the process of gravitational collapse leading to vacuum polarization process @xcite has convinced us of the necessity of critically reexamining the gravitational and electrodynamical properties in neutron stars . in this light",
    "we have recently generalized the feynman , metropolis and teller treatment of compressed atoms to the relativistic regimes @xcite .",
    "we have so enforced , self - consistently in a relativistic thomas - fermi equation , the condition of @xmath0-equilibrium extending the works of v.  s.  popov @xcite , ya .",

    "@xcite and r.  ruffini and l.  stella @xcite for heavy nuclei .",
    "thanks to the existence of scaling laws ( see @xcite and @xcite ) this treatment has been extrapolated to compressed nuclear matter cores of stellar dimensions with mass numbers @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "such configurations fulfill global but not local charge neutrality .",
    "they have electric fields on the core surface , increasing for decreasing values of the electron fermi energy @xmath4 reaching values much larger than the critical value @xmath5 , for @xmath6 .",
    "the assumption of constant distribution of protons at nuclear densities simulates , in such a treatment , the confinement due to the strong interactions in the case of nuclei and heavy nuclei and due to both the gravitational field and the strong interactions in the case of nuclear matter cores of stellar sizes .    in this article",
    "we introduce explicitly the effects of gravitation by considering a general relativistic system of degenerate fermions composed of neutrons , protons and electrons in @xmath0-equilibrium : this is the simplest nontrivial system in which new electrodynamical and general relativistic properties of the equilibrium configuration can be clearly and rigorously illustrated .",
    "we first prove that the condition of local charge neutrality can never be implemented since it violates necessary conditions of equilibrium at the microphysical scale .",
    "we then prove the existence of a solution with global , but not local , charge neutrality by taking into account essential gravito - electrodynamical effects .",
    "first we recall the constancy of the general relativistic fermi energy of each specie pioneered by o.  klein @xcite .",
    "we subsequently introduce the general relativistic thomas - fermi equations for the three fermion species fulfilling relativistic quantum statistics , governed by the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "the solution of this system of equations presents a formidable mathematical challenge in theoretical physics .",
    "the traditional difficulties encountered in proving the existence and unicity of the solution of the thomas - fermi equation @xcite are here enhanced by the necessity of solving the general relativistic thomas - fermi equation coupled with the einstein - maxwell system of equations .",
    "we present the general solution for the equilibrium configuration , from the center of the star all the way to the border , giving the details of the gravitational field , of the electrodynamical field as well as of the conserved quantities .",
    "we illustrate such a solution by selecting a central density @xmath7 , where @xmath8 g @xmath9 is the nuclear density .",
    "we point out the existence near the boundary of the core in the equilibrium configuration of three different radii , in decreasing order : @xmath10 corresponding to the vanishing of the fermi momentum of the electron component ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 corresponding to the vanishing of the fermi momentum of the proton component ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 corresponding to the radius at which the fermi momentum of neutrons vanishes : @xmath15 .",
    "we then give explicit expressions for the proton versus electron density ratio and the proton versus neutron density ratio for any value of the radial coordinate as well as for the electric potential at the center of the configuration .",
    "a novel situation occurs : the description of the pressure and density is not anylonger a local one .",
    "their determination needs prior knowledge of the global electrodynamical and gravitational potentials on the entire system as well as of the radii @xmath14 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 .",
    "this is a necessary outcome of the self - consistent solution of the eigenfunction within general relativistic thomas - fermi equation in the einstein - maxwell background .",
    "as expected from the considerations in @xcite , the electric potential at the center of the configuration fulfills @xmath16 and the gravitational potential @xmath17 .",
    "the implementation of the constancy of the general relativistic fermi energy of each particle species and the consequent system of equations illustrated here is the simplest possible example admitting a rigorous nontrivial solution .",
    "it will necessarily apply in the case of additional particle species and of the inclusion of nuclear interactions : in this cases however it is not sufficient and the contribution of nuclear fields must be taken into due account .",
    "we consider the equilibrium configurations of a degenerate gas of neutrons , protons and electrons with total matter energy density and total matter pressure @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relativistic single particle energy .",
    "in addition , we require the condition of @xmath0-equilibrium between neutrons , protons and electrons @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the fermi momentum and @xmath22 is the free - chemical potential of particle - species with number density @xmath23 .",
    "we now introduce the extension to general relativity of the thomas - fermi equilibrium condition on the generalized fermi energy @xmath4 of the electron component @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fundamental charge , @xmath26 is the coulomb potential of the configuration and we have introduced the metric @xmath27 for a spherically symmetric non - rotating neutron star .",
    "the metric function @xmath28 is related to the mass @xmath29 and the electric field @xmath30 ( a prime stands for radial derivative ) through @xmath31 thus the equations for the neutron star equilibrium configuration consist of the following einstein - maxwell equations and general relativistic thomas - fermi equation @xmath32 = - 4 \\pi \\alpha \\hbar c \\ , { \\rm e}^{\\nu/2 } { \\rm e}^{\\lambda } \\bigg\\ { n_p \\nonumber \\\\ % % & & - \\frac{{\\rm e}^{-3 \\nu/2}}{3 \\pi^2}[\\hat{v}^2 + 2 m_e c^2 \\hat{v } - m^2_e c^4 ( { \\rm e}^{\\nu}-1)]^{3/2}\\bigg\\}\\ , , \\label{eq : grtf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 denotes the fine structure constant , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and we have used eq .",
    "( [ eq : electroneq ] ) to obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : grtf ] ) .",
    "it can be demonstrated that the assumption of the equilibrium condition ( [ eq : electroneq ] ) together with the @xmath0-equilibrium condition ( [ eq : betaeq ] ) and the hydrostatic equilibrium ( [ eq : tov ] ) is enough to guarantee the constancy of the generalized fermi energy @xmath36 for all particle species separately .",
    "here @xmath37 denotes the particle unit charge of the @xmath38-species .",
    "indeed , as shown by olson and bailyn @xcite , when the fermion nature of the constituents and their degeneracy is taken into account , in the configuration of minimum energy the generalized fermi energies @xmath39 defined by ( [ eq : olsoneq ] ) must be constant over the entire configuration .",
    "these minimum energy conditions generalize the equilibrium conditions of klein @xcite and of kodama and yamada @xcite to the case of degenerate multicomponent fluids with particle species with non - zero unit charge .",
    "if one were to assume , as often done in literature , the local charge neutrality condition @xmath40 instead of assuming the equilibrium condition ( [ eq : electroneq ] ) , this would lead to @xmath41 identically ( since there will be no electric fields generated by the neutral matter distribution ) implying via eqs .",
    "( [ eq : betaeq ] ) and ( [ eq : tov ] ) @xmath42 thus the neutron fermi energy would be constant throughout the configuration as well as the sum of the proton and electron fermi energies but not the individual fermi energies of each component . in fig",
    ".  [ fig:1 ] we show the results of the einstein equations for a selected value of the central density of a system of degenerate neutrons , protons , and electrons in @xmath0-equilibrium under the constraint of local charge neutrality . in particular , we have plotted the fermi energy of the particle species in units of the pion rest - energy .",
    "it can be seen that indeed the fermi energies of the protons and electrons are not constant throughout the configuration which would lead to microscopic instability .",
    "this proves the impossibility of having a self - consistent configuration fulfilling the condition of local charge neutrality for our system .",
    "this result is complementary to the conclusion of eq .",
    "( 4.6 ) of @xcite who found that , at zero temperature , only a dust solution with zero particle kinetic energy can satisfy the condition of local charge neutrality and such a configuration is clearly unacceptable for an equilibrium state of a self - gravitating system .    , where @xmath43 g @xmath9 denotes the nuclear density .",
    "we turn now to describe the equilibrium configurations fulfilling only global charge neutrality .",
    "we solve self - consistently eqs .",

    "( [ eq : tov ] ) for the hydrostatic equilibrium of the three degenerate fermions and , in addition , we impose eq .",
    "( [ eq : betaeq ] ) for the @xmath0-equilibrium . the crucial equation relating the proton and the electron distributions",

    "the solution for the particle densities , the gravitational potential , the coulomb potential and the electric field are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : fig2 ] ) for a configuration with central density @xmath49 . in order to compare our results with those obtained in the case of nuclear matter cores of stellar dimensions @xcite as well as to analyze the gravito - electrodynamical stability of the configuration we have plotted the electric potential in units of the pion rest - energy and the gravitational potential in units of the pion - to - proton mass ratio .",
    "one particular interesting new feature is the approach to the boundary of the configuration : three different radii are present corresponding to distinct radii at which the individual particle fermi pressure vanishes .",
    "the radius @xmath10 for the electron component corresponding to @xmath50 , the radius @xmath12 for the proton component corresponding to @xmath51 and the radius @xmath14 for the neutron component corresponding to @xmath52 .",
    "the smallest radius @xmath14 is due to the threshold energy for @xmath0-decay which occurs at a density @xmath53 g @xmath9 .",
    "the radius @xmath12 is larger than @xmath14 because the proton mass is slightly smaller than the neutron mass .",
    "instead , @xmath54 due to a combined effect of the difference between the proton and electron masses and the implementation of the global charge neutrality condition through the thomas - fermi equilibrium conditions .    for the configuration of fig .",
