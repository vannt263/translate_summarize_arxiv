    "<S> the direct production rate of @xmath0 via the color - octet mechanism is calculated at the @xmath1 resonance . the color - octet production process @xmath2 is shown to have a substantial branching ratio as well as a distinctive energy spectrum , which can be used as a powerful tool to distinguish from the color - singlet direct production of the @xmath0 .    6.5 in    -1 cm    * color - octet quarkonium production at the @xmath1 pole *    kingman cheung    _ center for particle physics , university of texas at austin , austin , tx 78712 _    wai - yee keung    _ physics department , university of illinois at chicago , il 60607 - 7059 + fermilab , p.o . </S>",
    "<S> box 500 , batavia , il 60510 _    tzu chiang yuan    _ davis institute for high energy physics + university of california at davis , davis , ca 95616 _    despite charmonium and bottomonium have been discovered some times ago , heavy quarkonium physics has constantly drawn a lot of attentions from theorists . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly due to the property of asymptotic freedom of qcd which allows theorists to calculate perturbatively the short - distance part in the production and in the decay rates of quarkonia , while the incalculable long - distance part can be factored out and absorbed into the wave - function for the ground state or its derivatives for higher orbital excitations . </S>",
    "<S> confinement implies that quarkonium must be seen as a color - singlet object . </S>",
    "<S> the most natural assumption to make in the calculation of the short - distance part of quarkonium production or decay rate is that the heavy quark - antiquark pair inside the bound state is produced or annihilated with the same orbital angular momentum , spin , and color of the asymptotic physical quarkonium states . </S>",
    "<S> this simple picture dubbed as the color - singlet model @xcite in the literature is derivable from qcd and has greater predictive power than other alternatives @xcite like the color - evaporation model or the local duality approach .    during the past several years </S>",
    "<S> , a wealth of quarkonium data collected by the cdf detector at the tevatron has posted great challenge to the naive color - singlet model . with the advance of the technology of silicon vertex detector , cdf in the 1992 - 1993 run was able to separate their quarkonium data into two vast classes @xcite : the first class can all be traced back to a secondary displaced vertex which is a few microns away from the interaction point and presumably they are all coming indirectly from b meson decays ; the second class of the data was called prompt because it comes from direct qcd production . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the rates for the prompt @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 at the large transverse momentum region were observed to be orders of magnitude above the lowest order perturbative calculation based on the color - singlet model @xcite .    to resolve these discrepancies </S>",
    "<S> one needs to seek for new production mechanisms as well as new physical insights that go beyond the color - singlet model . the factorization model based on non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) recently advocated by bodwin , braaten , and lepage @xcite provides a new framework to calculate the inclusive production and decay rates of quarkonium to any order in strong coupling constant @xmath6 , as well as to any order in @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the typical relative velocity of the heavy quarks inside the bound state . at the same time , the importance of fragmentation contributions to the quarkonium production at the tevatron was also pointed out by braaten and yuan @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> parton fragmentation into quarkonium is formally of higher order in strong coupling constant but they can be enhanced over the traditional lowest order gluon - fusion mechanism @xcite at sufficiently high transverse momentum . however , cross sections for prompt @xmath3 and @xmath4 production were observed to be more than an order of magnitude above the predictions based on the color - singlet model even after the inclusion of the fragmentation contributions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one crucial feature of the factorization model is that quarkonium is not solely regarded as simply a quark - antiquark pair but rather a superposition of fock states . in the light - cone gauge , </S>",
    "<S> the fock state expansion for the @xmath3 is @xmath9 where the angular momenta of the @xmath10 pair in each fock state is labeled by @xmath11 with a color configuration of either @xmath12 or @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> a novel idea proposed by braaten and fleming @xcite to explain the cdf data on prompt @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) production is due to a color - octet term in the gluon fragmentation function into @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this term corresponds to the case where the fragmenting gluon forms a @xmath14 pair in the color - octet @xmath15 state at the short - distance of order @xmath16 or smaller , and subsequently evolves non - perturbatively into the physical @xmath3 or @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - perturbative effects are represented by the nrqcd matrix element @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these color - octet matrix elements are suppressed by order @xmath19 relative to the corresponding color - singlet matrix elements @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the short - distance factor computed in perturbative theory for this color - octet process is only of order @xmath22 , which is enhanced by a factor of @xmath23 relative to the color - singlet process . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the suppression in the color - octet matrix element can be easily compensated by the enhancement in the corresponding short - distance factor when compared with the color - singlet process . </S>",
    "<S> the cdf data for @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) can be explained by including this color - octet term in the gluon fragmentation function and by adjusting the value for the matrix element @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) to fit the data @xcite .    while the color - octet mechanism can easily explain the transverse momentum spectrum of the quarkonium measured at the tevatron </S>",
    "<S> , the normalization can not be determined a priori . </S>",
    "<S> one has to rely upon the cdf @xmath3 and @xmath4 data to extract the unknown color - octet matrix elements . in order to establish firmly our belief of the color - octet mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , it is therefore important to identify these color - octet quarkonium signals in other production processes . </S>",
    "<S> recently , cho and leibovich @xcite have studied color - octet quarkonium production at the tevatron using exact tree - level calculations rather than the fragmentation approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this approach allows them to probe the cdf charmonium and bottomonium data at almost the whole range of transverse momentum . </S>",
    "<S> braaten and chen @xcite showed that the color - octet mechanism can give rise to a distinctive signature at the upper endpoint of the energy distribution of @xmath3 at cleo energy . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we study the prompt quarkonium production by the color - octet mechanism at the @xmath1 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this work was motivated by the capability of the lep detectors to separate the prompt @xmath3 from those coming from b decays @xcite . besides , the preliminary results of prompt @xmath3 production at lep @xcite suggested almost a factor of ten larger than the prediction of the most dominant color - singlet process via charm quark fragmentation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we shall show that the most important color - octet process will give rise to a branching ratio substantially larger than the most dominant color - singlet process and is consistent with the preliminary lep results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the energy spectrum predicted by the color - octet production process is very soft and should be distinguishable from that produced by the most dominant color - singlet process . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our consideration of @xmath3 production in @xmath1 decays is crucial in verifying the importance of the color - octet mechanism in quarkonium production .    according to the factorization formalism @xcite , the differential rate for the inclusive production of a charmonium state @xmath24 with momentum @xmath25 from @xmath1 decay </S>",
    "<S> can be written in a factored form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the partonic decay rate for producing a @xmath10 pair with total momentum @xmath25 , vanishing relative momentum , and in an angular momentum and color state labeled collectively by @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the long - distance factor @xmath29 is the nrqcd matrix element describing the probability for the formation of the quarkonium state @xmath24 from a @xmath14 pair in the state @xmath28 .    the leading order color - singlet processes are @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although both processes are of order @xmath32 , the latter is two orders of magnitude larger . </S>",
    "<S> the latter process has been interpreted as a fragmentation process in which the @xmath14 pair was first produced almost on - shell from the @xmath1 decay and then followed by the fragmentation of @xmath33 or @xmath34 into the @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the process @xmath35 is not suppressed by the quark propagator effect of order @xmath36 as it does in the process @xmath37 . in the fragmentation approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the energy distribution of @xmath3 in the process @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 denotes the energy of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> both processes involve the same matrix element @xmath43 whose value can be extracted from the leptonic width to be about @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , the widths for @xmath37 and @xmath31 are about @xmath45 gev and @xmath46 gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a higher order color - singlet process @xmath47 followed by the gluon fragmentation @xmath48 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio was estimated to be of order @xmath49 only @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the recent results from lep @xcite showed a branching ratio of order @xmath50 for prompt @xmath3 production , which is well above all the predictions from the color - singlet model .    </S>",
    "<S> the leading order color - octet process is of order @xmath6 given by the process @xmath51 , for which one of the feynman diagrams is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is understood that soft hadrons are around to match the color . </S>",
    "<S> the decay rate of this channel is given by @xmath52 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and we have used a heavy quark spin symmetry relation @xmath57 . this color - octet process has a very distinctive signature that the @xmath3 has an energy equal one - half of the @xmath1 mass and is recoiled by a hard gluon jet . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the short - distance factors are suppressed by at least one power of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , the width for @xmath58 is of order @xmath59 gev which renders this process useless at the @xmath1 resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> the dominant color - octet process actually begins at the order @xmath32 in the process @xmath60 , for which one of the feynman diagrams is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath61 represents @xmath62 , or @xmath63 . </S>",

    "<S> the physical range of @xmath67 is @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> similar expression was derived before for the process @xmath69 in qed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the above exact result can be simplified into the following form in the limit @xmath70 : @xmath71   \\ ; .\\ ] ] following the same procedures in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one can show that the above limit corresponds to the sum of the fragmentation processes of @xmath72 followed by @xmath73 or @xmath74 and @xmath75 followed by @xmath76 .    using the value for the color - octet matrix element @xmath77 extracted from the fit to prompt @xmath3 data at the tevatron @xcite , @xmath78 gev , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 </S>",
    "<S> , we show the energy distribution of @xmath3 for this process in fig .  2 ( solid curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the decay width of @xmath60 can also be obtained by integrating eq .  </S>",

    "<S> since the event topology of our color - octet process is similar to this one , this limit should also be valid for our color - octet process . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our result is consistent with this data .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 we compare the energy distributions of @xmath3 coming from the most important color - octet process @xmath89 using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exact ] ) and the most dominant color - singlet process @xmath31 using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 14 ] ) . for the color - octet process </S>",
    "<S> we have summed over all quark flavors , @xmath90 , in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison in fig .  2 shows a very spectacular difference between the color - octet and color - singlet processes . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum for the color - octet process is very soft with a pronounced peak at the lower @xmath67 end , while the spectrum for the color - singlet process is rather hard because of the nature of heavy quark fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> though the spectrum for the color - singlet process will be softened somewhat by including higher order qcd corrections @xcite , the spectacular difference remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> another striking result is that the color - octet spectrum dominates over the color - singlet one for all values of @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that this color - octet contribution should not be neglected !    </S>",
    "<S> the energy distributions for the @xmath4 and @xmath91 coming from the color - octet and color - singlet processes are similar to those illustrated above for the @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the color - octet contributions can also be shown for these two cases as well . </S>",
    "<S> the rates for direct @xmath4 production are roughly scaled down by a factor of 5 from those of the @xmath3 shown in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the production of @xmath92 by the color - singlet process @xmath93 and the color - octet process @xmath94 are similar to that of @xmath3 , but with smaller branching ratios . </S>",
    "<S> details will be presented elsewhere .    in closing </S>",
    "<S> , we have considered the color - octet quarkonium production at the @xmath1 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant direct production of @xmath3 is shown to be the color - octet process @xmath60 , which is a few times larger than the most dominant color - singlet production process @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the energy spectrum of the @xmath3 for the color - octet mechanism has been shown to be very different from that of the color - singlet process . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , measurements of the decay width and the energy spectrum for the prompt @xmath3 production at lep can further confirm the importance of the color - octet mechanism .    this work was supported in part by the united states department of energy under grant numbers de - fg02 - 84er40173 , de - fg03 - 93er40757 , and de - fg03 - 91er40674 .    </S>",
