    "the generalized polytropic eos @xmath2 is the union of linear and polytropic eos .",
    "it is widely used in cosmology to explain different era of universe with the help of mathematical models . in cosmic scenario",
    "@xmath66 was taken to be planck density but for relativistic discussion we have taken it as mass density and total energy density in case * 1 * and case * 2 * , respectively . in order to discuss the physical features of newtonian and relativistic ploytropes , we have formulated the general formalism to obtain modified lee .",
    "the solutions of the lee are called polytropes , which depend on density profile function of dimensionless radius @xmath72 and the order of solution is constrained with value of polytropic index @xmath45 .",
    "the lee are helpful to explain relativistic co as they produced simple solution to describe the internal structure of co. but the cost of simplicity is a power law relationship between pressure and density which should be valid throughout the inner matter of co. the lee have been initially developed for relativistic charged ploytropes with anisotropic factor involved in them ( see eqs.@xmath84 and @xmath100 ) , which have three unknown variables .",
    "the conformally flat conditions is used to simplify these equations by eliminating anisotropy factor , which corresponds to modified lee ( see eqs.@xmath116 and @xmath118 ) , for charged polytropic spheres in the context of generalized polytropic eos .",
    "the energy conditions are helpful in order to check the physical viability of co in gr without enforcing eos .",
    "the energy conditions for both cases of relativistic polytropes has been developed in the presence of charge .",
    "the stability of the relativistic polytropes is analyzed with the help of tolman mass . for case * 1 * , the model behaved well as shown in figures * 1 - 3*. the model developed here are anisotropic ( in pressure ) and helped us to discuss highly charged co solutions .",
    "figure * 1 * represents the physical behavior of tolman mass for different values of charge and model s parameters @xcite . the tolman mass which is the measure of active gravitational mass gradually shifts towards the boundary surface but remain stable and did not presents any fluctuations . figure",
    "* 1 * represents that slow migration of the tolman mass towards the boundary as charge increases corresponds to more stability of the model .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that our results for tolman mass are considerably consistent with work of herrera et al .",
    "@xcite for polytropic eos .",
    "figure * 2 * describes the solution of eq.@xmath83 which shows that the stability of the model can be enhanced through decreasing the values of @xmath146 . this figure has been plotted for indicated values of triplet @xmath150 and shows stable behavior for small values of @xmath93 . also , the configuration of solution remain stable for increasing value of charge , although solution curves start bending towards the boundary of the co as shown in figure * 2*. it is also evident that the behavior of parameter is disperse in the beginning i.e. , near the center of co and it becomes more consistent as we move towards the boundary with the increase of charge .",
    "so , we can say charge is the stabilizing factor here for relativistic polytropes with generalized polytropic eos .",
    "thus , the discussion of charge is essential for the study and exploration of relativistic polytropic co for their physical viability .    the inclusion of anisotropy plays a vital role to study the astrophysical co. the inner fluid distribution is assumed to be anisotropic for spherically symmetric co. figure * 3 * represents the graphs of @xmath130 , which is the ratio of anisotropy and central mass density . the curves remains stable even after increase of charge but rapidly move towards boundary of sphere and this phenomenon shows that anisotropy is affected by the presence of electromagnetic field",
    "hence , the presence of anisotropy with charge may lead towards gravitational collapse of polytropic co and can also be a source of cracking phenomenon .",
    "the presence of cracking can be tested by means of methods provided by herrera @xcite and gonzalez @xcite . in this work ,",
    "methods for the development of generalized lee have been presented .",
    "we observe that , in case * 2 * polytropes are not physically viable due to violation of energy conditions .",
