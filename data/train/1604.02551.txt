    "we formulate the main idea of the lets from a somewhat different perspective as compared to ref .",
    "@xcite , where a quantum mechanical framework of the modified effective range expansion  @xcite was employed .",
    "we assume that the nn interaction is characterized by two distinct scales @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , so that the potential can be written as @xmath24 with the interaction ranges of the order of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude near threshold is governed by the long - range interactions .",
    "taking into account the discontinuity across the left - hand cut from the long - range potential @xmath27 , the energy dependence of the scattering amplitude can be predicted in a model independent way up to the energies corresponding to the branch point of a more distant left - hand cut associated with the potential @xmath28 .",
    "this prediction can be regarded as a low - energy theorem .",
    "alternatively , one can view the lets as correlations between the parameters in the effective - range expansion of the inverse scattering amplitude induced by long - range interactions .",
    "notice that the inverse scattering amplitude may possess poles in the near - threshold region , whose appearance does not affect the validity range of the lets if the scattering amplitude is kept unexpanded .",
    "the longest - range part of the nn force is due to the one - pion exchange potential ( opep ) .",
    "thus , the let for nn scattering are expected to be governed by the left - hand cut generated by the opep .",
    "the opep is , however , singular at the origin and requires regularization and renormalization .",
    "therefore , instead of using the quantum mechanical approach , we formulate the let within the modified weinberg approach of chiral eft @xcite . since the correlations between the effective range expansion parameters are inherently long - range phenomena , the results after renormalization and removing the ultraviolet cutoff should be model and regularization - scheme independent .",
    "to be specific , we calculate the scattering amplitude @xmath29 by solving the lippmann - schwinger - type integral equation introduced originally by kadyshevsky  @xcite which , for the case of the fully off - shell kinematics , has the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the free green function @xmath32 further , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the incoming ( outgoing ) three - momentum of the nucleon in the cms and @xmath35 with @xmath36 denoting the nucleon mass and @xmath37 being the corresponding ( on - mass - shell ) three - momentum .",
    "the @xmath6-wave potential at leading order ( lo ) consists of the opep and two derivative - less contact interactions ( here denoted @xmath38 for each given partial wave ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) denote the spin ( isospin ) pauli matrices of the nucleon @xmath42 , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 refer to the axial vector coupling of the nucleon and the pion decay constant , respectively . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lo integral equation in this framework is exactly renormalizable scattering see ref .  @xcite .",
    "this paper also addresses chiral extrapolations of the @xmath45 binding energy .",
    "] , that is all ultraviolet divergencies appearing from iterations of the lo potential can be removed via an appropriate redefinition of the contact interaction @xmath38 . as a consequence , the cutoff in the integral equation can be put to infinity , so that no finite - cutoff artifacts can affect the let .",
    "the integral equation ( [ meqlok0integrated ] ) with the potential ( [ vlo ] ) can , in general , be only solved numerically .",
    "however , the correlations between the parameters of the effective range expansion implied by the lets can be demonstrated analytically . for simplicity reasons , we consider the partial wave projected @xmath29-matrix in an uncoupled channel with the zero orbital angular momentum , whereas generalizations to the coupled - channel case and to non - zero angular momenta are straightforward . since the lo contact interaction is separable , it is possible to write the solution for the @xmath29-matrix in the semi - analytic ( operator ) form @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the off - shell solution of the projected integral equation ( [ g ] ) with the opep alone ( @xmath48 ) , whereas the functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 , shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : blocks ] , involve convolutions of this pionic amplitude with the point - like vertex , namely @xmath51    1 true cm   graphical illustration of the functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 in eq .  , which correspond to convolutions of the pionic amplitude @xmath52 with the point - like vertices as explained in the text.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ]    to complete the renormalization program at lo , one has to express the contact interaction @xmath38 in terms of the scattering amplitude at zero momentum , that is the scattering length @xmath53 , which is assumed to be an input quantity .",
    "thus , the on - shell nn amplitude reads @xmath54 where we used the shorthand notation @xmath55 .",
    "for an uncoupled channel with the zero orbital angular momentum , the scattering amplitude @xmath56 can be expressed in terms of the so - called effective range function @xmath57 via @xmath58 we are now in the position to formulate the lets at lo : using the scattering length as the only input quantity to fix the unknown low - energy constant , we employ eqs .",
    "( [ tmaton])-([fk ] ) to predict the momentum dependence of the scattering amplitude and to calculate the phase shifts @xmath59 .",
    "such a prediction is possible because all information about the longest - range ope potential and , in particular , about the discontinuity across the corresponding left - hand cut starting from the momentum @xmath60 , is explicitly taken into account in the calculation .    unlike the scattering amplitude",
    ", the effective range function does not possess the kinematic unitarity cut and is a real meromorphic function of @xmath61 near the origin @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "it can , therefore , be taylor - expanded about the origin leading to the effective range expansion @xmath63 where @xmath16 is the effective range , while @xmath64 are the so - called shape parameters .",
    "thus , a single piece of information in the form of the scattering length ( or the energy of a bound / virtual state ) allows one to predict all the coefficients in the effective range expansion @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are polynomials in the inverse scattering length , namely @xmath68 with the coefficients @xmath69 and @xmath70 being calculable from the various quantities appearing in eq .",
    "( [ tmaton ] ) and their derivatives evaluated at @xmath62 .",
    "their explicit form can be easily obtained by performing taylor expansion of the inverse amplitude @xmath71 around @xmath72 .",
    "given that the left - hand cut from the opep is explicitly included , the convergence radius of the lets is restricted by the next - to - lowest - lying left - hand singularity associated with the two - pion exchange potential ( tpep ) . in the present analysis ,",
    "we take into account the contributions of the tpep implicitly by including the relevant momentum - dependent short - range interactions at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , whose strengths have to be adjusted to reproduce the empirical value of the effective range in the corresponding channel . then , the shape parameters can be predicted up - to - and - including the nlo corrections .",
    "after renormalization , the predictions for the lets become insensitive to details of the short - range interaction once its strength is adjusted to reproduce the physical observable . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is convenient to employ resonance saturation via a heavy - meson exchange in order to model higher - order contact interaction without destroying explicit renormalizability of the integral equation or having to rely on perturbation theory . specifically , the nlo correction to the potential is taken in the form @xmath73 where the heavy - meson mass @xmath74 is set to be @xmath75  mev and the strength @xmath76 is adjusted to reproduce the empirical value of the effective range in the @xmath2 and the @xmath1 channels .",
    "our results are not sensitive to the functional form of the term parameterizing the subleading short - range interaction in eq .",
    "( [ satur ] ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "we now summarize the main findings of ref .",
    "@xcite for the physical value of the pion mass :    * in the @xmath1 channel , the lets yield very accurate results already at lo .",
    "for example , the effective range is predicted with an accuracy better than @xmath77 .",
    "the accuracy at lo even appears to be better than one could naively expect from the ratio of scales corresponding to the explicitly included lowest left - hand cut from the opep and the next - to - lowest one from the tpep , which is not considered explicitly at this order .",
    "this observation can be understood by noticing that iterations of the opep do actually generate the dominant contributions to the left - hand cuts due to the two- and multiple - pion exchange . *",
    "the accuracy of the lets in the @xmath2 channel is much worse than in the spin - triplet case .",
    "this has to be expected due to the weakness of the opep in that channel .",
    "indeed , the opep contributes less than @xmath78 to the magnitude of the empirical @xmath2 phase shift at its maximum value . * as expected , the predicted values of the shape parameters at nlo show in both channels a clear improvement as compared with the lo results .",
    "in particular , the nlo lets appear to be accurate at the level of a few percent for the @xmath1 channel ( except for @xmath79 which is unnaturally small ) , while the accuracy of the predictions in the @xmath2 channel is improved to @xmath80 .",
    "a generalization of the lets to the case of unphysical pion masses can be carried out straightforwardly  @xcite .",
    "the main dynamical effect of changing the pion mass in the opep corresponds to shifts of the branch points of all left - hand cuts .",
    "the discontinuity across the left - hand cuts also changes due to the dependence of the ratio @xmath81 , which determines the strength of the opep , on the pion mass . ]",
    "finally , the discontinuity across the left - hand cuts is also affected by the @xmath14-dependence of the nucleon mass through its appearance in the integral equation ( [ meqlok0integrated ] ) . to account for the last two effects in a way that minimizes the theoretical uncertainty , we use lattice - qcd results for the @xmath14 dependence of @xmath82 and @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , we performed quadratic polynomial regression fits ( as functions of @xmath83 ) of the lattice - qcd data for pion masses up to @xmath84mev as shown in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "we refer the reader to this paper for more details on the fits and references to the included lattice - qcd calculations of these quantities . using the above results , we can generalize the lo lets by calculating the effective range function @xmath85 , see eq .",
    "( [ fk ] ) , as a function of the ( inverse ) scattering length at _ arbitrary _ values of the pion mass .",
    "using a single input quantity such as the binding energy or the scattering length , we can then predict the phase shifts and extract the effective range @xmath16 and the shape parameters @xmath64 ( provided the effective range function does not have poles near the origin ) .",
    "some exemplary results for such predictions are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for different values of the pion mass .",
    "notice that contrary to the chiral extrapolations performed in the framework of chiral eft , no assumptions about the short - range interaction @xmath38 as a function of the pion mass is made when calculating the lets .",
    "instead , we perform fully independent calculations at each given value of the pion mass as if we lived in different worlds characterized by a specific value of @xmath14 . thus , for each considered value of the pion mass , the lec @xmath38 has to be adjusted to reproduce the given value of the scattering length used as input . by providing relations between various low - energy observables at unphysical values of the pion mass",
    ", the lets may serve as consistency checks of the lattice qcd calculations .    as already emphasized above , the extension of the lets to nlo",
    "is achieved by including subleading contact interactions parametrized via resonance saturation , see eq .",
    "( [ satur ] ) . retaining the light - quark mass variation in the subleading contact interaction",
    "is formally suppressed according to the chiral eft estimates . on the other hand , allowing for a variation of this term with @xmath14 can be used to estimate the theoretical uncertainty of our analysis . following ref .",
    "@xcite , this is achieved by adjusting the strength @xmath76 of the short - range interaction to reproduce the effective range at the physical point and by assuming that the @xmath83-dependence of @xmath76 is within the envelope built by the straight lines which go through the physical point and describe a @xmath86 change in the value of @xmath76 for @xmath87 mev , i.e. : @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "such a choice of @xmath91 is motivated by the fact that it would cover the known @xmath14-dependence of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath36 if the same procedure is applied to these quantities . in the next section",
    ", we will also give results corresponding to the more conservative choice of @xmath92 .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the lets allow one to perform consistency checks of lattice - qcd results for nn scattering provided more than a single observable is extracted .",
    "unfortunately , most of the lattice calculations in the nn sector have so far focused on the determination of the binding energies .",
    "one exception is the work by the nplqcd collaboration at the pion mass of @xmath94  mev @xcite , which provides , in addition to the binding energies , also the values of the scattering length , effective range and even the first shape parameter .",
    "it is , furthermore , conjectured in that paper that the effective range , expressed in units of the pion mass , may be approximated by a linear function of @xmath14 . while the lets are certainly beyond their range of applicability at such heavy pion masses , this conjecture was tested using the lets in our previous work @xcite , where the resulting @xmath95-dependence of the deuteron binding energy was indeed found to be in good agreement with the general trend of lattice data @xcite .",
