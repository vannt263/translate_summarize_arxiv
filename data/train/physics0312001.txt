    "<S> we investigate the ray dynamics in an optical cavity when a ray splitting mechanism is present . the cavity is a conventional two - mirror stable resonator and the ray splitting </S>",
    "<S> is achieved by inserting an optical beam splitter perpendicular to the cavity axis . </S>",
    "<S> using hamiltonian optics , we show that such a simple device presents a surprisingly rich chaotic ray dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.8truecm     pacs numbers : 42.60.da , 42.65.sf , 42.15.-i    in this letter we present a very simple optical cavity whose ray dynamics is nevertheless fully chaotic . </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is the fact that a two - mirror optical cavity can be _ stable _ or _ unstable _ depending on its geometrical configuration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if a light ray is injected inside the cavity it will remain confined indefinitely when the configuration is stable but it will escape after a finite number of bounces when the cavity is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> our interest is in a cavity which has both aspects of stability and instability ( fig [ fig:1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity is modelled as a strip resonator @xcite made of two identical concave mirrors of radius of curvature @xmath0 separated by a distance @xmath1 , where @xmath2 so that the cavity is globally stable . </S>",
    "<S> we then introduce a beam splitter ( bs ) inside the cavity , oriented perpendicular to the optical axis . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the bs defines two planar - concave subcavities : one on the left and one on the right with respect to the bs , with length @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is that depending on the position of the bs the left ( right ) subcavity becomes _ unstable _ for the reflected rays when @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is bigger than @xmath0 , while the cavity as a whole remains always _ stable _ ( @xmath5 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> consideration of this system raises the nontrivial question whether there will be an `` equilibrium '' between the number of trapped rays and escaping rays . </S>",
    "<S> the trapped rays are those which bounce for infinitely long times due to the global stability of the cavity and the escaping ones are those which stay only for a finite time . </S>",
    "<S> if such equilibrium exists it could eventually lead to transient chaos since it is known in literature that instability ( positive lyapunov exponents ) and mixing ( confinement inside the system ) form the skeleton of chaotic dynamics @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that under certain conditions such equilibrium can be achieved in our cavity and that chaotic ray dynamics is displayed + in our system the bs plays a crucial role . </S>",
    "<S> it is modelled as a stochastic ray splitting element by assuming the reflection and transmission coefficients as random variables @xcite . within the context of wave optics </S>",
    "<S> this model corresponds to the neglect of all interference phenomena inside the cavity , as required by the ray ( zero - wavelength ) limit . </S>",
    "<S> the stochasticity is implemented by using a monte carlo method to determine whether the ray is transmitted or reflected @xcite . when a ray is incident on the ray splitting surface of the bs , it is either transmitted through it , with probability @xmath6 , or reflected with probability @xmath7 , where we assume @xmath8 for a @xmath9 beam splitter as shown in fig [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we then dynamically evolve a ray and at each reflection we use a random number generator with a uniform distribution to randomly decide whether to reflect or transmit the incident ray . </S>",
    "<S> + in the context of hamiltonian optics , to characterize the trajectory of a ray we first choose a reference plane perpendicular to the optical axis @xmath10 , coinciding with the surface of the bs . </S>",
    "<S> the intersection of a ray with this plane is specified by two parameters : the height @xmath11 above the optical axis and the angle @xmath12 between the trajectory and the same axis . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the rays as point particles , as in standard billiard theory where the propagation of rays correspond to the trajectories of unit mass point particles moving freely inside the billiard and reflecting elastically at the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study the evolution of the transversal component of the momentum of the ray , i.e. @xmath13 so that we associate a ray of light with the two - dimensional vector @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that we use exact 2d - hamiltonian optics , i.e. we do _ not _ use the paraxial approximation . </S>",
    "<S> + the evolution of a set of rays injected in the cavity with different initial conditions @xmath15 , is obtained by using a ray tracing algorithm . for each initial condition , </S>",
    "<S> the actual ray trajectory is determined by a random sequence \\{ ... </S>",
    "<S> rrttrrrrt .. } which specifies if the ray is reflected ( r ) or transmitted ( t ) by the bs . </S>",
    "<S> when one evolves the whole set of initial conditions , one can choose between two possibilities , either use the _ same _ random sequence for all rays in the set of initial conditions or use a _ different _ random sequence for each ray . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we use the _ same _ random sequence for all injected rays in order to uncover the dynamical randomness of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> + the three quantities that we have calculated to demonstrate the chaotic ray dynamics inside the cavity are the poincar surface of section ( sos ) , the exit basin diagrams and the escape time function @xcite . in all calculations we have assumed @xmath16 m and the radius of curvature of the mirrors @xmath17 m ; the diameter @xmath18 of the two mirrors was @xmath19 m . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the displacement @xmath20 of the bs with respect to the center of the cavity was chosen as @xmath21 m ( unless specified otherwise ) , and the time was measured in number of bounces @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> + in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , the successive intersections of a ray with initial transverse coordinates @xmath23 m , @xmath24 are represented by the black points in the soss . for @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> the cavity configuration is symmetric and the dynamics is completely regular ( fig.[fig:2](a ) ) ; the on - axis trajectory represents an elliptic fixed point and nearby stable trajectories lie on continuous tori in phase space . in fig.[fig:2](b ) , the bs is slightly displaced from the center ( @xmath26 m ) , the same initial trajectory becomes unstable and spreads over a finite region of the phase space before escaping after a large number of bounces ( @xmath27 ) . in view of the ring structure of fig.[fig:2](b ) we may qualify the motion as azimuthally ergodic . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the ray - splitting mechanism introduced by the bs produces ergodicity is a well known result for a closed billard @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find here an analogue phenomenon , with the difference that in our case the trajectory does not explore uniformly but only azimuthally the available phase space , as an apparent consequence of the openness of the system . </S>",
    "<S> + it is well known that chaotic hamiltonian systems with more than one exit channel exhibit irregular escape dynamics which can be displayed , e.g. , by plotting the exit basin diagram @xcite . in our system , this diagram was constructed by defining a fine grid ( @xmath28 ) of initial conditions @xmath15 . each ray is followed until it escapes from the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> when it escapes from above ( @xmath29 ) we plot a black dot in the corresponding initial condition , whereas when it escapes from below ( @xmath30 ) we plot a white dot . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig.[fig:3 ] , the uniform regions in the exit basin diagram correspond to rays which display a regular dynamics , whereas the dusty regions correspond to portions of phase space where there is sensitivity to initial conditions , since two initially nearby points can escape from opposite exits . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in fig.[fig:3 ] one can see how the boundary between black and white regions becomes less and less smooth as one approaches the center of these diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that this boundary is actually a fractal set @xcite whose convoluted appearance is a typical feature of chaotic scattering systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + besides sensitivity to initial conditions , another fundamental ingredient of chaotic dynamics is the presence of infinitely long living orbits which are responsible for the mixing properties of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this set of orbits is usually called repeller @xcite , and is fundamental to generate a truly chaotic scattering system . to verify the existence of this set we have calculated the escape time or time delay function @xcite for a one - dimensional set of initial conditions specified by the initial position @xmath31 ( impact parameter ) taken on the mirror @xmath32 and the initial velocity @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the escape time was calculated in the standard way , as the time ( in number of bounces @xmath22 ) it takes a ray to escape from the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> + fig.[fig:4](a ) shows the escape time function . </S>",
    "<S> the singularities of this function are a clear signature of the existence of long living orbits and the presence of peaks followed by flat regions are a signature of the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions . in order to verify the presence of an _ infinite _ set of long living orbits , we have zoomed in on the set of impact parameters @xmath31 in three different intervals ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4](b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> each zoom reveals the existence of new infinitely long living orbits . </S>",
    "<S> infinite delay times correspond to orbits that are asymptotically close to an unstable periodic orbit . </S>",
    "<S> if we would continue to increase the resolution we would find more and more infinitely trapped orbits . </S>",
    "<S> the repeated existence of singular points is a signature of the mixing mechanism of the system due to the global stability of the cavity . + in conclusion , we have demonstrated that our simple optical system displays chaotic ray dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that a key component for the development of chaos is the inclusion of non - paraxial rays which add the mixing properties to the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it has been previously shown that paraxial ray dynamics can be unstable but not chaotic , in systems with stochastic perturbations @xcite . in our case , it is the stochastic ray splitting mechanism induced by the bs that destroys the regular motion of rays in the globally stable ( but non - paraxial ) cavity , as shown by the soss . moreover , by calculating the exit basin diagrams we have found that they show fractal boundaries , which is a typical feature of chaotic ray dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , through the singularities in the escape time function , we have verified the presence of infinitely long living orbits , which in turns reveal the mixing mechanism of our optical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> an experimental confirmation of the fractal properties of the exit basin can be performed , e.g. , in the way suggested in @xcite , by injecting a narrow laser beam into the cavity either in a regular or in a dusty region of phase space . in the former case one </S>",
    "<S> expects the beam to leave the cavity either from above or below , while in the latter case both exits should appear illuminated . </S>",
    "<S> this proposed experiment is fully within the context of geometrical optics ( interference plays no role ) so that our stochastic model of the bs is adequate . </S>",
