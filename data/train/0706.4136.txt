    "the brightness distribution of cosmological sources is conventionally used to constrain the luminosity function of the sources , their evolution in density @xcite and , for transient sources , their rate density @xcite .",
    "this method is applicable both to long - lived sources such as galaxies and to transient events such as supernovae and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "estimates are obtained by fitting the number  brightness distribution to models that include luminosity , source density and evolution effects . in the case of transient events",
    "an additional parameter is available  the event arrival times .",
    "the temporal distribution of transient astrophysical populations of events has been described by the ` probability event horizon ' ( peh ) concept of @xcite .",
    "this method establishes a temporal dependence by noting the occurrences of successively brighter events in a time series . by utilizing the fact that the rarest events will preferentially occur after the longest observational periods",
    ", it produces a data set with a unique statistical signature .    here",
    "we show that a well - defined observation - time dependence is an intrinsic feature of the source distribution of events . using swift grb data",
    "we demonstrate how this property can be used to constrain source distributions .",
    "we start by presenting an analytical derivation of the peak flux ",
    "observation time relation , @xmath2 , for sources which are uniformly distributed in euclidean space and then describe its extension to cosmological models (  [ section_derivation ] ) .",
    "we derive a simple power - law relation for @xmath2 that is invariant to the luminosity distribution of events .",
    "we then utilize the peh technique to show how @xmath2 data can be extracted from a distribution of peak fluxes (  [ section_enhancedpeh ] ) .",
    "we show that the peh method can be greatly improved by invoking time reversal invariance and the temporal cosmological principle : for time scales that are short compared to the age of the universe , a distribution of independent events is invariant with respect to temporal direction and there is nothing special about the time when we switch on our detector .    as a test",
    ", we apply the @xmath2 relation to _ swift _ long - grb data .",
    "we demonstrate that the technique can be used as a probe of the event rate density and luminosity distribution of the sources (  [ section_fittingtool ] ) , and as a tool to predict the likelihood of future high peak flux events (  [ section_predictivetool ] ) .",
    "in this paper we will define an _",
    "event _ to be an astrophysical transient occurrence with a duration much less than the period of observation .",
    "examples are grbs and gravitational wave burst sources such as coalescing compact binaries or core - collapse supernovae .",
    "consider a distribution of events defined within a euclidean space by an event rate density @xmath3 and a luminosity function , which includes a normalization constant to ensure that it integrates to unity over the range of source luminosities .",
    "this means that @xmath4 has units of inverse luminosity ",
    "see for example , @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "the observed peak flux , or ` brightness ' , distribution of events over an observation time @xmath6 is a convolution of the radial distribution of the sources and their luminosity function . for peak fluxes ( photons @xmath7 ) between @xmath8 and @xmath9 :    @xmath10    with @xmath11 .",
    "the total number of events observed in time @xmath6 with a peak flux greater than @xmath8 is given by :    @xmath12    where the average solid angle covered on the sky has been accounted for by @xmath13 .",
    "the upper limit in the integration over @xmath14 is the maximum distance for which an event with luminosity @xmath15 produces a peak flux @xmath8 .    for @xmath3 and @xmath4 independent of position",
    ", integrating over the radial distance yields :    @xmath16    this is the familiar log @xmath17log @xmath8 relation , , a power law independent of the form of the luminosity function @xcite .    to introduce the temporal distribution of events",
    ", we note that , as the events are independent of each other , the individual events will follow a poisson distribution in time .",
    "therefore , the temporal separation between events will follow an exponential distribution , defined by a mean event rate @xmath18 for events out to @xmath14 .",
    "the probability for at least one event @xmath19 to occur in a volume bounded by @xmath14 during an observation time @xmath6 at constant probability @xmath20 is given by :    @xmath21    for this equation to remain satisfied with increasing observation time :    @xmath22    equations ( [ eq_nf2 ] ) and ( [ eq_eps ] ) for @xmath23 combine to give the relation for the evolution of brightness as a function of observation time :    @xmath24^{2/3}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!t^{2/3}\\!\\hspace{0.5mm}. \\label{eq_logplogt_euc}\\\\\\ ] ]    this relation shows that for a simple euclidean geometry , a log @xmath8log @xmath6 distribution will have a slope of 2/3 , independent of the form of the luminosity function .",
    "one can consider that changes in @xmath3 create a horizontal offset in the log @xmath8log @xmath6 distribution , while changes in the integrated luminosity create a vertical offset .",
    "however , the slope is fixed by the 3-d euclidean geometry .",
    "we can use the log @xmath8log @xmath6 relation to produce curves defining the probability , @xmath20 , of obtaining some value of peak flux , @xmath8 , within an observation - time , @xmath6 , for a given @xmath3 .    for a cosmological distribution of sources , equation ( [ eq_logplogt_euc ] ) must be modified to allow for cosmic evolution .",
    "a standard friedman cosmology can be used to define a differential event rate , @xmath25 , in the redshift shell @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "the luminosity and flux will be related through @xmath26 by a luminosity distance @xmath28 ( see for example @xcite or @xcite ) . in this case , solving equation ( [ eq_eps ] ) numerically , with @xmath29 , will yield the cosmological log @xmath8log @xmath6 relation .",
    "to utilize the time domain , we use the probability event horizon ( peh ) filter of @xcite to produce @xmath2 time data .",
    "the peh filter is a tool that exploits the temporal information encoded in a time series of transient events and works by recording successively brighter events in a time series .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the unique statistical signature of events filtered in this way could be exploited to obtain rate estimates of transient events .",
    "however , the significant probability of a bright event occurring early in an observational period meant that only a small fraction of data was used by the method . as a result",
    ", large uncertainties were obtained in the estimates .",
    "there are however , two ways in which the amount of usable data can be increased .",
    "firstly , the temporal cosmological principle implies that the peh signature of a transient population of events is independent of when a detector is switched on .",
    "secondly , time reversal invariance allows the peh filter to be applied to a data set in both temporal directions .",
    "thus , a time series of events can be treated as a closed loop which can be interrogated in both directions . the observational period is now defined as the total length of the loop .",
    "the start time for the peh analysis is now arbitrary so , without loss of generality , we can choose any start time .",
    "this allows the peh filter to be applied in such a way that the brightest event can be set as the final event in a series .",
    "this ensures that the peh filter is applied to the full data stream and the process can be repeated in each direction , increasing the quantity of peh data .",
    "we refer to these techniques as ` from max ' plus ` time reversal ' ( fmtr ) .",
    "we show below how fmtr increases the peh sample and significantly improves the statistical resolution when applied to the _ swift _ data .",
    "in this section , we will apply the log @xmath8log @xmath6 relation to a cosmological population of long grbs . to account for the event rate and luminosity function",
    ", we will use estimates based on recent studies . using the fmtr method",
    ", we will extract a time - dependent sample of grb peak fluxes from the _ swift _ data , and demonstrate how it can be constrained by a log @xmath8log @xmath6 fit . + for our long - grb peak flux sample we use data recorded by the _ _ swift _ _ satellite between 2004 december and 2007 april .",
    "we consider only bursts with confirmed peak fluxes detected within the 15150 kev band of the burst alert telescope ( bat ) and with @xmath30 ( a @xmath31 duration is the interval in which a signal contains 90% of its total observed counts ) .",
    "the total sample consists of 190 peak fluxes .",
    "+ figure [ plotone]a displays the _",
    "swift _ peak flux distribution of long grbs as a time series .",
    "it is apparent that as observation time increases , there is an greater probability of a bright event . by extracting successively brighter events as a function of observation time , the peh filter samples events from the low probability tail of the distribution .",
    "the strong brightness ",
    "time dependence of these events creates a unique statistical signature which can be modeled by the log @xmath8  log @xmath6 relation .",
    "+ in table 1 we show the peh filtered data .",
    "it is apparent how the time intervals between successive events increase with observation time .",
    "this is a result of a progressive sampling of the rarer events of the distribution .",
    "+ to apply the log @xmath8log @xmath6 relation to the filtered data we must first set up a model to account for the source rate evolution and luminosity distribution .",
    "we use a model from the recent study of @xcite .",
    "they employ a ` flat-@xmath32 ' cosmological model and for the hubble parameter at the present epoch . for the isotropic luminosity function of grb peak luminosities , @xmath4",
    ", they use a broken power law form based on the work of @xcite . assuming that the rate of grbs traces the global star formation history of the universe , they employ a number of different star formation rate models . for each , they determine best fitted values for the luminosity function and event rate density . for this study , we use their model ( i ) parameters , which are based on the sf2 star formation rate model of @xcite .",
    "these parameters include fitted values for the luminosity function and a local event rate density @xmath33 . to account for the average solid angle covered on the sky by _ swift _",

    " corresponding to the @xmath35 ( top ) and @xmath36 ( bottom ) probabilities of detecting at least one event within an observation time @xmath6 .",
    "we see that the data is well constrained .",
    "the fit shows that by using only a small sample of the brightest events , it is possible to extract the geometrical signature of the source population and to test estimates of the luminosity function and rate density of events .",
    "+ the dashed lines of figure [ plotone]b show the 90% confidence band corresponding to the euclidean model using equation ( [ eq_logplogt_euc ] ) .",
    "we see that two of the first few events lie outside the euclidean curves but are constrained by the cosmological model . these events , occurring at early observation times , most likely result from sources at large cosmological distances .",
    "the very bright events at late observation times are more probable  it is apparent that the euclidean and cosmological curves begin to converge in this regime . to account for",
    "non - uniformly distributed sources , the method could be refined to take into account the spatial distribution of potential host galaxies .    to test the power - law dependence in equation ( [ eq_logplogt_euc ] ) ,",
    "we have performed least - squares fitting to the peh filtered data using the euclidean log @xmath8 log @xmath6 curve as a linear regression model . by setting the power as a single free parameter",
    ", we obtained a value of @xmath37 , confirming the 2/3 slope derived in section [ section_derivation ] .",
