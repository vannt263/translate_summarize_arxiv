    "inherent in traditional support vector detection is the assumption that the data are separable into two distinct classes , with the data points in each class being labeled distinctly , while minimizing mislabeling instances . in the case of linear support vector detection , a single hyperplane is sought , whereby the single hyperplane can be optimally shifted along its normal vector and its reflection .",
    "the shifted hyperplane and its reflection across the original , single hyperplane defines an optimal intermediate region , along with two distinctly labeled classes .",
    "assume the existence of a training set with known labels derived from a set of two distinct values .",
    "since the weight vector for the single hyperplane defines its normal vector , then the problem reduces to finding a single weight vector such that its squared norm is minimized , subject to the constraint that the individually labeled training examples lie to one side of the original hyperplane , along with others sharing the same label .",
    "after which , by combining both the squared norm term and the equation for the original hyperplane , the constrained optimization problem is converted to an unconstrained optimization problem and solved using the method of lagrange multipliers .",
    "the reader is referred to @xmath0{alpaydin}$ ] for mathematical formalities on linear support vector machines .    in case",
    "the data are not linearly separable , the aforementioned algorithm will not work , as stated .",
    "_ slack variables _ have to be introduced , which has the effect of reducing the area of the intermediate region , resulting in the constraint being modified .",
    "furthermore , in the unconstrained problem , the slack variables are taken into account by adding a penalty term as something on the order of the number of misclassifications encountered , where misclassifications take one of two forms .",
    "either some data points are counted as _ unclassified _ , because they can not be separated from the intermediate region , or they are misclassified , because they are incorrectly seen as training examples which belong to the class containing data points with a different label .",
    "the reader is referred to @xmath1{alpaydin}$ ] for mathematical formalities on non - linear support vector machines .    for data sets which are extremely large , relative to its number of attributes , mangasarian , et.al",
    ". showed in @xmath2 that a linear support vector machine suffices when separating the data into two distinct sets with small error . yet , in other kinds of problems , where the data are not linearly separable , or where a linear support vector machine gives rise to a significant number of misclassifications or an intermediate region with a high number of unclassified data points , the requirement for a non - linear support vector machine can be too expensive , both in time complexity and memory usage @xmath3 .",
    "the prevailing methods for dealing with the expense associated with solving the non - linear optimization problem are variations of the _ decomposition _ algorithm , @xmath4 , whereby the data are projected to a lower dimensional subspace , whose basis vectors are chosen such that the projected data are linearly separable . by linear separability of the data , the unconstrained , non - linear problem can be solved in the subspace via a linear support vector machine , resulting in a sequence of solvable sub - problems in each projected subspace . influenced by keerthi , et.al @xmath5 , chung , et.al .",
    "@xmath3 propose the use of specific seed values for the set of lagrange multipliers of the linear support vector machines in each subspace such that faster convergence to the solution of the non - linear optimization problem is achieved . likewise ,",
    "the _ chunking _ method of vapnik @xmath6 makes use of the fact that the rows and columns of the matrix in the quadratic constraint , which correspond to lagrange multipliers with a zero value , can be removed , while retaining the same solution through each iteration of a sub - problem .",
    "motivated to produce a method of solution which does not require iterative solutions of quadratic programs and does not require checking of certain conditions to ensure convergence to a solution , a method is provided such that the data are projected into a two dimensional space , whereby the projected data are either linearly separable or the data forms one contiguous class .",
    "when the data are separable , linear separation is achieved by forming a linear regression hyperplane through one of the classes and shifting it an appropriate amount in order to achieve separation of the classes .",
    "the associated shift corresponds to the identification of the set of support vectors by measuring distances to the regression hyperplane from data points in the set which is in the complement of the set of data points used to form the regression hyperplane .",
    "suppose infinitely many copies of a bounded structure are used to partition @xmath7 and let @xmath8 be a bounded subset containing finitely many copies of the bounded structure .",
    "further suppose that structures in the partition are neighbors , if their respective boundaries have non - empty intersection and infinitely many of the bounded structures in the partition are individually occupied by exactly one point at the center of the structure , independently of all other structures . in @xmath9 and @xmath10 ,",
    "it is shown that , if the probability of neighboring structures each containing related points is greater than some critical value , then with probability @xmath11 , a path can be traced from any starting occupied bounded structure to any ending occupied bounded structure , with the path in between the start and the end consisting entirely of neighboring occupied structures . from this statement , the contrapositive statement",
    "is obtained such that , if the probability of neighboring structures each containing related points is less than or equal to the same critical value , then with probability @xmath11 , no such path exists for any two bounded structures .",
    "hence , all points are either related to no other points or only related to finitely many points in neighboring bounded structures .",
    "it is this contrapositive condition that is of interest and great use during @xmath12-means classification , as classes are formed by groupings of inter - related data points .",
    "rarely does inter - related , real - world data conform to a predefined , rigid partition , as described above .",
    "as such , after removing the rigid partition of @xmath7 , suppose that the data are modeled by a node process which randomly generates points within @xmath13 according to some predetermined probability distribution .",
    "points in @xmath13 are inter - related , if they are within a certain distance of one another or some common point , such as the average of a set of previously - grouped , inter - related points . in @xmath14 , it is shown that , with probability @xmath11 , there is a path of inter - related points between any two points in @xmath13 , if the number of points relative to the area of @xmath13 is beyond a certain critical number or , if the maximum distance between inter - related points is larger than a certain critical number .    in @xmath15 , it is proven in cor . @xmath16 that an ordered set of data , which is assumed to be spatially uniformly distributed , will form clusters , i.e. classes , if the measured distances between data points ( or some common data point in each class ) are below a certain threshold , which is computed as a function of the number of data points sampled from the total population of data .",
    "now , most datasets would be too computationally expensive to order .",
    "so , we can get around this limitation by making certain assumptions .",
    "we can make the assumption that the node process generates points according to the normal distribution by making use of a theorem from @xmath17 in probability called the central limit theorem .",
    "in essence , this theorem states that any set of randomly distributed data with finite mean and variance will tend to be normally distributed as the sample size grows large .",
    "this accounts for the ubiquity of the normal distribution in nature and why it s safe to make an assumption of normality in most cases . as such",
    ", the node process is allowed to run until @xmath18 points are generated , as represented by a sequence of independent , identically distributed random variables , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , ... ,",
    "@xmath21 , each with mean @xmath22 and variance @xmath11 .",
    "an order statistic is applied to the these random variables so that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 for @xmath25 is a permutation resulting in the ordering of @xmath26 .",
    "note that , by default , @xmath27 is a sequence of _ dependent _ random variables since for each @xmath28 , the random variable @xmath29 depends upon @xmath30 for all @xmath31 .",
    "now , @xmath27 is a ( less computationally expensive ) ordering of a set of points generated by the node process .",
    "the edge space of the higher dimensional data is then embedded within the @xmath32-dimensional plane in order to aid in the calculation of a threshold on the distance measure .",
    "to make the assumption of uniformity of the ordered set of points and to perform clustering therein , it is first noted that the beta distribution is the probability distribution of an order statistic of normally distributed random variables @xmath33 .",
    "the beta distribution shape parameters are then defined to be , @xmath34 , since the data points are injectively generated into exactly @xmath11 structure of the uniformly partitioned , @xmath32-dimensional , bounded region .",
    "hence , the ordering of the sample can be assumed to be approximately uniform .",
    "finally , with the defined partition , it is shown that under certain conditions , no approximation of probabilities in the continuum is required to prove the existence of a path of any order , as in @xmath14 . instead , the probability of a long range path in the continuum is equivalent to the probability of a long range path , over the same set of points , in the presence of the defined posterior partition when the maximum radial distance between connected points falls within a certain bounded interval . on this",
    "bounded interval , the probability of the existence of a long range path rises sharply when points connect at distances within the bounded interval .",
    "lastly , the probability measure in question is found to be a unique random cluster measure which realizes a set of conditional probability measures . as such , the node process samples from the collection of conditional probability measures to form classes , when points connect at a distance less than or equal to the critical length .    in @xmath35 , cai , et.al .",
    "investigate the problem of partial connectivity of randomly distributed points in a bounded region by making the assumption that , relative to the size of the bounded region , the number of points to be generated is relatively small .",
    "as such , a poisson - distributed node process generates an independent set of points in the designated region .",
    "copies of a hexagon of some fixed , immutable size , which is not dependent upon distances between generated points , are used to partition the bounded region .",
    "points in the region are deemed to _ connect _ to form an _ open _",
    "edge , if after the region is partitioned , the points lie within the same hexagon or neighboring hexagons , where hexagons are _ neighbors _ , if their respective boundaries have non - empty intersection .",
    "otherwise , the edge between two points is _",
    "closed_. likewise , they define the logical points at the centers of two neighboring hexagons to _ connect _ to form an _",
    "open _ edge , if each neighboring hexagon independently contains at least one of the generated points . in @xmath35 , cai , et.al .",
    "compute probabilities as a function of the density of hexagons which are occupied by at least one point .",
    "they showed that if the number of hexagons in the fixed partition is unbounded and the number of points generated within the continuum of the bounded region is below ( or at ) a critical threshold , then the probability of a majority of the occupied hexagons ( and points contained therein ) in the bounded region being connected in a contiguous path will tend to zero . on the other hand ,",
    "if the density of occupied hexagons is within a short interval around the critical threshold , then a connecting path of hexagons or points , from any start to any end , occurs with probability that rises sharply from some small positive value to a value close to @xmath11 for densities that fall within the range of the short interval .",
    "@xmath36{goel}$ ] gives an estimate of the length of the short interval .",
    "if the area of the bounded region is assumed to be one , without loss of generality , then the estimate of the length of the short interval can never be any better than @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the number of points generated within the bounded region by the node process .",
    "this work uses the distance notion of connectivity without the presence of a partition , the same as in @xmath35 .",
    "however , it markedly differs in that the prototypical hexagon used in the defined posterior partition of the bounded region is allowed to change in size , if the node process is stopped and started again after a partition has already been defined . since the prototypical hexagon is allowed to change in size so that the logical centers are closer to ( or further away from ) each other and point density is inversely proportional to the maximum connection length , therein lies an added advantage when calculating the probability of a connected path of hexagons or points .",
    "moreover , if the prototypical hexagon always shrinks as the node process generates more points , then it should be expected that the critical threshold and the length of the short interval around the critical threshold are intertwined .",
    "it is shown that this is , in fact , the case .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in section @xmath39 , we formulate the notion of connectivity of randomly - generated data points in the continuum using random geometric graphs and prove certain continuity results of the probability measure of a class of graph properties .",
    "we use the continuity results to show the existence of a critical connectivity radius ( equivalent density of data points ) and prove that the length of the sharp threshold interval containing the critical radius is of a certain size , depending upon the number of data points and the length of the critical radius .    in section @xmath40 , we uniformly partition the bounded region into shapes of the same size and formulate the notion of connectivity of randomly - generated data points using the random cluster model . the continuity results of section @xmath39 still hold true and are used to show the existence of a critical connectivity radius , with the associated sharp threshold interval length being of a certain size , depending upon the number of data points and the length of the critical radius . in addition , relationships between the graph properties and probabilities of the graph properties are proven , along with a result about the relationship between the critical radii . these results , as well as other results from the random cluster model , are used to give a practical estimate of the length of the sharp threshold interval and a lower bound estimate of the change in the probability of the class of graph properties .",
    "finally , it is shown that under certain conditions which are best for @xmath12-means classification , the probabilities of the graph properties are equivalent and the critical radii are of the same length under both formulations .    in section",
    "@xmath41 , given a fixed , ordered sample from an unknown group of multi - modal normal distributions , we estimate the mean number of clusters to form in a typical @xmath12-means classification .",
    "likewise , we also estimate the length of the sharp threshold interval as a function of the expected number of classes and an estimate of the size of the critical connectivity radius is given as a function of the number of data points in the sample and the expected number of classes to form .    in section @xmath42 , using the setup and results from section @xmath41 , we define the regularized cluster and the set of anomalies , then prove that the regularized cluster and the set of anomalies are linearly separable and show that the linear regression hyperplane defined by the regularized cluster can be shifted by a certain distance along its normal vector to separate the regularized cluster from the set of anomalies .    finally , in section @xmath43",
    ", we show that the set of anomalies is a superset for the set of support vectors defining the shifted hyperplane which delineates the maximally separating region between the binary classes and that the resulting neural network detects all of the support vectors .",

    "<S> we use random geometric graphs to describe clusters of higher dimensional data points which are bijectively mapped to a ( possibly ) lower dimensional space where an equivalent random cluster model is used to calculate the expected number of modes to be found when separating the data of a multi - modal data set into distinct clusters . furthermore , as a function of the expected number of modes and the number of data points in the sample , an upper bound on a given distance measure is found such that data points have the greatest correlation if their mutual distances from a common center is less than or equal to the calculated bound . </S>",
    "<S> anomalies are exposed , which lie outside of the union of all regularized clusters of data points .    </S>",
    "<S> similar to finding a hyperplane which can be shifted along its normal to expose the maximal distance between binary classes , it is shown that the union of regularized clusters can be used to define a hyperplane which can be shifted by a certain amount to separate the data into binary classes and that the shifted hyperplane defines the activation function for a two - class discriminating neural network . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , this neural network is used to detect the set of support vectors which determines the maximally - separating region between the binary classes . </S>"
