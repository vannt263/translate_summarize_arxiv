    "the inspiral of a compact object ( co ) into a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) is an exciting potential source for lisa @xcite",
    ". the extreme mass ratio of these systems ensures that the co acts as a probe of the gravitational potential of the smbh . for the last several years before plunge",
    ", the orbit remains close to the smbh and the emitted gravitational radiation effectively maps out this strong field region of the spacetime @xcite . if the central object is really a kerr black hole , extreme relativistic perihelion and lense - thirring precessions are evident in the zoom and whirl waveforms @xcite .",
    "these complex features allow measurement of the mass and spin of the smbh to unprecedented precision @xcite . if the central object is something other than a black hole , for instance a massive boson star , the difference may be evident in the gravitational waves .",
    "extreme mass ratio inspiral ( emri ) waveforms thus provide a strong field test of gr and black hole physics .",
    "methods are presently being developed to detect and characterize deviations from the kerr predictions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but here we will focus on detection of emris into kerr black holes .    the desire for lisa to detect a significant number of emris during the mission has been driving the final lisa mission specification .",
    "a typical expected emri source will be buried in the detector noise .",
    "these signals can be extracted using matched filtering , but the total number of detections will depend on the frequency range and level of the lisa noise floor . we describe here a first cut effort to estimate the lisa detection rate , assuming a plausible data analysis technique that employs realistic computational resources .",
    "these preliminary results indicate that with its baseline design lisa should see about a thousand emri events during its lifetime .",
    "there appears to be no pressing need to modify the satellite design in order to enhance the emri event rate .",
    "more details of this work can be found in a white paper prepared for the list ( lisa international science team ) @xcite .    in section  [ astro ]",
    "we describe some astrophysical aspects of emris , including the source parameters of a typical event and an estimate of the capture event rate . in section",
    "[ detect ] we outline a plausible detection scheme and then in section  [ rate ] we estimate the number of events that lisa would see using this scheme , given the astrophysical rate estimate .",
    "we finish in section  [ discuss ] with a brief discussion of these results and outline some of the remaining uncertainties .",
    "emris occur as a consequence of large angle scattering encounters between objects in the cusp of stars surrounding a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the center of a galaxy .",
    "such encounters may put a star onto an orbit that passes sufficiently close to the central black hole that gravitational radiation dominates the subsequent evolution and it becomes bound to the smbh .",
    "the stellar orbit decays over time , due to the loss of energy and angular momentum in bursts of gravitational radiation emitted near periapse .",
    "initially these bursts are widely separated in time and the radiation will not be detectable , but in the last few years of inspiral the source will be radiating continuously at frequencies to which lisa is sensitive .",
    "the typical frequency of the gravitational radiation is determined by the mass of the primary , @xmath1 .",
    "the floor of the lisa noise curve ( @xmath2 ) therefore sets the mass range to which we are most sensitive at @xmath3 .",
    "lisa could detect nearby sources with other primary masses , but we concentrate on this mass range since it should dominate the event rate .",
    "the secondary has to be a compact body to avoid tidal disruption before plunge , so we consider white dwarfs ( @xmath4 ) , neutron stars ( @xmath5 ) and both stellar mass ( @xmath6 ) and intermediate mass black holes ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the spin of the primary can take any value in the range @xmath8 , with spins around @xmath9 probably being typical , since this is approximately the point of spin equilibrium in black hole accretion models @xcite .",
    "emri orbits are generally moderately eccentric at plunge , @xmath10 depending on the periapse at capture , and can have any initial inclination to the black hole spin axis .",
    "the orbital periapse can take any value between the plunge periapse at a few @xmath1 and the capture periapse at @xmath11 s of @xmath1 , but we restrict this range by only searching for inspirals that are in the last few years before plunge .",
    "there are two ingredients that go into an estimate of the frequency with which emris occur in the universe .",
    "the first is an estimate of the space density of supermassive black holes in the appropriate mass range , and the second is an estimate of the rate at which each black hole is consuming compact objects .",
    "the space density of smbhs is constrained observationally , with the tightest measurement of black hole mass , @xmath12 , coming from the correlation with spheroid velocity dispersion , @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants .",
    "we use @xmath18 and constrain @xmath15 and @xmath16 from observations .",
    "merritt and ferrarese @xcite find @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "tremaine @xcite find @xmath21 and @xmath22 , but use a nonstandard definition of dispersion .",
    "the galaxy velocity dispersion function may be constrained indirectly using galaxy luminosity functions and the @xmath23 correlation @xcite . in conjunction with the @xmath24 relation ( [ msigma ] ) , this leads to a black hole mass function of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the gamma function and @xmath28 is a constant equal to the total number density of galaxies .",
    "aller and richstone @xcite use the value @xmath21 from tremaine @xcite to set @xmath29 and constrain the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath16 and @xmath30 according to galaxy type .",
    "these values are listed in table  [ bhdistparams ] . for the mass range of interest in this analysis , @xmath31 ,",
    "the total aller and richstone space density of black holes is approximately @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the hubble parameter .",
    "some sc@xmath34sd galaxies have central black hole masses much lower than would be derived from their luminosities @xcite .",
    "if we remove these from the sample , the black hole space density is reduced by a factor of two .",
    "we adopt this lowered value as the reference density for estimating the capture rate . in an interval @xmath35 , the total space density of black holes is then @xmath36 .    to estimate the rate at which each smbh is capturing compact objects , we make use of marc freitag s simulation of the milky way @xcite . that simulation used @xmath37 and @xmath38 and",
    "predicts present day capture rates of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 white dwarfs , @xmath42 neutron stars and @xmath43 black holes respectively .",
    "freitag does not simulate intermediate mass black hole remnants , but madau and rees @xcite estimate a dynamical friction rate of @xmath44 in the milky way for these objects .",
    "we assume optimistically that half of these are captured by gravitational radiation ( the others being direct plunges ) and use a capture rate of @xmath45 . to extrapolate from these results to other central black hole masses we note that since these bodies are captured by large angle scattering @xcite , the rate of gravitational capture is comparable to the rate of direct plunges and each is approximately half of the dynamical friction rate . for stars with mass @xmath46 much greater than the mean , the dynamical friction timescale is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the local stellar density , @xmath13 is the spheroid velocity dispersion and @xmath49 measures the range of impact parameters for stellar encounters in the cluster @xcite .",
    "galaxies with smbhs in the mass range to which lisa is sensitive tend to have isothermal density profiles in the core , @xmath50 .",
    "substituting this profile and the relation ( [ msigma ] ) with @xmath51 into equation ( [ tdf ] ) , we deduce , for each stellar component @xmath46 , the radius , @xmath52 , within which @xmath53 , as a function of time @xmath54 . assuming the cluster has an age @xmath55 and",
    "all the stars within @xmath52 have sunk to the center , we find that the total mass in such stars scales as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the fraction of the total stellar mass in that component and @xmath58 . taking the mass in gravitational captures to be half this , we estimate the extreme mass ratio capture rate in a galaxy today to be @xmath59 where we again used @xmath60y . using a kroupa imf and standard initial - final mass relations , the mass fraction @xmath61 for @xmath62 white dwarfs , @xmath63 for @xmath64 black holes and @xmath65 for @xmath66 pop iii black holes .",
    "taking @xmath67 , the rates predicted by equation ( [ captrate ] ) agree with freitag s simulation for @xmath64 black holes and within a factor of two of the madau and rees estimate for @xmath68 black holes .",
    "( [ captrate ] ) over predicts freitag s white dwarf rate by a factor of four , but the previous assumptions are not valid for white dwarfs since the capture time is longer than the hubble time and mass segregation discriminates against these low mass stars .",
    "however , the @xmath69 scaling with black hole mass should be fairly good for all stellar components and we use this to scale freitag s rates for the milky way to other galaxy masses . combining this with the black hole space density",
    ", we estimate the rate of mergers today for three ranges of smbh mass , and four types of compact object capture .",
    "these rates are summarized in table  [ ratetab ] .",
    "there are uncertainties in both the space density of black holes and the capture rate .",
    "the distribution of galaxy velocity dispersions can be constrained by direct observation , rather than using the indirect correlation with luminosity employed here .",
    "sheth @xcite use sdss data to measure velocity dispersions , and find the total smbh space density in our range of interest to be an order of magnitude lower",
    ". however , the sdss spectra do not have sufficient resolution to measure the dispersion in this black hole mass range , so this extrapolation should not be trusted .",
    "hils and bender @xcite estimate the white dwarf capture rate to be a factor of @xmath70 smaller than our extrapolation from freitag , but they assume an adiabatic central density profile and only half the number of white dwarfs that modern imfs predict .",
    "sigurdsson and rees @xcite predict a rate that is a factor of @xmath71 lower than freitag s , but their central cusps were not fully self - consistent and they ignored mass segregation . in more recent simulations ,",
    "freitag @xcite uses a new model and also finds capture rates for all species that are an order of magnitude lower .",
    "the new model uses a different imf and cluster model and contains a fixed mass central smbh while the old model grew the smbh adiabatically from a tiny seed .",
    "we use the old results because they are consistent with the expression ( [ captrate ] ) used to extrapolate to other central smbh masses , but must allow for these uncertainties .",
    "a conservative rate for the white dwarfs would be @xmath72 of those in table  [ ratetab ] .",
    "the black hole rates are more robust to stellar dynamics , but depend on the mass fraction of stellar mass black holes . while the increasing number of observed galactic black hole binaries give some confidence that this mass fraction is not too different from our assumptions , we should allow an order of magnitude or more uncertainty in the black hole rates .",
    ".parameters for black hole space densities in equation ( [ bhdist ] ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the estimates in table  [ lisarate ] indicate that even under the pessimistic assumptions , lisa should detect over a thousand emri events during its lifetime and there seems to be no particular advantage to using a shorter arm length .",
    "the biggest remaining uncertainty is in the astrophysical rates ( table  [ ratetab ] ) .",
    "using more conservative estimates , the detection of white dwarf inspirals becomes marginal , but the stellar mass black hole signals are still robust .",
    "the uncertainty arising from the use of kludged waveforms may be quantified by comparing to perturbative waveforms @xcite .",
    "the template counts appear quite robust and the snrs are not bad .",
    "we have compared snrs computed from kludged waveforms to snrs computed using the quadrupole piece of an adiabatic sequence of perturbative waveforms in the simplest case of circular equatorial inspiral . for such inspirals , the last year snrs agree within @xmath73 for all spins , but the kludge snrs are larger .",
    "this could lead to a factor @xmath74 overestimate of the detection rates .",
    "however , including all multipoles , the total snrs of the perturbative waveforms are larger than those of the pure quadrupole kludge waveforms , since the higher multipoles are generally at frequencies more accessible to lisa . a modified search",
    "therefore might recover these events .",
    "this effect is expected to be even stronger for eccentric orbits although the uncertainty in the rates should still only be a factor of a few , but perturbative eccentric inspiral waveforms were not available for comparison .",
    "an issue that has not yet been properly addressed is self - confusion  there is a background of gravitational radiation from all the unresolved emris in the universe from which the louder signals must be extracted .",
    "this is an additional noise source which is now being estimated .",
    "we have also assumed that it is possible to remove the resolved white dwarf binaries from the lisa data stream before performing the emri search .",
    "methods like gclean in principle will remove the emri signals as well as the white dwarf binaries .",
    "it may therefore be necessary to do the searches for emris and binaries simultaneously , which would change the computational requirements .",
    "the approach to emri data analysis outlined here is a first cut . under this scheme",
    "a source requires a snr @xmath75 to be detected .",
    "if we had infinite computational power and could perform a fully coherent search , the detection snr would still be @xmath76 , for the same false alarm probability .",
    "we therefore lose about a factor of two in reach by using a hierarchical search . with a more careful division into coherent segments or a different incoherent summation",
    ", we may recover some of these lost events .",
    "the fact that even this first cut scheme predicts a thousand inspiral detections suggests that lisa will detect many emri events despite the remaining uncertainties .",
    "this work would not have been possible without the guidance and encouragement of kip thorne , who repeatedly cracked the whip to make sure the project stayed on schedule .",
    "we also thank kostas glampedakis , scott hughes and daniel kennefick for the use of their kludge waveform code and for many useful discussions at emri telecons .",
