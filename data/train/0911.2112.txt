    "with the advent of interferometry and adaptive optics techniques in the infrared ( ir ) in large ground - based telescopes , the central regions of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are being studied in ever - increasing detail .",
    "the best details have so far been seen on the brightest and nearest agn observed with the very large telescope ( vlt ) . here is a list .",
    "the nucleus of ngc 1068 is resolved into a parsec - scale disc in near - ir ( weigelt et al .",
    "2004 ) and mid - ir ( jaffe et al .  2004 ) interferometry observations . that of circinus is also resolved into a parsec - scale disc - like structure perpendicular to the ionization cone in adaptive optics images in the near ir ( prieto et al .",

    "the nucleus of cen a , however , is so far unresolved down to scales of less than a parsec in adaptive optics images in the near ir ( haring - neumayer et al .",
    "2006 ) and interferometry in the mid - ir ( meisenheimer et al .  2007 ) .",
    "other bright agn observed with adaptive optics in the near ir show an unresolved nucleus , so far , down to scales of tens of parsecs ( prieto et al .",
    "2007 ) , and from those that could be targeted with interferometry in the mid - ir , the available data indicate a resolved nuclear structure , @xmath1 pc in size , and ngc 4151 , and possible resolved emission in ngc 1365 , ngc 3783 and ngc 7469 ( tristram et al . 2009 )",
    ". the torus structure may be larger than a few parsecs at mid - ir wavelengths , where dust heated by the agn to blackbody equivalent temperatures of 100300 k may exist at larger radii .",
    "one of the problems is that this outermost region may be fully resolved with interferometry and thus will escape detection .",
    "this work presents difraction - limited vlt observations at 11.8 @xmath0 m and 18.7 @xmath0 m of a sample of the nearest and brigthest agn accessible from paranal observatory .",
    "the resolutions achieved are a factor 10 lower than those provided by vlt - midi interferometry , but are more sensitive to possible extended structures around the nucleus ( e.g. perlman et al . 2001 ; siebenmorgen et al .",
    "2008 ) ; at the very least , they allow for setting an upper limit to the outer radius of the torus . at the higher resolution achieved in these observations ( fwhm = 0.3 arcsecs )",
    "this upper - limit radius in the sample galaxies is 35 pc on average ( ranging from 5 to 130 pc ) .",
    "this paper is part of an major project focusing on the study of the central few parsecs of the nearest agn at optical , ir and radio wavelengths , using the highest spatial resolution data available today .",

    "for all these objects vlt subarcsec resolution observations , by means of adaptive optics in the 1 to 5 @xmath0 m range @xcite , and at 11.9 and 18.7 @xmath0 m ( this work ) were collected .",

    "the complete visir field of view at 18.7 @xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "3 ) is one of the deepest images of the starforming ring and nucleus of this galaxy at this wavelength , presenting more than 12 starforming knots in the ring .",
    "the visir 11.8 @xmath0 m image is worse in quality , due to a high background residual , and only three regions of the ring are detected .",
    "more star forming regions at this wavelength are detected by @xcite using gemini / t - recs .",
    "the nuclear fluxes reported by @xcite in a 1.5 arcsec aperture radius are larger by a factor 2 at 11 @xmath0 m and a factor 1.5 at 18 @xmath0 m than those found by us , either after integrating in an aperture containing all the observed emission or from the radial profile analysis ( table 3 ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is not clear .",
    "et al filters are much broader than the ones used by us ( their filters are 18.3 @xmath0 m filter with half bandwidth = 1.51 @xmath0 m and 11.7 @xmath0 m filter with 1.13 @xmath0 m half bandwidth ) . accordingly",
    ", their 11.7 @xmath0 m may include the contribution of the usually strong 11.2 @xmath0 m pah feature .",
    "however , the results from ir nuclear spectroscopy carried by the same authors indicate the absence of other pah features in the nucleus of ngc 1097 .",
    "thus , the plausible explanation for the difference is genuine nuclear variability , by a factor of 2 or so in a time scale of 1 year , the spanning time between both observation sets .    comparing with large aperture _ iras _ ( table 1 ) or _ spitzer _ ( 6.6 jy at 24 @xmath0 m ; @xcite ) fluxes",
    ", they are two orders of magnitudes larger than the nuclear fluxes reported here . in this case , the ir satellite fluxes are dominated by the prominent star - forming ring of ngc  1097 .",
    "the observed 18.7 @xmath0 m flux in the ring is @xmath14 500  mjy ( no reliable estimate is possible at 11.8 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "this is a lower limit due to the observational limitation of chopping ; also the full extension of the ring is not included within the visir field of view .",
    "still this lower limit is already an order of magnitude higher than that of the agn , indicating that at mid - ir wavelengths star formation and not the agn is the dominant contributor .",
    "this is full in line with the result derived from the analysis of the spectral energy distribution of this nucleus based on very high resolution data , from uv to optical to ir .",
    "this study shows that the genuine agn luminosity in ngc 1097 is indeed a tiny fraction , less than 1% , of the total ir luminosity integrated over the galaxy @xcite .",
    "ngc 1386 is an inclined , barred lenticular galaxy with a seyfert 2 nucleus .",
    "the nuclear region is crossed by dust lanes , which are preferentially distributed along the galaxy major axis at pa@xmath1020 .",
    "the 5007  emission is highly collimated and extends along the same direction , north - to - south , up to @xmath103 arcsec radius from the center ( schmitt et al .",
    "2003 ; fig .",
    "2 ) .    both 11.8 and 18.7 @xmath0 m visir images also show elongation along the north  south direction but up to @xmath101 arcsec from the centre ( fig.[fig1097_1386 ] ) .",
    "although the elongation is in the direction of telescope chopping and could be caused by this , we tend to believe that it is real as it is present at both wavelengths , covering a similar size",
    ". none of the psf star observations in either band show similar structure ( see table 2 ) . also , the symmetric double - lobe residual seen after subtracting the psf ( fig .",
    "2 ) remains the same even if the psf is rotated by 90 degrees .",
    "south is a preferential emission direction in this galaxy we consider the extension to be genuine .",
    "the radial profiles at both wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ fig1097_1386 ] ) are similar , presenting excess emission up to even larger distances of 1.52.0 arcsec .",
    "figure [ res_1386_n ] shows a residual image at 11.8 @xmath0 m after scaling the psf star to 75% of the galaxy peak .",
    "the scale factor is chosen to minimize negative fluxes seen when scaling to 100 % of the peak ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the resulting morphology is now smoother and continuous , in line with that seen in the line emission .",
    "m emission of ngc 1386 with the psf scaled to 75% of the peak flux of the nucleus and subtracted .",
    "the contours are placed at logarithmic intervals at 1.5 , 3 , 6 , 12 and 24@xmath6.[res_1386_n],height=302 ]    the total integrated flux at 11.8 @xmath0 m is 15% difference from that reported by @xcite using eso-3.6 m / timmi2 with a much broader filter centered at 11.9 @xmath0 m ( fwhm = 2.26 @xmath0 m ) . since this filter includes the strong pah feature at 11.2 @xmath0 m , the flux difference can partially be attributed to this contribution and the photometry errors .",
    "the results from the profile fitting analysis further indicate that the contribution of the unresolved source ( the agn ) is @xmath1050% of the total measured at each of the wavelengths , with the other half being associated with the north - south extended emission . comparing with the large aperture _ iras _ data , the inferred agn contribution is again much less , @xmath1040% of the _ iras _",
    "12 @xmath0 m and @xmath15 of the _ iras _ 25 @xmath0 m flux levels .",
    "it can be readily seen that the difference with the iras 12 @xmath0 m flux is the contribution of the extended nuclear emission seen by visir .",
    "this is not the case at 25 @xmath0 m , and thus most of the emission at this wavelength must come , plausibly , from a more diffuse extended emission over the galaxy .",
    "ngc  1566 is a face - on spiral galaxy with a seyfert 1 nucleus .",

    "the _ [ iras _ 12 @xmath0 m and isocam 8.510.7 @xmath0 m fluxes @xcite are larger , by factors of 13 and 4 respectively , than the 11.8 @xmath0 m nuclear flux reported here .",
    "the _ iras _",
    "25 @xmath0 m flux is a factor 10 higher than the 18.7 @xmath0 m flux .",
    "the smaller difference with ramos et al .",
    "is because of the deconvolution procedure applied to the isocam radial light profile , which helps reducing the galaxy contribution , but obviously is insufficient to overcome the poor iso spatial resolution .",
    "thus , most of the emission measured in this object in ir large aperture data is dominated form other sources in the galaxy , and the agn contribution to the total is minor .",
    "the analysis of the sed of this nucleus based on very high resolution data from uv to optical to ir shows that indeed that is the case : the intrinsic agn luminosity is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the galaxy @xcite .",

    "visir 11.8 and 18.7 @xmath0 m images are also dominated by an unresolved central source with no extended emission detected in either the residuals or the radial profile analysis ( fig.[fig_1239_3783 ] ) .",

    "( 2007 ) , using also visir but a narrow - band filter just centered on the pah feature at 11.2 @xmath0 m ( fwhm = 0.6@xmath0 m ) .",
    "thus , the higher flux measured by haas et al . may be due to pah contribution - the photometric errors in both observations are about 10 % .",
    "if that is the case , some level of starformation may be present at the nuclear region at scales of less than 70  pc - the resolution of these observations .",
    "alternatively , the difference may be due to variability at very low level : these observations and that of haas et al are separated by one year .    comparing with",
    "the _ iras _ flux levels at 12 and 25 @xmath0 m , the visir nuclear fluxes are @xmath1060% lower in either band .",
    "this is a small difference as compared with most of the objects in this sample , emphasising the dominance of this agn over the host galaxy light .",
    "the analysis of the spectral energy distribution of this nucleus on the basis of high spatial resolution data shows indeed that this agn behaves like a quasar dominating the integrated light at any aperture size in the 1 to 100 @xmath0 m range ( prieto et al .",

    "m87 is a giant elliptical galaxy with a liner - type nucleus .",
    "it has a one - sided jet at pa @xmath19 extending up to 2 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "the radio , optical , and x - ray jet has several knots of which the innermost one  hst-1 at 0.85 arcsec from the nucleus  has brightened fifty - fold in the x - rays in the period 20002005 @xcite .",
    "a sudden increase in brightness from hst-1 has also been seen in the ir in our vlt / naco @xmath20-band images during the same period , reaching flux levels comparable to that of the nucleus .",
    "m87 was observed in 2006 with visir . at that time , only the nucleus was bright at 11.8 @xmath0 m ( fig .",

    "a deeper gemini image by perlman et al ( 2001 ) , using a broad - band filter centered at 10.8 @xmath0 m ( fwhm= 5.3 @xmath0 m ) shows additional jet components at larger distances .",
    "they report on marginal nuclear excess emission up to @xmath22 arcsec from the centre .",
    "the visir image has slightly better spatial resolution than that by gemini ( 0.32 vs. 0.46 arcsec ) and so far our results on the residual image and radial profile analysis are consistent with the nucleus of m87 being point - like .",

    "the resulting flux at 11.8 @xmath0 m is virtually the same as that reported by @xcite .",

    "the mid - ir filters used in this work , narrow and centred on windows where emission lines or pah features are unimportant , are thus targeted to measure pure continuum emission .",

    ". moreover , the size of the extended mid - ir emission closely coincides with the observed sizes of the fe or si coronal region ( rodriguez - ardila et al . ) and with their spatial location , which indicates that a fraction of the mid - ir emission is due to free  free emission from predominantly shock - heated coronal gas . estimating this contribution requires detailed modelling and is currently being explored .",
    "mid- and far - ir emission of galaxies is usually derived from large - aperture data obtained by ir satellites . for galaxies with an agn , it is widely assumed that most of this emission comes from the nucleus .",
    "the flux level of the nuclear point source in the agn studied in this work proves the assumption to be inadequate in most cases .",
    "the estimated 11.8 and 18.7 @xmath0 m nuclear fluxes are larger , by factors of @xmath37 , than the fluxes measured by _ iras _ at 12 and 25 @xmath0 m in 70% of the sample , the largest discrepancy being more than an order of magnitude in five galaxies : ngc 1097 , ngc 1566 , m87 , cen a and ngc 7582 ( in the latter case only at 18.7 @xmath0 m ) . in the remaining 30% of the sample , the _ iras _ flux levels are still larger but within a factor of 2 .",
    "the `` extra '' ir excess measured by _",
    "iras _ has to come from a source other than the agn , either strong ir sources , presumably located outside the central 20 arcsec @xmath12 20 arcsec region  common f.o.v .  in ground - based mid - ir observations  or from a more extended low surface brightness component across the galaxy . for example , in the three agn with circumnuclear star - forming regions , the total integrated emission ( agn plus star - forming ring ) accounts for the iras flux levels within a factor of 2 .",
    "this is the case of ngc 7582 and ngc 7469 ; in ngc 1097 , the difference is still a factor 10 , but in this case the visir f.o.v .",
    "does not map the complete extension of the ring . in all other agn with",
    "detected nuclear extended emission , this contribution is minor , albeit a lower limit because of the lower sensitivity imposed by chopped observations .",
    "the overall conclusion based on this small sample is that in agn with strong circumnuclear star formation , this component can well account for most of the iras flux . for all other cases , either a low surface brightness component extending over galactic scales or strong extranuclear ir sources  e.g. regions in spiral arms  are the major contribution to the ir light of these galaxies . in either case ,",
