    "detectors comprised of scintillating fibres that are packed together to form arrays and read out via multi - channel photo - detectors have been in use since the 1990s to track charged particles , e.g.  @xcite .    at the institut fr kernphysik in mainz , germany ,",
    "the microtron mami has been upgraded to 1.5gev electron beam energy and can now be used to study strange hadronic systems . during the last years",
    "the spectrometer was installed with large angular acceptance under forward angles at the existing spectrometer facility for strangeness reaction spectroscopy .",
    "a large fibre detector set - up is under development for the spectrometer  @xcite : the coordinate detector of the spectrometer s electron arm will consist of two vertical planes of fibre arrays , covering an active area of @xmath71600 @xmath8 300mm@xmath9 , supplemented by one or more horizontal planes .",
    "the hyphi project is dedicated to hypernuclear spectroscopy with stable heavy ion beams and rare isotope beams at gsi , germany , and fair , the facility for antiproton and ion research  @xcite .",
    "one of the central parts of the hyphi experiment is a scintillating fibre detector for the measurement of decay vertices of hypernuclei and for the tracking of charged particles directly behind the target .",
    "the fibre detector will also become crucial in distinguishing the hypernuclei @xmath10h and @xmath11h from the background containing @xmath12 and @xmath13 particles produced at the target .",
    "this detector is currently under development  @xcite .    in this",
    "paper results from beam - tests of scintillating fibre detectors are discussed .",
    "section  2 describes the detectors and the read - out electronics . in section",
    "3 a resume of an investigation with electrons tracked through a large magnetic spectrometer at mami is given .",
    "the following sections  3 and 4 show the results on position , time and energy resolutions obtained with primary @xmath0c beams and a beam of several particle species at gsi .",
    "section  5 closes with the future prospects of using this kind of fibre detectors and electronics with the spectrometer at mami and within the hyphi project at gsi .",
    "the fibres are of the standard ( non - s ) type scsf-78 ( kuraray , japan ) with double cladding and @xmath14 0.83 mm outer diameter .",
    "the cladding thickness is @xmath15 mm , leading to a 0.73 mm thick core made of a polystyrene base with refractive index @xmath16 1.6 .",
    "the outer cladding is made of a fluorinated polymer with refractive index @xmath17 1.42 and the inner cladding is made of polymethylmethacrylate with refractive index @xmath18 1.49 .",
    "the emission spectrum extends from @xmath19 415550 nm with a maximum at @xmath19 440 nm for fibres of short lengths . for a double cladding fibre",
    "the critical axial angle is given by @xmath20 .",
    "the trapping efficiency for photons produced close to the axis of the fibre is @xmath21 giving @xmath22 more light than single cladding fibres , where the efficiency for light trapped inside the core is only @xmath23 .",
    "the fibre arrays consisted of 4 double layers .",
    "a fibre column was formed by 4 fibres , one from each double layer , coupled to one common read - out channel of the photo - detector by a small plastic cookie with a matrix of holes .",
    "these columns were aligned along the incident particle direction .",
    "the read - out was one - sided by multi - anode photomultipliers ( mapmts ) .",
    "no optical grease was used between fibres and the entrance window .",
    "the mapmts of type r7259k ( hamamatsu photonics , japan ) are fitted with a 32-channel linear array of metal electrodes .",
    "the photocathode material is bialkali and the window is made of 1.5 mm thick borosilicate glass .",
    "the effective area per channel is @xmath24mm@xmath9 with a pitch of 1 mm .",
    "a complication arises from the fact , that the numerical aperture for the multi - cladding fibre is 0.72 , so that the light cone at the photo - cathode has a diameter of 2.32 mm .",
    "this results in a hit multiplicity of typical 3 neighbouring channels .",
    "the mapmts have been characterised with an average anode luminous sensitivity of @xmath25a@xmath26lm ( according to data sheet 140a@xmath26lm is typical ) , an average cathode luminous sensitivity @xmath27a@xmath26lm ( 70@xmath28a@xmath26lm typical ) , and an average gain @xmath29 ( @xmath30 typical ) .",
    "the gain uniformity between anodes was found to be between 1:1.1 and 1:1.25 ( 1:1.5 typical ) , with the edge anodes having slightly lower gains on average .",
    "hardly any strip has less than 70% of the maximum gain of a given photomultiplier",
    ".    instead of supplying dynode voltages through a voltage divider the mapmts were powered by individual cockcroft - walton bases ( hvsys , russia ) .",
    "the dc voltage is pulsed and converted with a ladder network of capacitors and diodes to higher voltages .",
    "stiff high voltage cables are not needed , since only @xmath2140v has to be delivered to the first front - end board , where the voltage is daisy - chained to the other boards of the detector plane .    for the construction of the fibre bundles position matrices",
    "were designed , allowing for the mounting and the alignment of the fibres with the desired pitch .",
    "the construction procedure for the fibre bundles was to glue single layers of 16 fibres into grooved aluminium plates with acrylic white paint .",
    "a total of 8 single layers is needed for each bundle .",
    "these bundles were then glued into the cookies .",
    "the bundles were polished using a diamond cutting tool ( mutronic , germany ) .",
    "two of the three bundles had to be bent .",
    "this was done by placing them into an oven at a temperature of 70@xmath31c for about 1hour and bending them into the desired shape .",
    "as half of the scintillation light is emitted in the direction opposite to the photomultiplier , light reflected by the end face can contribute significantly to the total light output . in order to increase the light yield , some of the fibre bundles used in the tests were aluminised at the polished free end face for a high reflectivity .",
    "a vaporisation chamber was utilised that consisted of a vacuum chamber with an electric oven in which a small pellet can be placed .",
    "the aluminium coating adhered firmly and smoothly to the end face of the bundle .",
    "the increase of light yield was confirmed with a @xmath32sr source in laboratory measurements and amounted to @xmath2 50% .",
    "the beam - tests at mami were performed with a fibre detector positioned near the focal plane of a large magnetic spectrometer where scattered electrons have an inclination of 45@xmath31 with respect to the normal to the detection plane . if the particles were crossing the fibre array with an angle to the column direction its tracking capability would be compromised .",
    "accordingly , two bundles of 4 double layers with the fibre columns following the 45@xmath31 inclination in square packing geometry were built .",
    "the fibre array has an overlap of @xmath33 0.24 mm , and a column pitch of @xmath34 0.59 mm , see fig .",
    "[ fig:45deg ] .",
    "our experience shows that the best way to stack the fibres during the actual assembly is layer - by - layer .",
    "other sequences may cause sizeable misalignments which directly lead to errors in the position determination .",
    "for the tests in the carbon beam 3 bundles of 128 fibres each with an active area of @xmath35mm@xmath9 were constructed in a square packing geometry of 4 double layers , see fig .",
    "[ fig:0deg ] .",
    "overlap and column pitch of this geometry are identical to the 45@xmath31 geometry .",
    "results from for laboratory measurements with a @xmath32sr source resulted in a light yield of 45 photoelectrons per pixel with a multiplicity of 3 pixels , corresponding to 15 photoelectrons per crossing minimum ionising particle .    in the spectrometer",
    ", particles will cross the electron arm focal plane with an inclination angle of @xmath36 with respect to the normal of the plane . regarding this geometry fibre arrays with a hexagonal packing of slanted columns with 60@xmath31 inclination",
    "were constructed , see fig .",
    "[ fig:60deg ] .",
    "overlap and column pitch of this geometry are 0.41 mm .",
    "these detectors were tested in the beams at gsi .",
    "a 12-layer front - end board able to accommodate the three mapmts was developed by the institut fr kernphysik for this type of fibre detector .",
    "it supplies the voltage for the cockcroft - walton voltage multipliers and brings the analogue signals along equalised conducting paths to the rj-45 connectors for the output to the discriminators . for amplitude - compensated timing two 32-channel discriminator boards , custom designed and built by the the institut fr kernphysik ,",
    "each with 4 integrated low - walk double threshold discriminators ( dtds ) , were used .",
    "the dtd boards were placed in an 6u crate together with a controller board . the communication with a pc",
    "was done via parallel port .",
    "the time is picked off by catch cards , developed for the compass collaboration  @xcite . at gsi analogue output boards with 50@xmath37 coaxial connectors were attached to the discriminator boards to access also the pulse heights of each channel .",
    "the pulse height information of 22 channels was read out by two model 2249a camac adcs ( lecroy , us ) .",
    "the adcs offer a resolution of 10bits at an input sensitivity of 0.25pc@xmath26count .",
    "the trigger was either derived from the second plane of the fibre detector or from a reference counter , a scintillation paddle that was installed 2 m upstream in the beam - line .",
    "the time difference between individual channels and the reference counter showed a dependence on the pulse height . this time",
    "walk effect was corrected according to the equation @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a global correction coefficient and @xmath40 the charge of the signal as measured by the adc . any time jitter from the reference counter drops out when the residual time between two detector planes is determined .",
    "in order to measure the tracks of electrons through a 32-channel fibre detector , it was placed inside the heavy shielding house of spectrometer  a , a large high - resolution magnetic spectrometer at the mainz microtron mami  @xcite .",
    "the focal plane of the spectrometer  a has a length of approximately 2 m , and it is inclined at an angle of 45@xmath31 to the reference particle trajectory .",
    "the divergence of the particle trajectories is about 24@xmath31 .",
    "the fibre detector was sandwiched between the drift chambers and the scintillator paddles of the focal plane detector system .",
    "two vertical drift chambers ( vdcs ) measure the dispersive coordinate @xmath41 plus the corresponding angle @xmath42 and the non - dispersive coordinate @xmath43 plus the angle @xmath44 .",
    "the electron hit position was found by extrapolating the reconstructed track from the focal plane to the fibre detector .",
    "[ fig : mami - vdc](left ) shows the geometrical acceptance covered by the fibre detector inside the spectrometer , determined by such an extrapolation .",
    "the kinematics of the reaction was chosen so that the particle illumination was homogeneous over the fibre detector .",
    "the hit multiplicity of the detector was relatively high , @xmath45 , the main reason being a large optical cross - talk in the mapmt .",
    "a simple estimator for the @xmath41-position of the form @xmath46 was used accordingly , where @xmath47 was the parametrised geometrical centre position of the @xmath48th channel and @xmath49 the hit multiplicity .",
    "this track estimate was compared to the track reconstructed from the vdcs and projected onto the detector base coordinate , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mami - vdc](right ) .",
    "small non - linearities at the edges of the diagonal line indicate that better estimators based on weighted averages were needed .",
    "a detailed analysis of the correlation revealed a few misalignments in the fibre bundles caused by the demanding construction of the @xmath50 geometry .",
    "[ fig : mami - residua](left ) shows the residual of track position defined as the difference between the position reconstructed by the vdcs and the position measured by the fibre detector .",
    "a width of fwhm @xmath2 1.1 mm can be deduced from the distribution .",
    "it is assumed that the resolution of the vdc , @xmath51 100@xmath28 m for the dispersive coordinate , was high compared to the fibre detector .",
    "the trigger detectors of the spectrometer consist of two segmented planes of plastic scintillation detectors .",
    "the arrival time of the electrons was measured in the fibre detector with respect to the following two overlapping paddles .",
    "[ fig : mami - residua](right ) shows the time spectra obtained from the coincidence timing with the trigger scintillators before and after performing the walk correction for the paddles and the calibration of the channel - to - channel variations of the fibre detector .",
    "the combined resolution of fwhm @xmath52ns was rather good for the small amount of light from the fibres .",
    "the detection efficiency was determined by sandwiching the fibre detector between the vdc and the scintillators , and using the three - detector method .",
    "it was found to be 99% independent of the threshold .",
    "in cave  c of gsi tests of a fibre detector with three bundles in a @xmath0c beam of 2@xmath1gev energy were performed .",
    "two bundles of the detector were aligned to a single plane , and one bundle formed a parallel plane directly behind .    in deducing the time resolution , an iteration over all hits in a plane including multiple hits in a channel was performed , and clusters of correlated hit times were searched for . the cluster with the time closest to the trigger signal time was retained , and within the cluster the time of the first arrived signal was chosen as hit time . in the algorithm a minimum time separation of 10ns between clusters and a hit in a coincidence window of 20ns width were required .",
    "a time walk correction for the hit times was not needed .",
    "the hit time residual , defined as the difference between the two hit times in the two planes of fibres , was distributed with a width of fwhm @xmath4 330ps for the carbon beam , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gsic12-tresidual ] .",
    "no significant dependence of the time resolution on photomultiplier high voltage was observed .",
    "the time resolution of a single detector plane was derived to be fwhm @xmath2 330ps@xmath53 230ps .",
    "the pulse height spectra for different high voltages ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56v ) were fitted to get the normalisation , @xmath57 , and the pedestal position , @xmath58 , for each adc channel @xmath48 . with these calibration values",
    "the spectra were corrected for channel - to - channel gain variations .",
    "for 11 neighbouring channels in one plane and the same number of channels in the plane directly behind the pulse height information was available , and the hit channel was determined by the pulse height maximum . to validate the assignment the centroid of charges of up to five channels",
    "was determined .",
    "[ fig : gsic12-abposition ] shows the correlation between the centroids of charges in both detector planes .",
    "the steps are a consequence of the discretisation in fibre channels and appear with a pitch of @xmath59 0.6 mm . taking the centroid of only a limited number of hit channels proved to be superior to the centroid of all hit channels .",
    "the algorithm was applied to the central area of the detector away from the edges , where the number of channels available for the averaging is restricted .",
    "the hit position residual , defined as the difference between the two track position estimates in the two planes of fibres , was measured with a fwhm @xmath2 0.27 mm , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gsic12-xresidual ] .",
    "this accuracy was sufficient for an unambiguous identification of the hit channel , leading to a spatial accuracy of 0.6mm@xmath60 170@xmath28 m ( rms ) . in principle , the resolution can be improved by distinguishing between hits in the overlap region of two neighbouring channels from central hits .",
    "an analysis , which required a minimum charge drop of 10% compared to the neighbours was performed .",
    "the identification of the hit channel was then improved and the identification of overlapping channels became possible , but a large optical cross - talk interferes with such a requirement .",
    "the channel with the pulse height maximum was strongly correlated to the hit time defining channel showing that adc calibration constants and tdc off - set values had both been correctly determined .",
    "it is worth estimating the spatial accuracy of the fibre detector for set - ups without analogue read - out .",
    "cross - talk between neighbouring channels then perturbs the reconstruction of the position of the track position by causing finite hit multiplicity .",
    "since no absolute position of the particle tracks were known , one has to compare the hit channel mean value with the estimated position using the adc information which is assumed to be more accurate . the difference of the hit channel mean value as a simple estimate of track position and the reconstructed position was evaluated by requiring a certain minimum adc value ( typically 70% of the maximum ) to mimic a given discriminator voltage threshold .",
    "this difference still includes contributions from the uncertainties in both position estimators and the granularity of the fibre array .",
    "the distributions were measured with an average @xmath61fwhm@xmath62 @xmath2 0.6 mm ( approx .",
    "the fibre pitch ) , an average @xmath61rms@xmath62 of 0.5 mm , and an average @xmath61fwtm@xmath62 @xmath63 1 mm .",
    "the pulse height distribution of a typical detector channel ( b  24 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsic12-pulseheight](left ) .",
    "the appearance of a series of peaks below the maximum pulse height at adc channel @xmath2 100 was caused by the spread of secondary electrons and the cross - talk between channels that transport a fixed fraction of the signal into neighbouring channels .",
    "the hit multiplicity of one detector plane is shown in fig .",

    "was determined .",
    "the detection efficiency of a plane , i.e.  the probability to find at least one hit in one plane provided a hit in the other plane , was above 99% .",
    "a fibre detector in cave  a of gsi was tested in a p@xmath6d beam of 3.3tm magnetic rigidity with dominant protons of 1gev@xmath26c momentum as well as in a carbon beam of 2@xmath1gev energy .",
