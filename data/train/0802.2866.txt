    "automatic structures were introduced in @xcite and later again in @xcite along the lines of the bchi - rabin equivalence of automata and monadic second - order logic .",
    "the idea is to encode elements of a structure @xmath4 via words or labelled trees ( the codes need not be unique ) and to represent the relations of @xmath4 via synchronised automata . this way we reduce the first - order theory of @xmath4 to the monadic second - order theory of one or two successors . in particular , the encoding of relations defined in @xmath4 by first order formulas are also regular , and automata for them can be computed from the original automata .",
    "thus we have the fundamental fact that the first - order theory of an automatic structure is decidable .",
    "depending on the type of elements encoding the structure , the following natural classes of structures appear : automatic ( finite words ) , @xmath3-automatic ( infinite words ) , tree - automatic ( finite trees ) , and @xmath3-tree automatic ( infinite trees ) .",
    "besides the obvious inclusions , for instance that automatic structures are also @xmath3-automatic , there are still some some outstanding problems .",
    "for instance , a presentation over finite words or over finite trees can be transformed into one where each element has a unique representative .",
    "kuske and lohrey @xcite point out an @xmath3-regular equivalence relation ( namely @xmath5 stating that two infinite words are position - wise eventually equal ) with no @xmath3-regular set of representatives .",
    "thus , unlike the finite - word case , injectivity can not generally be achieved by selecting a regular set of representatives from a given presentation .",
    "in fact , using topological methods it has recently been shown @xcite that there are omega - automatic structures having no injective presentation .",
    "however , we are able to prove that every omega - regular equivalence relation having only countably many classes does allow to select an omega - regular set of unique representants .",
    "therefore , every countable omega - automatic structure does have an injective presentation .    a related question raised by blumensath",
    "@xcite is whether every countable @xmath3-automatic structure is also automatic . in corollary  [ coroll_cnt ]",
    "we confirm this by transforming the given presentation into an injective one , and then noting that an injective @xmath3-automatic presentation of a countable structure can be `` packed '' into one over finite words .",
    "all these results rest on our main contribution : a characterisation of when there exist countably many words @xmath6 satisfying a given formula with parameters in a given @xmath3-automatic structure @xmath4 ( with no restriction on the cardinality of the domain of @xmath4 or the injectivity of the presentation ) . the characterisation is first - order expressible in an @xmath3-automatic presentation of an extension of @xmath4 by @xmath5 .",
    "hence we obtain an extension of the fundamental fact for @xmath3-automatic structures to include cardinality and counting quantifiers such as there exists ( un)countably many , there exists finitely many , and there exists @xmath1 modulo @xmath2 many. this generalises results of kuske and lohrey @xcite who achieve this for structures with _ injective _ @xmath3-automatic presentations .    -0.3",
