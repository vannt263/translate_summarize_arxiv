    "the values for the supergiants show a higher dispersion than those of the blue stars , but the average reddening for the 6 red ( super)giants ( excluding the outlier s61 ) is @xmath85 ( the error is the standard deviation ) , while the average for 7 b - type stars without emission lines is @xmath86 , fully compatible within their errors . using the calibrations of @xcite or @xcite for the blue stars produces slightly different individual values , but compatible averages .",
    "comparison of the @xmath60 ( table  [ membersphot ] ) and @xmath79 excesses for these objects ( table  [ spectypes ] ) confirms that the extinction law in this direction is close to the @xmath87 galactic average , for which @xmath88 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the b - type stars spectroscopically observed consistently have @xmath60 below the cluster average .",
    "this suggest that some of the faint late - b stars taken as photometric members could be background objects .",
    "the dereddened cmd for be  55 ( fig .  [ clean ] ) shows that stars brighter than @xmath89 start deviating from the zams .",
    "this absolute magnitude corresponds to spectral type b4v ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in good agreement with the determination of spectral types , which indicate that the brightest b - type stars are b36iii - iv objects .",
    "with such a turn - off , the cluster is expected to have an age @xmath90  myr .",
    "we can improve on this value by fitting isochrones in the different observational cmds to the position of the red stars and the turn - off .",
    "a fundamental issue is the correct determination of color excesses at such high reddenings .",
    "figure  [ figubv ] shows the observational @xmath55 diagram for the cluster together with isochrones for @xmath91 ( 40  myr ) and @xmath92 ( 50  myr ) from @xcite .",
    "both isochrones fit well the position of the main sequence and the turn - off .",
    "s7 appears as a mild blue straggler , which is consistent with its spectral type ( a b34iii giant when the turn - off is at b4v ) .",
    "s9 may also be a blue straggler , but shell stars are known to have anomalous @xmath28 colors .",
    "the isochrones have been reddened following the procedure described in @xcite , which takes into account color effects for late - type stars . in spite of this ,",
    "the position of the k ( super)giants does not fit the red clump very well for any of the two isochrones .",
    "this is likely due to the difficulty in reproducing the extinction law with the polynomial approximation of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figkj ] shows the @xmath36 cmd for cluster members , with photometry from 2mass .",
    "isochrones from @xcite for the same ages are shown , reddened by @xmath93 , the value found for the blue spectroscopic members .",
    "all members selected from their @xmath0 colors fall to the right of the isochrones , confirming that this excess corresponds to the less reddened members .",
    "some likely members seem to have much higher color excesses , suggesting that they are either be stars or background b - type stars ( though this is not generally supported by their photometric spectral types ) . in this cmd , the k ( super)giants occupy positions in very good agreement with the 50  myr isochrone .",
    "the bright star s61 , situated @xmath94 from the cluster core falls together with the red ( super)giants in this cmd .",
    "however , its position does not fit well with its spectral type , later than all the other evolved stars . as seen in table",
    "[ spectypes ] , its reddening is rather lower than that of confirmed members .",
    "its @xmath27 magnitude , taken from @xcite , is compatible with the low reddening .",
    "therefore this object could be a foreground star as well as a cluster member with much lower reddening .",
    "this should be checked via radial velocity measurements .",
    "we have presented spectroscopy of a sizable sample of stars in the open cluster berkeley  55 , revealing a population of 7 low - luminosity supergiants or bright giants ( one of them , not a certain member ) , 4 mid - b giants and a main sequence starting around b4v .",
    "only two previous studies of the cluster have been published . @xcite",
    "derive an age of @xmath95  myr .",
    "@xcite used their result to calibrate his fitting procedure and therefore derives a similar age of 300  myr , from a fit to the 2mass data alone .",
    "this age is completely incompatible with the observed population , as stars earlier than b5 are only seen in clusters younger than 100  myr",
    ". clusters with @xmath96  myr have stars of spectral type @xmath51b6 around the main - sequence turn - off ( e.g. , ngc  7790 , @xcite ; berkeley  58 , @xcite ) .",
    "the difference between our age determination and that of @xcite is almost certainly due to the identification of the evolved population .",
    "the decontaminated @xmath54 in @xcite does not show a clump of red stars , as in our fig .",
    "[ rawcmd ] . some of the ( super)giants seem to be blended in their images and do not appear in their original photometry .",
    "the others are not conspicuous when a wide field is considered , because of contamination by field interlopers with similar @xmath27 color .",
    "the stars forming this clump , however , can not be overlooked when the infrared data are considered .",
    "s1 is the brightest star in @xmath76 within @xmath97 of the cluster center , and there are only 5 field stars with @xmath76 magnitudes comparable to the 7 red ( super)giants . the 7 candidate members form a clearly separated clump in the @xmath77/@xmath76 , @xmath98/@xmath76 and @xmath63/@xmath76 diagrams , and have similar ( and unusual ) spectral types . though accurate radial velocities will be needed to confirm individual memberships , there can be no doubt that they represent the population of evolved stars in the cluster .",
    "the small systematic offset in @xmath27 between our photometry and that of @xcite is unlikely to have biased their age determination .",
    "it is simply very difficult to obtain an accurate fit when photometry in only two bands is available .    at galactic longitude @xmath99 ,",
    "a distance @xmath100  kpc ( corresponding to our @xmath101 ) seems compatible with tracers of the perseus arm , though some galactic models suggest a higher distance for this feature .",
    "spiral tracers in this direction are scarce .",
    "ngc  7067 ( @xmath102 ) has distance estimates of 3.6  kpc @xcite and 4.4  kpc @xcite .",
    "ngc  7128 ( @xmath103 ) , with @xmath104 ( 4  kpc ) , is another likely tracer at some distance from be  55 @xcite .",
    "as the age of berkeley  55 is @xmath105  myr , the red stars in the cluster should have initial masses @xmath106 @xcite , or slightly higher if they started their lives rotating quickly ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "such stars define the boundary between intermediate - mass and massive stars , and therefore can provide important constraints for stellar evolution models . milky way clusters with similar ages and rich populations of rsgs ( or bright giants )",
    "are relatively scarce .",
    "ngc  6649 ( @xmath105  myr ; @xcite ) with one cepheid and four red ( super)giants is one of the few examples .",
    "ngc  6664 ( also @xmath5150  myr ; @xcite ) has a similar population , but is less well studied . as a consequence ,",
    "the sample of galactic rsgs studied by @xcite contains almost no stars in the @xmath107 range .",
    "the presence of 7 candidate evolved members makes berkeley  55 a very suitable target to study the physical effects operating during the he - core burning phase of intermediate - mass stars .      as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the separation between red supergiants and red bright giants is morphological , and does not coincide with the separation between high - mass and low - mass stars . of course",
    ", making such a distinction necessarily implies dividing a continuum into artificial boxes . in spite of that , defining an age limit after which clusters do not contain rsgs seems interesting , as new clusters are being discovered where high extinction renders only the bright red stars accessible for spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "looking at the lists of yellow evolved stars in clusters from @xcite or @xcite , it is difficult to set an age limit after which ib supergiants are not seen .",
    "a few objects have been classified as kib supergiants in clusters @xmath108  myr old , but in all cases there are alternative lower - luminosity classifications based on more recent data ( for example , star 164 in ngc  129 , classified k2.5ii - iii by @xcite ; or star 110 in ngc  2516 , classified m1.5iia by @xcite ) .",
    "most classical cepheids appear as f / g ib supergiants .",
    "many clusters containing cepheids are sparsely populated and have the cepheid as only supergiant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in clusters with larger populations ,",
    "the ratio of f / g supergiants to later spectral types is very variable .",
    "for example , ngc  7790 contains three f - type cepheids , but no red ( super)giants , while ngc  6067 ( with two cepheid members ) contains a large number of red giants and supergiants @xcite .",
    "if we consider a number of clusters for which accurate ages in the range of interest have been derived through careful photometric analysis or equivalent methods , we find by decreasing age , that ngc  2516 ( @xmath109  myr ) , which has no cepheids , contains four bright red giants , with luminosity classes ii or iii @xcite . ic  4725 , which is @xmath110  myr old , contains one cepheid supergiant and two class ii red giants @xcite .",
    "berkeley  82 , with an age @xmath111  myr contains two yellow bright stars with spectral types g2ii / ib and k2ii @xcite , while harvard  20 contains a g5ib supergiant at @xmath112  myr @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , ngc  6664 , with an age @xmath105  myr , contains several objects classified as bright giants by @xcite .",
    "finally , ngc  6067 contains red stars with luminosity classes ii and ib , leading @xcite to doubt its estimated age @xmath113  myr , which is also in contradiction with the observed period of its fundamental - mode cepheid member v340  nor .    in view of this",
    ", it seems that red stars close to the clump position are classified as k supergiants in clusters up to 5060  myr , while some stars are classified as such in somewhat older clusters .",
    "no cluster older than @xmath96  myr seems to contain a bona - fide k supergiant .",
    "stars with f and g spectral types , such as cepheids , are classified as supergiants at older ages , e.g. , sz tau ( f5 - 9ib ) in ngc  1647 ( @xmath114  myr ; * ? ? ?",
