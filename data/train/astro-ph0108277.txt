    "this cluster contributes to the lensing of a distant z = 1.41 radio loud quasar .",
    "the lensed quasar appears as two images separated by 617 and denoted as a ( north ) and b ( south ) .",
    "an accurate determination of the mass distribution of the cluster is essential in reducing the uncertainty of the hubble constant as derived from the application of refsdal s lensing method ( refsdal , 1964a,1964b ) . due to the limited spatial and spectral resolution and low signal - to - noise ratio of the previous x - ray observations ,",
    "only weak constraints could be placed on the cluster properties . in particular",
    ", we obtained estimates for the convergence parameter , @xmath4 , the ratio of the projected two - dimensional ( 2d ) surface mass density of the cluster to the critical surface mass density of the lens cluster .",
    "we found @xmath4 to range between 0.07 and 0.21 , when assuming that the cluster center was located 24 away from image b , a separation based on optical observations of the galaxy members of the cluster ( angonin - willaime et al .",
    "other methods for estimating the convergence parameter @xmath4 rely on weak - lensing of background galaxies ( fischer et al .",

    "tonry & franx 1999 ; romanowsky & kochanek 1999 ) and measurements of the velocity dispersion of the lens cluster ( garrett , walsh , & carswell 1992 , angonin - willaime , soucail , & vanderriest 1994 ) .",
    "the present constraints on @xmath4 are quite poor and have probably underestimated the systematic errors due to the uncertainty of the location of the cluster center and of the mass profile .",
    "barkana et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found a strong dependence of @xmath4 on the assumed cluster mass profile and on the distance of the cluster center from the lens galaxy .",
    "a measurement of the convergence parameter @xmath4 at the location of the lensed images with respect to the cluster center is needed to break the hubble constant mass - sheet degeneracy ( falco et al .",
    "more direct methods of determining the location of the center of mass of the cluster are provided by measurements of the intracluster medium emission in the x - ray band , the weak lensing method , and optical measurements of the member galaxies .",
    "x - ray measurements with rosat did not provide any useful constraints on the location of the cluster center . the weak lensing method , which determines the mass distribution of the lens cluster from the gravitational distortion of the images of background galaxies , yields a center of mass of the cluster to be located @xmath9 18 east and 13 north of g1 , with a 1@xmath10 uncertainty of about 15 .",

    "for example , garrett et al . (",
    "1992 ) using a subset of the galaxies had found the cluster center at 35 west and 12 north of g1 .",

    "q0957 + 561 was observed with the acis instrument ( garmire et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) onboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ in 2000 april 4 for 47,660s .",
    "the data were collected on the back - illuminated s3 ccd of acis .",
    "the instrument was operated in sub - array mode where a restricted region with 254 of 1024 rows of the chip collects data to reduce the frame - time from the nominal 3.24  s(full - frame ) to 0.741  s. the telescope pointing was set approximately 1 arcmin off axis .",
    "we used the sub - array mode and off - axis pointing to reduce the probability of multiple x - rays landing within a few ccd pixels during the same ccd frame readout .",
    "this effect , commonly referred to as pile - up , may lead to spectral and spatial distortions and loss of detected events .",
    "the detected count rates for images a and b are 0.21  counts s@xmath15 and 0.16  counts s@xmath15 , with respective estimated pile - up fractions of about 11% and 7% for the 0.741  s frame - time .",
    "we applied the data processing techniques recommended by the _ chandra x - ray center _ ( cxc ) which include removal of hot pixels and non - x - ray events .",
    "the standard cxc software pipelines randomize the event positions by @xmath19 0246 ( 1 acis pixel = 0492 ) , in each spatial coordinate .",
    "this randomization is done to avoid aliasing effects noticeable in observations with exposure times less than @xmath9 2  ks .",
    "since the exposure time for the _ chandra _ observation of q0957 + 561 is considerably longer than 2  ks , we reprocessed the data with the cxc software tool ` acisprocessevents ` without randomizing the event positions",
    ". this reprocessing led to an improvement of the 50 percent encircled energy radius from 040 to 035 .",
    "the ccd read - out streaks of the bright images a and b of q0957 + 561 are removed in the spatial and spectral analysis .",
    "these streaks are produced from events that are recorded on the ccd during the transfer of charge into the ccd frame - store region .",
    "the background level was fairly constant throughout the observation with a mean value of 2.2 @xmath20 10@xmath21 events s@xmath15 arcsec@xmath22 in the 0.3 - 7  kev band .",
    "in figure 1 we show the _ chandra _ image of the gl system q0957 + 561 . to enhance the presence of soft extended x - ray emission , the image was filtered to include only photons with energies ranging between 0.5 and 3.0  kev .",
    "this choice of energy range is supported by the analysis of the extracted spectrum of the cluster ( see section 4.1 ) which indicates that the cluster spectrum is very soft with most of the detected counts lying below 3  kev .",
    "the image has been binned with a bin size of 05 and smoothed with the software tool ` csmooth ` developed by ebeling et al .",

    "extended x - ray emission with a radius of @xmath9 30 , encompassing the quasar images , is clearly visible in figure 1 .",
    "the extended emission appears to be centered slightly northeast of image b. this is seen if one takes the midpoint of the two outer contour levels of the x - ray emission shown in figure 1 .",
    "the midpoint is slightly to the east of image b.    to constrain the morphology of the soft extended emission we performed a 2d fit to the x - ray data using the model described below .",
    "the spatial model has the following three components : extended cluster emission , unresolved emission from the quasar images and background emission .",

    "\\(b ) to model the lensed quasar images , we use simulated point spread functions ( psf s ) .",
    "the centroids of the model psf s are fixed to the observed image centroids .",
    "the relative normalization of the psfs is the flux ratio of the lensed images as determined from annular regions of inner and outer radii of 05 and 2 , respectively , centered on the images .",

    "the levenberg - marquardt optimization method is used for the spectral analysis , the powell method is used for the spatial analysis of the cluster and the downhill simplex method is used by the fitting tool ` lynx ` ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "\\(c ) finally in our model , we include a uniform background of 0.01 events per pixel obtained from a background region at the same distance from the aim point as the cluster .    in determining the cluster properties",
    ", we omitted a 10 radius region centered on the midpoint between the quasar images to avoid biasing the fit due to residuals in modeling the cores of the psfs .",
    "for the annulus from 8 to 40 centered on the midpoint of the quasar images , we binned the image in 1 pixels and smoothed this with a gaussian ( @xmath34 ) prior to performing the spatial fitting .",
    "the fits were performed with the cxc software package ` sherpa ` . to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to the choice of assumptions made for sizes of spatial windows and bin sizes of the data , we performed the spatial analysis over a wide range of input model parameters . specifically , we binned the x - ray data with bin sizes varying between 1 and 2 .",
    "the annulus region used to model the cluster was varied with an inner radius ranging between 10 and 14 and an outer radius ranging between 30 and 40 .",
    "the errors quoted for the spatial model parameters represent the maximum uncertainties obtained from all spatial fits .",
    "results for our spatial fits are presented in table 1 .",
    "we find the center of the mass of the lens cluster to be located at @xmath35 = 43@xmath0 east , @xmath36 = 35@xmath1 north of the core of image b. the fits indicate that the smoothed mass distribution of the cluster is close to spherical with an ellipticity @xmath37 .",
    "the best - fit values for @xmath23 and the core radius of the cluster are @xmath23 = 0.47@xmath38 and r@xmath39 = 154@xmath40 ( 62.5 kpc ) , respectively .",
    "our values for @xmath23 and @xmath41 , within the uncertainties , fall on the trend line of @xmath23 versus @xmath41 obtained previously for a suite of galaxy clusters ( jones & forman 1999 ) .",
    "we notice a faint feature in the _ chandra _ image extending northeast of image a that is aligned with the radio jet and appears to have a jet - like morphology .",
    "the x - ray jet is significant at the 4 @xmath10 level . at a redshift of 1.41",
    "this is the most distant x - ray jet detected to date .",
    "an overlay between this x - ray jet feature and a 3.6  cm radio map of the jet in image a ( radio data from harvanek et al .",
    "1997 ) is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the x - ray and radio jet morphologies appear to be somewhat similar .",
    "a comparison between the radio and x - ray jet profiles along the jet ridge line is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the x - ray jet extends ne about 8 from the core of image a with bright knots at 23 , 4 and 6 ( here - after also referred to as knots a , b and c , respectively ) from the core .",
    "each of these knots coincides within 05 with radio knots at similar locations .",
    "the intensity of the x - ray knots appears to decay as a function of distance from the core in contrast to the radio knots which become brighter at larger distances from the core .",
    "one possible interpretation of the former is that the jet flow is decelerating and the brightness change is due to aging of the higher energy electron population of the jet .",
    "the increase in the radio brightness along the jet may be due to an increase of the magnetic field strength .",
    "a similar anti - correlation between radio and x - ray profiles was recently reported in 3c273 ( sambruna et al .",
    "2001 ; marshall et al .",
    "lens models for q0957 + 561 predict a small magnification gradient along the jet .",
    "we estimate that the magnifications for the knots b and c are 1.9 and 1.6 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the magnification gradient does not greatly change the x - ray and radio brightness profiles . in section 4.3",
    "we briefly discuss possible mechanisms that may explain the origin of the x - ray jet emission and present the spectral energy distribution for knots b and c.",
    "the spectrum for the cluster of galaxies was extracted from a 40-radius circle centered on the x - ray determined cluster center . beyond this radius ,",
    "cluster emission is not detected above the background .",
    "three - arcsecond - radius circles centered on images a and b were excluded .",
    "emission from the x - ray jet was also excluded by omitting a rectangle 25 by 7 . however , even beyond the 3 radius , mirror scattering of the bright lensed images produces a significant contamination of the cluster spectrum , particularly at hard energies .",
    "we estimate the spectrum of the contamination produced by images a and b to the cluster spectrum by performing simulations with the raytrace simulator tool ` marx ` provided by the cxc .",
    "we simulate two point sources centered at the locations of images a and b with input spectra and normalizations derived from our spectral analysis of these images .",
    "we find a total of about @xmath9 200 counts due to quasar emission ( @xmath9 0.8% of the total counts from images a and b ) within the cluster extraction region .",
    "the ccd background and quasar contamination are subtracted from the cluster region resulting in the spectrum shown in figure 4 .",
    "a net total of about @xmath9 600 x - ray events originate from the cluster .",
    "the data were fit with the spectral analysis tool ` xspec ` ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "we model the cluster spectrum with a raymond - smith thermal plasma modified by absorption due to our galaxy .",
    "the galactic column density is fixed at the value of n@xmath30 = 0.82 @xmath20 10@xmath31 cm@xmath22 for all spectral fits performed in our analysis .",
    "we assumed a typical value for the metal abundances in clusters of 30% solar ( see , e.g. , henriksen 1985 ; hughes et al .",
    "1988 ; and arnaud et al .",
    "1987 ) . due to the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio of the cluster spectrum the metal abundances of the cluster can not be constrained within useful limits .",
    "if we let the abundance be a free parameter we obtain a best - fit value for the abundance of a = 0.19@xmath42 ( 90% confidence level ) and a best fit temperature of 2.1kev .",
    "we note that the choice of metal abundance ( between 0 and 100% solar ) has little effect on the temperature determinations .",
    "the abundance ratios used in the raymond - smith thermal plasma emission model are those of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "our best - fit model is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the uncertainty in the calibration of acis s3 below 0.5  kev contributes to the large residuals between 0.4 and 0.5  kev .",
    "we find a temperature for the cluster of t@xmath2 = 2.09@xmath3  kev at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the spectral line features between 0.7 and 0.9  kev ( observed frame ) correspond to a redshifted z= 0.36 complex of fe  l lines .",
    "our spectral analysis thus confirms that the extended emission originates from the lens . the relatively low cluster temperature of @xmath9 2  kev and our values of @xmath23 and the core radius from section 3.1 , within their uncertainties , are consistent with the observed correlations between temperature , @xmath23 and core radius obtained previously for a large sample of clusters of galaxies ( jones & forman 1999 ) .",
    "we estimate that @xmath9 3% of the counts originating from cluster emission are excluded from our extracted spectrum due to the regions used in our analysis . correcting for this effect we find a 2 - 10  kev cluster luminosity of 4.7 @xmath20 10@xmath43 erg s@xmath15 .",
    "our estimated values for l@xmath44 and t@xmath2 are consistent with the empirical l@xmath44 - t@xmath2 correlation between cluster luminosity and temperature of , @xmath45 = 0.13(+0.08,-0.07 ) @xmath20 @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the measured 0.5 - 4.5  kev luminosity in units of 10@xmath48 erg s@xmath15 ( @xmath16 = 50 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 ) ( jones & forman 1999 ; markevitch , 1998 ) .",
    "specifically , the l@xmath44 - t@xmath2 correlation yields a value of t@xmath2 @xmath9 2  kev for our value of @xmath47 = 2.3 @xmath20 10@xmath49 .      as mentioned in section 2",
    ", we expect the spectra of images a and b to be slightly piled - up .",
    "we used two independent methods to account for pile - up .    in the first method we extracted spectra from annuli centered on each image with inner and outer radii of 05 and 3 , respectively .",
    "pile - up is significantly reduced beyond the 05 radius , in the wings of the psfs .",
    "one of the drawbacks of the annulus method is that only @xmath9 40% of the total quasar counts are considered in the spectral fit , thus , leading to larger uncertainties in the values of the estimated parameters .",
    "we corrected the ancillary files provided by the cxc to account for the energy dependence of x - ray scattering in the _ chandra _ mirrors within the selected annuli .",

    ". our estimated range of uncertainty in @xmath4 does not include possible systematic errors arising from the estimation of the the surface mass density of the galaxy cluster through the use of a hydrostatic , isothermal @xmath23 model .",
    "evrard , metzler & navarro ( 1999 ) have performed simulations to investigate the accuracy of galaxy cluster mass estimates based on x - ray observations .",
    "they found that estimates based on the hydrostatic , isothermal @xmath23 model are unbiased estimates of the mass of relaxed clusters with standard deviations of less than 30% .",
    "recent observations of clusters of galaxies with xmm - newton indicate that the cluster temperature profiles are remarkably isothermal beyond the central cooling flow ( e.g. , arnaud et al .",
    "we therefore expect that our estimated uncertainity in @xmath4 is dominated by the large uncertainity in the estimated value of the cluster temperature and not systematic errors introduced from the use of the isothermal @xmath23 model .",
    "detailed lens models of q0957 + 561 include the cluster s contribution to the lensing potential by expanding the potential of the cluster in a taylor series and keeping terms of up to third order ( kochanek 1991 , bernstein & fischer 1999 , keeton et al .",
    "the second order term of the expansion represents the shear from the cluster and can be expressed as @xmath84 where , @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the cluster core radius and @xmath87 is the distance from the cluster to the galaxy g1 ( see , kochanek , 1991 ) .",
    "recent models of q0957 + 561 that incorporate additional constraints from observed arcs produced by the lensing of the quasar host galaxy imply a cluster shear amplitude , @xmath88 , that is relatively small compared to the convergence parameter @xmath4 ( keeton et al .",

    "( 2000 ) , one way of producing @xmath88 @xmath90 @xmath4 is to have the distance from the center of the cluster to the center of the lens galaxy be : less than the core radius for a cluster with a singular isothermal ellipsoid potential , or : less than the `` universal '' scale length for a cluster potential that follows the dark matter profile of navarro , frenk , and white ( 1996 )",
    ". measurements at that time , ie .",
    ", the late 1990s , indicated that the cluster center was located several core radii away from the lens ( fischer et al .",
    "1997 ; angonin - willaime et al .",
    "1994 ) and therefore were not consistent with the large value of @xmath4 relative to the amplitude of the shear .",
    "the _ chandra _ observation of the cluster resolves this apparent discrepancy .",
    "we find the distance between the center of mass of the cluster and the center of the lens galaxy g1 to be @xmath87 = 48 considerably smaller than suggested from previous estimates .",
    "the best - fit position angle ( north through east ) and core radius of the cluster are @xmath9 59@xmath14 and 154@xmath91 , respectively .",
    "the _ chandra _ observations of q0957 + 561 therefore indicate that the cluster center is located within a core radius of the lens galaxy g1 . using the values for @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath92 provided by our analysis of the _ chandra _ observation of q0957 + 561",
    "we find that the cluster shear amplitude is @xmath88 = 0.01 @xmath19 0.009 ( 90% confidence level ) , consistent with the recent model results of keeton et al .",
    "observation of q0957 + 561 has eliminated several uncertainties introduced in our previous analysis of the rosat hri data of this system .",
    "specifically , the temperature , the core radius , and cluster shape are now determined more reliably .",
    "previous estimates of @xmath4 are unreliable due to the large distances between the center of the cluster and the galaxy g1 assumed in these analyses . to evaluate the implication of our estimate of @xmath4 on the hubble constant , we write @xmath16 = @xmath93(1 - @xmath94 ) = 100@xmath95 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , where we define the average convergence parameter of the cluster at the image locations as @xmath96 .",
    "due to the mass - sheet degeneracy problem , lens models provide only the model - dependent value @xmath95/(1 - @xmath94 ) .",
    "our present observation of the lens cluster results in a @xmath9 @xmath19 14% uncertainty in the quantity ( 1 - @xmath94 ) .",
    "the resulting uncertainty in @xmath16 is @xmath9 @xmath19 29% , where we have assumed an uncertainty of @xmath9 @xmath19 25% in @xmath93 based on the analysis of keeton et al .",
    "we anticipate that the next generation of lens models for q0957 + 561 may provide tighter constraints on @xmath93 when the constraints on the location , ellipticity and convergence of the cluster , based on the _ chandra _ observations , are incorporated .",
    "as described in section 5 the largest contributor to the present uncertainty in @xmath4 obtained by the x - ray method is the temperature of the intracluster gas . given that the cluster is located near the quasar images , we may optimize a future observation of q0957 by moving the telescope aim point closer to the cluster center to improve the spatial resolution and reduce the contamination of the cluster by the bright images .",
    "this change will reduce the uncertainty of the estimates of the spectral and spatial parameter values for the cluster .",
    "notes- + the probability distributions for the best - fit model parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 derived from our error analysis are not gaussian and any value of @xmath98 and @xmath99 within the quoted errors should be considered to have similar likelihood .",
