    "giant h  ii  regions are ideal laboratories to understand the feedback of star - formation on the dynamics and energetics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "supernov and stellar winds arising in such regions are reponsible for producing shocks , destroying dust grains and molecules , while compressing molecular clouds and triggering subsequent star - formation .",
    "they also allow the release of newly synthetized elements into the ism , altering its metallicity .    in order to study the star - formation properties as a function of the environment , we observed three giant h  ii  regions spanning a wide range of physical conditions ( gas density , mass , age ) and chemical properties ( metallicity ) with the spitzer space telescope ( werner et al .",
    "observations are part of the gto program pid#63 .",
    "the regions are ngc3603 in the milky way , 30doradus ( hereafter 30dor ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , and n66 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "the scope of this program is to address crucial issues such as the destruction of complex molecules by energetic photons arising from massive stars , the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) abundance dependence on metallicity , or conditions that lead to the formation / disruption of massive stellar clusters .",
    "photometry with spitzer / irac ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) has been performed and will be discussed in brandl et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . the brightest mid - infrared ( mir ) regions ( knots , stellar clusters , shockfronts , ... ) were followed spectroscopically with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "2004 ) . in lebouteiller et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we analyzed the spatial variations of the pah and fine - structure line emission across individual photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) in ngc3603 .",
    "the two other regions will be investigated the same way in follow - up papers ( bernard - salas et al .  in preparation ; whelan et al .  in preparation ) . in this paper",
    ", we introduce the full irs dataset ( low- and high - resolution ) of the giant h  ii  regions and we derive their chemical abundances .",
    "a subsequent paper will be focused on the study of molecules and dust properties ( lebouteiller et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "elemental abundances in h  ii  regions are historically derived from optical emission - lines .",
    "large optical telescopes , together with sensitive detectors makes it possible to determine the chemical composition of very faint h  ii  regions . because of dust extinction , optical spectra only observe ionized gas toward sighlines with low dust content . in this view",
    ", the mir range allows analyzing denser lines of sight , with possibly different chemical properties because of small - scale mixing and/or differential depletion on dust grains .",
    "mir emission - lines constitute the only way to measure abundances in more obscure regions , and these abundances ought to be compared to abundances from the optical range .",
    "although the optical domain gives access to some of the most important elements to constrain nucleosynthethic and stellar yields ( c , n , o , ne , s , ar , fe ) , it does not include some essential ionization stages necessary for abundance determinations of certain elements , such as s  iv  or ne  ii .",
    "the mir range enables the abundance determination of ne , s , and ar , with the most important ionization stages observed .",
    "iron abundance can be also determined from mir forbidden emission - lines , but with considerably larger uncertainty due to ionization corrections . finally , it must be stressed that abundance determinations in the optical are more sensitive to the electronic temperature ( @xmath1 ) determination as compared to the mir range .",
    "the effect of @xmath1 on abundances determinations is a significant source of error in optical abundance results .",
    "wu et al .  ( 2007 ) recently studied a sample of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) with the irs and found a global agreement between abundances derived from the optical and those derived from the mir .",
    "this suggests that the dense lines of sight probed in the mir have a similar chemical composition as unextincted lines of sight and/or dense regions with possibly peculiar abundances do not contribute significantly to the integrated mir emission - line spectrum .",
    "mir abundances of the bcds were calculated using mostly h@xmath2 or h@xmath0 lines from the optical as tracer of the hydrogen content , with significant uncertainties from aperture corrections , or different observed regions because of extinction .",
    "the present sample of giant h  ii  regions provides the unique opportunity to measure accurate abundances , with a signal - to - noise ratio sufficiently high to observe directly the h  i  recombination line at 12.37@xmath3 m .",
    "we provide abundances of ne , s , ar , and fe toward lines of sight with different physical properties ( pdrs , ionized gas , embedded source , stellar cluster , ... ) within each giant h  ii  region .",
    "we first present the sample of the three giant h  ii  regions in  [ sec : pres ] .",
    "the data reduction and analysis are discussed in  [ sec : observations ] .",
    "we infer the ion abundances in  [ sec : ionicab ] .",

    "many massive stellar clusters are located across the region ( sabbi et al .",
    "2007 ) , but most of the nebular ionization is thought to be due to ngc346 , the largest stellar concentration in the smc ( dreyer 1888 ) .",

    "finally , we find ( ne  iii / h)/(s",
    "iii / h ) = @xmath122 in n66 , as compared to 10.3 in the optical ( vermeij & van der hulst 2002 ) .",
    "hence the mir spectra seem to probe ionized gas with a degree of ionization equal to or lower than that of the gas probed in the optical",
    ". this could be due to the fact that the sh and lh apertures from the irs do not sample the same spatial regions as those observed within narrow slits used in the optical .",
    "it is also possible that the gases probed in the mir and in the optical have different physical conditions ( such as density ) .",
    "stellar winds and supernov  explosions from the current star - formation episode release newly produced elements into the surrounding ism on a short timescale ( few @xmath123yr ) .",
    "it is thus natural to question the origin of the metals we observe in the ionized gas of the giant h  ii  regions .",
    "we investigate in this section the total metal content of each giant h  ii  region by comparing their metallicities with the sun and other objects from the same host galaxies ( h  ii  regions , planetary nebul ) .",
    "first it must be stressed that the solar abundance determinations have shown strong variations over the past few years ( see e.g. , pottasch & bernard - salas 2006 ) .",
    "the gray stripes in fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] illustrate the range of solar abundance determinations for each element over the 1998 - 2007 period .",
    "neon and argon abundances are particularly poorly determined because of the absence of suitable lines in the solar photosphere .",
    "abundance determinations of those elements are indirect and make use of coronal lines together with a correction using other @xmath0-elements such as magnesium or oxygen . considering the most extreme determinations among the recent studies ( asplund et al .",
    "2006 ; feldman & widing 2003 ) , solar ne / h determinations range from @xmath124 to @xmath125 while ar / h ranges from @xmath126 to @xmath127 .",
    "the sulfur solar abundance is better determined , with values from 7.14 ( asplund et al .",
    "2006 ) to 7.33 ( grevesse et al .  1998 ) .",
    "we consider neon as being the most reliable metallicity tracer available in our study , as compared to sulfur , argon , and iron (  [ sec : neondisc ] ) .",
    "the average neon abundance is @xmath128 in ngc3603 , @xmath129 in 30dor , and @xmath130 in n66 ( table  [ tab : eleab ] ) . considering an average solar value of 7.98",
    ", the average neon abundance in ngc3603 implies essentially a solar metallicity ( @xmath40.91  z@xmath114 ) , while 30dor is @xmath40.60  z@xmath114 , and n66 is @xmath40.23  z@xmath114 .",
    "the metallicity of ngc3603 agrees with the solar metallicity within uncertainties .",
    "this is consistent with the abundance gradient in the milky way ( see , e.g. , martin - hernandez et al .",
    "2002 ) given the fact that the galactocentric distance of ngc3603 is almost that of the sun ( 8.5kpc as compared to 8kpc ;  [ sec : pres_3603 ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare our abundances in 30dor and n66 with those in planetary nebul  ( pne ) and in other h  ii  regions in the lmc and smc from bernard - salas et al .",
    "the authors measured abundances using mir lines in a similar way to the present study so that the comparison does not suffer from significant systematic uncertainties .",
    "bernard - salas et al .  ( 2007 ) found that neon and sulfur abundances in pne agree relatively well with those in the h  ii  regions of the lmc and smc , implying that h  ii  regions have not been significantly enriched over the past few gyrs ( age of the pne progenitor ) .",
    "the global neon abundance we inferred from the mir lines in 30dor is @xmath129 , remarkably close to the average value in the pne of the lmc @xmath28ne / h@xmath131=7.78 ( no quoted errors ) .",
    "the global neon abundance we derive in n66 ( @xmath132 ) is consistent within error bars with the average @xmath28ne / h@xmath131 in the pne of the smc ( 7.43 ) .",
    "in addition , it must be noticed that the metallicity in o dwarf stars in ngc346 , the stellar cluster associated with n66 , is 0.2  z@xmath114 ( bouret et al .",
    "2003 ) , which agrees well with our metallicity determination in the ism of the h  ii  region ( @xmath40.23  z@xmath114 ) .",
    "it seems that the chemical composition of giant h  ii  regions compares well with that of pne and young stars , suggesting that the ionized gas of the h  ii  regions has not been enriched significantly by the current star - formation episode , or by any previous episode more recent than @xmath601gyr .",
    "if enrichment has really occured , the metallicity of the h  ii  regions has been enhanced by much less than a factor 2 .",
    "full mixing requires that elements acquire the same physical conditions as the ionized gas , namely temperature and density , but also viscosity and molecular diffusion ( scalo & elmegreen 2004 ) . the effective mixing provided by turbulent diffusion in h  ii  regions allows metals to mix on spatial scales of a few hundreds parsecs over 100myr ( roy & kunth 1995 ; avillez & mac low 2002 ) .",
    "hence abundance discontinuities between h  ii  regions in a single galaxy should be ubiquitous , especially in low - mass galaxies where rotational shear is weak ( roy & kunth 1995 ) .",
    "however observations challenge this hypothesis and suggest that mixing can occur on spatial - scales as large as the galaxy size and over time - scales larger than the age of the h  ii  regions ( see e.g. , kobulnicky 1998 ; skillman & kennicut 1993 ; noeske et al .",
    "2000 ; russel & dopita 1990 ) .",
    "our results support such spatial- and time - scales and question the fate of metals released by massive stars in giant h  ii  regions . following the scenario of tenorio - tagle ( 1996 )",
    ", the metals could undergo a long cycle in a hot phase before mixing with the surrounding ism .",
    "the composite _ irac _ and _ chandra _ image of 30dor shows large cavities filled with hot gas , surrounded by colder and denser ionized gas shells and filaments ( brandl et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "these are supernova - driven outflows generated by the superstellar cluster ( see also e.g. , redman et al .",
    "the temperature of metals in the hot cavities is too high for recombination to occur , and the density too small for collisionally - excited levels to be populated so that the abundances we derive from the mir spectra do not account for these newly released elements .",
    "the superbubbles of hot gas in 30dor should remain inside the galaxy for hundreds of myr according to the scenario of recchi et al .",
    "it could eventually lead to a superwind that will enable the escape of metals in the halo ( tenorio - tagle 1996 ) .",
    "our observations probe the chemical abundances toward several positions within each giant h  ii  region .",
    "neon and sulfur abundances show remarkably little dispersion in the three giant h  ii  regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] ) .",
    "vermeij & van der hulst ( 2002 ) analyzed 4 positions in 30dor and found neon abundances ranging between 7.84 and 7.94 . analyzing 15 positions",
    ", we find a comparable dispersion , 0.11dex from the mininum to the maximum ne / h values . in the same object , vermeij & van der hulst ( 2002 )",
    "find sulfur abundances ranging from 6.63 to 6.86 , and argon abundances ranging from 6.18 to 6.63 , which is a smaller dispersion than we measured ( but with fewer positions ) .",
    "our results in ngc3603 and n66 also imply that the neon abundance and , to a lesser extent , the sulfur abundance show little dispersion in these regions .",
    "part , if not all , of the dispersion of the elemental abundances is due to uncertainties in the abundance determinations , such as ionization corrections (  [ sec : eleab ] ) and the assumed nebula physical conditions (  [ sec : ionicab_results ] ) . in this section",
    ", we investigate whether there is evidence for small - scale mixing .",
    "the apparent homogeneity of the abundances contrasts with the wide variety of physical regions each line of sight samples toward each object ( pdr , stellar cluster , ionized gas , embedded regions ) .",
    "this suggests that the ionized gas from which we measure the chemical abundances is not necessarily associated with these physical regions .",
    "in fact , the lack of mir line extinction toward pdrs and toward embedded objects implies that the whole nebula is filled with ionized foreground gas ( lebouteiller et al .  in preparation ) . can abundance inhomogeneities still be inferred ?",
    "the material ejected from supernov  could reach a hot coronal phase before falling back onto the galactic disk in the form of molecular droplets ( tenorio - tagle 1996 ) .",
    "this material will then be photodissociated by massive stars and mix with the surrounding ionized gas . according to this model ,",
    "mixing could occur at very small spatial scales ( @xmath601pc ) .",
    "tsamis & pequignot ( 2005 ) introduced in their model of 30dor small - scale chemical inhomogeneities at the subparsec - sized scale .",
    "the typical distance between the irs observations is @xmath124pc in ngc3603 , @xmath1220pc in 30dor , and @xmath1215pc in n66 .",
    "hence our mir observations do not have the necessary spatial resolution to probe such chemical inhomogeneities .    on the other hand , recchi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) proposed that , mostly because of thermal conduction , the sne type ii ejecta start to cool down and mix with the cold gas within a few @xmath123yr before the formation of hot gas outflows . in this particular case ,",
    "small - scale mixing could be observed locally . in order to assert whether small - scale mixing is responsible for the abundance variations we observe across each giant h  ii  region , we use ne / h in 30dor as a reference . the standard deviation of ne / h is 0.02dex , implying that the abundance of neon could vary as much as @xmath45% across the region .",
    "interestingly , 5% of the neon abundance currently present in 30dor corresponds to the total neon enrichment that the star - forming dwarf galaxy izw18 experienced so far ( ne / h = 6.40 ; izotov et al .",
    "kunth & sargent ( 1986 ) proposed that the metallicity of izw18 represents the minimum chemical enrichment of an h  ii  region from a starburst episode .",
    "it is unlikely that the small - scale variations in a single giant h  ii  region correspond to the yields from a starburst episode , especially considering the fact that the metals in the ionized gas are not likely to be cotemporal with the star - formation episode (  [ sec : cosmic ] ) .",
    "uncertainties on the measurements and on the abundance determination method ( @xmath65dex for ne / h , i.e. , as much as 55% ) are too large to constrain possible abundance fluctuations of less than 5% at the metallicity of 30doradus .",
    "we analyzed the chemical abundances in the ism of three giant h  ii  regions , ngc3603 in the milky way , 30dor in the lmc , and n66 in the smc using the mir lines observed with the irs onboard spitzer .",
    "* our observations probe the ism toward various physical regions , such as stellar clusters , ionized gas , photodissociation regions , and deeply embedded mir bright sources .",
    "the spectra show the main ionization stages of neon , sulfur , and argon in the ionized gas .",
    "we also detect [ fe  ii ] and [ fe  iii ] lines . * ionic abundances of ne  ii , ne  iii , s  iii , s  iv , ar  ii",
    ", ar  iii , fe  ii , and fe  iii  were derived .",
    "the internal variation of electron density across a region has no impact on the ionic abundance determination . on the other hand",
    ", we find that electron temperature uncertainties and/or intrinsic variations could be responsible for an error of 20% at most on the abundance determinations . based on the ( ne  iii / h)/(s  iii / h ) ionic abundance ratio",
    ", we find that the optical spectra probe a gas with a degree of ionization equal to or higher than the gas probed in the mir .",
    "* elemental abundances were determined from the ionic abundances .",
    "no ionization corrections were needed , except for iron .",
    "we find that neon , sulfur , and argon scale with each other , which is expected from stellar yields .",
    "abundances do not show any dependence on the physical region ( pdr , stellar cluster , embedded region , ... ) . *",
    "the ne / s ratio is larger than the solar value , and suggests that sulfur could be depleted onto dust grains .",
    "the sulfur abundance in the mir agrees best with the lowest optical determinations , which is likely due to uncertainties in the abundance determinations . *",
    "iron abundance shows a larger uncertainty than ne / h , s / h , and ar / h . the comparison of iron and neon abundances hints at significant depletion of iron onto dust grains at large metallicities .",
    "the agreement with the optical determination of fe / h indicates however that there is no differential depletion on dust grains between the gas probed in the mir and in the optical .",
    "* fe / h is found to be spectacularly large in one position , corresponding to a supernova remnant .",
    "this strongly suggest that iron atoms have been released from dust grains due to schocks from the sn . *",
    "the metallicity of ngc3603 agrees with the galactic abundance gradient .",
    "the metallicities of 30doradus and n66 agree well with those of the pne in their respective host galaxies .",
    "these findings suggest that the giant h  ii  regions did not experience a significant metal enrichment for at least 1gyr .",
    "if enrichement occured , the metallicity was altered by less than a factor of two .",
    "* neon and sulfur abundances show remarkably little dispersion in the three h  ii  regions ( e.g. , 0.11dex dispersion in 15 positions in 30dor ) .",
    "small - scale mixing is apparently effective , abundance fluctuations are smaller than @xmath1255% . however , internal variations of the abundances are likely to be on the order of @xmath605% , and determining their existence would require a significant improvement of the data quality and of the method to be evidenced .",
