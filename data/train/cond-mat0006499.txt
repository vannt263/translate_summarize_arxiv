    ", coulomb correlations may also result in a shot - noise suppression .",
    "if the electron density injected into a ballistic conductor is low , the electron gas is nondegenerate , and fermi statistical correlations are not efficient . for this case",
    "the coulomb correlations are the main source of the shot - noise suppression , as has been demonstrated by monte carlo simulations , @xcite and subsequently analytically in a framework of the vlasov system of equations .",
    "@xcite in nanoscale devices , however , the injected carriers are usually degenerate , which is due to a high level of contact doping and the elevated position of the fermi level in the contact emitter . therefore , it is of interest to consider the situation when both mechanisms , fermi and coulomb correlations , act together  the case that is important not only from a fundamental , but also from an applied point of view @xcite and has attracted less attention so far .",

    ".   the problem for a multimode degenerate conductor in the presence of a nearby gate has been posed , and the numerical results has been presented for a two - dimensional field - effect - transistor geometry .",
    "monte carlo simulations in a two - terminal geometry , which take into account the degenerate injection from the contacts and coulomb correlations in the ballistic region , have been performed .",
    "@xcite the relative significance of each mechanism in the shot - noise suppression and the limiting values for the noise suppression factors of each mechanism still remain unclear , since the analytical theory has not been proposed .",
    "it is the objective of the present paper to address the problem of a shot - noise suppression under the conditions of the interplay between fermi and coulomb correlations in two - terminal multimode ballistic conductors . to this purpose , we apply the recently developed analytical theory @xcite for space - charge - limited ( scl ) ballistic conductors to the case of a fermi - dirac degenerate injection . since we address the case of thick ( in transversal dimensions ) samples , the number of transversal modes ( quantum channels ) is large and the dimensionality of a momentum space of electrons is three - dimensional ( 3d ) , which makes a difference with the previous considerations of a one - channel or a few - channel quantum ballistic conductors ( 1d or quasi-1d momentum space ) .",
    "@xcite our analysis goes beyond the linear - response regime and zero - temperature limit ,  the assumptions typically used to study a - few - channel conductors .",
    "@xcite in a semiclassical framework , for a multimode ballistic conductor , we have derived analytical formulas that determine the _ nonlinear _",
    "@xmath6-@xmath7 characteristics , the current - noise spectral density , and the shot - noise suppression factors for each suppression mechanism in the limit of high biases .",
    "we show that the fermi shot - noise - suppression factor is limited below by the value determined by the properties of the injecting contact ( the ratio between the temperature and the fermi energy ) , whereas the coulomb noise suppression may be enhanced arbitrarily strong by extending the length of the ballistic sample with a simultaneous increase of bias ( provided the transport remains ballistic ) .",
    "therefore , the coulomb suppression may be achieved much stronger even in samples with a high degree of an electron degeneracy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the semiconductor structure under consideration and discuss the main assumptions concerning the model . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the electron distribution function over the longitudinal injection energy , found by integrating over the transversal modes .",
    "the analytical expression for the mean current is derived as a function of the self - consistent potential barrier height . then , in the limit of high biases , the current - voltage characteristics beyond the child approximation is obtained , which takes into account the degenerate fermi - dirac injection . in sec .",
    "iv the analytical expression for the suppressed value of the shot - noise power is derived , in which the fermi- and coulomb - correlation contributions are distinguished .",
    "the results for a particular gaas semiconductor scl diode are presented in sec .",

    "vi summarizes the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "we consider a two - terminal semiconductor ballistic sample with plane - parallel heavily doped contacts at @xmath8=0 and @xmath8=@xmath9 . the structure may be considered as a @xmath10-@xmath11-@xmath10 scl homodiode @xcite in which the current is determined by a charge injection from the contacts rather than by intrinsic carriers of the ballistic region .",
    "the applied bias @xmath12 between the contacts is assumed to be fixed by a low - impedance external circuit and does not fluctuate . in order to simplify the problem",
    ", we assume that due to the large difference in the carrier density between the contacts and the sample , and hence in the corresponding debye screening lengths , all the band bending occurs in the ballistic base , and the relative position of the conduction band and the fermi level does not change in the contacts .",
    "therefore , when the bias is changed , the potential can vary exclusively inside the ballistic base , and the contacts are excluded from the consideration .",
    "@xcite the electron gas inside the contacts is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , in contrast to the previous works , @xcite the fermi level in respect to the bottom of the conduction band , denoted here @xmath2 , may take not only negative , but positive values as well , i.e. , the injected electrons may be either degenerate or nondegenerate , and follow , in general , the fermi - dirac distribution . assuming the transversal size of the conductor sufficiently thick and high enough electron density , the electrostatic problem is considered in a one - dimensional plane geometry .",
    "to describe the steady - state transport and low - frequency noise , we use a semiclassical vlasov system of equations , which consists of the collisionless boltzmann transport equation for the distribution function and the poisson equation for the self - consistent electrostatic potential .",
    "@xcite due to a stochastic nature of the injection , the distribution function and , consequently , the self - consistent potential both fluctuate in time .",
    "the nonuniform distribution of the injected carriers leads to the creation of the potential minimum @xmath13 at a position @xmath14 .",
    "the potential minimum acts as a barrier for the electrons by reflecting a part of them back to the contact , thereby affecting the transport and noise properties .",
    "it is the potential minimum fluctuations that induce the long - range coulomb interactions and lead to the suppression of the injected current fluctuations .",
    "@xcite we assume that the applied bias @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the electron charge and @xmath1 is the temperature . from this",
    "follows that the current is determined by only one injecting contact ( at @xmath8=0 for definiteness ) , and the electrons from this contact that are able to pass over the barrier and arrive at the receiving contact at @xmath8=@xmath9 are all absorbed with the probability 1 , since the corresponding energy states are empty .",
    "all the electrons injected from the receiving contact are reflected back because of the high - bias condition .",
    "their contribution to the current and noise is negligible .",
    "another assumption on the bias is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the potential barrier height , and @xmath19 is the bias at which the potential barrier vanishes .",
    "@xcite in this limit ( `` virtual - cathode approximation '' ) , only the electrons that are able to pass over the fluctuating barrier contribute to the current and noise .",
    "the nonhomogeneous electron density along the ballistic region is determined by @xcite    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the mean potential referenced to the minimum , with the value @xmath22 at the injecting contact .",
    "it is clear that in such a definition the contact potential is equal to the potential barrier height , @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath24 is the distribution function over the longitudinal kinetic energy @xmath25 at the injecting contact .",
    "since during the ballistic motion only the longitudinal electron momentum may vary , the injection distribution function is averaged over the transversal momentum @xmath26 :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the dimension of a momentum space , @xmath29 the electron effective mass , @xmath30 the planck constant , @xmath31 the occupation number of a quantum state , the factor 2 takes into account the spin variable , and the additional factor @xmath32 has been introduced for normalization convenience . assuming that the number of transversal modes is large , the dimension of a momentum space @xmath28=@xmath33 , and we can perform integration over the transversal states . changing the variable of integration @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the transverse electron energy , and taking into account that @xmath36 , with @xmath37\\}^{-1}$ ] the fermi - dirac distribution , one gets    @xmath38\\},\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is the effective density of states . integrating the distribution function ( [ fc ] ) over the energy , one obtains the electron density injected from the contact ,",

    "the injected electron density may also be expressed in a more familiar form    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the fermi - dirac integral of index @xmath44 . since the fermi - dirac integrals @xmath45 of different indexes @xmath46 will be frequently used throughout the paper , their properties are summarized in the appendix .",
    "note that @xmath47 is half of the contact electron density @xmath48 , since only the electrons with positive momenta are injected into the sample .    substituting the distribution ( [ fc ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ den ] ) taken at @xmath8=@xmath49 , one obtains the electron density at the potential minimum :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the parameter characterizing the position of the fermi energy with respect to the potential barrier .",

    "the steady - state current is obtained by @xcite    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the cross - sectional area . substituting the distribution function ( [ fc ] ) ,",
    "one gets    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the fermi - dirac integral ( see the appendix ) .",
    "it is seen that under the ballistic scl conduction , the current is determined by the relative position of the fermi energy and the potential barrier through the parameter @xmath58 .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of diffusive conductors , in which the current is determined by scattering strength .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 summarizes the dependence of the current on the applied bias and the length of the conductor , since they both affect the potential barrier height , whereas the factor @xmath59 is independent of those characteristics .",
    "figure [ f1 ] illustrates the electric current as a function of @xmath58 given by eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) .",
    "when the fermi energy is sufficiently below the potential barrier , @xmath60 , only the exponential tail of the contact distribution function is injected ( nondegenerate injection limit ) .",

    "the contact electron density is nondegenerate , and this is the case of the maxwell - boltzmann injection , analyzed in detail in ref .  .",

    "( 46 ) of ref .  ] . for @xmath71 and @xmath60 ,",
    "the injected electrons that pass over the barrier are nondegenerate , but the contact electrons are degenerate ; hence the approximate formula ( [ iasym11 ] ) for the current is no longer valid , and one has to use a more general relation , eq .",
    "( [ iasym1 ] ) .",
    "it should be also noted that in the general case of a fermi - dirac injection , the contact emission current is @xmath72 .",
    "this is the maximum ( saturation ) current that is achieved when the applied bias @xmath73 , the barrier vanishes ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) , and the conduction is no longer space - charge limited .",
    "the current in units of its saturation value is simply    @xmath76    = 8.0 cm    it was shown in a previous paper @xcite that the asymptotic behavior of the current in scl ballistic conductors obeys the child law in the leading - order terms independently of the injection distribution :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the dielectric permittivity , and @xmath9 is the length of the ballistic conductor .",
    "however , this formula is only accurate at very high biases , in the range where the scl conduction is difficult to maintain .",
    "this is a consequence of a rough approximation , in which the velocity spread of electrons at the potential minimum is neglected . to obtain a satisfactory good approximation at lower biases ,",
    "it is necessary to keep the next - order terms that are specific with respect to the injection distribution .",
    "the general formula for an arbitrary injection function has been recently derived : @xcite    @xmath79    in our case of the injection distribution function ( [ fc ] ) , one finds the following expression    @xmath80    in the nondegenerate limit , @xmath60 , one obtains ( @xmath81 , and eq .
