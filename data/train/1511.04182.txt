    "the korteweg - devries ( kdv ) equation @xcite has for long served as a paradigmatic model for the study of low frequency weakly nonlinear dispersive waves in a wide variety of physical systems @xcite . as a completely integrable nonlinear partial differential equation",
    "the model has not only been the subject of numerous mathematical studies @xcite but has also lent itself to practical applications due to its large class of exact nonlinear solutions @xcite .",
    "in particular , the class of solutions consisting of nonlinear solitary pulses , known as solitons , have been much studied both theoretically and experimentally because of their remarkable properties . in plasma physics",
    "the kdv model has been very successfully applied to the study of nonlinear ion - acoustic waves @xcite as well as to other low frequency waves such as dust ion - acoustic waves ( daws ) in dusty plasma systems @xcite .",
    "the soliton form of ion acoustic waves results from an exact balance of the nonlinear steepening and dispersive broadening effects that a finite wave pulse experiences in the medium .",
    "a similar mechanism is responsible for the formation of solitonic structures in surface water waves - the classic historical example of which is the long lived mound of water that sir russell scott had observed in a canal and chased for long on horseback @xcite . the soliton structure in this case had resulted from the sudden stopping of a boat that was being dragged in the canal and that had caused a large amplitude perturbation of the water surface .",
    "more recently water wave solitons have also been observed and studied for a situation where the boat keeps moving at a certain speed and acts as a continuous source of perturbation @xcite .",
    "these driven solitons are found to be generated ahead of the boat when the boat velocity exceeds the phase velocity of the linear surface waves while wake waves are seen to be generated behind the boat for all velocities .",
    "this fascinating phenomenon of precursor solitons has received much attention in the hydrodynamic literature and has been well explained by a driven version of the kdv model , namely the forced kdv ( fkdv ) equation @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , to the best of our knowledge , the fkdv equation has not received any attention in the plasma community although physical situations analogous to that in hydrodynamics are conceivable in plasma physics .",
    "the direct equivalent of the moving object in a neutral fluid is a moving charged object in a plasma that can give rise to ion acoustic wave excitations in the form of wakes and or solitons .",
    "while wake fields due to moving charged objects are well known in plasmas @xcite the phenomenon of excitation of precursor solitons ahead of the moving charge has not been investigated .",
    "in a recent theoretical study we have derived the fkdv equation as an appropriate model equation for the nonlinear driven excitation of ion acoustic waves in a plasma and discussed the possibility of creating precursor solitons in the ionospheric plasma @xcite . charged objects moving at supersonic speeds",
    "can also occur in laboratory situations such as in ion beam driven inertial fusion schemes .",
    "the excitation of precursor solitons in such a case can impact the nature of energy deposition on the target pellet and thereby influence its compression and heating characteristics .",
    "it is not always necessary for the object to move at supersonic speeds but a fluid ( plasma ) moving at a supersonic speed over a stationary ( charged ) object can also give rise to a similar scenario .",
    "examples of such fast streaming plasmas are plasma jets emitted from astrophysical objects and , nearer home , the solar wind hitting the earth .",
    "supersonic plasma flows can also be easily created in table top laboratory experiments and can offer a means to test out the existence of such a phenomenon in plasmas .",
    "thus it is important to understand the conditions under which such excitations can occur and the physical mechanisms underlying such a phenomenon .    in the present paper",
    "we show that the excitation of precursor solitons is not restricted to the fkdv equation but can also occur within the general framework of the cold ion fluid equations that is so extensively used to study ion acoustic waves in plasmas .",
    "our numerical investigation of the full set of fluid equations , that are driven by a source term , reveal a rich variety of nonlinear solutions some of which are generalizations of the fkdv equation and include wakes , precursor solitons and pinned solitons .",
    "we delineate the existence regions of these solutions and also investigate their characteristics as a function of the driver velocity , the driver amplitude and the width of the driving source .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , section [ gov ] ,",
    "we describe the one dimensional cold fluid model with a moving source term and briefly discuss its reduction in various limits to the kdv , the generalized kdv and the fkdv equations . in section [ ext ]",
    "we look for stationary frame solutions of the system that are moving at the speed of the source term and discuss their relation with the soliton solutions of the generalized sagdeev potential ( in the absence of the source ) and the so called `` pinned '' solitons of the fkdv in the presence of the source . in section [ rand_exact ]",
    "we present our numerical solutions of the full set of fluid equations that identify conditions under which we get precursor solitons and wakes .",
    "section [ concl ] provides a summary of our results and a brief discussion of their potential significance for plasma applications .     of eq .",
    "[ fn_diff2 ] with the source term @xmath0 $ ] with @xmath1 , @xmath2 for different values of the moving frame velocity , namely , @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "these solutions move at the frame velocity and are thus stationary solutions in the frame of the moving source.,width=302,height=264 ]",
    "the evolution of finite amplitude ion acoustic waves in a plasma are well described by a basic fluid model that takes account of the ion dynamics and treats the lighter electron species to have a boltzmann distribution .",
    "we consider a situation where the ion acoustic wave excitations are being continuously driven by a charged source moving at a constant velocity @xmath5 . for simplicity",
    "we consider a one dimensional situation for which the model equations can be written down as , @xmath6 here , @xmath7 are the density and velocity of the ion fluid respectively and @xmath8 is the electrostatic potential .",

    "( [ basiceq1]-[basiceq3 ] ) leads to the well known korteweg - devries equation that has been the subject of numerous studies in the past .",
    "the kdv equation , a completely integrable nonlinear partial differential equation admits a special class of exact solutions called solitons that arise from a perfect balance between nonlinear steepening and dispersive broadening of a finite amplitude pulse .",
    "ion acoustic solitons have received a great deal of theoretical as well as experimental attention in plasma physics and have been invoked to explain diverse nonlinear phenomena observed in the laboratory as well as in space plasmas .",
    "the kdv equation is appropriate for small amplitude waves such that the approximation of weak nonlinearity invoked for the perturbation analysis holds good @xcite .",
    "such an assumption permits the expansion of the exponential term in poisson s equation and the neglect of terms beyond @xmath17 to close the system . using the same approximation and assuming the source term @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ basiceq3 ] ) to be of order @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is an expansion parameter that represents the smallness of the amplitude ) the reductive perturbation technique can be employed to derive a driven version of the kdv equation , the so - called forced kdv ( fkdv ) equation , given by ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 are stretched variables and @xmath22 is the source term , with @xmath23 ( note the unity term stands for the normalized linear phase velocity of the ion acoustic ) .",

    "although not as well known or widely studied as the kdv equation the fkdv equation has nevertheless been the subject of numerous studies for its interesting mathematical properties as well as for its applications in hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "it admits a class of exact solitonic solutions for some special analytic forms of the source term .",
    "these solutions move at the same speed as the source and are called `` pinned '' solitons . for arbitrary forms of the source function and when the source moves at supersonic velocities the solution of the fkdv shows the continuous periodic emission of solitons ahead of the source and the generation of weak wake fields behind the source .",
    "these precursor solitons move faster than the source and are a novel feature of the fkdv equation .",
    "they have been well studied in the fluid mechanics community and have been invoked to explain experimental observations of nonlinear water wave structures created ahead of a ship moving in a narrow channel or in situations when a fluid flows over a submerged object @xcite .",
