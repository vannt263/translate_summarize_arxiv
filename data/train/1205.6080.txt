    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is successfully running and collecting data .",
    "it is hoped that in the near future signs of `` new physics '' will show up .",
    "once a signal for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been established , one would need to identify the underlying theory , and to determine its parameters . for a given theory in an ideal world a certain parameter choice would lead to a unique experimental signature . in this case",
    "the `` inverse problem '' , of going from experimental observables to parameters of the underlying theory , would have a unique solution .",
    "however , it is quite possible that  even within a given theory ",
    "several different sets of parameters reproduce all observables that are available at a given time .",
    "note that we are here not concerned about ( small ) regions of parameter space centered around the true solution ; it is clear that in the presence of non  vanishing experimental errors , a finite region of parameter space will be allowed even if the inverse problem does have a unique solution .",
    "rather , the concern is that quite different , not necessarily connected regions of parameter space can not be disentangled using only ( future ) lhc data .",
    "this issue has been studied in most detail in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm , the mssm @xcite .",
    "most studies focused on determining the masses of specific sparticles using features of kinematic distributions , including invariant mass `` edges '' @xcite or `` kinks '' in more complicated observables @xcite .",
    "this uses only kinematical information , and ideally allows to directly determine the masses of the involved superparticles .",
    "these can then be compared to predictions of specific models of supersymmetry breaking , or to fix the parameters of such models .",
    "the model dependence thus enters only at the last stage of the analysis .",
    "one disadvantage of these kinematical methods is that dynamical information , i.e. information on counting rates which determine products of cross sections and branching ratios , is not used at all .",
    "it has been realized quite early that ( ratios of ) numbers of events of specific types can be used to discriminate between variants of the mssm @xcite .",
    "more recently , information on the total event rate after cuts has been shown to improve the performance of purely kinematical fits @xcite . even in that case",
    "this method has generally only been used in constrained versions of the mssm , with a rather small number of free parameters .",
    "this allows to focus on the most prominent kinematical features , since only a small number of masses needs to be measured in order to determine all free parameters of the theory .",
    "another disadvantage of parameter reconstruction based on kinematic edges or kinks is that it is not straightforward to automatize them .",
    "generally human intervention is required to detect an edge .",
    "this method is therefore well suited to detailed analyses of benchmark points ( and eventually of real data , it is hoped ) , but can not easily be used for broad scans of parameter space .    in order to overcome the last two disadvantages , arkani ",
    "hamed _ et .",
    "@xcite attempted a `` brute  force '' approach to the parameter reconstruction issue in the context of a quite general version of the mssm with 15 free parameters defined at the weak ( or superparticle mass ) scale .",
    "they randomly generated 43,026 sets of parameters , called `` models '' by them .",
    "for each parameter set they monte carlo generated the number of events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath2{fb^{-1}}$ ] at a center of mass energy of @xmath3{tev}$ ] .",
    "they analyzed these events using a total of 1808 observables .",
    "most of them are kinematical observables ( based on invariant mass and transverse momentum distributions ) ; less than ten percent of the observables are counting observables ( number of events with a certain property ) .",
    "based on a statistical analysis , 283 so  called degenerate model pairs were identified .",
    "these are pairs of parameter sets that could not be distinguished by their method of comparison with an estimated @xmath4{\\%}$ ] confidence level @xcite .",
    "note that the analysis of ref.@xcite used a very large number of observables , but was still unable to distinguish between even quite different spectra , even though the sparticle mass scale did not exceed @xmath5{tev } $ ] .",
    "this can be interpreted as implying that the lhc experiments are in principle incapable of determining all mssm parameters in a model  independent fashion .",
    "however , the analysis of ref.@xcite has several weaknesses . to begin with ,",
    "initial state radiation and the `` underlying event '' ( thought to arise from interactions between the `` spectator partons '' not taking part in the primary hard interaction ) are ignored .",
    "these features enlarge the event ; since they do not depend much on the produced final state , they can be expected to reduce the observable differences between different parameter sets even more , i.e. to increase the number of degenerate pairs .",
    "another criticism is that arkani",
    "_ use a single `` @xmath6like '' quantity , called @xmath7 , to analyze the information of all 1808 observables ; here @xmath8 stand for two sets of parameters , and @xmath7 essentially sums the squared differences between the predicted observables , divided by the squared total error of these observables , and normalized to the number of observables included .",
    "an observable is included in the definition of @xmath7 only if the total error is smaller than both predictions or smaller than the difference between the predictions ; this is meant to reduce the dilution of @xmath7 by observables that are so poorly measured that they can not discriminate between parameter sets .",
    "nevertheless the dilution of the statistical measure by observables with little discriminatory power remains an issue .",
    "in fact , arkani  hamed et al . found @xcite that 46 out of the 283 `` degenerate '' pairs had ( at least ) one observable differing by more than 5 estimated standard deviations , even if one only considers the subset of observables constructed from final states containing two charged leptons .",
    "they do not consider this to be significant , since when comparing 2,600 parameter sets with themselves , but run with different seed of the monte carlo event generator , they found 611 cases where ( at least ) one di ",
    "lepton observable differed by more than five estimated standard deviations between the two runs .",
    "this example casts serious doubt on the estimate of the standard deviation of @xmath7 used in ref.@xcite .",
    "recall that for a normal ( gaussian ) distributed observable , the probability of two measurements to differ by more than five ( true ) standard deviations is about @xmath9 . by our count arkani ",
    "hamed et al .",
    "include around 1,000 di ",
    "lepton observables .",
    "even if they were all statistically independent , one would expect at most @xmath10 observables to differ at more than five standard deviations .",
    "since the observables used in ref.@xcite are actually highly correlated , as acknowledged by arkani ",
    "hamed et al . , the number of statistically independent di ",
    "lepton observables is much smaller than 1,000 , reducing the probability to observe true @xmath11 fluctuations even more .",
    "the fact that 611 such fluctuations were observed thus indicates a problem with the estimate of the error and/or with the generation of the events .",
    "a possibly related issue is that the correlations between observables are not included in the definition of @xmath7 @xcite ; this is why this quantity is a `` @xmath6like '' variable , rather than a true @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the statistical interpretation of this observable is not a priori clear .",
    "arkani  hamed et al .",
    "address this problem by again comparing parameter sets to themselves , generated with different seeds of the random number generator .",
    "they found that in @xmath12{\\%}$ ] of all cases @xmath13 even for the same parameter set .",
    "they therefore defined @xmath13 as equivalent to two sets of parameters being distinguishable at @xmath4{\\%}$ ] confidence level .",
    "this inference is not obvious to us , since the statistical properties of @xmath7 are a priori unknown , and the comparison of parameter sets with themselves yielded results that seem violently at odds with the usual interpretation in terms of standard deviations .",
    "finally , the variable @xmath7 is constructed to resemble a @xmath0 comparing two different measurements , both of which are assigned the statistical uncertainties expected for a data sample of @xmath2{fb^{-1}}$ ] .",
    "however , the issue is whether , given that nature chose parameter set a , a measurement can exclude the _ prediction _ made for parameter set b. this prediction should ( in principle ) have negligible statistical uncertainty .",
    "it is not clear to what extent this distorts the statistics , since the cut  off for @xmath14 that defines which",
    "pairs are deemed indistinguishable is determined by monte carlo experiments ; however , conceptually there is a significant difference between comparing two experiments and comparing an experiment with a prediction .    in this paper",
    "we re  analyze the degenerate pairs of ref.@xcite ; for statistical tests we also employ a larger sample of pairs with slightly larger @xmath7 .",
    "we include initial  state radiation as well as the underlying event , and analyze events at the hadron level .",
    "we want to construct a true @xmath0 , in order to have an observable with well  defined statistical properties .",
    "moreover , we focus on counting signatures .",
    "one reason for this is that it is relatively easy to define statistically independent counting rates , by simply defining mutually exclusive classes of events .",
    "in contrast , since all events of a given class contribute to various kinematical observables , these observables will be statistically correlated .",
    "a second reason is that there is a much larger literature on using kinematical quantities @xcite than on the use of counting rates @xcite .",
    "here we want to show that counting rates can play an important role in discriminating between sets of mssm parameters ; we view this as a first step towards a determination of the values of these parameters , including statistically meaningful errors .",
    "altogether we employ ( at most ) 84 observables when comparing sets of parameters .",
    "since most of these observables are counting rates , which should not depend sensitively on details of the detectors , we do not use a detector simulation ( unlike ref.@xcite ) ; however , we use realistic efficiencies when counting @xmath15jets and @xmath16leptons . moreover , unlike ref.@xcite we also investigate the effect of sm backgrounds .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the definition of the sets of parameters , as well as some technical details of our simulation . in sec .",
    "3 we list the observables we use , and construct an overall @xmath0 variable out of them .",
    "we perform some checks to show that this variable has the desired statistical properties .",
    "section  4 contains the results of our numerical analysis , and we conclude in sec .",
    "details of the definition of objects ( jets , leptons ) and of the cuts employed are given in the appendices .",
    "in this section we give some details of our simulation .",
    "we start with a description of how the sets of mssm parameters were chosen in ref.@xcite , and then describe how we generate events .      here",
    "we follow ref.@xcite . there",
    "the mssm spectrum was parameterized directly at the superparticle mass scale , using the following 15 free parameters : three gaugino masses @xmath17 ( bino ) , @xmath18 ( wino ) and @xmath19 ( gluino ) ; four independent slepton masses @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; six independent squark masses @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; the higgs(ino ) mass parameter @xmath30 ; and the ratio of vacuum expectation values @xmath31 .",
    "the masses of the first and second generation sfermions with given quantum numbers are taken equal ; this automatically satisfies stringent constraints on flavor changing neutral currents in this sector @xcite .",
    "four additional parameters are fixed , namely the trilinear scalar couplings @xmath32{gev}$ ] and the pseudoscalar higgs pole mass @xmath33{gev}$ ] . out of the @xmath34parameters ,",
    "only @xmath35 is expected to have significant influence on lhc phenomenology in the context of the mssm , but determining its parameters is expected to be quite difficult . fixing its value therefore reduces the difficulty of the overall problem .",
    "similarly , determining @xmath36 is likely quite difficult , unless it is so small that the heavy higgs bosons can be produced abundantly .",
    "43,026 sets of parameters were then generated in @xcite , by randomly chosing values of the free parameters , with probability distributions that are flat within certain ranges .",
    "in particular , the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath30 and the four slepton masses lie between @xmath37{gev}$ ] and @xmath38{tev}$ ] .",
    "the gluino mass and the six squark masses lie between @xmath39{gev}$ ] and @xmath38{tev}$ ] , and @xmath31 varies between 2 and 50 .",
    "the relations between the parameters are further restricted by the condition @xmath40{gev } < m_{\\rm color}^{\\rm max } + \\unit[100]{gev } \\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath41 being the maximum slepton soft mass , @xmath42 being the maximum of @xmath43 and @xmath30 , and @xmath44 being the maximum soft mass or mass parameter of any color  charged superparticle .",
    "the constraints ( [ bound ] ) can be motivated by the fact that most models of supersymmetry breaking predict @xcite superparticles with non  vanishing color charge to be heavier than the color singlets .",
    "they also make it likely @xcite that sleptons can be produced in the decay of some color  charged superparticle , improving the chance that slepton masses can be determined experimentally .",
    "given the parameters of the ( weak  scale ) mssm lagrangian , we compute the supersymmetric spectrum with the program softsusy @xcite .",
    "next , the branching ratios of kinematically allowed decays are computed using susy  hit @xcite .",
    "signal events are then generated with the event generator herwig++ @xcite .",
    "we first generate 10,000 events to determine the total cross section for the production of superparticles , and then generate the number of events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath2{fb^{-1}}$ ] of data at @xmath45{tev}$ ] .",
    "we include full qcd showering as well as interactions between spectator partons , using default values of the corresponding parameters . since all cross sections are calculated in leading order ( lo ) in qcd , we use lo parton distribution functions cteq6.6 @xcite .",
    "we do not attempt any detailed detector modeling .",
    "we do not expect experimental resolutions to be very important for us , since most of the observables we employ are counting observables , which should be relatively insensitive to resolution effects .",
    "acceptances ( both in pseudorapidity and transverse momentum ) are included in our definitions of observable leptons and jets , as described in appendix a. moreover , we assume that hadronically decaying @xmath16leptons as well as @xmath15jets can be tagged with @xmath46{\\%}$ ] probability within their respective acceptance windows",
    ". we do not include false positive tags . within the mssm ,",
    "all flavors of quarks and leptons are produced with comparable probabilities , so mis  tagging is not likely to significantly affect the distinction between different parameter sets , which is at the focus of our analysis .",
    "in this section we describe how we compare parameter sets . to this end",
    "we construct a total @xmath0 distribution , which allows us to compute a @xmath47value , which in turn is used to quantify how similar two parameter sets appear .",
    "this is described in the last subsection .",
    "the first subsection discusses the observables we use to construct the overall @xmath0 , and the second subsection describes the calculation of the covariance matrix for these observables .",
    "if two different parameter choices yield exactly the same values for all conceivable observables , then there would be no chance to distinguish between these parameter sets . in principle",
    "this should not happen for the 15 parameter mssm we are considering , since each parameter affects the mass , production cross section and/or decay branching ratios of at least one superparticle .",
    "however , while masses , cross sections and branching ratios formally are all observables , it is not clear whether they affect quantities that can actually be measured by lhc experiments sufficiently strongly to allow determination of the corresponding parameters from lhc data .",
    "moreover , it is possible that the values of two or more parameters can be varied simultaneously such that no lhc observable is changed significantly .    chosing the right set of observables",
    "is a quite non  trivial task . on general grounds",
    "one expects that one needs at least one observable for each free parameter whose value one wishes to determine .",
    "supersymmetric extensions of the sm are notorious for allowing many possible signatures @xcite ; however , not all signatures are viable for all combinations of parameters .",
    "this argues for using not too few observables , in order to make sure that one is sensitive to all parameters everywhere in parameter space .",
    "conversely , an observable should show non  trivial dependence on at least one of the free parameters in order to be useful .",
    "if we combine all observables into a single quantity , adding observables with little or no discriminatory power can dilute the effect of those observables that are sensitive to some parameters , reducing the statistical power of the test .    another argument against simply using `` all '' observables , as ( essentially ) done by arkani ",
    "hamed et al .",
    "@xcite , is that this makes it difficult to determine a priori the statistical correlations between the observables . since our method of comparing parameter sets",
    "is based on an overall @xmath0 variable , we need the full covariance matrix between all observables , including all correlations . for example , consider two observables which are correlated and we do not take that into account . if we now compare two different parameter sets and the observables used for the comparison are positively correlated ( i.e. , one tends to become smaller if the other one does , and vice versa ) , the parameter sets can look more similar than they actually are . on the contrary , if these observables are anticorrelated , ignoring this correlation would lead us to over  estimate the difference between the compared parameter sets .",
    "in fact , including an observable which is strongly ( anti)correlated with another observable does not increase the actual amount of information by much , and hence does not significantly improve our chance to discriminate between different sets of parameters.{\\%}$ ] correlation between two ( linear combinations of ) observables .",
    "this would lead to a divergence of the inverse correlation matrix @xmath48 , because one eigenvalue of @xmath49 would be zero .",
    "this divergence can be removed by removing one of the observables from the covariance matrix .",
    "an actual example of this will be described later in this section . ] thus using more observables does not automatically improve the results of a parameter set comparison .    as mentioned in the introduction , computing the statistical correlation between a large number of kinematical observables constructed from the same set of events is difficult .",
    "we therefore use mostly counting observables , with a single kinematical observable per class of events .",
    "the production of the heavier superparticles can trigger quite lengthy decay cascades @xcite , leading to events with several jets and/or charged leptons . if we classified all events simply by the number ( e.g. 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 and more ) , charge and flavor of charged leptons we would already have @xmath50 classes of events .",
    "if we defined additional sub  classes according to the number of non@xmath51jets ( e.g. 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 and more ) and the number of @xmath51jets ( e.g. 0 , 1 or 2 and more ) we would end up with @xmath52 different classes . even adding a single kinematical observable for each class would double the total number of observables considered .",
    "this large number of observables does not seem to be practical .",
    "for one thing , our event sample consists of typically 25,000 events after cuts , so most of the classes would be empty .",
    "instead we consider 84 independent observables .",
    "the first one is the total number of events after cuts .",
    "since nearly all parameter sets include a stable neutralino as lsp eigenstate ; even the set of `` degenerate pairs '' contains such examples .",
    "scenarios with stable or long  lived charged slepton as lsp would be trivial to distinguish from parameter sets where the lsp is a neutralino , using stable charged particle searches .",
    "we find that all scenarios where the lsp is not a neutralino can be distinguished from all other scenarios even when only using our standard observables listed below .",
    "( in all pairs of parameter sets we compare , at least one lsp is the lightest neutralino ) . ]",
    ", we always require a sizable missing @xmath53 , which greatly suppresses sm backgrounds .",
    "the details of the cuts depend on the number of charged leptons ( meaning electrons , muons and tagged hadronically decaying taus ) , as described in appendix [ sec : eventcuts ] . on average around @xmath54{\\%}$ ] of all supersymmetric events pass these cuts and we only consider those events in the following .",
    "we divide the surviving events into twelve mutually exclusive classes depending on the number , charge and flavor of the measured `` stable '' charged leptons ( @xmath55 or @xmath56 ; @xmath16leptons decay within the detector and are thus non  trivial to identify experimentally ) .",
    "note that we only include isolated electrons and muons with pseudorapidity @xmath57 and transverse momentum @xmath58{gev}$ ] , as described in appendix a.  1 .",
    "the twelve classes of events are :    * @xmath59 : events with no charged leptons * @xmath60 : events with exactly one charged lepton , with negative charge * @xmath61 : events with exactly one charged lepton , with positive charge * @xmath62 : events with exactly two charged leptons , with total charge @xmath63 ( in units of the proton charge ) * @xmath64 : events with exactly two charged leptons , with total charge @xmath65 * @xmath66 : events with exactly two charged leptons , with opposite charge but the same flavor ; i.e. @xmath67 or @xmath68 * @xmath69 : events with exactly two charged leptons with opposite charge and different flavor ; i.e. @xmath70 or @xmath71 * @xmath72 : events with exactly three charged leptons with total charge @xmath73 . there is an opposite  charged lepton pair with same flavor . for example @xmath74 or @xmath75 * @xmath76 : events with exactly three charged leptons with total charge @xmath77 .",

    "; there is thus little sense in trying to distinguish between electrons and muons .",
    "we do , however , distinguish between positively and negatively charged leptons . since the initial state at the lhc is not cp self  conjugate , there is no reason to assume that @xmath87 and @xmath88 will be produced with equal rate . and",
    "@xmath89 decay , and negative leptons from @xmath90 and @xmath91 decays . in the absence of",
    "cp violation a sizable charge asymmetry @xcite can only result from first generation squarks , since squarks of higher generations will always be created as squark ",
    "antisquark pairs . in case of the first generation , essentially only @xmath92 doublet squarks can decay into charginos .",
    "the charge asymmetry is therefore obviously sensitive to the difference between the masses of @xmath93 and @xmath94  but these masses are related by @xmath92 invariance @xcite , and can be taken as equal as far as lhc experiments are concerned .",
    "the charge asymmetry will nevertheless be sensitive to the ratio of squark and gluino masses .",
    "moreover , the branching ratios of @xmath93 and @xmath94 will have slightly different dependencies on the parameters of the chargino sector .",
    "] moreover , pairs of charged leptons with opposite charge but the same flavor can originate from the decay of a single neutralino , @xmath95 with @xmath96 ; all other pairs of charged leptons must come from the decays of two different ( super)particles . in events containing a pair of oppositely charged leptons it therefore makes sense to distinguish pairs with equal flavor from those with different flavor",
    ". however , since events with four or more charged leptons are very rare , we do not attempt to subdivide them any further .    for each of these twelve classes @xmath97 we save seven observables @xmath98 :    * @xmath99 : the number of events @xmath100 contained in the given class @xmath101 divided by the total number of events @xmath102 , i.e. the fraction of all events contained in a given class * @xmath103 : the number of events in a given class @xmath101 that contain at least one tagged hadronically decaying @xmath104 divided by the total number of events in this class * @xmath105 : the number of events in a given class @xmath101 that contain at least one tagged hadronically decaying @xmath106 divided by the total number of events in this class * @xmath107 : the number of events in a given class @xmath101 that contain at least one tagged @xmath15jet divided by the total number of events in this class * @xmath108 : average number of non@xmath109jets of all events within a given class @xmath101 * @xmath110 : average of the square of the number of non@xmath109jets of all events within a given class @xmath101 in the given class contains @xmath111 non@xmath15jets , then @xmath112 . ]",
    "* @xmath113 : average value of @xmath114 of all events within a given class @xmath101 , where @xmath114 is the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all hard objects , including the missing @xmath115    jets are reconstructed using the anti@xmath116 scheme of fastjet @xcite .",
    "they have to satisfy @xmath117{gev}$ ] and @xmath118 ; @xmath15tagging is possible only for jets with @xmath119 that contain at least one ( decay product of a ) @xmath15flavored hadron .",

    "see appendix a for further details .",
    "since we use only a single kinematical observable for each class , and the classes are all mutually exclusive , we do not have to deal with correlations between different kinematical observables .",
    "note the difference between observables 2 , 3 and 4 on the one hand , and 5 and 6 on the other .",
    "the former three observables essentially count all events that contain at least one object of the given type , while the latter count the ( square of the ) number of jets per event . at least for the parameter sets considered here , the number of events containing a tagged @xmath121 or @xmath15jet is usually small , and the number of events containing two or more such tagged objects is even smaller ; it is therefore sufficient to simply count the number of events that contain at least one such object.quarks will nearly always occur in quark ",
    "antiquark pairs , but the probability that both members of such pairs are not only taggable , but also tagged is rather low . also , precisely",
    "because @xmath15quarks almost always occur in pairs distinguishing between events with one or two @xmath15tags adds additional information only if there is a significant number of events with more than one @xmath122 pair in the final state ; such events are very rare in our scenarios . ] in contrast , most events do contain several jets .",
    "we therefore use two different observables to characterize the distribution in the number of jets in the different event classes .      in order to perform a statistical analysis using these observables",
    "we need their full covariance matrix , including all correlations .",
    "this subsection contains expressions for all non  vanishing entries of this matrix .",
    "the first observable was the total number of events after cuts , @xmath102 ; its variance is simply given by @xmath123    the next twelve observables are the fractions of events @xmath124 that belong to each class @xmath101 .",
    "these twelve observables are not independent , since @xmath125 , i.e. the fractions add up to unity .",
    "this difficulty could be avoided by simply using the twelve @xmath100 as variables , which are not correlated , and dropping the total number of events @xmath102 .",
    "the reason why we include @xmath102 and the @xmath124 is that we will later assign a much smaller systematical error on the event _ fractions _",
    "@xmath124 than on the total number of events @xmath102 .",
    "note also that the event fractions @xmath124 are not correlated with the total number of events @xmath102 , i.e. @xmath126 on the other hand , the covariance between the fraction of events in two different classes @xmath101 and @xmath127 is nonzero : @xmath128 the covariance for identical classes ( @xmath129 ) equals the variance , i.e. the usual error on the fraction of events in this class . the covariance matrix consisting of the twelve entries constructed according to eq.([equ : ccc ] ) is not invertible , because the rows and columns are linearly dependent .",
    "this is a consequence of the constraint @xmath130 mentioned above .",
    "in fact , it should be clear that it is impossible to create 13 independent observables @xmath124 and @xmath102 out of twelve measured event numbers @xmath100 .",
    "the solution of this problem is to exclude one @xmath124 with @xmath131 from our list of observables , and hence from the covariance matrix .",
    "so at the end we are left with 84 observables carrying different information instead of 85 .",

    "this can be seen from the fact that the resulting @xmath47value from a single comparison of these classes , computed according to eqs.([equ : p ] ) and ( [ equ : f ] ) , would take mostly two discrete values , as can be seen from the following calculation : @xmath166^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\    & \\approx & \\frac{(n_{c,\\tau^-}^a - n_{c,\\tau^-}^b)^2}{n_{c , a}^2 } \\cdot   \\frac{n_{c , a}^2}{n_{c,\\tau^-}^a + n_{c,\\tau^-}^b } \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\frac{(n_{c,\\tau^-}^a - n_{c,\\tau^-}^b)^2}{n_{c,\\tau^-}^a + n_{c,\\tau^-}^b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath150 and @xmath155 refer to the two data sets , which have been generated using the same parameter set , and @xmath101 refers to one of our twelve event classes .",

    "the bias towards large @xmath47values shows that the compared pairs of data sets are more similar than expected if @xmath189 and @xmath190 were independent .",

    "we do not bother to do that since this will not change the statistical distinguishability of two parameter sets significantly .",

    "[ fig : p_ntau ] .",
    "they follow an overall flat distribution , except for peaks at certain positions .",

    "[ fig : p_ntau ] are slightly smaller than 3305 . of course ,",

    "note also that these unwarranted peaks are due to data sets containing very few identified @xmath16leptons . in these cases",
    "the @xmath121 observables do not contribute very much to our total @xmath157 , and hence do not affect the calculation of the overall @xmath47value very much .",
    "we checked that the remaining five kinds of observables have flat distributions ( not shown ) once the conditions summarized in table  [ tab : nmin ] have been applied .",
    "this justifies our choice of @xmath175 values that define when a given observable is considered relevant .",

    "around 40 out of 84 observables are compared for each pair of data sets .",
    "the flat shape confirms our calculation method of @xmath157 , including the calculation of the covariance matrix as described in subsection  [ sec : matrix ] .",
    "it also confirms our expectation that the anomalies we found above in the @xmath47value distributions for the total number of events after cuts and for the @xmath121 observables do not distort the overall @xmath47value significantly .",
    "we also performed a second kind of statistical test , using the 384 parameter sets that contain the indistinguishable pairs found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we again performed two simulations for each parameter set , one corresponding to the nominal luminosity of @xmath2{fb^{-1}}$ ] , and one with ten times more events .",
    "the first simulation defines the `` measurements '' , while the second simulation was used to determine the true expectation values of our observables , since their ( statistical ) errors are much smaller than those of the `` measurements '' .",
    "we then checked whether the normalized differences between the `` measurements '' and their expectation values follow a student s @xmath205distribution , as they should if the `` measured '' observables obey gaussian statistics .",
    "these tests were also successful",
    ". however , they are somewhat less powerful , since our computer resources did not permit to generate the required large number of events for the larger number of parameter sets described earlier in this subsection .",
    "having verified that our variable @xmath157 behaves like a proper @xmath0 distribution under appropriate conditions , we are now ready to use it to analyze whether pairs of parameter sets can be distinguished by lhc experiments .",
    "our focus will be on pairs of parameter sets that arkani  hamed _ et al . _",
    "@xcite deemed to be indistinguishable .",
    "recall that they found 283 such pairs formed from 384 different sets of parameters .    as mentioned in the introduction , two parameter sets @xmath150 and",
    "@xmath155 can be considered distinguishable if a measurement can exclude the predictions made for parameter set @xmath155 , under the assumption that nature is described by parameter set @xmath150 , or vice versa . here",
    "the predictions yield the expectation values of our 84 observables , and do not have a true statistical uncertainty , given sufficiently large monte carlo statistics for the computation of these expectation values . given our limited computer resources , we computed the predictions using ten times more events than generated for the measurement ; this ensures that the monte carlo statistical uncertainty on the predictions is already almost negligible compared to the expected statistical uncertainty of the measurement , but we do take this uncertainty on the prediction into account .    in most cases it should not make a difference if the experiment is based on parameter set @xmath150 while the prediction is for parameter set @xmath155 or vice versa .",
    "this should only be important if the statistical errors ( for fixed integrated luminosity ) of @xmath150 and @xmath155 differ significantly .",
    "this can only happen if the predictions for @xmath150 and @xmath155 are quite different , in which case these parameter sets should be distinguishable anyway . in order to have a unique comparison rule we simply symmetrize the expression for the covariance matrix under the exchange of @xmath150 and @xmath155 ,",
    "i.e. we take the average of the covariance matrix that results when measurements based on @xmath150 are compared to predictions based on @xmath155 and the covariance matrix that describes the difference between measurements based on @xmath155 and predictions based on @xmath150 : @xmath206 here the subscripts @xmath207 and @xmath208 refer to data sets corresponding to integrated luminosities of @xmath2{fb^{-1}}$ ] for the measurement and @xmath37{fb^{-1}}$ ] for the prediction . the first term in eq.([equ : v_final ] ) therefore describes the ( expected ) statistical uncertainties associated with the measurements , while the second term comes from the uncertainty on the predictions due to finite ( although large ) monte carlo statistics .",
    "finally , the last term describes systematic uncertainties , which we assume to contribute only to the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix .",
    "we assume that the systematic uncertainty for a given observable @xmath209 is some fixed fraction @xmath210 of this observable .",
    "this is the usual ansatz at least for systematic theoretical uncertainties ; experimental systematic errors also tend to decrease with increasing luminosity . our numerical choices for the @xmath210 will be discussed below .",
    "when calculating the total @xmath157 from eq.([equ : chi2ab ] ) , and the corresponding @xmath47value from eqs.([equ : p ] ) and ( [ equ : f ] ) , we again only include relevant observables , defined exactly as in subsection  [ sec : teststat ] .",
    "for the 283 pairs found indistinguishable in ref.@xcite , we find that on average 32 observables are included in the comparison .",
    "recall that about 40 observables were included in the self  comparison described in the subsection  [ sec : teststat ] .",
    "this is expected , since for most observables _ both _ data sets have to contain a minimal number of events of a given type for a certain observable to be included , as detailed in table  [ tab : nmin ] . if two different parameter sets are compared it is more likely that one of the sets does not satisfy this criterion , thereby reducing the number of observables we use .    on average about @xmath211 events pass all our cuts , for a cut efficiency of about @xmath54{\\%}$ ] . in most cases a large majority of these events again contains no or only one isolated charged lepton ( electron or muon ) , i.e. the bulk of events belongs to the first three classes described in subsection  [ sec : observables ] .    in the following three subsections we present results for four different assumptions regarding systematic errors and standard model backgrounds .",
    "our first result is that in an ideal world , where the standard model background as well as all systematic errors can be neglected , _ all _ of the 283 degenerate pairs are distinguishable , i.e. lead to a @xmath47value below @xmath212 ; the mean @xmath47value of these 283 pairs is @xmath213 .",

    "clearly in the limit @xmath229 the two parameter sets @xmath150 and @xmath155 become identical , and hence indistinguishable .",

    "we remind the readers that all our parameter sets have relatively light superparticles , not much above the tev scale , so the total rate of susy events is significant .",
    "recall also that _ all _ pairs of parameter sets we are considering here were considered indistinguishable by arkani ",
    "hamed et al . , including parameter sets with relatively large @xmath220 .",
    "as noted above , our analysis shows that most of these pairs can in fact be distinguished .    in the right frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaptot ] , which uses a logarithmic scale for the @xmath47value , the lower edge of the populated region includes smaller @xmath230 for larger @xmath47values , which conforms with naive expectations .",

    "this can e.g. happen if a small variation of some mass opens or closes some decay channel characterized by large couplings and hence potentially large branching ratios , which will significantly alter the final state of many susy events .",
    "the main conclusion therefore is that there is relatively little correlation between the @xmath47value and the average parameter difference @xmath220 computed from all 15 input parameters .                    in order to gain a better understanding of this result ,",

    "most pairs of parameter sets with @xmath217 also have quite similar values of these latter parameters , but there are a few outliers .",
    "this is due to the fact that our counting observables are mostly sensitive to the ordering of the three electroweak gaugino  higgsino mass parameters .",
    "for example , reducing the smallest of these parameters even more may have little impact on branching ratios , and may not change our sole kinematic quantity @xmath114 very much as long as the lightest neutralino remains sufficiently light .",
    "conversely , if the bino mass is larger than the gluino mass and also larger than the masses of the sleptons , few bino  like neutralinos will be produced at the lhc , so that @xmath236 can not be determined very well by lhc experiments .",
    "the two points with @xmath237 and @xmath238 in the two upper frames of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltapino ] correspond to the same pair of parameters . here",
    "the values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are ( approximately ) interchanged between the two sets .",
    "the existence of such `` mirror pairs '' has also been noticed in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that there is a strong hierarchy between these two parameters in both cases ; moreover , @xmath30 is quite large . as a result ,",
    "basically only the lightest neutralino is produced in lhc events , irrespective of the ordering of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the scenario with @xmath239 , the lightest chargino",
    "is also produced frequently ; however , since its mass splitting to the lightest neutralino is only @xmath240 mev , the lighter chargino effectively behaves like the lightest neutralino in this scenario , as far as our observables are concerned .",
    "figure  [ fig : deltapsfermion ] shows results for sfermion mass parameters . in the left frame the sum in eq.([equ : dp2 ] ) runs over the six squark mass parameters of our model .",
    "we see that the squark masses differ relatively little within pairs of parameter sets with @xmath241 , although the spread is significantly larger than for the gluino mass ( up to about @xmath242{\\%}$ ] as compared to up to about @xmath233{\\%}$ ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the cross section for producing a single type of squark is much smaller than the cross section for gluino pair production , for equal masses ; this is true in particular for second and third generation squarks , for which no @xmath205 or @xmath243channel processes involving two valence ( @xmath244 or @xmath245 ) quarks in the initial state are available .",
    "moreover , one can again set up `` mirror pairs '' , e.g. by swapping the masses of @xmath92 doublet ( @xmath246type ) and singlet ( @xmath247type ) squarks if all squarks decay directly into the lightest neutralino .    the right frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltapsfermion ] shows corresponding results for the slepton mass parameters .",
    "evidently parameter pairs with @xmath217 can have quite different slepton masses .",
    "the observables we are using are sensitive to slepton masses essentially only if sleptons are produced in the decays of strongly interacting sparticles . while the conditions ( [ bound ] ) make it likely that such decays are kinematically possible for some strongly interacting sparticle(s ) , they by no means ensure that the corresponding cross section times branching ratio is sizable .",
    "in particular , we saw above that bino  like neutralinos may be produced very rarely at the lhc .",
    "if in addition the wino  like states are lighter than the sleptons , very few sleptons will be produced in the decays of gluinos and squarks , and our observables will not be sensitive to slepton masses .    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaptanb ] shows that @xmath248 has the largest spread among all our parameters , even when only pairs of parameter sets with @xmath217 are considered . in principle",
    "this parameter has influence on many observables , since it appears in the chargino and neutralino mass matrices and also affects all sfermion masses .",
    "however , in most cases the dependence of the physical masses and couplings on this parameter is weak .",
    "it can be enhanced if two charginos or two neutralinos are close in mass , or if @xmath248 is very large , in which case it modifies @xmath249 and @xmath250 mixing significantly .",
    "we next include standard model backgrounds , which had been ignored in ref .",
    "we include backgrounds from @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 as well as single top production ; the latter is generated using the programs madgraph 5 @xcite and herwig++ , and the other backgrounds are simulated directly using herwig++ .",
    "for the first two backgrounds , only leptonic @xmath254 and @xmath255 decays are included , which have a chance to pass our cut on the missing transverse momentum . and @xmath254 , respectively , of @xmath37{gev}$ ] at the parton level , i.e. prior to showering .",
    "this has little influence on the total number of events which pass the cuts because events with lower parton  level transverse momentum have almost no chance to pass our missing @xmath115 cut . ]",
    "all background ( and signal ) contributions are only considered to leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "altogether we find @xmath256 background events after cuts for a data sample of @xmath2{fb^{-1}}$ ] , yielding a signal to background ratio of very roughly 1 to 1 .",
    "we add these to all our `` measurement '' samples .",
    "an independent background simulation for @xmath37{fb^{-1}}$ ] of data yielded @xmath257 events after cuts , which we add to our `` prediction '' samples .",
    "the biggest source of background is top pair production , followed by the production of a @xmath254 or @xmath255 boson in association with several jets . of course , the background is also included in the calculation of the covariance matrix .",
    "recall that a given observable is only included in the calculation of the overall @xmath157 if the corresponding event class contains a minimal number of signal events , as listed in table  [ tab : nmin ] .",
    "we now demand instead that there should be a susy signal of at least @xmath258 statistical significance for an observable to be considered relevant , i.e. we only include observables if the number of supersymmetric events in the corresponding class is greater or equal three times the square  root of the number of background events . in case of the event fractions in a given event class @xmath177 , this requirement has to be satisfied for at least one of the two pairs of parameters in a given comparison ; all other observables are included only if this new requirement is satisfied for both pairs of parameters .    including these backgrounds , but ignoring all systematic errors leads to only one parameter pair with @xmath217 .",
    "however , including systematic errors as well as sm backgrounds increases the number of pairs that can not be distinguished `` at @xmath4{\\%}$ ] confidence level '' to 46 .",
    "this means that our simple algorithm can resolve more than @xmath259{\\%}$ ] of the `` degenerate pairs '' found by arkani ",
    "hamed et al .",
    ", even after sm backgrounds are included .",
    "in this paper we investigated the question to which extent a single @xmath0 variable can be used to discriminate between different parameter sets in a general mssm with 15 free parameters .",
    "this analysis was triggered by ref.@xcite , which identified 283 pairs of parameter sets that were claimed to be indistinguishable by lhc experiments with @xmath2{fb^{-1}}$ ] of data taken at @xmath156{tev}$ ] . in our analysis",
    "we used far fewer observables ( up to 84 , as compared to up to 1808 ) , but took care to properly include all correlations , so that our @xmath157 defined in eq.([equ : chi2ab ] ) should behave like a proper @xmath0 distribution in the limit of gaussian statistics ; we checked this explicitly in sec .",
    "[ sec : teststat ] .",
    "we saw in the introduction that this does not seem to be true for the `` @xmath6like '' variable considered in ref .",
    "we also improved the analysis by including initial state showering and the underlying event when simulating our signal events .",
    "we also analyzed the effects of standard model backgrounds .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : results ]    our results are summarized in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "we see that under the conditions of ref.@xcite ( with systematic errors but without backgrounds ) all but 23 of the supposedly 283 indistinguishable pairs of parameters can in fact be distinguished at the @xmath4{\\%}$ ] confidence level .",
    "the median @xmath47value for all 283 pairs is then of order @xmath260 .",
    "including also sm backgrounds increases the number of pairs with @xmath217 to 46 , and the median @xmath47value increases by a factor @xmath261  but it still remains very small , of order @xmath262 .",
    "we therefore conclude that our analysis strategy can greatly alleviate the `` inverse problem '' at the lhc .",
    "this table also indicates that the inclusion of systematic uncertainties has a bigger impact than the inclusion of sm backgrounds .",
    "this is somewhat worrisome , since our ansatz for the systematic errors is quite ad hoc .",
    "experimental systematic errors can only be estimated properly by our experimental colleagues .",
    "the rather small total systematic errors we include can only be realized once quantum corrections to all relevant cross sections and branching ratios have been computed .",
    "we are confident that this will happen if and when superparticles are discovered ; in this we are encouraged by a very recent nnlo calculation of the cross section for @xmath263 production from @xmath264 annihilation @xcite , which reduces the higher order uncertainty , estimated by varying unphysical factorization and renormalization scales , to a value below @xmath265{\\%}$ ] .",
    "recall also that all sparticles have masses at or below @xmath38{tev}$ ] in the parameter sets considered in ref.@xcite , leading to quite large event samples at the lhc ; this reduces the importance of backgrounds . as noted earlier ,",
    "many of these spectra are most likely excluded by existing lhc searches ; we nevertheless used them in our analysis to ensure that our results can be compared directly with those of ref.@xcite .    while we consider our results to be quite encouraging , we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : delp ] that in some cases our observables can not discriminate between sets where at least some of the input parameters differ quite significantly , even if backgrounds are ignored .",
    "the pairs with @xmath217 and the largest overall difference between input parameters , measured via the quantity @xmath220 introduced in eq.([equ : dp2 ] ) , all have squark and gluino masses near the upper end of the scanned range , i.e. relatively low sparticle production cross sections and hence relatively small event samples .",
    "moreover , they all have wino mass @xmath266 , i.e. a light wino  like lightest chargino with small mass splitting to the neutralino .",
    "in fact , the mass splitting is @xmath267 $ \\sim$}}~}200 $ ] mev , giving macroscopic decay length for the lightest chargino @xcite",
    ". a measurement of this decay length would give an additional constraint on our input parameters .",
    "for example , it would break the degeneracy between pairs that basically only differ by @xmath268 ; see the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltapino ] .",
    "similarly , we have not tried to isolate certain supersymmetric production channels .",
    "our cuts have been devised solely with the purpose of suppressing sm backgrounds ; no attempt has been made to suppress `` supersymmetric backgrounds '' to certain channels .",
    "for example , direct slepton pair production might be detectable at the lhc under certain circumstances @xcite .",
    "this should help to resolve at least some of our degeneracies .",
    "note also that our simulation does not include mixed @xmath269 contributions to squark production cross sections , which are mostly due to interference between qcd diagrams and diagrams where an electroweak gaugino is exchanged in the @xmath205 or @xmath243channel .",
    "these contributions can change some squark pair cross sections by tens of percent @xcite , thereby offering another handle on the electroweak gaugino masses ; they can also help to discriminate between @xmath92 singlet and doublet squarks , which can be difficult if only a single neutralino state is accessible to squark and gluino decays .",
    "finally , we have not seriously attempted to optimize the cuts , or the selection of observables , with a view of improve the distinguishability between pairs of parameter sets .",
    "we feel that this can be done in a meaningful manner only if many more than the 283 pairs of parameter sets we are studying are analyzed , which unfortunately is beyond the power of our computer resources .",
    "besides , given that the lhc is running and producing data , the usefulness of vast scans of parameter space for the purpose of optimizing methods to distinguish between discrete sets of input parameters appears somewhat questionable .",
    "instead the analysis presented here had two objectives .",
    "first , we wanted to alleviate concerns raised in ref.@xcite that lhc experiments may not be able to determine many susy parameters even if sparticles are quite light .",
    "as argued above , this goal was largely achieved .",
    "this indicates that our observables should also be useful for determining the values of supersymmetric parameters , rather than `` only '' for the purpose of discriminating between discrete sets of input parameters .",
    "our second goal is therefore to motivate further studies , where ( some of ) our observables are used to determine supersymmetric parameters , as alternative , or in addition , to the methods that have been used so far .",
    "we thank jesse thaler for providing the parameter sets analyzed by us .",
    "nb wants to thank the `` bonn - cologne graduate school of physics and astronomy '' and the `` universitt bonn '' for the financial support .",
    "this work was partially supported by the bmbf  theorieverbund and by the helmholtz alliance `` physics at the terascale '' .",
    "in this appendix we describe in detail how our observables are defined .",
    "in particular , charged leptons and jets have to fulfill certain acceptance cuts to be counted .",
    "the @xmath16jets which arise from hadronically decaying @xmath16leptons are in general just called taus here .",
    "the determination of @xmath15 and non@xmath109jets is also explained in the following .",
    "the final subsections deal with the calculation of the missing transverse momentum @xmath270 and the observable @xmath114 .",
    "note that we count visible particles as measurable only if they have pseudorapidity @xmath271 ; neutrinos and the lightest neutralino are not considered visible , since they ( usually ) do not interact in the detector .",
    "we only consider _ isolated _ electrons and muons , i.e. a charged lepton @xmath272 has to fulfill the following criteria :    * @xmath273 * @xmath274{gev } $ ] * for all measurable particles with @xmath275 the transverse energy @xmath53 is summed .",
    "this sum has to be @xmath276{gev}$ ]      only hadronically decaying taus , i.e. @xmath16jets , are considered here ; the electrons and muons produced in leptonic @xmath121 decays are counted as all other charged leptons , if they satisfy the criteria listed in the previous subsection .",
    "we use generator information to check whether a given @xmath16lepton indeed decays hadronically .",
    "the four  momentum @xmath277 of the @xmath16jet is then defined as the difference between the four  momentum of the parent @xmath16lepton and the four  momentum of the corresponding @xmath278 .",
    "we impose the following acceptance cuts on the @xmath16jets :    * @xmath279 * @xmath280{gev } $ ]    furthermore the @xmath16jet should be isolated , i.e. there must not be any charged hadrons with @xmath281{gev}$ ] and no photons with @xmath282{gev}$ ] within a cone @xmath283 around the tau ; note that this condition is usually more stringent than that used for electrons and muons .",
    "moreover , a @xmath16jet satisfying all conditions is only tagged with a @xmath46{\\%}$ ] probability .",
    "recall also that some @xmath284{\\%}$ ] of all @xmath16leptons decay leptonically .",
    "altogether we thus see that a sample of events containing equal numbers of electrons , muons and @xmath16leptons with identical kinematical distributions would indeed yield equal numbers of observed electrons and muons in our simulation , but far fewer identified @xmath16leptons .",
    "note finally that identified @xmath16jets are not included in the identification of other jets .",
    "jets are determined with the program fastjet @xcite using the anti@xmath285 algorithm .",
    "all measurable particles are taken into account , except for isolated electrons and muons that satisfy the criteria of subsec .",

    "in particular , the products of multiple @xmath15hadrons could end up in one jet , which is not unlikely if the two corresponding @xmath15quark momenta are nearly parallel to each other . in principle the decay products of one @xmath15hadron could end up in multiple jets , but this happens only rarely . finally , a @xmath15jet is only tagged with a @xmath46{\\%}$ ] probability .",

    "<S> the lhc inverse problem refers to the difficulties in determining the parameters of an underlying theory from data ( to be ) taken by the lhc experiments : if they find signals of new physics , and an underlying theory is assumed , could its parameters be determined uniquely , or do different parameter choices give indistinguishable experimental signatures ? </S>",
    "<S> this inverse problem was studied before for a supersymmetric standard model with 15 free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this earlier study found 283 indistinguishable pairs of parameter choices , called degenerate pairs , even if backgrounds are ignored . </S>",
    "<S> we can resolve all but 23 of those pairs by constructing a true @xmath0 distribution using mostly counting observables . </S>",
    "<S> the elimination of systematic errors would even allow separating the residual degeneracies . </S>",
    "<S> taking the standard model background into account we still can resolve 237 of the 283 `` degenerate '' pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that ( some of ) our observables should also be useful for the purpose of determining the values of susy parameters .    </S>",
