    "such a lattice has natural open boundaries along the spin direction at @xmath146 ( where @xmath147 is the lattice spacing ) , while @xmath129 can be arbitrarily large . in this appendix",
    ", we illustrate how the edge - state properties discussed in the main text can be related to the topological band structure and chiral edge states of the standard hofstadter square lattice  @xcite , namely , a square lattice of @xmath148 sites , with @xmath149 , subjected to a uniform magnetic flux @xmath150 per plaquette .",
    "the number of lattice sites along the @xmath151 direction is denoted @xmath80 , so as to refer to the width of the stripe .",
    "to do so , we consider an extrapolation between the hofstadter lattice ( size @xmath148 ) and the thin stripe considered in the main text ( size @xmath144 ) , by progressively reducing the number of lattice sites along the @xmath151 direction @xmath80 , while applying periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath50 direction , see fig .",

    "the many bulk states progressively disappear , as the number of inequivalent lattice sites is reduced to @xmath155 , while the dispersion branches of the edge states are only slightly modified .",

    "therefore , we can conclude that the edge - state structure present in the double - ladder lattice ( @xmath159 ) is reminiscent of the chiral ( topological ) edge states present in the standard hofstadter square lattice ( see also ref .   for a detailed study of the hofstadter ladder with @xmath161 corresponding to @xmath62 ) .    , and definition of the color code : dark blue ( resp .",
