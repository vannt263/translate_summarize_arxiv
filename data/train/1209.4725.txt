    "the concept of the feshbach resonance developed in the theory of nuclear reactions @xcite plays a significant role in studies of atomic collisions with formation of a bound state ( molecule ) which is important for understanding the processes in the quantum systems of bose einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "this causes a great number of investigations in the topic ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "feshbach resonance is displayed when the energy of a bound molecular state in the closed channel is almost equal to the energy of two colliding atoms in the open channel in the center - of - mass system . in this case",
    "weak coupling may lead to strong mixing of the channels .",
    "intermediate quasibound state of colliding atoms is formed in the open channel .",
    "this state has a finite lifetime and can decay into the initial channel or into other channels via interaction with continuum .",
    "the energy difference may , in particular , be controlled by means of a magnetic field .",
    "when the bound state in the closed channel has a different hyperfine state than the incoming atoms in the open channel , coupling between these channels is provided by the exchange interaction .",
    "this difference in the hyperfine states results in that the two channels have different zeeman shifts in the magnetic field , therefore the energy difference between the bound state in closed channel and the two - atom scattering state in open channel is adjustable by tuning the magnetic field .",
    "this leads to the magnetically tuned feshbach resonance .",
    "feshbach resonance has experimentally been observed in bec ( optically trapped sodium atoms ) in work @xcite .",
    "elastic and inelastic collisions of ultracold atoms and molecules in a magnetic field are considered in @xcite . in works",
    "@xcite also the dependence of the scattering length on the magnetic field is obtained .",
    "work @xcite considers conditions for obtaining two - atom molecules in bec of @xmath0rb atoms in a harmonic trap and external time - dependent magnetic field .",
    "properties of feshbach resonances arising in collisions of ultracold atoms of @xmath1li , @xmath2li , and @xmath3na are studied in @xcite . for independent control of scattering parameters ( of ultracold atoms ) ,",
    "in particular , phase shift and effective range of action , work @xcite employs combination of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "studies of feshbach resonances with large background scattering length are performed in work @xcite .",
    "the developed model is applied to @xmath4rb atoms having large background scattering length and it is shown that there is a good agreement with coupled - channel calculations and that the model can be used for other atomic systems , such as @xmath5li and @xmath6cs , which have large background scattering length @xcite .",
    "full description of magnetically tuned feshbach resonances is given in works @xcite along with extensive literature on the question .",
    "in resonant collisions of atoms , it is of great importance to obtain stable molecules .",
    "this problem is solved experimentally in @xcite where an ensemble of feshbach molecules of @xmath0rb@xmath7 in optical lattice is transferred coherently into the lower bound molecular state by means of stirap ( stimulated rapid adiabatic passage ) technique @xcite .",
    "work @xcite discusses the stirap transfer ( with two laser pulses ) of resonantly colliding sodium atoms from the magnetically tuned feshbach - resonance state into the lower molecular stable state .    in case where magnetically tunable resonances are absent , an alternative method for control of feshbach resonance is the optical method @xcite ( optical feshbach resonance ) . from the point of view of study of feshbach resonance , formation of a quasibound ( molecular ) state in laser radiation field",
    "is of considerable interest .",
    "photoassociation under action of laser radiation theoretically was studied in @xcite for realization of transition from unbound atoms into the bound molecular state . in work",
    "@xcite was shown that photoabsorption of ultracold atoms depends on the sign and value of the scattering length in scattering of two atoms .",
    "the changes in fluorescence from @xmath8li provides information on signs of the scattering length in the triplet and singlet states .",
    "control of feshbach resonances by means of quantum interference was proposed in work @xcite .",
    "quasibound states in feshbach resonance formed under action of electromagnetic field are coupled with other states , which also can , in general , decay into other continuum .",
    "optical tuning of the scattering length in low - temperature atomic gases was considered in @xcite .",
    "it is shown in that work that electromagnetic radiation which is in resonance with the transition from the state of colliding atoms to a vibrational level of excited electronic state induced by feshbach resonance modifies the scattering length of atoms ; this is illustrated for @xmath2li atoms .",
    "optical tuning of scattering length was studied in @xcite for bec of @xmath0rb atoms .",
    "control of power and detuning of laser beam enabled to vary in wide range the scattering length .",
    "formation of ultracold molecules via photoassociation of laser - cooled atoms was studied in @xcite .",
    "study of influence of electromagnetic radiation on the scattering length and analytic consideration of two - color photoassociation and control of cold atoms were made in works @xcite .    in the theory of resonant collisions , in addition to feshbach method @xcite , which has been developed for studies of nuclear reactions and",
    "is applied successfully for collision of atoms in bec , an alternative fano approach @xcite exists exploiting the configuration interaction in multielectron atoms .",
    "both approaches assume appearance of resonance phenomena when discrete states are coupled with continuum .",
    "fano technique is usually associated with asymmetry of shapes of resonance lines which is known in atomic physics as `` fano profile '' .",
    "similar interference phenomena of asymmetry of the resonance line shape are also observed in nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "fano technique is , however , used not only in atomic physics for , e.g. , studies of autoionization and rydberg states @xcite , resonance ionization of atoms @xcite , and laser - induced continuum structures ( lics ) @xcite . the fano technique is also used for consideration of resonant collisions @xcite including those of electrons with atoms with formation of negative ions and interference phenomena in the field of laser radiation @xcite .",
    "fano technique is widely used in also other fields of physics .",
    "it is , e.g. , used for explanation of asymmetry in the absorption spectra of impurity ions in crystals , which is caused by formation of excitonic resonances @xcite . with use of these resonances",
    "work @xcite studies the phenomenon of storage and reconstruction of quantum information in solids .",

    "and we have a double - pole resonance . for revealing the double - peak in cross - sections of resonant scattering",
    "the condition latexmath:[\\[\\label{94 }    follows that at @xmath219 splitting effects are possible if the condition @xmath217 is met . under condition @xmath222",
    "we obtain from the expressions for cross - sections the well - known expressions for resonant scattering with an isolated level .",
    "we considered collision of two atoms with formation of feshbach resonance in the field of laser radiation .",
    "the interaction @xmath15 ( notation in the fig.1 and fig.2 ) between electronic states means such an interaction with the external magnetic field where the bound state in the closed channel and the states of colliding atoms in the open channel are different hyperfine states . in the absence of this interaction ,",
    "the quantity @xmath15 describes the weak interaction between the nuclear and electronic motions .",
    "taking into account these terms lead , by employing the theory of perturbation , to arising of transitions between different electronic states .    in this work",
    ", we examined the cases where laser radiation couples the lower molecular vibrational state in the open channel with higher - lying molecular state in the closed channel , by one - photon resonance interaction , and with atomic states in continuum , by interaction @xmath13 .",
    "resonant laser radiation forms , via autler - townes effect , dressed states which produce , by interaction with the magnetic field , the feshbach resonance .",
    "the interaction @xmath13 which couples low - lying vibrational state with atomic continuum produces , via autler - townes effect and lics , the laser - induced feshbach resonances .",
    "thus , we showed that combined effect of formation of feshbach resonances takes place under action of both magnetic field and laser radiation .",
    "this enables control of feshbach resonances by tuning both the magnetic field strength and the laser radiation frequency and power .",
    "in addition , the widths of resonances also depend on the magnetic field and laser intensity .",
    "the latter broadens the feshbach resonance facilitating considerably the experimental observation of asymmetry in the total scattering cross - section arising from interference between the resonance and potential scattering . as seen in the obtained plots for elastic scattering ( fig.3a , b ) , the resonance is sharper at higher values of the parameter @xmath155 . with the decrease in this parameter",
    "the resonance becomes flatter and at @xmath156 we observe an antiresonance , because of the interference between potential and resonant scattering .",
    "we also studied the influence of laser - induced inelastic decay channel on the considered phenomena .",
    "we considered arising of feshbach resonance with taking into account laser - induced inelastic collision in the case of two - photon resonance between the lower vibrational molecular state in open channel and higher - lying vibrational molecular state in closed channel . in this case",
    ", we obtained that the laser - induced decay of the lower vibrational state into continuum is absent and the feshbach resonances are formed under action of the external magnetic field at formation of two - photon - resonance - dressed states via autler - townes effect . in this case , as follows from the expressions for cross - sections of elastic and inelastic scattering that we obtained in this work , complete quenching of resonances occurs at the energy equal to that of the initial state of considered system , i.e. , @xmath196 ( energy @xmath211 of the stable lower state with its stark shift @xmath212 plus the energy @xmath223 of two photons ) .",
    "such phenomenon is observed in , e.g. , nuclear reactions and in resonant effects in elastic media . by analyzing the expressions for quasienergies and poles of resonances",
    ", we showed existence of some asymmetry in the dependence on the magnetic field value and the laser field strength .",
    "we obtained that under condition @xmath224 crossing of real parts of quasienergies takes place if @xmath225 and anticrossing if @xmath226 .",
    "hence , the interaction pattern does change essentially in the point @xmath227 . in this case",
    "the poles of resonance coincide , @xmath220 , and a double - pole resonance occurs . in order to observe the double peak in the cross - section of resonant scattering at @xmath228 , the condition @xmath226 should be met . under condition",
    "@xmath229 we arrive at the well - known expressions for elastic and inelastic scattering on an isolated level .",
    "it should be noted that the resonant peak dominates in the scattering cross - section at the resonance energy , which enables determination of the quantum number of angular momentum in the resonance state . in all considered cases",
    ", we obtained expressions for the scattering length depending on the magnetic field value and laser radiation intensity .",
    "the results obtained in this work may be employed for novel studies of collisions of cold atoms , in particular , of alkali metal atoms , such as @xmath230rb,@xmath231li , @xmath6cs , and so on , and performing new experiments in becs .",
