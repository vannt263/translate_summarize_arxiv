    "understanding the long - time behavior of an isolated many - body quantum system after it is brought out of equilibrium represents a fundamental physical problem .",
    "arguably , the simplest paradigm is that of a quantum quench @xcite , where a well - defined initial state is let evolved unitarily under a time independent hamiltonian .    in the past decade",
    ", tremendous theoretical efforts have been devoted to the study of quantum quenches , an important motivation being recent experimental progress in ultracold atomic physics @xcite .",
    "many beautiful experiments have now shown that nearly isolated quantum systems can be taken far from equilibrium using quantum quenches and their dynamics studied in great detail @xcite .",
    "such experiments have made it clear the need for a theoretical understanding of quantum dynamics in isolated systems , which may have been considered to be a purely academic problem before .    among others ,",
    "one question has emerged as specially important : is it possible to predict the properties of a post - quench steady state based on simple physical principles ?",
    "this question is particularly relevant when compared to the prohibitive complexity of computing the full post - quench time evolution of a many - body quantum system , and has inspired an intense theoretical research activity . as a result",
    ", it has been concluded that a fundamental difference exists between generic and integrable systems . in the former",
    ", it was proposed that the post - quench steady state can be described by a thermal gibbs ensemble , where the effective temperature is fixed by the initial state @xcite . on the other hand , in integrable models a key role",
    "is played by the presence of an extensive number of conservation laws and such systems retain much more information on the initial state @xcite .",
    "accordingly , in order to characterize the post - quench steady state a generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) was proposed , which is constructed by taking into account conservation laws emerging from integrability @xcite .",
    "much subsequent work has addressed the subtle question of which conserved operators ( or charges ) have to be taken into account in the gge . in integrable models mappable to noninteracting ones , either the occupation of the single - particle eigenstates of the noninteracting problem or all _ local _ conserved charges",
    "have been shown to produce correct physical predictions following quantum quenches @xcite .",
    "however , recent investigations in models that can not be mapped onto noninteracting ones ( referred to as interacting integrable models in what follows ) have unraveled the need for considering more generally all _ quasi - local _ conservation laws @xcite .",
    "the existence of quasi - local conserved charges in interacting integrable lattice models was discovered in the context of thermal spin transport @xcite , where a number of works have been devoted to analyze their physical consequences @xcite .",
    "note that additional non - local conservation laws and their importance on relaxation processes have also been recently discussed in xy spin chains @xcite and integrable quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "the ensemble obtained by considering only local conserved operators is now called the local ( or ultra - local ) gge , while the correct construction which includes all quasi - local charges is usually referred to as the complete gge . for a pedagogical introduction to these topics",
    "see the recent reviews @xcite .",
    "an important role in the more recent developments has been played by the introduction of the so - called quench action approach @xcite .",
    "the latter is an analytical method that allows one to compute physical quantities on the post - quench steady state based on bethe ansatz techniques . at the moment ,",
    "its applicability is limited to those initial states for which the overlaps with the eigenstates of the hamiltonian after the quench are known analytically @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has already been successfully employed in the study of several quantum quenches @xcite , and was an essential theoretical tool for establishing the failure of the local gge in interacting systems @xcite .",
    "most of the progress related to interacting integrable models has occurred remarkably rapidly .",
    "it is then imperative to substantiate the body of evidence in favor of the complete gge conjecture , which at the moment has been tested to high precision for a relatively small number of initial states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the majority of the cases , the local gge has been found to provide extremely good predictions for local observables .",
    "an important question related to experiments is whether one can always expect the local gge to give predictions that are sufficiently accurate for all practical purposes .",
    "the systematic investigation of these issues provides the first motivation for our work .",
    "in particular , we focus on the prototypical xxz spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chain and consider families of initial states given by antiferromagnets and tilted ferromagnets for several values of the tilting angle .",
    "complete gge results for some tilting angles and local correlators involving those families of initial states have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we systematically compare the complete gge against calculations for the diagonal ensemble using exact diagonalization ( ed ) and numerical - linked cluster expansions ( nlces ) @xcite .",
    "we find perfect agreement for all the cases considered , thus providing the most accurate benchmark to date of the complete gge .",
    "furthermore , we show that for tilted ferromagnets the predictions of the local and complete gges are significantly different , only the latter being in agreement with ed and nlce calculations .",
    "this observation likely shifts the failure of the local gge from a purely academic result to something that can be effectively tested experimentally .",
    "we also characterize the post - quench steady states beyond short - distance correlators . in the bethe ansatz language , any statistical ensemble ( and hence any gge )",
    "can be characterized in terms of quasi - particle rapidity distribution functions , which generalize the concept of particle momentum distribution from noninteracting systems .",
    "in fact , one of the simplest quantities in this context is provided by the corresponding entropy , the so - called yang - yang entropy @xcite . while it is an established result that for thermal states the latter coincides with the thermal entropy @xcite , its meaning for non - equilibrium steady states has yet to be clarified .",
    "we note that the yang - yang entropy has recently been used as one of the key ingredients in the computation of entanglement dynamics in heisenberg spin chains @xcite , and has thus already proven to be of great interest in the study of quantum quenches .",
    "a detailed investigation of this quantity provides the second motivation of our work .",
    "in particular , we study the relation between the yang - yang entropy and the so - called diagonal entropy , whose thermodynamic meaning has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "for all the initial states considered , we show that the yang - yang entropy for the complete gge is twice the value of the diagonal entropy , similar to results obtained for several quantum quenches in translationally invariant systems that are either noninteracting or that can be mapped onto noninteracting ones @xcite ( see ref .",

    "the presentation is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : setup ] , we introduce the xxz spin-@xmath0 heisenberg hamiltonian and the quantum quenches considered in this work , while in section  [ sec : bethe_ansatzs ] we briefly introduce the bethe ansatz language used to describe the complete gge . in section  [ sec : local_correlations ] , we compare the bethe ansatz predictions with the results from ed and nlces for the diagonal ensemble .",

    "we restrict our study to the regime @xmath5 .",
    "we consider quantum quenches from two different initial states , namely , the nel state [ eq : neel ] |n=|  |=|^l/2 , and the tilted ferromagnet |;=^l . [ eq : ferromagnet ] quantum quenches from the nel state",
    "were previously considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , were the quench action approach was employed to obtain an explicit characterization of the post - quench steady state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the latter coincides with the complete gge constructed using all local and quasi - local charges .",
    "for the tilted ferromagnet , in contrast , the overlaps needed to implement the quench action are not known and the construction of the complete gge provides for the moment the only available analytical approach to obtain predictions on the post - quench steady state .    in the next section ,",
    "we review the bethe ansatz description of the complete gge in terms of rapidity distribution functions .    on the other hand , in our numerical calculations using ed and nlces ( see appendix  [ sec : diag_nlces ] ) , correlators after the quench are computed in the so - called diagonal ensemble @xcite , for which the density matrix reads [ eq : diagensem ] _ _",

    ", we have found that finite size effects in the ed calculations are severe and , unlike for the nel state , a direct comparison between the ed results for the largest chains and the complete gge results is not meaningful . instead , careful finite - size scaling analyses of the ed results are required .",
    "the fitting procedure followed is explained in appendix  [ app : fit ] .",
    "here , we focus on discussing the results obtained with it .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows that , like for the nel state , the yang - yang entropy in the complete gge is twice the extrapolated ed result of the entropy in the diagonal ensemble .",
    "we find that finite - size effects in the ed calculations increase significantly as the tilting angle approaches @xmath40 , and the fitting procedure becomes unstable .",
    "accordingly , we observe a discrepancy for @xmath40 between the bethe ansatz and extrapolated ed result . the discrepancy is larger for @xmath32 than for @xmath37 . we interpret those discrepancies to be the result of our fitting procedure failing to predict the diagonal entropy per site in the thermodynamic limit",

    "[ fig:6 ] also shows that the yang - yang entropy of the local gge is much larger than the one of the complete gge . for @xmath40 and @xmath37",
    ", @xmath53 is about two times larger than @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is closer to the entropy of the grand - canonical ensemble @xmath57 than to @xmath52 .",
    "this unambiguously demonstrates that , in contrast to the nel state , for the tilted ferromagnet the local gge contains much less information than the complete gge . for this state , neglecting the contribution of the quasi - local charges results in an ensemble that is significantly different from the one needed to describe the steady state following a quantum quench .",
    "this offers further support to the conclusions of our analysis of short - range correlators in sec .",
    "[ sec : local_correlations ] .",
    "we studied quantum quenches to the xxz spin-1/2 heisenberg chain from the nel and tilted ferromagnetic states .",

    "our analysis of short - range correlators provides one of the most accurate benchmarks to date of the validity of the complete gge .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the local gge predictions differ significantly from those of the complete gge in the case of tilted ferromagnets .",
    "this discrepancy can be clearly and without ambiguity resolved by ed and nlce calculations , and could potentially be tested in experiments .",
    "furthermore , we calculated the diagonal entropy for the complete gge in the xxz spin-1/2 heisenberg chain after quantum quenches from different initial states . using careful finite - size scaling analyzes , we found that the diagonal entropy is one half the yang - yang entropy for both the nel and the tilted ferromagnet state .",
    "we argued that our findings are consistent with the picture of pair particle production after a quench , recovering the results obtained in several translationally invariant systems that are either noninteracting or that can be mapped onto noninteracting ones @xcite .",

    "the ed calculations are performed in chains with periodic boundary conditions and with up to @xmath26 sites .    to take full advantage of translational symmetry",
    ", we do not deal directly with the nel state in eq .",
    "but rather with its translational invariant version : [ eq : neelt ] |n=(|^l/2+|^l/2 ) , this state can only be accommodated in chains with an even number of sites and belongs to the zero magnetization sector [ the total magnetization commutes with the xxz spin-1/2 hamiltonian ] . in addition , this state belongs to the zero momentum sector and it is parity even . all our calculations for the diagonal ensemble are performed in this sub - sector of the hilbert space .",
    "the largest matrices that need to be fully diagonalized for @xmath26 have linear dimension @xmath58 .    the tilted ferromagnetic state in eq .",
    "is already translationally invariant and belongs to the zero momentum ",
    "parity even  sector .",
    "however , in contrast to the nel state , the tilted ferromagnet is a superposition of states that belong to all magnetization sectors . as a result",
    ", while the largest matrices that need to be diagonalized for each chain of size @xmath28 are the same size as those for the nel state , one also has to diagonalize many other smaller ones for all non - zero magnetization sectors .",
    "in addition , this state can also be accommodated in chains with an odd number of sites , so we have done calculations for chains with even and odd number of sites .",
    "the nlce calculations for the diagonal ensemble , on the other hand , allow one to compute the expectation value of extensive observables ( per lattice site , @xmath59 ) after a quench in translationally invariant lattice systems in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "this is done by summing over the contributions from connected clusters @xmath60 that can be embedded on the lattice @xmath61 in the expression above , @xmath62 is the multiplicity of cluster @xmath60 ( the number of ways per site in it can be embedded on the lattice ) and @xmath63 is the weight of the observable of interest @xmath64 in cluster @xmath60 .",

    "nlces for the diagonal ensemble are carried out in clusters with up to 19 lattice sites .",
    "this means that the sum in eq .   only contains results for clusters with at most 19 sites . to gain an understanding of how the results converge to the thermodynamic limit ones",
    "as the cluster sizes are increased , we denote by @xmath69 the sum in eq .   when all clusters with up @xmath38 sites are included .",
    "@xmath38 is usually referred to as the order of the expansion and is reported in the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the fact that the clusters in nlces have open boundary conditions , namely , they lack translational symmetry and hence are more costly to fully diagonalize , explains why we are limited to smaller cluster sizes in nlces than chains sizes in ed .",

    "the nlce calculations for the tilted ferromagnet are carried out in a similar fashion .",
    "for each cluster in the expansion , we use the fact that the tilted ferromagnet is parity even and consider all magnetization sectors ( in contrast to the nel state @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the nlce calculations for the tilted ferromagnet more costly than those for the nel state .",
    "also , for the tilted ferromagnet , the connected nearest neighbor longitudinal correlators are computed after the sub - cluster subtraction is performed . on the other hand , for next nearest neighbors sites , the connected longitudinal correlators are computed at the cluster level and the sub - cluster subtraction is performed afterwards .",
