    "bl lac objects are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) exhibiting strong nonthermal emission , superluminal motion , rapid and large flux and polarization variability . in contrast with other classes of agn ,",
    "their spectra are characterized by the absence or extreme weakness of emission lines .    in the standard model of bl lacs , the weak emission lines ( if present )",
    "are generated by fluorescence , as in other types of agn .",
    "the line equivalent width ( ew ) is reduced by the strong beamed continuum , caused by the alignment with our line of sight of the relativistic jet produced by the nucleus . on the other hand absorption lines",
    "can be produced either from spectral features of the stellar population of the host galaxy or from intervening halos as in the case of quasars ( mainly for high redshift sources ) .",
    "detectability of the absorption features depends inversely on the brightness state of the central source . because of the weakness of the emission lines ( usually ew@xmath25  ) and the relatively bright central continuum source with respect to the emission from the host galaxy , in many cases the redshift of these objects is unknown and/or very uncertain .",
    "the obvious implication of this is that the distance of the sources remains undetermined , hampering a proper evaluation the physical parameters of the objects .    in the past decade",
    "a number of projects were carried out to derive the redshift of bl lac objects either for selected targets or to obtain as much redshift information as possible for complete samples of bl lacs .",

    "* ) were based on optical spectra collected with @xmath34 m class telescopes and are therefore limited by either relatively low s / n ( @xmath250 ) or to bright objects ( m@xmath415 ) . as a result of this in spite of the use of relatively large aperture telescopes in a number of cases the redshift remained unknown .",
    "since the detection of spectral features critically depends on the s / n of the spectra it is clear that a further step towards the knowledge of the redshift of bl lacs requires the use of 8 m class telescopes .    with these aims in mind",
    "we have carried out a project to secure optical spectra of bl lacs of still unknown or uncertain redshift with the highest possible s / n using vlt in service mode .",
    "such a program can be executed even during non photometric sky and poor seeing conditions and does not interfere with higher priority programs performed at large aperture telescopes .",
    "we selected sources from various lists of bl lacs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with 15@xmath5m@xmath622 , and @xmath720@xmath8 thus ensuring to obtain high s / n spectra with reasonable exposure times at vlt . under these assumptions we constructed a sample of @xmath060 targets .",
    "31 have been observed in the first two campaigns while the others are scheduled . of these observed sources",
    "12 have featureless spectra , 2 turn out to be galactic stars , 2 are early type galaxies , 3 are high redshift quasars and 12 are bl lacs for which the redshift has been measured by us .    in this paper",
    "we report the results concerning these 12 objects . a full account of the observations for the featureless bl lacs and the other sources will be presented in a later publication .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows : in section 2 we describe the observations and the data analysis ; the results for individual objects are presented in section 3 and finally we give in section 4 a brief discussion of our findings .    to compute absolute quantities we adopted a cosmology with h@xmath9=70 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11=0.3 , @xmath12=0.7 .",
    "optical spectra were collected in service mode in paranal ( chile ) with vlt ut1 ( antu ) equipped with fors1 @xcite in the period april 2003 to march 2004 .",
    "we used the 300v+i grism combined with a 2  slit , yielding a dispersion 110  / mm ( corresponding to 2.64  / pixel ) and spectral resolution=1520   covering the 3800@xmath18000    range .",
    "the seeing during observations was in the range 0.5@xmath12.5  , with an average of @xmath01  .",
    "a list of the observed objects , along with relevant informations , is given in table [ tab : list ] .",
    "data reduction was performed using iraf@xcite following standard procedures for spectral analysis . for each target",
    "we obtained three individual spectra in order to produce adequate correction of cosmic rays and , eventually , to provide independent check of weak features .",
    "the individual frames were then combined into a single average spectrum and processed .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using the spectra of a helium neon argon lamp obtained during the same observing night .",
    "this allows one to obtain wavelength calibrated spectra with an accuracy of @xmath0 3 (rms ) . from these calibrated images we extracted one - dimensional spectra adopting an optimal extraction algorithm @xcite to improve the s / n .",
    "although this program did not require good photometric conditions most of the observations were obtained during clear nights .",
    "this enables us to perform a spectrophotometric calibration of the acquired data using observations of standard stars @xcite observed in the same nights . from the photometric database at paranal we estimate that a photometric accuracy of 10% was reached during our observing nights .",
    "the spectra were also corrected for galactic extinction , using the extinction law by @xcite and assuming values of e(b - v ) from @xcite .",
    "we calculated the spectral index of the dereddened spectra , fitting to the continuum a simple power - law @xmath13 .    in order to detect faint spectral features we evaluate for each spectrum the minimum measurable ew .",
    "this quantity was derived computing the ew for each interval of wavelengths of fixed size ( 20  ) along the whole spectrum but excluding the telluric absorptions . in each spectral bin",
    "we evaluate the ew , as the integral of the ( f@xmath14-f@xmath15)/f@xmath15 where f@xmath14 is the total flux inside the bin , and f@xmath15 is the continuum flux inside the bin .",
    "f@xmath15 is obtained from a linear interpolation of the fluxes in the adjacent bins . where no spectral features are present the ew measurements yields a value around zero and their distribution gives a representation of the noise in the actual spectrum .",
    "we assume that a spectral line is significant when its ew is larger than 3 times the rms of the distribution .",
    "this is also taken as the minimum detectable ew ( ew@xmath16 ) .",
    "an example of this procedure is shown in figure [ fig : ewdist ] .",
    "all the features above the threshold were considered as line candidates and were carefully visually inspected . for the spectra presented here",
    "the ew@xmath16 ranges from @xmath0 1    to 0.1   and it is clearly well correlated with the s / n of each spectrum , which was taken in a 100   wide bin , centered at 6100   ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "line centers and fwhm were determined using a gaussian fit to the line profile .",
    "the calibrated spectra , corrected for the galactic extinction , are given in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "line identifications and parameters , redshift estimates , observed v magnitudes ( obtained from the monochromatic flux at 5500  ) and continuum slopes are given in table [ tab : lines ] .",
    "the observed magnitudes of our targets are consistent with the values reported in the @xcite catalogue within @xmath00.5 magnitudes .",
