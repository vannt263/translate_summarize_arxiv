    "the baikal neutrino telescope is operated in lake baikal , siberia , at a depth of 1.1  km .",
    "deep baikal water is characterized by an absorption length of @xmath7nm@xmath8 m , a scattering length of @xmath9 m and a strongly anisotropic scattering function with a mean cosine of scattering angle @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the first stage telescope configuration nt200 @xcite was put into permanent operation on april 6th , 1998 and consists of 192 optical modules ( oms ) .",
    "an umbrella - like frame carries 8 strings , each with 24 pairwise arranged oms ( see central part of fig .",
    "[ fig_nt200 ] ) .",
    "four underwater electrical cables connect the detector with the shore station .",
    "each optical module contains a 37-cm diameter quasar - photomultiplier ( pm ) which has been developed specially for this project @xcite .",
    "the two pms of a pair are switched in local coincidence in order to suppress background from bioluminescence and pm noise ; each pair defines a _",
    "channel_.    the upgraded telescope nt200 + was put into operation on april 9th , 2005 .",
    "this configuration consists of the old nt200 telescope , surrounded by three new , external strings placed 100 m away from nt200 ( see fig.[fig_nt200 ] ) . with these new strings , the sensitivity of the baikal telescope for very high energy neutrinos increases by a factor 4 .    with the nt200 telescope ,",
    "a number of relevant physics results has been obtained so far : searches for wimps , high energy atmospheric muon neutrinos and muons , relativistic and slow magnetic monopoles and diffuse extraterrestrial high energy neutrinos .",
    "reviews were given at this conference @xcite , and in refs.@xcite .",
    "the nt200 all - flavor limit for a steady diffuse neutrino flux with @xmath3 shape , @xmath11@xmath1s@xmath2sr@xmath2gev ( 20tev @xmath12 e @xmath12 50pev ) , is among the most sensitive limits published so far by neutrino telescopes @xcite .    for nt200",
    ", the detection strategy for high energy neutrino events is based on a search for cherenkov light from pointlike cascades in a mton - scale sensitive volume below the detector , which is much exceeding the instrumented geometric volume ( v@xmath13(nt200)@xmath14 0.1mton ) .    with the upgrade to nt200 + ,",
    "the effective volume is now `` fenced '' by 3 distant , long outer strings with only 36 oms in total , which will give physics information on high energy showers well exceeding that of nt200 : the long baseline allows to localize the shower position , and hence the shower energy .",
    "this significantly improves the rejection capability against the physics background ( mainly high energy atmospheric muons with em - showers , passing not far below nt200 ) .",
    "a measurement of the shower energy will be possible .",
    "fig.[fig_effvol ] gives the detection volume for nt200 + as function of neutrino energy for @xmath15 and @xmath16 events between 10tev and 1eev .",
    "the sensitivity to an @xmath3-diffuse all - flavor neutrino flux is @xmath0@xmath1s@xmath2sr@xmath2gev ( e @xmath17tev , 3 years ) @xcite .    in this paper , we describe the new nt200 + telescope , being the natural extension of nt200 , and it s data acquisition , control and calibration systems .",
    "nt200 + will be used as the basic cell of a future km3-scale detector ( gigaton volume detector ) in lake baikal , which is briefly sketched .",
    "the upgraded telescope nt200 + was commissioned in april , 2005 .",
    "this new configuration consists of a central part ( the old telescope nt200 ) and three new , external strings ( nt+ ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig_nt200 ] .",
    "the external strings are 200  m long ( 140  m instrumented ) and are placed at 100  meter distance from the center of nt200 .",
    "each string contains 12 oms , grouped in channels ( om pairs ) like in nt200 .",
    "the upper channels are at approximately the same depth as the bottom oms of nt200 , adjacent channel distances are 20,50 , 20 , 30 and 20 m from top to bottom ( for depths of upper , 3rd and lower channels see fig.[fig_nt200 ] ) .",
    "all channels are downlooking , except the lower two on each string ( uplooking ) .",
    "two basic tasks had to be solved , in order to integrate nt200 and the external string subsystems into a united nt200 + detector : creation of a data acquisition and control system for the external strings , and providing a time synchronisation between the two subsystems and a tagging of common events ( see also @xcite ) . since a simple doubling of the data acquisition and control system for nt200 and nt+ was compatible neither with the number of available cable connections to shore , nor with future upgrades",
    ", we decided to significantly modernize the system by introducing for the first time embedded pcs with reliable industrial ethernet infrastructure underwater . for nt200 + ,",
    "all data and control cable connections of nt200 and the outer strings go to a new central control and readout unit ( _ daq center _ ) about 20 m below surface ( see fig . [ fig_nt200 ] ) , where they are multiplexed to a single line to shore .",
    "all information necessary to combine nt200 and nt+ sub - events , is provided by the common electronics module ( _ cem _ ) specially designed for nt200 + .",
    "_ cem _ is located at the _ daq center _ and connected through coaxial cables with the nt200 and nt+ daq subsystems .",
    "this module contains tdc units that measure time differences between nt200 and nt+ triggers with a resolution of about 2ns .",
    "also , all nt200 trigger pulses are counted and added to the nt+ data stream .",
    "figure [ fig_daq1 ] sketches the daq and control system of nt200 + , composed of the two subsystems for nt200 and nt+ .",
    "string electronics modules ( _ sem _ ) form the lower level of nt200 + daq system . nt200 and nt+ strings ( _ str _ ) contain two and one sem , respectively .",
    "these units translate trigger request signals from string channels to the detector electronics module ( _ dem _ ) or to _ cem _ for nt+ , and provide time and amplitude measurements for all triggered channels .",
    "a nt200 trigger is formed when the number of fired channels @xmath18 is at least @xmath19 within 500ns at _",
    "@xmath19 is typically set to 3 or 4 .",
    "the trigger signal is used as a common stop for the tdcs of nt200 channels . for common operation with the external strings",
    ", the signal of the nt200 trigger is sent through 1.2 km coaxial cable to _ cem_. the number of nt200 triggers within an experimental run is recorded by a counter in _",
    "cem_. on each external nt+ string , triggers are formed as independent string - triggers , in case of at least 2 fired channels within 1000ns .",
    "string triggers are sent to _",
    "cem _ , where the time difference between string trigger and the trigger of nt200 is measured .",
    "this information is used to relate within an event the times of oms in nt200 and the externals strings .",
    "nt200 and nt+ experimental data are transfered to the shore center through two underwater pcs located in pressure glass spheres .",
    "both underwater pc spheres are nearly identical , their content is detailed in fig .",
    "[ fig_daq2 ] : a single board pc/104 ( _ pc104 : _ advantech - pcm9340 ) , a dsl - modem ( _ dsl - m : _ flexdsl - pam - san , with hub and router ) , a managed ethernet switch ( _ swrstp : _",
    "rs2 - 4r , running rstp protocols for the two - fold redundant ethernet network between the pc spheres ) , an ethernet - comserver ( _ csrv : _ wut-58211 , for pc - terminal emulation ) , two media - converters ( _ mc : _ for coaxial connection to external control units ) and the experiment data and slow - control modems ( _ d - mod _ and _ c - mod _ ) . the connection to shore is by a single dsl - modem at a speed of up to 2  mbit / s .",
    "this full multiplexing of all data and control streams through a single dsl - channel reduces the number of shore wires to two .",
    "both pc spheres are interconnected via two twisted pair ethernet cables ( main and hot spare ) .",
    "this underwater system works stable since its first installation in 2004 .",
    "using linux throughout the system ( for underwater pcs and shore station pcs ) allows for easy remote maintenance and control from home institutions .",
    "large volume underwater cherenkov detectors need calibration of the relative time - offsets between all light - sensors to a precision of a few nsecs , since event reconstruction and classification are based on the precise light arrival times . for nt200 + , calibration is done with a powerful external laser light source with up to @xmath20 photons per pulse and nsec - pulse duration @xcite , which is located between two outer strings , see fig.[fig_nt200 ] .",
    "this ensures amplitudes of @xmath14100 photoelectrons on a few pmts on each external string and on nt200 .",
    "high amplitudes minimize uncertainties due to light scattering .",
    "the nt200 + laser calibration unit is made of a powerful short - pulse nitrogen laser ( @xmath21 nm ) with about 100@xmath22j for @xmath121nsec pulse duration , which is pumping a coumarin dye laser at 480 nm . after passing through a computer - controlled attenuator disc , the light is isotropized by a light diffuser ball , made of a round - bottom flask filled with silicone gel ( rtv-6156 ) admixed with hollow micro - glass spheres at about 5%-volume ratio ( s32 from 3 m , with @xmath23 m diameter ; following an idea developed for the sno detector @xcite ) .",
    "the total loss of this isotropizing sphere is @xmath24 .",
    "all components are mounted into a 1m - long cylindrical glass pressure housing , which gives isotropic emission for more than the upper hemisphere .",
    "the unit is installed at a depth of 1290 m below surface and operated in autonomous mode : after power - on from shore , a series of pulses at various intensities is conducted .",
    "the final light output ranges from approximately @xmath25 to @xmath20 photons / pulse , corresponding to shower energies from 10 pev to 500 pev .",
    "the laser unit is used , varying the total intensity , to calibrate pointlike shower vertex and energy reconstruction algorithms for energies up to 500pev .",
    "this laser unit allows for an independent performance check of the key elements of the nt200 + timing system .",
    "we performed the relative time synchronization of all news strings and nt200 , and find the jitter of this to be less than 3nsec .",
    "this jitter is due mainly to the significant length ( 1.2  km ) of synchronisation line between nt200 and external strings .",
    "the measured dependence of the relative time jitter on pmt amplitudes is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_las ] for several pairs of channels of nt200 and external strings .",
    "mc simulations have shown that the detection volume of nt200@xmath26 for pev cascades would vary only moderately , if nt200 as the central part of nt200@xmath26 is replaced by a single string of oms .",
    "figure [ fig_gvd1 ] gives the detection volume for different configurations as a function of cascade energy .",
    "the standard configuration of is marked by empty rectangles .",
    "the other configurations comprise a single string instead of nt200 : a standard string of 70 m length and 24oms ( filled rectangles ) , a half string with 12oms covering 35 m ( dots ) , and a 70 m long string sparsely equipped with 12oms ( triangles ) . the configuration with the long 12-om string shows an energy behavior very close to the one of nt200@xmath26 .    for neutrino energies above 100tev ,",
    "such a configuration could be used as a basic building block of a km3-scale or gigaton volume detector ( gvd ) .",
    "rough estimations show that @xmath27 gton detection volume for neutrino induced high energy cascades may be achieved with about 1300 oms arranged at 91 strings . a top view of gvd as well as a sketch of one basic subarray are shown in fig . [ fig_gvd2 ] .",
    "the shower energy reconstruction capability is illustrated in fig .",
