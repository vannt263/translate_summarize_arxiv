    "the study of structure in the gaseous halos of galaxies , groups and clusters has been greatly facilitated by the large collecting areas and high spatial resolution of the _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  x - ray observatories .",
    "some useful comparisons of radio , optical and x - ray structure were performed with earlier satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the relatively low efficiency and/or broad point spread functions ( psfs ) of the instruments on _ rosat _ , _ asca _  and _ einstein _  restricted this type of examination to the brightest sources .",
    "_ xmm _  and particularly _ chandra _  have allowed a huge expansion in the field , showing the range and variety of disturbed structures , and demonstrating that they are relatively common .",
    "perhaps most notable are the detailed interactions between the radio jets of active galaxies in the cores of groups and clusters and the surrounding inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "long _ chandra _  observations of m87 in the virgo cluster @xcite and ngc  1275 in perseus @xcite have revealed complex features indicative of shocks , bubbles of radio plasma , filaments of cooling gas and sound wave propagation .",
    "mergers and interactions between galaxies and their environment also often produce visible structures in the igm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    in two prior papers @xcite we examined _ xmm - newton _  observations of two poor , @xmath02.5  kev clusters , awm  4 and mkw  4 .",
    "both were selected to be relaxed systems without significant structure , to allow study of their radial mass and metal abundance profiles .",
    "the _ xmm _",
    "exposures revealed that while the two systems have regular surface brightness distributions and similar total masses , they have distinctly different temperature profiles .",
    "while mkw  4 shows a central temperature decline ( to @xmath01.5  kev ) similar to that seen in many groups and clusters , awm  4 is approximately isothermal despite a central cooling time of only 5@xmath6 yr .",
    "this divergence appears to be related to the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) of ngc  6051 , the dominant galaxy of awm  4 .",
    "spectral mapping shows regions of hot and high abundance gas in the inner cluster halo , correlating with the agn radio jets , suggesting that the halo is being heated by the agn activity .",
    "the differences between the two clusters can therefore be attributed to their differing phase in the cycle of cooling and agn activity ; if cooling is allowed to continue in mkw  4 it is likely to fuel an agn outburst in the central galaxy , while the current activity in awm  4 is likely to halt in the near future , as heating prevents further gas cooling .",
    "the two clusters embody the extremes of the cycle , undisturbed cooling and ongoing outburst .",
    "an interesting possibility arising from this model is the observation of a system in the process of changing state from cooling to heating .",
    "ngc  3411 is the dominant , central elliptical of a galaxy group first identified from the cosmos catalogue of southern sky galaxies @xcite .",
    "later surveys have confirmed the existence of the group , sometime referred to as ss2b  153 or usgc  s152 , identifying three to five bright galaxies as members @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the group is estimated to be 211 @xmath7 , and the total mass of the system @xmath02.7@xmath8 @xmath2 .",
    "ngc  3411 is the only elliptical in the group , and the other confirmed members are @xmath91 mag fainter in the b band . a short _ rosat _  all - sky survey ( rass ) observation showed the galaxy to be at the center of an extended , regular x - ray halo @xcite with a luminosity of @xmath10 @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the galaxy was identified in the rass bright source catalogue @xcite , and comparison with the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed that ngc  3411 also hosts a slightly extended radio source with a flux of 33  mjy at 1.4  ghz @xcite .",
    "the galaxy has been observed as part of the 6df galaxy redshift survey @xcite , and has an absorption dominated optical spectrum , with no obvious signs of agn activity .",
    "more recently , ngc  3411 has been observed by both _",
    "chandra _  and",
    "_ xmm - newton_. @xcite analysed the _",
    "chandra _  data as part of a sample of 13 nearby relaxed clusters , and briefly noted that it did not have a strong central temperature decrement , perhaps indicating a recent agn outburst or stellar winds from the central elliptical .",
    "@xcite included the _ xmm _  dataset as part of their study of eight rasscals groups and found the group halo to be remarkably circular .",
    "they also noted that the gas pressure within @xmath010  kpc was a factor of 2 higher than expected from self - similar scaling , possibly because of gas bound to the central galaxy .    in this paper",

    "the ngc  3411 group was observed with _ xmm - newton _  during orbit 555 ( 2002 december 20 - 21 ) for just under 36,000 seconds ( obsid 0146510301 ) .",
    "the epic instruments were operated in full frame mode , with the thin optical blocking filter . a detailed summary of the _ xmm - newton _  mission and instrumentation can be found in ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "reduction and analysis were performed using techniques similar to those described in @xcite .",
    "the raw data from the epic instruments were processed with the most recent version of the _ xmm - newton _  science analysis system ( sas v.6.5.0 ) , using the epchain and emchain tasks .",

    "response files were generated using the sas   tasks rmfgen and arfgen . because the group is relatively x - ray bright , and the pn detector mode uses a short frame integration time ( 73 ms ) , there are a significant number of out - of - time ( oot ) events , visible in the pn data as a trail extending from the center of the source toward the ccd readout .",
    "an oot events list was created using epchain , and scaled by 0.063 to allow statistical subtraction of the oot events from spectra and images .",
    "point sources were identified using a sliding cell algorithm , and all data within 17  of point sources were removed .",
    "creation of background images and spectra for the system was hampered by the fact that the group x - ray halo extends beyond the field of view .",
    "use of the `` double - subtraction '' technique @xcite involves correcting blank - sky exposures to match a source - free area of the observation ; for ngc  3411 this is not feasible .",
    "we therefore decided to consider the background as two separate components .",
    "the background contribution from high - energy particles can be estimated based on events which are detected outside the field of view .",
    "particles - only datasets , made up of exposures taken with the telescope shutters closed @xcite , were scaled to match these events and used as basis of the background .",
    "the particle component dominates the continuum at high energies and produces a number of strong spectral lines , which vary across the field of view .",
    "the particles - only datasets contain these features , and subtraction of the scaled data from regions matching those used in the source data removes them satisfactorily .",
    "the low energy background arises primarily from soft x - rays emitted by hot gas in the galaxy , and from coronal emission associated with solar wind interactions .",
    "this component can be modelled as a cool plasma extending uniformly over the field of view .",
    "trial fitting of spectra extracted in the outer part of the field of view , and of a _ rosat _",
    "all - sky survey spectrum extracted from an annulus at 1.5 - 2.0  from the group center showed that a 0.2 kev , solar abundance plasma model provided an acceptable fit .",
    "the variation of the soft contribution across the field of view can then be calculated based on a soft energy exposure map , or via the spectral response matrices .",
    "we add this plasma model as an additional component in our spectral fits , with all components frozen . for surface brightness fitting , an exposure map image scaled to match the plasma model contribution is added to the particles - only background image .",
    "we note that this may be a rather simple model for the fairly complex soft background , and ignores issues of small scale variation in the background . however , the group halo is relatively bright and contributes the majority of soft counts at all radii , so variations in the soft background have a relatively minimal impact .",

    "the instrument operated in very faint mode , and observed the target for just under 30 ksec .",
    "reduction and analysis was performed using methods similar to those described in @xcite .",
    "the level 1 events file was reprocessed using ciao v3.2 and caldb v3.2.0 .",
    "bad pixels and events with _ asca _",

    "background flaring occurred through the first early part of the observation , and all periods where the count rate deviated from the mean by more than 3@xmath27 were excluded , so as to prevent contamination .",
    "the exposure time of the observation after cleaning was 18.3 ksec .",
    "we chose to use only data from the s3 chip , as the decline in effective area and broadening point spread function ( psf ) on the more distant chips made data extracted from them less useful than those available from _ xmm - newton_.    point sources were identified using the ciao task wavdetect , with a detection threshold of 10@xmath28 , chosen to ensure that the task detects @xmath291 false source in the field .",
    "source ellipses were generated with axes of length 4 times the standard deviation of each source distribution , and regions of twice this size were removed from the data before further analysis .",
    "a source was detected coincident with the peak of the diffuse x - ray emission ; this was considered a potentially false detection and ignored , though we did later test for the presence of a central x - ray point source .",
    "images and spectra were extracted from the resulting `` clean '' events list and appropriate weighted spectral response matrices were generated using the mkwarf and mkwrmf .",
    "background estimation for spectral fitting was performed in an analogous manner to that described above for the _ xmm - newton _  data .",

    "prior experience has shown that psf convolution is necessary for accurate fitting of _ xmm - newton _  data , but has little effect on _ chandra _  surface brightness fits , owing to the very narrow _ chandra _  psf .",
    "we therefore chose to include psf convolution in the _ xmm_fitting , but excluded it from the _ chandra _  fits .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  images were summed to create a single radial profile as were profiles taken from the psf images . using these data",
    ", we found that our background models and exposure correction provided a good match to the data , to the limits of the profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig.sb ] shows the resulting surface brightness profiles .",
    "fitting was carried out in ciao sherpa , and tests were made fitting the two profiles individually .",
    "the _ xmm _  profile clearly extends far enough to reach the background level , which is modelled by a constant component which is unnecessary in the _ chandra _  fits .",
    "a single beta model proved a poor fit to both profiles , with clear deviations from the data at large and small radii , particularly in the _ xmm _  data .",
    "many groups have surface brightness profiles which require more than one beta model to produce a good fit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this usually indicates an extra component of emission , for example a galaxy halo or cooling flow embedded within a larger group halo .",
    "we therefore fitted a second beta model , which provided a visibly improved fit to the _ xmm _  profile .",
    "the second component provides a slight increase in surface brightness to match a `` bulge '' in the profile at @xmath0100 , and a somewhat steeper slope beyond 300 .",
    "the model was a good fit to the _ chandra _  profile outside @xmath010 , but underestimated the central surface brightness significantly ( see panels a and c of fig .",
    "[ fig.sb ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab.sb ] gives details of this model , which was fitted to the _ xmm _  profile only ( a goodness of fit for the _ chandra _  data is given for comparison , but the model was not fitted to the _ chandra _  data ) .",
    "the residual emission is clearly more extended than would be expected for a point source , and a model including a central point source did not provide a good fit to the central region .",
    "addition of a third beta model did provide a good fit to the central region of the _ chandra _  profile , but simultaneous fitting of both datasets showed that this model overestimated the central surface brightness of the _ xmm _   profile by @xmath025 per cent .",
    "this disagreement seems most likely to be related to the broad _ xmm _  psf , which will act to reduce the peak surface brightness of the epic images .",
    "however , the inclusion of psf convolution in the fit might be expected to correct this issue .",
    "we use monoenergetic ( 1 kev ) psf images to create our psf model , and it is possible that this introduces some error in the convolution , though we would not expect it to be noticeable .",
    "it is also possible that the sherpa convolution algorithm is imperfect , though testing shows that convolution of a delta function with the psf model reproduces the psf to reasonable accuracy . in order to test whether the 2-d psf convolution is more accurate that 1-d , we performed a 2-d fit to the _ xmm _  data using a circular model based on the _ chandra _",
    "1-d fit with normalization free to vary .",
    "we again find that the model overestimates the data , though in this case there is a possibility that the slight ellipticity of the halo produces a fit which is a close match to the data at moderate radii but poorer in the core .",
    "however , it does not appear that fitting in 2-d resolves the problem , suggesting that the 1-d psf convolution is not causing the difference .",

    "spectra were grouped to 20 counts per bin .",
    "the spectra were initially examined and fit by hand using xspec v11.3.2p and were found to be acceptably described by single temperature apec plasma models @xcite .    as group halos are extended along the line of sight as well as in the plane of the sky , and spectral properties",
    "are expected to vary with true rather than projected radius from the group center , we perform a deprojection analysis . using two parallel scripts ,",
    "one based on the xspec projct model and another written using sherpa , we fit the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  spectra and find the temperature and abundance profiles shown in figure  [ fig.deproj ] .",
    "the two scripts produced almost identical results , suggesting that the fits are robust .",
    "the abundance profile is simple , declining from a central peak to low values at large radii , as expected .",
    "the temperature profile is more complex .",
    "typically , relaxed groups have temperature profiles with a central cool region , a peak at moderate radii , and a decline to lower temperatures in the outer halo ( see e.g. , mkw  4 , * ? ? ?",
    "the ngc  3411 profile follows this pattern at radii @xmath6060 , but inside this radius the temperature is higher than expected .",
    "the profile suggests that the group has a hot core , surrounded by a shell of cool gas , in turn surrounded by hotter gas whose temperature slowly declines with radius .",
    "the radius of the cool shell , 60 - 120 , corresponds well with the `` bulge '' seen in the surface brightness profiles in section  [ sec.sb ] .",
    "we would expect the cooler gas of the shell to be slightly more luminous than the warmer gas surrounding it if it is in pressure equilibrium , so this is the likely cause of the excess surface brightness . while the difference between minimum and maximum temperature is small , @xmath00.15 kev for the _ xmm - newton _  data , it is statistically significant ; for the _ chandra _   profile , the temperature difference between bins 1 and 2 is 3.4@xmath27 significant , and between 2 and 3 , 3.9@xmath27 significant ; for the _ xmm _   profile , bins 2 and 3 are different at the 4.75@xmath27 level and bins 4 and 5 are different at the 3.7@xmath27 level .",
    "it is notable that there is a disagreement between the _ chandra _  and _ xmm",
    "_  profiles as to the temperature of the cool shell .",
    "it seems likely that this arises due to the rather broad bins of the _ chandra _  profile and the lack of data points at radii beyond 230 .",
    "deprojection uses the outer bins to estimate the contribution of emission at large radii , in the line of sight , to spectra at smaller projected radii , and then correct for it .",
    "inaccuracies in fitting at large radii are therefore propagated inwards ; if the fitted temperature in a bin is too high , it is likely to lower the temperatures of the bins at smaller radii . in this case , the outermost _ chandra _  bin is broad and probably contains some variation in temperature and abundance which is then approximated , but not completely described , by the fitted model .",
    "the bin will also contain some cool emission from outer shells which may affect the fit , lowering the temperature .",
    "this could potentially lead to an underestimate of the temperature in bin 3 , an undersubtraction of hard emission and therefore a higher temperature in bin 2 . in any case , the fact that bins 3 and 4 of the _ xmm _  profile agree with one another suggests that the disagreement is likely to be an issue with the _ chandra _   analysis , and that the _ xmm _  measurements are more likely to be correct .    to test the robustness of the temperature measurements in the inner region we froze the contributions from the outer bins and fitted a range of models instead of the simple single temperature plasma used in the deprojection .",
    "for the two central _ xmm _  bins , we tested two temperature plasma models , plasma models with elemental abundances free to vary , and combinations of plasma and powerlaw models . in both bins ,",
    "two temperature plasma models improve the fits , but do not lower the temperature of the main spectral component .",
    "the secondary components have temperatures kt=1.72@xmath61  kev and 1.66@xmath62  kev , and contribute @xmath06 and @xmath05 per cent of the total flux . freeing elemental abundances again improves the fit without significantly altering the primary temperature , but does not produce a well constrained fit",
    ". fits to bins 3 and 4 of the _ xmm _  profile are not improved by additional spectral components .",
    "we also tried fitting using the xspec xmmpsf model , which corrects for the scattering of photons between spectral bins by the broad _ xmm _  psf .",
    "inclusion of the model introduced instabilities in the abundance profile , with poor fits in the outer bins leading to a `` ringing '' effect wherein bins had alternately high and low abundances . freezing abundance at the values shown in figure  [ fig.deproj ] for the four outer bins produced a more stable fit .",
    "the resulting temperature profile was very similar to that produced without the xmmpsf model , with differences in each bin smaller than the uncertainty , and estimated uncertainties of the temperatures increasing by 5 - 10 per cent .",
    "this suggests that the width of our spectral bins is sufficient to make the spectra relatively insensitive to psf scattering , which will be dominated by photons scattered outward from the high surface brightness inner regions .",

    "the broader _ xmm _  psf prevents this , by blurring the surface brightness peak ; the _ chandra _  data have fewer total counts , but a higher central surface brightness . however , while the _ xmm _  data have a larger number of spectral extraction regions of the smallest size",
    "the fact that the spectral extraction regions are larger than the map pixels means that spectral fits are not independent ; all spectral regions overlap to some degree .",

    "a dip is visible in the total mass profile .",
    "this is of course unphysical ; total mass can not decline with increasing radius , as this would require the presence of material with negative mass .",

    "alternatively it may indicate a deficiency in our surface brightness model , as a steeper surface brightness gradient at that radius would counter the temperature decline .",

    "using the centrally peaked temperature profile , buote et al.derive a mass profile which is very uncertain , but consistent with the nfw model @xcite .",

    "the temperature maps show that the shell is not completely regular , and the two maps do not entirely agree on the projected distribution of the gas . however , both show cool gas completely surrounding the hotter core region , and both show the largest concentration and the coolest gas to the east of the core .",

    "neither model is physically rigorous ; the most likely true configuration is a spherical hot core located towards one end of a slightly elliptical cool shell . for simplicity , we will assume the former approximation in our discussion , but note that the mass and volume may be a factor @xmath02 lower .",
    "perhaps the most obvious scenario for the formation of the peak and shell is that ngc  3411 is a system in which the center of a cooling region has been reheated . in this model",
    ", the group halo would have been undisturbed until relatively recently , and radiative cooling would have produced a cool inner region with a smoothly declining central temperature profile .",
    "cooling of gas in the core of ngc  3411 itself could then provide fuel for an agn outburst ( or potentially for star formation , though the current absorption dominated optical spectrum argues against this ) which would provide enough energy to partially reheat the gas , producing the hot core which we observe .",
    "we can estimate the minimum energy required by assuming that the core was heated from a temperature of 0.7  kev ( equal to the cool shell ) to its current state .",
    "this would require @xmath93@xmath94 .",
    "using the relation between agn luminosity and mechanical power output @xcite , we can estimate the current rate of energy injection from the agn in ngc  3411 to be @xmath08.2@xmath95@xmath5 .",
    "this is somewhat higher than the upper limits on the current x - ray luminosity of the agn , but is considerably lower than the rate at which energy is lost from the core through radiative cooling , 1.13@xmath96 @xmath5 .",
    "this strongly suggests that if agn heating is responsible for the raised temperature of the core , the agn power output must have been significantly larger in the past .",
    "energy injection at 10@xmath97@xmath5  could produce this change in @xmath07.2 myr , while injection at 4 times the current mechanical power estimate would take @xmath030  myr .",
    "however , these energy requirements should be considered lower limits ; if the group did possess a cool core prior to reheating , the centre of that region would likely have been cooler than 0.7  kev .",
    "the maximum energy injection rate is limited by the fact that we see no sign of convective instability , which would be expected if the heating were very rapid .",
    "the smooth entropy gradient observed shows that the gas heating rate was not sufficient to drive convective gas flows .",

    "are known to have diffuse bipolar radio structures centered on the agn , similar to the radio structure we see in the core of ngc  3411 @xcite .",

    "* and references therein )",

    "ngc  3411 has a considerably more massive smbh than a typical seyfert galaxy and is perhaps more comparable with bal qsos , but the output would still likely be only a few 10@xmath100  @xmath5 , to low to be responsible for heating or maintaining the temperature in the group core . in any case ,",
    "the lack of a definite x - ray source associated with the radio peak , the substructures to the north and south of the radio core , the lack of a decrease in central surface brightness ( as would be expected if a jet in the line of sight had excavated cavities in the x - ray halo ) and the absorption dominated optical spectrum all strongly suggest that the agn is heavily absorbed , and probably has an axis close to the plane of the sky .",
    "an alternative is that the cool shell is the product of a merger .",
    "it is well established that galaxies falling through the igm of a galaxy cluster can be stripped of their gas by ram pressure , with several examples observed in nearby systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an early - type galaxy , falling into the ngc  3411 group and passing through the core , could potentially lose a significant fraction of its gaseous halo .",
    "the stripped gas would sink or rise to a level where its entropy matches that of the surrounding igm , and spread along the equal entropy surface , forming a shell . as the stripped gas would have a fairly constant entropy",
    ", we might expect the entropy profile to flatten at the radius of the cool shell , and to some extent this is visible in our entropy models .",
    "the 0.7  kev temperature observed in the shell is quite typical of both group and elliptical galaxy halos .",
    "if the shell is the product of a merger , no energy input from the agn would be required , except perhaps to balance energy lost through radiative cooling .",
    "there are however a number of potential problems with this model .",
    "the smoothly declining abundance profile shows no feature at the position of the cool shell , arguing that the gas has the same origin and enrichment history as the warmer regions around it .",
    "ram - pressure stripping is most effective at high velocities and in high density gas .",
    "galaxy clusters often have cores of radius @xmath0100  kpc , within which the density n@xmath1010.01@xmath102  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the ngc  3411 halo reaches comparable densities only in the central @xmath020  kpc , so an almost radial orbit would be required .",
    "turbulent and viscous stripping mechanisms can be effective at lower velocities , but these are less efficient at removing gas @xcite , suggesting that the cool shell would represent only a part of the halo of the stripped object .",
    "the amount of gas in the shell is quite sizable . @xcite",
    "measured the relation between halo gas mass and optical luminosity in elliptical galaxies , and we can use this to predict the size of a galaxy which could produce the shell . if we assume that all the gas in the shell is from the stripped galaxy , and that the galaxy halo was entirely removed , the relation suggests that we should expect an object with log @xmath22=11.2 @xmath15 .",
    "the scatter in the relation is quite large , but this still suggests a galaxy of comparable or greater optical luminosity than ngc  3411 itself .",
    "the next most luminous galaxy in the group is a factor @xmath01.5 fainter .    to identify galaxies which might have interacted with ngc  3411 at some point in the past , we selected those objects within 2000@xmath7  and 1  mpc on the sky . comparing k - band luminosities ( which avoid bias from young stellar populations )",
    ", we find that there are four nearby galaxies of comparable size ; ngc  3404 ( @xmath23=11.24@xmath24 ) , ic  647 ( 10.32 ) , ngc  3421 ( 10.83 ) , ngc  3422 ( 10.96 ) .",
    "all four galaxies have recession velocities within 250@xmath7of that of ngc  3411 . of these",
    ", the location of the s0 ic  647 inside the cool shell just to the east of ngc  3411 might initially suggest a connection .",
    "however , for its halo to be the source of the gas in the cool shell , it would have to have been stripped during a previous passage through the core so the observed superposition would be a very unlikely conspiracy",
    ". it may be that the galaxy halo ( if one exists ) affects the temperature map , decreasing the temperature at that position .",
    "however , while there is excess surface brightness in the region of ic  647 we can not say how much is associated with the galaxy .",
    "ngc  3421 is a disturbed face - on spiral galaxy @xmath00.5  mpc to the north of ngc  3411 .",
    "while late - type spirals predominantly contain cool gas , it has been suggested that vigorous star formation may heat this gas and cause it to expand and diffuse away from the galactic disk , making ram - pressure stripping more efficient @xcite .",
    "however , ngc  3421 has several regions of ongoing star formation , casting doubt on the possibility that it has been significantly stripped .",
    "the two remaining galaxies , ngc  3422 and ngc  3404 are distant enough that the cool shell would have to be unrealistically old ( 1 - 2  gyr ) for them to have been its source , assuming motion at the group velocity dispersion of 500  @xmath7 .",
    "we can put a lower limit on the lifetime of the cool gas shell by estimating the rate at which it should be heated by conduction from the surrounding gas .",
    "we again assume a uniform shell of gas , 20  kpc thick , and that the process does not affect the surrounding hot gas in any way .",
    "we assume a temperature gradient of 0.14  kev over 9.5  kpc , the distance between the mid - points of the _ xmm _  spectral bins .",
    "the heat flux across this gradient can be described as @xcite :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is the heat flux , @xmath105 is the electron temperature and @xmath106 is the thermal conductivity , defined as @xcite :    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the electron density , @xmath109 is the electron mass , and @xmath110 is the electron mean free path . in a fully ionized gas mainly composed of hydrogen , the mean free path is defined as @xcite :    @xmath111    where @xmath112/10  kev , @xmath113@xmath102 , and @xmath114 is the impact parameter of the coulomb collisions , defined as :    @xmath115.\\ ] ]    from these equations , we find a mean free path of @xmath054  pc , and estimate that with conduction at the spitzer rate , the heat flux across the boundaries of the shell would be 1.96@xmath116@xmath5 , suggesting that the shell would be heated to the surrounding temperature in @xmath08  myr .",
    "this value would be reduced if the temperature gradient were steeper , but would increase if the hot and cool regions were magnetically separated .",
    "in undisturbed regions of the igm , magnetic field lines are commonly assumed to be tangled , producing only small reductions of the conduction rate .",
    "however , processes which introduce structure into the igm ( _ e.g .",
    "_ radio jets and lobe inflation , mergers , and gas motions ) are thought to straighten the field lines , suppressing conduction across boundaries by large factors . in the case of ngc  3411",
    ", the amount of suppression required depends on our model for the formation of the cool region . if it is a cool core which has been reheated by agn activity , only mild suppression is necessary , as the timescale to heat the core is @xmath030  myr .",
    "heating and expansion of the gas in the central region could cause suppression along the inner shell surface , as field lines are stretched , and reducing conduction by a factor of @xmath020 could be sufficient .",
    "if the shell is stripped gas , it must be a much more long - lived structure , with an age of at least a few 10@xmath117 yr . in this case",
    ", conduction would have to be suppressed by a factor of a hundred or more .",
    "one of the stronger observational constraints on conduction in galaxy clusters comes from the temperature variations within the disturbed cluster a754 .",
    "@xcite suggest that conduction can not be more than a few percent of the spitzer rate in this system .",
    "studies of conduction as a mechanism for balancing cooling in galaxy clusters suggest that rates of a few hundredths to a few tenths of the spitzer value are likely typical @xcite . while these studies tend to focus on much hotter , higher mass systems than ngc  3411 , an examination of the @xmath02  kev virgo cluster finds similar conduction rates @xcite .",
    "if these estimates hold true for ngc  3411 , they suggest that the conduction rate could easily be low enough to agree with our agn heating hypothesis .",
    "the suppression factor required by the merger model is at the more extreme end of the range , and suggests that the other galaxies in the group may not be viable sources of stripped gas unless their velocity in the plane of the sky is large .",
    "the gas mass and cooling time profiles for the group halo are both rather typical of a system of this temperature .",
    "it is notable that despite its lower temperature , the cool shell surrounding the central elliptical still has a longer cooling time than the slightly hotter core .",
    "the cooling time drops below 1  gyr at @xmath030  kpc , around the midpoint of the cool shell , and is 400 - 500  myr at 10  kpc .",
    "this emphasizes the need for a long - term heat source to prevent runaway cooling . as discussed in section  [ sec.mass ] ,",
    "the total mass profile is unusual only in the unphysical decline at @xmath040  kpc , which seems to indicate a deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium at the outer edge of the cool shell .",
    "depending on the formation mechanism it is possible that all the gas in the shell , or even the entire core and shell , could be out of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "however , as the mass profile only becomes unphysical at the outer boundary of the shell , it seems likely that it is only in this region that the deviation from equilibrium becomes severe , and that at smaller radii the mass profile is still reasonably reliable .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio profile stays above the expected stellar m / l of @xmath05 throughout , suggesting the presence of dark matter even at relatively small radii .",
    "simulations of group formation suggest that we should expect dark matter halos associated both with the member galaxies and with the group potential as a whole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the increase in the slope of m / l outside @xmath020  kpc seems likely to indicate the point at which the group dark matter halo begins to dominate over the mass contribution associated with ngc  3411 .",
    "the measured entropy profile compares reasonably well with the results of @xcite , unsurprisingly given that both studies make use of the same _ xmm _  dataset .",
    "there is some discrepancy at the largest radii , with the mahdavi et al .",
    "result being a factor of @xmath03 lower than our best fit value at @xmath0200  kpc .",
    "however , the two values appear to be comparable given the uncertainties on our entropy profile and the small amount of scatter in the mahdavi et al data points . there may be a larger discrepancy between our total mass and the optical estimate of @xcite , who suggest a mass of @xmath02.7@xmath8 @xmath2  within a virial radius of @xmath01.2  mpc .",
    "a direct comparison would require a large extrapolation of our data , which only extend to @xmath0200  kpc , but our total mass in that radius , @xmath08.5@xmath118 @xmath2 , is high enough to suggest that the total mass of the system would be considerably higher .",
    "however , as the ramella et al .",
    "estimate is based on velocities from only five group member galaxies , the uncertainty on this estimate is likely large , and the discrepancy may not be serious .",
    "in order to examine the properties of the ngc  3411 group and the interactions between the central dominant elliptical and the group halo , we have analysed _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _  and vla observations of the system .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the group halo has a highly unusual temperature structure .",
    "the radial temperature profile rises from @xmath00.72  kev at large radius to a peak of @xmath00.84  kev at @xmath050  kpc .",
    "this hot gas encloses a shell of cool , @xmath00.7  kev gas which itself surrounds the hotter @xmath00.84  kev core . while these temperature differences are small , they are statistically significant .",
    "spectral mapping confirms that the cool gas completely surrounds the core ( in projection ) and shows the largest concentration of the coolest gas to be located west of the group core .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  x - ray surface brightness profile requires two beta models to produce a good fit , the second component producing a slight excess at @xmath030  kpc radius , corresponding to the shell of cool gas . _ chandra _   surface brightness modelling shows a third component in the core which is not resolved by the _ xmm",
    "this component is extended , and is therefore more likely related to diffuse or unresolved emission within the central galaxy than with agn activity .",
    "the deprojected abundance profile is typical of a galaxy group , with a central peak or 1 - 1.5@xmath75  and decline with radius .",
    "the profile shows no features corresponding to those in the temperature profile .",
    "4 .   calculation of the total mass , entropy , cooling time and mass - to - light ratio shows them to be fairly typical of galaxy groups . there is no entropy inversion in the core , indicating that any heating in the system has been slow .",
    "the cooling time of the system is shorter than 10@xmath119 yr within @xmath020  kpc , suggesting that some source of heating is necessary in the long term to prevent runaway cooling .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio profile supports the presence of dark matter at all radii with the possible exception of the innermost galaxy core . a change in gradient at @xmath020",
    "kpc may indicate the point at which the group dark matter halo begins to dominate the mass distribution .",
    "however , an unphysical decline in total mass at @xmath035  kpc suggests that the gas is not in hydrostatic equilibrium at this point .",
    "analysis of the vla observations at 1.4 , 5 and 8  ghz reveals a resolved nuclear source with a luminosity of 2.7@xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "there is also evidence for some diffuse emission at 1.4  ghz , extending a few arcseconds .",
    "there is no sign of well defined radio jets or lobes , and this may indicate that the agn is is a relatively quiescent state",
    ". an agn driven wind may be responsible for the diffuse radio emission we observe .",
    "there is little evidence for significant agn activity in the x - ray data , and the _ chandra _  data places a firm upper limit on the agn 0.4 - 7.0  kev luminosity of @xmath06@xmath71 @xmath5 .",
    "this suggests that the agn is heavily absorbed , and probably has an axis close to the plane of the sky .",
    ".   one possible explanation of the cool gas observed in the temperature analysis is that it is stripped material which has settled along its equal entropy surface to form a shell .",
    "however , the mass of gas is relatively large , stripping mechanisms are thought to be relatively inefficient in the group environment , and the galaxies which might be the source of the material are both distant and unlikely to have possessed sufficient hot gas .",
    "it is also possible that the timescale over which conduction would heat the cool shell is short enough that the other galaxies in the group would be unrealistic as sources of the stripped gas .",
    "an alternative is that the temperature features represent a cool core which has been partially reheated by agn activity . in its current quiescent state ,",
    "the agn is unlikely to provide the energy required for such heating , therefore it seems probable that it underwent a period of enhanced activity in the recent past . if this explanation is accurate , we are observing the group at a very unusual period in its history , when the effects of both cooling an heating are visible .",
    "the lack of other systems with similar temperature structure would then be unsurprising . in our opinion , this is the more likely scenario .",
