    "supernovae ( sne ) are suggested to be the first molecular factories in the early universe @xcite .",
    "molecules such as carbon monoxide ( co ) are sensitive diagnostics of the temperature , density , and degree of mixing in the sn ejecta .",
    "understanding the chemistry within the ejecta , and the abundance and mixing of co and sio molecules , is particularly important in studying dust formation processes since this controls how much carbon is available to form amorphous c grains and how much oxygen available beyond that bound in co and sio molecules to form mgsio@xmath3 and mg@xmath4sio@xmath5 .",
    "the existence of co in supernova ejecta suggests that dust formation can occur , since molecules are indicative of relatively cool ejecta ( typically few thousand degrees ) .",
    "co itself is an effective coolant @xcite , so that once it forms it could enhance dust formation .",
    "isotopic compositions of meteoric dust grains @xcite show that carbon - rich dust is condensed within the interior of supernova ejecta . in o - rich ejecta ,",
    "radioactivity and mixing processes produce ` free ' carbon in which to form dust .",
    "the _ quantity _ of dust formed within sne ejecta has become a subject of debate in recent years ( see rho et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ; dunne et al .",
    "@xcite first showed evidence , in _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) images , for dust formation in the nearby , young supernova remnant ( snr ) cas a. @xcite identified three distinct ejecta dust populations based on their continuum shapes in _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "spectra , including broad features peaking at 21@xmath0 m and estimated a total dust mass of between 0.02 to @xmath6 .",
    "these observations provide definitive evidence of freshly - formed dust in a young supernova remnant and show that sne are important dust contributors to the large quantities of dust observed at high redshifts .",
    "theoretical models @xcite predict a dust mass of 0.3 - 1 m@xmath7 per sn .",
    "however , our current understanding of dust chemistry and composition is limited .",
    "the current models assume that very little carbon is locked up in co and almost all of carbon is available for dust formation .",
    "the results from dust evolution models therefore depend significantly on the c / o ratio in the gas ( see morgan & edmunds 2003 and dwek et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "images obtained with the _ spitzer _  infrared array camera ( irac ) each present a different view of the nucleosynthesis within cas a @xcite .",
    "a surprising result from the irac observations is the similarity between the morphology of the irac band 2 image ( centered at 4.5 @xmath0 m ) and ejecta - dominated images of the remnant .",
    "the origin of this emission is not known , but based on the lack of bright h@xmath8 emission , the contribution from br@xmath8 emission is likely small .",
    "@xcite therefore suspected that co emission was responsible for the emission at this wavelength , but could not be confirmed since the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) has a blue cutoff of 5.2 @xmath0 m .",
    "as a tracer of gas properties and dust formation , co is potentially an important diagnostic for any supernova .",
    "the first detection of co from supernova ejecta was from the well - studied , type ii supernova , sn1987a @xcite , providing an unique insight into the chemical dynamics of the explosion and ejecta .",
    "the variation of the observed co emission with time after the inital explosion was modeled by @xcite , who suggested that co formed out in the sn ejecta at a temperature of 1800k and expansion velocity 1200 km  s@xmath9 at 337 days after the explosion .",
    "they determined a total mass @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite detected @xmath11 of co forming at temperature 4000k in sn 1995ad .",
    "co has further been detected from the type iin sn 1998s @xcite , sn 2002dh @xcite , and the type ic sn 2000ew @xcite .",
    "the number of co detections in sne in the literature is still relatively small , and all are restricted to within a few years after the initial explosion . in this _ letter _ , we report the likely detection of the co overtone from cas a , an approximately 300-yr old supernova remnant .",
    "this is the first time co emission has been detected in a galactic supernova remnant and suggests that molecule formation is not only a common occurrence in core - collapse ejecta but molecules also exist ( or continue forming ) long after the initial explosion event .",
    "we observed cas a on 2006 , september 3 and 4 with the wide field infrared camera ( wirc , wilson et al .",
    "2003 ) on the hale 200 inch ( 5 m ) telescope at mount palomar .",
    "the weather was very clear with the seeing typically 0.8@xmath12 .",
    "the camera field of view is @xmath13 .",
    "we observed a set of dithered positions ( designed to uniformly cover the supernova remnant ) , with interleaved , dithered observations of an ` off ' position @xmath14 away .",
    "a sky reference image was generated from the ` off ' images , and was subtracted from the ` on ' images after scaling to match the median sky brightness .",
    "this observation and analysis procedure preserved the diffuse emission of the snr .",
    "we took narrow - band images using filters centered on co(2 - 0 ) at 2.294 @xmath0 m , k - band and h - band continuum at 2.270 and 1.570 @xmath0 m , and p@xmath15 at 1.182 @xmath0 m  ( see figure [ casacothreecolor ] ) .",
    "the narrow - band filter widths are typically 0.025 @xmath0 m .",
    "the exposure time of co , k - cont and p@xmath15 is a combined 90 sec from three back - to - back images of 30 sec exposure ( to reduce the number of saturated stars ) , with a total on - source integration time of 8100 sec for co , 7290 sec for k - cont and 810 sec for p@xmath15 image .",
    "the exposure time of h - cont is 90 sec , with a total on - source integration time of 1440 sec .",
    "respective sensitivities of the narrow - filter images are 1.70@xmath1610@xmath17 @xmath18 for co , 1.04@xmath1610@xmath17 for k - cont , 1.54@xmath1610@xmath17 for h - cont , and 1.25@xmath1610@xmath19 for p@xmath15 .",
    "the detailed data reduction methods are similar to those described in @xcite ; additionally , focal plane distortion was derived from the images and corrected .",
    "we directly subtracted the k - continuum image from the co filter image in order to subtract stars and contamination from synchrotron emission from cas a @xcite .",
    "due to excellent seeing ( 0.8@xmath12 ) and low airmass towards cas a , the stars were well subtracted .",
    "we further masked saturated stars and applied adaptive smoothing and wavelet filtering to the images .",
    "figure [ casacothreecolor ] shows a color composite image of cas a , combining the p@xmath15 line ( blue ) , 2.27 @xmath0 m  continuum ( green ) , and co ( 2 - 0 ) 2.29 @xmath0 m  line ( red ) .",
    "p@xmath15 traces recombining atomic hydrogen .",
    "the 2.27 @xmath0 m  continuum consists mostly of non - thermal synchrotron radiation and delineates the shell structure ( see rho et al .",
    "finally , the co ( 2 - 0 ) overtone emission traces the dense knots of gas along the shell and interior interface .",
    "the molecular emission is evident as red in figure [ casacothreecolor ] and more easily seen in the continuum - subtracted co image , figure [ casacoonly ] , revealing the line emission towards the northern parts of bright rings and an eastern filament of the minkowski knots in the southeast .",
    "the co emission is highly clumpy and distributed in a collection of knots with an upper limit on the size of @xmath20 pc ( limited by the spatial resolution of @xmath21 ) at a distance @xmath22 kpc @xcite .",
    "the flux densities for the dense gas knots are listed in table 1 .",
    "we selected the brightest knots of 18 regions in the co , k - continuum or p@xmath15 images with angular sizes 3@xmath1215@xmath12 and estimated the flux densities after background subtraction .",
    "the regions include knots which are bright in the continuum - subtracted co image and the flux densities of individual knots range from 0.1 to 0.3 mjy .",
    "the flux densities of two representative co knots and one other knot in the nw are given in table 1 along with the positions .",
    "the total flux density of the co - detected area after k - continuum subtraction ( see fig . 2a and 2c ) , is 1.27@xmath230.17 mjy , where the estimated error includes calibration ( 7% ) , background variation ( 5% ) and statistical ( 10% ) errors .",
    "some faint , diffuse co emission from the cas a may have been removed from our image because of the continuum subtraction ; the flux reported here is conservative , including only the bright knots . after extinction correction using a@xmath24 of 4.5 mag @xcite and the extinction law of @xcite ,",
    "the flux density is 2.03@xmath230.27 mjy , equivalent to a co overtone luminosity of 0.01@xmath230.0014 d@xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "the ratio of h - continuum to k - continuum is globally consistent with the origin of synchrotron radiation with a synchrotron index of 0.65 - 0.71 ( rho et al .",
    "2003 ) ; moreover , the h - continuum and k - continuum images are similar to the radio image @xcite , indicating they are dominated by synchrotron emission .",
    "we compiled spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of near - infrared h and k bands and _ spitzer _  irac bands 1 to 3 ( 3.6 - 5.8 @xmath0 m ) bands for 18 knots ; figure [ casacosed ] shows three representative seds after correcting for the extinction .",
    "the seds show a sudden jump at 2.294 @xmath0 m  toward the co detection positions , with no such jump toward the nw ejecta position .",
    "the seds of the co knots also show a larger irac band 2 ( 4.5 @xmath0 m ) excess than that of the nw ejecta knot .    a few knots towards p@xmath15 emitting regions ( blue in figure 1 ) show k - continuum brighter than the co - band emission .",
    "these knots look like elliptical spheroids , indicative of quasi stationary flocculi ( fesen & gunderson 1996 , willingale et al .",
    "we further note that h - continuum emission towards hydrogen knots is slightly higher than that expected from synchrotron emission , suggesting that despite the narrow bandwidth of h - continuum filter , the image may be picking up the weak hydrogen line br@xmath27 at 1.57 @xmath0 m .",
    "the co filter does not include any hydrogen or helium lines .",
    "the near - infrared spectra of @xcite did not detect any hydrogen and helium lines within the h - cont , k - cont , co filters , but our images have a higher sensitivity and therefore may be detecting such lines .",
    "the p@xmath15 emission is largely from shocked circumstellar gas , and similar to the optical h@xmath8 emission @xcite .",
    "the emission is mainly clustered in the northern - most inner shell and outside the southwestern shell , as shown in figure [ casacothreecolor ] .",
    "the former contains both circumstellar gas and fast moving knots .",
    "the hydrogen lines of circumstellar medium knots also show moderate high velocity components , which are defined as @xmath28mixed emitting knots@xmath29 by @xcite , who discussed their origin .",
    "in particular , rich infrared ejecta emission is detected from the northern most inner shell ( see figure 2 of rho et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that mixed emitting knots may be @xmath28splatter@xmath29 fragments produced as high speed underlying core condensations broke through and partially mixed with the progenitor star s surface layers .",
    "we detected significant near - infrared co overtone emission from small portions of the cas a remnant towards the northern part of the bright ring and in the eastern region of minkowski knots in the southeast .",
    "it is possible that we are missing fainter co emission elsewhere in the snr due to our detection limit ( of 1.98@xmath1610@xmath17 @xmath30 ) in the continuum - subtracted co image .",
    "the locations where co emission is detected coincide with the ejecta at the reverse shock @xcite .",
    "it indicates that the co gas was formed in the ejecta .",
    "the _ spitzer _  irac band 2 image shows a morphology similar to ejecta - dominated images , but the origin of this emission was a mystery . after scaling from the overtone to fundamental band ,",
    "our observations suggest that the co fundamental contributes some ( @xmath311/6 ) but possibly not all of the emission in irac band 2 ( figure [ casacosed ] ) .",
    "other contributors to this band include multiple [ fe  ii ] , hydrogen recombination and helium lines .",
    "the ratios of irac 2 and co - filter emission from 18 knots across cas a suggest that co contributes 10 - 30% of the emission in the co emitting regions when compared with non - co emitting ejecta knots .",
    "constraining the percentage of co contribution to the irac band 2 image is difficult since the ratio of the fundamental to the first overtone varies depending on the ejecta temperature and density .",
    "we can not therefore strongly constrain the co contribution to the irac band 2 .",
    "we analyzed the irs spectroscopy cube to find any signature of the fundamental co ( 4.8 - 6 @xmath0 m ) , but the signal - to - noise was too poor .",
    "the _ spitzer_irs data are not sensitive enough to detect this emission ( errors of the irs spectra were 1 - 2 mjy sr@xmath9 , an order of magnitude higher than the typical flux densities of near - infrared co emission ) although there might be some hint for the northern position ( at the position of the strongest 21 @xmath0 m  dust spectrum ) .",
    "we also looked for sio molecules ( at 8 - 10 @xmath0 m ) , but could not distinguish them from the silicate emission feature at 9.8 @xmath0 m  ( silicate stretching mode ) .",
    "we estimated the mass of co in cas a by comparing the co flux density in cas a with that found in the supernova sn 1987a , since without spectra it is not possible to derive a density , temperature , and velocity of co gas .",
    "figure [ casacosed ] compares the co emission from cas a and sn 1987a @xcite . after accounting for the distance differences ,",
    "the co ( 2 - 0 ) first overtone flux density of cas a is a factor of @xmath32 smaller than that of sn1987a on day 255 .",
    "assuming the same gaseous conditions as seen in the co emitting regions in sn1987a ( a temperature of 1800 - 2800 k and a velocity of 2000 km  s@xmath9 ) , we estimated the co mass in cas a to be @xmath33 for local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) @xcite and @xmath34 for non - lte @xcite .",
    "note that the co mass estimate is highly uncertain because we assume the gas properties described above .",
    "the co detections in sne have been within a few years after the initial explosion .",
    "the main destruction process of co is from impacts with energetic electrons @xcite and with ionized gas atoms .",
    "the latter process quickly destroys co , hence the detection of the co fundamental band provides constraints on the degree of mixing in the sn ejecta .",
    "given that cas a is believed to be the remnant of a type iib explosion ( krause et al .",
    "2008 ) , this suggests that either the co layer is not macroscopically mixed with ionised helium or that the helium is not ionised .",
    "typical electron density of c- and o - rich regions during formation of co is shown to be 5@xmath1610@xmath35 @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the highly clumpy structures can be explained by such high density co gas within the warm or hot ejecta , which naturally fortifies the evidence of fresh dust formation observed in cas a @xcite .    in dust evolution models ,",
    "understanding co molecules in sn ejecta is a key physical question .",
    "the formation efficiency of co molecules critically affects the dust formation efficiency . in chemical equilibrium",
    ", the abundance of co is balanced between radiative processes and radioactive decay fo @xmath37co , because the main destruction process is by the energetic electrons produced by the radioactive decay of @xmath37co @xcite .",
    "both nozawa et al . ( 2003 ) and @xcite assumed the mass fraction of c atoms that are not locked in co is 99 - 100% , and @xcite assumed that mixing occurs at the molecular level , prior to dust condensation .",
    "in contrast , clayton & nittler ( 2004 ) , deneault , clayton & heger ( 2003 ) , and @xcite suggest that gases are unlikely to be mixed at the molecular level within a few years .",
    "our co detection suggests that molecular mixing is small ( at least smaller than previously thought ) in the sn ejecta and during the development of the reverse shock .",
    "co molecules in cas a suggests a higher co abundance in the gas phase and lower efficiency in dust formation of carbon dust .",
    "remaining molecules also indicate that dust formation was inefficient ( leaving molecular leftovers ) or occurred inhomogeneously ( e.g. only in dense knots ) .",
    "deep infrared spectroscopic observations will allow us to measure the velocity , temperature and density of the co molecules in cas a and to study the on - going chemistry of molecules in sn ejecta .",
    "we detected carbon monoxide emission from the young supernova remnant cas a. this may be the first co detection from an older sn ( age @xmath1300 yr ) . co emission has also been detected in 8 other core - collapse remnants , but in all cases it has been limited to within 3 years of the explosion .",
    "theoretical models suggest that dust formation in sne occurs between 200 - 800 days after the sn event yet the observations presented here suggest that molecular and dust formation processes could continue long after .",
    "the detection of co in the cas a remnant demonstrates that astrochemical processes are still on - going more than 300 years after the initial explosion .",
    "we are grateful to achim tappe who participated in the palomar observing run , and thank takashi onaka for fruitful discussion on dust and co formation .",
    "we also thank palomar observatory staff ( jean mueller , jeff hickey and karl dunscombe ) for assistance during our observing runs .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for careful reading and helpful comments .",
    "h. gomez would like to thank las cumbres observatory for their support .",
    "m. andersen is partially supported by nasa through ltsa grant nra-01 - 01-ltsa-013 . based on observations obtained at the hale telescope , palomar observatory as part of a continuing collaboration between the california institute of technology , nasa / jpl , and cornell university .",
