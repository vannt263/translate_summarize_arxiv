    "in order to derive a presentation for a groupoid @xmath3 , one usually needs to introduce a normal form for elements of @xmath4 written in terms of some generators .",
    "such a normal form is not easy to find when @xmath4 is not commutative , and even more so when @xmath4 is not associative .",
    "once a normal form is found , it might be still difficult to come up with presenting relations .",
    "indeed , it is often the case that the only known presentation for a non - associative groupoid is the _ table presentation _ , i.e. , the presentation consisting of all relations @xmath5 such that @xmath6 equals @xmath7 in @xmath4 , and where @xmath8 , @xmath9 run over all elements of @xmath4 .",
    "table presentations are extremely useful when one constructs a multiplication table for @xmath4 , however , they are of little use when one needs to identify @xmath4 as a subgroupoid of another groupoid . to do the latter , it is necessary , in principle , to evaluate all products @xmath6 with @xmath8 , @xmath10 .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have access to presentations with a few presenting relations .",
    "the infinite class of moufang loops @xmath0 , defined below , represents a significant portion of non - associative moufang loops of small order .",
    "we derive compact presentations for @xmath0 for every finite , two - generated group @xmath1 .",
    "thirty years ago , chein and pflugfelder @xcite proved that the smallest non - associative moufang loop is of order @xmath11 and is unique up to isomorphism .",
    "it coincides with @xmath12 .",
    "guided by our presentation for @xmath13 , we give a new , visual description of @xmath13 in the last section .",
    "a loop @xmath15 is _ moufang _ if it satisfies one of the three equivalent _ moufang identities _",
    "@xmath16 in fact , it is not necessary to assume that @xmath17 possesses a neutral element . by a result of kunen @xcite ,",
    "every quasigroup satisfying one of the moufang identities is necessarily a ( moufang ) loop .",
    "every element @xmath8 of a moufang loop has a two - sided inverse @xmath18 .",
    "also , moufang loops are _ diassociative _ , i.e , every two - generated subloop is a group .",
    "we will use these well - known properties of moufang loops without warning throughout the paper .",
    "the following construction is due to o.  chein @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite group of order @xmath19 .",
    "pick a new element @xmath20 , and define @xmath21 where @xmath22 then @xmath0 is a moufang loop of order @xmath23 .",
    "it is associative if and only if @xmath1 is commutative .",
    "let @xmath24 be the number of isomorphism types of non - associative moufang loops of order at most @xmath25 , and let @xmath26 be the number of non - associative loops of the form @xmath0 of order at most @xmath25 . then , according to chein s classification @xcite , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "( as orin chein kindly notified me , edgar goodaire noticed that the loop @xmath31 is missing in @xcite .",
    "he also observed that @xmath32 is isomorphic to @xmath33 , and @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "that is why @xmath36 equals @xmath37 , rather than @xmath38 . )",
    "this demonstrates eloquently the abundance of loops of type @xmath0 among moufang loops of small order .",
    "we start with the table presentation @xmath39 for @xmath0 and prove    [ th : main ] let @xmath40 be a presentation for a finite group @xmath1 , where @xmath41 is a set of relations in generators @xmath8 , @xmath9 . then @xmath0 is presented by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the neutral element of @xmath1 .",
    "let us emphasize that @xmath44 is a presentation in the _ variety of moufang loops _",
    ", not groups .",
    "the complicated multiplication formula @xmath39 merely describes the four cases @xmath45 in a compact way .",
    "in particular , identities @xmath46 and @xmath47 imply @xmath48 we claim that @xmath49 is equivalent to @xmath39 .",
    "an element @xmath50 will be called _ good _ if @xmath51 can be derived from @xmath44 .",
    "[ lm : equiv ] if @xmath52 is good , then @xmath47 holds .",
    "if @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 are good , then @xmath56 holds . if @xmath53 , @xmath57 are good , then @xmath46 holds .",
    "we have @xmath58 if @xmath54 is good .",
    "assume that @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath59 are good",
    ". then @xmath60 . finally , when @xmath53 and @xmath57 are good , we derive @xmath61 .",
    "thus @xmath49 is equivalent to @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , in order to prove theorem [ th : main ] , it suffices to show that every @xmath50 is good .",
    "thanks to diassociativity , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 positive integer ) is good whenever @xmath53 is . since @xmath1 is finite , @xmath64 is good whenever @xmath53 is .",
    "[ lm : swap ] assume that @xmath53 , @xmath52 are good",
    ". then @xmath65 is good if and only if @xmath59 is .",
    "because of the symmetry , it is enough to prove only one implication .",
    "assume that @xmath59 is good .",
    "by lemma [ lm : equiv ] , @xmath66 . using this identity , we obtain @xmath67 , thus @xmath68 , and so @xmath69 .",
    "[ lm : up ] assume that @xmath53 , @xmath52 are good .",
    "then so is @xmath70 .    since @xmath64 , @xmath54 are good , lemma [ lm : equiv ] yields @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath72 , and we are done .",
    "we continue by induction on the _ complexity _ , or _ length _ , if you will , of the elements of @xmath1 , defined below .    for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , let @xmath75 be the set of symbols @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and write @xmath79 .",
    "every word @xmath80 of the free group @xmath81 can be written uniquely in the form @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is a non - zero integer .",
    "define the _ complexity _ of @xmath80 as the ordered pair @xmath85 , and order the complexities lexicographically .    from now on , assume that @xmath1 is two - generated , and write @xmath86 , @xmath87 .    since @xmath88 and @xmath89 are presenting relations , both @xmath8 , @xmath9 are good , and hence both @xmath90 , @xmath91 are good for every integer @xmath63 .",
    "the last presenting relation @xmath92 shows that both @xmath93 and @xmath94 are good .",
    "then @xmath95 and @xmath96 are good , by lemma [ lm : swap ] .",
    "also , lemma [ lm : up ] implies that @xmath97 is good .",
    "then @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are good , by lemma [ lm : swap ] .",
    "this means that every @xmath50 with @xmath101 is good .",
    "[ lm : middlestep ] every @xmath50 with @xmath102 is good .",
    "suppose there is @xmath53 that is not good , and let @xmath103 be as small as possible .",
    "we can assume that @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "either @xmath108 or @xmath109 . without loss of generality , @xmath110 .",
    "( by lemma [ lm : swap ] , we can assume that @xmath108 .",
    "when @xmath20 is negative , consider the inverse @xmath111 instead , and apply lemma [ lm : swap ] again . ) since @xmath112 , the element @xmath113 is good , and so is @xmath114 .",
    "as @xmath115 is good by the induction hypothesis , @xmath116 is good as well , by lemma [ lm : up ] .",
    "then the decomposition of @xmath117 into @xmath118 demonstrates that @xmath119 is good , by lemma [ lm : swap ] .",
    "we have reached a contradiction .",
    "to finish the proof , assume there is @xmath50 that is not good , and let @xmath103 be as small as possible . by lemma [ lm : middlestep ] , @xmath120 .",
    "when @xmath121 is odd , we can write @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath105 . since @xmath125 , @xmath126 , both @xmath127 , @xmath54 are good , and then @xmath53 is good by lemma [ lm : up ] .",

    "the multiplication formula @xmath39 for @xmath12 is certainly difficult to memorize , and so is the one in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example iv.1.2 ) .",
    "we present a visual description of @xmath13 .",
    "note that there are @xmath131 involutions and @xmath132 elements of order @xmath133 in @xmath13 ( cf .",
    "* table 3 ) ) .",
    "we are going to define a @xmath11-element groupoid @xmath17 and show that it is isomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "look at the four diagrams in figure [ fg : m12 ] .",
    "think of the vertices @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 as involutions .",

    "interpret the edges of diagrams i  iv as multiplication rules in the following way .",
    "if @xmath139 and @xmath140 are connected by a solid line , let @xmath141 be the third vertex of the ( unique ) triangle containing both @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "if @xmath139 and @xmath140 are not connected by a solid line , we must have @xmath142 , and then @xmath139 and @xmath140 are connected by a dotted line ( in diagram iii ) .",

    "obviously , @xmath17 is closed under multiplication and has a neutral element .",
    "it is non - associative , since @xmath147 .",
    "is @xmath17 isomorphic to @xmath13 ? there is a unique moufang loop of order @xmath11 @xcite , so it suffices to check the moufang identities for @xmath17 .",
    "however , this is not so easy !",
    "instead , we verify directly that @xmath17 satisfies the multiplication formula @xmath39 with some choice of @xmath1 and @xmath20 .",
