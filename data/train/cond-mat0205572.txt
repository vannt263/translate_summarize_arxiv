    "the localization model introduced by anderson  @xcite incorporates two basic elements , namely the rules of quantum mechanics applied to a single - electron , tight - binding model hamiltonian , plus quenched disorder ( realized , e.g. , by assigning random self - energies to lattice sites ) .",
    "its original purpose was to show the existence of a disorder - induced transition in three - dimensional systems , from metallic ( diffusive ) to insulating ( localized ) electronic behavior , upon increasing randomness . over the years",
    "the model has turned out to exhibit a rich variety of physical aspects , many of them highlighted by the ( single  parameter ) scaling theory of localization ( spst )  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest here is the fact that , in zero magnetic field and in the absence of spin - orbit couplings , spst predicts insulating behavior , for any finite amount of disorder , in spatial dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath6 , though in the marginal case @xmath2 one has borderline phenomena such as weak localization .",
    "interest in the anderson transition has been renewed by reports of metallic behavior in dilute two - dimensional electron - hole systems  @xcite .",
    "while phenomenological , percolation - based theories have been able to reproduce experimentally - observed trends in some detail  @xcite , attempts to reconcile basic theoretical assumptions to experimental evidence have only met limited success so far .",
    "for instance , numerical evidence has been produced  @xcite against the idea that electron - electron interactions ( not included in scaling theory ) might play a role in driving the two - dimensional transition  @xcite .",
    "even when one confines oneself to the original anderson picture of non - interacting electrons in three - dimensional lattices , where the existence of a transition is not questioned , progress towards extracting reliable numerical estimates of critical quantities has been remarkably hard  @xcite .",
    "recently , systematic consideration of irrelevant variables and non - linear corrections to single - parameter scaling  @xcite has helped produce results with a fairly reasonable claim to consistently narrow error bars .",
    "it is thus of interest to reexamine the basic methods which have been used in the past 20 years , in conjunction with spst , to study the anderson localization problem .",
    "a step in this direction has been given in ref .",
    ", whose authors obtained wave functions via exact diagonalization , for both one - dimensional and finite , @xmath7 , two - dimensional systems . by averaging over randomness ,",
    "they obtained probability distributions of wavefunction amplitudes on sites at varying distances from an arbitrary origin .",
    "such distributions were compared to predictions from spst ; though agreement was good in @xmath1 , the two - dimensional results were in contradiction to the idea of a single localization length depending only on disorder intensity : instead , a clear logarithmic increase with distance , at fixed disorder , was found from their fits for that quantity .    in ref .",
    ", finite - size effects were avoided in @xmath2 by considering disorder strengths such that the corresponding localization length , as predicted by single - parameter theory , is @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) , and using suitably large systems with @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "numerous studies of the anderson transition are set up on quasi - one dimensional geometries , for ease of application of transfer - matrix ( tm ) or recursive green s functions methods  @xcite ; extrapolation to bulk behavior ( @xmath2 or @xmath10 as the case may be ) is then performed with help of finite - size scaling theory  @xcite .",
    "here we consider tm methods , applied both to strictly one - dimensional systems and to strips of a square lattice .",
    "traditionally the tm approach has been used to calculate lyapunov exponents ( directly related to the localization length of spst )  @xcite , and quantities obtainable from such exponents , e.g. , conductances  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ method ] we recall how wavefunction amplitudes may be estimated in the tm context , and illustrate our approach in the simple @xmath1 case by rederiving the corresponding distributions found in ref .  . in sec .",
    "[ twod ] , an analogous treatment is developed for strips of a two - dimensional square lattice , and numerical results are displayed and discussed .",
    "conclusions and final remarks are given in sec .",
    "we consider the site - disordered anderson model , for which the tight - binding hamiltonian is written as @xmath11 where the site self - energies @xmath12 are independent , identically distributed random variables obeying a specified distribution , @xmath13 denotes nearest - neighbor sites on a regular lattice , and the energy scale is set by the hopping matrix element , @xmath14 .",
    "disorder intensity is given by the width @xmath15 of the self - energy probability distribution , taken here as rectangular ( same as in ref .  ):",
    "@xmath16    in the tm approach  @xcite , one considers the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) on a quasi - one dimensional @xmath17 system , @xmath18 . denoting by @xmath19 the successive cross - sections , and @xmath20 the respective positions of sites within each cross - section ,",
    "an electronic wave function at energy @xmath21 is given in terms of its local amplitudes , @xmath22 , and tight - binding orbitals @xmath23 , as : @xmath24 with a corresponding change of notation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) reads : @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for nearest - neighbor pairs . applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : h(ik ) ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi(e ) ] ) gives the recursion relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes nearest neighbors of @xmath29 within the same cross - section ( the @xmath21-dependence is omitted for clarity ) .",
    "in matricial form , @xmath30 where , considering , e.g. , periodic boundary conditions across the @xmath31 transverse directions  @xcite , @xmath32 the @xmath33 matrix @xmath34 is symplectic , that is , its eigenvalues occur in pairs @xmath35 . as explained at length in refs .  , the matrix product @xmath36 gives rise to the eigenvalues @xmath37 , where the @xmath38 are the lyapunov characteristic exponents ( lce ) for the problem , setting the asymptotic divergence of the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath39 .",
    "being a product of symplectic matrices , @xmath40 also has this property , therefore the lce occur in symmetric pairs @xmath41 .",
    "attention usually concentrates on the lce of smallest modulus , @xmath42 , whose inverse gives the longest decay length ( identified with the localization length of the anderson problem ) .    to see the meaning of the eigenvectors @xmath39 , recall that the physically acceptable ( non - diverging ) wave function is the one associated with the _ negative _ lce of smallest modulus , @xmath43  @xcite ; the corresponding tight - binding amplitudes @xmath44 will give information on the shape of the electronic wave function of interest ( because of the symplectic character of the tm , one might equally consider the _",
    "inverse _ of the amplitudes associated to @xmath42 ; however , in practice the amount of calculational effort is the same either way ) .",
    "little use appears to have been made of this property in the context of tm studies of anderson localization , except for a calculation of lateral transport properties in layered media  @xcite .",
    "it is important to recall that the site amplitudes are not the directly relevant quantities in the tm approach ; instead , in the quasi - one dimensional systems used here the wavefunction decay rate must be defined by comparing the moduli of suitable vectors , each with @xmath45 components  @xcite .",
    "we now take strictly one - dimensional systems , and illustrate how the above ideas work .",
    "the matrices @xmath46 are @xmath47 , and the relevant lce is @xmath48 ; the corresponding wavefunction amplitude at site @xmath49 is @xmath50 . starting with an arbitrary pair of states at neighboring sites ,",
    "say @xmath51 , we first iterate eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix ] ) a number @xmath52 of times , taking care to orthonormalize the resulting vectors every @xmath53 steps ( typically , @xmath54 ; we have used @xmath55 , but other authors have used @xmath56 apparently without noticeable deterioration of results  @xcite ) . with such initialization the starting vectors are rotated in hilbert space towards the asymptotic direction of the eigenvectors of @xmath40 .",
    "having done this , we rename the current site as the origin . recalling from eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix ] ) that the vectors being iterated involve both @xmath57 and @xmath58 , one sees that the appropriate quantities to keep track of are the @xmath59 ^ 2+[a_{k+1}^{(2)}]^2\\}^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "one might visualize the process as follows : starting from the pair of site amplitudes @xmath60 , one iteratively obtains the pair @xmath61 and so on , until ( after @xmath62 iterations of @xmath63 ) one gets the pair @xmath64 .",
    "this latter is legitimately said to be at a distance @xmath62 from the origin , that is , from the original pair of sites .",
    "we then start to accumulate the products of successive amplitudes @xmath65 at each @xmath53 steps ( _ after _ orthogonalization , but _ before _",
    "normalization ) . at distance @xmath62 from the new origin ,",
    "the ( relative ) wavefunction amplitude is given by @xmath66 where the notation of ref .",
    "is used for ease of comparison , @xmath67 ^ 2+[\\psi_{k+1}]^2\\}^{1/2}$ ] , and the fact that we always make @xmath55 has been taken into account . in order to generate statistics of the @xmath68 for a set of distances @xmath69 , one iterates the tm for @xmath70 steps , collecting data at the specified points ; to collect the next sample , it suffices to keep iterating for another @xmath71 steps , with no need to reinitialize the wave functions , and so on .",
    "after a total of @xmath72 iterations of the tm , one has @xmath73 samples of the @xmath68 for each distance of interest , the corresponding histograms @xmath74 for @xmath75 , disorder strength @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "these values of the parameters were chosen in order to enable comparison with the exact diagonalization results displayed in figure 1 of ref .  .",
    "indeed , one finds excellent visual agreement between the respective data sets .",
    "numerical analysis of the first three moments of our histograms shows that : ( i ) for all three distances , they are well - fitted by gaussians of the form @xmath81\\ , \\label{eq : gfit1d}\\ ] ] with @xmath82 , @xmath83 , which are in rather good agreement with the expected values from spst  @xcite in the limit @xmath84 , respectively @xmath85 , @xmath86 ; and ( ii ) the dimensionless skewness @xmath4 , defined as  @xcite : @xmath87 for a distribution with mean @xmath88 and dispersion @xmath89 , has the following values : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 respectively for @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .    point ( ii ) is further indication that the wavefunction amplitude distribution indeed approaches a log - normal shape ( zero skewness ) , but only as @xmath93 . the approximate dependence on @xmath62 may be inferred as @xmath94 , from the 3 data just quoted .",
    "we now extend our approach to strips of a square lattice . for a strip of width @xmath95 , the matrices @xmath46 are @xmath96 , and",
    "the relevant lce is @xmath97 ; the corresponding wavefunction amplitudes at column @xmath49 are @xmath98 , @xmath99 . taking into account the normalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix ] ) , the appropriate decay factor here is @xmath100",
    "^ 2\\,\\right)^{1/2 } \\ \\ ( d=2 ) .",
    "\\label{eq : a(r)2d}\\ ] ] it must be stressed that eq .",
    "( [ eq : a(r)2d ] ) is not meant to imply an averaging process over site amplitudes @xmath101 ; as remarked above , these @xmath102 quantities are not the directly relevant ones . instead",
    ", they give the modulus of the eigenvector associated to the negative lce of smallest absolute value  @xcite , whose decay is to be followed .",
    "we have considered strips of even widths @xmath103 sites and periodic boundary conditions across , and taken the disorder intensity @xmath104 , in order to make contact with analogous results in ref .  .",
    "for this value of @xmath15 spst predicts the localization length to be @xmath105  @xcite .",
    "spst , together with finite - size scaling  @xcite would imply that @xmath106 in order to infer the @xmath2 behavior , one must consider the regime @xmath62 , @xmath107 , @xmath108  @xcite . although tm methods make it easy to explore long distances ( @xmath109 ) along the `` infinite '' direction , this fact is not directly relevant here , as the corresponding regime would be one where strictly one - dimensional features emerge . in the following",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to @xmath110 and @xmath111 ; according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : spst2d ] ) , for each value of @xmath112 one should then be able to collapse all distributions against @xmath113 .",
    "again , we have examined the first three moments of the distributions thus generated . using only the first two , we have fitted data to gaussians in the manner of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gfit1d ] ) , for which the effective localization lengths @xmath114 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that , for given @xmath95 , the @xmath115 are essentially the same both for @xmath116 and @xmath95 .",
    "this shows that crude finite - size distortions do not play a role for the ranges of @xmath62 and @xmath95 used . on the other hand , similarly to the findings of ref .",
    "and against the prediction of spst , there is no single value of @xmath115 to fit all distributions ; instead , it grows with increasing @xmath62 .",
    "however , our result differs from that of ref .",
    ", in that the dependence of @xmath115 is clearly not linear in @xmath117 .",
    "this should not be seen as a direct contradiction , as the quantities under study are not identical ( as was the case in @xmath1 ): though they represent the same physical phenomenon of wavefunction decay , they do so in rather different geometries .    as regards the width of distribution @xmath118 ( again taking eq .",
    "( [ eq : gfit1d ] ) as a starting point ) our results , displayed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , exhibit numerical values not unlike those found in ref .  , in the sense of being consistently smaller than the spst prediction @xmath85 , but with the same order of magnitude .",
    "one might expect that , for larger @xmath62 , @xmath95 the decreasing trend observed for @xmath119 would stabilize close to @xmath120 quoted in ref .  .",
    "this , however , we have no means to ascertain at present .",
    "we have not been able to fit the full range of data by a single power of either @xmath95 or @xmath117 ; assuming , e.g. , @xmath121 , the best result from a nonlinear least - squares fit gives @xmath122 , corresponding to the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "it is evident , from the figure , that the trend for large @xmath95 is towards an even slower variation .    at this point , one might speculate that @xmath115 , as given by the gaussian fits , could eventually saturate for larger @xmath95 , at a value which might even be close to the spst prediction .",
    "however , we shall now show that the gaussian fits themselves become increasingly unable to reflect the properties of the wavefunction amplitude distributions .",
    "indeed , we have found that the skewness of distributions is negative , and _",
    "increases _ in absolute value as @xmath62 , @xmath95 grow . as an example ,",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows the raw data for @xmath123 , @xmath124 , together with the corresponding gaussian fit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gfit1d ] ) , obtained using the first and second moments of the distribution .",
    "the effect of negative skewness is apparent in that the gaussian approximation overshoots the data for large @xmath125 ( i.e. , predicts a _ small _ amplitude to occur _ more frequently _ than observed in fact ) , and undershoots for small @xmath125 ( predicts a _ large _ amplitude to occur _ less frequently _ than observed ) .",
    "skewness data for the ranges of @xmath62 and @xmath95 used here are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , together with fits of single - power forms , @xmath126 , for the subsets corresponding respectively to @xmath127 ( dashed line , @xmath128 ) and @xmath116 ( full line , @xmath129 ) . despite the large amount of scatter , the increasing trend against growing @xmath62 , @xmath95 is unmistakably present .",
    "this means , in turn , that for larger and larger systems the distributions become ever less amenable to fitting by gaussians , as predicted by spst .",
    "this would remain true even if a hypothetical saturation should occur for values of @xmath62 and @xmath95 larger than those investigated here .",
    "recall , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : skewdef ] ) , that skewness is invariant under the usual histogram - collapse rescaling  @xcite , @xmath130 , where the shifted variable is @xmath131/\\sqrt{\\sigma   r/\\lambda ( r)}$ ] . therefore , this is a legitimate extra parameter to characterize the distributions .",
    "similar results were found experimentally , for the conductance distribution in quasi - one dimensional gold wires  @xcite .",
    "negative skewness of wavefunction amplitude distributions works in the same way as ( in the limited context of gaussian fits ) does the finding that @xmath132 increases with @xmath62 : both contribute to a slower decay of electronic wave functions , compared with the constant-@xmath115 , zero - skewness , spst picture .",
    "of course , the evidence just presented is not enough to argue that there must be a localization - delocalization transition in @xmath2 ; the idea that this is the borderline dimensionality , as predicted by spst , most likely holds true .",
    "nonetheless , we have shown robust evidence for deviations from spst in @xmath2 , whose consequences still have to be worked out in full ,",
    "we have made use of suitable properties of the vectors which are iterated in the tm approach to anderson localization  @xcite , in order to generate the statistical distribution of electronic wavefunction amplitudes at sites of @xmath0 disordered systems .",
    "we have considered @xmath1 ( for which our approach is shown to reproduce the exact diagonalization results of ref .  ) , and @xmath2 . in the latter case , since the @xmath133 geometry of our systems differs from that ( @xmath7 ) of ref .",
    ", a perfect match is not to be expected ; however , some basic physical properties are found to hold for both cases . in particular , attempted fits of gaussian ( log - normal ) forms to the wavefunction amplitude distributions result in effective localization lengths growing with distance , contrary to the spst prediction .",
    "we have gone further , and shown that the distributions possess a negative skewness , which is invariant under the usual histogram - collapse rescaling , and increases with distance ( at least for the range of parameters used in our study ) .",
    "such deviations from the expected behavior are evidence of slower decay of electronic wavefunctions than predicted by spst ; it still must be worked out whether or not some phenomena specific to @xmath2 , such as weak localization , or the recently - observed metal - insulator transition in dilute two - dimensional dilute electron - hole systems  @xcite , carry the fingerprints of the anomalies reported here .",
    "we expect that the present results may motivate further work along these lines .",
