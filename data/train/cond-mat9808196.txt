    "charge transport in structures with fractional dimensionality has attracted a high degree of attention due to both its fundamental and applied interest @xcite .",
    "conductivity of a random fractal of resistors was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite as an example of critical phenomena .",
    "a large body of literature has been devoted to a study of the unusual dynamics of electrons in regular and random fractals @xcite .",
    "the discussion of the questions and appropriate references may be found in recent reviews ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we consider problems of percolation and hopping transport on _ nearly one - dimensional _ strongly anisotropic fractals @xcite with dimensionality @xmath0 .",
    "these fractals are expected to exhibit unique properties because their dimensionality at @xmath5 is close to the low marginal one for the percolation transition .",
    "in contrast to isotropic fractals a small parameter @xmath4 enables us to obtain the exact solution .",
    "moreover it becomes possible in the case of nearly - one - dimensional fractals to establish not only average characteristics but their entire distribution functions .",
    "another motivation for a study of quasi - one - dimensional fractals is recent experimental data on conducting polymers such as doped polyacetylene , polypyrrole and polyaniline @xcite . in general",
    ", this class of polymers has a great variety of transport properties . in the undoped state",
    "these polymers are semiconductors with an energy gap of peierls - mott origin @xcite . with doping the energy gap",
    "is suppressed quickly and for the highly doped case there is finite density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the room temperature conductivity ( @xmath6 ) of heavily doped sample may attain metallic values and temperature and frequency dependencies of conductivity may be close to metallic .",
    "the nature of the metallic phase in these samples is presently a subject of intensive study .",
    "one point is that the metallic state is dependent upon by strong interchain coupling @xcite",
    ".    in doped polymers with moderate @xmath6 ( of the order of several hundreds @xmath7 ) the conductivity , as a rule , decreases with decreasing temperature @xcite .",
    "because this decay follows a power law in a large temperature interval , presumably , these materials are near the metal - insulator transition which happens at the critical interchain coupling . poorly conducting doped samples with @xmath6 of the order or less 1 @xmath7 have behavior that can be classified as `` dielectric '' @xcite : it is similar to that observed in amorphous semiconductors . for such materials ,",
    "dc conductivity is strongly dependent on temperature and , generally , follows : @xmath8 .",
    "it is noted that caution must be made to review a large temperature range in comparison of experimental conductivity with the model dependencies @xcite .",
    "for a variable range hopping ( vrh ) mechanism of transport the temperature dependence of conductivity was initially derived @xcite to be : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is system s dimensionality . for @xmath11",
    "this formula reproduces the observable dependence @xmath12 .",
    "however this approach is not correct , since the 1d vrh @xcite yields the arrhenius law , @xmath13 with @xmath14 set by the highest barrier that occurs in the chain .",
    "the 1d vrh was modified for a quasi-1d system @xcite to include weak hops between the nearest - neighbor , thereby avoiding the highest barriers .",
    "this approximation results in a quasi-1d vrh law , @xmath8",
    ".    experimental measurements of microwave conductivity and dielectric constant in poorly conducting doped samples @xcite revealed that both are strongly dependent upon temperature too , most probably according to the same quasi-1d mott s law , i.e. @xmath15 . the usual theory of hopping transport predicts , however , only a very weak power temperature dependence for the frequency - dependent conductivity and the dielectric constant in two and three  dimensional systems  @xcite .    in the present work we exploit the specific structure of the polymer network to understand these peculiar features of conducting polymers . in stretched polyacetylene this network is formed by coupled polymer chains oriented along some direction .",
    "electron micrographs shows that in these substances polymeric chains are organized into",
    "_ fibrils _",
    "@xcite , which may be distinctly seen to be subdivided into smaller ones @xcite . in a non - fibrillar form of conducting polymers , like polyaniline , x ",
    "rays data reveal the existence of highly ordered `` crystalline regions '' with metallic properties @xcite .",
    "therefore the whole network of stretched polyaniline may be thought of as constructed from long one  dimensional polymer chains randomly coupled by metallic islands of various sizes .",
    "the volume fraction of metallic islands can be small .",
    "we assume here that polymer structure represents a _",
    "nearly one - dimensional fractal_. that means a specific kind of polymer chain organization , defined in the following way : choose a three - dimensional cube with the edge @xmath16 .",
    "chains , which are coupled within this cube , form a set of bundles disconnected from each other .",
    "if for large enough @xmath16 the cross  section of the maximum bundle is proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , then we shall call the system @xmath19 dimensional . obviously @xmath20 for purely one  dimensional systems ( sets of uncoupled chains ) .",
    "note , that if one assume chains to be connected either with a low concentration of uncorrelated interchain links , or with weak links ( their resistivities being high compared to intrachain ones in our example ) , then we are dealing with a _  quasi",
    " one  dimensional _ system   @xcite , which is three  dimensional according to our definition .",
    "the problem of electron localization in similar fractals was studied in refs .",
    "it was found that even in the presence of a weak disorder all the electronic states remain localized as long as @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , a mechanism of charge transport in the fractal with @xmath5 is supposed to be variable range hopping ( vrh ) .",
    "this assumption is in agreement with the experimental observations for poorly conducting highly doped polymers for which there is a finite density of states at the fermi level @xcite .",
    "the usual method to treat vrh models is the effective medium approximation @xcite , which gives wrong results in the nearly1d case .",
    "for example , for the percolation model this method gives the threshold concentration of broken bonds @xmath22 , while @xmath23 , as we shall see later .",
    "the results for critical exponents are also wrong in this approximation . to treat vrh in a nearly one - dimensional fractal we choose the following approach .",
    "we will first study the percolation problem in a nearly-1d fractal exactly .",
    "the vrh model is reduced to the percolation problem by constructing the effective percolation lattice @xcite .    in this way we have found that at low temperatures the vrh conductivity obeys a quasi-1d mott law : @xmath24 but the characteristic temperature @xmath25 is greater than @xmath14 for 1d chain by a factor @xmath26 .",
    "similar temperature dependence is obtained for ac conductivity .",
    "these results can explain the observed temperature dependence of conductivity and dielectric constant in poorly conducting polymers .",
    "additionally it was shown that there is the strong frequency dependence of conductivity in the region of extremely low frequencies .",
    "these peculiarities reflect the fact that in the random fractal with dimensionality close to one the low frequency conductivity is entirely controlled by the weak charge transfer between clusters .",
    "each cluster is very dense and remains well isolated .",
    "there exist several different problems related to the percolation .",
    "first , one can be interested in statistical properties of percolating media : distribution of connected clusters , probability of two or more points to be connected , etc .",
    "as it was shown by fortuin and kastelein @xcite , this problem can be reduced to the @xmath27-component potts model in the limit @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the powerful set of field theory methods may be applied .",
    "this analogy , however , does not allow us to treat the conductivity of a percolating cluster .",
    "the evaluation of the conductivity exponent @xmath29 , which describes the dc conductivity @xmath30 behavior near percolation threshold : @xmath31 is much more complicated task than the `` field - theoretic '' ones , such as the exponents of correlation length and of infinite cluster capacity , etc .    thus our first aim is to study the critical behavior of conductivity near the percolation threshold in a @xmath10dimensional lattice , where @xmath10 is close to lower critical dimensionality , i.e. @xmath32 , @xmath5 .",
    "the real space renormalization group of migdal and kadanoff ( rgmk ) @xcite , being exact at @xmath11 , may be expected to be the appropriate tool as @xmath10 tends to unity .",
    "this method was applied to the percolation problem several years ago by kirkpatrick @xcite .",
    "he had found critical exponents of correlation length and conductivity by using the rg equations for conductivity distribution truncated up to the first moment . though he had not considered explicitly a case of nearly-1d system , this method , if properly applied ,",
    "gives the right dependence of conductivity exponent on @xmath4 except for a pre - exponential factor .",
    "we extend the rgmk method to consider the conductivities and resistivities distribution functions in random media .",
    "this enable us to derive the equation for the conductivity exponent @xmath33 , which gives realistic values not only in the nearly-1d case .",
    "moreover , explicit expressions for the distribution functions at the percolation threshold will be obtained .",
    "to the best of our knowledge only numerical estimates of random conductivity momenta were available until this work ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thorough investigation of the percolation problem and its various modifications is of interest both for its conceptual significance and due to its numerous applications @xcite . beside its application to random conducting media on which we shall concentrate here , the percolation approach was used , e.g. , to treat the rigidity transition in random networks @xcite , and mechanical breakdown in solids @xcite .",
    "another application is the magnetic flux flow in type ii superconductors @xcite . in the case of magnetic vortices",
    "pinned by disorder , their motion just above the depinning threshold happens along a sparse ( possibly , fractal ) network of persistent channels .",
    "directed percolation model is often applied now to describe a wide class of phenomena , in particular , self - organized criticality @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in chapter [ dimen ] the notion of fractional dimensionality is introduced for the oriented chain arrays and illustrated by hierarchical structures . in chapter [ rgmk ] rgmk transformations for conductivity of disordered media and for connectivity of percolation system are derived , the latter one is studied in chapter [ connect ] . the rg equation for the distribution function of conductivity at the percolation threshold",
    "is solved in chapter [ conduct ] , and the explicit form of distribution function is found in chapter [ df ] . using scaling relations ,",
    "results for the ac conductivity of the percolating lattice near threshold are obtained in chapter [ scale ] , and they are applied to describe the temperature and frequency dependence of conductivity for the variable range hopping transport in chapter [ vrh ] .",
    "results are discussed in chapter [ concl ] .",
    "three appendixes contain technical details .",
    "the @xmath34 hierarchical structure ( hs ) is constructed through the infinite repetition of two successive steps ( see fig . [ hs ] ) : a ) construction of @xmath35-chains , and b ) construction of @xmath36-bundles .",
    "after every step the resulting construction may be treated as a new bond ( @xmath37-th level bundles ) .",
    "we use the following definition of dimensionality for a chain fractal considering an array of one - dimensional chains , connected in some regular or random fashion by transverse bonds of various lengths . in an @xmath16-size cube chains form a set of bundles , connected inside this cube . within each bundle in the cube",
    "the chains are interconnected .",
    "there are no connection between the bundles within the @xmath16-size cube . if the number of chains in the maximum sized bundle scales as @xmath17 for large enough @xmath16 , where @xmath38 , then we have @xmath0 dimensional network .",
    "obviously @xmath20 for a purely one  dimensional systems ( sets of disconnected chains ) .",
    "the characteristic feature of the fractals , constructed from oriented 1d chains is their self - similarity : the system at any scale looks like subdivided into bundles , which in turn are subdivided into smaller ones , etc .",
    "in particular , the dimensionality @xmath39 may be ascribed to the @xmath40 hierarchical structure , if in spatial dimension @xmath41 we replace every site with @xmath42 bonds attached to it ( @xmath37 is the level of bundles attached at each side of this site ) with @xmath43 sites connected by transverse bonds of infinite strength ( see example in fig .",
    "[ hsin2d ] ) .",
    "our hypothesis here is that oriented polymer network structures are of this type ( with @xmath0 close to 1 , @xmath5 ) , at least in some wide enough interval of length scales , e.g. from the scale of fibrils ( hundreds of nm ) down to molecular scales .",
    "transmission electron micrographs of fibrillar polyacetylene ( see e.g. @xcite ) appear to support this hypothesis .",
    "of course , the real structures are not regular ones , and the requirement of self - similarity here is to be treated in statistical sense .",
    "nevertheless , we shall use the rgmk scheme , based on regular fractals ( hs ) for their analysis . in the case of conducting polymers such as nonfibrillar doped polyaniline and doped polypyrrole",
    "one may assume the polymer networks apparent fractality in some scale range to be caused by a dilute distribution of crystalline regions providing interchain links ( fractality , generated by randomness @xcite ) .",
    "having in mind that the rgmk is exact in one dimension , one may hope to obtain meaningful results when the dimensionality is close to 1 .",
    "the renormalization group of migdal and kadanoff may be formulated in a quite simple phenomenological fashion .",
    "suppose we have some random @xmath44 -dimensional medium with fluctuating local conductivity / resistivity .",
    "let us consider a @xmath45-size cube within the medium .",
    "its conductance is @xmath46 , where the random conductivity @xmath47 is @xmath45-dependent for strongly inhomogeneous systems .",
    "the distribution function for conductivity and for resistivity @xmath48 are defined in the laplace representation as : @xmath49    if we change the size of the cube , @xmath50 , we arrive at some new random variables @xmath51 , @xmath52 with distribution functions @xmath53 , @xmath54 , respectively . the cube s enhancement may be treated as @xmath55-times expansion in one ( `` longitudal '' ) spatial direction , and in @xmath56 other ( `` transverse '' ) ones .",
    "if one intends to treat these transformations as infinitesimal ones afterwards , the order of operations is not important .",
    "the rgmk scheme is based upon two approximations : i ) enhancing the size @xmath55 times in the longitudinal direction is treated as connection of @xmath55 resistors in series , and ii ) in a similar way , the transverse cube s enhancement is replaced by the parallel connection of @xmath57 elements .",
    "thus we have : @xmath58 here the tilde values refer to the rectangular element with the dimensions @xmath59 in the longitudinal direction and @xmath45 in other ones . in both steps the resistivities @xmath60 and conductivities @xmath61 of the constituent component",
    "are supposed to be independent random variables , and , therefore , we have the distribution functions to be transformed in two steps simply as : @xmath62 this transformation is exact for the @xmath34 hierarchical structure .    equation ( [ lgtr ] ) should be supplemented with the relation between conductivities and resistivities distribution functions ( df ) in the laplace representation .",
    "it may be easily derived from the definitions ( [ def1 ] ) , using the following integral identity : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the bessel s function . as a result",
    ", the relation between @xmath65 and @xmath66 takes the form of hankel s transformation : @xmath67 the reverse relation is of the same form .",
    "this transformation has the following properties to be used later : @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70    thus we have a closed set of equations for arbitrary rescaling factors @xmath55 and @xmath36 .",
    "it appears to be more convenient to deal with an infinitesimal transformation by setting @xmath71 , @xmath72 . from eq.([lgtr ] ) we have the variation of distribution functions consisting of longitudinal and transverse parts : @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",

    "( [ hankel ] ) , determines the evolution of the distribution function upon size scaling in a closed form .",
    "this scheme also allows us to treat the percolation system , introducing the probability that the @xmath79-sized cube is disconnected ( i.e. , has zero conductivity or infinite resistivity ) @xmath80 . taking into account the definitions of distribution functions ( [ def1 ] )",

    "now let us consider statistical properties of clusters for the percolation problem , i.e. , the distribution of clusters over sizes and site numbers , existence and capacity of the infinite cluster , etc .",
