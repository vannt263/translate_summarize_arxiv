    "the classification of superconductors as type - i and type - ii introduced within the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory near @xmath3 is based on the value of the gl parameter @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the weak field penetration depth and @xmath7 is the coherence length).@xcite a bulk material is of the type - ii if @xmath8 ; in fields @xmath9 vortices are nucleated.@xcite the lower critical field @xmath10 is related to the line energy of a single vortex , @xmath11 , which is found by solving the gl equations for the order parameter and supercurrents : @xmath12 .",
    "the mixed phase with vortices exists in fields up to @xmath13 such that @xmath14 , where the thermodynamic critical field is related to the condensation energy density @xmath15 . in the gl domain @xmath16 . if @xmath17 , the bulk material is in the meissner state in fields @xmath18 and is classified as type - i .",
    "the question of this classification for low temperatures in isotropic materials was addressed by eilenberger who evaluated the upper critical field @xmath19 along with @xmath20 to show that @xmath21 increases on cooling to @xmath22 by about 30% .",
    "@xcite hence , taking @xmath23 as governing material behavior in magnetic field , one concludes that if @xmath8 at @xmath3 , it certainly exceeds this value at all temperatures and , therefore , the gl classification should hold at any @xmath4 .",
    "it is worth noting that this classification holds for fermi spheres and constant order parameters ( s - wave ) .",
    "when strongly anisotropic materials came forth and in particular with discovery of cuprates , it was realized that a mere fact of anisotropy may cause @xmath1 to change with the field orientation.@xcite although for cuprates with @xmath24 the question of the superconductivity type never arose , it became clear that in principle an anisotropic material can be type - i for one field orientation and type - ii for another .",
    "the situation is even more complicated with multi - band materials and with other than s - wave order parameters for which the temperature and angular behavior of @xmath19 ( along with @xmath7 ) differs from that of @xmath6 , while both these quantities depend on the fermi surface and on the order parameter anisotropy .",
    "the general formalism for calculating @xmath19 and @xmath6 in the clean case has recently been developed for arbitrary fermi surfaces and order parameters.@xcite we argue , however , that minute details of the fermi surfaces are usually of little effect on @xmath19 and @xmath6 because the equations governing these quantities contain only integrals over the whole fermi surfaces . therefore , one can consider the simplest fermi shapes of spheroids ( for tetragonal materials ) for which the fermi surface averaging is a well defined procedure .",
    "hence , @xmath25 is now accessible for various anisotropies of fermi surfaces and order parameters .",
    "however , for anisotropic materials at arbitrary temperatures , the gl criterion based on the value of @xmath5 is questionable because the gl theory _",
    "per se _ only works near @xmath3 .",
    "we use in this text a different approach based on the fact that in type - ii superconductors the two characteristic fields , @xmath10 at which vortices nucleate in the bulk material , and @xmath19 , the maximum field at which the mixed state exists , satisfy @xmath26 .",
    "either part of this inequality , @xmath27 or @xmath28 ( or for this matter @xmath29 ) , can be used to classify the material behavior as that of type - ii . however , to have @xmath30 one should evaluate the vortex line energy within the microscopic theory , a difficult problem if at all doable . on the other hand ,",
    "both @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be evaluated for anisotropic fermi surfaces and order parameters at any temperature .",
    "it is the criterion @xmath33 that we study in this work .",
    "below we calculate the condensation energy for anisotropic situation at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "next , we review methods for evaluation of @xmath19 and @xmath6 and present numerical results to show that the criterion based on the ratio @xmath0 differs substantially from that employing @xmath1 .",
    "perhaps , the simplest formally for our purpose is the approach based on the eilenberger quasiclassical formalism that holds for a general anisotropic fermi surface and for any gap symmetry .",
    "@xcite the theory deals with two functions , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which are integrated over the energy gorkov green s functions . for a uniform state of clean superconductors of interest here",
    "satisfy : @xmath37 here , @xmath38 with an integer @xmath39 .",
    "we employ the approximation of a separable coupling responsible for superconductivity : @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the fermi momentum.@xcite in this approximation the order parameter @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 determines the @xmath41 dependence of @xmath44 and is normalized so that the average over the fermi surface @xmath45 .",
    "equations ( [ eil12 ] ) give : @xmath46 the order parameter should satisfy the self - consistency equation of the theory , see , e.g. , ref .",
    ": @xmath47 where @xmath48 stands for averaging over the fermi surface .",
    "equations ( [ eil12 ] ) and ( [ self - cons ] ) can be obtained as minimum conditions for the energy functional:@xcite",
    "@xmath49\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{functional}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the density of states per spin on the fermi level .",
    "substituting here the solutions ( [ f , g ] ) and taking into account the self - consistency relation ( [ self - cons ] ) one obtains the condensation energy density @xmath52 : @xmath53    at @xmath22 ( replace @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 ( recall the isotropic result @xmath56 ) . to find the value of @xmath57 one considers the first sum in eq.([self - cons ] ) as extended to @xmath58 , while the second is replaced with @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is the debye frequency for the phonon mechanism or a proper cutoff for others ) : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the euler constant .",
    "this gives : @xmath63 hence , we have @xmath64 .    near @xmath3 , eq.([self - cons ] )",
    "yields @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",

    "we consider only representative order parameters : s - wave ( @xmath77 ) , d - wave ( @xmath78 with @xmath79 being the azimuth of spherical coordinates with the polar axis along the @xmath80 crystal direction , and order parameters of the form @xmath81 with the polar angle @xmath82 . the latter were recently suggested as possibilities for at least some of the fe - based materials;@xcite the  equatorial \" node @xmath83 has also been observed in the arpes data on bafe@xmath84(as@xmath85p@xmath86)@xmath84 .",

    "each curve on the upper panel in fact is three coinciding curves for fermi sphere and prolate and oblate spheroids , @xmath87 and 5 .",
    "the lower panel is for the order parameter @xmath88 with the normalization @xmath89 evaluated separately for each fermi shape , see appendix a. ]    numerical results for the thermodynamic critical field @xmath20 in units of @xmath90 are shown in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "this normalization is chosen because for the s - wave order parameter on a sphere we have close to 1 value of @xmath91 ( the notation @xmath92 for the normalized @xmath20 is to avoid confusion with the @xmath80 direction ) . as is seen in fig.[f1 ] ,",
    "nodes suppress the condensation energy and @xmath20 . besides",
    ", we observe that while the shape of the fermi surface does not affect @xmath20 for s- and d - wave order parameters , the equatorial node clearly makes a difference .",
    "the theory of the orbital @xmath19 of clean superconductors has recently been developed by the authors for arbitrary anisotropies of fermi surfaces and order parameters.@xcite within this theory , @xmath93 along the @xmath80 axis of uniaxial crystals is found by solving an equation : @xmath94 here , @xmath95 are fermi velocities in the @xmath96 plane , @xmath97 is the fermi energy , the velocity @xmath98 for the isotropic case .",
    "hence , both @xmath99 depending on the fermi surface and @xmath100 describing the order parameter anisotropy , enter the equation for @xmath101 under the integral over the fermi surface .",
    "this is the reason why the simple spheroid with the shape fixed by a single parameter , the ratio of semi - axes , suffices to describe major features of quantities of interest here .",
    "the theory of ref .",
    "allows one to evaluate also the anisotropy parameter @xmath102 .",
    "given @xmath103 , one solves eq.([eq - hc ] ) in which @xmath99 is replaced with @xmath104 .    in general , eq.([eq - hc ] ) can be solved numerically , but if @xmath22 or @xmath105 , the solutions are exact : @xcite @xmath106 for the isotropic case with @xmath77 and @xmath107 , one reproduces the helfand - werthamer clean limit results.@xcite    after simple algebra we obtain : @xmath108 in the isotropic case near @xmath3 , @xmath109 with @xmath110 see refs . or ; this coincides with the isotropic limit of eq.([hc2/hc-1 ] ) .    as mentioned above , if the ratio @xmath111 , the material in question is of the type - ii , if @xmath112 it behaves as type - i . using eqs.([hc2/hc-0 ] ) and ( [ hc2/hc-1 ] ) we compare these ratios at @xmath22 and @xmath3 for the @xmath80 direction : @xmath113 it is worth noting that this ratio depends on the fermi surface shape and the order parameter symmetry , but not on other material characteristics .    as an example",
    "we take @xmath114 on a fermi sphere to obtain @xmath115 .",
    "we note again that for the same order parameter anisotropy , say , for @xmath116 , the normalization @xmath45 imposes different @xmath89 for different fermi surfaces , see appendix a and fig.[f7 ] .",
    "hence , the criteria for type - i or -ii behavior depend on the fermi surface shape and the order parameter symmetry .",
    "the inverse tensor of squared penetration depth for the general anisotropic clean case is : @xcite @xmath117 here @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath74 satisfies the self - consistency equation : @xmath120 where @xmath73 .",
    "the density of states @xmath51 , fermi velocities @xmath121 , and the order parameter anisotropy @xmath100 are the input parameters for evaluation of @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath51 is not needed if one is interested only in the anisotropy @xmath124 : @xmath125 it is easy to show that eq.([gam - lam ] ) gives:@xcite @xmath126    at first sight , @xmath127 should approach @xmath3 as a constant or at least as some power @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "this would mean that @xmath130 in a practically finite gl domain .",
    "this , however , is not the case . to see this",
    "we evaluate @xmath127 near @xmath3 where @xmath131 since @xmath132 .",
    "expanding eq.([gam - lam ] ) for @xmath127 in powers of @xmath133 we obtain the first correction : @xmath134 since @xmath135 , @xmath127 approaches @xmath3 with a non - zero slope for all order parameters except the s - wave with @xmath77 .",
    "we will see below that for general anisotropies the ratios @xmath0 and @xmath1 also attain their gl values only at @xmath3 approaching them with finite slopes.@xcite",
    "this well - studied case is worth recalling because already here one can see that the criterion based on the value of @xmath1 can not be applied at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "we obtain using eq.([r(0)/r(1 ) ] ) : @xmath136 the value originally obtained by eilenberger .",
    "@xcite we thus see that if at @xmath3 an isotropic material has @xmath137 at the boundary between type - i and type - ii , it is of the type - ii at @xmath22 . for the material to be of the type - i at all @xmath4 s , i.e. , to have @xmath138 at all temperature , one needs @xmath139 , or @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath141 at @xmath3 , the material should undergo the transition from type - i to type - ii at some temperature under @xmath3 .",
    "it is easy to see that at all temperatures @xmath142 the criterion based on the ratio @xmath143 differs from that based on @xmath5 . to this end",

    "the difference is not large , still it shows that even in the isotropic case the value of @xmath5 is not a correct criterion for the type of superconductivity at any temperature except @xmath3 . basically , this is because @xmath149 only at @xmath3 .",
    "and the lower curve is @xmath150 for the isotropic case . ]",
    "these arguments are supported by the numerical calculation at arbitrary temperatures shown in fig.[f2 ] , where the upper curve is the ratio @xmath151 for @xmath152 ; the lower curve is @xmath150 .",
    "a feature worth noting in this figure is that the two curves have _ finite _ and _ different _ slopes at @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "in fact there is no however small temperature interval in the immediate vicinity of @xmath3 in which the gl  @xmath23-criterion \" works , except @xmath3 itself .    this feature is related to the mentioned above accuracy of gl theory : the energy expansion within gl is accurate up to terms of the order @xmath153 with @xmath154 , the order parameter @xmath155 along with @xmath156 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , all @xmath157 .",
    "their ratios - within the gl theory - should be considered as constant . to get next corrections to these constants one has to overstep the accuracy of the gl theory , i.e. , to go to the microscopic theory which shows that these ratios approach @xmath3 with finite slopes .",
    "the situation for anisotropic materials is , of course , more involved . to begin",
    ", we recall the standard notation . introducing the geometric average @xmath158 and @xmath159 one obtains @xmath160 and @xmath161 ( for brevity we use the notation @xmath162 instead of @xmath122 for the square root of one of diagonal elements of the tensor @xmath163 ) . for the coherence lengths we have @xmath164 and @xmath165 , where @xmath166 and @xmath167 . in general , @xmath168 , but at @xmath3 the anisotropies of both @xmath6 and @xmath19",
    "are determined by the same  mass tensor \" so that @xmath169.@xcite different @xmath170 and @xmath171 demonstrate particularly well the common but misleading association of superconducting anisotropies with the effective mass tensor of the band theory .",
    "direct calculations of the thermodynamic critical field @xmath172 , either using the microscopic theory or the anisotropic gl equations , yield @xmath173 hence , we have : @xmath174 because @xmath175 at @xmath3 . using known @xmath162 and @xmath176",
    "we obtain skipping the algebra : @xmath177 it is easily verified that @xmath178 reduces @xmath179 of eq.([kapgl ] ) in the isotropic case .",
    "for the in - plane field we have : @xmath180 hence , for this field orientation , one should operate with parameter @xmath181 .",
    "this choice is also dictated by the surface energy of the s - n boundary , say , in @xmath182 plane in field along @xmath183 ; the screening currents flow along @xmath80 whereas the order parameter is changing along @xmath184 .",
