    "we say a logic @xmath3 has a decidable characterization inside a logic @xmath4 if the following decision problem is decidable : `` given as input a formula of the logic @xmath4 , decide if it is equivalent to some formula of the logic @xmath3 '' .",
    "we are interested in the case when the logic @xmath4 is mso on words or trees , and @xmath3 represents some fragment of @xmath4 .",
    "this type of problem has been successfully studied in the case when @xmath4 is mso on finite words . in other words @xmath4 , represents the class of regular word languages .",
    "arguably best known is the result of mcnaughton , papert and schtzenberger  @xcite , which says that the following two conditions on a regular word language @xmath5 are equivalent : a ) @xmath5 can be defined in first - order logic with order and label tests ; b ) the syntactic semigroup of @xmath5 does not contain a non - trivial group .",
    "since condition b ) can be effectively tested , the above theorem gives a decidable characterization of first - order logic .",
    "this result demonstrates the importance of this type of work : a decidable characterization not only gives a better understanding of the logic in question , but it often reveals unexpected connections with algebraic concepts . during several decades of research , decidable characterizations have been found for fragments of first - order logic with restricted quantification and various signatures ( typically subsets of the order relation and the successor relation ) , as well as a large group of temporal logics , see @xcite and @xcite for references .",
    "an important part of this research has been devoted to the quantifier alternation hierarchy , where each level counts the alterations between @xmath6 and @xmath7 quantifiers in a first - order formula in prenex normal form .",
    "the quantifier free part of such a formula is built using a binary predicate @xmath8 representing the linear order on the word .",
    "formulas that have @xmath9 alternations ( and therefore @xmath10 blocks of quantifiers ) are called @xmath11 if they begin with @xmath7 , and @xmath12 if they begin with  @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , the word property `` some position has label @xmath13 '' can be defined by a @xmath14 formula @xmath15 , while the language `` nonempty words with at most two positions that do not have label @xmath13 '' can be defined by the @xmath16 formula @xmath17    a lot of attention has been devoted to analyzing the low levels of the quantifier alternation hierarchy for word languages .",
    "the two lowest levels are easy : a word language is definable in @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) if and only if it is closed under inserting ( removing ) letters .",
    "both properties can be tested in polynomial time based on a recognizing automaton , or semigroup .",
    "however , just above @xmath19 , and even before we get to @xmath20 , we already find two important classes of languages .",
    "a fundamental result , due to simon  @xcite , says that a language is defined by a boolean combination of @xmath14 formulas if and only if its syntactic monoid is @xmath21-trivial . above the boolean combination of @xmath14 , we find @xmath22 , i.e.  languages that can be defined simultaneously in @xmath16 and @xmath23 .",
    "as we will describe later on , this class turns out to be surprisingly robust , and it is the focus of this paper .",
    "another fundamental result , due to pin and weil  @xcite , says that a regular language is in @xmath22 if and only if its syntactic monoid is in da .",
    "the limit of our knowledge is level @xmath16 : it is decidable if a language can be defined on level @xmath16  @xcite , but there are no known decidable characterization for boolean combinations of @xmath16 , for @xmath24 , for @xmath25 , and upwards .    for trees",
    "even less is known .",
    "no decidable characterization has been found for what is arguably the most important proper subclass of regular tree languages , first - order logic with the descendant relation , despite several attempts .",
    "similarly open are chain logic and the temporal logics ctl , ctl * and pdl .",
    "however , there has been some recent progress . in  @xcite ,",
    "decidable characterizations were presented for some temporal logics , while benedikt and segoufin  @xcite characterized tree languages definable in first - order logic with the successor relation ( but without the descendant relation ) .",
    "this paper is part of a program to understand the expressive power of first - order logic on trees , and the quantifier alternation hierarchy in particular .",
    "the idea is to try to understand the low levels of the quantifier alternation hierarchy before taking on full first - order logic ( which is contrary to the order in which word languages were analyzed ) .",
    "we focus on two signatures .",
    "the first signature contains unary predicates for label tests and the ancestor order on nodes , denoted @xmath8 .",
    "the second signature assumes that the trees have an order on siblings , which induces a lexicographical linear order on nodes , denoted @xmath26 .",
    "both signatures generalize the linear order on words .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , there is a reasonable notion of concatenation hierarchy for tree languages that corresponds to the quantifier alternation hierarchy .",
    "levels @xmath14 and @xmath18 are as simple for trees as they are for words .",
    "a recent result  @xcite extends simon s theorem to trees , by giving a decidable characterization of tree languages definable by a boolean combination of @xmath14 formulas , and also a decidable characterization of boolean combinations of @xmath27 formulas .",
    "there is no known decidable characterization of tree languages definable in @xmath11 for @xmath28 .",
    "the contribution of this paper is a decidable characterization of tree languages definable in @xmath22 , i.e.  definable both in @xmath16and @xmath23 .",
    "we also provide a decidable characterization of tree languages definable in @xmath29 .",
    "as we signaled above , for word languages the class @xmath22 is well studied and important , with numerous equivalent characterizations . among them",
    "one can find  @xcite : a ) word languages that can be defined in the temporal logic with operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; b ) word languages that can be defined by a first - order formula with two variables , but with unlimited quantifier alternations ; c ) word languages whose syntactic semigroup belongs to the semigroup variety da ; d ) word languages recognized by two - way ordered deterministic automata ; e ) a certain form of `` unambiguous '' regular expressions .",
    "it is not clear how to extend some of these concepts to trees .",
    "even when natural tree counterparts exist , they are not equivalent . for instance",
    ", the temporal logic in a ) can be defined for trees  by using operators `` in some descendant '' and `` in some ancestor '' .",
    "this temporal logic was studied in  @xcite , however it was shown to have an expressive power incomparable with that of @xmath22 .",
    "a characterization of @xmath22was left as an open problem , one which is solved here .",
    "we provide an algebraic characterization of tree languages definable in @xmath22and in @xmath29 .",
    "this characterization is effectively verifiable if the language is given by a tree automaton .",
    "it is easy to see that the word setting can be treated as a special case of the tree setting .",
    "hence our characterization builds on the one over words .",
    "however the added complexity of the tree setting makes both formulating the correct condition and generalizing the proof quite nontrivial .",
    "in this section , we present some basic definitions regarding trees . we also present the formalism of forest algebra , which is used in our characterizations .",
    "in this paper we work with finite , unranked , ordered trees and forests over a finite alphabet @xmath32 formally , these are expressions defined inductively as follows : if @xmath33 is a forest and @xmath34 then @xmath35 is a tree .",
    "if @xmath36 is a finite sequence of trees , then @xmath37 is a forest .",
    "this applies as well to the empty sequence of trees , which is called the _",
    "empty forest , _ and denoted 0 ( and which provides a place for the induction to start ) .",
    "forests and trees alike will be denoted by the letters @xmath38 when necessary , we will remark which forests are trees , i.e.  contain only one tree in the sequence .",
    "the notion of node , as well as the descendant and ancestor relations are defined in the usual way .",
    "we write @xmath39 to say that @xmath40 is a strict ancestor of @xmath41 or , equivalently , that @xmath41 is a strict descendant of @xmath40 . as usual , we write @xmath42 when @xmath43 or @xmath39 .",
    "the parent of a node @xmath40 is its immediate ancestor .",
    "two nodes @xmath40 and @xmath41 are _ siblings _ if they have the same parent .",
    "we also use the lexicographic order on nodes , written @xmath26 . recall that @xmath44 holds if either @xmath39 , or there are nodes @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that @xmath47 is a sibling to the left of @xmath48 .",
    "if we take a forest and replace one of the leaves by a special symbol @xmath49 , we obtain a _ context .",
    "_ contexts will be denoted using letters @xmath50 .",
    "a forest @xmath33 can be substituted in place of the hole of a context @xmath51 , the resulting forest is denoted by @xmath52 .",
    "there is a natural composition operation on contexts : the context @xmath53 is formed by replacing the hole of @xmath54 with @xmath51 .",
    "this operation is associative , and satisfies @xmath55 for all forests @xmath33 and contexts @xmath51 and @xmath54 .",
    "we say a forest @xmath33 is an _ immediate piece _ of a forest @xmath56 if @xmath57 can be decomposed as @xmath58 and @xmath59 for some context @xmath51 , some label @xmath13 , and some forest @xmath60 .",
    "the reflexive transitive closure of the immediate piece relation is called the _ piece _ relation .",
    "we write @xmath61 to say that @xmath33 is a piece of @xmath60 . in other words ,",
    "a piece of @xmath60 is obtained by removing nodes from @xmath60 .",
    "we extend the notion of piece to contexts . in this case",
    ", the hole must be preserved while removing the nodes .",
    "the notions of piece for forests and contexts are related , of course .",
    "for instance , if @xmath51 , @xmath54 are contexts with @xmath62 , then @xmath63 . also , conversely , if @xmath61 , then there are contexts @xmath62 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "( for instance , one can take @xmath66 and @xmath67 . ) the picture below depicts two contexts , the left one being a piece of the right one , as can be seen by removing the white nodes .",
    "we will be considering three types of languages in the paper : _ forest languages _",
    "i.e.  sets of forests , denoted @xmath5 ; _ context languages _ , i.e.  sets of contexts , denoted @xmath68 , and _ tree languages _ , i.e.  sets of trees , denoted @xmath69 .",
    "note that a forest language can contain trees .",
    "_ forest algebras _ were introduced by bojaczyk and walukiewicz as an algebraic formalism for studying regular tree languages  @xcite . here",
    "we give a brief summary of the definition of these algebras and their important properties . a forest algebra consists of a pair @xmath70 of finite monoids , subject to some additional requirements , which we describe below .",
    "we write the operation in @xmath71 multiplicatively and the operation in @xmath72 additively , although @xmath72 is not assumed to be commutative .",
    "we accordingly denote the identity of @xmath71 by @xmath49 and that of @xmath72 by 0 .",
    "we require that @xmath71 act on the left of @xmath72 .",
    "that is , there is a map @xmath73",
    "such that @xmath74 for all @xmath75 and @xmath76 we further require that this action be _ monoidal , _ that is , @xmath77 for all @xmath78 and that it be _ faithful , _ that is , if @xmath79 for all @xmath78 then @xmath80 finally we require that for every @xmath81 @xmath71 contains elements @xmath82 and @xmath83 defined by @xmath84 for all @xmath85    a morphism @xmath86 of forest algebras is actually a pair @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a monoid morphism between @xmath89 and @xmath90 and @xmath91 is a monoid morphism between @xmath92 and @xmath93 , such that @xmath94 for all @xmath78 @xmath95 however , we will abuse notation slightly and denote both component maps by @xmath96    let @xmath97 be a finite alphabet , and let us denote by @xmath98 the set of forests over @xmath99 and by @xmath100 the set of contexts over @xmath32 each of these is a monoid , with the operations being forest concatenation and context composition , respectively . the pair @xmath101 , with forest substitution as action , forms a forest algebra , which we denote @xmath102    we say that a forest algebra @xmath70 _ recognizes _ a forest language @xmath103 if there is a morphism @xmath104 and a subset @xmath105 of @xmath72 such that @xmath106 a forest language is regular , i.e.  recognized by any of the many equivalent notions of automata for unranked trees that can be found in the literature , if and only if it is recognized by a finite forest algebra  @xcite .",

    "we want an algorithm deciding whether a given regular forest language is definable in @xmath29and another one for deciding whether it is in @xmath22 .",
    "as noted earlier , the corresponding problem for words was solved by pin and weil  @xcite : a word language @xmath5 is definable in @xmath22if and only if its syntactic monoid @xmath148 belongs to the variety da , i.e.  it satisfies the identity @xmath149 for all @xmath150 .",

    "we assume that the language @xmath5 is given by its syntactic monoid and syntactic morphism , or by some other representation , such as a finite automaton , from which these can be effectively computed .",

    "hence , we can use the assumption on @xmath571 to infer @xmath572 in a similar way , we use @xmath559 , the assumption  ( [ eq : assumption - left ] ) , and @xmath573 , to complete the proof of this case , and of lemma  [ lemma : y - approx ] .",
    "in this section , we consider the logic @xmath22where only the descendant order , and not the lexicographic order , is available . we give an effective characterization in the following theorem .",

    "horizontal commutativity must also hold : the logic only has the descendant relation , and therefore its formulas are invariant under rearranging sibling subtrees .",
    "the `` if '' implication is a minor variation on the work done in the previous sections . recall that we proved before that if the syntactic forest algebra of a language @xmath5 satisfies the @xmath0 identity , then both @xmath5 and its complement can be defined by @xmath142 forest expressions .",
    "we apply this result also in our case .",

    "the commutative closure of a @xmath142 forest expression is definable in @xmath16 .",
    "before we prove this proposition , we remark that this is not a completely generic result .",

    "however , this language can not be defined in @xmath25 .",
    "actually , an ehrenfeucht - fraiss argument shows that every first - order formula , that has quantifier depth @xmath10 and only uses the descendant order , will give the same result for all balanced binary trees of depths larger than @xmath577 .",
    "the proof of the above proposition is by induction on the size of the @xmath142 forest expression .",
    "the base case is when the @xmath142 expression is either @xmath578 , or a language that is closed under pieces . in the first case ,",
    "the language is clearly definable in @xmath16 . in the second case",
    ", we revisit the proof of lemma  [ lem : pi1-lemma ] , which showed that a language @xmath5 that is closed under pieces is definable in @xmath158 .",
    "if we take the commutative closure of @xmath5 , we get a commutative language closed under pieces . in the proof of lemma  [ lem : pi1-lemma ]",
    ", we constructed the @xmath158 formula by forbidding a finite number of pieces ; in the commutative case the formula does not need to worry about the order of siblings in the forbidden pieces .    in the induction step",
    ", we have to consider the operations that are allowed by @xmath142 expressions : union , intersection , ( horizontal ) concatenation @xmath579 and ( vertical ) composition @xmath580 for a forest languages @xmath164 and context languages @xmath163 .",
    "union and intersection are easy .",
    "concatenation and composition are more problematic .",

    "the languages @xmath582 are both definable in @xmath581 , but their concatenation @xmath583 is not , since it does not contain the forest @xmath584",
    ".    nevertheless , if we use commutative closure , the problem disappears .",
    "that is , we will show that if the languages @xmath585 are definable in @xmath16 , then the commutative closure of each of the languages in  ( [ eq : concat ] ) and  ( [ eq : compos ] ) can be defined in @xmath16 .",
    "we only do the cases @xmath586 and @xmath189 , the language @xmath191 is done the same way .",
    "[ oplus - forests ] if forest languages @xmath164 are definable in @xmath16 , then so is the commutative closure of @xmath586 .    we write @xmath587 for the commutative closure of @xmath190",

    "for the general case , we use the following lemma on forest languages definable in @xmath581 .    [",

    "the statement of the lemma immediately follows from the following claim on formulas of @xmath581 .",
    "we claim that any formula @xmath177 of @xmath581 is equivalent to a finite disjunction of formulas of the form @xmath592 where @xmath593 , and @xmath594 are formulas such that    1 .",

    "2 .   the formula @xmath202 has all quantification relativized to nodes that are not descendants of any of the nodes @xmath597 .",
    "the idea , of course , is that the @xmath596 describe the roots of the trees that contain the existentially quantified nodes @xmath598 in the original formula @xmath177 of @xmath581 .",
    "the straightforward proof of the claim is omitted .",
    "the finite disjunction ranges over all possible repartitions of the nodes @xmath598 into distinct trees .    from this normal form ,",
    "since @xmath599 distributes across union , it suffices to give a @xmath16formula for languages of the form @xmath600 where the @xmath69 languages are tree languages definable in @xmath16and where @xmath601 are forest languages definable in @xmath18 . by the technique shown at the beginning of the proof , it is sufficient to obtain a formula for @xmath602 .",
    "but the language @xmath602 is closed under pieces , and therefore it is definable in @xmath18 .    if context languages @xmath163 are definable in @xmath16 , then so is the commutative closure of @xmath603 .    we write @xmath604 for the commutative closure of @xmath189 .",
    "consider first the case when either @xmath68 or @xmath605 is a language @xmath578 .",
    "the formula places a variable on node corresponding to @xmath606 , and relativizes the formula for the remaining context language to the remaining nodes .",

    ". let @xmath614 be the @xmath16formula defining @xmath615 obtained in the same way .",
    "both of these formulas have a free variable , which describes the hole of the context . using lemma  [ oplus - forests ]",
    "we also have a @xmath16formula @xmath616 defining @xmath587 .",
    "the desired @xmath16formula puts an existentially quantified variable @xmath40 on the node corresponding to @xmath471 , another existentially quantified variable @xmath47 on the node corresponding to @xmath617 , and then runs three subformulas , for @xmath608 , @xmath618 , and @xmath619 , on the remaining nodes , appropriately relativizing the quantification . more specifically , this is the formula @xmath620 where @xmath621 is the @xmath158 formula stating that @xmath40 is a proper ancestor of @xmath47 and there are no nodes in between , @xmath622 is constructed from @xmath612 by relativizing all quantification to the ancestors of @xmath40 , @xmath623 is constructed from @xmath614 by relativizing all quantification to the descendants of @xmath40 , and @xmath624 is constructed from @xmath616 by relativizing all quantification to the nodes that are neither ancestor of @xmath40 nor descendant of @xmath47 .",
