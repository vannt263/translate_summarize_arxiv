    "evolution of a supernova remnant ( snr ) with no neutron star in its center is described essentially by the shock waves propagating outward ( blast wave ) into the ambient matter and inward ( reverse - shock wave ) into the supernova ejecta . in young snrs ,",
    "the shocked matter is heated up to temperatures higher than @xmath0  k and forms an optically - thin hot plasma .",
    "this plasma emits x - rays with many emission lines of highly - ionized heavy elements .",
    "since the time - scale of ionization by electron impact is longer than that of shock - heating of electrons , x - ray spectra of young snrs exhibit ionization states lower than those expected from the electron temperatures , which is called under - ionized or ionizing . the ionization state is represented by ionization temperature @xmath1 , the plasma temperature in collisional ionization equilibrium having the relevant ionization state .",
    "thus , many of young snrs show @xmath2 ( under - ionized / ionizing ) for the electron temperature @xmath3 .    on the contrary to the above standard scenario , @xcite found an over - ionized plasma ( @xmath4 ) in the _ asca _ observation from a mixed - morphology snr , ic443 .",
    "they proposed that thermal conduction from the hot interior of the remnant to the cold exterior can explain the over - ionized plasma .",
    "@xcite further investigated other five mixed - morphology snrs , w49b , w28 , w44 , 3c 391 and kes 27 , and found that w49b shows @xmath4 as well .",
    "_ suzaku _ detected clear spectral structures of radiative - recombination continua , direct evidence for recombining plasmas , in the x - ray spectra of ic443 @xcite and w49b @xcite .",
    "radiative recombination continua , and hence an over - ionized plasma is also found in another mixed - morphology snr , g359.10.5 @xcite .",
    "although the samples are still limited , the over - ionized plasmas are all found in the mixed - morphology snrs associated in or near the star - forming complex with hii regions and molecular clouds .",
    "hence these snrs are likely due to core - collapse supernovae ; the over - ionized plasma is possibly related to the massive progenitor and/or its environments .",
    "one possibility is that the ionization by photons of a few tens kev at the initial phase of explosion of massive stars , e.g. , possible x - ray flash or afterglow of @xmath5-ray bursts , is responsible for the over - ionized state .",
    "another possibility is rarefaction in the adiabatic evolution phase of the snr ; when the shock wave breaks out of the dense circumstellar matter ( csm ) , like the progenitor s stellar wind , into the rarefied interstellar medium ( ism ) , the shock - heated electrons would rapidly cool due to adiabatic expansion , leaving highly ionized states @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the latter possibility .",
    "@xcite calculated snr evolution and radiation for a spherically symmetric structure .",
    "we extend this work to non - symmetric structures as are found in mixed - morphology snrs .",
    "unlike @xcite , we do not take ionization or radiation processes into account ; we assume the relevant snr evolution is fully adiabatic .",
    "we describe the model in the following section , calculation and results in section 3 , and discuss the results in section 4 .",
    "we give a summary in section 5 and notes about electron temperature in appendix .",
    "in a core - collapse supernova , the massive progenitor ( red or blue supergiant or wolf - rayet star ) is expected to blow a strong stellar wind in its pre - supernova phase and forms dense csm around the progenitor . if the stellar wind is spherically symmetric with a mass - loss rate @xmath6 and wind velocity @xmath7 , the csm density @xmath8 at a distance @xmath9 from the progenitor is given by    @xmath10    for a while before supernova explosion , the stellar wind ceases . then the stellar wind forms a thick shell .",
    "the inner and outer radii of the shell are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) , where time @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the duration of the wind activity and the elapsed time after the cease of the wind , respectively .    in realistic stellar winds , more matter around the equatorial plane than the polar direction may be accumulated , because of the rotation of the progenitor ; disk - like winds of be stars for an extreme example .",
    "we thus modify eq .",

    "hereafter , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are referred to the radii on the equatorial plane .",
    "this distribution gives @xmath20 times higher density on the equatorial plane than in the polar direction at the same distance .",
    "for the progenitor of sn  1987a , @xcite suggested that the ratio of equatorial to polar mass - loss rate was at least 20 during its red supergiant stage .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath21 . in our calculations",

    "we calculate the evolution for the following five models :    * isotropic csm same as @xcite for a reference . * anisotropic csm concentrated around the equatorial plane . * same as a2 , but more mass around the equatorial plane . * same as a2 , but with a lower density ism .",

    "<S> we carry out 3d - hydrodynamical calculations for the interaction of expanding supernova ejecta with the dense circumstellar matter ( csm ) and the rarefied interstellar medium ( ism ) outside . </S>",
    "<S> the csm is composed of the stellar wind matter from the progenitor in its pre - supernova phase , and assumed to be axially symmetric : more matter around the equator than in the polar direction driven by rotation of the progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> because of high density of the csm , the ionization state of the shock - heated ejecta quickly becomes equilibrium with the electron temperature . </S>",
    "<S> when the blast wave breaks out of the csm into the rarefied ism , the shocked ejecta cools rapidly due to adiabatic expansion , and hence an over - ionized / recombining plasma would be left . </S>",
    "<S> the ejecta is reheated by the second reverse shock due to the interaction with the ism . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the emission measure of the supernova remnant ( snr ) along the line of sight , and find that the over - ionized plasma appears to be bar - like with wings in the edge - on ( equatorial view ) , while shell - like in the face - on ( polar view ) geometry with respect to the rotation axis . </S>",
    "<S> the hot gas heated by the blast wave exists in the outermost region of the snr with a nearly complete shell , but the x - rays therefrom are too faint to be observable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , depending on the viewing angle , the snr of the over - ionized plasma would exhibit center - filled morphology in x - rays , like w49b , a mixed - morphology snr . </S>",
    "<S> the bar - like structure is swept out by the second reverse shock and disappears eventually , and then the snr becomes shell - like in both the equatorial and polar views in the later phase of the evolution . </S>"
