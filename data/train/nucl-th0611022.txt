    "in the first part of this work  @xcite we have extended the theoretical framework of relativistic self - consistent mean - field models to include correlations related to the restoration of broken symmetries and to fluctuations of collective coordinates . in the specific model which has been developed in  @xcite ,",

    "the intrinsic wave functions are generated from the solutions of the constrained relativistic mean - field + bcs equations in an axially deformed oscillator basis . in order to test the implementation of the gcm and angular momentum projection , a number of illustrative calculations were performed for the nuclei @xmath4hg and @xmath2 mg , in comparison with results obtained in non - relativistic models based on skyrme and gogny effective interactions .    in this work",
    "we develop the model further by including the restoration of particle number in the wave functions of gcm states , i.e. we restore a symmetry which is broken on the mean - field level by the treatment of pairing correlations either in the bcs approximation , or in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) framework .",
    "we perform a gcm configuration mixing of angular - momentum and particle - number projected relativistic wave functions .",
    "projection on particle number is crucial whenever the number of correlated pairs becomes small and the density of levels close to the fermi energy is low , a situation typical for the description of phenomena related to the evolution of shell structure @xcite : reduction of spherical shell gaps and modifications of magic numbers in nuclei far from stability , occurrence of islands of inversion and coexistence of shapes with different deformations , moments of inertia of superdeformed bands , etc .",
    "we thus plan to build a self - consistent relativistic mean - field model in which rotational symmetry and particle - number are restored , and fluctuations of the quadrupole deformation are explicitly taken into account .",
    "such a model can be applied in a quantitative description of shell evolution , and particularly in the treatment of shape coexistence phenomena in nuclei with soft potential energy surfaces .    in sec .",
    "[ secii ] we outline the relativistic point - coupling model and the lipkin - nogami approximate particle number projection , which are used to generate the intrinsic mean - field wave functions with axial symmetry , and introduce the formalism of configuration mixing of angular - momentum and particle - number projected wave functions . in sec .",

    ", the inclusion of dynamical pairing effects reduces the moment of inertia , but the resulting spectrum is much too spread out compared to experiment .",

    "it has been shown that in the latter case rotational bands with larger moments of inertia are obtained @xcite , provided that the model geometry allows for the alignment of nucleon angular momenta .",
    "since the full projection before variation is technically and computationally much more complex , it has been seldom used in realistic calculations .",
    "we note that one possible improvement of the present model would be to project , for each value of the angular momentum @xmath83 , the cranked mean - field wave functions which , in addition to the mass quadrupole moment , are also constrained to have @xmath132  @xcite .",

    "we note that in the bcs approximation pairing correlations vanish both in the nd and sd minimum , and this means that the restoration of particle number can produce sizable effects in the ground - state and sd bands .",

    "the theoretical results are in qualitative agreement .",

    "[ tabd ] the amp gcm excitation energies and the b(e2 , j @xmath148 j-2 ) values for the nd band , are shown in comparison with those calculated with the gogny d1s interaction in ref .",
    "the results obtained with the pc - f1 and gogny effective interactions are very similar , and a considerable increase of the moment of inertia as compared to the pn&amp gcm spectra , is caused by the collapse of pairing correlations in the nd minimum .    in the left panel of fig .",

    "being restricted to axially symmetric shapes , the model that we have developed in this work can not take these effects into account .",
    "this is clearly reflected in the pronounced discrepancy between the calculated and experimental b(e2 ) values .",
    "similar results have also been obtained with the sly6 ( see tab .",

    "do not crucially depend on the effective interaction in the particle - hole channel . on the other hand ,",
    "the predicted positions of the sd band - head differ significantly : for the gogny d1s interaction the band - head is at @xmath175 mev , whereas the sly6 interaction predicts a lower value of @xmath176 mev .",
    "the positions of sd band - head obtained in the pn&amp and amp gcm calculations with the pc - f1 interaction are @xmath177 mev and @xmath178 mev , respectively .",
    "finally , the amplitudes of the collective pn&amp gcm wave functions @xmath135 for the nd ( @xmath136 , @xmath127 , @xmath138 and @xmath179 ) , and the sd ( @xmath180 , @xmath146 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 and @xmath183 ) rotational bands in @xmath3ar are plotted in fig .",
    "we notice that , except for the ground state @xmath136 , the amplitudes of the states of the nd band are principally concentrated in the oblate minimum , whereas in the panel on the right the amplitudes of the wave functions are strongly peaked in the prolate superdeformed minimum .",
    "in ref .  @xcite and in this work we have extended the very successful relativistic mean - field theory @xcite to explicitly include correlations related to the restoration of broken symmetries and to fluctuations of collective coordinates .",
    "we have developed a model that uses the generator coordinate method to perform configuration mixing of angular - momentum and particle - number projected relativistic wave functions .",
    "the geometry is restricted to axially symmetric shapes , and the intrinsic wave functions are generated from the solutions of the relativistic mean - field + lipkin - nogami bcs equations , with a constraint on the mass quadrupole moment .",
    "the single - nucleon dirac eigenvalue equation is solved by expanding the large and small components of the nucleon spinor in terms of eigenfunctions of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the current implementation of the model employs a relativistic point - coupling ( contact ) nucleon - nucleon effective interaction in the particle - hole channel , and a density - independent @xmath0-interaction in the particle - particle channel .",
    "we have performed several illustrative calculations which test our implementation of the gcm with simultaneous particle - number and angular - momentum projection .",
    "the results have been compared with those obtained employing the relativistic gcm model developed in the first part of this work @xcite , which does not include particle - number projection , but only conserves the number of particles on the average , and with results that were obtained using the corresponding non - relativistic models based on skyrme and gogny effective interactions . in this work the low - lying spectra of @xmath1 mg , @xmath2s and @xmath3ar",
    "have been analyzed .",
    "the results of gcm configuration mixing calculations both without and with particle - number projection , have been compared with those obtained with the angular - momentum projected gcm based on the gogny d1s effective interaction , and with the particle - number and angular - momentum projected gcm based on the skyrme sly4 and sly6 effective interactions .",
    "the principal features of the spectra calculated without ( gogny interaction ) and with particle - number projection ( skyrme forces ) , are very well reproduced in our gcm calculation with the pc - f1 relativistic effective interaction .",
    "these include the deformations and moments of inertia of yrast bands , and the occurrence and structure of superdeformed bands . some differences between the predictions of the three models , as for instance the position of the head @xmath147 of the superdeformed band , can be attributed to the gaps in the mean - field single - nucleon spectra calculated with the different effective interactions .",
    "we have also shown that dynamical pairing effects play an important role in the description of the low - energy spectra .",
    "in particular , we find a pronounced effect of particle - number projection on the moments of inertia of the ground - state and superdeformed rotational bands .",
    "another example is the two - phonon triplet @xmath130 , @xmath146 and @xmath138 in @xmath2s , which can be reproduced by gcm calculations only when dynamical pairing effects are taken into account .",
    "there are , of course , many possible improvements and extensions of the present implementation of the relativistic gcm model .",
    "perhaps the most obvious is the extension to shapes that are not constrained by axial symmetry .",
    "the inclusion of triaxial deformations is in principle straightforward but , because it requires an enormous increase of computational capabilities , not feasible at present .",
    "the second major problem is that our gcm configuration mixing calculations correspond to a projection after variation .",
    "a more general variation after projection is far too complicated to be used in realistic calculations at the present stage .",
    "a possible improvement , however , is to generate the gcm basis functions , for each value of the angular momentum , by performing cranking rmf+lnbcs calculations with the additional constraint @xmath184 .",
    "this would automatically increase the moments of inertia of rotational bands , and therefore produce spectra in better agreement with experiment .",
    "the extension to odd - a nuclei necessitates the breaking of time - reversal invariance in the wave functions and , therefore , the explicit inclusion of currents in the energy - density functional , and the corresponding time - odd fields in the single - nucleon dirac equation .",
    "finally , let us emphasize again one the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely that those correlations which are explicitly treated in the gcm configuration mixing , should not be contained in the effective interaction in an implicit way , i.e. by adjusting the parameters of the interaction to data which already include these correlations .",
    "therefore , before the present version of the relativistic self - consistent gcm is applied in realistic calculations , we need to adjust a new global effective interaction which will not contain symmetry breaking corrections and quadrupole fluctuation correlations .",
    "the variation of the auxiliary functional @xmath186 eq .",
