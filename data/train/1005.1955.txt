    "as a complement to observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , an independent measurement of the hubble constant , @xmath0 , within 3% rms would place a valuable constraint on the dark energy equation - of - state parameter , @xmath7 ( e.g. hu 2005 , olling 2007 ) .",
    "the most widely accepted value for @xmath0 is 72 @xmath1 7 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ( freedman et al . 2001 ) , based on the `` extragalactic distance ladder '' and using the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) to calibrate cepheid variables which are treated as standard candles .",

    "if measured at the @xmath8 3% level , a value of @xmath0 = 72 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 would be consistent with the cosmological constant as an explanation of dark energy ( @xmath7 = -1 ) , whereas @xmath0 = 62 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 would challenge that model ( e.g. figure 14 of riess et al . , 2009 ) .",

    "are able to reduce the systematic uncertainty in @xmath0 compared to the lmc - based results because the cepheids in ngc 4258 are more similar in metallicity and period to those in the galaxies being calibrated .",
    "ngc 4258 is a good foundation for the extragalactic distance scale because its distance ( 7.2 mpc @xmath1 7% ) is known to high accuracy from observations of circumnuclear water megamasers in its agn accretion disk ( herrnstein et al .",
    "ngc 4258 is too close , though , for determining @xmath0 directly because its recession velocity may be highly influenced by its peculiar motion .",
    "lo ( 2005 ) gives a review of megamasers , including a discussion of the maser distance technique used in ngc 4258 .",
    "the megamaser cosmology project ( mcp ) aims to determine @xmath0 by measuring angular - diameter distances to galaxies in the hubble flow , @xmath9 50  200 mpc distant , using the maser technique .",
    "being independent of cepheids and the cmb , the mcp will provide a valuable check of these other methods for measuring @xmath0 .",
    "the project is a multi - year effort that begins with surveys for new megamaser disks .",
    "measuring a distance to each galaxy detected with a megamaser disk requires high - fidelity vlbi imaging , which we pursue with the high sensitivity array ( vlba+gbt+vla+effelsberg ) , and spectral - line monitoring to measure the centripetal accelerations of individual lines in the maser spectrum .",
    "the mcp aims to measure maser distances with @xmath9 10% or better accuracy to each of about 10 galaxies , thereby determining h@xmath10 to @xmath9 3% .    in a survey with the green bank telescope , braatz & gugliucci ( 2008 ; hereafter bg08 ) discovered water maser emission from the seyfert 2 galaxy ugc 3789 .",
    "the maser spectrum has three sets of doppler components spaced nearly symmetrically at and around the galaxy s systemic recession velocity ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this profile is characteristic of megamasers in an edge - on accretion disk .",
    "the megamaser in ugc 3789 is similar to that in ngc  4258 , where `` high - velocity '' blue - shifted and red - shifted maser components arise from the tangent points of the disk rotating toward and away from the observer , and components near the systemic recession velocity originate on the near side of the disk , along the line of sight to the central black hole .",
    "rotation velocities indicated by the high - velocity maser lines in ugc 3789 are @xmath9 400800 km s@xmath2 . by monitoring the maser spectrum roughly monthly over 6 months ,",
    "bg08 measured secular , redward drifts in radial velocity of 2  8 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2 among the systemic group of maser components , while the red- and blue - shifted features remained relatively fixed in velocity .",
    "the radial velocity drift is interpreted as centripetal acceleration in the maser gas as it orbits the central supermassive black hole . the spectral profile and",
    "the measured velocity drifts demonstrate that the maser disk in ugc 3789 is suitable for measuring an angular - diameter distance to the galaxy , using the method pioneered by herrnstein et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    in paper i from the megamaser cosmology project ( reid et al .",
    "2009 ) , we presented a vlbi image of the maser disk in ugc 3789 .",
    "the masers reveal nuclear gas in an edge - on disk ranging in radii from 0.08 to 0.30 pc .",
    "the high - velocity lines trace a keplerian rotation curve with high precision .",
    "while the high - velocity lines indicate relatively little disk warping , the systemic features show some structure that suggests the front side of the disk may be warped , tilted , or geometrically thick .    here",
    "we present single - dish observations of the ugc 3789 maser made with the green bank telescope over a period of 3.2 years . using these observations we refine the acceleration measurements made by bg08 and we present a model to estimate the distance to ugc 3789 using the maser observations .",
    "between 2006 january 12 and 2009 march 31 , we observed the 22 ghz water maser emission from ugc 3789 using the green bank telescope ( gbt ) of the national radio astronomy observatory .",
    "we observed the source 36 times during this period , with the observations spaced roughly monthly throughout , except for the summer months when the humidity makes observations at 22 ghz inefficient .",
    "table 1 shows the observing date and sensitivity for each observation .",
    "the first nine epochs are the same as reported in bg08 .",
    "we configured the spectrometer with two 200 mhz spectral windows , each with 8192 channels , giving a channel spacing of 24 khz , corresponding to 0.33 km s@xmath2 at 22 ghz .",
    "the first spectral window was centered on the systemic recession velocity of the galaxy , and the second was offset by 180 mhz to the red , giving a total bandwidth coverage of 380 mhz ( 5100 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "we observed both circular polarizations simultaneously using a total - power nodding mode in which the galaxy was placed alternately in one of the two beams of the 18  22 ghz k - band receiver , observing for 2.5 minutes at each position and then repeating the cycle .",
    "we reduced and analyzed the data using gbtidl . in order to enhance weak signals , we smoothed the blank sky reference spectra using a 16-channel boxcar function prior to calibration .",
    "we corrected the spectra for atmospheric attenuation using opacities derived from weather data , and applied an elevation - dependent gain curve .",
    "our flux density scale is uncertain by about 15% , limited by noise - tube calibration and pointing errors . to remove residual baseline shapes from each 200 mhz spectrum , we subtracted a polynomial ( typically third order ) fit to the line - free channels of the calibrated spectrum . finally , we hanning smoothed the spectra .",
    "integration times were typically about 2 hours for each epoch prior to may 2007 , and about 4 hours after .    unless stated otherwise , velocities quoted in this paper use the optical convention ( v@xmath11 = c@xmath12 ) and are given in the frame of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) . for ugc 3789",
    ", the lsr frame relates to the heliocentric frame by @xmath13 - 0.3 km s@xmath2 .",
    "in figure 2 we plot the radial velocities of ugc 3789 maser peaks as a function of the epoch observed .",
    "the local maxima in the maser profiles were determined by eye and are accurate to about one channel width ( 0.3 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the trends are evident : high - velocity spectral lines are roughly invariant in velocity throughout the monitoring period , while the radial velocities of the systemic features show a clear drift redward .",
    "the maser spectral lines in the systemic range remain within a window of velocities such that new lines may appear near the low velocity limit and disappear beyond the high velocity limit .",
    "some lines can be tracked throughout the entire monitoring period , while others appear or disappear over the course of the monitoring .",
    "if sufficiently long - lived , it would take individual maser spectral components at least 10 years , and in some cases much longer , to drift through the entire velocity window .",
    "the drift pattern evident in figure 2 is consistent with the picture of high - velocity maser emission originating near the midline of the edge - on megamaser disk , and maser emission near the systemic velocity originating on the near side of the disk .",
    "here we define the midline as the diameter of the disk perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "maser features along the line of sight to the central black hole but on the far side of the disk would show a drift to lower velocities , but there is no evidence in our data for such blueward drifts in ugc 3789 . the absence of detected masers from the far side of the disk may be understood if systemic masers amplify radio continuum emission originating interior to the maser disk . in that case",
    "masers on the far side of the disk would be beamed away from us .",
    "alternatively , maser emission from the far side of the disk might be free - free absorbed near the central black hole .    to measure accelerations for each of the maser lines in ugc 3789",
    ", we applied a global , nonlinear , least - squares @xmath14 minimization routine that decomposes the spectra into multiple gaussians at each epoch and solves simultaneously for the amplitude , width , velocity , and constant drift ( acceleration ) for each maser component .",
    "the method is described by humphreys et al .",
    "we allowed the amplitude , width , and velocity to vary for each spectral component from epoch to epoch .",
    "finding consistent and stable solutions from the fitting algorithm required experimentation with the initial parameters used by the fitting algorithm , and many trials were required to determine the final accelerations .",
    "we found it convenient to divide the spectra into 15  30 km s@xmath2 segments , selected by choosing edges near local minima in the profile .",
    "we then solved for accelerations in each segment separately .",
    "we began the fitting process using initial parameters describing equally spaced spectral components across the velocity range of interest . in the initial trials we spaced spectral components by about 4 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we then added components in later trials until the solution was satisfactory .",
    "after each trial , we judged the results by examining the fits and residuals at each epoch .",
    "figure 3 gives an example of the gaussian components and residuals determined from a good fit to a section of the data among the systemic components .",
    "we also compared the fitted accelerations to the trends apparent in plots showing velocities of maser peaks over time , as in figure 2 .",
    "the line segments plotted in the central panel of figure 2 correspond to accelerations measured from the global fit , while the plus symbols represent the velocities of maser peaks determined by eye from each spectrum .",
    "where the fit accelerations were clearly in disagreement with the trends in velocities of the maser peaks , we rejected the solution and tried a new set of initial parameters . when the residuals were poor over the entire velocity range being fitted , we added components and maintained equal velocity spacing .",
    "when the residuals were poor only in a narrow range of the velocities being fit , we kept a base set of equally - spaced spectral components and inserted additional spectral components at the specific velocities where the residuals were unsatisfactory .",
    "a good fit to masers in the systemic velocity range typically required that we use one gaussian component for every 2  3 km s@xmath2 of velocity space being fit .",
    "we confirmed that the solutions remained stable and consistent near the edges of each segment by running test cases with overlap on the segment boundaries .",
    "it is apparent in figure 2 that the fitting algorithm is able to find stable solutions even in parts of the spectrum where there are no distinct peaks in the spectral profile . in these",
    "velocity ranges the emission lines are typically weak or heavily blended .",
    "we note , however , that the data used in the final distance analysis come only from velocity ranges where there are both distinct peaks detected by eye , and stable solutions determined from the fitting algorithm .    for high - velocity lines we used data from all 36 epochs to fit for acceleration .",
    "the small accelerations among high - velocity lines make it possible to track lines for long durations and obtain stable solutions using data for all 3.2 years of monitoring . for the systemic features , however , we found that using all 36 epochs made the global solution unstable .",
    "fitting systemic lines using all epochs may be complicated by the appearance and disappearance of many fast - drifting spectral components , making it difficult to account for all components over long durations .",
    "our aim is to determine accelerations appropriate for the vlbi observing date of 2006 december 10 .",
    "we therefore fit accelerations of systemic components using a subset of the epochs roughly centered on this date , and including at least the epochs between 09 september 2006 and 14 april 2007 . in figure 2",
    ", the lengths of the line segments showing the acceleration fits represent the number of epochs used in each fit .    in figure 4",
    "we show the best - fit accelerations for each maser line as measured by the global least - squares fit .",
    "the redshifted lines have a mean value of -0.13 @xmath1 0.04 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2 and the blueshifted lines have a mean of -0.16 @xmath1 0.04 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2 . here",
    "we quote unweighted , standard errors of the mean .",
    "accelerations of the systemic features are consistent with the preliminary work of bg08 and range from 0.5 to 7.3 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2 .",
    "tables 2  4 list the accelerations measured for each line .",
    "the uncertainties listed in these tables are formal values from the global fit , and may underestimate the true uncertainties .",
    "in this section we discuss the `` megamaser disk method '' for measuring the angular - diameter distance to a galaxy based on a straightforward model of the maser emission arising from an edge - on keplerian disk .",
    "this model gives a good approximation to the maser emission from ngc 4258 . to measure the distance to ugc 3789",
    ", we make a simple extension of this model , as presented in section 5 .",
    "first we consider a model in which maser emission originates in a thin , flat , edge - on disk and the dynamics are dominated by a central massive object , with all maser clouds in circular orbits . in this model , high - velocity masers trace gas near the disk midline .",
    "systemic masers occupy part of a ring orbiting at a single radius , and covering a small range of azimuthal angles on the near side of the disk .",
    "when plotted on a position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram , the high - velocity masers trace a keplerian rotation curve and the systemic masers fall on a line segment . if the line segment is extended to the rotation curve traced by the high - velocity features ( as in the dotted lines shown in figure 3 of paper i ) , the intersecting points ( @xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16 ) determine both the angular radius ( @xmath17 ) and magnitude of the rotation velocity ( @xmath18 ) of the narrow ring traced by systemic masers , according to @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in this model ,",
    "the angular - diameter distance to the galaxy is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the radius of the ring traced by the systemic maser components ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is the centripetal acceleration of systemic components , measured from the change in doppler velocity with time .    in practice",
    ", we do not measure @xmath17 and @xmath18 directly .",
    "instead we measure the keplerian rotation constant @xmath25 , which we determine by fitting the high - velocity lines to the rotation curve @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , we measure a curvature parameter @xmath27 , which is the slope of the line traced by systemic features on the p - v diagram ( @xmath28 for the systemic features ) . with this parametrization ,",
    "we can write the angular - diameter distance to the galaxy as @xmath29 the fractional uncertainty in @xmath30 is @xmath31    here we use a notation in which the uncertainty in a measured or derived value , @xmath32 , is represented as @xmath33 , so the fractional uncertainty in @xmath32 is @xmath34 .    the straightforward method for measuring the angular - diameter distance described above works well for ngc 4258 , where systemic accelerations fall in the range 7.7  8.9 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2 ( humphreys et al 2008 ) , indicating they are seen within a narrow range of radii , @xmath22 , from the central black hole ( @xmath35 1/@xmath36 ) . the tightly confined range of radii in ngc 4258 is a consequence of the masers forming in the bottom of a bowl - shaped region of the warped accretion disk ( humphreys et al .",
    "while it may be fortuitous that the systemic masers prefer a single radius , we note that the high - velocity features in ngc 4258 also seem to prefer specific radii , and even show periodicity suggestive of spiral structure ( maoz 1995 , humphreys et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the masers in ugc 3789 also appear to cluster around discrete radii from the black hole . in figure 5",
    "we reproduce the vlbi map presented in paper i. the `` red '' features in particular are seen mainly at three distinct radii from the central black hole .",
    "evidence that the systemic features are also clustered in radius comes from the acceleration profile ( figure 4 ) , as we describe in the next section .",
    "except for the westernmost `` red '' maser , all the high - velocity maser lines in ugc 3789 fall on a straight line , within the measurement uncertainties ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the line has a position angle of 41.1@xmath37 , east of north .",
    "the maser distribution is consistent with emission from a thin , edge - on disk .",
    "the systemic maser spots show systematic deviations from the line defined by the high - velocity masers , with the easternmost systemic masers appearing north of the line and the westernmost systemic masers south of it . one way to interpret",
    "this arrangement is that the near side of the disk , traced by the systemic masers , is warped while the high - velocity lines trace a part of the disk that appears relatively unwarped from our point of view .",
    "we define an `` impact parameter '' for each maser spot as the projection of its angular offset onto the line defined by the high - velocity masers , with an impact parameter @xmath38 identifying the location of the dynamical center . to determine the impact parameters , we rotated the map on the sky by 48.9@xmath37 ( counterclockwise , when viewed as in figure 5 ) and measured the impact parameter for each maser component by its abscissa on the rotated axes .    when modeling the data , we corrected the recorded `` optical '' velocities of all maser spots for relativistic effects , as in argon et al .",
    "first we recalculated each velocity using the relativistic doppler formula .",
    "we estimated the black hole mass using these velocities , then corrected for the gravitational time dilation caused by the central black hole .",
    "finally we corrected velocities of the systemic features for the relativistic transverse doppler effect .",
    "the effect of the relativistic corrections is to reduce the measured optical velocities by 12  27 km s@xmath2 , the blueshifted features getting the smaller corrections .",
    "we then used these corrected velocities in all of the analysis , including the determination of the final black hole mass reported in this paper .",
    "as a matter of convenience in fitting for the keplerian rotation constant @xmath25 , we write the impact parameter @xmath17 in terms of the independent variable , @xmath39 : @xmath40 .",
    "uncertainties in the velocities are negligible compared to those in the impact parameters and are ignored in this analysis .",
    "we find the best fit has @xmath14 per degree of freedom of 8.5 , so we scale the @xmath41 uncertainty by @xmath42 .",
    "we therefore determine @xmath43 km s@xmath2 mas@xmath44 .",
    "the best - fit value for the recession velocity from the fit to the keplerian rotation curve is 3270 @xmath1 4 km s@xmath2 ( relativistic velocity ) .",
    "the apparently large @xmath14 per degree of freedom results from small - amplitude perturbations in the positions and velocities of maser components , as might be expected , for example , with position - velocity perturbations from spiral density waves . in this analysis ,",
    "the position of the black hole along the disk plane ( @xmath38 ) is treated as a free parameter .",
    "if we were to fix @xmath38 to the centroid of the systemic maser spots , 0.04 mas from the best - fit position , we would measure @xmath45 km s@xmath2 mas@xmath44 .",
    "the difference in @xmath25 is insignificant in the calculation of distance , but it suggests that the formal uncertainty in @xmath25 may underestimate the true value . to be conservative",
    ", we use @xmath46 km s@xmath2 mas@xmath44 in our calculations , noting that @xmath25 is still a negligible contributor to the total error in the distance .",
    "the wide range of systemic accelerations measured in ugc 3789 ( 0.5  7.3 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2 ) indicates that the systemic maser emission is observed over a larger range of radial distance from the black hole than in ngc 4258 .",
    "accelerations on the low - velocity end of the systemic spectrum are primarily in the range 1  2 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2 , while those on the high - velocity end are primarily 4  6 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2 . this distribution suggests that the maser clouds lie mainly in two rings",
    ". we will identify masers having observed velocities of 3232 @xmath47 c@xmath12 @xmath47 3271 km s@xmath2 with `` ring 1 '' and those having 3292 @xmath47 c@xmath12 @xmath47 3318 km s@xmath2 with `` ring 2 '' , where here we use the optical convention for velocities , as in table 3 .",
    "the mean accelerations are 1.50 @xmath1 0.13 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2 for ring 1 , and 4.96 @xmath1 0.34 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2 for ring 2 .",
    "the uncertainties here are unweighted , standard errors of the mean .",
    "masers with intervening velocities in the range 3271  3292 km s@xmath2 have more scattered accelerations and are not considered in this analysis .",
    "we note that there is a distinct separation even in the single - dish spectrum between masers associated with ring 1 and those with ring 2 ( figure 1 lower panel ) .    in this analysis",
    ", we include the approximation that all the high - velocity masers fall on the midline , so individual accelerations of high - velocity features do not enter into the distance calculation directly .",
    "although the high - velocity lines have accelerations near zero , the tendency to negative values suggests that they form slightly on the back side of the disk midline .",
    "the uncertainty in the distance to ugc 3789 introduced by this deviation is not significant compared to our measurement uncertainties .",
    "figure 6 shows the distribution of systemic maser features on a p - v diagram . rather than tracing a single line , as would be expected if all masers were at a common radial distance from the central black hole , there is a kink in the distribution with the masers on each side of the kink roughly defining a line .",
    "the distribution is consistent with the masers being detected primarily in two rings . in figure 6",
    "we use unique symbols to differentiate the masers associated with each of the rings . we can measure the slope @xmath27 separately for each ring : @xmath48 km s@xmath2 mas@xmath2 for ring 1 and @xmath49 km s@xmath2 mas@xmath2 for ring 2 .",
    "the poorer fit for ring 2 results , in part , from that ring covering a narrower velocity range than ring 1 , so it has fewer spectral channels to fit from the vlbi map .",

    "<S> the map reveals an edge - on , sub - parsec disk in keplerian rotation , analogous to the megamaser disk in ngc 4258 . </S>",
    "<S> here we present 3.2 years of monthly gbt observations of the megamaser disk in ugc 3789 . </S>",
    "<S> we use these observations to measure the centripetal accelerations of both the systemic and high - velocity maser components . </S>",
    "<S> the measured accelerations suggest that maser emission lines near the systemic velocity originate on the front side of the accretion disk , primarily from segments of two narrow rings . adopting a two - ring model for the systemic features , we determine the angular - diameter distance to ugc 3789 to be 49.9 @xmath1 7.0 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> this is the most accurate geometric distance yet obtained to a galaxy in the hubble flow . </S>",
    "<S> based on this distance , we determine @xmath0 = 69 @xmath1 11 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also measure the mass of the central black hole to be 1.09 @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 . with additional observations the uncertainty in the distance to this galaxy </S>",
    "<S> can be reduced to under 10% . </S>",
    "<S> observations of megamaser disks in other galaxies will further reduce the uncertainty in @xmath0 as measured by the mcp . </S>"
