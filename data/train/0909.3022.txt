    "observing two - dimensional velocity fields of distant , small and faint galaxies is still challenging and very time consuming with 3d - spectrographs even at large telescopes .",
    "we took , therefore , another , more efficient approach that makes advantage of the mxu mode of the fors2 instrument at the vlt that allows to cut individual slits of any orientation into a slit mask @xcite . for any given target ,",
    "we observe three different slit positions with a central 1-wide slit along the photometric major axis and two adjacent ones shifted by 1  along the minor axis .",
    "since the slit length is not limited , we cover the full extent of the galaxy disk along its major axis with good spatial sampling of 0.25/pixel allowing to measure the rotation curve out to its flat part .",
    "although the three slit positions require the observation of three different masks , our method is still very efficient since we can target 2530 galaxies with the same mask . and to achieve the necessary @xmath3 a total integration time per mask of 2.5h is sufficient thanks to the high throughput of fors2 and the usage of a vph grism .",
    "the chosen grism ( ) has the additional advantage that it provides a long wavelength range of 3000 .",
    "thus , most spectra of our targets encompass 4 ( up to 7 ) emission lines and many more absorption lines that can be used together to determine the rotation of the stellar component of the galaxy .",
    "each emission line instead , allows to measure the kinematics of the warm gas . a full two - dimensional velocity field ( vf ) for each emission line can be constructed by a careful combination of all data points from the three slit positions @xcite .",
    "since such a vf has an adequate spatial sampling for typical seeing and matches the angular size of the disk , we can analyze it quantitatively with , a package originally developed for local sauron galaxies @xcite . from fitting elliptical velocity profiles , position angles and flattenings",
    "are found as a function of radius .",
    "deviations from the best fits are analyzed with a fourier expansion , that traces not only the bulk motion but also indicates deviations from simple rotation or separate kinematic components . as an example , we show in figure1 a member of a cluster at @xmath4 providing a thumbnail from the hst / acs image and displaying the observed vf .",
    "the middle panels show the reconstructed vf using a fourier expansion to order 6 and its residual by subtracting the model from the data .",
    "we can find the global kinematic axis by averaging the radial position angles and flattenings . with these values fixed for the whole galaxy ,",
    "a simple rotation map can be created , which is shown together with its residual in the lower panels .",
    "this galaxy has a rather smooth and regular vf , but its ( gas ) kinematic axis is rotated with respect to its ( stellar ) photometric axis .",
    "such a behavour may be caused by smooth accretion of gas infalling from one direction only , e.g. along a filament .",
    "to detect irregularities quantitatively in a vf and in the same manner for all galaxies , we define three parameters : 1 . )",
    "@xmath5 : the standard deviation of the kinematic position angles , 2 . )",
    "@xmath6 : an average value of the 3rd and 5th - order fourier coefficients normalised by the rotation velocity , and 3 . ) @xmath7 : the mean difference between photometric and kinematic position angles across the galaxy . while the first two trace the gas kinematics only , the last one indicates a misalignment between the stellar and gas disks . to find the proper value range , for which these parameters are still compatible with undisturbed motions",
    ", we first analyzed 18 local ( mostly field ) galaxies from the sings sample @xcite that have higher @xmath3 and spatial sampling .",
    "next , we analyze the vfs of 16 cluster ( ms1008.1 - 1224 @xmath8 , ms2137.3 - 2353 @xmath4 , cl0412 - 65 @xmath9 , ms0451.6 - 0305 @xmath10 ) and 29 field ( @xmath11 ) galaxies @xcite . the fraction of irregular galaxies above the respective thresholds is lower for the vf tracers ( 10% and 30% ) than for the misalignment @xmath7 ( 70% ) .",
    "their abundance and distribution is similar for both the cluster and field population ( fig.2 ) .",
    "while a high @xmath7 can sometimes also be caused by the presence of a strong bar ( we have 4 cases ) , we find correlations with recent star formation events indicated by blue colors and clumpy substructures .",
    "also a trend is seen with smaller disk sizes and lower stellar masses ( which we determine from stellar population fits to our multiband photometry ) .",
    "there are many more distant field galaxies with disturbed vfs than in the local sample . on the other hand ,",
    "emission - line galaxies at @xmath1 from the sins project compatible with a major merger scenario display stronger distortions in the fourier analysis @xcite .",
    "considering all three samples , we conclude that many spiral galaxies at @xmath2 have not yet settled into their final configuration but are still building - up their disks .",
    "since they exhibit mostly weaker irregularities , the dominant processes in this later cosmic epoch are probably minor mergers and gas accretion .",
    "our cluster members also have mainly irregularities in their vfs that can be caused by rather subtle than violent processes . among cluster - specific interactions ,",
    "good candidates are events that strip gas from the galaxy but leave the stellar disk with ordered motion .",
    "since almost all our cluster galaxies are located ( in projection ) within half the cluster virial radius , those processes can be ram ",
    "pressure stripping by the intracluster medium , thermal evaporation or harassment due to scattering with cluster substructure and with other cluster members . for these interactions",
    "we find similar kinematic irregularities in our n - body / sph simulations @xcite . among those cluster members that have quite regular vfs are probably also galaxies that are just infalling from the surrounding field , which entered our sample due to projection . to characterize our distant galaxies even more , we will in future also analyze their gas metallicities , chemistry and stellar populations",
