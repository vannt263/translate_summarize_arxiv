    "the black hole candidate ( bhc ) was first observed with the _ einstein _ observatory by hertz & grindlay ( 1984 ) .",
    "it lies @xmath0 away from the centre of the galaxy and it is the brightest persistent source within a few degrees of the galactic centre ( gc ) above @xmath140  kev @xcite .",
    "the source usually shows a hard x - ray spectrum characteristic of bhcs in their low / hard state ; the x - ray emission is strongly attenuated by a high hydrogen column density @xmath2  @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "+ interest in this source increased when mirabel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) discovered double - side jets in radio emission that classified the source as microquasar .",
    "it has also been suggested as a possible positron - electron annihilation source due to a sigma ( french instrument on - board of the _ granat _ satellite ) observation of the 511  kev line @xcite from 1e 1740.7 - 2942 .",
    "actually , a definitive confirmation has been not reported so far .",
    "+ we present some results collected during the first year of guaranteed time observations . this paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we describe the data set we have used and the performed analysis . in section 3",
    ", we report on imaging , temporal , and spectral analysis results obtained with the imager ibis .",
    "we focus on the temporal behaviour and spectral variability of a data sub - set , that is when the instrument achieves its best performances .",
    "the gc region has been frequently pointed by the satellite @xcite during its guaranteed time observations ( core programme ) .",
    "the core programme consists of a deep exposure of the galactic centre ( gcde ) and regular scans of the galactic plane ( gps ) , plus some pointed observations . during the first year the gcde observing time was 4.8  ms ; as part of these observations , the region including has been pointed for @xmath11.4  ms .",
    "+ in this paper we present results of the first year of monitoring obtained with ibis @xcite , the imager on board satellite .",
    "+ ibis is a coded mask telescope consisting of two detector layers , isgri @xcite and picsit @xcite ; herein we refer only to the data collected by the isgri detector .",
    "the ibis partially coded field of view ( pcfov ) is 29@xmath429@xmath5 at zero response , but the full instrument sensitivity is achieved in the 9@xmath49@xmath5 fully coded field of view ( fcfov ) .",
    "+ by considering the coding effect of the instrument , during the first year of core programme the effective exposure time for was @xmath1790  ks .",
    "basically , such a value ( corrected for the dead - time ) is calculated by multiplying the pointing exposure time by a vignetting map which is equal to 1 in the fcfov and decreases to zero at the borders of the pcfov .",
    "+ the total number of pointings , or science windows ( scws ) , is 782 , covering a period of 7 months between march 2003 , revolution ( rev . ) 50 , and october 2003 , rev .",
    "122 ( the julian date interval corresponds to 1166.39 @xmath6 1382.77 ) .",
    "+ raw data have been pre - processed and distributed by the integral science data center @xcite .",
    "the ibis scientific data analysis has been performed by using the off - line analysis software ( osa ) release 3.0 @xcite , ftools 5.2 adapted to the fits files format by the heasarc software team .",
    "the energy ranges selected for the imaging and temporal analysis are : 20 - 40  kev , 40 - 80  kev , 80 - 120  kev , and 120 - 250  kev .",
    "the light curves have been extracted from the images of each scw : they have a binning time of @xmath11800  s that is the mean duration of each gcde pointing .",
    "+ a logarithmic binning table with 16 energy channels has been chosen for spectral extraction .",
    "note that the response matrix for partially coded sources is not available yet , therefore we performed the spectral analysis of a sub - set of the whole data set : 66 pointings with the source in the fcfov for a total exposure time of @xmath1120  ks .",
    "+ we used a _",
    "renormalized _ effective area , in the sense that some systematics may be partially taken into account by introducing _",
    "post facto _ corrections using the crab as a standard candle @xcite ; in spite of this , we still need to assume a 2% systematic error in order to obtain good fits .",
    "+ spectral fitting have been performed with the standard xspec v.11.2 tools and all parameters errors have been calculated at 90% of confidence level .",
    "the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) proportional counter array ( pca ) has been periodically monitoring since the first week of spacecraft science operations in 1996 .",
    "+ these began as monthly pointings of 1000 - 1500  s and have increased over the years until they take place twice a week .",
    "this frequency has been found to sample some of the more rapid state changes , and the data quality is sufficient to look for small spectral changes within the standard so called low / hard state , and to measure the approximate level of fast variability , for each pointing .",
    "+ nearby sources are excluded by placing the centre of the 1@xmath5 field of view about 0.5@xmath5 away from , and the strong galactic diffuse background is subtracted with the help of pointings to an empty field symmetrically positioned across the gc . + this monitoring campaign has been used to discover an unexpected temporal relation between spectral shape and luminosity in this source , very different from cyg x-1 @xcite ; to identify state changes promptly @xcite ; and to find the orbital period of the system , estimated as 12.73@xmath70.05 days @xcite .           in the fcfov of individual maps ( corresponding to a single scw ) ,",
    "is detected in the range 20 - 40  kev at a level of confidence of @xmath8 and at a level of @xmath9 at @xmath10 from the centre of the fov .",
    "+ in the energy range 40 - 80 kev , it is detectable up to offset angles of @xmath112@xmath5 ; on the contrary , between 80 and 120 kev it has been detected in only a few pointings ( less than 200 scws ) .",
    "the 20 - 40  kev mosaic of 370 significance maps ( @xmath11  s ) is shown in figure [ fig : pc_20_40 ] : numerous sources are detected by ibis / isgri around , which is in the centre of the map at a detection level of @xmath12 . + in figure [ fig : fv_20_40 ] two mosaics for two different energy bands built with 66 maps when was in the fcfov are shown . in the gc zone ,",
    "the only two sources detected up to 250  kev are two bhcs : and the transient source @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      light curves corresponding to the first 3 selected energy ranges are shown in figure [ fig : lc_t ] . at low energy we detected in 460 scws .",
    "we decided to reject all the scws with statistical errors not determined by the software .",
    "+ on the first plot ( top ) the _ rxte_/pca light curve in the energy range 8 - 25  kev is superimposed . as can be seen ,",
    "the two temporal profiles look consistent during the simultaneous observations .",
    "+ in the two energy ranges 40 - 80  kev ( middle ) and 80 - 120  kev ( bottom ) , the number of good scws we found is 371 and 180 respectively .",
    "+ some systematic errors could still affect the count rate evaluation , because the instrumental off - axis response has not been fully evaluated yet .",
    "because of that , we also extracted light curves considering only scws with the source in the fcfov .",
    "these observations cover three time intervals : rev .",
    "53 - 62 , rev .",
    "103 , and rev .",
    "119 - 120 . +",
    "as it is shown in figure [ fig : lc_f ] , there is no evidence of flux variation within each of the two periods , while on a longer time scale there is a clear indication of a 30% increase .",
    "the mean value of the count rate and the variance have been calculated in the energy range 20 - 40  kev : with osa 3 software we obtain 4.7@xmath70.3 ct / s and 6.9@xmath70.2 ct / s as mean rates within the first and second period respectively .",
    "+ considering mcrab , such increase comes from 41  mcrab up to 61  mcrab in isgri from 20 - 40  kev . ] . on the contrary , during the third period the source decreased above 30 mcrab .",
    "the later ( more recent ) integral observations @xcite showed that the source flux declined below the isgri sensitivity limit ( @xmath11.7 mcrab , 3 @xmath13 ) by march 2004 .",
    "+ hereafter we refer to the spectral analysis performed by using the first and the second period data set . +      in order to search for spectral variations , we evaluated the hardness ratio defined as : @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the count rate in the 40 - 80  kev and 20 - 40  kev energy ranges respectively .",
    "+ performing a @xmath17 test , no spectral variations have been found within each of the two periods . in figure",
    "[ fig : hr ] , the hardness ratios and the models employed for the fit have been plotted : both fits are consistent with a constant model with roughly the same value .",
    "+ in addition , all spectra ( in the range 20 - 80  kev ) extracted from each scw have been fitted by a single power law . in a single gcde",
    "pointing , the source intensity and low counting statistics do not allow us to constrain the cut - off .",
    "the aim of this analysis was to investigate a possible correlation between the photon index and the flux : no relation has been found , as is clearly visible in figure [ fig : fl_ind ] .",
    "+ since a simple power law does not allow a good fit ( @xmath18=7 ) , the averaged spectrum corresponding to the first period ( 57 spectra ) has been fitted by a cut - off power law ( figure [ fig : cpl_i_p ] ) .",
    "a fit with a @xmath18=1.4 has been obtained with a photon index @xmath19 and a high energy cut - off @xmath20  kev .",
    "+ we also fitted the averaged spectrum from the second data set , consisting of 9 spectra at the higher flux level , both using the empirical cut - off power law model and the physical thermal comptonization @xcite model ( ` comptt ` in xspec ) .",
    "the empirical model gives @xmath21 and @xmath22  kev with a @xmath23 .",
    "+ in the two fluxes state , even though the parameters are a little bit different , they are consistent within the errors , confirming the hardness ratio result .",
    "+ a good fit ( @xmath24 ) on the second data set has been also obtained by using the ` comptt ` model ( figure [ fig : comptt ] ) .",
    "following , the comptonization parameters that we have found : a plasma temperature ( kt ) of @xmath25  kev and a thompson optical depth @xmath26 .",
    "the flux estimated between 20 and 250  kev was @xmath27  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath28 .",
    "+ the ` comptt ` model does not allow a good fit to the first data set because the low statistic does not permit to constrain the fit parameters .",
    "the bhc has been detected by ibis / isgri up to 250 kev in @xmath1120  ks . during the seven months of monitoring , we measured for this source a flux variation up to 50% on a time scale of months , but without any change in spectral shape .",
    "the source 20 - 40 kev flux increased from 40  mcrab up to 60  mcrab and then decreased to roughly 30  mcrab during october 2003 .",
    "+ in the ibis / isgri energy range , the spectral shape is typical of the bhcs in their low / hard state .",
    "+ the empirical model achieves an energy cut - off of about 40  kev , while a 22  kev comptonization temperature and an optical depth @xmath26 have been found by using the thermal comptonization fit .",
    "such a result is consistent with the bepposax galactic centre observations performed with the source at the same flux level @xcite . + in order to study the source behaviour by using a broad band spectrum , we plan to continue with analysis of the jem - x and spi data as well .",
    "+ in conclusion , we underline the ibis fine imaging capabilities , especially in crowded field like the galactic centre .",
    "this paper is based on observations with integral , an esa project with instruments and science data centre funded by esa member states ( especially the pi countries : denmark , france , germany , italy , switzerland , spain ) , czech republic and poland , and with participation of russia and usa .",
