    "while the word chaos is widely used in science and mathematics , there are a variety of ways of defining it .",
    "thus , for this 25th anniversary issue of the journal chaos , we are motivated to review issues that arise when attempting to formulate a generally applicable definition of chaos , and to advocate a particular entropy - based definition that seems to us to be especially apt .",
    "we also relate our proposed definition to previous definitions .",
    "intuitively , perhaps the two most prominent ( not necessarily independent ) attributes of what scientists commonly think of as chaos are the presence of complex orbit structure and extreme sensitivity of orbits to small perturbations . indeed , in the paper by li and yorke@xcite where the term chaos was introduced in its now widely accepted nonlinear dynamics context , the term was motivated by the simultaneous presence of unstable periodic orbits of all periods , as well as an uncountable infinity of non - periodic orbits .",
    "thus , li and yorke s introduction of this terminology was motivated by the chaos attribute of complex orbit structure . on the other hand ,",
    "lorenz@xcite was concerned with weather forecasting and accordingly focused on the chaos attribute of temporally exponential increase of the sensitivity of orbit locations to small initial perturbations .",
    "as we will discuss , these two attributes can be viewed as `` two sides of the same coin '' .",
    "we think of a definition of chaos as being `` good '' if it conforms to common intuitive notions of chaos ( such as complex orbit structure and orbit sensitivity ) and , at the same time , has the following three desirable features :    * _ generality _ : the definition should work for almost all the examples that typical readers of this journal are likely to judge as chaotic . *",
    "_ simplicity _ : the definition should be fairly concise and not too technical . *",
    "_ computability _ : the definition should allow a practical , straightforward computational implementation for discerning the existence of chaos in a model .    considering the issue of generality , one would like a definition of chaos to be applicable not only to attractors , but also to non - attracting sets , often called repellers . with respect to chaotic repellers@xcite , we note that they are central to the physically relevant topics of fractal basin boundaries@xcite , chaotic transients , and chaotic scattering@xcite , occurring , for example in fluid dynamics@xcite , celestial mechanics@xcite , chemistry@xcite , and atomic physics@xcite .",
    "furthermore , again considering the issue of generality , due to their common occurrence in applications , we desire that our definition of chaos be applicable to non - autonomous dynamical systems ( i.e. , systems that are externally forced by time dependent inputs ) , including external inputs that are temporally quasi - periodic@xcite , stochastic@xcite , or are themselves chaotic . here",
    "physical examples include quasi - periodic forcing of atmospheric jets@xcite , quasi - periodic forcing of stellar luminosity variation by two superposed stellar modal oscillations@xcite , advective transport in fluids with temporally and spatially irregular flow fields@xcite , and phase synchronism of chaos by noisy or chaotic drives@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that , when considering externally forced systems , we are interested in identifying chaos in the response of the system to a particular realization of the forcing , not in characterizing whether the forcing is chaotic .    an important point for consideration of non - periodically forced chaotic systems is that the notion of a compact invariant set , which is typically used in definitions of chaos for autonomous systems ( including poincar maps of periodically forced systems ) , may not be appropriate or convenient for situations with non - periodic forcing .",
    "furthermore , in practice , it may be difficult to locate or detect an invariant set that is not an attractor .",
    "thus , rather than defining chaos for an invariant set , we will instead consider a notion of chaos for the dynamics within any given bounded positive - volume subset @xmath0 of the state space .",
    "we call such a set @xmath0 a _ restraining region_. for autonomous systems , chaos for an invariant set can be detected by taking @xmath0 to be a neighborhood of the desired invariant set .    in our opinion ,",
    "the currently most satisfactory way of defining chaos for autonomous systems is by the existence of positive topological entropy or metric entropy .",
    "we note , however , that the standard definitions of these entropies are quite difficult to straightforwardly implement in a numerical procedure .",
    "in addition , while generalizations to the original definitions of topological and metric entropy have been proposed , we view it as desirable to have a relatively simple definition that is applicable very broadly .",
    "however , we do not address here the question of identifying chaos in experimental data , which presents additional challenges , especially in the cases of non - attracting sets and externally forced systems .",
    "motivated by the considerations above , in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce and discuss the definition of an alternate entropy quantity that we call `` expansion entropy '' .",
    "the expansion entropy of an @xmath1-dimensional dynamical system on a restraining region @xmath0 is the difference between two asymptotic exponential rates : first , the maximum over @xmath2 of the rate at which the system expands @xmath3-dimensional volume within @xmath0 ; and second , the rate at which @xmath1-dimensional volume leaves @xmath0 ( this rate is @xmath4 for an invariant set ) .",
    "_ we define chaos as the existence of positive expansion entropy on a given restraining region . _ expansion entropy generalizes ( to nonautonomous systems and noninvariant restraining regions ) a quantity that was formulated by sacksteder and shub@xcite in the case of an autonomous system on a compact manifold . in this restricted case , by the results of kozlovski@xcite , expansion entropy is equal to topological entropy for infinitely differentiable maps . in sec .",
    "[ sec2.6 ] we present examples of the application of our definition of expansion entropy to various systems , and also provide illustrative numerical evaluations of expansion entropy for some of these examples .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] discusses topological entropy and previous work on computation of this quantity .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] discusses issues that arise in previous non - entropy - based definitions of chaos .",
    "our definition of expansion entropy , which we denote @xmath5 , is closely related to previous definitions of topological entropy , to which it is equivalent under appropriate conditions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] ) .",
    "expansion entropy uses the linearization of the dynamical system and a notion of volume on its state space ; thus , unlike topological entropy , it is defined only for smooth dynamical systems . on the other hand ,",
    "expansion entropy does not require the identification of a compact invariant set .",
    "as we will discuss , the differences in the definitions may make the criterion @xmath6 attractive as a general definition of chaos in smooth dynamical systems .",
    "we assume that the state space of the dynamical system is a finite - dimensional manifold @xmath7 .",
    "( for example , if the manifold @xmath7 is @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space , the state @xmath8 at a given time is a vector @xmath9 $ ] where each @xmath10 is a real number .",
    "if some of the coordinates are angle variables , they can be taken modulo @xmath11 , resulting in manifolds such as a circle , cylinder or torus . )",
    "we write @xmath12 for the volume@xcite of a subset @xmath0 of @xmath7 , and write @xmath13 for integration with respect to this volume ; for @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space , one can take @xmath14 .",
    "given a dynamical system on @xmath7 , we will use an integral to define its expansion entropy on a closed subset @xmath0 ( the restraining region ) that has positive , finite volume .",
    "the set @xmath0 need not be invariant under the system .",
    "we consider a deterministic dynamical system to be defined by an evolution operator , by which we mean a family @xmath15 of maps @xmath16 , with the interpretation that if @xmath8 and @xmath17 are the states of the system at times @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , then @xmath20 . ( for example , @xmath21 could represent the solution from time @xmath18 to @xmath19 of a system of differential equations . )",
    "the family @xmath15 must satisfy the identities @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the maps @xmath21 are defined for @xmath24 being integer - valued ( discrete time ) or being real numbers ( continuous time ) , with the restriction that @xmath25 if the system is noninvertible .",
    "we allow the system to be nonautonomous , including the case where @xmath21 is a realization of a stochastic dynamical system.@xcite if the system is autonomous , then @xmath21 depends only on @xmath26 , and in this case we will often write @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "regardless , we assume that @xmath21 is a differentiable function of @xmath8 .",
    "recall that the singular values of a matrix @xmath29 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath30 .",
    "thinking of @xmath29 as a linear transformation , the image of the unit ball under @xmath29 is an ellipsoid , and the singular values of @xmath29 are the semiaxes of this ellipsoid .",
    "let @xmath31 be the product of the singular values of @xmath29 that are greater than @xmath32 ; if none of the singular values are greater than @xmath32 , let @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath31 is roughly the number of @xmath34-balls needed to cover the image of an @xmath34-ball under @xmath29 .",
    "if the matrix @xmath29 is @xmath35 , consider a @xmath3-dimensional plane @xmath36 in @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space , where @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath37 be a @xmath3-dimensional ball in @xmath36 , let @xmath38 denote the image of @xmath37 under @xmath29 , and let @xmath39 denote @xmath3-dimensional volume .",
    "then @xmath31 is the maximum over orientations of @xmath36 and over @xmath3 of @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath31 is the largest possible growth ratio of @xmath3-dimensional volumes under @xmath29_. below we will apply @xmath41 to the derivative matrix @xmath42 , in which case it represents a",
    "volume growth ratio for the ( typically nonlinear ) map @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath43 be the set of @xmath8 such that @xmath44 for all @xmath45 between @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( that is , the trajectory of @xmath8 from @xmath18 to @xmath19 under @xmath15 never leaves @xmath0 ) .",

    "imagine that @xmath54 initial conditions are uniformly sprinkled throughout the volume of @xmath0 at time @xmath18 , and that @xmath54 is very large ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the second term @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2a ] ) is then the exponential decay rate , as @xmath19 increases , of the number of trajectories from these initial conditions that remain in @xmath0 for all times between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the quantity @xmath57 is the average over these remaining trajectories of the maximum local @xmath3-dimensional volume growth ratio along the trajectory .",
    "thus , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq2a ] ) is the exponential growth rate of this average .",
    "it can be shown that the exponential growth rate of @xmath58 as @xmath59 is the sum of the positive lyapunov exponents of the trajectory starting at @xmath8 at time @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the limit in eq .",
    "( [ eq2a ] ) is , in a sense , an average of this sum of positive lyapunov exponents over trajectories that remain in @xmath0 for all ( forward ) time .",
    "the criterion @xmath6 , which we propose for defining chaos , requires that this exponential volume growth rate strictly exceed the exponential rate @xmath56 at which trajectories leave @xmath0 .",
    "note that if @xmath0 is forward invariant , e.g. , an absorbing neighborhood of an attractor , then @xmath60 .",
    "some points of interest for this entropy definition are that    1 .",
    "it applies to non - autonomous systems , 2 .",

    "it directly suggests a computational technique for numerically estimating @xmath5 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec2.3 ] ) .",
    "finally , notice that @xmath61 this property follows from the fact that @xmath62 if @xmath63 , and consequently @xmath64 .",
    "thus , if there is chaos according to the definition @xmath6 with respect to a restraining region @xmath65 , then there is also chaos with respect to every restraining region @xmath0 that contains @xmath65 .",
    "in particular , as illustrated by the example in sec .",
    "[ sec2.6.6 ] , this implies that the expansion entropy will detect chaos ( @xmath6 ) within a restraining region @xmath0 when @xmath0 also contains a nonchaotic attractor , even when the chaos exists only on a repeller .      in this section , we show that the expansion entropy of an autonomous , invertible system is the same as the expansion entropy of the inverse system .",
    "( note that this is also true for the topological entropy ; see sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . )",
    "this equality results from the following identity for all invertible systems ( not necessarily autonomous ) : @xmath66 to verify this identity , notice that @xmath67 is the inverse of @xmath21 .",

    "[ sec2.1 ] , we can imagine a computation of @xmath5 proceeding as follows .",
    "first , randomly sprinkle a large number of initial conditions @xmath81 uniformly in @xmath0 . then evolve each trajectory @xmath82 and the corresponding tangent map @xmath83 forward in time , continuing to evolve only as long as the trajectory remains in @xmath0 . at a discrete sequence of times @xmath84 ,",
    "compute @xmath85 where the prime on the summation symbol signifies that only those @xmath86 values for which @xmath82 remains in @xmath0 up to time @xmath18 are included in the sum . from our definition of @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we see that @xmath87 is an estimate of @xmath88 .",
    "plotting @xmath89 versus @xmath84 , for sufficiently large @xmath54 and @xmath84 , we expect to find an approximately linear relationship .",
    "accordingly , we can estimate @xmath5 as the slope of a straight line fitted to such data ( see also jacobs et al.@xcite for a similar approach in two dimensions ) .    as in other such procedures , judgment and experimentation",
    "are called for in determining reliable choices of @xmath54 and the range of @xmath84 over which to do the fit , and such choices will be constrained by computer resources . in practice , we find it useful to choose a number , say @xmath90 , of different samples of size @xmath54 , compute @xmath89 for each sample , and take the mean and standard deviations of these logarithms .",
    "not only does this allow us to estimate the sampling error , it also produces a more reliable mean estimate than computing @xmath91 for a single sample of @xmath92 points .",
    "example illustrations of this computational approach are given in secs .",

    "the question then arises as to which of these two alternatives is preferable from the point of view of computational cost and accuracy . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we argue that it is computationally preferable to calculate @xmath5 from @xmath15 if @xmath15 is volume contracting in @xmath0 , while calculation from @xmath93 is preferable if @xmath15 is volume expanding in @xmath0 . in order to see this",

    "[ sec2.1 ] , the set of initial conditions at time @xmath4 whose trajectories under @xmath15 remain in @xmath0 between times @xmath4 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "that is , in terms of the previously stated numerical procedure for calculating the expansion entropy , @xmath56 is the exponential temporal decay rate of the number of initial conditions sprinkled uniformly throughout @xmath0 at time @xmath4 that lead to orbits that never leave @xmath0 up to time @xmath84 , while @xmath97 is the analogous quantity taking the initially sprinkled points backward from time @xmath4 to time @xmath98 .",
    "since , to estimate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we need to compute the average expansion rates only from those initial conditions that have not left @xmath0 , statistics at any given @xmath84 are improved when the number of such orbits is largest .",
    "further , the estimate of the limit @xmath99 dictates that we make @xmath84 large .",
    "these two considerations indicate that the forward ( respectively , backward ) calculation of @xmath5 will be computationally more efficient if @xmath100 ( respectively , @xmath101 ) . subtracting the definition ( [ eqx ] ) of @xmath56 from the definition of @xmath97 , and using the fact that @xmath102 for an autonomous invertible system , we obtain @xmath103 the right hand side is positive ( respectively , negative ) when the map is volume expanding ( respectively , contracting ) in @xmath0 . thus , @xmath101 if the map is volume expanding , while @xmath100 if the map is volume contracting . in particular , if @xmath0 is a neighborhood of an attractor , it is best to employ a forward time calculation .",
    "we note that the common examples of the hnon map and the lorenz system are uniformly volume contracting at all points in state space ( implying that @xmath104 ) , while hamiltonian systems are volume preserving ( implying that @xmath105 ) .      in past work on fractal dimension",
    ", the box - counting dimension has been generalized to a spectrum of dimensions often denoted @xmath107 , where the box - counting dimension corresponds to @xmath108 , and the index @xmath106 can be any nonnegative number@xcite .",
    "in addition , a spectrum of entropy - like quantities , again depending on an index @xmath109 , has been introduced by grassberger and procaccia@xcite , where @xmath108 corresponds to the topological entropy , and @xmath110 corresponds to the metric entropy .",
    "thus , motivated by these past works , it is natural to introduce an analogous spectrum of @xmath106-order expansion entropies , @xmath111 , and to consider whether they are useful with respect to the issue of defining chaos .",

    "however , as we will argue in appendix  [ appa ] , @xmath108 is special in regard to defining chaos .",

    "this definition can be converted to define devaney chaos for a compact invariant set , @xmath275 , by replacing @xmath7 in conditions ( ii ) and ( iii ) by @xmath244 , and condition ( i ) by `` @xmath15 has sensitive dependence on @xmath244 '' .",

    ", we see that , because of the quasi - periodic behavior of @xmath198 , there are no periodic orbits of this system .",

    "a system like ( [ eq5 ] ) can never exhibit chaos . yet",
    "quasi - periodically forced systems are of practical interest and can have attractors with a positive lyapunov exponent , a situation generally thought of as chaotic . another point to make in connection with the example ( [ eq5 ] )",
    "is that it presents a problem for the devaney definition of chaos even when @xmath41 is independent of @xmath198 : in that case @xmath278 , on its own , might indeed satisfy the conditions for devaney - chaos ; however , by considering the state to be @xmath279 with @xmath280 quasi - periodic , the devaney chaos condition ( ii ) is not satisfied , even though there is no change in the chaotic dynamics of @xmath281 .",
    "according to banks et al .",
    ", devaney - chaos only requires satisfaction of the two conditions that there be a dense orbit and a dense set of periodic orbits .",
    "robinson@xcite , on the other hand , notes that of the three conditions originally specified by devaney , the requirement of a dense set of periodic orbits does not seem as `` central to the idea of chaos '' as the other two conditions ( sensitive dependence and a dense orbit ) .",
    "thus he ( and also , independently , wiggins@xcite ) proposes the following definition .    *",
    "definition of robinson - chaos * : the same as devaney - chaos except that condition ( ii ) is deleted .",
    "this definition , by not requiring periodic orbits , has the benefit of potentially allowing more consistent treatment of forced systems , like ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "however , there is still , in our opinion , a drawback .",
    "this occurs , e.g. , with reference to the shear map example ( [ eqy ] ) of sec .",
    "[ sec2.6.3 ] , which was considered by robinson@xcite ( see also hunt and ott@xcite ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec2.6.3 ] , orbits are dense and nearby points typically separate linearly with @xmath18 .",
    "thus , this example is robinson chaotic .",
    "however , the two lyapunov exponents are zero . while this example satisfies the robinson - chaos definition , due to the slow , linear - in - time , separation of orbits , such dynamics",
    "has previously been classified as nonchaotic ( see literature on so - called strange nonchaotic attractors@xcite ) .",
    "indeed , this linear - in - time separation of nearby orbits presents comparatively little prediction difficulty as compared to the exponential divergence emphasized by lorenz .",
    "li and yorke@xcite define the notion of a `` scrambled set '' , and the presence of a scrambled set can be taken as another definition of chaos . while this works well in the original context of one - dimensional maps considered by li and yorke , as we will see",
    ", it is not as appropriate for higher dimensional systems .    *",
    "definition of a scrambled set * : for @xmath262 with @xmath7 a compact metric space , an uncountably infinite subset @xmath244 of @xmath7 is scrambled if , for every pair @xmath282 with @xmath283 , @xmath284    thus , by the second li - yorke condition , the orbits from @xmath8 and @xmath222 come arbitrarily close to each other an infinite number of times , while by the first li - yorke condition , the distance between the orbits from @xmath8 and @xmath222 also exceeds a fixed positive amount an infinite number of times .",
    "an attractive aspect of scrambling is that it excludes some cases that have sensitive dependence but are usually not considered chaotic . in particular , the shear map example ( [ eqy ] ) discussed above does not have a scrambled set because the @xmath198-distance ( or @xmath200-distance , if the @xmath198-distance is @xmath4 ) between a pair of orbits remains constant , thus violating the second li - yorke condition for scrambling .",
    "nevertheless , as with robinson - chaos , the definition of chaos as having an uncountable scrambled set includes cases that are generally regarded as nonchaotic .",
    "one example is a two - dimensional flow with an attracting homoclinic orbit , considered by robinson@xcite and w. ott and yorke@xcite ( see figure  1 in either paper ) ; on a trajectory converging to the homoclinic orbit , a finite piece of the trajectory forms an uncountable scrambled set .",
    "thus , the compact invariant set formed by the homoclinic orbit and its interior exhibits scrambling .    from the discussion above",
    ", we see that using notions related to the common definition of sensitive dependence presents problems when attempting to use them to give a generally applicable definition of chaos . on the other hand , another type of dynamical characterization , namely that of lyapunov exponents , seems better suited to defining chaos .",
    "indeed , it can be quite useful to define a chaotic attractor using lyapunov exponents .",
    "if one excludes certain cases of milnor attractors ( see below ) and concentrates on a definition of an attractor of a map @xmath15 as a bounded set @xmath29 with a dense orbit such that there is an @xmath34-neighborhood @xmath285 for which @xmath286 , then it seems that a good definition of a chaotic attractor of the map @xmath15 is simply an attractor that has a positive lyapunov exponent .",

    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows an example demonstrating that the definition of a chaotic attractor as an attractor with a positive lyapunov exponent can be problematic , if milnor s definition of an attractor is used .    a one - dimensional map for which the unstable fixed point at @xmath287 is a milnor attractor .",
