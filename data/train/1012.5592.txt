    "exact solutions of quantum field equations of motion provide an effective tool in studies of different phenomena of particle interactions in high energy physics .",
    "they supply with particular applications in solving problems of charged particles motion in electromagnetic fields of terrestrial experimental devices , as well as in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "exact solutions were first applied in quantum electrodynamics for development the quantum theory of the synchrotron radiation , i.e. for studies of motion and radiation of the electron in a magnetic field ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , and also for studies of the electrodynamics and weak interaction in different other configurations of external electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the furry representation @xcite in quantum electrodynamics ( for more detailed discussion on this item see @xcite ) widely used for description of particles interactions in the presence of external electromagnetic fields .",
    "recently it has been shown , that the method of exact solutions can be also applied for the problem of neutrinos and electron motion in presence of dense matter ( see @xcite for a review on this topic ) .",
    "most pronouncedly this possibility was pointed out in where the exact solution for the modified dirac equation for a neutrino moving in matter was derived and discussed in details . the corresponding exact solution for an electron moving in matter was obtained in @xcite , the problem of neutrino propagation in transversally moving matter was first solved in @xcite , and in our recent paper @xcite we considered neutrino propagation in a rotating matter accounting for the effect of nonzero neutrino mass .    here",
    "we further develop the method of exact solutions for the problem of charged leptons propagating in matter and strong magnetic fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the general form of the modified dirac equation for an electron moving in matter and magnetic field , and the corresponding spin operator is derived in section 3 . in sections 4 - 6",
    "the exact wave functions and energy spectrum are obtained .",
    "the general problem of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a given class of hamiltonians are discussed . in conclusion",
    "( section 8) we examine the exact solutions obtained in sections 2 - 6 for the particular case of the charged particle motion in a rotating neutron star with account for matter and magnetic field effects .",
    "we consider an electron propagating in nonmoving magnetized medium composed of neutrons and suppose , that magnetic field is homogeneous and constant .",
    "this can be regarded as the first approach to modelling of an electron propagation inside a neutron star .",
    "for distinctness we consider here the case of an electron , whereas generalization for other charged particles is just straightforward .",
    "we start with the modified dirac equation for the electron wave function exactly accounting for the electron interaction with matter in the absence of magnetic field ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath0 this is the most general form of the equation for the electron wave function in which the effective potential @xmath1 includes both the neutral and charged current interactions of the electron with the background particles , and which can also account for effects of matter motion and polarization .    in order to include also an effect of an external electromagnetic field , we replace in eq .",
    "( [ new ] ) the electron momentum @xmath2 by the `` extended '' momentum : @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a module of the electron charge .",
    "note , that in general case it is not a trivial task to find solutions of this equation . in what follows",
    "we consider the particular case of constant magnetic field and nonmoving uniform matter , so that for the electromagnetic field and effective matter potential we obtain @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is matter number density .",
    "we rewrite equation ( [ new1 ] ) in the hamiltonian form and get @xmath9 where @xmath10 . using the chiral representation of the @xmath11-matrices we obtain the hamiltonian in block matrix form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are pauli matrices .",
    "this form of the hamiltonian makes quite transparent the solution describing spin properties of the electron .",
    "it is obvious from ( [ bloc - diagonal hamiltonian_1 ] ) , that the longitudinal polarization operator @xmath14 @xcite , where @xmath15 are the dirac matrices , can be written in the form @xmath16 and commutes with the hamiltonian , @xmath17=0 $ ] .",
    "therefore for any of its eigenvectors the hamiltonian can be presented as the matrix : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is one of the eigenvalues of the spin operator @xmath20 .",
    "note , that the matrix ( [ matrix of hamiltonian ] ) is still @xmath21 one , and each its element is actually a product of the number by @xmath22 unit matrix . in turn",
    ", the transverse polarization operator does not commute with the hamiltonian ( [ bloc - diagonal hamiltonian_1 ] ) because of the matter term @xmath23 that breaks block symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "in order to find the electron energy spectrum @xmath24 in the matter and constant magnetic field , @xmath25 , we should solve the equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the solutions can be written in the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the `` sign '' of the energy .",
    "it is significant to note an interesting feature of the electron energy spectrum in the magnetized matter following from ( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "it is well known , that the energy spectrum of the electron in the magnetic field is degenerated in respect of spin quantum number ( each electron landau energy level in the magnetic field corresponds to both spin orientations ) .",
    "the presence of the matter ( of any non - vanishing density @xmath30 ) removes the degeneracy .",
    "this phenomenon can be attributed to the parity violation in weak interactions .",
    "let us emphasize one important relation between @xmath24 and @xmath31 that immediately follows from the spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) : @xmath32 where @xmath19 is one of the eigenvalues of the spin operator @xmath20 .",
    "we use this relation in section 7 .",
    "note that we can considerably simplify the problem of finding wave functions if take into account some obvious facts .",
    "the solution of the equation ( [ dirac equation_1 ] ) due to symmetries can be sought in the form @xmath33 substituting ( [ psi ] ) into ( [ dirac equation_1 ] ) we arrive at a system of linear equations for the electron wave function components : @xmath34 in the polar coordinates @xmath35 one obtains @xmath36 and the system of equations ( [ system1 ] ) - ( [ system4 ] ) reads now @xmath37    it is possible to show that the operator of the total momentum @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , commutes with the hamiltonian . therefore the solutions can be written in the form @xmath41 the solutions are the eigenvectors of the total momentum operator @xmath42 with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath43 .",
    "after substitution of ( [ form of solution ] ) , the system ( [ nextsystem1 ] ) - ( [ nextsystem4 ] ) turns into : @xmath44 now we define the `` increasing '' and `` decreasing '' operators @xmath45 and get the hamiltonian in the following form , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the unit matrix . note",
    "that the derived form of the hamiltonian is spectacular transparent that significantly simplify the problem of getting the explicit form of eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ dirac equation_1 ] ) . for forthcoming applications we take into consideration properties of operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the laguerre functions @xcite .",
    "the solution of system ( [ nextnextsystem1 ] ) - ( [ nextnextsystem4 ] ) ( the eigenvector of the hamiltonian ( [ matrix form of hamiltonian ] ) ) can be written in the form @xmath52    now we can get the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( the energy spectrum ) and of the spin operator @xmath19 , @xmath53 it is easy to see , that the spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) obtained above is in agreement with expressions ( [ p_0 ] ) and ( [ t^0 ] ) . from this energy spectrum , it is straightforward that the well - known energy spectrum in magnetic field ( the landau levels ) is modified by interaction of the electron with matter .",
    "however the radius of the classical orbits corresponding to a certain level ( [ p_0 ] ) does nt depend on the matter density : @xmath54 to conclude this section we would like to note , that the effect of electron trapping on circular orbits in magnetized matter exists , and this can be important for astrophysical applications .",
    "we argue in this section , that the problem considered above is a particular case of more general problem , which concludes in a retrieval of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of hamiltonians with a given general structure .",
    "the examples of these particular cases can be found in papers @xcite .",
    "taking into account the increasing interest to such hamiltonians , we expect that their profound consideration would be important for applications .    .",
    "let us take into account the following conditions :    \\1 ) @xmath55 is a hilbert space with the basis of eigenvectors @xmath56 of given quantum problem for a dirac equation ( a matter and magnetic field are included ) ;    \\2 ) in this space , the increasing and decreasing operators are determined @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are known functions that depend on the set of quantum numbers @xmath60 ;    \\3 ) the hamiltonian has one of the following explicit structures @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mass of a particle , @xmath63 is ( often a third ) component of momentum , although here we could use other symbols for demonstration the general mathematical structure .",
    "note that the theorem is also valid in other case when a certain class of replacements within the matrixes ( [ general hamiltonian structure ] ) are made , for example , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , etc .",
    "nevertheless , the disposition of operators @xmath69",
    ", @xmath70 , and zeros in the matrixes important here . note that there should be only one operator ( @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) and only one zero in any string and any column .",
    "remarkably , for any string or column the operators and zeros occupy only even or only odd positions .    in that case",
    "the following statements can be proved :    \\1 ) the eigenvector of such a hamiltonian has the following form @xmath71 and the equation for the spectrum is ( for the left structure in ( [ general hamiltonian structure ] ) ) @xmath72 the equation for the right structure in ( [ general hamiltonian structure ] ) can be written in analogous way . the spectrum can be obtained explicitly in the form @xmath73",
    "\\2 ) the spin operator ( one of the possible variants ) can be constructed from the hamiltonian .",
    "it is a matrix of operators , zeros , integrals of motion and other parameters ( @xmath62 ) . a structure of the spin operator corresponding to the hamiltonians in ( [ general hamiltonian structure ] )",
    "can take one of the following variants : @xmath74 where all free positions @xmath75 should be filled in using the main condition @xmath76=0 $ ] .",
    "of course , some refinement of structure of spin operator ( or any of its blocks ) is possible , for example , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a complex number , @xmath80 .",
    "note that the main part of known spin operators ( see , for example @xcite ) has such a structure .",
    "let us substitude the solution ( [ general solution ] ) into equation @xmath81 where @xmath82 is given by one of the explicit structures ( [ general hamiltonian structure ] ) .",
    "the homogenious system of linear equations is now obtained .",
    "the equation ( [ general equation for the spectrum ] ) is a criterion of its nonzero solution , and it is the equation for energy spectrum . to obtain the spectrum ( [ general spectrum ] ) we should solve this equation , what is trivial .",
    "let us demonstrate now that the structure ( [ general structure of spin operator ] ) of spin operator is adequate to the considered model .",
    "here we study a particular case that similar to one presented in section 3 , other cases can be solved in an analogous way .",
    "we take into consideration that the hamiltonian @xmath83 is given by structure the right - handed part of ( [ general hamiltonian structure ] ) and the spin operator we can find in the following form @xmath84 we should check the main condition @xmath76=0 $ ] .",
    "after substitution the specified expressions for @xmath83 and @xmath85 into this equation we obtain a system of linear equations for finding the coefficients @xmath86 : @xmath87 one of the solutions can be taken in the form @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and the corresponding spin operator can be presented as follows @xmath91 we see that obtained spin operator is similar to one used in section 3 .",
    "_ remark 1 .",
    "_ the symmetry of the hamiltonian can be violated as described in sections 1 - 4 . there",
    "we deal with the hamiltonian that differs from ( [ general hamiltonian structure ] , right ) by the term @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is a constant . in that case",
    ", the spin operator can be constructed in the form @xmath94 and the spectrum depends on spin quantum number similar to eq .",
    "( [ p_0 ] ) .",
    "note that the spin operator ( [ matrix form of spin operator ] ) is similar to that in eq .",
    "( [ structure of block spin operator ] ) .    _",
    "_ the theorem can be generalized to the hamiltonians of more complicated structures namely @xmath95 the equation for the spectrum for this model ( e.g. , for the left side of eq .",
    "( [ general hamiltonian structure ] ) ) is @xmath96 however , to solve this equation is not a simple task .    _",
    "_ it is not obvious from the matrix form of the hamiltonian ( [ matrix form of hamiltonian ] ) , that it is a self - conjugate operator . to prove this ,",
    "the properties of `` increasing '' and `` decreasing '' operators should be considered more carefully .",
    "a sequenced collection of functions @xmath97 constitute a basis in the hilbert space with scalar product defined as @xmath98 so that , we get for each @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xmath101 hence for operators ( [ increasing and decreasing operators ] ) we obtain @xmath102 and @xmath103 , where symbol @xmath104 implies hermitian conjugation of operators . from the matrix form of the hamiltonian ( [ matrix form of hamiltonian ] ) we see that @xmath105 . so that we can use the theorem for this case .",
    "note that the increasing and decreasing operators can be used effectively in this problem because we need in only one basis @xmath51 for constructing the spinor ( [ solution ] ) . in more complicated models ,",
    "we seem should take two or even more different basis functions for constructing a solution .",
    "we go back now to the hamiltonian ( [ matrix of hamiltonian ] ) . in order to find its eigenvectors , we consider the following chain of transformations @xmath106 @xmath107 hence , we obtain @xmath108 in the same way we obtain the following expressions for @xmath109 and @xmath110 : @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath93 are new constants .    getting of the relation between @xmath113 and @xmath109 ( and between @xmath114 and @xmath110 )",
    "is similar .",
    "namely , we should use the equations @xmath115 we finally get @xmath116 with the only coefficient @xmath117 which has to be defined from the normalization condition @xmath118 .",
    "we obtain @xmath119 .",
    "finally , we obtain the wave function : @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 is a normalizing factor .",
    "equations ( [ exact solution])-([coefficients 2 ] ) represent the exact solution of ( [ dirac equation_1 ] ) with the hamiltonian ( [ bloc - diagonal hamiltonian_1 ] ) that describes the electron moving in matter and magnetic field . note that in the case @xmath123 , these formulas are reduced to well - known solutions for the electron wave functions in a constant homogeneous magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out , that the obtained exact solution for the electron motion in matter and magnetic field can be used as the first approximation of description of particles moving in an external environment of more complicated configuration . as an example , we demonstrate how the problem of an electron ( or another charged particle ) motion in a rotating matter with magnetic field can be solved .",
    "this problem is of interest in different astrophysical contexts .",
    "if the angular velocity @xmath124 is small compare to the magnetic field , we can calculate the spectrum using a standard perturbation theory with the small parameter @xmath125 . if , for example , we choose for the matter density , angular velocity and magnetic field the values peculiar for a rotating neutron star ( @xmath126 ) , then the parameter is really small , @xmath127 now we can take the spectrum and wave functions found above ( i.e. , without rotation ) as the lowest order of perturbation series and find the correction term .",
    "we consider the particular case of constant magnetic field and rotating uniform matter so that the electromagnetic field and effective matter potential are given by @xmath128 where @xmath7 .",
