    "nowadays continuous - variable entanglement can be generated in several different degrees of freedom ( dofs ) .",
    "for example , one has entangled the polarization @xcite , spatial @xcite or quadrature @xcite electric field variables respectively . however",
    ", continuous - variable entanglement between different dofs , or so - called `` hybrid entanglement '' , is a yet widely unexplored field .",
    "this is contrary to the field of discrete - variables , where entanglement between dofs has been subject to many investigations and has been successfully demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown that one can generate continuous - variable hybrid entanglement by quadrature squeezing cylindrically polarized modes @xcite .",
    "these states extend the application spectrum of continuous - variable entangled systems and could be in particular useful for the generation of cluster states which are of great importance in quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the entanglement between the different dofs in quadrature squeezed cylindrically polarized modes is based on a classical `` structural inseparability '' of the polarization and spatial field variables @xcite . in other words , already in a classical picture these modes can not be described as a product state of the polarization and spatial dof @xcite .        in this paper",
    "we provide the tools necessary to characterize the hybrid entanglement present in quadrature squeezed cylindrically polarized modes . in the first part",
    ", we demonstrate the experimental realization of amplitude squeezing in radially and azimuthally polarized beams .",
    "these nonclassical states of light form the backbone for the generation of hybrid entanglement with cylindrically polarized modes . in the second part",
    ", we present the measurement schemes to observe polarization , spatial and hybrid entanglement .",
    "theoretically we carefully characterize the entanglement contained between the different dofs and show how the quantum correlations depend on the chosen measurement scheme .",
    "a main problem of generating quadrature squeezing in cylindrically polarized modes , i.e. modes with a complex spatial as well as a complex polarization pattern , is that many nonlinear media only interact with only one fixed polarization or an inappropriate spatial mode . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that a specially tailored nanobore photonic crystal fiber is one of the few nonlinear media which can directly squeeze cylindrically polarized modes . here",
    "we take a different approach .",
    "we first amplitude squeeze a linearly polarized mode with a gaussian intensity profile and afterwards mode convert it into a cylindrically polarized mode of our choice .",
    "this scheme has the advantage that squeezing with gaussian modes is a well established method as well as that the mode transformation allows a wider choice of cylindrically polarized modes to be generated as one is not fixed to the modes supported by the nonlinear medium .",
    "our experimental scheme is depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "an asymmetric sagnac interferometer @xcite generates an amplitude squeezed linearly polarized gaussian mode .",
    "the sagnac loop consists of a 93:7 beam splitter and a @xmath1 long polarization maintaining single - mode fiber ( 3 m fs - pm-7811 ) .",
    "a shot - noise limited laser ( origami , onefive gmbh ) centered at a wavelength of @xmath2 nm and emitting 220fs pulses acts as a light source .",
    "the quantum noise fluctuations of the light beam exiting the sagnac interferometer are observed with a single detector at a sideband frequency of @xmath3mhz .",
    "the coherent output beam of the laser is used to calibrate to the shot - noise level . with this method",
    "a total of @xmath4 of amplitude squeezing has been measured in the gaussian mode .    in the next step",
    ", the amplitude squeezed gaussian mode is sent through a liquid - crystal polarization converter ( arcoptix ) .",
    "this mode transformer is capable of converting linearly polarized gaussian modes into modes with either a continuous azimuthally or radially polarized polarization distribution .",
    "the generated modes are depicted in fig .",
    "[ modes ] . after the mode converter @xmath0 are observed in both the azimuthally and radially polarized mode .",
    "the results are shown in fig  [ sqdata ] .",
    "there are two main reasons why there is less amplitude squeezing contained in the cylindrically polarized modes than in the gaussian mode : 1 .",
    "the mode transformation is not performed with unit efficiency but losses of about @xmath5 occur during the conversion process .",
    "2 . the mode converter is not anti - reflection coated for 1560 nm , thus leading to losses of nearly @xmath5 due to reflection .",
    "this means that in future the squeezing in cylindrically polarized modes can be significantly increased by improving the mode converter devices .",
    "the presented results show that the generation of efficient squeezing in different cylindrically polarized modes , namely the azimuthally and radially polarized modes , is feasible .",
    "this clearly increases the application spectrum of these modes in the wide field of quantum optics .",
    "cylindrically polarized modes can be described with the help of horizontally ( @xmath6 ) or vertically ( @xmath7 ) polarized first - order hermite - gauss modes ( ( @xmath8 ) and ( @xmath9 ) ) associated to the annihilation operators @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the azimuthally and radially polarized modes are then given by the following annihilation operators @xcite : @xmath14 in this section we quantify the entanglement generated inside these modes when they are quadrature squeezed .",
    "furthermore , we present the experimental schemes with which one can detect the entanglement between the different dofs",
    ". we will consider in detail the exemplary case of a bright quadrature squeezed azimuthally polarized mode as this is one of the states we can generate experimentally .",
    "however , it should be noted that the results here derived are valid for all cylindrically polarized modes and also apply to vacuum states .    a bright quadrature squeezed azimuthally polarized mode can be written as @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the single - mode squeezing operator , and @xmath17 the displacement operator with @xmath18 being the displacement of the azimuthally polarized mode .",
    "the value @xmath19 quantifies the squeezing with @xmath20 being the degree of squeezing and @xmath21 the squeezing angle .",
    "the two - mode squeezing operator @xmath22 describes the entanglement existing between the orthogonally polarized hermite - gaussian modes . in order to quantify this entanglement",
    "an appropriate measure is required .",
    "a prominent one is the simon - duan inseparability criterion @xcite which can be extended to the stokes operators for a bipartite system @xmath23 @xcite :        @xmath24    where @xmath25 are the quantum stokes operators corresponding to the classical stokes parameters @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , or @xmath28 are the three combinations of the stokes operators and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the possible combinations of the spatial @xmath33 or polarization @xmath34 stokes measurements on the two orthogonally polarized hermite - gaussian basis modes , one of which is in subsystem @xmath35 the other in subsystem @xmath36 . here @xmath37 is the variance of the operator @xmath38 normalized to @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the covariance of the two stokes operators . depending on",
    "which violation occurs , either polarization , spatial or hybrid entanglement exists .    in the following",
    ", we will theoretically derive how polarization entanglement can be observed .",
    "the modifications needed in order to observe spatial and hybrid entanglement are minor and are presented at the end of this section .    to observe the quantum correlations contained within the azimuthally polarized mode , the two orthogonally polarized hermite - gaussian modes of the quadrature squee - zed azimuthally polarized beam need to be spatially separated into two arms @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this can , for example , be performed with a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hybridmeas ] . the state is then given by : @xmath41        in order to access the polarization entanglement , each mode , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , is superimposed with a coherent beam with the same spatial mode but orthogonal polarization , namely @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these have the amplitudes @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "experimentally this can be performed by placing a pbs in each arm and inserting the coherent states in the second input ports of these as shown in fig .",
    "[ hybridmeas ] .",

    "this proves that polarization entanglement between the two arms , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , is present .",

    "spatial entanglement can be shown in a very similar manner . in order to observe this , the two modes , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , from the squeezed azimuthally polarized mode have to be interfered with two coherent beams with the same polarization but orthogonal first - order hermite - gaussian modes , namely @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "it is straightforward to see that the violations shown in eq.([violationpol1 ] ) and eq.([violationpol2 ] ) of the duan - simon criterion are valid for any combination of the stokes operators made on each arm , thus proving that hybrid entanglement is also present .    a scheme to observe hybrid entanglement",
