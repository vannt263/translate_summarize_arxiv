    "<S> is even an exact ground state  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the success of laughlin s theory of the fqhe fractions @xmath1 , based on  , depends crucially on the fact that the laughlin wave function behaves as an incompressible liquid , whose response to perturbations and external fields is extremely rigid . </S>",
    "<S> this in fact has two distinct aspects :    * 1 . *  </S>",
    "<S> the laughlin wave function is an approximate ground state for the many - body hamiltonian , and its energy is separated from the rest of the spectrum by a gap .    </S>",
    "<S> * 2 . </S>",
    "<S> *  modifications of the laughlin wave function that stay within the ground eigenspace of the many - body hamiltonian can not increase the local one - particle density beyond a fixed value .    </S>",
    "<S> the main evidence for these facts is experimental and numerical . </S>",
    "<S> for model zero - range interactions , the justification of property * 1 * amounts to a proof of an @xmath0-independent spectral gap , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * section  2.2 ) or  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * section  2.1 ) and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> we are not aware of a solution to this important problem .    </S>",
    "<S> property * 2 * is not always recognized as a separate issue , but is also crucial for laughlin s original argument supporting quantization of the hall conductivity  @xcite and for fqhe physics in general . </S>",
    "<S> its importance lies in understanding the effect of an external potential that would try to concentrate the density as much as possible in energetically favorable places .    </S>",
    "<S> if the energy gap in property * 1 * is sufficiently large we can exclude a jump across it and restrict attention to wave functions with the same interaction energy as the laughlin function . </S>",

    "<S> this form exhausts the class of functions that minimize the magnetic kinetic energy and at the same time avoid repulsive interactions by vanishing at least as @xmath17 as @xmath16 and @xmath18 come together . in the bosonic case and with @xmath19 these are exactly the ground states of the contact interaction  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * section  2.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we shall refer to the class of states of the form as _ fully correlated states_.    physically ,   can lead to the addition of quasi - holes ( zeros of the wave - function ) to the laughlin state , essentially arbitrary correlations between the particles and quasi - holes locations being allowed . </S>",
    "<S> it is intuitive that this leads to a decrease of the _ global _ density . </S>",
    "<S> it is however far from obvious that no _ local _ increase of the density can occur anywhere . </S>",
    "<S> several quasi - holes arranged tightly on a circle could , perhaps , increase the density inside the circle . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath15 need not contain any zeros at all like , e.g. , @xmath20 , which stretches the support of the density in one direction and shrinks it in another .    in this letter , we report on recent density bounds for fully correlated states that demonstrate the validity of property * 2 * without invoking property * 1*. they hold essentially on length scales @xmath21 , much smaller than the full extent of the liquid , which is of order @xmath22 , and are related to earlier partial results proved in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the full proofs are somewhat involved and shall be presented elsewhere  @xcite but we sketch the main arguments below , and discuss physical applications .    in his pioneering paper  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> laughlin already argued that the one - particle density of the state has the form of a circular droplet of radius @xmath23 where the density takes the constant value @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the argument was based on the plasma analogy , where the absolute square of the wave function is written as the gibbs distribution of a classical 2d coulomb gas , and subsequently treated by a mean - field approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> recent mathematical analysis has confirmed the validity of this approximation for the laughlin states and extended it to more general states of the form  , including laughlin s quasi hole states where the prefactor @xmath15 is a product where each factor depends on a single variable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis was generalized to other prefactors of a special kind in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a common feature that emerged was an upper bound on the one - particle density of magnitude @xmath24 , which is the density of the laughlin state itself . </S>",
    "<S> such a bound was called an _ incompressibility estimate _ in @xcite because it is a manifestation of the resistance of the laughlin state against attempts to compress its density . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field methods of @xcite are not applicable to general prefactors @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the question of a bound on the density for the general case was treated in  @xcite with an entirely different technique , rooted in 2d potential theory . </S>",
    "<S> the bound obtained was , however , four times the expected optimal value @xmath24 . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that an improved version of the potential theoretic method leads to the correct optimal bound for _ arbitrary _  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> as indicated by numerical studies  @xcite , the incompressibility bound for the density can not be expected to hold pointwise for finite @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we prove , however , that it holds for local averages . </S>",
    "<S> denote @xmath25 the particle density of the state  . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is    [ main thm0 ] for any @xmath26 and any disk @xmath27 of radius @xmath28 we have @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the area of the disk and @xmath31 tends to zero as @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> recall that the magnetic length is @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the average can thus be taken on `` mesoscopic scales '' , much smaller than the full extent of the state , @xmath33 , but not quite down to the expected finest scale , @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> a simple argument shows that   implies the analogous result for any open set , not just a disk .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows that , for a continuous confining potential @xmath35 , the smallest potential energy obtainable with a fully correlated state @xmath36 is bounded below by @xmath0 times the `` bathtub energy ''  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem  1.14 ) @xmath37 i.e. the minimum of the potential energy over all densities @xmath38 bounded by @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this lower bound @xmath39 holds for large @xmath0 provided @xmath35 varies only on scales much larger than @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> the bound means that any compression of the particle density above the `` magic value '' @xmath41 that one could imagine to accommodate the variations of an external potential would make us leave the class of fully correlated states , with corresponding increase in either the magnetic kinetic energy or the interaction energy . assuming the spectral gap mentioned in property  * 1 * , no such density bump is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> this justifies two things _ a posteriori _ :    @xmath42 that it is legitimate to neglect disorder in the sample and/or small external electric fields , as is done as a first approximation in the derivation of fqhe wave - functions .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 laughlin s argument  @xcite ( see also  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * sections 4.4 , 9.3 and 9.5 ) ) that switching on an electric current moves electrons transversally without creating any charge accumulation , and generates a hall conductivity of value  @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been proposed ( see  @xcite for reviews ) that laughlin wave functions could be created in cold atomic gases , either by rapid rotation or by applying artificial magnetic fields . in this context , a magneto - optical trap confines the gas . </S>",
    "<S> some recent proposals to reach the laughlin state  @xcite involve some non - trivial engineering of the trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> how the laughlin state responds is , therefore , of importance for the experimental set - up .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the precursor of fqhe states in a rapidly rotating bose gas is a bose - einstein condensate ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . observing the distinctively flat profile of the laughlin state would already be a strong indication of the transition to the fqhe regime . </S>",
    "<S> a more complete probe could be the response of the gas to variations of the trapping potential : the bose condensate follows the trap by taking a thomas - fermi - like shape ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> the laughlin state essentially does not respond to such variations , as exemplified by our main theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that a combination of theorem  [ main thm0 ] with estimates obtained in  @xcite leads to the following improvement of  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * corollary  2.3 ) :    [ cor : radial ] let @xmath43 with @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> then the potential energy within the class   is minimized by the laughlin state ( @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined in   and   respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the laughlin state stays an approximate minimizer in any power - law trap ( the result actually holds for more general radial increasing potentials ) . </S>",
    "<S> no matter how steep and narrow a potential well one imposes , it is impossible to compress the laughlin state while keeping the form  , i.e. , without jumping across the spectral gap . </S>",
    "<S> extensions of corollary  [ cor : radial ] to mexican - hat - like traps as in  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * corollary  2.3 ) are also possible .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to sketching the proof of theorem  [ main thm0 ] , postponing the details to a planned longer paper . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to change variables and consider the scaled @xmath0-particle probability density @xmath49 corresponding to the wave - function  . </S>",
    "<S> this has an extension @xmath34 for the laughlin state , @xmath50 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 stands for @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the scaled 1-particle probability density is @xmath53 the first step is to write the @xmath0-particle density as a gibbs factor ( laughlin s plasma analogy ) , @xmath54 with effective `` temperature '' @xmath55 and the hamiltonian @xmath56 where @xmath57 the term @xmath58 has the important property of being superharmonic in each variable : @xmath59 this holds because @xmath15 is analytic and is , in fact , the only property of @xmath60 that is used in our method . </S>",
    "<S> a precursor of the desired bound for @xmath61 is the fact that the local density of points in a minimizing configuration for @xmath62 is everywhere bounded above by @xmath63 for large @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the core of the proof of the theorem , and a signature of screening properties of the effective plasma . to establish it , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce and study an auxiliary minimization problem , which is , mathematically , a cousin of the thomas - fermi energy minimization problem for molecules  @xcite .    for @xmath64 fixed points @xmath65 ( nuclei ) </S>",
    "<S> we define an energy for functions @xmath66 on @xmath6 ( electron density ) by @xmath67=-\\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^2 } v_{\\rm nucl } ( x)\\sigma(x)\\,dx + d(\\sigma , \\sigma)\\ ] ] with @xmath68 and @xmath69 this functional is minimized under the subsidiary conditions @xmath70 in physical terms , this model describes a neutral 2d molecule consisting of fixed nuclei and mobile electrons , with coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of the constraint @xmath71 is that the kinetic energy of the electrons is zero for densities @xmath72 and @xmath73 for densities  @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic facts about this tf model are : ( 1 ) there exists a unique minimizer , @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the minimizer has compact support . ( 3 ) apart of a set of measure zero , @xmath75 takes only the values 0 or 1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) the thomas - fermi equation holds : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the total electrostatic potential of the molecule . according to the tf equation </S>",
    "<S> the support of @xmath78 is the same as the support of the potential @xmath79 which is continuous away from the `` nuclei '' . </S>",
    "<S> denote by @xmath80 the open set where @xmath81 is strictly larger than @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> some important properties are :    \\(1 ) the area of @xmath80 is equal to @xmath64 . ( 2 ) @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) for a single nucleus at @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the disc with center @xmath84 and radius @xmath86 .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now a scaled version of , @xmath87 with @xmath88 symmetric and superharmonic in each variable @xmath65 and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> a key property of minimizing configurations of @xmath90 is stated in the following :    [ lem : excl ] let @xmath91 be a minimizing configuration of points for @xmath90 . for any subset of points </S>",
    "<S> @xmath92 , @xmath93    the proof of this intermediary result is sketched in the appendix . to make the result plausible , observe the following : the first term in   is the electrostatic potential generated by a constant background of charge density @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> using equation  , the electrostatic potential generated by the points @xmath95 is completely screened by the part of the background potential generated by the region @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> what the result says is that no other point of a minimizing configuration can lie inside this screening region . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is two - fold :    @xmath42 if another point @xmath97 lay inside the screening region , one could decrease the sum of the first two terms in   by moving @xmath97 to any position on the boundary .    @xmath42 the last term @xmath88 in  , being superharmonic , is generated by a positive charge distribution . </S>",
    "<S> one can thus always decrease @xmath98 by moving @xmath97 to some point on the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> such a move decreases at the same time the sum of the first two terms .    </S>",
    "<S> the particular case @xmath99 of lemma  [ lem : excl ] goes back to an unpublished theorem of lieb , used in @xcite : the minimal distance between points in a minimizing configuration of @xmath90 is not less than @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> this property shows that the density of points is in any case bounded above by @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the general exclusion rule for all @xmath64 implies more . </S>",
    "<S> the density is , in fact , asymptotically bounded above by @xmath102 :    [ lem : excl to dens ] for @xmath103 let @xmath104 denote the maximum number of any points @xmath105 that a disk @xmath106 of radius @xmath107 can accommodate while respecting the exclusion rule  . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath108    we present a proof sketch in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> the main point is that , if a large region contains a density of points @xmath74 we can reach a contradiction by considering two facts :    @xmath42 the potential @xmath81 generated by the points @xmath109 contained in @xmath106 and the corresponding exclusion set @xmath110 must vanish at all the points @xmath111 lying outside of @xmath106 , by the exclusion rule and  . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a uniform upper bound on @xmath81 outside of @xmath106 .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 the same potential is generated by an overall positive charge density , because the nuclear charge in @xmath106 , which is @xmath112 by assumption , is not fully screened by the part of the negative charge density @xmath75 lying in @xmath106 , at most equal to the area @xmath113 because @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> a lower bound on the circular average of @xmath81 outside of @xmath106 follows .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that , for @xmath107 large enough , the two estimates obtained in this way contradict one another .    after scaling </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath115 , lemma 2 applies to the hamiltonian and implies that in any minimizing configuration @xmath116 of   the number of points @xmath117 contained in any disc of radius @xmath118 is no larger than @xmath63 times the area of the disc . </S>",
    "<S> this is the gist of the proof . </S>",
    "<S> from there , two main steps are left to conclude the proof of theorem  [ main thm0 ] , see the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> we point out that our density upper bound holds down to the finest possible scale for ground states of the plasma hamiltonian  , i.e. on length scales @xmath119 ( see  @xcite where the corresponding lower bound is proved in the purely coulombic case @xmath120 ) . </S>",
    "<S> when applying this result to gibbs states of   we have to restrict to length scales @xmath121 , but this is likely to be due to a technical limitation of our method . </S>",
    "<S> it was indeed recently proved that , for the purely coulombic hamiltonian , the expected microscopic density estimate holds for low temperature gibbs states  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for ground states of higher dimensional coulomb and riesz gases ) . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be seen whether a combination of our methods with those of  @xcite could improve our results . </S>",
