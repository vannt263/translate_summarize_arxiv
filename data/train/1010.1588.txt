    "one of the more surprising results of the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) was the egret discovery of an 18 gev photon associated with grb 940217 ( hurley 1994 ) .",
    "about a half - dozen bursts were seen over the course of the cgro mission with photons above 100 mev ( catelli 1998 , dingus 2003 ) .",
    "since the grb spectral energy distribution at lower energies has been well characterized by a modified power law with peak fluxes at energies of the order of 200 kev , the existence of photons at energies @xmath4 times higher puts a significant constraint on any viable model of the grb phenomenon .",
    "this has been a subject of great interest for missions that followed egret . prior to launch of the fermi gamma - ray space telescope , it was possible to speculate that the lat instrument would detect more than 200 grb events per year ( dingus , 2003 ) . in the two year period since the launch of the fermi gamma - ray space telescope , the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm )",
    "has reported approximately 475 grbs , ie",
    ". a rate of about 250 per year . over essentially the same period ,",
    "only 17 bursts have been identified by the fermi / lat .",
    "we now see that the range of grb photon energies extends over a scale of @xmath5 but the physical dynamics of these phenomena are still not understood .",
    "this is coupled to the question of whether high energy photons are associated with all grbs or only with a small sub - class .",
    "since the fermi mission is unlikely to be duplicated any time soon , there is some urgency to assuring that the maximum information is being extracted from this valuable facility .",
    "thus , our group has set about developing techniques for enlarging the number of gamma - ray bursts identified with high energy photon emission , ie . above 100 mev .",
    "the first result of this effort has established the correlation of two @xmath6/xrt - localized bursts , grb 080905a and grb 091208b , with high energy photons in the @xmath3/lat detector ( akerlof el al .",
    "( 2010 ) , hereafter a10 ) .",
    "the statistical technique employed is the @xmath7 method , most familiar to those detecting signals in the time domain .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the characteristics of both the signal and background are @xmath8 known functions of one or more variables .",
    "since the matched filter maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio , moderate departures from optimality degrade the filter performance relatively slowly , making this a valuable tool for investigating the possible existence of faint signals .",
    "the details of the filter algorithm are explicitly described in a10 . in this paper",
    ", we take the next harder step of dropping our reliance on precision burst coordinates provided by swift or other similar high resolution instruments .",
    "instead , we use the approximate localization of the @xmath3/gbm to map a region of interest on the @xmath3/lat field of view . by identifying high energy photon clusters",
    ", provisional burst coordinates can be determined with significantly smaller errors than available from the gbm .",
    "from there , the burst identification follows along lines set out in a10 .",
    "as a first step in this program , a list of all gbm triggers was obtained from the @xmath9 catalog maintained by the @xmath3 science support center .",
    "the catalog contains 497 grb triggers from launch to july 9 , 2010 .",
    "this list was cross - matched with table 1 in guetta & pian ( 2009 ) and table 2 in guetta et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to identify the burst gcn designations and the low energy fluences . for triggers occuring after february 18 , 2010",
    ", fluences were obtained from individual gcn circulars .",
    "gbm triggers were also checked against xrt locations from @xmath6table/ ] to remove events already considered in a10 .",
    "using data from the fermi spacecraft attitude file , we further selected those triggers with a boresight angle less than 52@xmath10 and an estimated gbm error circle less than 10@xmath10 .",
    "events without gbm fluence information or previously claimed lat detectionstable/ ] were also discarded . applying a final cut on gbm fluence ( 8 - 1000 kev ) requiring greater than 5.0",
    "@xmath1erg/@xmath2 reduced the number to 22 events ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these are termed the `` gbm '' data .",
    "464 additional fields were taken at random on the sky with similar criteria to study the background behavior and are identified as the``random '' data in the following text .",

    "the core task of this search procedure is the identification of triplet clusters of photons in the @xmath3/lat instrument whose spatial accuracy is considerably better than the gbm .",
    "the set of photon data for each candidate burst is confined to lie within a @xmath11 cone angle of the gbm direction and a time window extending from zero to 47.5 s after the gbm burst trigger .",
    "the procedure first computes a signal weight for each photon pair based on photon energy , detection time , photon event class and angular separation relative to the expected lat psf errors .",
    "the photon pair weights are subject to a weak threshold cut designed to avoid combinatorial overload should large photon numbers be encountered . in practice , this was not a severe problem and can be ignored .",
    "the formula for the pair weights is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the angle between the @xmath17th and @xmath18th photon .",
    "the definitions of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be found in equation 1,3 and 4 of a10 .",
    "the next step is to link photon pairs so that the three pairs , \\{i , j } , \\{j , k } and \\{i , k } , become identified as the triplet , \\{i , j , k}. the triplet weight value is computed by the formula : @xmath22    the triplet weights are ranked by value and the set is pruned by the condition that a triplet element , @xmath23 , is removed if @xmath24 .",
    "this leaves a set of triplet clusters , each with a discrete complement of three photons . for each of these clusters , a psf - weighted estimate of the burst direction is performed and the matched filter angle weight , @xmath25 is computed with respect to this vector as described in equation 2 of a10 . at this point ,",
    "an event weight for each cluster is computed by the formulas given in a10 with one small modification . in the scheme described here ,",
    "the grb direction is not initially defined with any precision .",
    "thus , it is inappropriate to include a @xmath26 factor for all values of @xmath19 . for the highest energy photon in each triplet ,",
    "the @xmath27 factor is removed to reflect that this leading photon plays the principal role in fixing the apparent grb direction .",
    "although the calculations carry each cluster through the same computational path , the expectation is that the cluster with the highest matched filter weight is the most probable identification .",
    "the 22 gbm fields described earlier were the target of this investigation .",
    "we recognized that the most convincing argument for a true lat identification should rely on the statistical distributions for the matched filter weights in lat fields with similar characteristics . to increase that number as much as possible , the lat fields of view were segmented into 12 circular tiles embedded on a spherical surface .",
    "each tile subtends a cone with a half - angle of 16.0@xmath10 .",
    "this tiling scheme was applied to both the gbm and random field data sets to realize 182 and 3440 independent directions in space satisfying all the criteria described previously .",
    "taking advantage of the fact that each field observation was blocked into a 250-s segment , the number of independent observations was multiplied by five by regarding each 50-s time slice as a separate sample .",
    "thus , there are 910 background measurements taken from lat observations obtained simultaneously with the candidate gbm fields and an additional 17200 samples taken under similar but not identical conditions . one particular concern for an analysis of this type is that false positives will selectively occur as the sample photon rate rises substantially above the mean . evidence that this is not the case here is shown in figure 1 which plots the cumulative distribution of the total number of photons within the lat field of view over a 250-s interval .",
    "these rates explicitly exclude contamination from photons beyond the 105@xmath10 zenith angle cut .",
    "as shown in the plot , the prominent gbm trigger event reported here is not associated specifically with fields with high ambient background rates .",
    "the similarity of the distributions for gbm and random fields also shows that the gbm data are not pathological as far as rates are concerned .",
    "zenith angle cut .",
    "the rate corresponding to the most prominent gbm event is indicated by the arrow . ]",
    "our statistical localization and weighting scheme identified one outstanding candidate for high energy photon emission , grb 090228a .",
    "the best estimate for the probability of such an occurence by chance alone was obtained by performing identical searches on random lat fields with the same criteria .",
    "thus , 11 out of 17200 random fields generated matched filter weights exceeding the value for our candidate event .",
    "multiplying by a trials factor of 22 for the number of gbm localized fields considered yields a false positive probability of 1.4% . to check that these correlations were simply not due to preferentially higher background rates for the gbm exposures , we also performed similar calculations for the lat data confined to an average of 8 uncorrelated directions per exposure and five independent time intervals from the same gbm data sets . in this case , 2 fields out of 910 exceed the candidate signal for a false positive rate of 4.8% .",
    "the cumulative distributions are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the statistical similarity of the gbm off - axis and random field data demonstrates that the gbm data set is not correlated with anomalous environmental conditions such as higher cosmic ray background rates .",
    "a list of photons associated with this burst is provided in table 2 .",
    "the gbm data for grb 090228a is described in gcn 8918 ( von kienlin , et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "according to this note , the burst was localized to a @xmath28 accuracy of better than @xmath29 with an additional systematic uncertainty of the order of @xmath30 .",
    "the coordinate values obtained by the gbm group and this analysis are listed in table 2 .",
    "the gbm value generated some concern since our cluster finder position disagreed by 8.7@xmath10 .",
    "fortuitously as this manuscript was being drafted , a paper was posted to astro - ph ( guiriec et al . ,",
    "2010 ) providing a burst direction with an estimated accuracy of @xmath31 and lying @xmath32 from our own estimate .",
    "we believe that this establishes the validity of our identification to near certainty .",
    "in addition , the positive grb correlation of event class 2 and 3 photon rates discussed in a10 was observed for the ensemble of gbm fields as well .",
