    "with the `` table - top '' laser systems , nowadays available , laser pulse peak field strengths much greater than the binding field of the outer atomic electrons can be achieved ( see e.g.  @xcite for an overview ) . above a certain threshold electric field",
    "the electron is able to escape even classically from the atomic nucleus , i.e. , without tunneling through the barrier formed by the coulomb potential and the external electric ( laser ) field .",

    "are expected . in particular ,",
    "ionization at such high field strengths occurs mainly within a few half laser cycles , i.e. , on a sub - femtosecond time scale , provided that the pulse rises fast enough so that tunneling contributes negligibly to the overall ionization .",
    "fast depletion of bound states within one half laser cycle leads to a non - isotropic electron distribution .",

    "are shown . in each case",
    "three different phases ( @xmath43 ) were chosen in order to check how strong ionization depends on phase effects .",
    "the frequency was @xmath44 in these runs .    during the course of one half cycle ionization",
    "is strongly phase dependent . in the @xmath45-cases ionization is particularly strong in the beginning owing to the abrupt turn - on of the field , while in the @xmath46-cases ionization starts smoothly .",
    "a steady state - rate , based on cycle - averaging , of course can not resolve such details .    for @xmath41",
    "ionization lasts mainly two half cycles while for @xmath47 already after one single half cycle ionization is @xmath48 98% .",
    "the more rapid ionization is , the stronger should be the dependence of ionization on the phase @xmath28 .",
    "however , even in the @xmath47-case the two fields @xmath46 and @xmath45 lead to the same net ionization _",
    "after one half cycle_. only if one is interested in the ionization dynamics on time scales below one optical half cycle ionization becomes phase - sensitive .",
    "however , even the shortest pulses nowadays available have to cross the field strength region where the ionization rate is @xmath49 .",
    "once this regime is passed there is not much electron density left to be ionized by the stronger part of the pulse .    for the sake of illustration the probability density after one complete optical cycle in the @xmath50-case",
    "is shown in figure [ fig_four ] .",
    "owing to rescattering of probability density at the ionic core wave - packets have already built up .",
    "closer examination yields that subsequent wave packets in position space can be mapped to subsequent wave packets in momentum space .",

    "the 12-cycle @xmath41-pulse ( drawn solid ) ionizes most slowly , but the 6-cycle @xmath41-pulse ( dotted ) deplets quicker the ground state than it is the case for the 12 cycle @xmath47-case ( dashed ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the bsi regime is reached earlier for the weaker but shorter @xmath41-pulse .",
    "the low frequency pulse ( thin solid line ) causes more rapid ionization than its counterpart with twice the frequency since the total time where the bsi region is reached ( measured in _",

    "we will further discuss the ground state populations depicted in figure [ fig_five ] in section [ disc ] when we reproduce them with an empirical formula .      in ref .",
    "@xcite one of the authors ( d.b . ) dealt extensively with @xmath61-pulses of the form e(t)=^2 ( t ) t , t = n .",
    "since the results look very similar to those in the gaussian case we suppress a further discussion here .",
    "however , in section [ disc ] we utilize rates numerically determined in @xcite for @xmath61-pulses in order to confirm the insensitivity of our proposed rate formula with respect to the pulse shape .",
    "furthermore , a different numerical scheme was used in @xcite .",
    "this gives additional reliability to the numerical results which will be utilized to derive an empirical bsi rate in the following section .",
    "in this section we want to demonstrate that it is possible to reproduce our numerical results using a simple formula for the ionization rate in the bsi regime .",
    "this rate is not sensitive to laser frequency and pulse shape in a wide parameter range .",
    "moreover we show that none of the analytical rates stated in subsection [ ionirates ] is applicable to bsi .    since bsi occurs mainly during one or two half laser periods a cycle - averaged rate obviously makes no sense .",
    "therefore the laser field @xmath26 with its entire time - dependence has to be plugged in a rate formula , i.e. , @xmath62 $ ] , while in tunneling ionization a rate which depends on the pulse envelope only , @xmath63 $ ] , is sufficient .",
    "we determined _ instantaneous _ ionization rates from the decreasing ground state populations , in accordance with eq .  .",
    "in figure [ ratescomp ] the results are plotted vs the electric field present at the corresponding instant .",
    "usually the deepest descent in the ground state population is in the vicinity of the electric field maximum of the actual half cycle .",
    "however , this behavior might be disturbed by `` backsweeping '' probability density ionized earlier , especially for high frequencies ( frequencies not much less than @xmath64 ) since the excursion length of a freely oscillating electron is then not much larger than the width of its wave - packet representation .    in figure [ ratescomp ]",
    "different symbols are used for different pulse shapes , pulse lengths , and laser frequencies . for comparison the predictions by the analytic formulas of subsection [ ionirates ]",
    "are drawn as well .",
    "the scattering of the numerical data is due to the fact that instantaneous rates for a certain electric field value may stem from runs with different pulse shapes , peak field strengths or laser frequencies .    the bsi regime for atomic hydrogen sets in for @xmath65 when a classical electron , initially on an @xmath66 orbit , can escape from the atomic core . in general this",
    "so - called _ critical field _ in the case of hydrogen - like ions is given by @xcite = ( + 1 ) _ 0 ^ 3/2 .",
    "once the critical field is reached one expects rapid ionization within a few half cycles .",
    "therefore we are especially interested in the region where @xmath67 .",
    "fortunately , the scattering of our numerical data is small in this region of field strengths .",
    "this makes possible our goal to provide a bsi rate formula valid for a wide range of pulse shapes and laser frequencies .",
    "we observe that none of the analytical theories under consideration predicts the bsi rates correctly .",
    "apart from keldysh s result all formulas overestimate the ionization rate in the region of interest , @xmath68",
    ". the ionization rate for much higher field strengths might be of academic interest since such high field strengths can not be reached without strongly ionizing the hydrogen atom during earlier parts of the pulse where the field strength is in the region we focus on in this paper . in real experiments , with rare gases for instance , there are of course stronger bound electrons which get free not before @xmath69 but for those electrons @xmath70 is larger too .",
    "we will discuss the scaling behavior of the ionization rate with respect to @xmath71 lateron .",
    "the rates of posthumus ( p ) and mulser ( m ) saturate at higher field strenghts .",
    "this is owing to taking the _ unperturbed _ inneratomic motion to derive an ionization current . in reality",
    ", however , the external field influences the inneratomic motion of the electron and yields a higher ionization current .",
    "the tunneling theories ( l , a1 and a2 ) are even worse when extrapolated to higher field strengths ; they predict a decreasing ionization rate which is clearly unphysical .",
    "note that `` stabilization '' can not occur when ionization lasts less than one laser cycle .",
    "although the keldysh rate ( k ) does not suffer from these shortcomings it underestimates the ionization rate by a factor three and more .",

    "moreover , a small laser frequency keeps the portion of already ionized probability density far away from the ionic nucleus most of the time since the excursion length is large .",

    "we conclude that even for the simplest atom we can think of , i.e. , atomic hydrogen , none of the theories discussed in this paper predict correctly the ionization rate in short intense laser pulses reaching the bsi regime .",
    "thus , extrapolation of tunneling theories to bsi is not permitted . from the numerical results we deduce that a successful theory should take the influence of the strong laser field on the _ inneratomic _ dynamics into account .",
