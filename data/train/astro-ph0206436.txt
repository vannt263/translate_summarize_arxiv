    "stellar radio astronomy has matured over the past two decades , driven in particular by discoveries made with the largest and most sensitive radio interferometers .",
    "radio emission is of great diagnostic value as it contains telltale signatures not available from any other wavelength regime .",
    "some of the detected radio emission represents the highest - energy particle populations ( mev electrons ) yet accessible on stars , the shortest ( sub - second ) detectable time scales of variability and energy release , and probably refers most closely to the primary energy release responsible for coronal heating .",
    "this review is to a large extent devoted to demonstrating the ubiquity of high - energy processes in stars as revealed by radio diagnostics .",
    "stellar radio sources include thermal and non - thermal magnetic coronae , transition regions and chromospheres , stars shedding winds , colliding - wind binaries , pre - main sequence stars with disks and radio jets , and embedded young objects visible almost exclusively by their radio and millimeter - wave emission .",
    "most recent additions to the zoo of objects are brown dwarfs , and with the increasingly blurred transition from stars to brown dwarfs to giant planets like jupiter and saturn , even the magnetospheres of the latter may have to be considered a manifestation of magnetic activity in the widest sense . to keep the discussion somewhat focused ,",
    "this paper concentrates on physical processes in magnetic coronae , but includes , in a more cursory way , atmospheres of young and forming stars and winds of hot stars .",
    "we do not address in detail the large phenomenology of extended and outflow - related sources such as radio jets , hii regions , masers , herbig - haro objects , and the diverse millimeter / submillimeter phenomenology , e.g. , molecular outflows and dust disks .",
    "compact stellar objects ( white dwarfs , neutron stars , black holes ) are not considered here .",
    "inevitably - and fortunately - much of the knowledge gained in stellar astronomy is anchored in solar experience .",
    "the privilege of having a fine specimen - and even an exemplary prototype - next door is unique among various fields of extrasolar astrophysics , being shared since recently only by the related field of extrasolar planetary astronomy .",
    "detailed solar studies , even in - situ measurements of the solar wind , are setting high standards for studies of stellar atmospheres , with a high potential reward .",
    "solar radio astronomy has been reviewed extensively in the literature . for detailed presentations , we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the maturity of stellar radio astronomy is demonstrated by a number of review articles on various subjects ; a non - exhaustive list for further reference includes @xcite , and @xcite . a natural starting point for this review , even if not strictly adhered to , is dulk s comprehensive 1985 annual review article that summarizes the pre- and early - very large array view of stellar ( and solar ) radio emission .",
    "meanwhile , two dedicated conferences , the first one in boulder in 1984 ( proceedings edited by @xcite ) and the second held in barcelona in 1995 ( proceedings edited by @xcite ) , provided a rich forum to discuss new developments ; together , they beautifully illustrate the progress made over the past decades .",
    "figure  [ hrd ] presents a radio hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) based on stellar radio detections between 1@xmath010  ghz , reported in the catalog of @xcite ; for other examples , see @xcite .",
    "the luminosity is the logarithmic average of all reported detections .",
    "the accuracy of the location of some stars on the hrd is compromised by the limited quality of distance and color measurements , or in multiple systems , by the uncertain attribution of the radio emission to one of the components .",
    "nevertheless , almost all of the usual features of an hrd are recovered , testifying to the importance and ubiquity of radio emission .",
    "the many nearby m dwarfs in figure  [ hrd ] were among the first radio stars surveyed .",
    "the typically larger distances to earlier - type cool dwarfs made their discovery more of an adventure , but the samples now include late - type binaries , k stars , solar analog g stars , and a few f stars .",
    "most radio - detected dwarf stars are strong x - ray sources and young , rapid rotators .    the cool half of the subgiant and giant area is dominated by the large and radio - strong sample of rs cvn and algol - type close binaries .",
    "other sources in this area include the vigorous coronal radio sources of the fk com class , chromospheric radio sources , symbiotic stars and thermal - wind emitters .",
    "additionally , a very prominent population of thermal or non - thermal sources just above the main sequence is made up of various classes of pre - main sequence stars , such as classical and weak - lined t tauri stars .",
    "common to most cool star radio emitters is their non - thermal nature which , especially in its `` quiescent '' form , constitutes one of the most significant - and unexpected - discoveries in stellar radio astronomy , suggesting the presence of magnetic fields and high - energy electrons .",
    "moving toward a - type stars on the hrd , one expects , and finds , a dearth of radio detections owing to the absence of magnetic dynamo action .",
    "however , this is also the region of the chemically peculiar ap / bp stars that possess strong magnetic fields and many of which are now known to be non - thermal radio sources as well .",
    "some pre - main sequence herbig ae / be stars in this area are also prominent radio emitters .",
    "finally , the hot - star region is heavily populated by luminous wind - shedding o and b stars and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , both classes showing evidence for either thermal or non - thermal radio emission .",

    "the discovery of quiescent radio emission from magnetically active stars was one of the most fundamental and one of the least anticipated achievements in radio astronomy of cool stars because there simply is no solar counterpart .",
    "the sun emits steady , full - disk , optically thick thermal radio emission at chromospheric and transition region levels of a few @xmath113  k. however , one derives from equation  [ rayleighjeans ] that such emission can not be detected with present - day facilities , except for radiation from the very nearest stars , or giants subtending a large solid angle ( see `` radio emission from chromospheres and winds , '' below ) .",
    "the radio luminosity of the corona caused by optically thin bremsstrahlung is proportional to the observed x - ray emission measure , but again the calculated radio fluxes are orders of magnitude below observed fluxes @xcite . obviously , another mechanism is in charge , and its characterization requires a proper description of the phenomenology .",
    "quiescent emission is best defined by the absence of impulsive , rapidly variable flare - like events .",
    "common characteristics of quiescent emission are ( i ) slow variations on time scales of hours and days @xcite , ( ii ) broad - band microwave spectra @xcite , ( iii ) brightness temperatures in excess of coronal temperatures measured in x - rays @xcite , and often ( iv ) low polarization degrees @xcite .",
    "occasionally , strong steady polarization up to 50% @xcite or unexpectedly narrow - band steady emission @xcite is seen on m dwarfs .",
    "quiescent emission has been reported at frequencies as low as 843  mhz @xcite and as high as 40  ghz @xcite .",
    "because active stars show high coronal temperatures and large magnetic filling factors @xcite that prevent magnetic fields from strongly diverging with increasing height , the radio optical depth can become significant at coronal levels owing to gyroresonance absorption ( equation  [ gyroresonance_kappa ] ) .",

    "the emission occurs at low harmonics of @xmath84 , typically at @xmath114 @xcite .",

    "however , in most cases high - frequency fluxes are lower than predicted from a uniform , full - disk gyroresonance layer , constraining the filling factor of strong magnetic fields immersed in hot plasma .",
    "it is possible that the hot plasma resides in low-@xmath34 field regions where the gyroresonance absorption is negligible , for example between strong fields from underlying active regions , or at large heights @xcite .",
    "uniform magnetic structures of @xmath102600  g containing hot plasma can , on average , not reach out to beyond 1@xmath02@xmath96 on m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the gyroresonance mechanism can not apply to lower - frequency radio emission , because the radius of the optically thick layer , still at @xmath116 , would have to be @xmath117 for dme stars . however",
    ", an extrapolation of the corresponding magnetic fields of more than 100  g down to photospheric levels would result in photospheric fields much stronger than observed @xcite .",
    "the only remedy is to allow for much higher @xmath9 .",
    "then , the optically thick layer shifts to harmonics above 10 , the range of gyrosynchrotron radiation , and the optically thick source sizes become more reasonable for m dwarfs , @xmath118 @xcite . for a thermal plasma , however , the spectral power drops like @xmath119 at high frequencies ( equation  [ thermalsynchrotron_eta ] ) , far from the rather shallow @xmath120 spectra of active stars ( @xcite ; figure  [ spec ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "an optically thick thermal contribution requires strong magnetic fields ( @xmath102200  g ) over such large source areas that inferred photospheric magnetic fields again become unrealistically large @xcite .",
    "the situation is much more favorable for a non - thermal electron energy distribution such as a power law , analogous to distributions inferred for solar and stellar microwave flares @xcite .",
    "this model is supported by measured high brightness temperatures @xcite .",
    "comprehensive spectral modeling suggests mildly relativistic electrons in @xmath102100  g fields with power - law indices of @xmath121 , matching observed broad spectra with turnover frequencies in the @xmath122  ghz range ( @xcite ; figure  [ spec ] ) .",
    "the non - thermal model is now quite well established for many classes of active stars and provokes the question of how these coronae are continuously replenished with high - energy electrons .",

    "an interesting possibility is large numbers of unresolved , superimposed coherent bursts @xcite .",
    "the question of the nature of stellar quiescent radio emission has defined one of the most fascinating aspects of stellar radio astronomy . a number of observations seem to suggest that flares play an important role - quiescent emission",
    "could simply be made up of unresolved flares .",
    "inevitably , this question relates to the physics of coronal heating and the presence of x - ray coronae .",
    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) studies of rs cvn binaries suggest that `` flare cores '' progressively expand into a large - scale magnetosphere around the star , radiating for several days ( `` flare remnant emission '' ) .",
    "the electron distributions then evolve from initial power - law distributions as they are subject to collisional losses affecting the low - energy electrons and to synchrotron losses affecting the high - energy electrons .",
    "time - dependent calculations predict rather flat spectra similar to those observed @xcite .",
    "very long quiescent episodes with little flux changes impose challenges for flare - decay models .",
    "limitations on the collisional losses ( equation  [ collloss ] ) require a very low ambient electron density @xcite .",
    "frequent electron injection at many sites may be an alternative . based on spectral observations ,",
    "@xcite suggest that the emission around 1.4  ghz is composed of a steady , weakly polarized broad - band gyrosynchrotron component plus superimposed , strongly and oppositely polarized , fluctuating plasma emission that is perceived as quasi - steady but that may occasionally evolve into strong , polarized flare emission ( @xcite ; figure  [ light ] ) .",
    "rs cvn and algol - type binaries also reveal significant , continuous gyrosynchrotron variability on time scales of @xmath10210@xmath090 minutes during @xmath10230% of the time , with an increasing number of events with decreasing flux @xcite .",
    "these flare - like events may constitute a large part of the quiescent gyrosynchrotron emission .",
    "however , `` microbursts '' or `` nanoflares '' with durations on the order of seconds to a few minutes are usually not detected at available sensitivities @xcite although @xcite found some rapid variability on time scales between 30  s and 1  h that they interpreted as being due to variable absorption by thermal plasma .",
    "the chromospheric evaporation scenario devised for many solar flares assumes that accelerated coronal electrons precipitate into the chromosphere where they lose their kinetic energy by collisions , thereby heating the cool plasma to coronal flare temperatures and evaporating it into the corona .",
    "the radio gyrosynchrotron emission from the accelerated electrons is roughly proportional to the injection rate of electrons , whereas the x - ray luminosity is roughly proportional to the accumulated energy in the hot plasma . to first order ,",
    "one expects @xmath123 a relation that is known as the `` neupert effect '' @xcite and that has been well observed on the sun in most impulsive and many gradual flares @xcite .",
    "the search for stellar equivalents has been a story of contradictions if not desperation ( figure  [ neupertfig ] ) .",
    "a first breakthrough came with simultaneous euv ( a proxy for x - rays ) and optical observations ( a proxy for the radio emission ) of a flare on ad leo @xcite and radio + x - ray observations of flares on uv cet ( @xcite ; figure  [ neupertfig]a ) .",
    "the latter revealed a relative timing between the emissions that is very similar to solar flares . also , the energy ratios seen in non - thermal and thermal emissions are similar to solar analogs but , perhaps more interesting , they are also similar to the corresponding ratio for the quiescent losses .",
    "these observations suggest that high - energy particles are the ultimate cause for heating through chromospheric evaporation not only in flares , but also in the `` quiescent '' state .",
    "in retrospect , further suggestive examples of the neupert effect can be found in the published literature , most notably in @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the neupert effect is observed neither in each solar flare ( 50% of solar gradual flares show a different behavior ; dennis & zarro 1993 ) , nor in each stellar flare .",
    "stellar counter - examples include an impulsive optical flare with following gradual radio emission @xcite , gyrosynchrotron emission that peaks after the soft x - rays @xcite , and an x - ray depression during strong radio flaring @xcite . note also that complete absence of correlated flaring has been observed at radio and uv wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "radio detections are preferentially made among the x - ray brightest stars @xcite , a result that is corroborated by new , unbiased all - sky surveys @xcite . for rs cvn and algol binaries ,",
    "one finds a correlation between the radio and x - ray luminosities , @xmath124 @xcite , whereas for late - type dwarfs , a rather tight linear correlation appears to apply @xcite .",
    "in fact , several classes of active stars and solar flares follow a similar relation . overall , for 5@xmath08  ghz emission , @xmath125\\ ] ] ( @xcite ; figure  [ lxlr ] ) . phenomenologically , the relation simply suggests that both radio and x - ray emissions are activity indicators that reflect the level of magnetic activity .",
    "the most straightforward physical model , proposed by @xcite , assumes that hot plasma emits both thermal x - rays and non - thermal gyrosynchrotron radiation , but this model predicts steep ( @xmath67 ) optically thin spectra that are not observed .",
    "@xcite argued that the build - up of magnetic energy in magnetic loops is @xmath126 and proportional to the gradient of the turbulent velocity ( assumed to be similar in all stars ) . since most of the energy in the magnetic fields is eventually radiated away in x - rays , @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the source volume .",
    "a power - law electron population in the same loop emits optically thin radio radiation as @xmath129 for given @xmath8 ( equation  [ gyrosynchrotron_eta ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath130 . for @xmath131 , the dependence on @xmath128 is small and @xmath132 , close to the reported relations .",
    "if the quiescent emission is made up of numerous solar - like coronal flares , then the high - energy particles carry their energy downward to heat chromospheric plasma . for a steady - state situation in which the electron injection rate is balanced by an unspecified electron loss mechanism ,",
    "one derives a relation between the synchrotron losses , the particle life time , and the energy losses in x - rays . using the empirical correlation",
    ", @xcite estimated an electron life time that indeed corresponds quite well to the observed radio variability time scales .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite presented detailed model calculations for the alternative situation of simultaneous heating and particle acceleration in current sheets .",

    "electron cyclotron maser emission can be used to estimate the field strength in the source region , namely in converging , lower - coronal fields . because the radiation is emitted at the fundamental ( @xmath133 ) or the second harmonic ( @xmath88 ) of the gyrofrequency , @xmath134  g @xcite .",
    "coronal gyroresonance emission detected at 8@xmath023  ghz is optically thick at harmonics @xmath116 of @xmath135 ( see `` gyromagnetic emission mechanisms , '' above ) , hence @xmath136  g in low - lying loops in active regions @xcite .",
    "large coronal sizes as seen by vlbi restrict field strengths to typically 10@xmath0200  g if the approximate dipolar extrapolation to the photosphere should not produce excessive surface field strengths @xcite .",
    "very high synchrotron brightness temperatures @xmath12 constrain , together with the power - law index @xmath137 , the characteristic harmonic numbers @xmath38 and therefore the field strength @xcite .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite found @xmath34 between @xmath138  g and several tens of g for rs cvn halo sources , and a few tens to several hundred g for the core .",
    "further , the electron energy is @xmath139 for optically thick emission , and @xmath140 for optically thin emission . equation  [ peaknu ] for synchrotron emission ( @xmath141 ) then implies @xmath142}\\ ] ] where the @xmath143 sign applies for optically thin emission . alternatively , from @xcite one finds for gyrosynchrotron emission @xmath144 .",
    "such arguments lead to field strengths of a few tens to a few hundred g in rs cvn binaries @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron turnover frequency @xmath50 determines @xmath34 through @xmath145 where @xmath49 is the source diameter in arcsec , @xmath146 is the radio flux density in mjy at @xmath50 which is given in units of ghz here ( @xcite , after @xcite ) . for a typical rs cvn or dme coronal source with a size of 1 milliarcsec ( mas ) as measured by vlbi , a turnover at @xmath147  ghz and a flux of 10  mjy ,",
    "magnetic fields of up to a few hundred g are inferred . for dipolar active region gyrosynchrotron models",
    ", @xcite derived @xmath148 ( @xmath50 in ghz ) , which again implies field strengths of several hundred g for turnover frequencies in the ghz range .",
    "full spectral modeling of the magnetic field strength @xmath34 , the non - thermal particle density , the geometric size , and the electron power - law index @xmath137 can constrain some of these parameters . @xcite and @xcite found @xmath149  g in their models for core plus halo structures in algol - type stars .",
    "although the photospheric filling factor of kg magnetic fields on the sun is small , it can exceed 50% on late - type active stars . on the sun , magnetic fields",
    "can rapidly expand above the transition region and thus drop below kg levels . on magnetically active stars ,",
    "such divergence is prevented by adjacent magnetic flux lines so that strong magnetic fields may exist also at coronal levels .",
    "the effective scale height of the coronal magnetic field however also largely depends on the structure of the magnetic flux lines , i.e. , on whether they are compact loops with short baselines , long loops connecting distant active regions , or large dipolar magnetospheres anchored at the stellar poles .",
    "this issue is unresolved .",
    "arguments for small - scale coronal active regions as well as for star - sized global magnetospheres have been put forward ( see discussions in @xcite , and @xcite ) .      eclipses and rotational modulation offer reliable information on radio source geometries , but neither are frequently seen .",
    "the radio sources may be much larger than the eclipsing star , or they may not be within the eclipse zone .",
    "complete absence of radio eclipses has , for example , been reported for ar lac @xcite , algol @xcite , and yy gem @xcite .",
    "positive detections include the algol system v505 sgr @xcite and the pre - cataclysmic system v471 tau @xcite .",
    "the former surprisingly shows both a primary and a secondary eclipse although one of the components is supposed to be inactive .",
    "the authors suggested that a radio coronal component is located between the two stars , a conjecture that gives rise to interesting theoretical models such as diffusion of magnetic fields from the active to the inactive star ( on unreasonably long time scales , however ) , or radio emission from the optically thin mass accretion stream ( which is found to be too weak ) , or field shearing by the inactive companion .",
    "the radio emission of v471 tau may originate from magnetic loops that extend to the white dwarf where they interact with its magnetic field @xcite .",
    "radio rotational modulation is often masked by intrinsic variability @xcite .",
    "well - documented examples are the rs cvn binaries cf tuc @xcite for which @xcite suggested the presence of material in the intrabinary region , and the rs cvn binary ux ari , which appears to have radio - emitting material concentrated above magnetic spots on the hemisphere of the k subgiant that is invisible from the companion @xcite .",
    "the clearest main - sequence example is ab dor , with two emission peaks per rotation seen repeatedly over long time intervals .",
    "both peaks probably relate to preferred longitudes of active regions @xcite .",
    "the shape of the maxima suggests that the radiation is intrinsically directed in the source , which is plausible for synchrotron emission by ultrarelativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "interferometry at large baselines has long been a privilege of radio astronomy and has proven versatile for numerous applications @xcite .",
    "various intercontinental very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) networks have been arranged , and dedicated networks such as the us very large baseline array ( vlba ) or the uk merlin network are routinely available .",
    "apart from astrometric applications with sub - mas accuracy @xcite , vlbi provides coronal mapping at @xmath150  mas angular resolution .",
    "one of the principal , early vlbi results for rs cvn and algol - like binaries relates to evidence for a compact core plus extended halo radio structure of a total size similar to the binary system size @xcite .",
    "compact cores appear to be flaring sites , whereas halo emission corresponds to quiescent , low - level radiation , perhaps from decaying electrons from previous flares .",
    "there is evidence for non - concentric , moving , or expanding sources @xcite .",
    "pre - main sequence stars are attractive vlbi targets .",
    "although some sources are overresolved at vlbi baselines @xcite , others have been recognized as components in close binaries such as hd 283447 @xcite ; but most of the nearby weak - lined t tau stars ( see `` evolution to the main sequence , '' below ) reveal radio structures as large as 10@xmath96 , indicative of extended , global , probably dipolar - like magnetospheres somewhat similar to those seen in rs cvn binaries @xcite . perhaps also related to youth , magnetospheres around bp / ap stars have also been observed with vlbi and have strongly supported global magnetospheric models ( @xcite ; see `` stars at the interface between hot winds and coronae , '' below ) .",
    "vlbi techniques have been more demanding for single late - type dwarf stars , owing both to lower flux levels and apparently smaller coronal sizes .",
    "some observations with mas angular resolutions show unresolved quiescent or flaring sources , thus constraining the brightness temperature to @xmath151  k @xcite , whereas others show evidence for extended coronae with coronal sizes up to several times the stellar size @xcite .",
    "the dme star uv cet is surrounded by a pair of giant synchrotron lobes , with sizes up to @xmath152  cm and a separation of 4@xmath05 stellar radii along the putative rotation axis of the star , suggesting very extended magnetic structures above the magnetic poles ( @xcite ; figure  [ vlba]a ) .",
    "vlba imaging and polarimetry of algol reveals a similar picture with two oppositely polarized radio lobes separated along a line perpendicular to the orbital plane by more than the diameter of the k star ( @xcite ; figures  [ vlba]b , [ models]b ) .",
    "global polarization structure is also suggested in ux ari , supporting the view that the magnetic fields are large - scale and well ordered @xcite .",
    "quite detailed geometric models of large magnetospheres around rs cvn and algol binaries , t tau stars , and magnetic bp / ap stars have been designed based on vlbi results , radio spectra and polarization .",
    "common to all is a global , dipole - like structure somewhat resembling the earth s van allen belts ( figure  [ models]a ) .",
    "stellar winds escaping along magnetic fields draw the field lines into a current sheet configuration in the equatorial plane .",
    "particles accelerated in that region travel back and are trapped in the dipolar - like , equatorial magnetospheric cavity . variants of this radiation belt model , partly based on theoretical work of @xcite , have been applied to rs cvn binaries @xcite , in an optically thick version to bp / ap stars @xcite and in an optically thin version to a young b star @xcite .",
    "such models are particularly well supported by polarization measurements in rs cvn binaries . for a given system ,",
    "the polarization degree @xmath153 at any frequency is anticorrelated with the luminosity , while the sense of polarization changes between lower and higher frequencies . for a stellar sample",
    ", @xmath153 is inversely correlated with the stellar inclination angle such that low - inclination ( `` pole - on '' ) systems show the strongest polarization degrees @xcite .",
    "when flares are in progress , the two - component core plus halo model appears to correctly describe radio spectral properties .",
    "stronger magnetic fields of 80@xmath0200  g are inferred for the core and weaker fields of 10@xmath030  g for the halo @xcite .",
    "the frequency - dependent optical depth makes the source small at high frequencies ( size @xmath154 , above 10  ghz ) and large at small frequencies ( size comparable to the binary system size at 1.4  ghz ; @xcite ) .",
    "this effect correctly explains the relatively flat , optically thick radio spectra seen during flares .",
    "there is little doubt that rotation is largely responsible for the level of magnetic activity in cool stars .",
    "it is clearly the young , rapidly rotating stars or spun - up evolved stars in tidally interacting binaries that define the vast majority of radio - emitting cool stars detected to date .",
    "the rather peculiar class of fk com stars , single giants with unusually short rotation periods of only a few days , are among the most vigorous emitters of gyrosynchrotron emission @xcite , including extremely luminous and long flares @xcite . however , large surveys of rs cvn binary systems find at best a weak correlation between radio luminosity and rotation parameters @xcite , and it may even depend on the optical luminosity class considered .",
    "although @xcite reported a trend of the form @xmath155 ( @xmath92 is the equatorial velocity ) for different luminosity classes , this result was later challenged @xcite and may be related to using peak fluxes and flares .",
    "the absence of a correlation may be related to the coronal saturation regime known in x - rays @xcite : almost all radio - detected stars emit at the maximum possible and rotation - independent x - ray level - hence perhaps also at the maximum possible radio level .",
    "there is obviously a large potential for stellar radio astronomy in the less exotic regime below saturation !    moving to tighter binary systems in which the components are in ( near-)contact",
    ", we would expect magnetic activity to increase or at least to stay constant .",
    "this is however not the case .",
    "the radio emission of such systems is significantly weaker than that of rs cvn binaries or active single stars , a trend that is also seen at other wavelengths @xcite .",
    "possible physical causes include i ) a reduced differential rotation , hence a weaker dynamo action @xcite , ii ) a shallower convection zone in contact binary systems , and iii ) influence by the energy transfer between contacting stars @xcite",
    ".      radio polarization may be a telltale indicator for magnetic activity cycles on stars , analogous to the solar 11  year cycle ( or 22  years , if the magnetic polarity reversal is considered ) .",
    "long - term measurements in the ca h&k lines ( the hk project ; @xcite ) indicate the presence of activity cycles with durations of several years in low - activity stars , but irregular long - term variations on active stars . in any case",
    ", one would expect reversals of the dominant sense of polarization to accompany any of these quasi - cycles .",
    "the contrary is true , to an embarrassing level : after decades of monitoring , many active stars show a constant sign of radio polarization throughout , both in quiescence and during flares @xcite with few exceptions @xcite .",
    "this suggests the presence of some stable magnetospheric structures or a predominance of strong magnetic fields in one polarity .",
    "a concerted and ongoing effort to look for polarity reversals is negative at the time of this writing ( s. white , private communication ) .",
    "perhaps the most convincing case yet reported in favor of a magnetic cycle is hr  1099 in which the average radio flux density correlates with the spot coverage , revealing a possible periodicity of 15@xmath020 years @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a surprisingly rapid quasi - periodicity in microwave activity ( @xmath156  days ) and the accompanying sense of polarization ( @xmath157  days ) in the rs cvn binary ux ari .",
    "whether such rapid oscillations are related to an internal magnetic dynamo cycle remains to be shown .",
    "stellar transition regions and chromospheres are expected to be radio sources as well ( see `` quiescent emission from coronae of cool stars , '' above ) . among cool main - sequence stars ,",
    "the slightly evolved mid - f star procyon is the only such source in the solar vicinity detected to date @xcite . in the red giant area , however , outer atmospheres fundamentally change their characteristics .",
    "chromospheres become as large as several stellar radii .",
    "such sources are now well detected at radio wavelengths @xcite and spatially resolved @xcite , albeit with some surprises . because their outer atmospheres are optically thick at radio wavelengths , spatially resolved observations provide a direct temperature measurement .",
    "@xcite inferred optically thick `` radio photospheres '' at about 2@xmath96 but at subphotospheric / nonchromospheric temperatures .",
    "indeed , contrary to chromospheric uv measurements , the radio - derived temperature in the nearby supergiant betelgeuse is seen to drop systematically from optical - photospheric levels outward ( @xcite ; figure  [ betelgeuse ] ) .",
    "this cool material completely dominates the outer atmosphere .",
    "the authors suggested that cool , photospheric material is elevated in giant convection cells ; dust formation in this environment could then drive betelgeuse s outflow .      could dwarf stars lose mass by a substantial stellar wind @xcite ?",
    "such a wind , if ( partially ) ionized , would be a radio source .",
    "the very fact that coronal radio flares are seen at ghz frequencies implies that the extended winds must be optically thin down to coronal heights , and this places stringent limits on the mass loss rate .",
    "sensitive millimeter measurements and theoretical arguments have constrained such mass loss for m dwarfs to @xmath158  yr@xmath3 or @xmath159  yr@xmath3 for a @xmath113  k or a @xmath160  k wind , respectively @xcite , in agreement with upper limits derived from uv observations @xcite .",
    "stringent upper limits to the radio emission of solar analogs also help confine the mass loss history of the sun or solar - like stars @xcite .",
    "an upper limit to the mass loss during the sun s main - sequence life of @xmath161 indicates that the sun was never sufficiently luminous to explain the `` young sun paradox '' , i.e. , the suggestion that the young sun was more luminous in early times given the apparently much warmer climate on mars @xcite .",
    "winds become progressively more important toward the red giants , in particular beyond the corona - cool wind dividing line .",
    "ionized - mass losses between @xmath162  yr@xmath3 are indicated , increasing toward cooler and more luminous stars @xcite . however , the surface mass loss flux is similar in all stars , in fact also similar to the solar wind mass loss flux .",
    "the coolest , late - m and c ( super)giants still support massive winds , but the much weaker radio emission indicates that the ionization fraction drops by at least an order of magnitude compared to earlier m giants , i.e. , their chromospheres must be cool , and their optical depth at radio wavelengths becomes small @xcite .",
    "the same holds for technetium - deficient s and m - s giants , although white dwarf companions of some of them may sufficiently ionize the outer atmosphere of the giant to become visible at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this latter mechanism is probably also relevant in the interacting `` symbiotic binaries '' that usually consist of a red giant and a white dwarf companion and that are radio sources with considerable luminosities .",
    "the white dwarf is sufficiently uv strong to ionize part of the cool - star wind @xcite .",
    "no appreciable radio emission is , however , detected from the similar class of g and k - type barium stars ( showing overabundances of ba and other nuclear - processed elements ) , although they show evidence of white - dwarf companions @xcite .      because ob and wolf - rayet stars shed strong ionized winds , they emit thermal - wind radio emission ( equations  [ wind ] ) .",
    "some of the hot - star radio sources are very large and resolved by the vla because the optically thick surface ( equation  [ windsurface ] ) is located at hundreds of stellar radii . under the assumption of a steady , spherically symmetric wind ,",
    "wind mass - loss rates of @xmath163  yr@xmath3 are inferred for o and b stars @xcite , and @xmath164  yr@xmath3 for wr stars @xcite .",
    "the inferred mass - loss rate is closely correlated with the bolometric luminosity , @xmath165 @xcite , in good agreement with h@xmath48 measurements . in the case of colliding wind binaries ,",
    "the thermal radio emission can be further enhanced by contributions from the wind - shock zone @xcite .",
    "the radio emission level drops appreciably toward intermediate spectral classes of b , a , and f , probably owing to a steep decrease of the ionized mass loss @xcite .",
    "it came as a surprise when several ob stars @xcite and wr stars @xcite were found to show non - thermal , synchrotron - like radio spectra , some of them associated with short - term variability @xcite . up to 50% of the wr stars",
    "appear to be non - thermal sources , and this fraction is half as large for ob stars @xcite .",
    "hot stars are not thought to produce magnetic fields via a dynamo .",
    "moreover , because the wind is optically thick to radio emission out to hundreds of stellar radii , the non - thermal component must originate at such large distances as well .",
    "a coronal model should therefore not apply although highly variable radio emission and a poor correlation with x - ray behavior may suggest that magnetic fields play a role in the structuring of the winds @xcite .",
    "viable alternatives include synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated in shocks of unstable winds of single stars @xcite , in colliding - wind shocks in massive binaries @xcite , and in the interaction zone between the thermal wind and a previously ejected shell ( luminous blue variable phase ; @xcite ) .",
    "magnetic fields inferred for the photospheric level are of order 1 gauss @xcite , and up to 50  g in synchrotron envelope models @xcite .",
    "shocks are attractive features as they can accelerate electrons by the first - order fermi mechanism , with a predicted electron energy power - law index @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , found a significant deviation from this model for a colliding - wind binary but successfully interpreted their radio spectra with an absorbed synchrotron spectrum from a quasi - monoenergetic electron population .",
    "the origin and stability of such a population are unclear .",
    "the colliding - wind model found strong support when it became evident that most non - thermal sources are indeed binaries @xcite and that the non - thermal sources are located between the two stars , separate from the wind @xcite .",
    "convincing evidence for colliding winds is available for wr  146 @xcite , cygnus ob2 no 5 @xcite , and wr  147 that all show a thermal source coincident with the wr star and a separate bow - shock shaped non - thermal source in the wind collision zone close to a lower - mass companion ( figure  [ wr147 ] , @xcite ) .",
    "if the stars are in a strongly eccentric orbit , the wind - shock zone between two stellar components can enter the thermal - wind radio photosphere and become absorbed , thus producing strong long - term variability of the radio flux @xcite .",
    "further long - term synchrotron variability may be caused by long - term modulation in the magnetic field along the orbit , whereas short - term ( @xmath102daily ) variability may be due to clumps in the wind that arrive at the shock @xcite .",
    "the rather inhomogeneous class of be stars shows evidence for very large ( @xmath167 ) high - density outflowing disks that have been probed at radio wavelengths . steeply increasing radio spectra and some flux variability",
    "are characteristic , but there is considerable debate on the source geometry @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of interferometric observations of non - thermal sources among hot stars .",
    "source sizes of order @xmath168 , exceeding the size of the optically thick surface of the thermal wind , have been measured .",
    "they imply brightness temperatures up to at least @xmath169  k and thus further support the non - thermal interpretation @xcite .",
    "large numbers of visible t tau stars and embedded infrared sources in star forming regions are strong radio sources @xcite .",
    "schematically , pre - main sequence evolution is thought to proceed through four consecutive stages with progressive clearing of circumstellar material @xcite : i ) cold condensations of infalling molecular matter , forming a hydrostatic low - luminosity protostellar object , with the bulk mass still accreting ( `` class 0 source '' ) .",
    "ii ) formation of a deeply embedded protostar ( `` class i source '' ) through further accretion via a massive accretion disk , associated with strong polar outflows .",
    "iii ) the `` classical t tau '' ( ctt , `` class ii '' ) phase with an optically visible star accompanied by a thick accretion disk , a weak outflow , and possibly a weakly ionized wind ; and iv ) the `` weak - lined t tau '' ( wtt , `` class iii '' ) phase at which disk and circumstellar material have largely been dissipated , and the star approaches the main sequence . the evolutionary sequence is somewhat controversial ( see below ) and may in fact describe the evolutionary phase of the circumstellar material rather than of the star itself .    at first inspection , and especially in the outer reaches of the molecular clouds such as the @xmath170 oph cloud @xcite ,",
    "one encounters predominantly wtts that appear to have evolved past the ctt phase .",
    "how early in its infancy can a star be to develop strong radio signatures ?",
    "whereas deeper surveys of @xmath170 oph have accessed several deeply embedded infrared sources with high radio luminosities ( log@xmath171 , some of which are class i sources , @xcite ) many of the radio - strong wtts in the @xmath170 oph dark cloud are significantly closer to the sites of current star formation , and therefore younger , than the typical radio - weaker wtts and ctts .",
    "it seems that radio - strong wtts evolve directly from embedded protostars .",
    "@xcite speculated that in some cases strong fossil magnetic fields accelerate both dissipation of circumstellar material and formation of large magnetospheric structures on short time scales of @xmath172  years .",
    "genuine , embedded class i protostars have most often been detected as thermal sources , and this emission is predominantly due to collimated thermal winds or jets .",
    "these jets are probably ionized by neutral winds that collide with the ambient medium at distances of around 10  au and that are aligned with molecular outflows @xcite . in the case of more massive stars ,",
    "the radio emission can also originate from optically thick or thin compact hii regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or from ionized winds @xcite ; even ( thermal or non - thermal ) gyrosynchrotron emission has been proposed given the high brightness temperatures , small sizes , variability , and negative spectral indices of some sources @xcite . for a review of thermal radio jets driving outflows and herbig - haro objects , see , e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "ionized circumstellar material and winds easily become optically thick and therefore occult any non - thermal , magnetic emission from close to the star .",
    "however , the discovery of polarization in t tau(s ) @xcite , in irs  5 @xcite , in protostellar jet sources @xcite and the jet outflows themselves ( @xcite ; figure  [ ttau ] ) , as well as variability and negative spectral indices in t tau(s ) @xcite provided definitive evidence for magnetic fields and particle acceleration in these class i objects .    moving toward the youngest accreting or class 0 sources , centimetric thermal radio detections",
    "probably again relate to jets / collimated winds that drive massive outflows , whereas the bulk of the emitted power leaves the system at mm / submm wavelengths from cold ( @xmath17320  k ) dust , a defining property of class 0 protostars @xcite .",
    "several objects have been detected , with ages of the order of only @xmath113  years and central stellar masses of only @xmath174 @xcite , marking the very beginning of the protostellar accretion phase .",
    "radio emission is thus a sensitive tracer for the presence of an embedded , nascent but already formed protostellar core as opposed to a contracting cloud fragment ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "early vla surveys of ctts quickly recognized their thermal wind - type emission with rising spectra and large angular sizes @xcite .",
    "the enormous kinetic wind energy derived under the assumption of a uniform spherical wind suggests anisotropic outflows while structural changes in the radio sources indicate variable outflows , probably along jet - like features @xcite .",
    "mass loss rates are estimated to be @xmath175  yr@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the thermal radio emission says nothing about the presence or absence of stellar magnetic fields .",
    "ctts do show a number of magnetically induced phenomena , but whatever the possible accompanying radio emission , it is thought to be absorbed by the circumstellar ionized wind , unless huge magnetospheric structures reach beyond the optically thick wind surface @xcite .",
    "the ctt stage is pivotal for planetary system formation as massive accretion disks are present .",
    "their dust emission dominates the systemic luminosity at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "large ( @xmath1761000  au ) molecular and dust features have been mapped at such wavelengths ; however , observations of the solar - system sized inner disks ( 100  au ) have been challenging and require high angular resolution . at cm wavelengths",

    ", most t tau stars dissipate their accretion disks and circumstellar material and become similar to main - sequence stars albeit at much higher magnetic activity levels , probably induced by their short rotation periods @xcite . the presence of huge flares @xcite , longer - term variability , and falling spectra clearly point to non - thermal gyrosynchrotron emission @xcite analogous to more evolved active stars .",
    "conclusive radio evidence for the presence of solar - like magnetic fields in wtts came with the detection of weak circular polarization during flare - like modulations , but also in quiescence @xcite .",

    "extreme particle energies radiating synchrotron emission may be involved , giving rise to linear polarization in flares on the wtt star hd 283447 @xcite .",
    "vlbi observations showing large ( @xmath10210@xmath96 ) magnetospheric structures with brightness temperatures of @xmath178  k fully support the non - thermal picture @xcite .    as a wtt star ages ,",

    "young age of a star is thus favorable for strong radio emission @xcite , whereas toward the subsequent zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) stage it is only the very rapid rotators that keep producing radio emission at a @xmath179erg  s@xmath3hz@xmath3 level @xcite .",

    ", it may indicate that stars approaching the main sequence go through a regime of strongly enhanced magnetic activity .",
    "the ab dor pair is a member of the local association , also known as the pleiades moving group , a star stream of an age ( @xmath10250@xmath0100  million years ) corresponding to near - zams for f@xmath0k stars . a handful of further stream members with vigorous radio emission",
    "are now known in the solar neighborhood , most notably pz tel ( cited in @xcite ) , hd 197890 ( k1  v ; @xcite ) , hd  82558 ( k1  v , @xcite ) , ek dra ( g0  v , @xcite ) , and 47 cas ( f0  v + g  v ; @xcite ) .    these objects are analogs of young open cluster stars with the observational advantage of being much closer .",

    "the absence of any detections in bastian et al.s ( 1988 ) pleiades radio survey suggests that their flare properties are similar to solar neighborhood stars rather than to the much more energetic outbursts occasionally seen in star forming regions . flaring or quiescent radio emissions have been detected from g@xmath0k - type members of both the pleiades @xcite and the hyades @xcite although these examples , in part ultra - fast rotators at saturated activity levels and in part binary systems , clearly represent only the extreme upper end of magnetic activity .",
    "radio emission of normal , single solar analogs rapidly declines to undetectable levels after a few hundred million years @xcite .",
    "the evolution of intermediate - mass ( @xmath181 ) stars is quite different from , and much faster than , that of low - mass stars as they still accrete while already on the main sequence .",
    "given their intermediate spectral range , it is of great interest to know whether herbig ae / be pre - main sequence stars support convective , magnetic dynamos or whether they resemble more massive wind sources .",
    "radio emission is the ideal discriminator .",
    "a wind - mass loss interpretation is compatible with the expected mass loss rates of @xmath182yr@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the large radio sizes ( order of 1@xmath183 ) and the absence of circular polarization or strong variability .",
    "the radio luminosity is also correlated with the stellar temperature and bolometric luminosity .",
    "this is expected because wind mass - loss rates increase toward higher stellar masses @xcite .",

    "non - thermal gyrosynchrotron sources exist as well among herbig stars , although they are the exception @xcite .",
    "the evidence comes primarily from negative spectral indices , including the extremely x - ray strong proto - herbig star ec95 = s68 - 2 that further supports a coronal model based on its @xmath184 ratio @xcite .",
    "owing to missing convection , no dynamo - generated magnetic fields are expected on stars earlier than spectral type f , nor should there be massive ionized winds on main - sequence stars of spectral type b and later , given the weak radiation pressure .",
    "indeed , few detections have been reported as early as spectral type f0 , although some have been found at quite high luminosities compatible with the gyrosynchrotron mechanism , including main - sequence candidates @xcite and the supergiant @xmath48 car @xcite . @xcite",
    "surveyed a number of normal a - type stars and found stringent upper limits to any radio emission and thus to the mass - loss rate - very much in agreement with expectations . however , as it turns out , this spectral range is shared by some of the more provocative radio detections .",
    "many `` magnetic chemically peculiar '' bp / ap stars maintain considerable radio emission ( log@xmath185 @xmath186 ; @xcite ) , including very young objects such as s1 in @xmath170 oph @xcite .",
    "they all relate to the hotter ( o9@xmath0a0 spectral type ) he - strong and he - weak / si - strong classes , whereas the cooler ( a type ) srcreu peculiarity classes remain undetected @xcite .",
    "similarly , `` non - magnetic '' am and hgmn stars remain undetected despite recent claims that these stars may have magnetic fields as well @xcite .",
    "the emission mechanism is likely to be gyrosynchrotron as judged from flat spectra @xcite , high brightness temperature @xcite , variability , and sometimes moderate polarization @xcite .",
    "the presence of kilogauss magnetic fields on magnetic chemically peculiar stars has been known since 1947 @xcite .",
    "the fields are generally assumed to be of global , dipolar topology .",
    "there is little photospheric motion that could stir magnetic footpoints , but weak winds could draw the magnetic field lines into an equatorial current sheet , thus producing a global `` van allen belt '' magnetospheric structure as described in `` magnetospheric models , '' above . estimated non - thermal source radii are a few stellar radii , confirmed by vlbi observations @xcite that also conclusively established the non - thermal nature of the radio emission , with brightness temperatures of @xmath187  k.    the wind - controlled magnetospheric model is further supported qualitatively by a parameter dependence of the form @xmath188 where @xmath90 is the estimated wind mass - loss rate for the spectral type , @xmath189 is the root - mean square value of the longitudinal magnetic field , and @xmath190 is the stellar rotation period ( the dependence on the latter is marginal ; @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for rotational modulation probably due to field misalignment has been found by @xcite , and @xcite , the latter authors reporting modulation of the polarization degree and sign .",
    "a surprise detection was the phase - dependent 100% polarized radio emission from a bp star that suggests a strongly beamed , continuously radiating electron cyclotron maser @xcite .",
    "a binary class in this spectral range that is thought to be intermediate in evolution between the young semi - detached b - type @xmath191 lyr system that shows radio evidence for large systemic wind mass loss @xcite , and evolved normal algol binaries with non - thermal coronal emission is defined by the rather inhomogeneous sample of serpentid stars or `` peculiar emission line algols '' ( pelas ) .",
    "these typically consist of an a@xmath0b type primary and a f@xmath0k type companion with strong mass transfer into a geometrically thick accretion disk around the early - type star , and a common , thin envelope .",
    "they have shown an appreciable level of radio emission , first thought to be gyrosynchrotron emission based on their large luminosities @xcite but later suspected to be wind sources given their spectral indices close to the standard wind law @xcite .",
    "brown dwarf stars have masses below the critical mass of @xmath192 required for stable hydrogen burning in the stellar core .",
    "detecting radio emission that shows variability , polarization , or gyrosynchrotron - like spectra from brown dwarfs would provide very strong evidence for the existence of surface magnetic fields .",
    "however , after brown dwarfs cease to burn deuterium , the internal convection decreases , probably diminishing the generation of magnetic fields @xcite . a deep 3.6  cm survey with the vla , concentrating on older targets , did indeed fail to produce radio detections @xcite .",
    "one young candidate brown dwarf has been reported with strongly variable radio emission ( p. andr , cited in @xcite and @xcite ) . but",
    "again , nature offered more riddles : the first radio - detected bona - fide brown dwarf , lp944 - 20 , is in fact quite old ( @xmath102500  million years ) , but showed both flaring and quiescent episodes @xcite .",
    "its radio emission is orders of magnitude higher than would be expected from the active - stellar relation  ( [ lxlrrelation ] ) . in any case",
    ", the observed flaring radio emission is a telltale signature of magnetic fields , and proves that solar - like coronal activity is present in substellar objects - even old ones .",
    "a promising method for detecting sub - stellar objects with sufficiently strong magnetic fields involves the operation of the cyclotron maser .",
    "in fact , jupiter s decametric radiation can be as strong as solar coherent bursts , although at somewhat longer wavelengths .",
    "searching nearby stars for low - frequency coherent bursts may , by positional analysis , reveal companion planets or brown dwarfs .",
    "such a study was performed by @xcite , albeit with null results .",
    "we note in passing that one of their targets , gl  411/lalande 21185 , has in the meantime been shown by astrometric means to possess at least one planetary companion @xcite .",
    "vlbi techniques have been used for astrometric purposes , i.e. , measurements of positions , proper motions , binary orbital motions , and parallaxes , to an accuracy of fractions of a milliarcsecond @xcite . while one fundamental purpose of such programs is to establish the astrometric link between the radio and the optical coordinate reference frames that is eventually of great importance for numerous dynamical studies , invaluable astrophysical spin - offs were obtained .",
    "astrometry of the algol triple system ( a 2.9-day period a7m+k0  iv close binary with mass exchange , in a wide 680  d orbit around a b8  v star ) showed unequivocally that the radio emission is related to the magnetically active k subgiant .",
    "the most startling result ( confirming earlier , indirect optical polarization measurements ) was that the planes of the short and the long orbits are orthogonal to each other @xcite , a challenge for stability theories .",
    "further important highlights include i ) precise measurements of distances through parallaxes , including distances to star forming regions , ii ) identification of binarity or multiple systems , and iii ) rapidly moving ejecta after a stellar flare ( see lestrade et al .",
    "1999 for details ) . a dedicated pre - hipparcos vlbi study of the ab doradus system solved for the accurate distance ( moving the star to 2/3 its previously assumed distance and placing it on the zams ) and for a short - period disturbance attributed to the presence of a low - mass object ( possibly a brown dwarf ) in orbit around this star @xcite .",
    "stellar radio astronomy has matured over the past few decades to a science that is indispensable for our understanding of stellar atmospheres .",
    "historical milestones include , among many others , the discovery of steady and flaring non - thermal and polarized emission in cool stars , testifying to the importance of highly energetic processes ; the recognition that these phenomena are ubiquitous in many classes of convective - envelope stars ; observations of very large , apparently stable magnetospheric structures , unlike anything known from the sun , around various types of magnetically active stars such as t tau stars , bp stars , dme stars , or rs cvn binaries ; the discovery of non - thermal emission produced in ( wind - collision ) shocks of hot - star atmospheres ; gyromagnetic and flaring emission from deeply embedded protostellar objects , testifying to the importance of magnetic fields back to the earliest moments of a stellar life ; and flaring radio emission from sub - stellar objects not previously thought to support stellar - like convective outer envelopes .",
    "radio methodology has become a standard to estimate magnetic fields in cool stars , to determine mass loss in stars with ionized winds , to spatially resolve and map structures at the milliarcsecond level , and to simply prove the presence of magnetic fields through polarization measurements .",
    "far from being an auxiliary science to research at other wavelengths , stellar radio astronomy should prepare to address outstanding problems to which it has unique access , although more sensitive instruments are needed .",
    "questions of particular interest include : are there relevant high - energy processes and magnetic fields in class 0 protostars ?",
    "are accretion processes important for the high - energy mechanisms and the generation of large - scale magnetic fields ? are there magnetic fields in hot stars , and what role do they play in the winds ?",
    "are brown dwarfs usually quiescent radio emitters ?",
    "do they maintain stable magnetic fields ?",
    "what is the structure of their coronae ?",
    "are there intra - binary magnetic fields in close binary stars ?",
    "how do large magnetospheres couple to the more compact x - ray coronae ?",
    "are quiescent coronae fed by numerous ( micro-)flares ? 0.5truecm    acknowledgements : it is a pleasure to thank marc audard , arnold benz , stephen skinner , kester smith , and stephen white for helpful discussions , and philippe andr , tim bastian , arnold benz , maria contreras , jeremy lim , robert mutel , tom ray , luis rodrguez , and stephen white for providing figure material .",

    "<S> radio astronomy has provided evidence for the presence of ionized atmospheres around almost all classes of non - degenerate stars . </S>",
    "<S> magnetically confined coronae dominate in the cool half of the hertzsprung - russell diagram . </S>",
    "<S> their radio emission is predominantly of non - thermal origin and has been identified as gyrosynchrotron radiation from mildly relativistic electrons , apart from some coherent emission mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> ionized winds are found in hot stars and in red giants . </S>",
    "<S> they are detected through their thermal , optically thick radiation , but synchrotron emission has been found in many systems as well . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is emitted presumably by shock - accelerated electrons in weak magnetic fields in the outer wind regions . </S>",
    "<S> radio emission is also frequently detected in pre - main sequence stars and protostars , and has recently been discovered in brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> this review summarizes the radio view of the atmospheres of non - degenerate stars , focusing on energy release physics in cool coronal stars , wind phenomenology in hot stars and cool giants , and emission observed from young and forming stars .    </S>",
