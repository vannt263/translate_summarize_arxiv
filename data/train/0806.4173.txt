    "advances in the experimental techniques for manipulating and contacting atomic - sized objects have turned the vision of molecular - scale electronic circuits into a realistic goal .",
    "this has intensified the interdisciplinary efforts to study charge transport in nanostructures .",
    "ideally , the circuits would be constructed in a bottom - up approach with functional units and all the wiring on the molecular scale . to approach the goal ,",
    "present - day experiments in the area of molecular electronics concentrate on measuring the current - voltage response of single molecules in contact to metallic electrodes . in these studies , also purely metallic atomic contacts and wires serve as important reference systems .    in order to support the experiments and to stimulate further technological advance , theoretical modeling of atomic - scale charge transport",
    "is needed .",
    "here one faces the challenge to describe infinitely extended , low - symmetry quantum systems that may , in addition , be far from equilibrium and involve strong electronic correlations . while a complete theoretical understanding is still lacking , sophisticated _ ab - initio _ methods have been developed for approximate but parameter - free numerical simulations . in order to study the prototypical metal - molecule - metal systems or metallic atomic contacts",
    ", many groups use density functional theory ( dft ) combined with nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) techniques.@xcite some shortcomings related to the use of dft in this context have been pointed out , and solutions are being sought.@xcite on the other hand , from a practical point of view dft presently appears to be one of the most useful _ ab - initio _ electronic structure methods , since studies of quantum transport require dealing with a large number of atoms .",
    "furthermore the metal - molecule - metal contacts are hybrid systems , where the central regions frequently behave rather insulator - like , while the electrodes are metallic . for more complete discussions we refer to refs .  .",
    "the dft approaches can mainly be divided into two types . in the first one",
    ", atomic - sized contacts are modelled by periodically repeated supercells , and computer codes developed for solid - state calculations are employed .",
    "the use of periodic boundary conditions facilitates the electrode description .",
    "however , the conductance is determined for an array of parallel junctions and may be affected by artifical interactions between them .",
    "the second type is based on finite clusters and originates more from the chemistry community .",
    "it has the advantage that genuinely single - atom or single - molecule contacts are described , and it makes possible investigations of molecules of large transverse extent .",
    "the drawback is typically the description of the electrode , since it is difficult to treat bulk properties based on finite clusters .",
    "furthermore the coupling between the device region and the electrode can be complicated by finite - size and surface mismatch effects .    to arrive at an dft description it is necessary to treat the whole system consistently by using the same basis set and exchange - correlation functional everywhere .",
    "the problem of the cluster - based approaches regarding the electrodes is apparent , for example , from the work of refs . , where the authors resort to a separate tight - binding parameterization obtained from the literature .",
    "damle proposed to resolve this issue by extracting electrode parameters from finite clusters computed within dft .",
    "however , their treatment of the electrodes should be seen as a first approximation , since only couplings between nearest neighbor atoms were considered .",
    "furthermore , they finally use energy - independent self - energies , which is well - justified only for electrode materials with a constant density of states ( dos ) near the fermi energy .    in this work we present a cluster - based dft approach for the atomistic description of quantum transport .",
    "we follow the ideas of ref .  , but place special emphasis on the treatment of the electrodes . in particular , we show that extracting electrode parameters from small metal clusters can lead to an unphysical behavior of the overlap of the nonorthogonal basis functions in @xmath0-space . the description of the electrodes can be improved systematically by employing metal clusters of increasing size .",
    "our implemenation is based on the quantum - chemistry package turbomole , which allows us to treat clusters of several hundred atoms . in this way",
    "we obtain an _ ab - initio _ formulation of quantum transport in atomic - sized contacts , where the whole system is treated on an equal footing .",
    "it has the advantage that we can employ high - quality quantum - chemical gaussian basis sets , which are well - tested for isolated systems .",
    "the theoretical framework of our approach is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : theoretical - approach ] .",
    "several technical details , related to the use of nonorthogonal basis functions and the electrode treatment can be found in apps .",
    "[ sec : no - basis - sets ] and [ sec : electrodedft - electrode - description ] . to demonstrate the power of our methods we study in sec .",
    "[ sec : aualcontacts ] the transport properties of atomic contacts of au and al .",
    "the choice of these materials is motivated by the fact that au exhibits a rather energy - independent dos near the fermi energy , while al does not .",
    "furthermore , for these systems we can compare our results to the literature .",
    "we find good agreement , and demonstrate the robustness of our results .",
    "further applications have been presented in refs .  .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our _ ab - initio _ calculations are based on the implementation of dft in turbomole 5.9.@xcite by _ ab - initio _ we mean that the simulations require no system - specific parameters .",
    "self - consistent dft calculations of large systems are generally very time - consuming .",
    "turbomole , however , is specialized in handling such systems , and offers several possibilities to reduce the computational effort .",
    "thus , one can exploit point group symmetries , including non - abelian ones . in this way ,",
    "the calculations speed up by a factor given by the order of the point group .",
    "further options are the `` resolution of the identity in @xmath1 '' ( ri-@xmath1)@xcite and the `` multipole - accelerated resolution of the identity @xmath1 '' ( mari-@xmath1),@xcite which are both implemented in the ridft module of turbomole . the approximations help to reduce the effort to compute the coulomb integrals @xmath1 , which are particularly expensive to evaluate . with the help of the ri-@xmath1 approximation , known also under the name `` density fitting ''",
    ", the four - center - two - electron integrals can be expressed as three - center - two - electron ones.@xcite calculations are faster by a factor of 10 - 100 as compared to standard dft , but equally accurate .",
    "the mari-@xmath1 technique concerns the coulomb interactions between distant atoms .",
    "they are divided into a near - field and a far - field part , where the near field is treated with ri-@xmath1 and the far field by a multipole approximation .",
    "compared to ri-@xmath1 , it can accelerate the calculations by another factor of 2 - 7.@xcite dft requires the choice of an exchange - correlation functional.@xcite we select the generalized - gradient functional bp86,@xcite which is known to yield good results for large metal clusters.@xcite to express the orbital wave functions , gaussian basis sets of split - valence - plus - polarization ( svp ) quality are used,@xcite which are the turbomole standard . within the closed - shell formalism of dft",
    ", total energies of all our clusters are converged to a precision better than @xmath2 a.u . in order to obtain ground - state structures , the total energy needs to be minimized with respect to the nuclear coordinates .",
    "we perform such geometry optimizations or `` relaxations '' until the maximum norm of the cartesian gradient has fallen below @xmath3 a.u .",
    "we compute transport properties of atomic - sized contacts using the landauer - bttiker theory and green s functions expressed in a local , nonorthogonal basis.@xcite the local atomic basis allows us to partition the basis states @xmath4 into left ( @xmath5 ) , central ( @xmath6 ) , and right ( @xmath7 ) ones , according to a division of the contact geometry . in the basis states",

    "[ cap : qtscheme ] we present our procedure .",
    "the goal is to describe the whole atomic - sized contact [ fig .",
    "[ cap : qtscheme](a ) ] consistently , by treating the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 regions with the same basis set and exchange - correlation functional .",
    "we obtain the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 as well as the couplings to the electrodes @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 from the extended central system ( ecc ) [ fig .",
    "[ cap : qtscheme](b ) ] , in which we include large parts of the tips of the metallic electrodes .",
    "the division of the ecc into the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 regions is performed so that the @xmath6 region is identical to that in fig .",
    "[ cap : qtscheme](a ) .",
    "the atoms in the @xmath5 and @xmath7 parts of the ecc [ blue - shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ cap : qtscheme](a ) ] correspond to that part of the electrodes that is assumed to couple to @xmath6 .",
    "the partitioning or division of the ecc is commonly made somewhere in the middle of the metal tips , and we will also refer to it as  \" cut  \" .",
    "the electrodes [ @xmath5 and @xmath7 regions in fig .",
    "[ cap : qtscheme](a ) ] are modeled as surfaces of semi - infinite crystals , described by the surface green s functions @xmath27 .",
    "they are constructed from bulk parameters , extracted from large metal clusters .",
    "further below we discuss in detail , how this is accomplished .    in our approach , we assume the metal tips included in the ecc to be large enough to satisfy basically two criteria . first , all the charge transfer between the @xmath5 and @xmath7 electrodes and the @xmath6 part of the contact should be accounted for . this ensures the proper alignment of the electronic levels in @xmath6 with @xmath19 .",
    "second , most of the metal tips , especially the @xmath5 and @xmath7 parts of the ecc , should resemble bulk as closely as possible . in this way",
    ", we can evaluate the surface green s functions by using bulk parameters of an infinitely extended crystal . owing to surface effects caused by the finite size of the ecc , this",
    "can be satisfied only approximately .",
    "the mismatch between the parameters in the @xmath5 and @xmath7 regions of the contact and the ecc will thus lead to spurious scattering at the @xmath45 and @xmath46 interfaces . in principle",
    "this resistance can be eliminated systematically by including more atoms in the metal tips of the ecc . on the other hand ,",
    "if the resistance in the @xmath6 region is much larger than the spurious @xmath45 and @xmath46 interface resistances , they will have little influence on the results .",
    "we extract bulk parameters describing perfect crystals from large metal clusters . the complete procedure , which aims at determining the surface green s functions @xmath27 with @xmath44 is summarized in fig .",
    "in this work we study exclusively electrode materials with an fcc structure , of which au and al are examples .    in a first step [ fig .",
    "( a ) ] we construct spherical metal clusters , henceforth called `` spheres '' .",
    "they are made up of atoms at positions @xmath47 with the standard fcc primitive lattice vectors @xmath48 and the sphere radius @xmath49 . here , we will use the vector of integer indices @xmath50 to characterize the atomic position @xmath51 .",
    "we do not relax the spheres , but set the lattice constant @xmath52 to its experimental literature value.@xcite increasing the radius @xmath49 should make the electronic structure in the center resemble that of a crystal . from the clusters we extract the overlap and hamiltonian between the central atom at position @xmath53 and the neighboring ones at position @xmath54 ( including @xmath55 ) .",
    "this yields the matrix elements @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath8 and @xmath58 stand for the basis functions of the atoms at @xmath54 and @xmath53 . for reasons of brevity , we will often suppress the orbital indices . @xmath59 and @xmath60 are then matrices with appropriate dimensions .",
    "the bulk parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 need to satisfy the symmetries of the fcc space - group [ fig .",
    "while @xmath59 depends only on the relative position of atoms , surface effects due to the finite size of the fcc clusters lead to deviations from the translational symmetry for @xmath60 .",
    "a rotation may still be necessary to arrive at parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 , which are adapted to the orientation of the electrode @xmath44 [ fig .",
    "details on the symmetrization procedure and the transformation of crystal parameters under rotations are presented in app .",
    "[ sec : electrodedft - electrode - description ] .",
    "the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 are finally employed to construct the semi - infinite crystals and to obtain the surface green s function @xmath27 [ fig .",
    "( d ) ] . due to the finite range of the couplings @xmath42 , @xmath43 , we need to determine @xmath27 for the first few surface layers only [ blue - shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ cap : qtscheme](a ) ] .",
    "we compute these with the help of the decimation technique of ref .  , which we have generalized to deal with the nonorthogonal basis sets.@xcite the parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 can be computed once for a given metal and",
    "can then be used in transport calculations with electrodes of various spatial orientations .",
    "for au ( @xmath65  ) we have analyzed spheres ranging between 13 and 429 atoms , while for al ( @xmath66  ) they vary between 13 and 555 atoms . since we want to describe bulk , the parameters extracted from the largest clusters will obviously provide the best description .",
    "there is , however , an additional criterion , which necessitates the use of large metal clusters for a reliable description of the electrodes . as discussed in app .  [ sub : electrodedft - sizerequire ] , it is based on the positive - semidefiniteness of the bulk overlap matrix .",
    "we find a strong violation of this criterion , if the extraction of parameters is performed such that only the couplings of the cental atom to its nearest neighbors are considered . as a further demonstration of the quality of our description",
    ", we show in app .",
    "[ sub : dft - dos ] the convergence of the dos with respect to @xmath49 .    for the transport calculations we need a value for the fermi energy .",
    "the biggest au and al spheres computed , au@xmath67 and al@xmath68 , respectively , are very metallic",
    ". they exhibit differences between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of less than @xmath69 ev .",
    "therefore we set @xmath19 midway between these energies . in this way",
    "we obtain @xmath70 ev for au and @xmath71 ev for al .",
    "the values will be used in all the results below . notice that the negative values of @xmath19 agree well with experimental work functions of @xmath72 to @xmath73 ev for au and @xmath74 to @xmath75 ev for al.@xcite",
    "in this chapter we explore the conduction properties of metallic atomic contacts of au and al .",
    "these systems , in particular atomic - sized au contacts , have been studied in detail both experimentally and theoretically , and can therefore be used to test our method .",
    "we start by discussing the transport properties of the au contacts , consisting of a four - atom chain , a three - atom chain , and a two - atom chain or `` dimer '' .",
    "since al does not form such chains , we consider only a single - atom contact . for all systems we analyze the transmission , its channel decomposition , and , in order to obtain knowledge about the conduction mechanism , the ldos for atoms in the narrowest part of the contact .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate the robustness of our transmission curves with respect to different partitionings of the large eccs .",
    "let us first discuss the electronic structure of au , where we display the dos in fig .",
    "[ cap : au - dosau ] .",
    "the fermi energy at @xmath70 ev is located in a fairly structureless , flat region somewhat above the @xmath76 band .",
    "based on the electronic configuration [ xe].@xmath77 of the atom , one might have expected a strong contribution only from the @xmath78 orbitals at @xmath19 .",
    "but , as is visible from fig .",
    "[ cap : au - dosau](b ) , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath76 states all yield comparable contributions . , for example , results from a sum over all the @xmath80 functions of the basis set , and @xmath79 is the sum over the @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 components . ] this signifies that valence orbitals hybridize strongly in the metal .",
    "when an atomic contact of au is in a dimer or atomic chain configuration , a conductance of around @xmath83 is expected from experimental measurements@xcite as well as from theoretical studies.@xcite the analysis shows that this value of the conductance is due to a single , almost fully transparent transmission channel .",
    "it arises dominantly from the @xmath78 orbitals of the noble metal au , since the electronic structure in the narrowest part of the contact resembles more the electronic configuration of the atom.@xcite      despite the consensus that the conductance of atomic chains of au is around @xmath83 , the precise atomic positions play an important role.@xcite therefore it is necessary to construct reference geometries that have been studied with a well - established transport method .",
    "we choose to compare to results obtained with transiesta.@xcite the eccs investigated are shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : au - geosau ] .",
    "the four - atom au chain with electrodes oriented in the [ @xmath84 direction , called au100c4 , corresponds to a contact geometry examined in ref .",

    "the three - atom au chain , au111c3 , is similar to a configuration in fig .",
    "9(d ) of ref .  .",
    "in addition , we study a au dimer contact , au111c2 , where a two - atom chain is forming the narrowest part .",
    "in contrast to au100c4 , for the latter two contacts the electrodes are along the [ @xmath85 direction .",
    "let us briefly explain , how we determine these geometries ( fig .",
    "[ cap : au - geosau ] ) .",

    "the distance between the layers containing four atoms is set to @xmath86   [ fig .",
    "[ cap : au - geosau](a ) ] , as in ref .  .",
    "next we relax the four chain atoms without imposing symmetries , keeping all other atoms fixed . after geometry optimization",
    ", we find that the configuration agrees well with symmetry @xmath87 .",
    "we add two more au layers with 16 and 9 atoms on each side , where the ecc now consists of 162 atoms , and perform a final dft calculation , exploiting the symmetry @xmath87 . as compared to ref .  , all bond distances indicated in fig .",
    "[ cap : au - geosau](a ) agree to within @xmath88  , except for the distance between the central chain atoms , where our distance is shorter by @xmath89  . for au111c3",
    "we proceed similarly to au100c4 [ fig .",
    "[ cap : au - geosau](b ) ] .",
    "we start with two perfect au [ @xmath85 pyramids , set the distance between the au layers with 3 atoms to @xmath90 ,@xcite and cut the pyramid off at the layers containing @xmath91 atoms .",
    "then we add one atom in the middle , relax the three chain atoms , add two layers on each side with 12 and 6 atoms , and perform a calculation in symmetry @xmath92 .",
    "au111c3 consists of 77 atoms in total .",
    "our bond distances agree with those in fig .",
    "9(d ) of ref .",
    "to within @xmath93  .",
    "for au111c2 we include also the first au layer in the geometry optimization process .",
    "the distance between the fixed layers with 6 atoms is @xmath94  .",
    "otherwise the steps are the same as for au111c3 .",
    "the ecc is computed in symmetry @xmath92 and consists of 76 atoms . in the parts excluded from the geometry optimization",

    "hence the @xmath6 region must be long enough . in order to describe well the coupling to the electrode surface ( fig .",
    "[ cap : qtscheme ] ) , it is furthermore necessary to have sufficiently many layers in the @xmath5 and @xmath7 regions .",
