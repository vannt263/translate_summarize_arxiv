    "the semileptonic decay @xmath0 , named @xmath8 decay , has received particular attention due to the relative simplicity of its theoretical description and the large branching fraction .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath8 decay can be factorized as the product of the leptonic and hadronic currents .",
    "this makes it a natural place to study the @xmath9 system in the absence of interactions with other hadrons , and to determine the hadronic transition form factors . in this paper",
    "the analysis is done mainly for two purposes :    \\i ) measure the different @xmath9 resonant and non - resonant amplitudes that contribute to this decay , including _",
    "s_-wave and radially excited _ p_-wave and _ d_-wave components .",
    "accurate measurements of these contributions can provide helpful information for amplitude analyses of _ d_-meson and _ b_-meson decays .",
    "\\ii ) measure the @xmath10 dependent transition form factors in the @xmath8 decay , where @xmath10 is the invariant mass squared of the @xmath11 system .",
    "this can be compared with hadronic model expectations and lattice qcd computations  @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath0 proceeds dominantly through the @xmath6 vector resonance .",
    "high statistics in this decay allow accurate measurements of the @xmath6 resonance parameters . besides this dominant process , both focus and babar have observed an _ s_-wave contribution with a fraction of about 6% in this @xmath8 decay  @xcite . in babar",
    "s parameterization , the @xmath9 _ s_-wave with the isospin of @xmath12 was composed of a non - resonant background term and the @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the _ s_-wave modulus was parameterized as a polynomial dependence on the @xmath9 mass for the non - resonant component and a breit - wigner shape for the @xmath13 .",
    "the phase was parameterized based on measurements of the lass scattering experiment  @xcite .",
    "it was described as a sum of the background term @xmath14 and the @xmath15 term @xmath16 , where the mass dependence of @xmath14 was described by means of an effective range parameterization .",
    "babar used it to fit the data over a @xmath9 invariant mass @xmath17 range up to 1.6 gev/@xmath4 , showing that this parameterization could describe the data well .",
    "in addition , they did a model - independent measurement of the phase variation with @xmath17 , which agreed well with the fit result based on the lass parameterization .",
    "in this paper we use babar s parameterization to describe the _",
    "s_-wave , and performe a model - independent measurement of its phase as well .",
    "another goal of this analysis is to describe the @xmath18 decay in terms of helicity basis form factors that give the @xmath10 dependent amplitudes of the @xmath9 system in any of its possible angular momentum states  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , they are written as linear combinations of vector and axial - vector form factors which are assumed to depend on @xmath10 according to the spectroscopic pole dominance ( spd ) model  @xcite . in this analysis",
    "we present two ways to measure them .",
    "one way is to use the spd model to describe the form factors in the partial wave analysis ( pwa ) framework .",
    "another way is to perform a non - parametric measurement of the @xmath10 dependence of the helicity basis form factors using a weighting technique , free from the spd assumptions .",
    "this study will provide a better understanding of the semileptonic decay dynamics .",
    "the analysis is based on the data sample of 2.93 @xmath19  @xcite collected in @xmath20 annihilations at the @xmath1 peak , which has been accumulated with the besiii detector operated at the double - ring beijing electron - positron collider ( bepcii ) .",
    "the besiii detector  @xcite is designed approximately cylindrically symmetric around the interaction point , covering 93% of the solid angle . starting from its innermost component ,",
    "the besiii detector consists of a 43-layer main drift chamber ( mdc ) , a time - of - flight ( tof ) system with two layers in the barrel region and one layer for each end - cap , and a 6240-cell csi(tl ) crystal electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) with both barrel and end - cap sections .",
    "the barrel components reside within a superconducting solenoidal magnet providing a 1.0  t magnetic field aligned with the beam axis .",
    "finally , a muon chamber ( muc ) consisting of nine layers of resistive plate chambers is incorporated within the return yoke of the magnet . in this analysis ,",
    "the muc information is not used .",
    "the momentum resolution for charged tracks in the mdc is 0.5% for transverse momenta of 1  gev / c .",
    "the mdc also provides specific ionization ( @xmath21 ) measurements for charged particles , with a resolution better than 6% for electrons from bhabha scattering .",
    "the energy resolution for showers in the emc is 2.5% for 1  gev photons .",
    "the time resolution of the tof is 80  ps in the barrel and 110  ps in the endcaps .",
    "a geant4-based detector simulation  @xcite is used to study the detector performance .",
    "the production of the @xmath1 resonance is simulated by the generator kkmc  @xcite , which takes the beam energy spread and the initial - state radiation ( isr ) into account .",
    "the decays of monte - carlo ( mc ) events are generated with evtgen  @xcite .",
    "the final - state radiation ( fsr ) of charged particles is considered with the photos package  @xcite .",
    "two types of mc samples are involved in this analysis :  generic mc \" and  signal mc \" .",
    "generic mc consists of @xmath22 and non-@xmath22 decays of @xmath1 , isr production of low - mass @xmath23 states , and qed and @xmath24 continuum processes .",
    "the effective luminosities of the above mc samples correspond to 5 to 10 times those of the experimental data .",
    "all the known decay modes are generated with the branching fractions taken from the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , while the remaining unknown processes are simulated with lundcharm  @xcite .",
    "signal mc is produced to simulate exclusive @xmath25 decays , where @xmath26 decays to the semileptonic signals uniformly ( named `` phsp signal mc '' ) or with the decay intensity distribution determined by pwa ( named `` pwa signal mc '' ) , while @xmath27 decays inclusively as in generic mc .",
    "we use the technique of tagged @xmath28-meson decays @xcite . at 3.773 gev",
    "annihilation energy @xmath28 mesons are produced in pairs . if a decay of one @xmath28 meson ( `` tagged decay '' ) has been fully reconstructed in an event , then the existence of another @xmath29 decay ( `` signal decay '' ) in the same event is guaranteed .",
    "the tagged decays are reconstructed in the channels with larger branching fractions and lower background levels .",
    "six decay channels are considered : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the event selection consists of several stages : selection and identification of particles ( tracks and electromagnetic showers ) , selection of the tagged decays , and selection of the signal decays @xmath0 . throughout this paper ,",
    "unless explicitly stated otherwise , the charge conjugate is also implied when a decay mode of a specific charge is stated .",
    "good tracks of charged particles are selected by the requirement that the track origin is close to the interaction point ( within 10 cm along the beam axis and within 1 cm in the perpendicular plane ) , and that the polar angle @xmath36 between the track and the beam direction is within the good detector acceptance , @xmath37 .",
    "the photons used for the neutral pion reconstruction are selected as electromagnetic showers with a minimum energy of 25 mev in the barrel region ( @xmath38 ) or 50 mev in the endcaps ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the shower timing measured by the calorimeter has to be within 700  ns after the beam collision .",
    "charged particle identification ( pid ) for pions and kaons is based on the combined measurements of the d@xmath40/d@xmath41 and tof .",
    "hypotheses for the track to be pion or kaon are considered .",

    "the measured values are used to calculate the likelihoods @xmath46 for different particle hypotheses .",
    "the electron candidates have to satisfy the following criteria : @xmath47 ,   @xmath48 . additionally , the emc energy of the electron candidate has to be more than 80% of the track momentum measured in the mdc .",
    "neutral pions are reconstructed from pairs of good photons with an invariant mass in the range @xmath49 mev/@xmath4 and with a @xmath50 value for the 1-c mass constrained kinematic fit of @xmath51 less than 200 .",
    "candidates with both photons from the emc endcap regions are rejected .",
    "neutral @xmath52 candidates are reconstructed with pairs of oppositely charged tracks which are constrained to have a common vertex .",
    "the tracks from the @xmath52 decay are not required to satisfy the good track selection or pid criteria .",
    "assuming the two tracks to be pions , we require they have an invariant mass in the range @xmath53 mev/@xmath4",
    ". the closest approach of the track should be within 20 cm from the interaction point along the beam direction and the polar angle has to satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "appropriate combinations of the charged tracks and photons are formed for the six tagged @xmath54 decay channels .",
    "two variables are calculated for each possible track combination : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the reconstructed energy and momentum of the @xmath54 candidate , and @xmath59 is the beam energy .",
