    "it is well known that a protein can refold to its native structure from denatured state under physiology condition .",

    "an interesting question is about the relationship between @xmath2 and other physical quantities . in this paper , we present a scaling law between radius of gyration and the length of protein chain ( @xmath3 ) by exploiting protein data bank : @xmath4 , which has also been reported by other authors@xcite . through generalizing former flory",

    "this enables us to derive a relation between hydrophobicity and fractal dimension , with good agreement to statistical data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , a scaling law of radius of gyration for proteins under physiological condition is presented . in section iii ,",
    "we deprive our new unified formula based on flory s original theory . in section iv ,",
    "the influence of hydrophobicity on fractal dimension is studied .",
    "section v will be a brief conclusion . in appendix ,",
    "the relation between scaling exponent and hydrophobicity is studied directly , in the same way as section iv .",
    "if neglect minor differences between amino acids , protein can be treated as a homopolymer . according to well - known flory s",
    "theory@xcite , there exists a universal scaling law between radius of gyration and the length of polymer chain .",
    "@xmath5 where exponent @xmath6 depends on solvent condition . under good solvent condition ,",
    "monomers are separated by solvent molecules .",
    "thus we have @xmath7 . under poor solvent condition ,",
    "the chain is highly compressed by solvent pressure .",
    "and @xmath8 is as high as crystals .",
    "however , proteins under physiological condition have their specificity . on one hand , they are compact due to hydrophobic interactions . on the other hand , they are usually not well - packed and contain many cavities inside@xcite",
    ". geometrically , these cavities are a consequence of regular secondary structures in folded proteins . furthermore , they are essential for biological functions , since they can serve as binding sites when contacting to other molecules . therefore , folded proteins should be more compact than polymers in good solvent , and looser than highly compressed polymers in poor solvent , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "this argument is confirmed by statistical study of over 37,000 protein structures from protein data bank ( pdb ) , which yields @xmath10 ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) and agrees with the research of arteca@xcite .",
    "it indicates that proteins in native state are not so compact as crystals , which is a bit different from current popular view@xcite .",
    "by least - quare linear fit.,width=340 ]    the influence of secondary structure is also studied . in fig .",
    "2 , we show statistical data for all-@xmath11 , all-@xmath12 , @xmath13 mixed protein structures ( the fractions of amino acids in secondary structures are larger than @xmath14 ) and unstructured proteins ( the fraction of amino acids in secondary structures is less than @xmath15 ) in pdb . despite their great differences in secondary structure ,",
    "their scaling exponent @xmath6 are all approximate to @xmath16 .",

    "they are both largely apart from @xmath19 . however , as secondary structure is a local characteristic , while scaling exponent @xmath6 mainly depends on over - all topological properties .",

    "to obtain a unified formula for scaling law valid under different solvent conditions , we try to generalize flory s original theory@xcite .",
    "we assume that the chain is made up of n monomers , which are indistinguishable from each other",
    ". then its overall size is mainly determined by two following effects : excluded volume effect that tends to swell the chain , and elastic interaction that tends to shrink the chain .",
    "firstly , the excluded volume effect is a consequence of repulsive interactions between monomers , with energy ( two - body repulsive interaction ) given by@xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is single monomer s volume .",
    "then , we calculate the elastic energy . generally speaking ,",
    "this term is originated from contact interactions between monomers , which include hydrophobic interaction between monomers and solvent molecules , covalent bonds , hydrogen bonds and van der waal s interaction between neighboring monomers , etc .",
    "since we are unable to give an explicit formula , we adopt harmonic approximation to find the dominant part .",
    "let @xmath32 be the real distance between monomers @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then monomer @xmath33 is considered to be in contact with monomer @xmath34 , if @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is some given constant .",
    "let @xmath37 be average distance between any two contact monomers @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath37 is independent to index @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and corresponds to the minimum of potential energy . under harmonic approximation ,",
    "the elastic energy of a chain with @xmath3 monomers is given by @xmath38 where the first factor @xmath39 dues to double counting of monomers . and",
    "@xmath40 is hooke coefficient .",
    "define root - mean - square contact distance ( @xmath41 ) as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is local contact number . @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath41 are supposed to be independent to index @xmath33 , for all monomers are equal in our treatment . on the other hand",
    ", we have @xmath45 so now we can rewrite @xmath46 as @xmath47 as the second term is independent of @xmath2 , it will be omitted in later discussions .",
    "thus , we get @xmath48 in general , the root - mean - square contact distance @xmath41 is a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath49 ) , and depends on compactness of a chain .     for 1ptq ; @xmath50 for 1bfe ; @xmath51 for 1agq ; @xmath52 for 1kx5 ; @xmath53 for 1jj2 . )",
    "the data are obtained by counting the number of amino acids ( @xmath54 ) within different given radius ( @xmath55 ) starting at the geometrical center .",
    "it is clear that there exists a wide self - similarity region between small - scale and large - scale structure , with exponent @xmath56 . beyond this region",
    ", @xmath11 drops to @xmath57 quickly , due to finite chain length.,width=340 ]    as suggested by many authors , the protein can be regarded as a fractal in some extent@xcite . if there exists a self - similarity in number density between small - scale and large - scale structure ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we can write @xmath58 where @xmath11 stands for fractal dimension of a protein s structure . thus the root - mean - square contact distance is obtained as @xmath59 put into eqn.(4 ) , @xmath60 hence , the total energy is given by @xmath61    in above argument , we neglect many other effects@xcite , such as entropy effect ( @xmath62 ) and three - body repulsive interaction ( @xmath63 ) etc .",
    "nevertheless , in the region we are interested ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , it is easily to check that @xmath66 .    in equilibrium state , radius of gyration",
    "can be estimated by minimizing the total energy @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 , we have @xmath69^{1/5 } n^{\\frac{\\alpha+2}{5\\alpha } } \\propto n^{\\frac{\\alpha + 2}{5\\alpha}}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath70    in fig.4 , we can see that classical flory s theory acts as an extreme case in our new formula . in good solvent , polymer becomes loose , and can be modeled as a one - dimensional long chain .",
    "thus @xmath71 , which gives @xmath72 . in poor solvent ,",
    "polymer is highly compressed by solvent pressure , and becomes as well - packed as crystals .",
    "it means @xmath73 , then @xmath8 .    in the case of protein under physiological condition , we have @xmath56 ( fig.3 ) , so @xmath74 .",
    "it suggests that many amino acid residues(@xmath75 ) are distributed at the surface of a protein ; and the interior is not so compact as what having been thought before .",
    "this result is also supported by other researches@xcite .",
    "the blue solid curve is for eqn.(9 ) .",
    "the red squares are for three ideal cases respectively : polymer in good solvent ( @xmath76 ) , protein under physiological condition ( @xmath77 ) and polymer in poor solvent ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the crosses stand for statistical values of exponent @xmath6 for proteins with different hydrophobicity ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "@xmath80 is estimated by least - square linear fitting of uniformly selected statistical data ( proteins with same hydrophobicity within @xmath81 ) from pdb .",
    "data for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , as well as @xmath84 are missing due to inadequate samples.,width=340 ]",
    "above deduction is based on assumption of homopolymer . however , in fact , protein is a heteropolymer made up of twenty different kinds of amino acids .",
    "thus exponent @xmath6 generally depends on the component of the chain , especially its hydrophobicity . to study this effect ,",
    "a simple h - p model is introduced . here",
    "we adopt the category method of kyte and doolittle@xcite .",
    "all amino acids with positive values in k - d method are regarded as hydrophobic ( i , v , l , f , c , m , a , g ) ; while other ones with negative values are regarded as hydrophilic ( t , s , w , y , p , h , e , n , q , d , k , r ) .",
    "the fraction of hydrophobic amino acids in a protein is defined as its hydrophobicity(@xmath79 ) .",
    "then if all amino acids are hydrophilic ( @xmath85 ) , which just corresponds to good solvent condition , the protein will be fully extended with dimension @xmath76 . in this case , constrains arising from covalent bonds are dominant interaction against swelling tendency .",
    "if all amino acids are hydrophobic ( @xmath86 ) , corresponding to poor solvent condition , the protein is highly compressed by solvent pressure and dimension @xmath78 .",
    "strong hydrophobic interactions are balanced by excluded volume effect between amino acid residues .",
    "hydrophobicity distribution of 33901 protein structures in pdb .",
    "data is fitted by a gaussian curve @xmath87.,width=340 ]    for natural proteins , their hydrophobicity has a gaussian - like distribution ( fig.5 ) . in the region",
    "@xmath88 $ ] , scaling exponent is almost unchanged ( fig.4 ) , @xmath74 . for @xmath89 or @xmath90 , the number of natural proteins are quite limited . and their corresponding exponent @xmath6 varies largely . especially for @xmath82 or @xmath83 ,",
    "the proteins can regarded as total hydrophilic or hydrophobic respectively .",
    "these results hint appropriate hydrophobicity is essential to maintain overall structure of a natural protein .    to study how hydrophobicity affects scaling exponnet , we try to theoretically predict @xmath91 $ ] .     illustration for our main idea of studying @xmath92 .",
    "process - correspond to eqn.(10)-(12 ) separately .",
    "process is what we want to study .",
    "however , varying the hydrophobicity of a protein by amino acid mutation is not a chemical process , and hard to grasp .",
    "process is our main assumption : varying the hydrophobicity of a protein is equivalent to varying the polarity of solvent .",
    "process is a real chemical reaction . by adding polar or nonpolar molecules",
    ", we can control the polarity of solvent.,scaledwidth=50.0%,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we record the state of protein - solvent coupled system as @xmath93\\{hydrophobicity of protein , polarity of solvent}@xmath94 . then",
    "two proteins with different hydrophobicity in same water solution are written as @xmath95 here the polarity of water solution is set to zero .",
    "if we know how above two states are changed into one another , we can predict the relation of @xmath92 .",
    "however , above process is connected by amino acid mutation , which is not a chemical reaction and not easy to analyze .",
    "here we adopt an alternative way , which is based on the assumption that varying the hydrophobicity of a protein is equivalent to varying the polarity of solvent . according to biochemistry , the hydrophobicity of a protein",
    "is closely related to the polarity of solvent .",
    "the more polar the solvent is , the more hydrophobic the protein is ; while the less polar the solvent is , the more hydrophilic the protein will be . thus we can assume following two systems are equivalent @xmath96 here , we adopt a linear relationship between hydrophobicity and polarity , and its validity remains to be verified by experiments . from eqn.(10 ) and ( 11 ) , we can turn a physical process - varying hydrophobicity of a chain by amino acid mutation , to a chemical process - varying polarity of solvent by adding polar or nonpolar molecules ( fig.6 ) .",
    "thus , eqn.(10 ) is equivalent to following process @xmath97    now the study on @xmath92 is changed into a chemical reaction .",
    "suppose there are three separated stable thermal states @xmath98 , which represent proteins in good solvent , under physiological condition and in poor solvent respectively .",
    "their corresponding fractal dimensions are @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we start from the state under physiological condition .",
    "when the condition is changed from water solution to good solvent , which can be done by adding nonpoler molecules ( @xmath3 ) , proteins will change from @xmath102 state to @xmath103 state , according to following chemical process @xmath104 here reaction constants @xmath105 and",
