    "whatever stellar atmosphere model was chosen for vy 1 - 2 , we did not fully reproduce the observed properties ( e.g. the ionisation balance of the elements ) to a satisfactory degree .",
    "in particular , the ionisation balance of all the elements is overestimated by the low c abundance model , whilst the higher c abundance model seems to produce an ionisation balances that matches better the observed ones .",

    "we have to stress out though there is no available infrared spectroscopic data for vy  12 and our analysis is based on the results from our best - fitting photo  ionisation model using the broad  band infrared fluxes .    in summary , a careful look at the modelled sed reveals a lower flux in the infrared h  band , indicating that this measurement may be underestimated and the seemingly k - band excess is not really an excess associated with the presence of a cold companion as previously mentioned .",
