    "it is known that sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is a color superconductor .",
    "it is possible that such a state of matter may naturally exist in the universe inside central regions of compact stars .",
    "for this reason , the topic of color superconductivity stirred a lot of interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "( for reviews on color superconductivity see , for example , ref .  @xcite . )",
    "matter in the bulk of stars is electrically neutral and @xmath0 equilibrated .",
    "this means that the chemical potentials of different quarks satisfy some nontrivial relations .",
    "such relations affect the pairing dynamics between quarks , and the ground state of matter is modified .",
    "it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , for example , that a mixture of the two - flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase and unpaired strange quarks is less favorable than the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase when the charge neutrality is enforced .",
    "when the constituent mass of the strange quark is large , neutral two - flavor quark matter in @xmath0 equilibrium can have a ground state called the gapless color superconductor ( g2sc ) @xcite . while the symmetry of the g2sc ground state is the same as that of the conventional two - flavor color superconductor ( 2sc ) , the spectrum of the fermionic quasiparticles is different .",
    "the existence of stable gapless color superconducting phases was confirmed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and generalized to finite temperatures in refs .",
    "it was also shown that a gapless color - flavor - locked ( gcfl ) phase can appear in neutral strange quark matter @xcite .",
    "a nonrelativistic analogue of gapless superconducting phases could appear in trapped gases of cold fermionic atoms @xcite .",
    "( note that a mixed phase can be an alternative ground state in atomic @xcite as well as quark @xcite systems provided the surface tension is small . )    in this paper , we report on the gluon screening properties in neutral dense two - flavor quark matter .",
    "our results cover the gapped as well as the gapless 2sc phases . in the case of the ideal 2sc phase",
    "( i.e. , without a mismatch between the fermi momenta of different quarks ) , our results reproduce the findings of refs .",
    ". the most important result of this paper is the finding of a chromomagnetic type plasma instability in neutral dense quark matter .",
    "we show that there exist five unstable gluon modes in the g2sc phase , and four of them persist even in the gapped phase when the mismatch is larger than a certain critical value .",
    "we argue that this instability may lead to a gluon condensation in dense quark matter .",
    "specific details of the condensate still remain to be clarified .",
    "in the ground state of a two - flavor color superconductor , the gauge symmetry group @xmath1 is broken down to @xmath2 by the anderson - higgs mechanism .",
    "normally , this should lead to a generation of masses for the 5 gluons that correspond to the broken generators .",
    "this would be a standard description of the meissner effect . as we shall see below ,",
    "this is not always the case in dense quark matter .    in order to study the gluon screening properties in the system at hand , we follow an approach similar to that in refs .",

    "the cooper pairing is in conflict with the constraint of charge neutrality . as a result",
    ", the ground state corresponds to the normal phase . at strong diquark coupling , on the other hand , the ground state is in the gapped 2sc phase , and the neutrality plays little effect . in the regime of an intermediate strength of the coupling ,",
    "the ground state is given by the gapless 2sc phase @xcite .    in order to describe the most general situation , we parametrize all the results below with the dimensionless ratio @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mismatch between the fermi momenta of paired quarks which is determined by the neutrality and the @xmath0-equilibrium conditions",

    "@xcite are based on the fact that the ground state corresponds to a local maximum of the effective potential in the system with a fixed mismatch parameter , @xmath58 .",

    "it is important to emphasize that the explicit result for the @xmath62-components of the polarization tensor of the 8th gluon and the _ vacuum _ photon have no mixing at @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this is similar to the ideal 2sc case considered in ref .",
    "( in view of this , one should be careful when interpreting the results for the debye screening masses in a different basis of gauge fields @xcite . )",

    "of course , it also coincides with the mixing angle in the ideal 2sc case in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the absence of a mixing between the electrical modes of the 8th gluon and the vacuum photon in the static limit , see eqs .",
    "( [ m_d_8 ] ) and ( [ m_d_gamma ] ) , is not in conflict with the gauge invariance of the 2sc / g2sc ground state with respect to @xmath60 .",

    "the third , electrical mode of @xmath73 is not massless .",
    "it decouples from the low - energy theory and its presence is irrelevant for the gauge invariance with respect to @xmath60 .",

    "( [ m_m_8 ] ) , the medium modified @xmath76th gluon has a magnetic plasma instability in the gapless 2sc phase .",
    "this is because the meissner screening mass squared is _ negative _ when @xmath56 .",
    "in this paper , we calculated the debye and meissner screening masses of the gluons and the photon in the case of neutral , @xmath0-equilibrated dense two - flavor quark matter ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - masses ] ) .",
    "our results interpolate between the known values in the normal phase @xcite and in the ideal 2sc phase @xcite of quark matter .",
    "the meissner screening properties of dense matter are most interesting .",
    "we find that there is a chromomagnetic plasma type instability in quark matter @xcite .",
    "this is driven by 5 unstable gluon modes ( @xmath77 ) in the g2sc phase ( @xmath56 ) , and by 4 modes ( @xmath42 ) in the gapped 2sc phase when @xmath57 .",
    "one could connect the instability from the @xmath76th gluon to a large density of gapless states in the g2sc phase .",
    "this might be related to the mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "the other 4 unstable modes have no obvious connection with the existence of the g2sc phase because they lead to an instability even in the gapped phase .",
    "it is natural to assume that the instability , indicated by the negative values of the meissner screening masses squared , will resolve in some type of a gluon condensation . indeed , the result @xmath78 suggests that the system stays in a false vacuum that corresponds to a local maximum of the effective potential for the gluon field .",
    "then , the true vacuum is most likely given by the global minimum of the potential that corresponds to a nonzero expectation value of a gluon field , i.e. , @xmath79 for @xmath80 or for @xmath43 , depending on which instability develops first .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that the true ground state has a condensate that breaks the rotational symmetry of the system .",
    "in fact , this would be the most natural outcome of a gluon condensation because it is the magnetic components of gluons @xmath81 that drive the instability .",
    "one might even speculate @xcite that the mechanism is similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in passing , we note that the gluon type instability , indicated by negative values of the meissner screening masses squared , is not directly related to the so - called sarma instability @xcite . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sarma instability in the effective potential for the order parameter is removed when the neutrality condition is imposed .",
    "the nature of the instability observed here may resemble the instability in anisotropic models of refs .",
    "@xcite used for describing the initial stage of heavy ion collisions . however , the origins of the two instabilities are very different .",
    "in contrast to the situation in refs .",
    "@xcite , the quark distribution functions are completely isotropic in momentum space in neutral dense quark matter .    in the future",
    ", it would be very interesting to investigate whether a similar instability develops in the gcfl phase @xcite , where the low - energy quasiparticle spectrum resembles the spectrum in the g2sc phase .",
