    "gravitational lenses are a powerful tool to study not only the structure of the lensed quasar but also the composition of the lens galaxy @xcite .",
    "simple lens models are usually sufficient to reproduce the positions of lensed qso images , but they can fail to reproduce the optical fluxes of these images .",
    "the so - called flux ratio anomalies are thought to be produced by small - scale structures in the gravitational potential of lens galaxies @xcite .",
    "these structures are either dark matter subhalos or stars and the effects they produce are referred to as millilensing and microlensing respectively .",
    "a substructure is able to produce a flux anomaly if the radius of its einstein ring is large compared to the emitting region .",
    "since the sizes of the quasar continuum emitting regions depend on the wavelength , microlensing by stars in a lens galaxy will yield a wavelength - dependent magnification of the continuum @xcite that can be strong for the uv and the optical but is negligible for the ir .",
    "microlensing could also affect the high ionization broad emission lines ( bel ) that are expected to arise from the inner part of the broad - line region ( blr ) . specifically",
    ", microlensing would affect the broad wings of the profiles of the high ionization lines that correspond to high velocity emitters , leaving unchanged the core @xcite .",
    "low ionization bel and narrow emission lines ( nel ) arise from considerably larger regions and are supposed to be insensitive to microlensing @xcite although the low ionization bel of some low - luminosity lensed agns may be slightly affected by microlensing .",
    "observational studies aimed at measuring the microlensing effect in lensed qsos usually consist of broadband observations repeated over extended periods , longer than the time delays for image pairs @xcite , leading to several years of monitoring .    on the other hand ,",
    "most of the microlensing searches using optical imaging have been concentrated on quadruple lenses because the effect of substructure is more important at high magnification @xcite .",
    "they provide enough constraints to fit the simplest singular isothermal ( sis ) model @xcite and find the flux anomalies .",
    "double lenses , however , do not provide enough constraints to produce such a model unless the fluxes are used as additional constraints . in these cases ,",
    "the flux ratio of emission lines @xcite or in the infrared @xcite has been used assuming that the emission regions are larger than the microlensing source and dust extinction is negligible .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use spectra of lensed quasars as an alternative approach to photometric monitoring , to study microlensing in quadruple or double lenses . for each pair of images of a lensed quasar ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , we base our analysis on the measurement of the offsets of the flux ratio of the core of the emission lines @xmath12 compared to the flux ratio of the continuum @xmath13 .",
    "this analysis allows us to distinguish between microlensing and dust extinction without assuming a model for the lensed system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in this way , a single - epoch spectroscopic observation can suffice through the measurement of microlensing to estimate physical parameters of interest of the lens galaxy ( like the fraction of mass in compact objects , mediavilla et al .",
    "2009 ) or of the unresolved quasar source ( like the size or the radial temperature profile ) .",
    "in section 2 we present the data for 5 gravitationally - lensed quasars with multiple images for which we have obtained low - resolution spectra with signal - to - noise greater than 40 .",
    "the systems , hs0818 + 1227 , q0957 + 561 , sdss1004 + 4112 , sdss1029 + 2623 , and he1104 - 1805 , were selected because the separations between the images were larger than 3@xmath14 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to present the data analysis methodology .",
    "we discuss our results in  4 and give some concluding remarks in section  5 .",
    "microlensing detection using spectra of lensed qsos has stringent requirements .",
    "first of all , we need high signal - to - noise ratio in the spectra ( @xmath15 ) and sufficient spectral resolution ( @xmath16 km s@xmath17 ) to resolve the shape of the line profiles .",
    "second , we need to obtain simultaneous , spatially - separated spectra of pairs of lensed qso images to compare their continuum and emission lines at different wavelengths , which requires good seeing conditions ( @xmath18 ) . these requirements are achieved using 6 - 8 m class telescopes under good seeing conditions .",
    "we observed the sample on 11 and 12 january 2008 with the blue channel spectrograph on the mmt .",
    "table [ obs ] shows the log of observations .",
    "we also observed he1104 - 1805 on 07 april 2008 with the fors2 spectrograph at the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "our ground - based observations were acquired under excellent atmospheric conditions ( table [ obs ] ) . for q0957 + 561 , we used archival data obtained with the stis spectrograph on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . components @xmath10 and @xmath11 were observed with hst at different epochs to account for time delay variations in the continuum spectra ( see table [ obs ] ) .",
    "a detailed description of these observations and the spectrum analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "we performed the data reduction with iraf tasks .",
    "these included bias subtraction , flat fielding , extraction of 1-d spectra and wavelength calibration .",
    "as we are currently interested only in flux ratios ( i.e. magnitude difference @xmath19 ) , we did not flux - calibrate our data .",
    "cosmic - ray rejection was carried out in those cases where we had at least three exposures .",
    "the data obtained from the hst archive are already fully reduced .    in spite of the careful data reduction process",
    ", some systematic errors can affect our measurements .",
    "we discuss these in the following paragraphs .      to avoid cross - contamination between the spectra of lensed qso image pairs we selected pairs with separation much wider than the average seeing ( @xmath20 ) , which was larger in turn than our typical seeing .",
    "our pairs have separations ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 as shown in table [ obs ] ; we estimate that cross - contamination is negligible in our observations .      to obtain simultaneous pairs of spectra with a single slit",
    ", we did not observe our targets at the parallactic angle ; in each case we used the position angle defined by the two components . in these ground - based observations",
    ", we lost a small amount of the blue part of the spectra because part of the blue quasar light may fall outside the slit .",
    "our airmass range was @xmath23 ; we used a @xmath24 slit width .",
    "we used a program developed by e. marchetti at eso to calculate the differential atmospheric refraction ( dar ) for each given wavelength and airmass .",
    "the atmospheric parameters ( temperature , humidity , and pressure ) we used are @xmath25 @xmath26c , @xmath27 % , @xmath28 mbar for vlt and @xmath29 @xmath26c , @xmath30 % , @xmath31 mbar for mmt .",
    "the focus for fors2 is set at 5000  which is our reference wavelength to calculate the displacement due to dar .",
    "we estimated the relative loss in the flux of each pair of images at 3500  and 8000  , and at 4500  and 9500  for the mmt and vlt data respectively .",
    "we found relative losses of @xmath32% in all mmt spectra ; for the vlt spectra , we found losses of @xmath33% due to an error in the position angle used in the observations .",
    "considering the separation between pairs of images ( @xmath21 to @xmath22 ) , the losses are nearly identical for both spectra in each case , and as we are concerned with flux ratio changes with wavelength , those losses do not affect our results .",
    "the method we use to untangle microlensing and extinction is based on the measurement of the offsets between the continuum and the emission line flux ratios ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the multicomponent nature of quasar emission - lines imply that the emission - line spectra are produced over a wide range of distances from the central continuum ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "according to @xcite the low ionization lines ( lil ) and the core of the high ionization lines ( hil ) will be dominated by a component ( fwhm @xmath34 ) that corresponds to the region of reverberation mapping typically large enough as to be insensitive to microlensing by solar mass objects .",
    "the broad wings of the emission lines ( fwhm @xmath35 ) , however , could arise from the inner parts of the blr and may be microlensed .",
    "for this reason , we prefer to use exclusively the line cores ( dominated by the nlr and the outer regions of the blr ) as reference to set the baseline for no microlensing . to compute the core flux without attempting an analytical decomposition into several components @xcite",
    ", we have used a narrow band decomposition similar to that used by @xcite .",
    "specifically , we define as core flux the continuum subtracted flux integrated in a relatively narrow velocity interval ( from 25 to 90    depending on the line profile shape for the different sources ) centered on the peak of the line . to accommodate the varying widths of the lines ,",
    "the continuum estimate for each line requires windows with varying width as indicated below for each lens system .",
    "for each component and each emission line we used dipso @xcite in starlink to fit a function @xmath36 to the continuum on either side of the emission line , given a total wavelength range ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "the task also gives the error coefficients ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) in the continuum fitting .",
    "this error is largest in the bluest and reddest ends of the continuum , because it is affected by the response of the ccd .",
    "the flux under the continuum is then obtained as the integral below the fitted function @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 . the error in the flux is estimated as @xmath43 .",
    "the emission line flux is obtained by integrating the emission line profiles in each continuum - subtracted emission line using dipso .",
    "as commented above , we have separated the line core from the wings which could be affected by microlensing . the error in the narrow emission line",
    "is estimated as the error in the continuum fitting . in those cases in which the emission line is affected by absorption lines ,",
    "a narrower integration window was chosen ( 10 to 15    in the case of sdss1029 + 2623 ) . in most of the cases in which these absorptions are mild , they can be successfully avoided . however ,",
    "when the absorptions are broad and affect the central part of the emission lines ( e.g. sdss1029 + 2623 ) the measurements have correspondingly larger uncertainties .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that , depending on the structure of the blr , microlensing could modify the broad line profiles . @xcite",
    "have estimated which gravitational lens systems are more likely to show blr changes due to microlensing .",
    "some examples of these variations in the blr have been presented by @xcite in the cases of mg0414 + 0534 , h1413 + 117 , sdss1004 + 4112 , and q2237 + 0305 .",
    "superposition of the spectra for each image pair ( see figures 1 , 6 , 7 , 11 , 13 , and 16 ) shows excellent matches between the emission lines profiles of",
    "he1104 - 1805 , sdss1029 + 2623 , q0957 + 561 and hs0818 + 1227 . significant microlensing of bels is detected only in the wings of one of the systems , sdss1004 + 4112 ( see  [ sdss1004 ] ) .",
    "a slight enhancement of the red wings that may be tentatively related to microlensing has been also detected in he1104 - 1805 ( see  [ he1104 ] ) .",
    "thus , the impact of microlensing on the bel looks negligible except in sdss1004 + 4112 .",
    "the excellent matches between the emission line profiles for each image pair imply that , except for fluctuations due to absorptions or noise , the choice of the size of the line core has no impact on the results .",
    "to show this explicitly , we have compared the a - b magnitudes ( averaged on all the lines for each system ) computed using only the line core or the whole line ( as estimated from the factor used to match the line profiles ) .",
    "we find differences of @xmath44=0.02 , 0.03 , 0.01 , and 0.06 for he1104 , sdss1029 , qso0957 , and he0818 , respectively .",
    "thus , we find that for all the systems except sdss1004 + 4112 the a - b emission line ratios do not significantly depend on the choice of the core width . in any case",
    ", we have used the core of the emission lines exclusively to estimate the emission line flux ratios ( see section [ mulens ] ) .      for those cases in which chromatic microlensing is detected",

    "we consider a range of 1 to 15 light - days ( @xmath57 ) for @xmath55 and a range of 0 to 3 for @xmath56 . in  [ results ] we will apply this method to sdss1004 + 4112 and he1104 - 1805 .",

    "each lensed qso image follows a different path through the lens galaxy , encountering different amounts of dust and gas that produce differential extinction . @xcite",
    "measured the mean differential extinction , @xmath59 , in 23 lens galaxies using hst broad - band filters .",
    "this extinction can affect not only the continuum flux ratio but also the emission - line fluxes @xcite .",
    "thus , considering that the cores of the emission lines are affected neither by microlensing nor by intrinsic variability , measuring the emission lines flux ratio in several wavelengths provides us with a method to determine the existence of dust extinction in the system .",
    "we fitted the extinction curve to the magnitude difference in emission lines for images 1 and 2 using the equation @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the constant magnification ratio , @xmath62 is the extinction difference , and @xmath63 $ ] is the extinction curve in the lens rest frame .",
    "we minimized @xmath64 per number of degree of freedom ( @xmath65 ) . in the majority of the systems",
    "( except q0957 + 561 ) we have only a few narrow emission lines in the optical part of the spectra .",
    "we make our estimates with the @xcite extinction curve of the milky way ( i.e. we fixed the parameter @xmath66 ) at the redshift of the lens galaxy . as is standard and to facilitate comparison of our results with those of other authors , magnitude differences are shown as a function of inverse wavelength in microns in the lens galaxy rest frame .",
    "there are two effects , intrinsic variability and contamination by the lens galaxy , that can produce chromatic variations in the flux of lensed qsos and , hence , mimic microlensing .",
    "the continuum flux variation in qsos is a well - know effect that does not significantly affect the nel fluxes @xcite .",
    "intrinsic continuum variability combined with the time delay between images can produce a change in the flux ratios between images that can be wavelength dependent , thus inducing changes in the chromaticity .",
    "these changes should be avoided if possible or at least estimated . in two of the objects , q0957 + 561 and he1104 - 1805 we can use data taken at two different epochs separated by the time delay to avoid the problem of intrinsic variability .    in all the objects , we can estimate the effects of intrinsic variability ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the structure function inferred from the sdss imaging data of quasars @xcite .",
    "we will consider the less favorable case ; an intrinsic magnitude of @xmath67 for the quasar @xcite , the bluest photometric band to measure variability and the two bands with the largest separation in wavelength to estimate the chromaticity variation .",
    "in the case of sdss1004 + 4112a , b with a measured time - delay of about 40 days , the expected intrinsic variability is @xmath68 mag and the chromaticity change is @xmath69 mag . for he1104 - 1805 with a measured time delay of about 150 days and for hs0818 + 1227 with a comparable theoretical delay , variability of @xmath70 mag and chromaticity change @xmath71 mag are predicted .",
    "finally , for the largest separation systems , q0957 + 561 and sdss1029 + 2623 , variability of @xmath72 mag and chromaticity change of @xmath73 mag are expected .",
    "thus , changes in chromaticity , that are most significant to study the quasar structure , are rather small .",
    "the expected values of the intrinsic variability are in reasonable agreement with the analysis of lightcurves for q0957 + 561 @xcite , sdss1004 + 4112 @xcite and he1104 - 1805 @xcite . in the case of he1104 - 1805",
    ", @xcite specifically studied the effect of intrinsic variability on flux ratios finding a global displacement of 0.1 mag in magnitude differences due to the time delay without apparent changes in chromaticity in the optical ( from the j to b photometric bands ) .    in summary ,",
    "we used photometry corrected for known time delays to avoid the effects induced by intrinsic variability in q0957 + 561 and he1104 - 1805 .",
    "these effects are within the uncertainties for sdss1004 + 4112 and , likely , for hs0818 + 1227 ( although we lack on a measured time delay for this object ) .",
    "finally , sdss1029 + 2623 can potentially have relatively strong effects ( @xmath70 mag change in chromaticity ) induced by intrinsic variability .    on the other hand , in the cases of hs0818 + 1227 and q0957 + 561",
    "the lens galaxy is bright and very close to one of the components on the sky ( @xmath74 and @xmath24 respectively ) and some of the spectra may suffer contamination from the continuum of the lens galaxy . this continuum contamination is stronger at longer wavelengths , but it does not affect the emission line fluxes . in these two cases , to avoid the continuum flux contamination we have considered the broad - band flux ratio obtained by castles using hst imaging , in which the lens galaxy was modeled and subtracted .",
    "sdss1004 + 4112 is a five - image lens system at @xmath75 discovered by @xcite with distances between components ranging from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",

    "richards ) . while the @xmath11 component and the red part of the a component are basically the same in both epochs , the blue wing enhancement of component @xmath10 is significantly smaller in 2008 .",
    "this variability is the kind of gradual change in the line profile expected from microlensing . according to  [ mulens ] ,",
    "in what follows we will use the cores of the emission lines to compute flux ratios avoiding the effects of microlensing in the blue wings .",

    "thus , microlensing in he1104 - 1805 has induced an extreme change in continuum slope that needs explanation .",
    "the chromaticity during the 1992 - 1994 epoch with an increasing amplitude towards the blue leads to an straightforward interpretation in terms of the magnification of the dominant component @xmath10 . to explain the slope of the continuum corresponding to 2006 - 2008 epoch ( under common assumptions about the unresolved source structure ) we need to combine chromatic microlensing in both @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "for instance , we can consider the combination of two events of magnification in both @xmath10 and @xmath11 with a progressive increase in the strength of the @xmath11 event from 1994 to 2008 .",
    "this is only a qualitative example and simulations are needed to consistently reproduce microlensing chromaticity in each of the two epochs .    following the procedure described in section [ disk - size ] we have used the detected microlensing chromaticity to study the structure of the accretion disk in he1104 - 1805 .",
    "we have done this for three sets of data : our vlt continuum data from 2008 , the @xcite data corrected for time delay and the average of the data from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that consistently follow a common trend with wavelength . in table [ map_he1104 ] we present the microlensing measurements for each dataset . to compute the microlensing maps we have used the following projected densities and shears for each lens image ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) and ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) according to @xcite",
    "the resulting pdfs are plotted in figure [ he1104size ] , and the expected values and uncertainties in table [ pdfs_he1104 ] .",
    "the pdfs corresponding to the mmt / vlt ( fig.[he1104size]a ) and to the @xcite data ( fig.[he1104size]c ) are not as concentrated near the maximum of the pdf as in the case of the broad - band data ( fig [ he1104size]b ) .",
    "these pdfs may present a secondary maximum ( perhaps due to the complexity of the microlensing phenomenon corresponding to this epoch ) and , individually considered , are not very conclusive .",
    "however , the product pdf strongly increases the concentration of the probability near the maximum and the significance of the estimates : @xmath131 ) , @xmath7 for the linear prior and @xmath132 ) , @xmath7 for the logarithmic prior .",
    "our @xmath55 estimates correspond to one half light radius at the central wavelength of b filter , @xmath133 ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the results obtained by @xcite with hst data and by @xcite from photometric monitoring .",
    "the values of @xmath56 are , however , considerably smaller .",
    "the microlensing - based size estimates are significantly larger than those inferred from the black - hole mass or from the observed i - band flux ( see * ? ? ?",
    "sdss1029 + 2623 was discovered by @xcite ; it consists of two images @xmath10 and @xmath11 separated by @xmath134 at @xmath135 and a cluster lens galaxies at @xmath136 .",
    "recently @xcite found a third image @xmath81 @xmath137 from @xmath11 and several complex absorption systems in the emission lines .",
    "although the emission line profiles are similar for @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( figure [ prof2_sdss1029 ] ) , there are several groups of absorption line systems affecting ly@xmath84 and civ that are associated with mgi / mgii / feii absorption systems , as found by @xcite .",
    "there are also self - absorption systems associated with ly@xmath84 , siiv , and civ lines that are present in both components but with significant differences . in spite of this",
    "we have attempted to determine flux ratios by defining suitable integration windows to avoid the absorptions . in the case of ciii ] , the emission line profiles are almost identical in both components and show no absorption lines .",
    "thus , the results derived from ciii ] should be more reliable than the results inferred from the other lines .",
    "the @xmath118 magnitude differences obtained from our data ( continuum and emission lines ) compared to those obtained by @xcite and @xcite are shown in figure [ diff_sdss1029a ] ( table  [ mag_sdss1029 ] ) .",
    "our continuum flux ratio agrees well with the data corresponding to the @xmath138 and @xmath139 broadband filters from @xcite that were taken with the keck at the same epoch .",
    "however , there is a difference of @xmath70 mag with the data taken at other epochs .",
    "this is explained by variability in the continuum between 2007 and 2008 ( another peculiar feature is that the measurement in the @xmath140 band @xcite is @xmath141 mag above all the other broad - band measurements ) . in principle",
    "the variability could be attributed to microlensing or intrinsic variability of the quasar continuum combined with a time lag between both components .",
    "however , the strong chromaticity of the continuum flux ratio ( of about 0.4 mag ) that exceeds the @xmath70 mag global offset between continuum flux ratios at different epochs excludes the explanation based on intrinsic continuum variability .",
    "dust extinction , on the other hand , can not explain the chromaticity for the flux ratio inferred from radio observations agrees with the flux ratio of the bluest continuum contrary to the expectations under this hypothesis .",
    "thus , microlensing is the more likely explanation and is supported by the agreement of the flux ratios inferred from three of the lines , civ , siiv , and ly@xmath84 with the radio flux ratio .",
    "however , the flux ratio inferred from the other emission line , ciii ] which presents the smoothest line profile , shows a large offset with respect to the baseline defined by the radio data that disagrees with the microlensing hypothesis . under the hypothesis of chromatic microlensing",
    "we could follow the same steps as in the case of sdss1004 + 4112 to estimate the size and temperature profile of the quasar source in sdss1029 + 2623 .",
    "however , lens modeling in this system is complex ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and we defer this study to future work .",
    "the first known gravitational lens was discovered by @xcite ; it has been studied in great detail .",
    "it consists of two images @xmath10 and @xmath11 with separation @xmath142 .",

    "comparison between @xmath10 and @xmath11 emission lines ( figure [ prof2_q0957 ] ) do not show significant differences between the emission line profiles of civ , ciii ] and mgii .",
    "this limits the possible impact of microlensing on the broad component of the emission lines . to quantify this impact",
    "we have compared the @xmath145 flux ratios of the wings and the core of the civ emission line ( that has the highest s / n ratio ) finding differences @xmath14610% . in any case",
    "we have computed flux ratios from the cores of the lines .",
    "figure [ diff_q0957a ] ( see also table [ mag_q0957 ] ) shows the @xmath118 magnitude differences in the continuum and in the emission lines for q0957 + 561 .",
    "this figure also includes other data from the literature and a re - analysis of hst / stis data by @xcite . averaging the radio data from @xcite at @xmath147 , @xcite at @xmath148 , and @xcite at @xmath147 , the @xmath118 magnitude difference uncontaminated by the lens galaxy continuum and free from dust extinction",
    "is obtained , @xmath149  mag .",
    "the @xmath118 magnitude differences corresponding to the emission lines follow a decreasing trend towards the blue compatible with extinction .",
    "a linear fit to the emission line magnitude differences ( see figure [ diff_q0957b ] ) has a slope of @xmath150 and a dispersion of 0.09  mag .",
    "this dispersion is reasonable taking into account the intrinsic difficulty and the inhomogeneity of the data analysis procedures followed by the different authors especially regarding the criteria used to select the continuum . towards the red",
    "this linear fit is fully consistent with the @xmath118 radio measurements , confirming that the emission lines are not significantly affected by microlensing .",
    "in figure [ diff_q0957b ] we also present an extinction curve fit to the @xmath118 emission line magnitude differences ( both from the literature and from our own measurements ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters ( obtained fixing the dust redshift to the lens redshift ) were : @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) the data are also compatible with an extinction curve similar to the milky way ( @xmath151 , @xmath154 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the fitting to the narrow emission lines is in agreement with other data obtained from the continuum @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "however our results are not in agreement with the values @xmath156 and @xmath157 found by @xcite .",
    "the continuum data also show a decreasing trend towards the blue with a slightly steeper slope ( @xmath158 for castles and @xmath159 for hst / stis ) .",
    "in fact , the same extinction curve fitted to the emission line data with a shift of @xmath160 fits well the continuum flux ratios from castles and hst / stis ( notice that these continuum flux ratios obtained from hst data are not affected by lens galaxy contamination ) . this global shift between the continuum and the baseline of no microlensing magnification defined by the emission lines",
    "imply that the continuum is experimenting microlensing of @xmath161 and allows us to re - examine the microlensing history in q0957 + 561 based in this result .",
    "the differential @xmath118 magnitude lightcurve of q0957 + 561 @xcite can be described as an event of 0.25  mag taking place from 1981 to 1986 and a quiet phase of mean value @xmath162  mag with fluctuations of less than 0.05  mag from 1987 to 1999 ( oscoz et al .",
    "previous attempts to model the observed microlensing through simulations have not used the emission line flux ratios as microlensing zeropoint .",
    "these studies have either accepted any zeropoint for microlensing magnification , modeling microlensing variability of less than 0.05 mag with respect to an unrestricted zeropoint value ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or implicitly supposed that the zeropoint was placed at the mean value of the quiet phase ( @xmath162  mag ) modeling a microlensing amplitude of less than 0.05  mag ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , considering the zeropoint defined by the emission line flux ratios the correct procedure will be to model fluctuations of 0.05  mag with respect to a mean microlensing amplitude of @xmath163 .",
    "although detailed microlensing simulations should be made to estimate physical parameters from the source and/or the microlenses , it seems that under this new perspective the likelihood of smaller sources ( or bigger microdeflectors ) will increase .",
    "on the other hand , there is an offset of @xmath164 mag between the magnitude differences in the continuum obtained with the mmt and those obtained with hst / stis ( data obtained at different epochs to correct for time delay ) .",
    "this difference between mmt and hst / stis data might be explained by ( i ) intrinsic variability ( ii ) a microlensing amplitude change , and ( iii ) continuum contamination by the lens galaxy .",
    "we plan to examine available photometric monitoring of q0957 + 561 covering 2008 ( phased by the lag associated with component @xmath11 ) to ascertain the origin of this offset .",
    "if we compare the slopes of the linear fits corresponding to emission lines and continua ( castles plus hst / stis data ) we found that the @xmath118 offsets at mgii and at ovi wavelengths have a difference of @xmath165  mag , these may be due to a wavelength dependence of microlensing ( chromatic microlensing ) .",
    "this estimate is , however , greatly affected by the uncertainties in the determination of the emission line flux ratios .    in summary , for q0957 + 561 our results",
    "indicate that : ( i ) there is no significant variation in the broad component of the emission line profiles , ( ii ) there is dust extinction affecting the emission lines and the continuum produced by dust likely at the same redshift as the lens galaxy and ( iii ) there is microlensing with amplitude @xmath166 affecting the continuum .",
    "hs0818 + 1227 was discovered by @xcite ; it consists of two lensed images @xmath10 , @xmath11 separated by @xmath167 , with @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "image @xmath11 in this case is @xmath170 mag fainter than @xmath10 .",
    "we scaled the continuum - subtracted @xmath11 spectrum to match the emission line peaks in a ( figure [ prof2_hs0818 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 emission line profiles are very similar to each other and do not show significant differences in the blr .",
    "figure [ diff_hs0818a ] shows the @xmath118 magnitude differences we calculated from the continuum ( solid black squares ) and from the cores of the emission - lines ( solid black triangles ) integrating our mmt spectra .",
    "the @xmath118 magnitude differences corresponding to the narrow emission lines ( table [ mag_hs0818 ] ) will define a zero microlensing baseline of @xmath171  mag .",
    "the average of castles broadband data ( @xmath172  mag ) shows an offset of 0.22  mag with respect to this baseline .",
    "note , however that the significance of this offset is dominated by the f555w data taken by castles . according",
    "to section 3.5 , part of this offset ( 0.1 mag ) may arise from intrinsic variability .",
    "our continuum data agree with @xcite , but do not match castles ( table [ lit ] ) , especially in the reddest part .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the lens galaxy continuum .",
    "we estimate , using the integrated broad - band magnitudes obtained by castles for the lens galaxy , that the contamination is @xmath173 % of the lens galaxy flux .    considering the emission lines ,",
    "our results indicate negligible dust extinction and posible evidence of microlensing .",
    "the method we use in this paper allows us to separate microlensing from dust extinction without a theoretical model for the lens system .",
    "we have demonstrated the method for the most complicated cases : doubly - imaged quasars .",
    "we tested the hypothesis that the cores of the emission lines do not vary with time by comparing our own magnitude differences in the emission lines with values from the literature that were obtained at different epochs , including values corrected for measured time - delays , and we conclude that they are nearly constant in time .",
    "thus , except in cases where extinction is significant , the magnitude differences in the emission line cores are reliable estimators of the intrinsic magnitude differences unaffected by microlensing .",
    "following @xcite we have estimated the impact of time delays in our microlensing measurements for our objects . in the worst case scenario ( q0957 + 561 , sdss1004 + 4142 , and sdss1029 + 2623 )",
    "a time delay can introduce variabilities @xmath72 mag and chromaticities @xmath68 mag .",
    "the measurements we obtain for those objects are at least twice the estimated values .",
    "although more data are needed for confirmation , it appears that time - delay induced variability has a modest impact .",
    "differences in the wings of the civ and siiv broad emission line profiles are found in @xmath10 and @xmath11 images of sdss1004 + 4112 , as detected previously by @xcite , but the enhancement in the blue wing is smaller than observed in 2004 . in he1104 - 1805",
    "we also have detected a slight enhancement in the red wings of civ and siiv in image @xmath10 with respect to image @xmath11 .",
    "the average microlensing magnification free from extinction was obtained as the difference in magnitudes between the emission lines and the continuum .",
    "the latter was obtained directly from the spectra in those cases where there is no contamination by the lens galaxy ( all systems except hs0818 + 1227 and q0957 + 561 ) , otherwise we used hst continuum data free from lens galaxy contamination available in the literature .",

    "we detected a blue wing enhancement in the high ionization lines of sdss1004 + 4112 that are qualitatively similar to the effect described by previous authors but of smaller amplitude .",
    "we have also detected strong chromatic variability in the continuum .",
    "the presence of variability in both lines and continuum supports the hypothesis of microlensing to explain the blue wing enhancements in the lines .",
    "our data indicate negligible dust extinction .",

    "we find no extinction but we detected chromatic microlensing with large variations between two epochs that change the sign of the continuum slope .",
    "we estimate @xmath176 at @xmath175  and @xmath7 . this size is greater than those inferred from the thin disk theory and either the intrinsic flux or the central black hole mass by @xcite . however , our results agree with recent values presented in @xcite @xmath177 and @xmath178 the value of @xmath56 we obtain is significantly smaller than the 4/3 value predicted by the standard model .",
