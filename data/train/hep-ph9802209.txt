    "there are several neutrino oscillation experiments which have indicated the nonzero neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "the solar neutrino problem is the first to be noted .",
    "the deficit of the solar neutrinos predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite can be explained by neutrino oscillation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath6 can be @xmath7 , or a sterile neutrino . in the case of resonant msw transitions",
    "@xcite , it was found @xcite that the oscillation parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the mixing angle ) given by @xmath11 can explain the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the solar neutrino problem can also be solved by invoking vacuum neutrino oscillations @xcite , in which case the neutrino mass - squared difference is about @xmath12 .",
    "another hint of the neutrino masses and mixing comes from the experiments on the atmospheric neutrinos .",

    "the allowed ranges for the oscillation parameters were obtained @xcite , assuming @xmath15 , @xmath16 the recent results from the chooz reactor experiment appear to exclude the @xmath17 oscillation as a solution to the atmospheric neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "the neutrino oscillations @xmath18 and @xmath19 give rise to a similar result for the atmospheric neutrino anomaly since @xmath20 and @xmath21 are not distinguishable in the current experiments .",
    "new experiments with high statistics in super - kamiokande and icarus can provide the discrimination by measuring the neutral current events appearing , for instance , in neutral pion productions @xcite .",
    "finally , indications in favor of @xmath22 oscillations have been found recently in the lsnd experiment @xcite , in which antineutrinos originating from the decays of @xmath23 s at rest were detected .",
    "the karmen experiment @xcite will be able to crosscheck the positive result of lsnd in the near future . from the analysis of the data of the lsnd experiment and the negative results of other short - baseline experiments ( in particular , the bugey @xcite and bnl e776 @xcite experiments ) , one obtains the oscillation parameters : @xmath24    all the existing neutrino experiments which are in favor of neutrino oscillations can not be accommodated by a scheme with mixing of ordinary three neutrinos .",
    "that is , the allowed range of the mass - squared differences which explain the solar neutrino , atmospheric neutrino , and lsnd neutrino experiments do not overlap at all . in order to obtain three independent mass - squared differences which can explain the known three experiments , we need at least four massive neutrinos @xcite . furthermore",
    ", only two schemes of neutrino mass - squared differences are compatible with the results of all the experiments @xcite .",
    "four neutrino masses are divided into two pairs of almost degenerate masses separated by a gap of @xmath25 which is indicated by the result of the lsnd experiments : @xmath26 & & \\label{ab } \\\\[-2 mm ] & & \\mbox{(b ) } \\qquad \\underbrace { \\overbrace{m_1 < m_2}^{\\mathrm{solar } }                  \\quad \\ll",

    "if there exists a fourth neutrino , it has to be a sterile neutrino as indicated by the invisible decay width of @xmath29 .",
    "the mixing between a fourth neutrino and active neutrinos could be constrained by the big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the active  sterile neutrino mixings suggested by the known neutrino experiments may increase the effective number of neutrinos and deplete the electron neutrino and antineutrino populations in the nucleosynthesis era , and thus alter significantly the prediction for the primordial @xmath30he mass fraction .",
    "formerly , the effective number of neutrino species was considered to be less than four , and therefore the large mixings between a sterile neutrino and the active neutrinos solving the solar neutrino and the atmospheric neutrino problem were disfavored @xcite . however , due to the recent observational determinations of the primordial deuterium abundance@xcite , the big - bang nucleosynthesis constraints on the non - standard neutrinos have been revised .",
    "it has been argued that the effective number of neutrino species more than four ( but less than five ) can be acceptable @xcite , in which case there is room to bring one sterile neutrino species into equilibrium with the known neutrinos in the early universe and therefore no constraints on active  sterile neutrino oscillation parameters can be drawn .",
    "more interestingly , it is possible to reconcile sterile neutrinos with big - bang nucleosynthesis even if the effective number of neutrino species turns out to be less than three .",
    "it has been found that the active  sterile neutrino oscillation solving the solar or atmospheric neutrino problem does not increase the effective number of neutrinos if the relic neutrino asymmetry is large enough ( @xmath31 ) @xcite .    in the conventional seesaw mechanism ,",
    "right - handed neutrinos are heavy to make active neutrinos very light . in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility that a right - handed neutrino remain light , that is , the right handed - neutrino mass matrix is singular and has rank two in a three generation model .",
    "this is called the singular seesaw mechanism @xcite which will be analyzed in section ii .",
    "three mass - squared differences for the light four neutrinos will be parameterized in terms of two mass scales ; the dirac mass and majorana mass of heavy right - handed neutrinos . by construction ,",
    "the sterile neutrino ( a light right - handed neutrino ) and an active neutrino are maximally mixed , which is desirable for the solution of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly . in section iii , we will find the region of the two mass parameters by which all the neutrino data mentioned above can be accommodated .",
    "it is then required that the dirac mass scale is @xmath32 ev and the heavy majorana mass scale is @xmath32 kev .",
    "such low mass scales are shown to imply the presence of an intermediate scale @xmath4 gev and the grand unification scale @xmath33 gev in the double seesaw mechanism introduced in section iv .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v.",
    "in the singular seesaw mechanism @xcite , the neutrino mass matrix is written by @xmath34\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the usual dirac neutrino mass matrix and @xmath36 is the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix taken to be a singular ( rank - two ) @xmath37 matrix . here",
    ", we assume that there is no hierarchical structure in the mass matrices @xmath35 and @xmath36 whose elements are of the same order of magnitude , denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "the small number @xmath39 encodes the hierarchical structure of the dirac and sterile ( right - handed ) neutrino masses .",
    "the value @xmath38 is related to physics of lepton number violation and new physics .",
    "two parameters @xmath39 and @xmath38 are to be determined later .",
    "we write the neutrino states in the interaction basis as @xmath40\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent , respectively , the three standard active and sterile neutrinos . in the context of the singular seesaw mechanism ,",
    "a combination of @xmath42 becomes light . in order to obtain physical neutrino states and mass eigenvalues ,",
    "we perform diagonalization by several steps .",
    "first step is to diagonalize the majorana part by a rotation matrix @xmath43 such as @xmath44 % \\left [          \\matrix {                    0 & \\epsilon m_d r^{t } \\cr           \\epsilon rm_d^{\\dag } & \\tilde{m}_m          }    \\right ] % \\left [          \\matrix { 1 & 0 \\cr 0 & r } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath45 since @xmath36 is a rank - two singular matrix , we can take zero for the @xmath46-element of the diagonal matrix @xmath47 . then",

    "in particular , the matrix elements @xmath55 for @xmath56 are zero .",
    "the values of the other matrix elements can be taken to be arbitrary .",

    "the mass matrix relevant for heavy neutrinos is @xmath64 .",
    "the nonzero values of the matrix elements are of order @xmath38 . and",
    "the physical neutrino fields are given by @xmath65 the masses of the light neutrinos come from diagonalizing mass matrix @xmath60 given by @xmath66 neglecting @xmath67 term , the most general matrix is @xmath68 \\,.\\ ] ] the eigenvalues of @xmath60 are two zeros and @xmath69 .",
    "these two - fold degeneracies are lifted by the @xmath67 term @xmath70",
    ". therefore , the light neutrinos are , in general , two with mass @xmath71 and two with mass @xmath72 , their mass difference being of order @xmath71 .",
    "when we neglect the @xmath67 term in the mass matrix , the neutrino mass eigenstates are @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the massless component of the sterile neutrino mass matrix . other two neutrino states ( whose masses are of order @xmath71 ) are orthogonal combinations of @xmath75 . including the @xmath67 term in the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath60 , it will give an order of @xmath39 to the neutrino mixing .",
    "therefore , we know that the lightest pair of the neutrinos with mass @xmath71 are most likely active neutrinos",
    ". however , the compositions of the @xmath76 and @xmath77 are dependent on the form of the mass matrix .",
    "for example , let @xmath78 , then the electron , muon and tau neutrino component in @xmath75 is @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "the other half of these neutrinos is the sterile neutrino . as another example , consider @xmath80 and @xmath81 , then the electron and muon neutrino component in @xmath75 is @xmath82 , respectively , and the other half of @xmath75 is sterile .",
    "we summarize the neutrino mass eigenvalues and their mass - squared differences which are relevant to the known neutrino experiments for our discussions .",
    "the neutrino masses are determined as follows : @xmath83 two lightest neutrinos , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , are mostly active neutrinos .",
    "two medium - weighted neutrinos , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , are almost equal combinations of active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "two heaviest , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , are almost sterile neutrinos .",
    "therefore , the mass - squared differences are given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "as shown above , the singular seesaw mechanism has three @xmath90 scales which provide a possibility of explaining the three known experiments .",
    "it is , however , a priori uncertain whether three experimental data ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) can be accommodated simultaneously since the three @xmath90 are parametrized by only two numbers @xmath39 and @xmath38 .",
    "we wish to see if the scheme ( b ) in eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) can indeed be realized .",
    "note first that the large mixing required for the atmospheric neutrino oscillation is built in the singular seesaw mechanism .",
    "that is , a combination of active neutrinos and a sterile neutrino have the maximal mixing to yield degenerate neutrinos @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the atmospheric neutrino problem can be explained by the large mixing @xmath92 oscillation with the mass - squared difference @xmath93 .",
    "the solar neutrino problem is then to be solved by the @xmath94 oscillation with the smallest mass - squared difference @xmath95 . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath17 oscillation occurs automatically with the largest mass - squared difference @xmath96 , which may yield observable signals in the @xmath17 oscillation experiments .",
    "let us now look for the parameter region of ( @xmath39 , @xmath38 ) determined by the neutrino experiments , that is , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and/or @xmath99 .",
    "from the first two identities based on the msw solution to the solar neutrino problem and the atmospheric neutrino oscillation , one finds the region of a crescent shape inside @xmath100 and @xmath101 kev .",
    "remarkably , this region give rise to @xmath102 in the sensitivity range of the lsnd and karmen experiments . imposing the lsnd positive result ,",
    "the allowed region of ( @xmath39 , @xmath38 ) is further reduced , and in fact determined solely by the solar neutrino and lsnd data .",
    "the common region of ( @xmath39 , @xmath38 ) which can explain all three known experiments lies inside @xmath103 which is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "from eqs .",
    "( [ mns ] ) and ( [ it ] ) , we find the following typical values for the neutrino masses ; @xmath104    if the solar neutrino deficit is due to the vacuum oscillation , the solar neutrino data and the atmospheric neutrino data yields @xmath105",
    ". then the heavy right - handed neutrinos ( @xmath106 ) get mass @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "the right - handed neutrinos with such masses may overclose the universe as they can not decay into the standard model particles .",
    "the muon and light sterile neutrinos can be candidates for hot dark matter satisfying the overclosure bound @xmath109 .",
    "but they are too heavy to provide a good fit for the structure formation as @xmath110 is required in mixed dark matter models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one finds no region of ( @xmath39,@xmath38 ) which accommodates all the three neutrino experiments .",
    "therefore , our model disfavors the possibility of solving the solar neutrino problem in terms of the vacuum oscillation .",
    "it follows from the result ( [ masses ] ) that almost degenerate muon and sterile neutrinos can be good candidates for hot dark matter @xcite , and the heavy sterile neutrino can be a candidate for the warm dark matter .",
    "thus , the existence of hot dark matter desirable for structure formation in the mixed dark matter scenario is a natural consequence of the singular seesaw mechanism under consideration .",
    "it seems unnatural to have sterile ( right - handed ) neutrinos with mass scale @xmath111 . in the usual seesaw mechanism",
    "its scale is about @xmath112 or gut scale .",
    "such a low mass scale of lepton number violation is not acceptable . in order to raise the lepton number violation scale ,",
    "we introduce the `` double seesaw mechanism '' in which extra sterile neutrinos are needed in addition to the ordinary right - handed neutrinos .",
    "a simple realization of the double seesaw mechanism can be found in grand unified theory ( gut ) with intermediate step breakings .",
    "the minimal ( non - supersymmetric ) grand unification model is ruled out from the study of the gauge coupling evolution@xcite , but non - minimal gut models and supersymmeric gut models can successfully accommodate the gauge coupling unification and the absence of proton decay . as an example",
    ", let us consider a gut model with @xmath113 unification group .",
    "it has five neutral particles in each generations of the fermion * 27 * representation : two ( * 16 * under so(10 ) ) of them are the neutrinos in the discussion , other three neutrinos ( * 1 * + * 10 * under so(10 ) ) are heavy neutrinos with gut scale masses .",
    "suppose that the mass matrix of the active neutrinos , the right - handed neutrinos and the extra sterile neutrinos takes the form ; @xmath114 \\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath115 is the dirac mass matrix originating from the electroweak symmetry breaking , and @xmath116 are generated from a higher symmetry breaking .",
    "note that @xmath117 are @xmath118 matrices , and @xmath119 is @xmath120 matrix in the three generation model .",
    "it should be mentioned that the mass matrix ( [ basicm ] ) requires fine - tunings which may not be a serious problem in supersymmetric theories .",
    "given the hierarchy @xmath121 , the seesaw mechanism with the ultra heavy neutrino masses @xmath119 gives rise to the @xmath122 matrix , @xmath123 \\cdot m_s^{-1 } \\cdot \\left [ \\matrix {   m_l^t & m_r^t   } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\[2 mm ] & = & - % = - \\left [ \\matrix { m_l m_s^{-1 } m_l^t    &   m_l m_s^{-1 } m_r^t     \\cr \\cr m_r m_s^{-1 } m_l^t &   m_r m_s^{-1 }   m_r^t } \\right ] \\label{matrixlrs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be identified with the matrix ( [ firstm ] ) apart from the upper - left corner .",
    "note that the singular seesaw mechanism requires the lower - right submatrix of eq .",
    "( [ msub ] ) to be singular .",
    "the nonzero contribution in the upper - left part of the matrix ( [ msub ] ) is order of the solar neutrino mass scale @xmath124 ev which does not alter our conclusion .    following the discussion in the previous section",
    ", we can find the typical scales of @xmath125 and @xmath119 .",
    "namely , requiring @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 gev , one obtains @xmath129 it is worth emphasizing that the heaviest mass scale @xmath119 coincides with the conventional gut scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the intermediate scale @xmath125 turns out to be considerably lower than the conventional scale @xmath130 gev desirable for the usual seesaw mechanism . in gut models , various intermediate scales of gauge symmetry breaking",
    "can be made consistent with the unification of gauge coupling constants .",
    "in particular , such a low scale @xmath125 may be obtained by introducing certain exotic particles to the gut model @xcite .",
    "the scale @xmath125 may be related to physics of supersymmetry breaking . in the supersymmetric standard model , supersymmetry breaking",
    "can be mediated either by gravitation or by gauge interactions @xcite .",
    "the latter scheme provides a natural suppression of flavor violation in the supersymmetric sector and yields distinctive phenomenological and cosmological consequences @xcite .",
    "the minimal type of such theories requires the existence of vector - like quarks and leptons ( messengers ) at the mass scale @xmath131 gev .",
    "this is a just right scale for @xmath125 under discussion .",
    "therefore , in the supersymmetric standard model with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking , it is conceivable that some messengers are vector - like sterile neutrinos with the mass matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ basicm ] ) .",
    "motivated by recent experimental evidences for nonzero neutrino masses and mixing , we have examined the consequences of the singular seesaw mechanism .",
    "the three mass - squared scales required for simultaneously explaining the solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies , and the lsnd data can be realized if the majorana mass matrix of right - handed neutrinos is rank - two . without assuming any hierarchies in the dirac and majorana mass matrices , three mass - squared values are found to be determined by two mass parameters : the dirac mass for the active neutrinos and the majorana mass for heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the singular seesaw mechanism can not accommodate simultaneously the vacuum oscillation explanation of the solar neutrino deficit , and the atmospheric neutrino oscillation .",
    "however , the msw solution to the solar neutrino problem is consistent with the model and the existence of the lsnd mass scale is also explained .",
    "the almost maximal mixing of a sterile neutrino with the muon neutrino ( having the dirac mass @xmath132 ev ) explains the atmospheric neutrino anomaly , and the mixing of the electron and tau neutrino explains the solar neutrino anomaly ( having the lightest mass @xmath133 ev ) .",
    "two massive right - handed neutrinos turn out to be rather light ( having the majorana mass @xmath134 kev ) .",
    "we stress that the existence of hot dark matter ( consists of @xmath135 ) desirable for the structure formation of the universe is a natural consequence of our scheme .",
    "in addition , warm dark matter can be provided by the heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we have introduced the double seesaw mechanism in which the two low mass scales , @xmath136 and @xmath137 are generated by the weak scale @xmath138 gev and an intermediate scale @xmath139 gev together with the usual grand unification scale @xmath140 gev . a candidate for the intermediate scale @xmath125 can be found in the gut models with an intermediate step breaking , or in gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking models .",
