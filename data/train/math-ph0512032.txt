    "the dynamics of a particle which is allowed to move freely , i.e. without the action of external forces , on a smooth surface is the classical problem in analytical dynamics , @xcite .",
    "it is generally hard to solve .",
    "in fact , the four hamiltonian equations for orbits on a surface can be reduced to a system of two hamiltonian equations by use of the integral of energy and elimination of time , @xcite .",
    "but the system obtained in this way may have no further integrals and admit of no exact solutions .",
    "thus , the usual reduction method , @xcite , or the momentum map according to the current terminology , does not work .",
    "the problem looks even more pessimistic if one aims at drawing a picture of the ensemble of orbits on a surface , for it requires the study of the general form and disposition of orbits on a surface of general shape .    in this paper",
    "the surface is supposed to be a perturbed standard sphere . using the perturbation theory",
    "we construct a hamiltonian system , which enables us to give a fairly detailed picture of the ensemble of orbits by means of graphs on the standard sphere ; the vertices of the graphs corresponding to orbits which are asymptotically closed and the edges of the graphs to orbits joining the almost closed ones .",
    "to be specific , the central idea relies on the circumstance that if the surface does not differ substantially from a sphere , great circles of the latter may serve a good approximation to orbits of the particle .",
    "if segments of an orbit are short enough , one can visualize it as winding up in coils ; loops or rings of the coil corresponding to great circles of the sphere , see fig.[fig1 ] . hence approximating the successive rings by great circles",
    ", we may describe the change in the position of the rings by the precession of a great circle , which in its turn is determined by the normal vector @xmath0 of the plane cutting the sphere by the great circle . to cast this picture in a more quantitative form",
    "we may use the fact that the normal vector @xmath0 is the angular momentum of the particle moving on the great circle .",
    "thus , we may use perturbation theory , i.e. averaging method , for determining the motion of the angular momentum .",
    "the equations of motion of a particle on a surface given by the equation @xmath1 can be cast in the form of the equation , @xcite , @xcite ,    @xmath2    the lagrangian multiplier can be found explicitly , so that the equation of motion , in the form that does not involve @xmath3 , reads    @xmath4    in this paper we assume that the equations of the surface be of the form    @xmath5    where @xmath6 are small . then equations ( [ 2newt_last ] ) read    @xmath7    the angular momentum @xmath8 verifies the equations , which follow from ( [ concrnewt ] )    @xmath9    the equations given above are exact , in the sense that they do not involve any approximation and do not use the @xmath6 being small . their treatment still needs further refining , and this will be done with the help of the method of averaging .",
    "generally , the approach relies on studying the evolution equations for integrals of motion of the unperturbed system , i.e. in our case the normals to the planes of the large circles , with respect to the basic periodic solution of the latter .",
    "the averaging serves as a filter separating the main regular part of the solution from the oscillating one caused by small terms considered as perturbation , see @xcite .",
    "we may write the basic equation for the particle s motion on the sphere of unit radius in the form    @xmath10    where vectors @xmath11 can be conveniently taken in the form    @xmath12    the angular velocity @xmath13 is given by the equation @xmath14 , valid to within the first order of perturbation . here",
