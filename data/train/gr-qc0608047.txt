    "the accelerated mode of expansion of the present day universe encourages many researchers to introduce different kind of sources that is able to explain this . among them",

    "recently cosmological models with spinor field have been extensively studied by a number of authors in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the principal motive of the papers @xcite was to find out the regular solutions of the corresponding field equations . in some special cases ,",
    "namely with a cosmological constant ( @xmath0 term ) that plays the role of an additional gravitation field , we indeed find singularity - free solutions .",
    "it was also found that the introduction of nonlinear spinor field results in a rapid growth of the universe .",
    "this allows us to consider the spinor field as a possible candidate to explain the accelerated mode of expansion .",
    "note that similar attempt is made in a recent paper by kremer _ et .",
    "_ @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the role of a spinor field in generating an accelerated mode of expansion of the universe .",
    "since similar systems , though from different aspects were thoroughly studied in @xcite , to avoid lengthy calculations regarding spinor and scalar fields , we mainly confine ourselves to the study of master equation describing the evolution of bi universe .",
    "we here give the solutions to the spinor and scalar field equations , details of these solutions can be found in @xcite .",
    "we consider a self consistent system of nonlinear spinor and scalar fields within the scope of a bianchi type - i gravitational field filled with a perfect fluid .",
    "the spinor and the scalar field is given by the lagrangian @xmath1 - m{\\bar \\psi}\\psi + f + \\frac{1}{2 } ( 1 + \\lambda_1 f_1)\\,{\\varphi}_{,\\alpha}{\\varphi}^{,\\alpha } , \\label{lag}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the coupling constant and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are some arbitrary functions of invariants generated from the real bilinear forms of a spinor field .",
    "here we assume @xmath5 and @xmath6 with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the gravitational field is chosen in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the functions of @xmath13 only and the speed of light is taken to be unity .",
    "we also define @xmath14    we consider the spinor and scalar field to be space independent . in that case for the spinor and the scalar fields and metric functions we find the following expressions @xcite .    for @xmath15",

    "for the scalar field we find @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the integration constants .    solving the einstein equation for the metric functions we find @xmath31^{1/3 } \\exp \\bigl[x_i \\int [ \\tau ( t')]^{-1}dt ' \\bigr ] , \\label{a_i}\\ ] ] with the integration constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 obeying @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "note that to evaluate the metric functions at any given time @xmath36 we should first integrate @xmath37 , and only then substitute @xmath13 by @xmath36 .",
    "the theoretical arguments  @xcite and recent experimental data which support the existence of an anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one , led us to consider the models of universe with anisotropic background .",
    "on the other hand the isotropy of the present - day universe lead us to study how the initially anisotropic bi space - time can evolve into an isotropic friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) one . since for the frw universe @xmath38 , for the bi universe to evolve into a frw one we should set @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the isotropic nature of the present universe leads to the fact that the three other constants @xmath33 should be close to zero as well , i.e. , @xmath40 , ( @xmath41 ) , so that @xmath42^{-1}dt \\to 0 $ ] for @xmath43 ( for @xmath44 with @xmath45 the integral tends to zero as @xmath46 for any @xmath33 ) .",
    "the rapid growth of the universe due to the introduction of the nonlinear spinor field to the system results in the earlier isotropization .    as is seen from , , and , the spinor , scalar and metric functions are in some functional dependence of @xmath47 .",
    "it should be noted that besides these , other physical quantities such as spin - current , charge etc . and invariant of space - time",
    "are too expressed via @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that at any space - time points where @xmath48 the spinor , scalar and gravitational fields become infinity , hence the space - time becomes singular at this point @xcite .",
    "so it is very important to study the equation for @xmath47 ( which can be viewed as master equation ) in details , exactly what we shall do in the section to follow . in doing",
    "so we analyze the role of spinor field in the character of evolution .",
    "in this section we study the role of spinor field in the evolution of the universe . but first of all let me qualitatively show the differences that occur at the later stage of expansion depending on how the sources of the gravitational field were introduced in the system . in doing",
    "so we write the einstein equation in the following form :    [ ee ] @xmath49    here @xmath0 is the cosmological constant , @xmath50 is the energy - momentum tensor of the source field .",
    "is thoroughly studied in @xcite .",
    "after a little manipulation from one finds the equation for @xmath47 which is indeed the acceleration equation and has the following general form : @xmath51 note also that here a positive @xmath0 corresponds to the universal repulsive force which is often considered as a form of dark energy , while a negative one gives an additional gravitational force .",
    "the bianchi identity @xmath52 in our case gives @xmath53 after a little manipulation from and one finds the following expression for @xmath54 :    @xmath55    where the definition of the generalized hubble constant @xmath56 as @xmath57 let us analyze the relation in details .",
    "consider the case when @xmath58 . at the moment when the expansion rate is zero ( it might be at a time prior to the `` big bang '' , or sometimes in the far future when the universe cease to expand we have @xmath59 . )",
    "the nonnegativity of @xmath54 suggests that @xmath60 . before considering the case for large @xmath47",
    "we should like to study the eq . in detail .",
    "for the spinor and scalar fields chosen in this paper they are identically fulfilled .",

    "finds something like @xmath62 const . , where @xmath63 is some constant ( in case of perfect fluid @xmath64 ) .",
    "thus we see that the energy density of the source field introduced into the system as above decreases with the growth of @xmath47 . now",

    "as far as negative @xmath0 is concerned , its presence imposes some restriction on @xmath47 , namely , there exists some upper limit for @xmath47 ( note that @xmath47 is essentially nonnegative , i.e. bound from below ) .",
    "thus we see that a negative @xmath0 , depending on the choice of parameters can give rise to an oscillatory mode of expansion @xcite .",
    "thus we can conclude the following :    _ let @xmath50 be the source of the einstein field equation ; @xmath54 is the energy density and @xmath69 are the principal pressure and @xmath70",
    ". an ever - expanding bi universe may be obtained if and only if the @xmath0 term is positive ( describes a repulsive force and can be viewed as a form of dark energy ) and is introduced into the system as in or if the source field introduced as a part of energy - momentum tensor behaves like a @xmath0 term as @xmath71 .",

    "\\label{poten}\\ ] ] from a mechanical point of view eq . can be interpreted as an equation of motion of a single particle with unit mass under the force @xmath102 . in @xmath103",
    "is the integration constant which can be treated as energy level , and @xmath104 is the potential of the force @xmath105 .",
    "we solve the eq . numerically using runge - kutta method .",
    "the initial value of @xmath47 is taken to be a reasonably small one , while the corresponding first derivative @xmath106 is evaluated from for a given @xmath103 .",
    "let us go back to the eq . .",
    "in view of one sees , @xmath107 as @xmath71 , i.e. , if @xmath108 is considered to be the acceleration of the bi universe , then the massive spinor field essentially can be viewed as a source for ever lasting acceleration .",
    "note that it does not contradicts our previous statement about the role of energy - momentum tensor on ever expanding universe , since the spinor field satisfies the bianchi identity identically .",
    "now a few words about considering @xmath108 as acceleration .",
    "the einstein equations for the frw model read    [ frw ] @xmath109    from one finds @xmath110 the equation is known as the acceleration equation . in analogy for the bi universe from we can write @xmath111 and declare it as acceleration equation . though setting @xmath112 we recover the original definition , hardly it will be helpful in our case .",
    "so in bi universe we assume @xmath108 be the acceleration and eq .",
    "be the acceleration equation .",
    "let us now define the deceleration parameter .",
    "in frw cosmology the deceleration parameter has the form @xmath113 = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigl(\\frac{1}{h_{\\rm frw}}\\bigr ) -1 , \\label{decprfrw}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is the hubble parameter for frw model .",
    "in analogy we can define a deceleration parameter as well .",
    "if we define the generalized deceleration parameter in the following way : @xmath115 , \\label{decpo}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 , then the standard deceleration parameter is recovered at @xmath112 .",
    "but is this case the definition for acceleration adopted here is no longer valid .",
    "so we switch to the second choice and following belinchon and harko _ et .",
    "@xcite define the generalized deceleration parameter as @xmath117 after a little manipulation in view of and the deceleration parameter can be presented as @xmath118    let us now go back to the equations , , and . as one sees , the positivity of the radical imposes some restriction on the value of @xmath47 , namely in case of @xmath119 and @xmath120 the value of @xmath47 can not be too close to zero at any space - time point .",
    "it is clearly seen from the graphical view of the potential [ cf .",
    "[ potp ] ] .",
    "thus we can conclude that for some special choice of problem parameters the introduction of nonlinear spinor field given by a self - action provides singularity - free solutions . as it was shown in @xcite the regular solution",
    "is obtained only at the expense of broken dominant - energy condition in the hawking - penrose theorem .",
    "_ if , in an eigentetrad of @xmath121 , @xmath122 denotes the energy density and @xmath123 denote the three principal pressure , then the dominant energy condition can be written as _",
    "@xcite :    @xmath124    the dominant energy condition for the bi metric can be written in the form :    @xmath125    in fig .",
    "[ potm ] we plot the potential for a negative @xmath80 .",
    "as one sees , in the vicinity of @xmath48 there exists a bottomless potential hole . as one sees ,",
    "if in case of a self - action the initial value of @xmath47 is too close to zero and the constant @xmath103 is less than @xmath126 ( the maximum value of the potential in presence of a self - action ) , the universe will never come out of the hole .    for numerical solutions we set @xmath127 , spinor mass @xmath128 , the power of nonlinearity we choose as @xmath129 , @xmath130 and for perfect fluid we set @xmath131 that corresponds to a radiation",
    ". we also set @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the initial value of @xmath47 is taken to be @xmath134 .",
    "the coupling constant is chosen to be @xmath135 , while the self coupling constant is taken to be either @xmath136 or @xmath137 . here , in the figures we use the following notations",
    ": + 1 corresponds to the case with self - action and interaction ; + 2 corresponds to the case with self - action only ; + 3 corresponds to the case with interaction only .    1 cm    as one sees from fig .",
    "[ potp ] , in presence of a self - action of the spinor field with a positive @xmath80 , there occurs an infinitely high barrier as @xmath138 , it means that in the case considered here @xmath47 can not be trivial [ if treated classically , the universe can not approach to a point unless it stays at an infinitely high energy level ] .",
    "thus , the nonlinearity of the spinor field provided by the self - action generates singularity - free evolution of the universe .",
    "but , as was already mentioned , this regularity can be achieved only at the expense of dominant energy condition in hawking - penrose theorem .",
    "it is also clear that if the nonlinearity is induced by a scalar field , @xmath47 may be trivial as well , thus giving rise to space - time singularity .",
    "note that cases in presence of a @xmath0 term are thoroughly studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that introduction of a positive @xmath0 just accelerates the speed of expansion , whereas , a negative @xmath0 depending of the choice of @xmath103 generates oscillatory or non - periodic mode of evolution .",
    "note also that the regular solution obtained my means of a negative @xmath0 in case of interaction does not result in broken dominant energy condition @xcite .    in figs .",
    "[ epp ] and [ epm ] we plot the corresponding energy density and pressure .",
    "as one sees , in case of a positive @xmath80 the energy density is initially negative while the pressure is positive . in this case",
    "though the solution is singularity - free , the violation of dominant energy takes place . in case of a negative @xmath80",
    "the pressure is always negative .",
    "the purpose of plotting the energy density and pressure is to show that the energy density of the source field indeed decreases with the increase of the universe .",
    "this also shows that there exists an interval where the energy density of the system with spinor field nonlinearity generated by the self - action is negative .",
    "this is in line with our earlier assumption .",
    "moreover , we see the pressure of the source field becomes negative in course of evolution ( in case of self - action with a positive @xmath80 pressure is initially positive , but with the expansion of the universe it becomes negative , whereas , in case of of a negative @xmath80 as well as in case of interacting fields the pressure is always negative ) . recall that the dark energy ( e.g. quintessence , chaplygin gas ) , modelled to explain the late time acceleration of the universe , has the negative pressure .",
    "so we argue that the models with nonlinear spinor field and interacting spinor and scalar fields to some extent can be considered as an alternative to dark energy which is able to explain the late time acceleration of the universe .    in the figs .",
    "[ acp ] and [ acm ] we illustrate the acceleration of the universe for positive and negative @xmath80 , respectively",
    ". as one sees , in both cases we have decreasing acceleration that tends to @xmath139 as @xmath71 .    in figs .",
    "[ dpp ] and [ dpm ] we plot the deceleration parameter .    the figs .",
    "[ acp ] , [ acm ] , [ dpp ] and [ dpm ] show the accelerated mode of expansion of the universe .",
    "as one sees , the acceleration is decreasing with time .",
    "depending of the choice of nonlinearity it undergoes an initial deceleration phase .",
    "it is also seen that the nonlinear term plays proactive role at the initial stage while at the later stage spinor mass is crucial for the accelerated mode of expansion .",
    "we considered a system of interaction nonlinear spinor and scalar fields within the scope of a bi cosmological model filled with perfect fluid .",
    "the spinor field nonlinearity gives rise to an effective negative pressure in the course of evolution .",
    "comparison of the effective pressure of the nonlinear spinor field with that of a dark energy given by a quintessence or chaplygin gas leads us to conclude that the spinor field can be seen as an alternative to the dark energy able to explain the acceleration of the universe .",
    "it was shown that the nonlinear spinor term is proactive at the early stage of the evolution and essentially accelerates the process of evolution , while at the later stage of evolution the spinor mass holds the key .",
    "given the fact that _ neutrino _ is described by the spinor field equation and it too possesses mass ( though too small but nonzero ) , the presence of huge number of neutrino in the universe can be seen as one of the possible factor of the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "it was also shown that for some specific choice of parameters it is possible to construct singularity - free model of the universe , but this regularity results in the broken dominant energy condition of the hawking - penrose theorem ."
