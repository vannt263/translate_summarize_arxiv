    "investigations of the feas based compounds are presently on the rise within the condensed matter community due to relatively high superconducting transition temperatures of electron or hole doped rfeaso ( r = la , sm ) and hole doped afe@xmath0as@xmath0 compounds ( a = sr , ba ) @xcite .",
    "the feas layers common to both series of compounds seem to be responsible for superconductivity .",
    "since superconductivity in this new class of compounds coincides with the disappearance of a spin density wave ( sdw ) type magnetic transition , spin fluctuations of fe moments are suggested to play a crucial role in establishing the superconducting ground state in these novel superconductors @xcite .",
    "the importance of spin fluctuations for unconventional superconductivity has already been realized while discussing the properties of heavy fermion superconductors like cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 , cemin@xmath1 ( m = co , rh , ir ) as well as high t@xmath2 cuprates @xcite .",
    "even though we already have numerous superconductors encompassing the whole range of temperature up to 160  k , the discovery of feas based superconductors was greeted with great attention primarily due to its apparent non - phononic origin and non - copper based origin .",
    "this is the first time that magnetic fluctuations of the `` truly magnetic '' element iron may produce superconductivity at such a high temperatures .    in rfeaso compounds ,",
    "the superconducting transition temperature increases as one substitutes la by smaller rare - earth atoms : @xmath3 rises from 28  k in lafeas(o , f ) to 52  k in smfeas(o , f ) @xcite .",
    "very recently , superconductivity has also been reported in rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 compounds for ( k , ba)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 and ( k , sr)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 with superconducting transition temperatures as high as 38 k. as in the case of rfeaso , the parent compound rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 also exhibits a spin - density - type phase transition in the temperature range between 160 and 200  k for ba and sr compounds which is suppressed by substituting k for the cationic site .",
    "the suppression of the sdw transition is accompanied by the appearance of superconductivity @xcite . just like in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and",
    "srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 the presence of a magnetic transition at 190  k in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 [ 9 ] was reported more than a decade ago using mbauer spectroscopy . from the small value of the hyperfine field",
    "the fe magnetism was suggested to be of itinerant character .",
    "magnetic susceptibility as well as mbauer spectroscopy further revealed the magnetic order of localized eu - moments at 20 k. however , there are no reports of electrical transport or thermodynamic properties on this system yet . because of the topical interest we have therefore decided to prepare high - quality single crystalline samples and to investigate the phase transitions in this compound using electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements .",
    "single crystals were obtained using a bridgman method . staring elements ( eu 99.99@xmath4 , fe 99.99 @xmath4 , as 99.99999@xmath4 )",
    "were taken in an al@xmath0o@xmath5 crucible which was then sealed in a ta - crucible under argon atmosphere .",
    "the sample handling was done in a glove box under very pure environment ( oxygen @xmath6 1 ppm , h@xmath0o @xmath6 1 ppm ) .",
    "the sealed crucible was heated under argon atmosphere at a rate of 30@xmath7c / hour to 600@xmath7c .",
    "the sample was kept at 600@xmath7c for 12 hours and then heated to 900@xmath7c where again the sample was kept for 1 hour .",
    "after this the sample was taken to 1300@xmath7c , kept there for 3 hours and then slowly cooled .",
    "we obtained several plate - like single crystals using this process .",
    "the quality of the single crystals was checked using the laue method and powder x - ray diffraction as well as scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive x - ray analysis . electrical resistivity and specific heat",
    "were measured using physical properties measurement system ( ppms , quantum design , usa ) .",
    "magnetic properties were measured using superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer procured from quantum design , usa .      we have performed density functional band structure calculations using two full potential codes : wien2k@xcite and fplo@xcite using the local ( spin ) density approximation ( l(s)da ) including spin - orbit coupling .",
    "additionally , we have included the strong coulomb repulsion in the eu 4@xmath8 orbitals on a mean field level using the lsda+@xmath9 approximation applying the atomic - limit double counting scheme .",
    "we used the perdew - wang@xcite flavor of the exchange correlation potential and the energies were converged on a dense @xmath10- mesh with 24@xmath11 points .",
    "we used the current experimental lattice parameters . the as position ( @xmath12=0.362 )",
    "was taken according to ref . .",
    "there exists no spectroscopy data for eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , therefore we have used a @xmath9 of 8 ev , standard value for a eu@xmath13 ion .",
    "the results were checked for consistency with varying @xmath9 values .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction of the crushed single crystals confirms the single - phase nature of the single crystals which form in the thcr@xmath14si@xmath14 type tetragonal structure with lattice parameters @xmath15 = 3.907(4)  and @xmath16 = 12.114(3) in good agreement with the values reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "laue patterns reveal that plate - like single crystals are oriented with their @xmath16-axis perpendicular to the plates .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the specific heat data taken in the temperature range between 2 and 210  k. the low - temperature part of the specific heat shows a lambda - type anomaly with a peak at @xmath17  k associated with the magnetic transition of eu - moments .",

    "is observed in the form of a very pronounced jump of the specific heat at @xmath20  k. this peak reaches a maximum value of more than 50  j / mol k ( on top of the phonon contribution ) in spite of the small value of the magnetic moment evidenced by the weak hyperfine field @xcite .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the electrical resistivity decreases marginally with decreasing temperature down to 200  k. at @xmath22 190  k , @xmath23 shows a slight upturn leading to a peak before decreasing rapidly with further reduction of temperature .",
    "we attribute this increase of the resistivity to the opening of a gap at the fermi surface due to the formation of the sdw .",
    "similar resistivity signatures have previously been observed at the sdw transitions in e.g. cr metal @xcite , urh@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite and cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the resistivity upturn has not been observed in polycrystalline samples implies an anisotropic temperature dependence of the resistivity at @xmath24 . upon lowering the temperature from @xmath25  k to 20 k",
    "the resistivity continues to decrease . at 20",
    "k a further kink is found which results from the ordering of localized eu - moments .",
    "the resistivity ratio @xmath26(2k)/@xmath26(300k)@xmath27 is fairly small but of similar magnitude as found for many 122 compounds crystalizing in the thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 type tetragonal structure .",
    "since eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 has similar properties compared to bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , one would like to suppress the fe magnetism of this compound in order to induce superconductivity . as a first approach we have tried to dope divalent eu with monovalent k similar to ( k , m)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( m = ba , sr ) .",
    "our starting composition was k@xmath28eu@xmath29fe@xmath0as@xmath0 . however , our results suggest that a significant part of k evaporated out of the sample due to its high vapor pressure and due to our high - temperature crystal growth method , resulting is a much lower k - content in the sample .",
    "we found clear signatures of both magnetic phase transitions in the k - doped sample although the transition temperatures are reduced by a few degrees and the transitions are slightly broadened ( not shown ) compared to the parent compound .",
    "obviously , we need to improve the doping process in order to suppress the sdw and induce superconductivity .",
    "it is well known that the application of pressure is a suitable tool to change the valence state of eu from a @xmath30 configuration to a @xmath31 state .",
    "this transition from eu@xmath13 to eu@xmath32 would provide an additional charge to the feas layer as an alternative way to chemical doping .",
    "therefore , a study of the pressure dependence of the eu valence is very promising .      to gain deeper insight into the electronic structure of eufe@xmath14as@xmath14 and to locate the system within the afe@xmath14as@xmath14 family we carried out full potential electronic structure calculations within the l(s)da and lsda+@xmath9 .",
    "usually , for intermetallic eu compounds , lsda calculations result in a eu@xmath32 state with the eu 4@xmath8 electrons at the fermi level @xmath33 .",
    "this well known flaw is in contrast to experimental observations , caused by the underestimation of the strong couloumb repulsion @xmath9 for the localized eu 4@xmath8 electrons within the l(s)da .",
    "adding the couloumb correlation @xmath9 on a mean field level using lsda+@xmath9 , the 4@xmath8 states split by about @xmath9 into an occupied an an unoccupied complex .",
    "surprisingly , already the lsda for eufe@xmath14as@xmath14 yields a eu@xmath13 state with the occupied eu 4@xmath8 complex at about -0.5 ev and the unoccupied about 4 ev above @xmath33 .",
    "this result suggests a rather stable divalent eu state and is confirmed by our lsda+@xmath9 where the seven occupied eu 4@xmath8 bands are shifted further down in energy ( see fig .  [ dos ] ) .",
    "apart from the localized eu 4@xmath8 , the resulting electronic density of states ( dos ) is almost identical with the dos of the isovalent srfe@xmath14as@xmath14 ( see fig .  [ dos ] ) , especially for the fe 3@xmath34 states close to @xmath33 . within the physically realistic range ,",
    "this result is independent of the choice of @xmath9 .",
    "the strong similarity between both systems holds even for details of the band structure and the related fermi surfaces ( not shown ) . to study whether the small differences in the electronic structure arise from the change of structural parameters or from the change of the cation",
    ", we calculated the dos for the crystallographic data of the eu compound where eu was replaced by sr . comparing the resulting dos with that of srfe@xmath14as@xmath14 , we can assign these differences almost exclusively to the change in crystal geometry rather than to the substitution of the magnetic eu@xmath13 ion by sr .    in srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 ,",
    "only the fe atoms are magnetic , while in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 there are 2 magnetic sub - lattices .",
    "this raises the question whether the ordering of the eu moments around 20 k in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 is aided by the interaction with the fe spins or just due to eu - eu interaction . in order to estimate the strength of the eu and fe sub - lattice interaction we performed fixed spin moment calculations within the lsda+@xmath9 formalism , for ferromagnetic eu and fe sublattices .",
    "it is energetically favorable by 2.5 mev / f.u . to have the eu and fe moments parallel to each other rather than antiparallel .",
    "since the eu 4@xmath8 states are quite localized , we can map the energy difference from our fixed spin moment calculations onto a simple heisenberg model to get an estimate for an effective nearest neighbor exchange ( j@xmath35 ) between the eu and fe sub - lattice .",
    "we obtain a value of about 1 k for j@xmath35 which is rather small compared to the experimental ordering temperature for the eu moments ( @xmath22 20 k ) .",
    "this implies that the eu and fe sub - lattices are quite decoupled in this system .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling allows an estimate of the spin anisotropy for the compound . comparing the total energies for fe 3@xmath34 spins laying the basal plane ( along 100 ) and fe spins pointing along the @xmath16 axis ( along 001 ) we find an easy plane anisotropy of about 0.15 mev per fe site .",
    "our result is consistent with the magnetic structure proposed by recent neutron scattering measurements on the magnetic homologue bafe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite . for the s=7/2 eu@xmath13 ion",
    ", we obtain a negligible ( easy axis ) anisotropy at the border of numerical accuracy in agreement with the expectations for a spherical half filled 4@xmath8 shell .",
    "to investigate the possibility of a pressure induced valency change of the eu from 2 + to 3 + , we performed a series of calculations for reduced unit cell volumes of eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "we maintained a constant @xmath36 ratio and a constant as @xmath12 parameter .",
    "for up to a 35% reduction of the experimental volume , we did not observe evidence for a change in the valency of the eu ion .",
    "this result suggests that , only for very high pressures of the order of 50 gpa or above a valence change of eu might be expected .",
    "we have grown single crystals of eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 using a bridgman technique in a closed ta crucible .",
    "measurements of the electrical resistivity and the specific heat clearly establish the magnetic ordering of localised eu - moments at @xmath37  k and itinerant fe moments at @xmath38  k. band structure calculations reveal a close similarity of the electronic structure of eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 and srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the eu and fe@xmath0as@xmath0 sub - lattice are nearly de - coupled with fe spins preferably oriented within the @xmath39 plane .",
    "our preliminary attempt to dope k in place of eu did not produce a superconducting ground state .",
    "further doping experiments are highly desirable to study possible superconductivty in this compound and its interplay with the eu magnetic moments .",
