    ", we have that @xmath10    in 1983 , harten  @xcite introduced the now classical concept of tvd ( total - variation - diminishing ) numerical schemes ; i.e.  schemes that respect on the discrete level . the discrete _ total variation _ ( tv ) at time step @xmath11 is defined as    [ eq : deftvd ] @xmath12 a numerical scheme for is said to be _ total variation diminishing _ ( tvd ) if @xmath13    the introduction of this strong nonlinear stability condition spawned an intensive research activity in the eighties . in particular ,",
    "the tvd framework provided a convenient setting for generalizing the muscl approach of van leer  @xcite for obtaining _ high resolution _ schemes , i.e.  schemes that achieve second - order accuracy in smooth regions while preserving the robustness of first - order schemes near extrema and discontinuities  @xcite .",
    "it follows from the lax - wendroff theorem  @xcite that tvd schemes in the form will converge to a weak solution , but not necessarily the correct entropy solution  @xcite , of the scalar initial value problem .",
    "explicit schemes in the form suffer from the well - known restriction on the time step denoted as the _ courant - friedrichs - lewy _ ( cfl ) condition  @xcite . in particular , a _ necessary _",
    "condition for stability is @xmath14 where the dimensionless time parameter @xmath15 is called the _ courant number _ and @xmath16 are the eigenvalues of @xmath2 .",
    "there is an intricate relationship between _ stability _ and _ accuracy _ of numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "nonlinear equations will develop discontinuities in finite time , causing oscillations for high - order methods due to the gibbs phenomenon . in this respect ,",
    "most studies on @xmath0 point schemes have focused on employing extended stencils to improve accuracy rather than extending stability  @xcite , and typically the cfl condition will reduce to @xmath17 regardless of the size of the stencil .",
    "classically , the strategy of choice to overcome has been _ implicit schemes _",
    "@xcite , i.e. methods where the numerical flux is evaluated at time level @xmath18 . in particular , if is modified as @xmath19 then is said to be an _",
    "implicit _ scheme .",
    "harten  @xcite provided tvd conditions for hybrid explicit - implicit schemes . in particular , implicit schemes can be tvd without any restriction on the time step , at the cost of excessive numerical diffusion .",
    "the observations    * explicit schemes are commonly limited by the strict time step restriction  ; * implicit schemes suffer from excessive numerical diffusion ;    motivate the study of multi - point schemes in the form , with the aim of obtaining the relaxed time step restriction .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we will refer to such schemes as _ large time step _ ( lts ) schemes .",
    "theoretical foundations for this approach were established several decades ago  @xcite .",
    "the first investigations of concrete large time step explicit schemes were performed in a series of papers by leveque  @xcite . herein , he proposed a generalization of the classical godunov scheme based on treating each wave interaction as linear .",
    "this procedure leads to a consistent and conservative method satisfying the tvd property  @xcite .",
    "extensions to systems were considered in  @xcite .",
    "leveque observed that his scheme would often be highly accurate , but could suffer from artificial staircase solutions and lack of pointwise convergence for systems  @xcite .    in  @xcite , harten proposed a more diffusive ( and robust ) large time step tvd scheme . for linear equations",
    ", his scheme reduces to a repeated application of the standard upwind scheme . through numerical examples ,",
    "harten demonstrated how his modified flux approach ( introduced in  @xcite ) could be extended as a general method to achieve high resolution tvd lts schemes .",
    "nevertheless , the tvd condition is an excessively strict stability criterion . in general",
    ", better accuracy can be achieved from the less restrictive eno  @xcite and weno  @xcite schemes which allow spurious oscillations on the level of the truncation error .",
    "goodman and leveque  @xcite also showed that in 2 space dimensions , any tvd scheme is generally at most first - order accurate .",
    "consequently , there was a decline of interest in schemes formulated in the tvd setting , including the lts schemes .",
    "however , even with the present significant advances in computing power , there is still a need to sacrifice accuracy for efficiency in many practical applications .",
    "for instance , simulators for petroleum processing facilities often involve the solution of highly complicated multiphase flow models through several kilometer long pipelines  @xcite .",
    "these simulators are typically based on implicit methods , but we may note that explicit methods in the form are trivially parallelizable whereas implicit methods are not  @xcite .",
    "the current trend of moving towards massively parallel computer hardware then provides motivation for revisiting the large time step class of schemes , and indeed these methods have seen a _ significant revival _ in recent years .",
    "murillo , morales - hernndez and co - workers  @xcite have investigated variations of leveque s lts scheme , based on roe upwinding , for the 1d and 2d shallow water equations .",
    "herein , an emphasis was made on the proper treatment of source terms and boundary conditions .",
    "qian and lee  @xcite successfully extended leveque s lts - godunov scheme to the full 3d euler equations through dimensional splitting . in  @xcite , these authors extended their investigation to some high - resolution lts schemes constructed through harten s  @xcite approach .",
    "xu et al .",
    "@xcite applied the lts - godunov scheme to the 1d shallow water equations .",
    "recently , thompson and moeller  @xcite independently rediscovered the lts - roe algorithm and applied it to maxwell s equations .",
    "all these authors follow leveque  @xcite in conceptually formulating their schemes as _ wave propagation methods _ , and they all observe the following drawbacks :    * _ for systems , oscillations tend to occur for large time steps due to the nonlinear wave interactions_. * _ propagating rarefactions as expansion shocks introduces entropy - violating solutions_.    for convex scalar equations , the rigorous lts - godunov scheme proposed by leveque  @xcite was proved to converge to the correct entropy solution in  @xcite .",
    "this scheme involves explicitly tracking the spreading of each rarefaction wave across several computational cells , whereas the wave propagation algorithm is most naturally formulated in terms of isolated discontinuities .",
    "for this reason , most authors address the issue d2 by resolving rarefactions into sufficiently many individual expansion shocks  @xcite .",
    "for the classical essentially 3-point explicit schemes , we note that both spurious oscillations and entropy violations are typically handled by applying a controlled amount of numerical diffusion  @xcite . for large time step schemes , xu et al .",
    "@xcite remark that the special updating procedure of wave propagation methods prohibits a natural introduction of numerical viscosity .",
    "this remark motivates our current paper .",
    "the primary aim of our paper is to describe a general lts framework where tvd schemes are classified according to their numerical viscosity , and herein explicitly place the common wave propagation schemes of leveque  @xcite . by this",
    "we hope to lay a foundation for further systematic development and improvement of explicit lts schemes .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : multi ] , we introduce the concept of _ local _ multi - point schemes and provide the transformation between the viscosity formulation and the flux - difference - splitting formulation of such schemes . through a modified equation analysis , we obtain a useful expression for the total numerical viscosity inherent in the schemes .",
    "we present closed form expressions for the numerical viscosity coefficients of the lts - godunov scheme .    in section  [ sec : tvd ]",
    ", we investigate the tvd conditions for lts schemes .",
    "in particular , we identify the least and most diffusive of the tvd local schemes .",
    "the least diffusive scheme is precisely the lts scheme of leveque where roe upwinding is used in place of the rigorous godunov solver .",
    "the most diffusive scheme can be viewed as a natural extension to large time steps of the classical lax - friedrichs scheme .",
    "we discuss the precise conditions under which lts - godunov contains more numerical viscosity than lts - roe , and how this difference can lead to entropy violations for the lts - roe scheme .    in section  [ sec : systems ] , we propose a natural one - parameter family of local lts - tvd schemes that spans the entire admissible range of numerical viscosity .",
    "we extend our framework to general nonlinear systems of conservation laws through the roe linearization .    in section  [ sec :",
    "simulations ] , we illustrate our concepts through numerical simulations of the burgers equation and the euler system .",
    "our main findings are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",

    "based on the above heuristics , we will now propose a simple alternative entropy fix .",
    "entropy violations arise when a courant number   exactly preserves an expansion shock .",
    "we propose to destabilize this situation by always varying the time step ; at each time level we replace the fixed global courant number @xmath15 as defined in with the modification @xmath157 where @xmath158 is sampled from the uniform random distribution @xmath159 .",
    "this ensures that the critical courant numbers will change at each time step , and travelling expansion shocks will be smeared by the projection .",
    "we observe that this fix seems always to work in practice , and examples will be provided in section  [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "note that the fix will not work for the classical @xmath160 transonic rarefaction , as this degenerate case becomes independent of the time step .",
    "we therefore propose to combine the random time step method with a classical entropy fix , for instance the fix of harten  @xcite , to be able to handle expansion shocks of arbitrary velocity .",
    "the scheme defined by the viscosity coefficients    [ eq : qroestar ] @xmath161    for some @xmath162 , subject to time stepping according to , will be denoted as the * lts - roe * * scheme .",
    "similarly to , we can calculate from the total numerical viscosity for lts - lxf : @xmath163 hence by and theorem  [ thm : theoq ] we have the sharp inequality for the numerical viscosity of @xmath4-point local tvd schemes : @xmath164 now 3-point schemes are uniquely defined through their numerical viscosity , but as remarked by tadmor  @xcite , this does not hold when @xmath165 ; different @xmath4-point schemes   may give the same @xmath118 for some given @xmath166 .",
    "we would however be interested in a simple constructive procedure that would give us a local tvd scheme with a target numerical viscosity satisfying  .",
    "in particular , we aim for a parametrization @xmath167 , @xmath168 $ ] with the following properties :    * @xmath169 satisfy the tvd conditions unconditionally ; * @xmath170 is a strictly monotonically increasing function of @xmath171 ; * @xmath172 ; * @xmath173 .    as any convex combination of tvd fluxes",
    "is tvd , this can be easily achieved .    the @xmath4-point scheme given by @xmath174",
    "will be denoted as the lts - roelxf(@xmath171 ) scheme .",
    "herein , p1-p4 will continue to hold if @xmath171 is chosen individually at each cell interface at each time step .",
    "this lts - roelxf(@xmath171 ) method is not unique in satisfying p1-p4 , nor do we claim it is the optimal such scheme .",
    "rather , our intent is to concretely demonstrate that the level of numerical diffusion may be controlled in the large time step tvd setting .",
    "this may be of particular relevance when we consider the extension to systems of nonlinear equations , as nonlinear interactions between the characteristic fields may induce numerical instabilities  @xcite .      as there is no analogue of the tvd property for general nonlinear systems of equations",
    ", we will follow the standard approach  @xcite of applying the scalar framework to a field - by - field decomposition obtained through the roe linearization .",
    "consider now the class of scalar local multi - point schemes where the flux - difference splitting coefficients can be expressed as @xmath175 where @xmath35 is the signed local cell interface courant number .",
    "this class of schemes naturally arises in the tvd setting , as @xmath35 is the only cell interface parameter featured in the tvd conditions  .",
    "in particular , note that both lts - roe and lts - lxf ( but not lts - godunov ) belong to this class of schemes",
    ". then the lts - roe scheme for systems , described in proposition  [ prop : roesys ] , may be naturally generalized as follows ; given the roe matrix  , construct the flux - difference splitting coefficients as @xmath176 where for each eigenvalue we define @xmath177 where @xmath178 are the functions   defining the scalar version of the scheme .",
    "herein , we may apply different schemes to the different characteristic families of .",
    "note that also for nonlinear systems , applying this procedure componentwise to the lax - friedrichs coefficients reduces the scheme to exactly  .",
    "we will now provide some numerical illustrations on the relationship between numerical viscosity and entropy violations .",
    "we consider the burgers equation in one space dimension :    [ eq : burgers ] @xmath179    we use a grid of 800 computational cells covering @xmath180 $ ] , and a courant number @xmath181 .",
    "furthermore , the parameter @xmath182 is used for harten s entropy fix .",
    "we consider the square initial data conditions : @xmath183 the solution after @xmath184 is plotted in figure  [ fig : schemes_square ] for various schemes .",

    "we observe that lts - roe splits the rarefaction wave into a number of entropy - violating expansion shocks , whereas the other schemes all produce a satisfactory resolution of the rarefaction wave .    in figure",
    "[ fig : square_beta ] , various values for @xmath171 in the lts - roelxf(@xmath171 ) scheme are considered .",
    "we observe that increasing @xmath171 leads to the expected increase in numerical diffusion , and recovers the entropy - satisfying rarefaction wave for even small values of @xmath171 .",
    "we now wish to focus on the classical case of the transonic rarefaction , where entropy violations are expected also for low courant numbers .",
    "we consider the initial conditions @xmath186 results are plotted in figure  [ fig : transonic ] .",

    "on the other hand , from figure  [ fig : entsat ] we see that both the full lts - roe * scheme and the lts - roelxf(0.2 ) scheme resolve the rarefaction on par with the lts - godunov scheme .",
    "we consider the classical sod shock tube problem for the euler equations of gas dynamics , described in detail in  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : sod ] , a comparison between lts - roe and lts - roe * after @xmath187 for different courant numbers is presented .",

    "the time stepping of the lts - roe * scheme once more removes these entropy violations .",
    "0.47 , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=100.0% ]    0.47 , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=100.0% ]    however , figure  [ fig : sod2 ] displays spurious oscillations associated with lts - roe * which reduce with grid refinement . for comparison",
    ", the same grid refinement study is performed on the lts - roelxf(@xmath171 ) scheme , were we adapt @xmath171 to the grid size acccording to @xmath188 this choice introduces a significant amount of numerical diffusion , eliminating both the spurious oscillations and entropy violations .",
    "the quality of the numerical solutions will start to suffer by a further increase of the courant number .",
    "in this paper , we have expanded on classical works on multi - point tvd schemes , obtaining some original precise statements . in particular , by considering the restricted class of _ local _ multi - point schemes we were able to obtain the necessary and sufficient tvd conditions .",
    "the coefficients of these conditions are directly linked to the numerical viscosity through the modified equation analysis .",
    "a main result of our paper is proposition  [ prop : qgod ] , where we provide closed form expressions for these coefficients for leveque s lts - godunov scheme . by this , the lts - godunov scheme is explicitly placed in the numerical viscosity tvd framework .",
    "a second main result is theorem  [ thm : theoq ] , which extends to large time steps harten s result that the lax - friedrichs and roe schemes provide the upper and lower limits for the coefficients of numerical viscosity in local tvd schemes .",
    "we have provided some insights on entropy violations associated with the lts - roe scheme when travelling expansion shocks are aligned with the grid , illustrated with numerical examples .",
