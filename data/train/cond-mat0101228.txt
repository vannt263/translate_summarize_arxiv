    "the study of finite spin systems is not only interesting in its own right but has also important applications for understanding so - called  molecular magnets \" .",
    "the synthesis of these systems has undergone rapid progress in recent years building on successes in coordination and polyoxometalate chemistry @xcite .",
    "each of the identical molecular units can contain as few as two and up to several dozen paramagnetic ions .",
    "the largest paramagnetic molecule synthesized to date , the polyoxometalate \\{mo@xmath3fe@xmath4 } , contains 30 iron ions of spin @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it appears that in the majority of these molecules the localized single - particle magnetic moments (  spins \" ) couple antiferromagnetically and the spectrum is rather well described by the heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "since the dimension of the hilbert space for @xmath1 spins of spin quantum number @xmath6 , given by @xmath7 , grows rapidly with @xmath1 and @xmath6 , the numerical evaluation of all energy eigenvalues may be impossible even if the obvious symmetries of the hamiltonian are exploited @xcite .",
    "hence it is indispensable to resort to approximation methods , either analytical or numerical .",
    "however , it appears also desirable to extend the body of rigorous results on spin systems , which could serve as a basis or source of inspiration for the development of approximate models .",
    "for example , the berezin - lieb inequalities @xcite relating spectral properties of the quantum systems to those of their classical counterparts provide a foundation for classical or semi - classical treatments of spin systems . among the berezin - lieb inequalities are the following rigorous estimates @xmath8 for the ground state energy @xmath9 of quite general heisenberg model systems , where @xmath10 denotes the minimal energy of the corresponding classical spin system described with unit vectors .    in this article",
    "we extend the findings of lieb and berezin and prove similar inequalities for the extremal values @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the energy levels belonging to a given quantum number @xmath0 of the total spin .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath0-resolved eigenvalue spectrum is bounded by two parabolas .",
    "the proof rests mainly on a linear transformation of the spin observables according to the eigenbasis of the coupling matrix @xmath13 .",
    "the bounding parabolas depend only on @xmath14 and three special eigenvalues @xmath15 of @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath16 , which is satisfied for all systems where @xmath10 has been determined ( see @xcite ) , our estimate @xmath17 for @xmath18 improves the lower berezin - lieb estimate , eq .",
    "( [ 0 ] ) .",
    "hence we conjecture that also for arbitrary @xmath0 our bounds yield the correct @xmath19-term of the asymptotic series of @xmath11 and @xmath11 for @xmath20 .",
    "we compare the derived bounds with the actual numerically calculated eigenvalue spectrum for various systems .",
    "as expected , the bounds are rather close to the actual spectrum if @xmath6 is large , but there is a considerable gap for small @xmath6 . for special bipartite systems which we call  homogeneous lieb - mattis systems",
    "\" we have derived a closer lower bound even for small @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , we provide numerical evidence that the bounding parabolas , if properly shifted , turn out to be very good approximations of the true boundaries of the spectrum , which is especially useful for the approximation of low - lying excitations .",
    "we consider spin systems with @xmath1 spin sites , spin quantum number @xmath6 and isotropic heisenberg coupling between all sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 with coupling constants @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the three components of the spin observable @xmath25 at site @xmath21 and , as usual , @xmath26 denote the total spin vector and its various components .",
    "all linear operators occuring in this context operate on a @xmath27-dimensional hilbert space @xmath28 .",
    "the eigenspace of @xmath29 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath30 will be denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "the heisenberg hamilton operator can be written as @xmath32 throughout this letter the coupling constants @xmath23 are assumed to satisfy @xmath33 with @xmath34 being independent of @xmath21 .",
    "the latter may be viewed as a kind of weak homogeneity assumption .",
    "the matrix of coupling constants will be denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "its trace vanishes due to @xmath35 .",
    "being symmetrical , it has a complete set of ( ordered ) eigenvalues @xmath36 .",
    "one of them is the row sum @xmath34 with @xmath37 as the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the matrix @xmath13 restricted to the subspace orthogonal to @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) the largest ( smallest ) eigenvalue of @xmath38 .",
    "since we made no assumptions on the signs of the @xmath23 , it may happen that some of the numbers @xmath42 coincide . in most cases of interest",
    ", the @xmath2-matrix @xmath13 can be easily diagonalized , either analytically or numerically , in contrast to the @xmath43-dimensional hamilton matrix .",
    "we will denote the @xmath44-th normalized eigenvector of @xmath13 by @xmath45 , i.  e.   @xmath46 and @xmath47 where we also allow for the possibility to choose complex eigenvectors .",
    "sums over @xmath48 excluding @xmath49 will be denoted by @xmath50 , where @xmath49 denotes the index ( within the ordered set of all eigenvalues ) of the eigenvalue @xmath34 belonging to the eigenvector @xmath39 .    for later use we will consider a transformation of the spin observables analogous to the transformation onto the eigenbasis of @xmath13 and define    @xmath51 .",
    "the inverse transformation then yields @xmath52 in particular , @xmath53 .",
    "the following lemma follows directly from the definitions :    [ l1 ] @xmath54",
    "our main result is formulated in the following theorem :    [ t1 ]    1 .",
    "the following operator inequality holds : @xmath55 2 .   consequently ,",
    "if @xmath56 is an arbitrary normalized vector lying in the subspace @xmath31 , the following bounds hold for the expectation value of @xmath57 : @xmath58    * proof : * we rewrite the hamiltonian in the following form and conclude @xmath59 using ( [ 3a ] ) , the positivity of @xmath60 , and lemma [ l1 ] .",
    "the other inequality follows analogously.@xmath61    as a check of our theorem [ t1 ] we consider the mean energy @xmath62 within the subspace @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath63 denote the projector onto @xmath31 and define @xmath64 .",
    "then we obtain the following    [ p1 ] @xmath65    anticipating that formula ( [ 8 ] ) for @xmath62 is valid , which is proven in @xcite , this proposition of course follows from theorem [ t1 ] , but we want to give an independent proof of the stated inequalities for the interested reader .    * proof : * since @xmath66 and @xmath67 it follows that @xmath68 moreover , @xmath69 and , analogously , @xmath70 the first inequality of the proposition is equivalent to @xmath71 or @xmath72 but ( [ 12 ] ) follows directly from ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10b ] ) .",
    "the second inequality of the proposition is proven in a completely analogous way .",
    "@xmath61    in the classical limit @xmath73 the bounds of theorem [ t1 ] assume the values @xmath74 it is plausible and can be shown analogously to the proof of theorem [ t1 ] @xcite that the corresponding classical hamilton function assumes only values between these bounds .",
    "the classical parabolas ( [ 13 ] ) , ( [ 13a ] ) intersect in the point @xmath75 which corresponds to the ( quantum or classical ) ferromagnetic ground state . for special systems with nearest neighbour coupling @xmath76 , including the @xmath1-polygon ( ring ) , the cube , and the octahedron , it can be shown that the bounds @xmath77 and @xmath78 are assumed for some classical states @xcite .    for a special class of bipartite spin systems we can extend theorem [ t1 ] and obtain an improved lower bounding parabola .",
    "[ d2 ] let the set of spin sites be divided into two disjoint subsets @xmath79 and @xmath80 such that the coupling constants within @xmath79 or @xmath80 are @xmath81 , but @xmath82 between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the partial row sum @xmath83 of positive entries of @xmath13 will be constant for all rows . hence the same holds for @xmath84 .",
    "further we assume that @xmath13 is irreducible , i.  e.  that the spin system can not be decomposed into unconnected parts .",
    "then the spin system will be called an hlm - system (  homogeneous lieb - mattis system \" , see @xcite ) .",
    "further , we will denote by @xmath85 the ( positive ) difference between the second smallest eigenvalue of @xmath86 and @xmath41 .",
    "it follows that for hlm - systems @xmath87 .",
    "examples are even rings or cubes with suitable coupling .",
    "[ t2 ] for hlm systems the following operator inequality holds : @xmath88    * proof * : due to the hlm - assumption , @xmath13 has an eigenvector @xmath89 with eigenvalue @xmath90 , if the spin sites are suitably permuted . by the theorem of gergorin ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , 7.2 ) , @xmath90 will be the smallest eigenvalue @xmath41 and non - degenerate ( theorem of perron - frobenius , c.f .",
    "@xcite , 9.2 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of @xmath94 within the subspace @xmath95 is assumed for the maximal value of the spin quantum numbers @xmath96 , hence @xmath97 thus we may improve the inequality ( [ 9 ] ) by inserting the following term ( suppressing the @xmath63 ) @xmath98 the last inequality follows from ( [ 18b ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "@xmath61    it may very well be that a derivation of an improved inequality along this line is also possible for other than bipartite systems .",
    "note that we have not yet used symmetry assumptions up to weak homogeneity ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the key point is to obtain better estimates for @xmath99 than those already following from ( [ e-9 ] ) .",
    "in the following figures [ f-1 ] , [ f-2 ] , and [ f-3 ] we present examples for the bounding parabolas .",
    "the energy spectra of fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] have been calculated for the hamilton operator of spin rings with nearest neighbour and next - nearest neighbour interaction @xmath100 where the sum is understood @xmath101 . in fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] we display spectra for a ring with @xmath102 and @xmath103 for various ratios @xmath44 of the two coupling constants .",
    "we also consider the hamiltonian of a system of spins occupying the vertices of a cube as well as of an icosahedron with nearest neighbours interaction of constant strength @xmath76 , see fig .",
    "[ f-2 ] .    in all examples",
    "the bounding parabolas provide rigorous bounds , but unfortunately not very narrow ones , especially for small @xmath6 . only in the cases of bipartite systems",
    "the lower bound is impressively close to the boundary of the true spectrum , even if @xmath6 is small .",
    "from the figures it appears that the extremal values @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the exact energy spectrum also lie on approximate parabolas . this is not a novel observation . it has been noted on several occasions , that for heisenberg rings with antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbour interaction and with an even number @xmath1 of sites the set of minimal energies @xmath11 forms a rotational band @xcite .",
    "further examples , including rings for both even and odd @xmath1 , tetrahedra , cubes , octahedra , icosahedra , triangular prisms , and axially truncated icosahedra , suggest that this  rotational band structure hypothesis \" holds for general heisenberg spin systems @xcite .",
    "the parabolas of our theorem [ t1 ] have a similar curvature but a different shift constant compared with the rotational bands .",
    "if they are shifted in such a way , that they meet the highest level of the rotational band , which occurs for @xmath104 , the resulting approximation is very close to the true boundaries of the spectrum , compare the thin curves in figures [ f-1 ] , [ f-2 ] , and [ f-3 ] .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the shifted parabolas exactly meet the minimal and maximal energies of @xmath105 @xmath106 identifying the curvature for the lower parabola with @xmath107 provides a very useful approximation for the curvature of the true low - lying rotational band , and thus complements the derivations of @xcite which are based on the sublattice structure of the spin array .",
    "the classical counterparts @xmath77 and @xmath78 of the bounding parabolas are also rather close to the true boundaries of the spectrum .      the overwhelming numerical evidence for the existence of a rotaional band of minimal energies @xcite @xmath108 for general heisenberg spin systems can not be mere coincidence .",
