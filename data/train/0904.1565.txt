    "the experimentally observed change of sign of @xmath44 may be caused by extrinsic influences , not accessible by the model , such as the increasing density of threading dislocations in the ( ga , mn)as/(in , ga)as layers with increasing in concentration .",

    "neglecting the small influence of @xmath154 in our samples at 4.2k , the critical strain @xmath190 , where a reorientation of the easy axis from out - of - plane to in - plane occurs , can be estimated from the condition @xmath54+@xmath44=@xmath43 .",

    "remarkably , these values are very close to the @xmath10 values in fig .  [ b4 ] where @xmath44 changes sign .",
    "since the ma sensitively depends on the individual growth conditions , care has to be taken when comparing the values of anisotropy parameters published by different groups . keeping this restriction in mind , the data presented in this work are in reasonable agreement , e.g. , with the results obtained by liu et al.@xcite for a representative pair of compressively and tensily strained ( ga , mn)as samples with 3% mn .",
    "changing the magnetization of a ferromagnet , e.g. by an external magnetic field , leads to a variation of its geometrical shape . for crystals with cubic symmetry ,",

    "the strain was found to have no significant influence on the hole concentration , the curie temperature , and the relaxed lattice parameter .",
    "angle - dependent magnetotransport measurements were performed to determine the uniaxial and cubic anisotropy parameters .",

    "the magnetostriction constant @xmath195 was determined . while @xmath208 and @xmath43 are nearly strain independent , @xmath44 changes sign when the magnetic easy axis flips from in - plane to out - of - plane .",

    "<S> we present a systematic study on the influence of epitaxial strain and hole concentration on the magnetic anisotropy in ( ga , mn)as at 4.2k . </S>",
    "<S> the strain was gradually varied over a wide range from tensile to compressive by growing a series of ( ga , mn)as layers with 5% mn on relaxed graded ( in , ga)as / gaas templates with different in concentration . the hole density , the curie temperature , and the relaxed lattice constant of the as - grown and annealed ( ga , mn)as layers turned out to be essentially unaffected by the strain . </S>",
    "<S> angle - dependent magnetotransport measurements performed at different magnetic field strengths were used to probe the magnetic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements reveal a pronounced linear dependence of the uniaxial out - of - plane anisotropy on both strain and hole density . whereas the uniaxial and cubic in - plane anisotropies are nearly constant , the cubic out - of - plane anisotropy changes sign when the magnetic easy axis flips from in - plane to out - of - plane . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results for the magnetic anisotropy are quantitatively compared with calculations of the free energy based on a mean - field zener model . an almost perfect agreement between experiment and theory </S>",
    "<S> is found for the uniaxial out - of - plane and cubic in - plane anisotropy parameters of the as - grown samples . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , magnetostriction constants are derived from the anisotropy data . </S>"
