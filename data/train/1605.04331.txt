    "the numerous processes occurs in the electron bunch moving in the medium with the refractive index more than unity @xcite .",
    "cherenkov instability is one of them .",
    "as was demonstrated in @xcite , the instability evolves in the electron bunch even in the absence of an external action . at the initial stage ,",
    "the instability is accompanied by particle bunching and exponential growth of the radiated power .",
    "this exponential growth is then stopped due to nonlinearity , and the pulse of cherenkov superradiance is formed .",
    "the influence of different parameters on the peak power of cherenkov superradiance was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite also assumed that the particles having the same initial energy undergo phase pre - modulation at the radiation frequency . as a result of phase pre - modulation ,",
    "the electromagnetic oscillations start with spontaneous coherent emission from all particles rather than with spontaneous emission from individual electrons of a bunch",
    ".    however , it seems interesting to know the behavior of cherenkov superradiance without pre - modulation , in which case the generation starts as spontaneous emission of electromagnetic waves from individual particles . to give a correct description of cherenkov superradiance in this case",
    ", we need to consider statistical fluctuations due to shot noise and energy spread of electrons inherent in particle ensembles @xcite .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that because of shot noise in single - pass fels , the radiated power and the instability growth time become stochastic quantities whose root - mean - square deviations have the same order of magnitude as their average values",
    ".    this paper studies the statistical properties of cherenkov and quasi - cherenkov superradiance without phase pre - modulation when the emission of electromagnetic waves begins with spontaneous emission from individual particles .",
    "the peak radiated power and the instability growth time are taken as stochastic quantities for statistical analysis .",
    "the peak power is the main output characteristic of short - pulse sources of electromagnetic radiation and the instability growth time is the parameter defining the minimum particle passage time in the generator that is necessary for the superradiant instability to evolve .",
    "the paper s outline is as follows .",
    "first , we derive a system of equations describing the interaction of charged particles with the radiation field in the medium .",
    "further comes a detailed consideration of statistical properties of cherenkov @xcite and quasi - cherenkov @xcite superradiance in the presence of shot noise alone and then the energy spread of electrons is added .",
    "the energy spread of electrons will appear to be an important factor limiting the peak radiated power of cherenkov superradiance .",
    "let us consider the electron bunch of length @xmath0 .",
    "the bunch is directed by a strong longitudinal magnetic field . as a result , there is no transverse displacement of particles .",
    "the effective interaction between the bunch and the electromagnetic wave is provided by cherenkov synchronism condition : the electron velocity @xmath1 is close to the phase velocity @xmath2 .    within the beam region , the radiation field",
    "is assumed to have a form @xmath3 where the frequency @xmath4 satisfies the equation @xmath5 and the slowly varying complex amplitude of the wave @xmath6 satisfies the conditions : @xmath7 in this case , the excitation equation for @xmath6 can be written as follows @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the group velocity , @xmath10 is the coupling impedance , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the slowly varying complex amplitude of the current @xmath13 .",
    "now , let us turn to the analysis of the electron motion .",
    "for this purpose , we assume that all charged particles located within the interval @xmath14 $ ] are affected by the same force determined by the amplitude @xmath6 at point @xmath15 . as a result , the equations of particle motion has the following form : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the charge and mass of the electron repectively , @xmath19 is the lorenz factor , and @xmath20 is the paticle phase in the electromagnetic wave .",
    "let us introduce the average current density : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of particles in the interval @xmath14 $ ] .    using and coordinate transformation @xmath23 we rewrite equation as follows @xmath24    for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the substitution of dimensionless quantities @xmath27{v_0 ^ 2v_{gr}},\\\\ & c=\\frac{ei_{av}k}{2\\gamma_0 ^ 3mc^2},\\\\ & z = c\\beta \\tilde x\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{v_0 ^ 2v_{gr}}}{v_0-v_{gr}},\\\\ & f=\\frac{ee_0}{\\gamma_0 ^ 3mc^2\\beta c^2}\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{v_0 ^ 2v_{gr}}}{v_{gr}},\\\\ & \\nu=2c\\gamma_0 ^ 2\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{v_{gr}}{v_0}},\\\\ & \\xi = c\\beta l\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{v_0 ^ 2v_{gr}}}{v_0-v_{gr}}\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] into and yields to the set of equations @xmath28 which should be supplemented with boundary and initial conditions @xmath29 where @xmath30 are random variables uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath31 .",
    "one of the main parameters of short - pulse sources is the convertion ratio equal to the peak radiated power to the electron flow power ratio . in dimensionless units ,",
    "@xmath32 is given by the expression @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the peak value of the dimensionless amplitude @xmath35 .",
    "further , we shall use the reduced conversion ratio @xmath36 instead of @xmath32 .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 differs from @xmath32 by the numerical factor @xmath38 .",
    "as follows from , the behavior of charged particles in the absence of the energy spread is determined by three controlling parameters : the bunch length @xmath39 , the nonlinearity parameter @xmath40 , and the number of particles @xmath41 .",
    "hence , to explore the statistical properties of cherenkov superradiance , we need to solve the set of equations for various values of the controlling parameters . because the initial phases @xmath42 are randomly distributed , the numerical experiment with each triple of values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 must be repeated many times",
    ". this procedure will give information about statistical characteristics of cherenkov superradiance , the most important of which are the reduced conversion ratio @xmath37 , the instability growth time @xmath43 , and their relative root - mean - square deviations @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "+     +    in the numerical analysis of statistical fluctuations of cherenkov superradiance in the presence of shot noise , instead of the number @xmath41 of real electrons , we took the number @xmath46 of large electrons with initial phases equal to @xmath47 where @xmath30 are random variables uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath31 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this procedure , boosting the performance of the program , simulates the shot noise correctly .",
    "we selected the following values of the controlling parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath49@xmath50 , and @xmath51@xmath52 .",
    "the numerical experiment with each ( @xmath41,@xmath39,@xmath40 ) triple was repeated 100 times .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the results of computation from which we can draw two very important conclusions .",
    "first , the instability growth time and the peak radiated power , which is proportional to the reduced conversion ratio , are weakly dependent on the number of particles @xmath41 . in accordance with @xcite ,",
    "the peak power increases with the bunch length @xmath39 .",
    "second , the root - mean square deviations of @xmath37 and @xmath43 are inversely propotional to the square root of the number of particles : @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    at present",
    ", the electron beams for generating cherenkov superradiance are obtained at high - current accelerators with explosive emission cathodes . due to explosive electron emission",
    ", charged particles leave the cathode in separate portions , called ectons .",
    "a typical current of each ecton is @xmath55  a. the total current @xmath13 produced by an accelerator is several kiloamperes . as a result , in estimating the fluctuations we should use the number of ectons @xmath56 instead of @xmath41 . let the total current @xmath13 be 2.6  ka , then we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "let us note that the root - mean - square deviations are of the same order of magnitude as their averages .",
    "to take account of the electron energy spread , we assume the initial quantities @xmath59 to be gaussian random variables whose averages equal zero and the root - mean - square deviations @xmath60{\\frac{v_0}{v_{gr}}}$ ] ( @xmath61 is the root - mean - square deviation of the lorenz factor ) .     +    analyzing the results of numerical experiments",
    ", we can see that the energy spread leads to a sharp drop in the radiated power ( fig .",
    "3 ) , especially at high currents ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this is well - illustrated by the example in fig .",
    "3 , where the growing influence of the energy spread with larger @xmath62 is seen clearly : the energy spread leads to a stronger suppression of radiation at large @xmath40 .",
    "this section considers quasi - cherenkov superradiance emitted by electron bunches when charged particles pass through crystals ( natural or artificial ) under the conditions of dynamical diffraction of electromagnetic waves .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case when the roots of the dispersion equation describing interaction between particles and electromagnetic waves do nt coincide .",
    "the latter case demands more detailed computer simulations .",
    "this will be done in subsequent papers .    in the periodic structures , along with the electromagnetic wave emitted in the forward direction @xmath63",
    ", one can observe the electromagnetic wave that is emitted by charged particles in the diffraction direction @xmath64 and leaves the crystal through the bunch entrance surface .",
    "the set of equations analogues to should be rewritten as follows : @xmath65 here , @xmath66 and @xmath39 are defined as @xmath67{v_0 ^ 2/v_{gr}^2}$ ] and @xmath68{v_0 ^ 2/v_{gr}^2}$ ] instead of .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 in is proportional to the dielectric susceptibility @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the equations should be supplemented with boundary and initial conditions @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a crystal thickness and @xmath30 are random variables uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath31 .    in dimensionless units ,",
    "the reduced conversion ratios are given by the expressions @xmath73    we shall assume that @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "for this case , the peak intensity of cooperative radiation emitted in forward and backward directions is investigated as a function of the crystal thickness @xmath72 .",
    "the peak radiation intensity @xmath37 appeared to increase monotonically until saturation is achieved ( fig .",
    "4 ) . at saturation ,",
    "fluctuations in the intensity of radiation undergo a sharp drop . the growth of parameter @xmath69 results in decreasing @xmath37 and increasing @xmath76 ( fig . 5 , 6 ) .",
    "we would like to note the fluctuations of quasi - cherenkov superradiance under dynamical diffraction conditions correlate well with the results obtained in the previous section for cherenkov radiation .",
