    "radio frequency ( rf ) signal enabled wireless energy transfer ( wet ) has become a promising technology to provide perpetual , cost - effective , and convenient energy supply to low - power wireless devices such as rf identification ( rfid ) tags and sensor nodes for various low - power applications in future smart commercial and industrial systems with wireless internet - of - things ( iot ) @xcite . in rf - based wet systems , dedicated energy transmitters ( ets )",
    "are deployed to control and coordinate the transfer of wireless energy via rf signals to a set of distributed energy receivers ( ers ) , and each er uses the rectifier at each of its receive antennas ( also known as rectennas as a whole ) to convert the received rf signals to direct current ( dc ) signals , which are combined to charge the battery at the er @xcite ( see , e.g. , a point - to - point wet system in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] ) .",
    "examples of commercial ers include the p2110 and p2210 powerharvester receivers developed by the powercast company @xcite .",
    "due to the long operating range ( say , tens of meters ) and flexibility to charge multiple devices at the same time ( thanks to the broadcast property of radio signal ) , rf - based far - field wet has competitive advantages over existing near - field wet techniques such as induction coupling , which generally operates with much shorter distance ( say , centimeters ) and for point - to - point power transfer only @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since rf signal can carry energy as well as modulated information at the same time , a joint investigation of wireless information and energy transfer is appealing , which has recently drawn a great amount of attention .",
    "in particular , simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and wireless powered communication network ( wpcn ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) are two important operation models that have been thoroughly studied in literature . in swipt systems , wireless information and energy",
    "are transmitted using the same signal ; while in wpcn , wireless information transmission is powered by wet using different signals .",
    "= 1     one major practical challenge for implementing rf - based wet is the significant decay of energy transfer efficiency of wet over the distance from the et to the er due to the severe prorogation power loss of rf signal . to improve the efficiency , multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques by equipping multiple antennas at the et and/or the",
    "er have been proposed as an appealing solution ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "multiple antennas at the et help focus the transmitted wireless energy on the direction to the er via the technique of digital beamforming or so - called energy beamforming , while multiple antennas at the er increase the effective aperture area for received rf energy harvesting , both leading to significantly enhanced energy transfer efficiency .",
    "this helps extend the operating range of wet with given ers energy requirements , and/or enable more power - consuming applications by increasing ers harvested energy with fixed distances . however , the benefit of energy beamforming in mimo wet critically relies on the availability of the channel state information ( csi ) at the et , which needs to be efficiently learned in practical systems .",
    "there are in general three types of channel acquisition methods that have been proposed in the literature for mimo wet .",
    "the first method is by exploiting the channel reciprocity between the forward ( from the et to the er ) and reverse ( from the er to the et ) links @xcite , where the et obtains the forward link csi by performing a reverse link channel estimation based on the training signals sent by the er . it is worth noting that this method is only applicable for time - division duplex ( tdd ) based systems , where the condition of channel reciprocity practically holds with good accuracy .",
    "the second method is via sending training signals directly in the forward link from the et to the er , through which the er estimates the mimo channel and then sends the estimated channel back to the et via the reverse link @xcite .",
    "this method is reminiscent of the conventional channel estimation and feedback approach in wireless communication ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) , which is applicable for both tdd and frequency - division duplex ( fdd ) based systems .",
    "however , under the new setup of wet ( instead of wireless communication ) , this method requires the er ( not an information receiver ) to implement additional baseband signal processing for channel estimation , which is not feasible with the existing hardware at the er designed only for rf energy harvesting ( instead of information decoding ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .    to cater for the hardware limitation of existing ers , in our previous work @xcite",
    "we proposed a third channel learning method for mimo wet based on the energy measurement feedback by the er . specifically , the er measures its harvested energy levels over different training intervals using an energy meter ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] ) , and sends one feedback bit to the et per interval to indicate the increase or decrease of the measured energy in the current interval as compared to that in the previous interval .",
    "based on the feedback bits collected in the present and past intervals , the et adjusts its transmit beamforming in subsequent training intervals and obtains refined estimates of the mimo channel .",
    "note that similar channel learning methods with one - bit feedback have also been studied in cognitive radio mimo systems @xcite .",
    "this energy feedback based channel learning method is applicable for both tdd and fdd systems , and can be implemented without additional baseband processing modules at the er . however , the existing studies in @xcite considered only one feedback bit per training interval ; while it remains unknown how to efficiently implement this method for the general setup with multiple feedback bits available per interval .",
    "this thus motivates our study in this work .",
    "in this paper , we propose a general channel learning design framework for mimo wet based on the er s energy feedback over a finite - rate reverse link from the er to the et ( thus including the one - bit feedback per interval designed in @xcite as a special case ) .",
    "note that our results can also be similarly applied to other applications for channel learning in wireless communications with received signal power / energy based feedback ( such as cognitive radio systems in @xcite ) .",
    "we consider a quasi - static channel model and a block - based energy transmission with each block spanning over a constant mimo channel for wet .",
    "each block is further divided into two phases for channel learning and energy transmission , respectively . in the channel learning phase",
    ", the et learns the mimo channel progressively by adjusting its training beamforming weights according to the received energy feedback from the er .",
    "it is assumed that at each feedback interval the er sends @xmath0 bits to the et via the reverse link . in general , the feedback bits at each interval are generated by the er via efficiently encoding the measured energy levels at the present and past intervals subject to the given feedback rate constraint . based on the estimated mimo channel from the channel learning phase , in the subsequent energy transmission phase , the et implements the optimal transmit energy beamforming to maximize the energy transferred to the er . in this paper , we focus our study on the channel learning phase by investigating the energy feedback design at the er and the training beamforming design and channel estimation method at the et .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .    *",
    "first , we present a general design framework for the energy measurement feedback based channel learning with limited feedback rate .",
    "similar to @xcite for the special case of one - bit feedback ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) , our design is based on the technique of analytic center cutting plane method ( accpm ) in convex optimization @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of accpm is as follows : based on the @xmath2 feedback bits from the er at each interval , the et constructs one or more linear inequalities on the mimo channel matrix to be estimated , where each inequality is used as a cutting plane for helping localize the mimo channel in a multi - dimensional complex matrix space .",
    "based on these cutting planes , the et also designs the transmit beamforming for subsequent training intervals and obtains refined estimates of the mimo channel .",
    "* under this general framework , we then propose two specific feedback designs , namely , energy quantization and energy comparison , where the @xmath2 feedback bits per interval are generated at the er by quantizing the measured energy level at the current interval and comparing it with those in the @xmath2 previous intervals , respectively .",
    "note that when @xmath1 , the energy comparison based channel learning scheme degenerates to that with one - bit feedback per interval as in our previous work @xcite .",
    "* finally , we provide extensive numerical results to compare the performance of our proposed feedback and channel learning schemes in terms of both mean - squared error of the estimated mimo channel norm as well as the resulting energy beamforming gain .",
    "it is shown that energy quantization generally preforms better than energy comparison when @xmath2 is large , while energy comparison is more effective vice versa .",

    "let the block length be denoted by @xmath29 , which is assumed to be sufficiently long for typical wet applications with low mobility receivers .",
    "we consider transmit beamforming at the et for wet . without loss of generality",

    "accordingly , the transmit covariance matrix at the et is given by @xmath37 . note that for any given transmit covariance matrix @xmath3 , the corresponding energy beamforming vectors , i.e. , @xmath38 , can be obtained via performing the eigenvalue decomposition ( evd ) on @xmath3 , where @xmath39 .",

    ", we present the energy signal design with or without csi at the et .",
    "first , consider that the et perfectly knows the csi . in this case , the et designs the energy beamforming to maximize its transferred energy to the er subject to the given transmit sum - power constraint .",
    "mathematically , the transferred energy maximization problem is formulated as @xmath49 let the @xmath50 eigenvalues of @xmath51 be denoted by @xmath52 , and the corresponding eigenvectors by @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "then it is shown in @xcite that the optimal solution to problem ( [ eqn : problem2 ] ) is given by @xmath54 , which achieves the maximum transferred energy to the er given by @xmath55 here , it follows that @xmath56 ; as a result , only one single transmit energy beam is needed to achieve the optimality .",
    "such a single - beam solution is termed as _ optimal energy beamforming ( oeb)_.    on the other hand , consider the case when the et does not have any knowledge about the csi . in this case , the oeb is not implementable .",
    "alternatively , the et can employ an isotropic transmission to radiate its transmit power uniformly over all directions , with the corresponding transmit covariance matrix given by @xmath57 .",
    "correspondingly , the harvested energy at the er is expressed as @xmath58    by comparing @xmath59 in ( [ eqn : qoeb ] ) and @xmath60 in ( [ eqn : qiso ] ) , it is observed that the oeb with perfect csi at the et offers an energy beamforming gain over the isotropic transmission without csi , which can be expressed as @xmath61 due to the fact that @xmath52 , it is evident that @xmath62 , where @xmath63 holds when @xmath64 ( with @xmath65 ) , while @xmath66 is attained when @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) . for practical wet systems with @xmath70",
    ", we normally have @xmath71 ( and @xmath72 if @xmath73 ) , since the wireless channel is often line - of - sight ( los ) dominant given the limited transmission range of most interest ( say , several meters ) .",
    "in this case , an energy beamforming gain @xmath74 can be achieved with the availability of csi at the et .",
    "= 1     to achieve the promising energy beamforming gain in practice , we consider a two - phase transmission protocol for the et to learn the mimo channel and based on the estimated channel implement the oeb . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol ] , each transmission block is divided into two phases , for the purposes of channel learning and energy transmission , respectively .",
    "we explain these two phases in detail as follows .",
    "first , the channel learning phase corresponds to the first @xmath75 amount of time in each block , @xmath76 , which is further divided into @xmath77 training intervals .",

    "[ fig : system ] in the first @xmath87 amount of time in each interval , number of multiple - input single - output ( miso ) channels each for one receive antenna .",
    "this can increase the channel learning convergence rate at the cost of higher hardware and feedback costs at the er . ] and then sends back the measured energy information to the et at the remaining @xmath88 amount of time , where @xmath89 . the harvested energy amount measured by the er in the @xmath85-th interval",
    "is denoted by @xmath90 it is assumed that the er can send @xmath2 bits to the et at each interval via the reverse link , where @xmath91 is an integer with @xmath92 denoting the feedback rate from the er to the et .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is practically finite since the er is energy - constrained for sending training signals and the available bandwidth for feedback may be shared among multiple ers ( to their respective ets ) .",
    "we denote the @xmath2-bits feedback at each interval @xmath85 as @xmath93 . in general",
    ", @xmath93 specifies the energy feedback scheme in use at the er which is a mapping from its present and past energy observations ( i.e. , @xmath94 ) to the @xmath2 feedback bits at interval @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath96 and @xmath97 denote the energy consumed by the er for the energy measurement and the information feedback in each interval , respectively .",
    "note that the values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 should be chosen in practice by considering the sensitivity of the energy meter at each er and the feedback link capacity from each er to the et , respectively , as well as the er s energy consumption for energy measurement and feedback .    for the purpose of exposition",
    ", we make the following assumptions on the er s energy measurement and feedback .    *",
    "the energy measurement of each @xmath98 at the er is perfectly accurate , while the effect of energy measurement error at the er on the channel learning performance will be shown by simulation in section [ sec : energymeasurementerror ] . *",
    "the feedback link is ideal and each feedback @xmath93 is received by the et at the end of interval @xmath85 without any error or delay ;    based on the feedback @xmath99 , the et obtains a final estimate of the mimo channel at the end of the channel learning phase .",
    "the details of energy feedback design at the er and training signal design and channel estimation method at the et will be given later .",
    "next , in the energy transmission phase with the remaining time @xmath100 , the et implements the oeb for wet based on the estimated mimo channel from the previous channel learning phase .",
    "let the dominant eigenvector of the estimated mimo channel be denoted by @xmath101 .",
    "then the et sets the transmit covariance matrix in the energy transmission phase as @xmath102 accordingly , the transferred energy to the er is expressed as @xmath103    by combing the channel learning and energy transmission phases , the net energy harvested by the er over one whole block is expressed as its totally harvested energy minus the total energy consumed for energy measurement and feedback , i.e. , @xmath104 accordingly , we define the practical energy beamforming gain achieved by the two - phase protocol as @xmath105 for typical wet applications with @xmath106 being sufficiently large , it follows that @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "furthermore , it can be assumed that the energy consumption @xmath109 and @xmath110 are negligible as compared to the totally harvested energy , i.e. , @xmath111 . versus @xmath100 between channel learning and energy transmission .",
    "due to page limitation , we omit such discussion here and the interested readers can refer to @xcite for details .",
    "] therefore , we approximate the practical energy beamforming gain as @xmath112 for convenience , in the sequel of this paper we use the approximate energy beamforming gain @xmath113 as the performance metric for proposed feedback and channel learning schemes .",
    "note that when the channel estimation is sufficiently accurate , i.e. , @xmath114 , the energy beamforming gain @xmath113 approaches that by the oeb with perfect csi at the et @xmath115 in ( [ eqn : ebgain ] ) , i.e. , @xmath116 .",
    "in this section , we present a general framework for designing the energy feedback at the er and the corresponding training signal and channel estimation at the et based on accpm .",
    "accpm is well known as an efficient localization and cutting plane method for solving convex or quasi - convex optimization problems @xcite , with the objective of finding one feasible point in a convex target set , where the target set can be the set of optimal solutions to the problem of interest .",
    "the implementation of accpm is based on the use of cutting planes , each of which is a hyperplane that separates some of the current points from the points in the target set .",
    "based on the returned cutting planes in each iteration , the target set can be localized via a sequence of convex working sets with reduced size .    to implement accpm in our context",
    ", we first define the target set for channel learning as follows .",
    "note that it follows from ( [ eqn : oeb ] ) that the implementation of oeb at the et in the energy transmission phase only depends on @xmath101 , which is the estimate of the dominant eigenvector of the matrix @xmath117 . for convenience , in the sequel",
    "we denote @xmath51 as the mimo channel to be estimated , instead of the actual mimo channel @xmath118 . to obtain @xmath101",

    "next , we explain the principle for designing the feedback @xmath122 , and show that they in fact play the role of specifying the cutting planes in accpm for localizing @xmath123 . to facilitate the design of @xmath122",
    ", we first set the transmit covariance matrix at the et in the first interval @xmath124 to be @xmath125 ( i.e. , isotropic transmission ) , based on which the corresponding harvested energy amount measured by the er is @xmath126 . by using @xmath127 as a reference energy level ,",
    "we then normalize the harvested energy measurement in each interval @xmath128 as @xmath129 note that for interval @xmath124 , we have @xmath130 ; as a result , the feedback over this interval @xmath131 will not provide any information on @xmath132 and thus can be ignored .",
    "this assumption is made specifically for our proposed channel learning algorithms , while in general it may not be optimal for other designs .",
    "since @xmath133 is a real number but @xmath93 is of @xmath2 bits only , each feedback @xmath93 can not completely convey @xmath134 to the et at interval @xmath85 ; therefore , @xmath93 should be designed by properly encoding the present and past energy measurements , i.e. , @xmath135 , at each interval @xmath136 .",
    "the optimal encoding scheme subject to @xmath2 feedback bits per interval is a difficult problem to solve ; thus we will later propose two suboptimal designs for efficient practical implementation in sections [ sec : quantization : feedback ] and [ sec : comparison : feedback ] , respectively .",
    "for each proposed feedback scheme , a set of new linear inequalities ( or cutting planes in accpm ) on @xmath132 are obtained from @xmath93 at each interval @xmath137 , which are generally expressed as @xmath138 where @xmath139 denotes the number of inequalities / cutting planes obtained at interval @xmath85 , and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are parameters depending on the design of transmit covariance matrix @xmath142 s and feedback @xmath93 s in each scheme ( to be specified later ) .",
