    "a644 was observed with the acis - i ccd array for approximately 30  ks during ao-2 as part of the  guest observer program .",
    "we reduced the data using the ciao v3.1 ( with caldb v2.28 ) and heasoft v5.3.1 software packages .",

    "for the source , we adopted a thin thermal plasma component ( ) with @xmath20  kev and half - solar metallicity .",
    "the background was modeled with components for the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) and instrumental background : two soft  thermal plasmas and a hard power law for the cxb ; a broken power law and two gaussians for the instrumental background .",

    "these deviations from a symmetric configuration , though statistically significant , do not represent large fluctuations ( @xmath22 ) in the mean surface brightness level . in particular , the data do not provide clear evidence for distinct subclumps in the core region",

    "we measure the centroid and the ellipticity of the x - ray surface brightness using the moment method described by @xcite and implemented in our previous x - ray studies of galaxies and clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this iterative method is equivalent to computing the ( two - dimensional ) principal moments of inertia within an elliptical region .",

    "overall , the image properties suggest a relaxed cluster outside about @xmath32  kpc but a disturbed cluster within @xmath33  kpc .",
    "we examined the radial surface brightness profile ( with point sources masked out ) located about the x - ray peak and also about the centroid computed within @xmath27  kpc . in both cases the surface brightness profile is fitted fairly well out to @xmath34  kpc by a @xmath35 model : @xmath36  kpc , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , 129 dof ( peak ) and @xmath39  kpc , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , 128 dof ( centroid ) .",

    "( we emphasize that although the mass values for the inner three data points are shown , being derived from the gas density and temperature models , they are not included in the fits . )",
    "the nfw model is a good smooth fit when excluding the inner three radial bins ( figure [ fig.profile ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath169 for 4 dof with fit residuals @xmath170 .",
    "because the mass data points are correlated it is necessary to recalibrate the @xmath92 statistic to examine goodness of fit using our monte carlo simulations (  [ spec ] ) ; i.e. , for each set of parameters for the gas density and temperature profiles obtained for each simulation , a mass profile is constructed and then fitted with an nfw model .",
    "these simulations indicate the the @xmath92 value quoted above is within one standard deviation of the expected value .    in table",
    "[ tab.mass ] we give the parameters of the nfw fit and the estimated statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the estimates for the systematic errors are mostly based on our discussion in  [ spec ] , and we have also included the differences obtained when using a @xmath133 model to parameterize the  profile .",
    "( note we do not provide an estimated error arising from the deprojection method because the statistical errors are considerably larger when using the onion - peeling method . ) the derived concentration parameter ( @xmath171 ) and virial radius ( @xmath172  mpc ) imply a virial mass of @xmath173 appropriate for a massive galaxy cluster .",
    "the value of @xmath150 is consistent with that expected from cdm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we mention that within the central region ( i.e. , the central three annuli ) , where the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is suspect , the mass density profile is flatter than nfw ; i.e. , the cumulative mass profile at small radii lies below nfw as seen in figure [ fig.profile ]",
    ". however , for the case where the annuli are centered about the emission peak we find the mass profile within the central @xmath174  kpc is highly uncertain but consistent with nfw .",
    "( to obtain a reasonable smooth fit to the centrally peaked temperature profile in this case , we modeled the profile with two power laws with exponential cut - offs at both ends . ) the smaller mass values in the core for the centroid case are attributed to the flatter density and temperature profiles obtained with respect to the peak case ; i.e. , when the annuli are not positioned about the emission peak radial differences in spectral quantities are smeared out .",
    "outside the core ( @xmath0  kpc @xmath1 ) the hot icm has properties consistent with a ( relaxed ) cool - core cluster out to the largest radii investigated ( @xmath2  kpc @xmath175 ) .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness is very regular , moderately elliptical in shape , with no evidence of substructure ; previous  studies generally indicated a relaxed cluster on such scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the radial profile of the density of the icm is fitted well with a single @xmath35 model , with a double @xmath35 model providing slight improvement .",
    "the temperature profile is consistent with isothermal or gently rising ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the entropy factor ( @xmath176 , e.g. , @xmath177  kev  @xmath178 at @xmath179 ) is consistent with those observed in cool - core clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the iron abundance declines with increasing radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the gravitating mass profile is well fitted by an nfw profile with reasonable concentration parameter for a halo of its virial mass .",
    "finally , the gas fraction ( @xmath180 at @xmath179 ) is quite typical of relaxed clusters observed by  and produced in cdm simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    inside the core",
    ", however , the  data reveal an irregular , disturbed system .",
    "the x - ray image displays asymmetrical isophotes about the emission peak which are offset from the global emission centroid by @xmath181  kpc . when oriented about the emission peak , the temperature profile of the icm declines towards the center ( down to @xmath105  kpc ) , very much resembling a cool - core cluster .",
    "but at small radii the temperature profile turns around and increases toward the center ; i.e. , the inner temperature profile is inconsistent with a constant at the @xmath6 level .",
    "both the iron abundances and entropy profiles mirror the shape of the temperature profile with an excess at the center .",
    "since a644 does not possess significant radio emission @xcite , and the  image does not show any x - ray cavities , the suppression of a cooling flow can not be attributed to the present day feedback from an agn . nor",
    "is it easily ascribed to heating by a past radio outburst from the black hole in the cd , because the synchrotron lifetime of 1  ghz - emitting cosmic rays is @xmath182  yr for a magnetic field strength of a few @xmath183gauss in the cluster icm .",
    "since this energy loss timescale is comparable to the sound - crossing time for the cluster core ( and thus to the time needed to heat the core ) , the core should remain hot for about the same time as the 1  ghz radio emission remains visible after heating is terminated .",
    "it is even more difficult to explain heating of the `` hot spot '' ( i.e. , the central `` hot '' radial bin oriented about the emission peak  see figure 2 ) by an agn in the recent past , because an even shorter time since the cessation of cosmic ray injection is required due to its smaller physical size .",
    "nevertheless , a search for a steep - spectrum radio source would be worthwhile .",
    "the absence of low - frequency radio emission ( e.g. , vla low - frequency sky survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would be an even more powerful test against the agn heating model in a644 , because 100  mhz - emitting cosmic rays have three times longer lifetimes in comparable magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , although the higher temperature in the `` hot spot '' appears to be accompanied by a sharp increase in iron abundance , supernovae are a most unlikely heating source for even this small portion of the core because the required number of supernovae would need to be accompanied by a recent , galaxy - sized ( @xmath184 ) starburst .",
    "neither a blue galaxy nor a luminous emission - line nebula are visible in the cluster core of a644 @xcite .    however , the morphological irregularities in the core of the x - ray image are very likely the result of merging . the cd galaxy ( 2masx j08172559 -0730455 )",
    "is located @xmath185  kpc south of the x - ray emission peak nearly along the direction of the centroid shift noted in  [ image ] .",
    "it is also @xmath186  kpc displaced from the centroid of the x - ray emission computed from larger radii .",
    "evidently the cd galaxy and core icm are `` sloshing '' in the potential well of the main cluster , and this energy has prevented the establishment of a cooling flow .",
    "the metallicity peak measured within the innermost radial bin probably indicates that previous merging did not destroy the initial peak , created when it was spatially coincident with the cd galaxy .",
    "this is because , as argued above , the peak is unlikely the result of very recent supernova enrichment . also , the visual appearance of the a644 galaxies is quite diffuse , stretching @xmath187 2 mpc linearly across the sky , suggesting a system far from relaxation .",
    "this morphology strengthens the argument for an on - going merger .",
    "the properties of a644 ( this paper ) , a2029 @xcite , and a2589 @xcite have important similarities .",
    "their x - ray images indicate a peak which is offset from the centroid of the global x - ray halo , with a644 displaying the most extreme shift ( @xmath188  kpc offset ) compared to the others ( a2589 : @xmath189  kpc , a2029 : @xmath190  kpc ) .",
    "other than these offsets , the x - ray emission is very regular in each case with no indications of cavities as are seen in cool - core clusters with agn . )",
    "surface brightness deviations from a smooth elliptical model in the central @xmath191  kpc of a2029 using the ao-1  image , and claim that the wat morphology anitcorrelates with these small fluctuations . using a more recent , deeper ( 80  ks ) chandra exposure we confirm @xmath192 deviations in the surface brightness ( zappacosta et al .",
    "2005 , in prep ) , but we do not confirm a strong anticorrelation with the wat morphology as seen in other cool - core clusters . compared to other cool - core clusters with obvious central disturbances these @xmath192 deviations in the surface brightness , which translate to even smaller ( @xmath193 ) deviations in the gas density , indicate that the core of a2029 is in a much more relaxed state . for comparison",
    ", we find that perseus , a cool - core cluster with an obvious distrurbance in the core , displays up to 50% fluctuations in the surface brightness .",
    "it should be added that , unlike a2029 , perseus also has strong azimuthal fluctuations in the temperature and metallicity which , however , apparently consipire to produce approximate azimuthal balance in the gas pressure and therefore approximate hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite . ]",
    "two of these clusters have no detected agn radio emission , while a2029 has a wat morphology agn , very unusual ( unique to our knowledge ) for a cool - core cluster . finally",
    ", the lack of nebular emission lines in the cd galaxies are characteristic of non - cool - core clusters @xcite .    of these three clusters",
    "only a644 possesses a central temperature peak .",
    "although a644 appears to be unique in that its temperature profile declines toward the center and then rises , there are a few reports of clusters in the literature with temperature profiles measured by either  or  that peak at their centers . the clusters a2218 @xcite and a3921 @xcite are violent , advanced mergers with with pronounced asymmetrical surface brightness and temperature distributions uncharacteristic of a644 , a2029 , and a2589 .",
    "another cluster with a reported central temperature peak is a401 @xcite , which is in the early stages of a major merger ( with a399 ) .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite argue that the properties of a401 are determined primarily from its own hierarchical formation before interaction with a399 . in this context",
    "it is interesting that a401 has a weak radio halo since we have suggested that radio halos form only in massive clusters where a violent merger has proceeded fully into the cluster core @xcite .",
    "if the other clusters had a similar history , their lack of radio halos indicate they are presently at much more evolved states than a401 .    in the paradigm wherein the energy output from an agn disrupts cooling flows",
    ", it is expected that just prior to the onset of agn feedback a cluster will have the characteristics of a cool - core cluster but without significant radio emission or x - ray cavities .",
    "indeed , the clusters a644 , a2029 , and a2589 are excellent candidates for this pre - feedback state , with a644 being at a relatively early state and a2029 at the very latest evolutionary state , where an agn outburst has already occurred but little or no heating from agn - generated cosmic rays has commenced .",
    "the extremely advanced evolutionary states of a2029 and a2589 make them ideal for studies of their core mass profiles using the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
