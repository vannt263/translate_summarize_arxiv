    "the six - vertex model is one of the few exactly solved models in statistical mechanics .",
    "its origin lies in the problem of counting the number of configurations of the hydrogen atoms in hydrogen - bonded crystals , such as ice@xmath0 and kh@xmath1po@xmath2.@xmath3 in 1967 , lieb , yang , and sutherland@xmath4 obtained exact solutions for various versions of the model , and the most general solution was described by sutherland , yang , and yang.@xmath5 these publications contain virtually no details , and later more explicit accounts were published by lieb and wu,@xmath6 and nolden.@xmath7 the paper by nolden contains a detailed description of the exact solution , and explicit results for some special cases where these can be obtained analytically .",
    "however , the low - temperature ferroelectric regime is not treated there .",
    "a more recent application of the six - vertex model is as a model of crystal surfaces .",
    "various restricted solid - on - solid models can be mapped onto the six - vertex model , as was shown by van beijeren for the body - centered - cubic lattice,@xmath8 and by jayaprakash and saam for the face - centered - cubic lattice.@xmath9 this last mapping in particular focuses attention on the low - temperature ferroelectric regime of the six - vertex model . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was conjectured that there would be a discontinuity of slope at a particular point in the crystal shape .",
    "since in this mapping the crystal shape is , up to a scaling factor , given by the shape of the free energy surface as a function of applied fields,@xmath10 this implies the presence of a singularity in the free energy at this point .",
    "however , such a singularity was not mentioned in the general solution of the six - vertex model.@xmath5 our re - examination of the exact solution in this regime , following the method presented in ref.@xcite shows that there is indeed a singularity at this point , and that it has new and unusual properties . in this point ,",
    "a one - parameter family of polarizations coexists , and near it interesting scaling properties are found .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ model ] , we give a short , general discussion of the six - vertex model , and briefly review the expressions from the exact solution that we use further on .",
    "then , in section [ deltalarger ] , we apply those expressions to a particular point in the phase diagram in the low - temperature regime , where a completely analytical solution is possible .",
    "the behavior of the free energy and the order parameters at and around this point is discussed . in section [ delta1 ] the same is done , in less detail , at the transition between the low- and high - temperature regimes .",
    "conclusions and a summary of the results are given in section [ concl ] .",
    "the appendices contain calculational details that were omitted from the main text of the paper .",
    "a brief account of this work was published in ref .",
    "a configuration of the six - vertex model is given by a covering of the bonds of a square lattice with arrows , satisfying the ice rule : every lattice point must have two incoming and two outgoing arrows .",
    "there are six possible vertices that satisfy this rule ( see fig .  [ vertices ] ) . to make the model amenable to a solution by transfer matrix techniques it is necessary to impose periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of down arrows is equal in each row of bonds ; this conservation law is essential for the exact solution of the model .",
    "the transfer matrix method used in the exact solution is discussed in , _",

    "the partition function of the model is simply given by the sum over all allowed configurations of the boltzmann factors of the configurations .",
    "the usual way to write the energies of the vertices is given in fig .",
    "[ vertices ] .",
    "the quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 are to be thought of as fields , acting on the horizontal and vertical arrows respectively , favoring one orientation over the other .",
    "( the name `` asymmetric six - vertex model '' refers to the fact that these fields create an asymmetry between left and right and between up and down arrows . )",
    "the fact that vertices 5 and 6 have the same energy is no restriction : since they are sinks and sources of horizontal arrows they have to occur in pairs because of the periodic boundary conditions , so only the sum of their energies is relevant .",
    "the variables that are conjugate to the fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the polarizations @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these are defined as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath17 is the fraction of the horizontal arrows pointing to the left . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are order parameters for the various ordered phases .",
    "the free energy per vertex can be viewed as either a function of the fields , @xmath18 , or of the polarizations , @xmath19 .",
    "the two are related by a two - dimensional legendre transformation @xmath20 which implies @xmath21 , with the fields given by @xmath22 or conversely @xmath23 the free energy that is calculated in the exact solution is actually @xmath24 , because of the conservation law for the number of down arrows .",
    "this amounts to solving the model for fixed values of @xmath11 and @xmath14 .",
    "the relevant free energies @xmath19 and @xmath18 are then obtained from @xmath24 through one - dimensional legendre transformations .    most of the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite is valid for any values of the vertex energies .",

    "the expression for @xmath13 is just the same as the one found previously for @xmath14 , @xmath140 with the same functions @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",

    "we have calculated @xmath13 and @xmath12 to zeroth order in @xmath62 the rigorous way , obtaining the same results as above .",
    "second , from the symmetry properties we can also derive consistency relations for the expressions for @xmath14 in various regions . for example , we can repeat the above reasoning for @xmath152 .",

    "we have dealt with this problem by using an integration routine with adaptive stepsize control ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , chap .  4 ) , as opposed to the simple gaussian quadrature used for solving the integral equations and determining the less  sensitive integrals .",

    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 change continuously , so @xmath18 is smoothly curved . along the pt lines the curved part of @xmath193 joins smoothly onto the linear part , since the singularity in @xmath18 corresponding to the ( second order ) pt transition leaves the first derivative continuous . along the first order transition line there _ is _ a jump in slope , so that a ridge is formed . at the two conical points the slope of @xmath193 depends on the way in which the point is approached , as will be shown later on .",
    "we now turn to the phase diagram in @xmath13-@xmath14 space , fig .",
    "[ fexy ] . here",
    "the four frozen phases correspond to the corner points @xmath194 .",
    "the incompletely polarized phases take up the rest of the phase diagram outside the lines @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the two conical points now correspond to the two lines @xmath195 and @xmath196 , which are given by @xmath197 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively ( see eq .",
    "( [ coef1 ] ) ) . by eliminating @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ coef1 ] ) we find that the lines @xmath198 are given by @xmath199}{1\\pm x_0\\tanh[(\\phi_0-\\nu)/2]}\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ fexyeq ] ) we see that on , _ e.g. _ , @xmath195 , where @xmath56 and @xmath88 , the free energy is @xmath200 .",
    "this means that the slope of @xmath19 , which is equal to @xmath201 , is the same everywhere along @xmath195 , and that every @xmath202 on @xmath195 corresponds to the same point in @xmath203 , the conical point .",
    "so , all the polarizations @xmath202 are stable in the conical point .",
    "this is similar to the coexistence of a one - parameter family of magnetizations @xmath204 with @xmath205 in a zero - field xy model for @xmath206 .",
    "however , there the coexistence is due to an obvious symmetry in the hamiltonian , while in the six - vertex model the symmetry that allows the polarizations to coexist is not an obvious symmetry in the hamiltonian and therefore appears to be generated spontaneously .",
    "it can be shown that different values of @xmath46 correspond to entering the conical point with different angles from the incompletely polarized region ; if @xmath46 is kept fixed as @xmath207 , the conical point is approached from an angle @xmath208 \\label{angle}\\ ] ] with respect to the line @xmath185 .",
    "since every different @xmath46 leads to a different value of @xmath181 , and @xmath181 gives the slope of @xmath18 , the slope in the conical point depends on the angle at which it is entered .",
    "this gives @xmath18 a geometry similar to the tip of a cone at this point , hence the name `` conical '' point .",
    "the exact solution does not give any states with polarizations in the regions @xmath209 between @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "thus , no pure equilibrium states with those polarizations exist , and strictly speaking the free energy @xmath19 is not defined in this region .",
    "however , a state with an _ average _ polarization @xmath181 in , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath210 can be formed as a mixture of states on @xmath195 , properly weighted to give the right average polarization .",
    "this leads to a free energy that is also an average of the free energies of the states in the mixture , which means that it is linear in @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in this way , the regions @xmath209 are interpreted as describing mixtures of the coexisting phases on @xmath198 , similar to states that are a mixture of coexisting gas and liquid phases at a gas - liquid phase transition .",
    "the slope of the free energy surface @xmath19 is then given by @xmath211 in @xmath212 , and @xmath213 in @xmath214 .",
    "this matches the slopes on the lines @xmath195 and @xmath196 , so that the first derivative of the free energy @xmath19 is continuous across these lines .",
    "its higher derivatives are not continuous , however , and the free energy has singularities at the lines @xmath198 , since an analytic function can not be matched to a purely linear function in a regular way .",
    "this form of the free energy also means that the fields corresponding to the regions @xmath209 are the same as those for the lines @xmath198 , _",
    "i.e. _ the mixtures described by @xmath209 occur in the conical points .",
    "the two linear parts of @xmath19 meet along the line @xmath215 , forming a groove .",
    "this groove corresponds to the coexistence of the two frozen phases along the first order transition in fig .",
    "[ fehv ] , and it was already mentioned in ref .",
    "however , it is stated there that the groove is the only set of points in @xmath216 where @xmath19 is non - analytic , while in fact there are additional non - analyticities along the lines @xmath198 .    to examine the nature of the singularities in the free energy we now specialize to the case @xmath217 , so that we are on the lines @xmath218 and @xmath219 , moving from the incompletely polarized phase towards the conical point as @xmath220 .",
    "the behavior along this line should be qualitatively the same as along any other line emanating from the conical point ; however , it is much easier to deal with just two variables instead of four . solving for @xmath62 in @xmath221 , and substituting this in the expression for @xmath14 ( eq . [ coef1 ] ) , we find that @xmath222 so , as @xmath223 goes to zero , @xmath14 approaches its value of @xmath107 in the conical point with a slope that diverges like @xmath224 .",
    "this value is in agreement with recent work@xmath225 which shows that certain ( 1 + 1)dimensional surface growth models map onto the conical point in the @xmath203 phase diagram , and that kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz)@xmath226 scaling holds . in particular , the exponent of @xmath227 in eq .",
    "( [ joel1 ] ) is given by @xmath228,@xmath229 where @xmath230 is the dynamic exponent for the kpz universality class .",
    "relation ( [ joel1 ] ) can be integrated to give @xmath231 , since @xmath232 ( the factor 2 comes from the fact that @xmath233 and @xmath185 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath234 the first few terms of this expression reproduce the expansion of @xmath231 given in terms of @xmath62 earlier ( eq . [ fehveq ] ) .",
    "similarly , an expression for @xmath235 can be derived by writing @xmath12 in terms of @xmath236 and integrating the relation @xmath237 .",
    "it is @xmath238 again , this confirms the expansion given earlier ( eq . [ fexyeq ] ) .",
    "the appearance of the terms @xmath239 and @xmath240 means that both @xmath19 and @xmath18 have non - analyticities at the first - order transition , in addition to the expected discontinuities in their derivatives .",
    "thus , the traditional mean - field picture of a first - order phase transition as two branches of the free energy simply crossing is not valid .",
    "as the transition is approached from the incompletely polarized phase , the free energy becomes singular , and there is no obvious way to extend this branch of the free energy into the regions @xmath241 in fig .",
    "[ fexy ] to find metastable states .",
    "it is thought that the existence of non - analyticities at coexistence boundaries is a generic feature;@xmath242 the two - dimensional ising model , _",
    "e.g. _ , shows a weak essential singularity in @xmath243 at @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "vector spin models ( where , as here , a whole continuous family of order parameter values coexists at a single point ) show power law singularities similar to the ones found here , albeit with different values for the exponents ( we are not aware of any previous observation of , _ e.g. _ , a `` susceptibility '' @xmath246 with an exponent of @xmath247 ) . as a further comparison we mention that at the pt transition , where @xmath14 goes to 1 , the free energies behave like@xmath9 @xmath248    note that the conical points are reached either by letting @xmath249 or by letting @xmath250 ( or some combination of both ) , as was remarked earlier . taking @xmath251 brings us into the point along some nonzero angle with respect to the pt line in @xmath203 space , whereas @xmath250 takes us in tangent to the pt line .",
    "the scaling properties derived above [ eqs .",
    "( [ joel1][joel3 ] ) ] correspond to the former case . in the special case of a trajectory tangent to the pt line",
    ", the scaling would be determined by the limit @xmath250 .",
    "in particular , we know that the free energy @xmath18 is analytic in @xmath11 and @xmath12 along the pt line itself ( @xmath252 with @xmath55 ) . by coming into the conical point along other curves which are tangent to the pt line , intermediate scaling forms of various kinds could be obtained , but such scaling behavior is not generic and therefore somewhat contrived .",
    "this brings us to a closely  related point which is : in which region is the behavior near the conical point dominated by the proximity to the conical point , and in which region is it dominated by the proximity to the pt lines ?",
    "for example , we might ask how to determine the region over which we can observe the scaling ( _ e.g. _ the pokrovsky  talapov behavior ) associated with the boundary of the completely polarized region .",
    "the preceding discussion suggests that this region is very narrow .",
    "indeed , by considering when the second term in the denominator of ( a19 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite is of order 1 , we find that a curve of the form @xmath253 separates the two regions . here",
    ", @xmath254 is the distance in the @xmath11@xmath12 plane to the conical point and @xmath255 is the perpendicular distance to the pt line . note that this curve is tangent to the pt line , deviating only quadratically as one moves away from the conical point .",
    "application of ( a19 ) in ref.@xcite also tells us that the coefficients of the @xmath256 and @xmath257 terms of the expansion of the free energy about the completely polarized region [ as in eq .",
    "( [ ptscaling ] ) ] are unchanged by the presence of the conical point , and thus that the coefficient of the pt scaling term is not modified . however , higher  order terms in the expansion diverge as one approaches the conical point , representing the fact the the pt scaling will be observable over an ever  smaller angular region near the pt line .",
    "we can also examine the temperature dependence of various quantities .",
    "for example , the jump in @xmath14 along @xmath185 in the conical point , @xmath258 behaves as follows : for @xmath259 , _",
    "@xmath260 , we find that @xmath261 , so that @xmath262 . for @xmath263 , _ i.e. _ @xmath264 , we find @xmath265 , and @xmath266 , so that @xmath267 .",
    "qualitatively the same temperature dependences are found for the opening angle @xmath268 between the two boundaries of the incompletely polarized phase at the conical point ; @xmath269 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ angle ] ) by letting @xmath252 , which gives @xmath270 .",
    "finally , we might ask whether there are any analytic approximations we can make which are valid over the entire phase diagram .",
    "indeed , we can perform an expansion of eqs .",
    "( [ req][yheq ] ) to lowest nontrivial order in the temperature.@xmath271 to do this , we ignore terms in @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 , and @xmath275 which are down by factors of order @xmath276 ( or higher powers ) from the dominant terms . since to this order the kernel @xmath273 is identically 1 , the integral equation can then be solved analytically and we can write down explicit expressions for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 in terms of @xmath45 and @xmath46 . the expressions for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , however , involve an integral which apparently must be evaluated numerically . furthermore , even the expressions for @xmath13 and @xmath14 can not be inverted to eliminate the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the equations entirely ( leaving us , as we had hoped , with direct relations between @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore , these expressions , while providing us with a simpler numerical task than solving integral equations , do not lead to any profound simplification .    since we have ignored terms down by orders of @xmath276 , the low ",
    "temperature approximation is quite accurate even up to a large fraction of the critical temperature .",
    "one particularly interesting fact about the accuracy of this approximation should be noted : although the general features , such as the locations of the pt lines ( corresponding to @xmath277 ) are not obtained exactly , everything involving the conical points ( _ i.e. , _ the limit @xmath249 and the limit @xmath278 ) _ is _ exactly correct .",
    "this includes the location of these points in the @xmath203 plane , the expressions for @xmath279 , and even the expansions for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 about the conical point [ eqs.([coefexp][coef1 ] ) ] to the orders we know them .",
    "( in particular , this means that the transition temperature @xmath280 is obtained exactly  a curious fact for the first term of a low  temperature expansion ! ) we hypothesize that the fact that the behavior at the conical points is obtained exactly could be evidence that this behavior is controlled by a zero  temperature fixed point .",
    "the case @xmath281 corresponds to the critical point @xmath41 , where the first - order line in fig .",
    "[ fehv ] has shrunk to zero length ( see fig .  [ somethign ] ) , and the two conical points at the end of this line have now coalesced into one point , which will disappear for @xmath282 . here",
    ", it is possible to obtain some analytic results for @xmath283 , which corresponds to this limiting point .",
    "it turns out to be much harder to make an expansion about @xmath284 than about @xmath56 , and we were only able to obtain a limited amount of information about this case .",
    "we can go through the same steps as in section  [ deltalarger ] , using the relevant expressions from table  [ ftable ] .",
    "now equation ( [ req ] ) can be solved by means of a fourier transform , defined as @xmath285 the fourier transform of @xmath68 is again the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the one for @xmath69 can easily be calculated : @xmath286 solving ( [ req ] ) for @xmath287 gives @xmath288 as usual , @xmath289 is not determined .",
    "however , that does not prevent us from fourier transforming back to find @xmath73 , @xmath290    it is , to a certain extent , possible to expand @xmath47 in @xmath291 around @xmath284 .",
    "it can be shown that the leading corrections are of the form @xmath292 with @xmath293 and @xmath294 real functions , @xmath293 even and @xmath294 odd .",
    "these two functions are determined by two integral equations which still contain @xmath45 . even though numerical evidence shows that @xmath293 and @xmath294 have well - defined limits for @xmath295",
    ", there is no obvious way to take this limit in the integral equations , and we have not been able to obtain closed - form expressions for the two functions .    to get @xmath107 and @xmath108 we again apply ( [ yheq ] ) .",
    "it turns out that we have to be slightly careful in taking the limit @xmath295 , because we have to consider the possibility that @xmath46 diverges along with @xmath45 , so we can not just set @xmath284 as we did before . from table",
    "[ ftable ] it is apparent that @xmath296 no matter how @xmath45 and @xmath46 go to infinity . for the integral term",
    "we find @xmath297 with the upper ( lower ) signs for @xmath298 ( @xmath299 ) .",
    "so we find that for @xmath295 @xmath300 and @xmath301 in both cases .",
    "so by letting @xmath46 go to infinity along with @xmath45 , any positive value of @xmath107 can be selected .",
    "it follows from the expansion ( [ d1exp ] ) that the corrections to both @xmath11 and @xmath14 will be of order @xmath291 ; however , the coefficients of these terms can not be calculated without knowledge of the functions @xmath293 and @xmath294 .    to find expressions for @xmath13 and @xmath12 we can again use the symmetries discussed in section [ symms ] , if every occurrence of @xmath302 is replaced by @xmath303 .",
    "in particular , we immediately find that @xmath304 .",
    "it is also possible to find the free energy in the limit that @xmath295 .",
    "as before , it turns out that for @xmath299 and @xmath305 the right eigenvalue is largest , and for @xmath306 the left eigenvalue is largest . in all cases",
    "we find that @xmath307 , independent of @xmath46 .",
    "this confirms the above conclusion that @xmath308 .",
    "we can again examine the scaling behavior of the free energies .",
    "as in the case @xmath309 , @xmath24 is a regular power series in the expansion variable , @xmath291 .",
    "however , in contrast to that case , the expansions for @xmath14 and @xmath11 both contain linear terms in the expansion variable .",
    "this implies that the polarizations are non - singular functions of the fields .",
    "doing the legendre transform of @xmath24 to obtain @xmath19 , we find that the coexistence regions @xmath209 have shrunk to the line @xmath215 , and the behavior around this line is now quadratic in @xmath310 .",
    "so both the groove at @xmath215 and the singularities at the lines @xmath198 ( which are now collapsed to @xmath215 ) have disappeared .",
    "the free energy can thus be written @xmath311 where the coefficient @xmath312 is a function of the position along @xmath215 .",
    "similarly , the free energy as a function of the fields is given by @xmath313 where @xmath107 depends on the ratio @xmath314 according to eq .",
    "( [ d1y0 ] ) , _ i.e. _ , it depends on the details of how the point @xmath35 is approached . note that both the jump in the slope of @xmath18 on entering this point , and the singularities on approaching it , have disappeared ; however , the slope in the @xmath315 direction ( given by @xmath316 ) still depends on the way in which this point is approached .",
    "this reflects the fact that , as @xmath317 from above , the two pt boundaries approach each other , and the curvature of @xmath18 in the @xmath315 direction goes to infinity .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the phase diagram of the asymmetric , ferroelectric six - vertex model in the low - temperature phase . from numerical results",
    "we get a global picture of the behavior of the free energy as a function of the polarizations and fields , @xmath19 and @xmath18 , and by analytical methods we found several new and interesting features . for @xmath245 ( @xmath33 ) , in addition to the groove that was already known to exist in the free energy surface @xmath19 , there are additional singularities along the lines @xmath198 , corresponding to two conical points in @xmath18 . in these points , which lie at the ends of a ridge in @xmath18 , all polarizations on @xmath198 are stable for one value of the fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "also associated with these points are the two coexistence regions @xmath209 , where mixtures of the coexisting states are stable .    as @xmath263 ( @xmath264 ) ,",
    "the size of the regions @xmath209 decreases , as does the length of the ridge in @xmath18 . at @xmath41 ,",
    "the two conical points merge as the ridge is reduced to a point , and the regions @xmath209 vanish .",
    "there is still a family of polarizations , @xmath215 , that is stable in the ( one ) conical point . if there are any non - analyticities left in the free energy they are of higher order than the terms we have been able to study . above @xmath280",
    ", the conical point disappears completely .",
    "the behavior of the free energies when approaching the conical points is rather unexpected .",
    "both the fact that there _ are _ power law divergences , while the phase transition is discontinuous and thus first - order , and the specific exponents of the power laws , are interesting",
    ". it would be useful to find metastable states in the regions @xmath209 with a uniform polarization , and examine how such a state decays into a mixture of stable states on the lines @xmath198 .",
    "however , because of the singularities in @xmath193 there is no obvious way to analytically continue the free energy into the unstable region , in order to find such metastable states in a straightforward manner .",
    "also , there does not seem to be any mechanism to select one of the many possible mixtures that such a state might break up into .",
    "thus one can ask how the process of phase separation , or spinodal decomposition , would actually take place .    a particular system in which this issue needs to be addressed is the phase separation of crystal surfaces.@xmath318 through the mapping of the six - vertex model onto restricted solid - on - solid models@xmath319 the polarizations @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "are found to be equivalent to surface orientations , and the free energy @xmath18 turns out to be a replica of the crystal shape itself,@xmath320 while @xmath19 is the surface tension .",
    "thus , the conical points represent actual points on the crystal surface that have a conical geometry . , the free energy as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 has a conical point ( _ i.e. _  there is a cusp in the surface tension ) ; this leads to a flat region in the crystal shape @xmath18 : a facet.@xmath7 this situation is thus the converse of what takes place for @xmath309 . ] in these points , various surface orientations all coexist .",
    "also , there is a discontinuity in orientation as one crosses a conical point , since the orientations that correspond to states in the regions @xmath209 are not stable anywhere .",
    "furthermore , if a crystal is cleaved to form a surface having one of these unstable orientations ( say in @xmath210 ) , it should decompose into a mixture of stable orientations selected from the set @xmath321 , which then coarsens over time .",
    "this is the phase separation process mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "these issues are discussed in more detail in ref .",
