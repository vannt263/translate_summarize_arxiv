    "out of over 250 exoplanets known to date , over 20 are known to transit their stars .",
    "transiting planets are important because we can derive the precise mass and radius , and can begin to determine other planetary properties , such as the bulk composition .",
    "much attention has been given to `` ocean planets '' or `` water worlds '' , planets composed mostly of solid water @xcite .",
    "if a water world is found close to a star , it would be strong evidence for migration because insufficient volatiles exist near the star for _ in situ _ formation .",
    "the proposed identification of water worlds is through transits . from a measured mass and radius a low - density water planet",
    "could potentially be identified .",
    "we examine the possibility that water worlds can not be uniquely identified based on the mass and radius of a transiting planet .",
    "an alternative interpretation could be a rocky planet with a thick hydrogen - rich atmosphere .",
    "most authors have assumed that solid planets in the 5 to 10 @xmath0 range have an insignificant amount of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "exoplanets have , however , contradicted our basic assumptions before .",
    "notable examples include : the existence of hot jupiters ; the predominance of giant planets in eccentric orbits ; and the gas - rock hybrid planet hd  149026b with its @xmath1 core and @xmath2 h / he envelope @xcite .",
    "we adopt the idea that a wide range of atmospheric formation and loss mechanisms exist and can lead to a range of atmosphere masses on different exoplanets .",
    "we explore the mass - radius relationship for the lowest - mass exoplanets yet detected ( @xmath3  5 - 20 @xmath0 ) in order to identify potential ambiguities that result from the presence of a massive atmosphere .",
    "we explore atmospheres ranging from @xmath4 ( 10 @xmath5 venus atmospheric mass ) to @xmath6 ( the estimated mass of uranus and neptune s h / he @xcite ) , with a focus on the smaller mass range .",
    "we also explore potential compositions for the transiting neptune - size planet gj  436b @xcite .",
    "our model assumes a spherical planet in hydrostatic equilibrium , with concentric shells of different composition sorted by density .",
    "we solve for the mass @xmath7 , pressure @xmath8 , density @xmath9 , and temperature @xmath10 using the equation for mass of a spherical shell , @xmath11 the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath12 and the equation of state of the material .",
    "@xmath13    to build a model planet , the composition and mass of up to three layers are specified .",
    "starting from a central pressure adjusted to achieve the desired mass , the differential equations for @xmath8 and @xmath7 are numerically integrated outward , and @xmath14 is calculated from the equation of state for the material . at the boundary between layers , @xmath8 and @xmath7",
    "are used as the initial conditions for the next layer .",
    "the integration is stopped at the outer boundary condition @xmath15  bar , approximately where the atmosphere ceases to be opaque at visible and infrared wavelengths .",
    "the temperature of a planet s gas layer has a significant effect on the radius . instead of computing a cooling history to obtain @xmath10 , we calculate @xmath10 , separately in three different regimes . within the solid portion of the planet ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "temperature has little effect on the final radius , and is assumed to be isothermal ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the deep hydrogen - helium layer where the pressure is greater than 1 kbar ( @xmath17 )",
    ", we assume that convection dominates and the temperature follows an adiabat tied to the entropy , @xmath18 , at 1 kbar . at lower pressures ( @xmath19 )",
    ", we use the radiative equilibrium gray analytical model of @xcite and @xcite for irradiated atmospheres , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the optical depth , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angle of incident radiation with respect to the surface normal , and @xmath24 is a parameter that accounts for the altitude at which radiation is absorbed . we convert from optical depth to pressure through a constant scaling relation under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and constant opacity per gram , following @xcite but taking into account the planet s surface gravity . here",
    "@xmath25 is the effective temperature in the absence of stellar irradiation , representing energy from internal sources .",
    "@xmath26 is the equilibrium temperature which represents heating from the parent star .",
    "we emphasize that by choosing an effective temperature  or adiabat  we are subsuming a cooling calculation .",
    "this is common practice for modeling the interior structure of solar system giant planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and was also the case even before their @xmath25s and gravitational moments were known or well known @xcite .",
    "in fact , even with a known @xmath25 cooling calculations only match observed parameters for jupiter ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; saturn is hotter than expected @xcite and uranus and neptune are colder than expected @xcite .",
    "an additional motivation to adopt a simple framework for temperature is the huge uncertainty in interior parameters for rocky planets .",
    "this includes the temperature - dependent equation of state of liquids and solids at high temperature and pressure , the temperature - dependent viscosity , and the effect of tides on the cooling history for eccentric exoplanets .",
    "we further note that our choice of radiative equilibrium down to 1 kbar is based on the irradiated atmosphere / interior models by @xcite . for our fiducial model",
    "we choose @xmath25 to be similar to earth s and uranus s . while the largest uncertainty in our treatment is the qualitative choice of @xmath25 ,",
    "we subsequently vary over a reasonable range of effective temperatures ( or adiabats ) .",
    "we use the h / he equation of state from @xcite , ignoring the `` plasma - phase transition '' which may be a numerical artifact ( d. saumon 2007 , private communication ) . the equations of state for the solid materials fe @xcite , mgsio@xmath27 perovskite @xcite , ( mg , fe)sio@xmath27 @xcite , and h@xmath28o are described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "our fiducial planet consists of a 30% fe core and a 70% mgsio@xmath27 mantle , roughly analogous to earth .",
    "we used a h / he mixture with helium mass fraction @xmath29 ( the he mass fraction of the solar nebula ) .",
    "we chose @xmath30  k , based on the observation that a planet around an m - dwarf at an orbital distance of 0.1 au has a similar equilibrium temperature to earth ( assuming similar albedos ) .",
    "we set @xmath31  k , similar to earth and uranus   w @xcite and uranus has @xmath32  w of energy flow @xcite . ] . for the atmospheric parameters ,",
    "we fixed @xmath33 and @xmath34 to represent radiation absorbed deep in the atmosphere would correspond to absorption high in the atmosphere . ] .",
    "we later investigate variations on @xmath35 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath24 .",
    "figure  1 shows a plot of the mass - radius relationship for fiducial planets of masses 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 @xmath0 . for each planet mass",
    ", we added atmospheres ranging in mass from 0.001 - 1 @xmath0 .",
    "for example , an h / he atmosphere of @xmath36 by mass  only ten times greater than venus atmospheric mass fraction  is required for a noticeable radius increase . as seen in figure  1 , adding a hydrogen - helium atmosphere with just 0.1% of the mass of a 10 @xmath0 rocky planet results in a 5% increase in the planetary radius  within a measurement precision that has been obtained for currently known transiting planets .    as a second example , adding a gas layer of h / he equal to 1% of the mass of our fiducial planets increases the radius by @xmath3 20% of the original planet radius , or by about 0.35 @xmath37 for the planet masses we considered .",
    "our major finding is that that exoplanets with a significant h / he layer can not be distinguished from water worlds , based on @xmath38 and @xmath39 alone . for our fiducial solid exoplanets , adding up to 5% h / he by mass ( for 10 @xmath0 planets ) is sufficient to push the planet s radius through the entire range of radii corresponding to solid planets with no gas , including planets with up to 100 percent water composition . while we have not completed an exhaustive study of possible compositions , we find the non - uniqueness of water planets to be valid for any conditions we investigated .",
    "this generic finding holds for a wide range of assumptions of assumed temperatures . taking our fiducial model , we vary @xmath26 , @xmath25 , and @xmath24 individually . for a 10 @xmath0 solid planet with an additional 0.1 @xmath0 h / he atmosphere , increasing @xmath26 from 300 to 500 k increases the radius by about  1% ( figure  2 ) . for",
    "the same planet varying @xmath25 from 10  k to 50  k results in an 8% increase in radius . while large , this value is comparable to expected radius uncertanties for these planets @xcite .",
    "varying the altitude where radiation is absorbed ( specified by @xmath24 ) has a much smaller effect on the planet radius .",
    "varying @xmath24 from 0.1 to 10 causes the radius to decrease by 0.2% .",
    "a corollary of our main result is that when a planet has a significant h / he atmosphere there is a wide degeneracy in allowable internal composition .",
    "this is not just compositional , but also relates to the trade off of temperature and mass of h / he gas .",
    "it could be argued that specifying a planet s composition implies a particular internal thermal profile derived from a consistent cooling history . as addressed in  2 , the many unknowns and free input parameters for rocky planet interiors  such as the possible differences between atmospheric and interior compositions , equation of states , and the effect of tides on the planet s cooling history ",
    "prevent a self - consistent solution for the present time .    how could a 520 @xmath0 exoplanet get a substantial h / he layer",
    "? two different scenarios may produce them : direct capture of gas from the protoplanetary disk ( possibly modified by the escape of some fraction of the original gas ) or outgassing during accretion .    a planet may capture and retain up to 1 to 2 @xmath0 of h / he if the planetary core did not grow quickly enough to capture more before the gas in the disk evaporated ( as is the paradigm for uranus and neptune ) .",
    "alternatively , for short - period exoplanets , a 1 to 2  @xmath0 h / he envelope may result after substantial loss of an initially massive gas envelope from irradiated evaporation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite consider atmospheric evaporation during migration , and conclude that the @xmath40 innermost planet in hd  69830 , at 0.08 au , kept @xmath32 @xmath0 of h / he over the 4 gyr lifetime of the star .",
    "little attention has been given to the mass and composition of exoplanet atmospheres from outgassing .",
    "venus atmosphere is @xmath41 ; if venus had a surface gravity high enough to prevent h escape , its atmosphere would be over @xmath42 .",
    "even more massive h - rich atmospheres are possible . if a massive iron - silicate planet formed with enough water , the iron may react with the water during differentiation , liberating hydrogen gas @xcite .",
    "l. elkins - tanton et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "estimate that the maximum h component is about six percent by mass for a terrestrial - composition planet . for a @xmath40 planet",
    "this would result in a @xmath43 h envelope .",
    "for short - period , low - mass planets , theoretical arguments of atmospheric escape may be the best way to identify a water world based on the mass and radius measurements alone @xcite .",
    "indeed , our assumption of h / he atmospheres for exoplanets relies on the condition that atmospheric mass loss has not evaporated all of the h / he . in the absence of hydrodynamic",
    "escape , the exospheric temperature ( and not the atmospheric @xmath25 ) drives the thermal jeans escape of light gases .",
    "earth and jupiter both have exobase temperatures of 1000  k @xcite , significantly above their @xmath25 of 255  k and 124.4  k respectively @xcite .",
    "uranus and neptune have exobase temperatures around 750  k @xcite .",
    "we note that because gj 436 must have at least 1  @xmath0 of h / he , its exospheric temperature is not too high . on the other extreme",
    ", planets of @xmath44 would require very low exospheric temperatures ( @xmath45  k ) to retain a massive atmosphere over the course of billions of years .",
    "nevertheless , a young @xmath44 earth - mass planet with a captured atmosphere could still have a h / he atmosphere and an old @xmath44 planet could retain a substantial he fraction , making its compositional identification ambiguous .",
    "we now turn to a qualitative study of gj436b , to show that the interpretation that gj436b is a water world akin to uranus and neptune @xcite is not the only possibility .",
    "we consider the gj  436b values @xmath46 and @xmath47 from @xcite .",
    "the internal structure in figure  3 shows how three planets with very different internal compositions can have the same total mass and radius .",
    "we first explore a planet similar to our fiducial model : a 22.2 @xmath0 solid planet with earth - like iron / rock mass ratio ( 30/70 ) , @xmath31  k , and @xmath48  k in rough agreement with the orbital parameters ( assuming an albedo of 0.1 ) . by adding @xmath33.2@xmath0 of hydrogen - helium to the 19.0 @xmath0 solid planet",
    ", we are able to reproduce gj  436b s radius .",
    "we note that the mass of gas is 15% of the solid mass , likely too much to have originated from outgassing , and so capture must be at least partially invoked to explain such a massive atmosphere .",
    "the second composition for gj  436b we considered is for water worlds , one with a 50% water mantle ( by mass ) and 50% silicate core , and another with 90% water mantle and a 10% silicate core .",
    "these planets also need some h / he to match the known radius , 12% and 8% by mass , respectively .",
    "the third model approximates planets with atmospheres created from outgassing , considering an extreme scenario where all of the available water has oxidized iron , leaving a 100% ( mg , fe)sio@xmath27 solid planet core . to match the observed radius , a 22.2 @xmath0 planet requires @xmath49 of h alone , a case that assumes no initial trapping and subsequent outgassing of he .",
    "the pure - hydrogen atmosphere is 10% of the mass of the solid planet .",
    "this is above the theoretical maximum of outgassing based on observed abundances of metallic iron in chondritic meteorites from our solar system ( see elkins - tanton et al . in prep ) .",
    "although not an exhaustive study , the range of interior compositions illustrates the variety of possibilities , though all models require some h / he .",
    "while our study is preliminary , we make the robust point that h - rich thick atmospheres will confuse the interpretation of planets based on a measured mass and radius .",
    "this point is independent of the uncertainties retained by our model including @xmath26 , @xmath25 , the mass fraction of h / he , and the mixing ratio of h and he .",
    "we find that the identification of water worlds based on the mass - radius relationship alone is impossible unless a significant gas layer can be ruled out by other means .",
    "spectroscopy is the most likely means and may become routine with transit transmission and emission spectroscopy , and eventually with spectroscopy by direct imaging .                                                              , b. , fischer , d.  a. , henry , g.  w. , laughlin , g. , butler , r.  p. , marcy , g.  w. , vogt , s.  s. , bodenheimer , p. , ida , s. , toyota , e. , wolf , a. , valenti , j.  a. , boyd , l.  j. , johnson , j.  a. , wright , j.  t. , ammons , m. , robinson , s. , strader , j. , mccarthy , c. , tah , k.  l. , & minniti , d. 2005 , , 633 , 465          , f. , chazelas , b. , borde , p. , ollivier , m. , brachet , f. , decaudin , m. , bouchy , f. , ehrenreich , d. , griessmeier , j.  . ,",
