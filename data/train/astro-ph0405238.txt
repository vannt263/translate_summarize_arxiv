    "the _ einstein _ observatory detected a small number of x - ray sources ( xrss ) with luminosities near @xmath11 erg s@xmath1 , and little or no emission above @xmath12 kev .",
    "rosat _ identified approximately a dozen such sources in the magellanic clouds and galaxy and more than @xmath13 in m31 , the empirical class of luminous supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) was established .",
    "ssss of lower luminosity ( but greater than roughly @xmath14 erg s@xmath1 ) have also been discovered .",
    "the effective radii of ssss are comparable to white dwarf ( wd ) radii , although in principle , sss - like radiation can be emitted by objects more compact than wds .",
    "indeed , roughly half of the ssss with optical ids contain hot wds ",
    ", recent novae , symbiotics , a planetary nebula . the other ssss are binaries which are thought to contain wds accreting at high enough rates ( @xmath15 yr@xmath1 ) to allow nuclear burning ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "because absorption can readily hide emission from ssss , we can study large populations of them only by observing external galaxies located along directions with small gas columns .",
    "unfortunately , however , their great distance from us ensures that we receive few photons from most xrss in external galaxies .",
    "it is therefore important to develop methods for identifying ssss on the basis of broadband fluxes rather than detailed x - ray spectra .",
    "we have developed an algorithm based on @xmath16 energy bands to select ssss from among all of the xrss in an external galaxy . for details of the algorithm and tests on simulated data ,",
    "see  & kong ( 2003b ) ; the flow chart of figure  1 sketches its broad outlines .",
    "the first @xmath4 steps in the algorithm select the softest sources , those most likely to be like the ssss observed in the galaxy and magellanic clouds .",
    "we refer to the sources selected by these two steps as  classical \" supersoft sources , or simply ssss .",
    "an additional @xmath17 steps relax the selection criteria in a hierarchical fashion , to avoid missing potentially important sets of very soft sources . for example , when we observe a hot ( @xmath18 ev ) sss located behind a large gas column , the relative fraction of counts recieved above @xmath19 kev might be so large that restrictive criteria would fail to identify the source as an sss , even though the unabsorbed spectrum would fit the sss criteria .",
    "in fact , such a hot sss would be particularly interesting , because it could be among the hottest of nuclear - burning wds and a good candidate for a possible future type ia supernova .",
    "less restrictive conditions also allow us to identify as very soft , those ssss producing so few counts that their hardness ratios are not well constrained .",
    "in fact , since low - luminosity ssss are expected to be more numerous than those with high luminosities , and since absorption can decrease the count rate significantly , many genuine ssss we observe in other galaxies will fall in this category .",
    "we therefore need to loosen the selection criteria in a systematic way that does not rely on only hardness ratios .",
    "less restrictive conditions , however , have the potential to cast a wider net , selecting sources that are actually harder than the locally - studied ssss . in this paper , we concentrate on the characteristics of those sources identified by the additonal @xmath17 steps in our algorithm .",
    "because they can be hotter than the known ssss , we have dubbed them `` quasisoft '' sources ( qsss ) .",
    "thus , qsss are an operationally - defined set of sources whose distinguishing characteristics may be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) their broadband spectra should have no significant emission above @xmath4 kev , with @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of counts between @xmath4 and @xmath17 kev , and @xmath22 is the one@xmath23 uncertaintly , including both the effects of counting statistics and ambient background ; or ( 2 ) if @xmath24 there is a strict limit on the ratio @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total number of photons , combined with requirements on the relative significance of the detections in the @xmath27 and @xmath21 bands . for example , one of three such requirements in our algorithm is : @xmath28 combined with @xmath29      we have used the algorithm to conduct studies of qsss and ssss in a small number of external galaxies . when we have had enough counts for spectral fits , the best - fit models for qsss have tended to be significantly harder than models expected for ssss .",
    "for example , in m31 we find @xmath13 ssss and @xmath30 qsss , with @xmath31 of all xrss falling into one of these @xmath4 categories (  et al .",
    "four of the vsss are bright enough to permit spectral fits using photons from a single image .",
    "one of these is a qss and is clearly harder than the other @xmath16 , which are ssss ( figure 2 of  et al .",
    "each of the @xmath16 ssss can be fit by a blackbody model ; the temperatures are 25 ev , 56 ev , and 122 ev .",
    "the qss is the only one of the four with a significant number of photons evident out to @xmath4 kev ; it is fit by a combination of a blackbody model ( @xmath32 ev ) and a power law model , ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the central @xmath34 of m31 contains the largest fraction of vsss ( @xmath35 of all xrss ) , most of them are ssss ( @xmath36 ssss out of @xmath37 vsss ) . in contrast",
    ", the majority of m31 vsss in the outer disk are qsss .    in a study of very soft sources in m101 , m83 , m51 , and ngc 4697",
    ", we found @xmath38 ssss and @xmath39 qsss ( distefano & kong 2003c ) .",
    "spectral fits could be carried out for @xmath40 individual ssss ; @xmath17 of these were well - fit by blackbody models with @xmath8 ev @xmath41 ev , with a median value of @xmath42 ev .",
    "spectral fits could be carried out for @xmath36 individual qsss ; @xmath17 of these were well - fit by blackbody models with @xmath43 ev @xmath44 ev , all but one with @xmath45 ev , and with a median value of @xmath46 ev .    in m104 ( ngc 4594 ) , the sombrero galaxy , we found among @xmath7 xrss in total , @xmath47 vsss ,",
    "only @xmath48 of which are ssss (  et al .",
    ". the dominance of qsss relative to ssss in m104 , which is viewed edge - on , could be due to two effects .",
    "first , absorption in the disk is so severe that we are primarily sensitive to vsss located more than @xmath49 pc above the disk , more likely to be part of an older stellar population .",
    "second , absorption is more likely to obscure or alter the observed spectra of ssss .",
    "one of m104 s qsss , x-35 , appears to be associated with a globular cluster ( gc ) .",
    "no source with both comparable luminosity and spectral properties has been discovered in the gc system of either the galaxy or m31 . in ngc 4472 , we found 211 x - ray sources ; 5 are ssss and 22 are qsss .",
    "we also found @xmath50 gcs associated with vsss , @xmath4 ssss and @xmath51 qsss (  et al .",
    "2003c ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the properties of qsss in as much detail as possible , especially to elucidate spectral differences between qsss and both ssss and canonical xrss .",
    "we begin in  2 with a study of the broadband spectral properties qsss , ssss , and canonical xrss in six galaxies whose vss populations we have already identified through previous archival studies .",
    "the galaxies are m101 and m83 , two spirals viewed almost face - on ; m51 , an interacting galaxy ; m104 , a spiral seen almost edge on , and two elipticals , ngc 4472 , and ngc 4697 .",
    "these galaxies were chosen for the work described in  2 because we have the most detailed information about their broadband spectra .",
    "in addition , we used a deeper _ chandra _   observation of m51 ( obsid1622 ) in this paper .",
    "as part of our earlier studies , we have determined the count rates in each of @xmath40 energy bins : @xmath52 kev , @xmath53 kev , @xmath54 kev , @xmath55 kev , @xmath56 kev , @xmath57 kev , @xmath58 kev , and @xmath59 kev .    because we aim to extend the study of qsss to a larger number of galaxies , spanning a greater variety of galaxy environments , in  3 we discuss the analysis of archival data from a total of @xmath5 galaxies , including m31 and the @xmath50 galaxies discussed in  2 .",
    "in addition to ngc 4472 and ngc 4697 , we now consider @xmath17 other elliptical galaxies , and an s0 galaxy .",
    "we add to the @xmath51 spirals of  2 , @xmath48 additional spirals observed at a variety of orientations , and located at a broader range of distances . to each galaxy , even those studied before ,",
    "we apply one single procedure to detect xrss and to select vsss .",
    "we identify @xmath5 qsss that can be subjected to spectral fits .",
    "since some qsss may be absorbed ssss , this last step is important to test whether a significant subset are genuinely harder .",
    "we consider a variety of physical models for qsss in  4 .",
    "we turn in  5 to discussions of the size of qss populations in galaxies . in this regard",
    "it is especially important to consider our own galaxy . since our algorithm would identify few ( if any ) qsss in the milky way , we focus on the question of how to identify qsss in the milky way .",
    "we present our conclusions , and consider the prospects for future research in  6 .",
    "here we sketch the procedures for source detection and the selection of vsss detailed in the papers on these specific galaxies : m101 , m83 , m51 , and ngc 4697 (  & kong 2003 ) ; m104 (  et al .",
    "2003b ) ; and ngc 4472 ( friedman et al .",
    "2003 ;  et al .",
    "source detection was accomplished using wavedetect , with the energy range @xmath60 kev ; each source was visually inspected and any spurious sources were eliminated .",
    "we analyzed only data taken with the s3 ccd .",
    "( the exception was ngc 4472 , for which we analyzed the data from all of the ccds . )",
    "_ chandra _ deep field studies were used to estimate the expected numbers of background sources , @xmath61 per s3 field , given the typical exposure times ; this is much smaller than the numbers of sources detected .",
    "we eliminated all xrss associated with known foreground stars , which can have spectra and timing properties similar to vsss .",
    "in addition , we tested for the expected foreground and background vsss by running our detection algorithm on data from several extragalactic fields analyzed by the _ champ _ team .",
    "we found that , given typical exposure times , the s3 fields would typically contain @xmath62 vsss . because this number is small compared to the numbers of vsss actually detected , it is likely that the majority of vsss are actually associated with the galaxies themselves .",
    "further evidence that most xrss ( including vsss ) are associated with the galaxies comes from the fact that the majority are clearly associated with galaxy features , such as spiral arms , or exhibit density variations that appear related to the distance from the galaxy centers .",
    "table 1 summarizes the results on the relative sizes of the sss , qss , and canonical xrs populations in each of m101 , m83 , m51 , m104 , ngc 4697 , and ngc 4472 .",
    "( we did not include m31 because only a small portion of the galaxy has been observed with s3 , and the results differ from field to field , as described in  1.1 . )",
    "the total number of sources detected is @xmath63 of which @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) are vsss . of the vsss ,",
    "@xmath6 sources were identified as ssss .",
    "direct comparisons of the numbers of each type of source from galaxy to galaxy can be misleading , since the detection limits are different , and conditions within the galaxies , such as the gas distribution , strongly influence sss detection and have not been studied .",
    "nevertheless , two features do stand out .",
    "first , each galaxy has a significant population of vsss , including qsss .",
    "while ssss were expected , there is not a large pool of local sources ( in the galaxy or magellanic clouds ) known to have the spectral properties of qsss and luminosities in the range observed for these extragalactic sources , typically above @xmath11 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "second , the ratio of the number of qsss to ssss appears to be larger for the two ellipticals and for m104 .",
    "since both ellipticals are along directions with low-@xmath66 and because absorption by gas along the line of sight within these galaxies is less likely , it seems probable that the qsss they contain are not simply absorbed ssss , but sources with intrinsically harder spectra .",
    "furthermore , because the stellar populations of the ellipticals are likely to be old , table 1 may indicate that qsss are more common , compared with ssss , among older populations .",
    "this would be consistent with the relative dominance of qsss over ssss in ( 1 ) m104 , and in ( 2 ) regions of m31 near the outer portions of the disk , where little or no recent star formation has taken place .    figure 2 shows the percentage of the photons from all ssss ( bottom panel ) , qsss ( middle panel ) , and canonical xrss ( top panel ) with energies in each of the @xmath40 energy bins : @xmath52 kev , @xmath53 kev , @xmath54 kev , @xmath55 kev , @xmath56 kev , @xmath57 kev , @xmath58 kev , and @xmath59 kev .",
    "this figure confirms the selection procedure is working .",
    "ssss , for example , have little or no emission above @xmath67 kev .",
    "qsss are significantly harder than any of the ssss detected in the galaxy and magellanic clouds , in that a significant fraction ( @xmath68 ) of the radiation they emit is in the form of photons with energies above @xmath19 kev .",
    "these sources will not be chosen by procedures designed to select ssss .",
    "yet , they are significantly softer than canonical xrss , since photons with energies above @xmath4 kev are either absent from their spectra or constitute only a small fraction ( @xmath69 ) of the total emission .",
    "thus , the sources we have dubbed qsss , based on the properties of their broadband spectra , seem to span the spectrum between ssss and canonical xrss .",
    "an interesting feature is that only roughly @xmath70 of the photons from so - called canonical xrss have energies above @xmath4 kev ( see also  2003 ) .    [",

    "as is the case for ssss , the empirical definition of qsss is broad , allowing the class to possibly encompass a wide range of physical phenomena . for ssss ,",
    "the key clue was provided by the effective radius and the fact that hot wds , whether the central stars of planetary nebulae , post - novae , or quasi - steady nuclear burners , were expected to have temperatures as hot as those observed for ssss .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that more than half of the local systems appear to be wd systems of known types .",

    "indeed , two ssss in m31 appear to be associated with snrs ( distefano et al .",
    "nevertheless , the large majority of ssss for which we have multiple observations are highly variable or even transient , ruling out snr models .",
    "some ssss are ultraluminous , most likely ruling out wd models and suggesting the possibility that they are accreting intermediate - mass bhs ( imbhs ) .",
    "the effective radii are also compatible with imbh models ( see below ) .",
    "just as the sss moniker can likely corrspond to several different physical models , so can the label  qss \" . as for ssss , we use the effective radius to obtain a clue as to the nature of the sources .",
    "@xmath82 this is smaller than the radii of wd , but larger than the radii of nss .",
    "it is roughly @xmath83 times larger than the scharzschild radius of a @xmath84 bh , or roughly @xmath40 times larger than the inner disk radius , if there is ongoing accretion extending inward to the last stable orbit .",
    "judging simply by the effective radius , the most natural model would therefore be one in which the accretor is a bh with mass larger than expected for the remnants of present - day stars .",
    "( in  4.2 we show that this conclusion is supported even for the standard disk models used for bh accretors . )",
    "models other than those invoking an imbh are nevertheless possible , and we therefore begin by considering them in  4.1 , before focusing on imbh models in  4.2 .      _",
    "white dwarfs : _ for qsss , @xmath85 is less than half the radius of the smallest wd ( one with @xmath86 ) .",
    "in fact , if we assume that the surface of a @xmath87 wd is radiating at the eddington luminosity , we find that the maximum possible temperature is @xmath88 ev . calculations of emission from hot wds which are either experiencing or have recently experienced nuclear burning find , however , that the photosphere is located well above the surface , and temperatures tend to be below @xmath49 ev ( nomoto 1982 ; iben 1982 ) .",
    "thus , while it may be possible for qss - behavior to be exhibited by a wd , this would require that the emission emanate from a limited portion of the wd surface , or else that there be a significant amount of reprocessing of the soft radiation emitted from the photosphere .",
    "behavior like this has not been observed in those local ssss either known or suspected to be hot wds .",
    "we note , however , that some qsss from which we have recieved only a small number of photons are classified as qsss rather than ssss on the basis of just a few photons with energies above @xmath19 kev .",
    "deeper observations of such sources might reveal them to be ssss , or might find that the energy in photons above @xmath19 kev is small enough to be consistent with modest upscattering of photons from a hot wd , or with shocking due to winds , etc . only roughly @xmath89 of ,",
    "e.g. , the vsss of table 1 provide fewer than @xmath90 counts , however , so such an explanation is unlikely to apply to the majority of qsss . in summary , although they can not be ruled out , wd models are not the preferred models for most qsss .",
    "_ neutron stars : _ @xmath85 is larger than ns radii .",
    "nevertheless , when ssss with even larger effective radii were discovered , it was noted that , on theoretical grounds , nss can have extended photospheres ( kylafis & xilouris 1994 ) .",
    "this model was not the subject of much additional attention as an explanation of ssss , possibly because there seemed to be no obvious mechanism to preferentially select wd - like radii .",
    "if , however , some qsss are nss , their discovery may signal that a continuum of effective radii is realized in nature , eliminating the fine - tuning problem .",
    "in fact , at least one ns systems with soft sss - like emission and beamed hard emission is known .",
    "the x - ray pulsar rx  j  0059.2 - 7138 ( hughes 1994 ) has a luminous soft unpulsed component ( see also kohno , yokogawa , and koyama 2000 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that rx  j  0059.2 - 7138 is an anomaly .",
    "in fact , her x-1 , a galactic x - ray pulsar , has long been known to have a luminous time - variable soft component ( shulman et al .. 1975 ; fritz  1976 ) .",
    "if this is common , then a set of soft sources in external galaxies may simply be x - ray pulsars for which we are out of the beam of the harder emission .",
    "rx  j  0059.2 - 7138 would likely be identified as a sss ; it is conceivable , however , that other x - ray pulsars have luminous soft components with spectra like qsss instead of ssss .",
    "another conjecture is that some qsss and ssss represent temporal states of ns in which the hard emission is off , but the soft emission continues .",
    "such states could occur fairly frequently among local x - ray binaries , and , since the _",
    "rxte s all - sky monitor ( asm ) _ can not detect the soft emission ( @xmath91 kev ) that would be dominant , we would only be aware of them if they happened to occur during specific observations with detectors having good soft sensitivity . in summary ,",
    "some qsss could be ns binaries from which we have not detected hard radiation because of either the angle from which we view the system or the temporal state of the system . in either case , the ability to detect and study qsss in other galaxies would have implications for population estimates and evolutionary calculations ; in addition , we should be able to identify a sizable population of local analogues ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "_ stellar - mass black holes : _ analogous arguments for temporal states can be applied to stellar mass bhs . in fact ,",
    "locally - studied stellar mass bhs do exhibit  thermal dominant \" ( td ) , or  soft \" states .",
    "these states are , however , much harder than qss spectra , with typical values of @xmath2 for the td states of stellar - mass bhs larger than 600 ev .",
    "for a recent detailed review , see mcclintock & remillard ( 2004 ) . during intervals when the inner disk temperature appears to be lower , i.e. , the inner disk radius is larger , the radiation is not dominated by thermal emission from a disk , but rather by a a harder power - law component ( see , e.g. , sobczak et al .",
    "even though stellar - mass bh spectra are harder than qsss , they appear to be the the closest analogues among physical states that are actually known to exist in our galaxy",

    "2004 and references therein ) , to identify bhs in other galaxies .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the square of the temperature of the inner disk is inveresly proportional to the mass of the central bh .",
    "larger mass bhs should exhibit softer spectra . if , therefore , there is not a sharp truncation in the bh mass function , td states with softer spectra are expected , and may provide an explantion for qsss .",
    "_ snrs : _ the lmc contains several snrs ( n63a , dem 71 , n132d , and n49 ) with luminosities between @xmath92 erg s@xmath1 and @xmath93 erg s@xmath1 have @xmath94 kev @xmath95 kev ( hughes , hayashi , & koyama 1998 ) .",
    "thus , although they are cool compared with other bright snrs , they are hotter than qsss . furthermore , on theoretical grounds , is expected that the snr should dim as is it cools .",
    "note however , that we do find apparent counterexamples in the x - ray data from m31 .",
    "near the center of m31 , there are three x - ray snrs ( identified by both x - rays and radio ) that have temperatures of @xmath96 ev ( kong et al .",

    "we have also found that roughly half of the bright qsss in m51 are variable .",
    "as summarized above , each standard model , wd , ns , stellar - mass bh accretors , or snrs , can potentially produce emission with the range of temperatures and luminosities exhibited by the qsss we have observed in other galaxies .",
    "no one model , however , appears to be an especially natural candidate to explain the majority of qsss .",
    "it is possible that the relatively soft spectra of qsss , as compared with stellar - mass bhs , indicates that qsss are associated with bhs of somewhat higher mass . indeed , if we assume that @xmath85 should correspond to the radius of the last stable orbit around a schwarzschild bh , at @xmath16 times the schwarzschild radius , then @xmath97 for the blackbody fit parameters in table 1 , the bh masses computed from this formula range from approximately @xmath9 up to nearly @xmath98 , with @xmath50 ( @xmath16 ) masses greater than @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , and a median value of @xmath101 . for a thin but optically thick disk ,",
    "the appropriate formula is identical to eq . 2 , but with a factor included on the right - hand side to take into account the effects of spin , spectral hardening , and orientation .",
    "for schwarzscild bhs , the factor is typically @xmath102 leading to larger mass estimates , as high as @xmath103 . for spinning black holes",
    ", the spectral hardening parameter tends to be smaller , but there is an overall factor of @xmath16 , producing generally higher mass estimates .",
    "furthermore , the true luminosities may be significantly larger than the estimated x - ray luminosities .",
    "in summary , qss spectra are consistent with the imbh hypothesis .",
    "in fact qss spectra can be viewed as extensions of the td states of stellar - mass bhs to softer disks and , therefore to possibly larger masses .",
    "furthermore , some of the qsss may represent extensions of ulx spectra to lower luminosities .",
    "evidence for cool disks comes from fits to several ulx spectra ( see . ,",
    "e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2003 , kong &  2003 ; , zampieri et al .",
    "most recently , wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have used monte carlo simulations to conduct a self - consistent study of the disk and a comptonized power law component and found an inner disk temperature @xmath104 ev for @xmath50 of seven ulxs .",
    "even the most luminous qsss considered in  2 provided far fewer photons than the ulxs studied by wang et al .",
    "thus , since the power - law component is typically more than an order of magnitude dimmer than the thermal component ( see also mc clintock and remillard 2003 ) , it is conceivable that the sources we find to be predominantly soft do have a harder component which provides too few photons to significantly influence the fit .    because @xmath105 [ k\\ , t/(200\\ , ev)]^4 $ ] , the x - ray luminosities of these qsss tend to be @xmath106 of the eddington value , which can be compatible with optically thick thermal emission .",
    "we note further , that the x - ray flux would be only a small portion of the energy output by the bh .",
    "for example , only the region just around the inner edge of the disk is hot enough to emit x - rays . until recently",
    ", it was thought that soft states in bhs were predominantly also  high , \" luminous states .",
    "observations of several systems have , however , suggested that such states occur over a range of luminosities , including relatively low ( but not quiescent ) states .",

    "if any of the ulxs now considered as possible imbhs in other galaxies ( e.g. miller & colbert 2003 ) , actually are imbhs , qsss fit in as a natural part of the class .",

    "second , the qsss that are not ulxs may represent the lower @xmath108 systems that should constitute the _ bulk _ of the imbh population .",
    "indeed , if any of the ulxs currently under study do harbor imbhs , it is clear that there must be a less luminous population of imbhs , since , in the context of most binary models , the least luminous imbhs are expected to be the most numerous representatives of the class .",
    "it has been convincingly demonstrated that the total energy output in some ulxs is indeed large , consistent with the high estimated x - ray luminosities ( pakull & mirioni 2002 ) .",
    "spectral studies of a small but growing number of systems suggest signs of cool disks expected for accreting imbhs ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2003 ; kong 2003 ; cropper et al .",
    "2004 ; miller et al .",
    "if some ulxs are imbhs , then it is certain that at least some galaxies are home to large numbers of less luminous imbhs .",
    "the dominant spectral component for those imbhs accreting at rates not too much below the eddington luminosity is expected to be soft .",
    "it therefore seems possible that the spectral selection procedure we have employed can identify , from among the many xrss in a galaxy , those most likely to be imbhs .",
    "the accretion rates ( @xmath109 for the systems in table 1 range from roughly @xmath110 yr@xmath1 to @xmath111 yr@xmath1 , consistent with binary models (  2004 ) .",
    "with the limited information we have so far , it is not possible to compute the size of typical galactic populations of qsss .",
    "because we do not yet know what they are , we can not be guided by theoretical models .",
    "furthermore , the data collected so far provide only limited information .",
    "the detection limits vary significantly among the galaxies we have studied , ranging from @xmath112 erg s@xmath1 for long ( @xmath113 ksec ) observations of m31 to just under @xmath114 erg s@xmath1 for @xmath115 ksec observations of galaxies at @xmath116 mpc .",
    "( to compute these limits , we assume that 14 - 20 counts are required to both detect a source and classify it as qss , and that @xmath117 @xmath118 ; we use pimms ao6 release to estimate count rates . )",
    "we find sources down to the detection limits of the galaxies we have studied in detail : m31 , m83 , m51 , m104 , ngc 4697 , and ngc 4472 . because of its proximity , m31 may provide the best guide . in _",
    "observations which are effectively sensitive to qsss in only roughly @xmath119 of the area of m31 , e.g. , we have identified @xmath30 qsss .",
    "we can therefore argue for at least several dozen qsss in m31 .",
    "if other galaxies harbor qsss , so must our own .",
    "in fact it is almost certain that some detected xrss would be identified as qsss were they located in other galaxies , such as m101 .",
    "there are , however , few , if any obvious local candidates for the class .",
    "it is not surprising that we have apparently not yet identified a pool of luminous sources with the spectral properties of qsss in our galaxy or in the mcs .",
    "first , absorption in the galactic plane modifies the spectra of soft sources significantly .",
    "second , as described below , the surveys best poised to study galactic sources would have had some difficulties in studying qsss .",
    "for example , a @xmath120 erg s@xmath1 source @xmath48 kpc from us would yield a flux of @xmath121 erg s@xmath1 @xmath118 . if @xmath122 ev , the count rate for _ rosat _ s pspc would have been roughly @xmath12 count s@xmath1 , and the source would have been easily detected in the _ all sky survey _ ( _ rass _ ) .",
    "more than @xmath123 of the incident photons would have energies above @xmath12 kev , however ; with the pspc s sensitivity cut off of @xmath124 kev , there would have been no way to determine that there is little flux at higher energies .",
    "thus , while the difference between ssss and canonical xrss was readily detected by _ rosat _",
    ", the difference between qsss and canonical xrss was not .    in recent years",
    ", the most extensive and detailed information collected on local x - ray binaries has been collected by _",
    "rxte_. its sensitivity , however , does not extend below @xmath4 kev .",
    "_ rxte _ can therefore not detect ssss , or even those qsss which emit no radiation in the @xmath21 band .",
    "it is very likely , however , that the high - energy tails of some qsss have been detected by _",
    "rxte_. the measured flux would typically be on the order of a percent of the bolometric flux .",
    "this suggests that qsss may be selected by comparing the _ rass _ source list with lists from other catalogs of galactic x - ray binaries ( e.g. liu , van paradijs , & van den heuvel 2001 ) and carrying out spectral fits for _ rass _ sources that ( 1 ) exhibit high count rates , but ( 2 ) have low flux above @xmath4 kev , as measured from fits in other catalogs ( e.g. liu , van paradijs , & van den heuvel 2001 ) , and which ( 3 ) are not identified with foreground stars or background galaxies .",
    "we note that imbh models for some qsss are attractive because , in them , qsss represent a natural extension of known systems .",
    "first , the class of qsss can be viewed as a possible soft extension of the td states of well - studied stellar - mass bhs .",
    "second , qsss , and possibly some ssss , with luminosities below @xmath107 erg s@xmath1 can be viewed as possible extensions to lower luminosity of some ulx candidates for imbhs . indeed ,",
    "since systems accreting close to the eddington limit are rare , qsss of the type studied in this paper may form the dominant population of accreting imbhs .",
    "existing _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ data should also contain qsss in deep exposures taken toward the galaxy s center ( muno et al .",
    "2003 ) , and in data taken during pointed observations and archived as part of _ champ _",
    "( see green et al .",
    "2003 ) or _ champlane _ cf .",
    "grindlay et al .",
    "a broadband selection procedure can be developed to select qsss from among the other xrss in these data sets . in order to be effective",
    ", it would require a larger number of energy bins above @xmath19 kev than we have used so far .",
    "a combination of broadband selection and spectral fits should then be able to identify qsss .",
    "if the density in and near the galactic plane is roughly @xmath12 per cubic kpc , we might expect to find roughly a dozen within a few kpc of earth .",
    "identifying these systems would be important , because we can collect from them enough x - ray photons for good spectral fits .",
    "perhaps even more important , we can hope to obtain optical ids for some nearby systems , detemining the natures of the donor stars , measuring orbital parameters , studying disk properties at other wavebands , etc . in this way we may be able to determine the physical natures of some qsss .",
    "even one well - studied system will be significant ; but it will be particularly important to develop a sample of qsss , as it seems unlikely that all of them can be described by a single physical model .",
    "when we attempted to identify ssss in other galaxies , we found that each galaxy harbors , in addition to ssss , a large population of somewhat harder sources .",
    "qsss and ssss are found in elliptical and spiral galaxies , near galaxy centers , in and near the arms of spiral galaxies , in galaxy halos (  & kong 2003d ) , and in globular clusters (  et al .",
    "2003b ;  et al .",
    "2004 ) . whether there is a smooth continuum between the softest and hardest sources , or",
    "whether there are preferred ranges within the continuum remains to be seen .",
    "qsss are xrss whose spectra fill the gap between ssss and luminous canonical x - ray sources .",
    "the challenge raised by their discovery is to understand what physical states they represent . with the same sort of broad definition used for ssss ,",
    "the class of qsss is likely to include a variety of physical systems .",
    "whatever the nature or natures of the sources , however , it seems clear that qss behavior is introducing us to new regions of the parameter space .",
    "if , e.g. , some qsss are hot wds , then we must understand ( 1 ) why the emitting regions are small , or ( 2 ) how a large portion of the soft radiation is upscattered , or ( 3 ) if there is a warm plasma or other emitting region associated with the system .",
    "in what way are wd qsss different from the local wd systems ?    if , on the other hand , qsss are nss , there are other sets of issues to be explored .",
    "what determines the range of photospheric radii ?",
    "are some of the soft sources x - ray pulsars , for which we are out of the path of the beamed emission ? can physical principles be used to predict the relative numbers of ns systems emitting soft or hard radiation ?    finally , any qsss that are accreting bhs raise different questions .",
    "can we use the discovery of qsss to identify bhs in distant galaxies ?",
    "what fracion are imbhs ? are the qsss we have discovered in the gcs of m104 and ngc 4472 bhs with masses above that of typical stellar - mass bhs ?",
    "if so , do they represent the bhs predicted to exist at the center of some star clusters ?    in summary ,",
    "the discovery of qsss should inspire theoretical work on possible hard states of hot wds , and possible soft states of luminous snrs , ns accretors , and bh accretors across a range of masses .",
    "although we have argued that imbh models are promising , it is likely that several models are realized in nature .",
    "the key point is that the generation of radiation in the qss regime points to new sets of active states .",
    "longer observations of the galaxies in our study will provide more detailed and reliable fits for the brightest sources and allow fits to be carried out for some of the dimmer qsss .",
    "additional observations will also provide checks for time variability , which can help distinguish between x - ray binaries and snrs and to determine the applicability of stellar - mass bh models .",
    "searches for qsss in our own galaxy are nearly certain to yield individual systems close enough to be subject to detailed study across wavebands , perhaps elucidating the natures of the sources .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank jeffrey e. mcclintock , jon m. miller , andrea h. prestwich , frederick d. seward , and patrick slane for conversations .",
