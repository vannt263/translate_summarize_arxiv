    "relaxation of the re magnetic moments provides important information about fluctuating electric and magnetic fields in cuprate superconductors . in the normal state , re ions with non - zero orbital moment can interact with phonons , spin fluctuations and charge carriers .",

    "inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) is widely used to study the relaxation of the re magnetic moments in cuprates superconductors by measuring the linewidths of the observed cf transitions.@xcite however , the mechanism of the relaxation of re ions in cuprates is the issue of hot debates.@xcite most of the authors consider an interaction of 4@xmath12 spins with charge carrier spins ( korringa mechanism ) as a dominant channel of relaxation.@xcite other authors , in opposite , conclude that the interactions of re spins with charge carriers are negligible and that the interactions with lattice vibrations are only responsible for the relaxation behavior of the 4@xmath12 spins in cuprates.@xcite at the moment there is no consensus on this subject and therefore it is important to disentangle the electronic and phononic sources of relaxation .",
    "relaxation of the 4@xmath12 magnetic moments can be studied also by measuring the linewidth of the electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) signal of the re ions.@xcite there have been a few epr studies of the re ions with non - zero orbital moment ( er and yb ) doped in cuprates.@xcite again , the situation with epr is similarly contradictory as in ins studies .",
    "some groups observed both electronic ( korringa ) and phononic ( orbach ) contributions to epr relaxation.@xcite while others conclude that the korringa contribution is negligible and the interaction with lattice vibrations only is sufficient to explain the temperature dependence of the epr linewidth in cuprates.@xcite    in this work we report a detailed epr study of the yb@xmath0 relaxation in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 samples with oxygen content @xmath7 covering the whole doping range ( @xmath4 ) . by measuring the temperature dependence of the yb@xmath0 epr linewidth in a broad temperature range",

    "the observed line shape can be interpreted in the following way : a temperature - independent residual function due to inhomogeneous broadening which is further broadened by a temperature dependent relaxation .",
    "the method by which the relaxation - induced peak - to - peak derivative linewidth @xmath42 is extracted from the total peak - to - peak linewidth of the epr signal @xmath43 depends upon the line shapes associated with inhomogeneous and homogeneous broadening mechanisms .",

    "the anisotropic nature of the yb@xmath0 signal , the partially resolved hyperfine structure , and the non - ideal grain alignment , make it very difficult to accurately model the complex shape of the yb epr spectra and its evolution with temperature .",

    "an integral is replaced by a sum of 120 lorentzians : @xmath56 the residual function @xmath57 , characterizing the inhomogeneous line shape was obtained at low temperatures where relaxational broadening is negligible .",
    "we found that in all samples measured in the present work , except one zn - doped sample , the relaxational broadening was absent below 40 k. therefore , this temperature was used to determine the inhomogeneous line shape for samples without zn doping . in zn - doped sample",

    "3 that in this sample , which is antiferromagnetic and insulating with practically no charge carriers , the relaxation rate is comparable to those of samples with much higher oxygen contents .",

    "such a comparison is shown in table ii .",
    "the excellent quantitative agreement of the relaxation rates obtained by two different experimental techniques is remarkable and provides strong support of the methods of extracting relaxation rates from mssbauer spectroscopy@xcite and from epr spectra presented in this work .",
    "ccc + @xmath30(k ) & @xmath98(10@xmath93 s@xmath99 ) & @xmath100(10@xmath93 s@xmath99 ) + 60 & 0.5(1 ) & 0.6(1 ) + 70 & 1.3(1 ) & 1.2(1 ) + 80 & 2.5(1 ) & 1.8(1 ) + 90 & 4.0(1 ) & 4.4(1 ) +    relaxation measurements at low temperatures ( @xmath101 ) can provide information about the superconducting gap symmetry.@xcite however , in the present epr experiments we could not detect relaxation broadening at @xmath101 , since it becomes much smaller than the inhomogeneous residual linewidth .",
    "this prevents a reliable measurement of the relaxation rate below @xmath102 .",
    "it is expected that at low temperatures in the superconducting state the yb@xmath0 relaxation rate will decrease below 10@xmath103 s@xmath99 . in this case @xmath104 can be measured directly using the pulse epr techniques .",
    "it would be interesting to perform such experiments at low temperatures .",
    "to summarize , we performed a detailed study of the temperature dependence of the yb@xmath0 epr linewidth , i.e. , the relaxation in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 from the undoped insulating to the optimally doped superconducting region ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "it was found that both electronic and phononic processes contribute to yb@xmath0 relaxation .",
    "we were able to separate these processes and studied their relative contributions to relaxation as a function of oxygen doping .",
    "as expected , the electronic contribution decreases with decreasing oxygen doping , while the phonon contribution is practically doping independent .",
    "it was found that the phononic part of relaxation has an exponential temperature dependence , which can not be explained by a traditional mechanism involving acoustic phonons . instead , a raman process via the coupling to high - energy ( @xmath5500 k ) optical phonons or an orbach - like process via the excited vibronic levels of the cu@xmath6 ions ( localized slonczewski - modes ) is responsible for the phononic part of the yb@xmath0 relaxation in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath38 .    in a sample with maximum oxygen doping @xmath82 ,",
    "the electronic part of relaxation follows the korringa law in the normal state , and a sharp drop of the relaxation rate was observed below @xmath8 .",
    "comparison of the epr linewidths in samples with and without zn doping allowed us to prove that the superconducting gap opening is responsible for the sharp decrease of yb@xmath0 relaxation in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath9 .",
    "it was shown that the electronic part of the yb@xmath0 relaxation rate in the superconducting state follows a very similar temperature dependence as the @xmath10cu and the @xmath11o nuclear relaxation rates , despite the huge difference between the corresponding electronic and nuclear relaxation rates .",
    "there is an excellent quantitative agreement between relaxation rates of yb@xmath0 in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath27 obtained previously by mssbauer spectroscopy and in the present work by epr .",
    "this provides strong support of the methods of extracting relaxation rates from mssbauer spectroscopy and from epr spectra .",
    "one should note however , that the epr signal from yb@xmath0 in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 can be followed up to at least 160 k , while mssbauer measurements in the same compound using @xmath97yb are limited by 90 k due to the decrease in the intensity of the mssbauer effect with temperature .",
    "the present results demonstrate that yb@xmath0 can serve as a very effective microscopic spin probe to study electronic , magnetic and lattice properties of yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
