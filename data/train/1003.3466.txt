    "we then limit the abundance of ucmhs from constraints on dark matter annihilation , and thus the abundance of pbhs themselves .",

    "annihilation into quarks , charged leptons , or gauge bosons produces a gamma - ray continuum when those particles decay .",
    "electron - positron final states produce gamma rays , through internal bremsstrahlung , with branching fraction @xmath15 .",
    "this process is an electromagnetic radiative correction ; it is independent of surrounding matter density , occurs in any process involving charged particles , and produces gamma rays with energies up to @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "it might be thought that neutrinos are invisible annihilation products ; in fact , there are stringent bounds on them @xcite .",

    "other standard model annihilation products are intermediate to the above cases .",
    "according to @xcite and @xcite , a ucmh ( with or without a pbh ) at @xmath16 with dark matter mass @xmath17 has a truncation radius @xmath18 ucmhs with pbhs at matter - radiation equality have @xmath19 .",

    "this density profile is shallower than in @xcite , which assumed @xmath27 throughout , and that adiabatic contraction increased the dark matter density further .",

    "wimps also have residual thermal dispersion , @xmath44 ; conservatively , we find radial accretion at @xmath28 holds for @xmath45 .",
    "accretion at later times than @xmath46 , at smaller radius than @xmath28 , or from the low end of the wimp velocity distribution might still form a ucmh ; so our limits may roughly hold for smaller pbhs .",
    "finally , wimps must miss the central pbh .",
    "wimps with an apocenter @xmath34 have a pericenter @xmath47 ; if the apocenter is @xmath28 , then @xmath48 thus , wimps with apocenters of @xmath28 remain outside the schwarzschild radius if @xmath49 .",
    "the ucmh annihilation luminosity is @xmath50 , or @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a minimum - radius cutoff .",
    "even if wimps with small apocenters annihilate away by the present , wimps on radial infall orbits with larger apocenters generate a time - averaged density profile of @xmath25 between apocenter and pericenter . and with identical tangential speeds .",
    "the time - averaged mass at each radius is proportional to the time they spend there : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the radial velocity . for nearly radial orbits , @xmath55 , except near pericenter and apocenter .",
    "thus @xmath56 ; since @xmath57 , @xmath58 except near pericenter and apocenter . ]",
    "therefore , we use @xmath59 as @xmath52 .",
    "the ucmh luminosity is @xmath60 ignoring a very small logarithmic term in @xmath61 .",
    "the linear scaling with @xmath61 arises because the ucmh mass scales linearly with pbh mass , and the wimp density ( and annihilation lifetime ) at @xmath28 is always the same .",
    "when @xmath25 , each decade in minihalo radius produces the same annihilation luminosity ; the total luminosity therefore is not strongly dependent on the wimp orbits eccentricities .",
    "the eccentricities themselves depend weakly on @xmath61 , since @xmath62 .",
    "thus the total luminosity is understood as the mass of the ucmh halo ( proportional to @xmath61 ) annihilating over a _ fixed _",
    "annihilation timescale ( set by @xmath63 ) multiplied by some slowly varying logarithmic factor accounting for the ucmh s inner regions .    a steeper density profile inside @xmath28 would increase the luminosity but shorten the wimp survival time .",

    "efficient annihilation introduces @xmath71 worth of high energy radiation into the universe . at high redshift ,",
    "the cmb energy spectrum and reionization history severely constrain the gamma - ray and cosmic ray injection rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at low enough redshift",
    ", the gamma - ray and neutrino backgrounds still constrain the annihilation products directly .",
    "thus , it would be difficult to have @xmath72 , unless perhaps the annihilation were entirely into neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , such efficient annihilation would mean that present ucmhs around pbhs have depleted inner halos , with consequences for microlensing searches @xcite .",
    "more work on the effects of annihilation in steep density profiles is needed .",
    "this annihilation luminosity depends on some simple considerations .",
    "we assume that pbhs have not evaporated yet , which is valid for @xmath73 ; and that most of the dark matter is made of wimps and not pbhs , otherwise there would be too few wimps to form a ucmh .",
    "we require that the density profile along a wimp s orbit not evolve significantly .",
    "most importantly , we require that dark matter accretion after @xmath22 does not increase the mass within @xmath28 .",
    "such accretion would initially increase the ucmh luminosity , but would also shorten the time wimps survive in the ucmh .",
    "we also assume that annihilation of wimps with small apocenters does not affect our calculations . as a limiting case ,",
    "if wimps annihilate into a constant density core with @xmath74 , then @xmath75 ; this weakens our bounds by a factor of @xmath76 , but still implies @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , since the pbh dominates the mass within @xmath28 , adiabatic contraction should be unimportant .    perhaps the most important other effects we do not consider are those of accreted baryonic material , which may cool radiatively and collapse efficiently .",
    "adiabatic contraction will not be important if the pbh dominates the mass within @xmath28 . however , baryonic matter can be optically thick to gamma rays , reducing the apparent ucmh luminosity .",
    "we estimate the optical depth as @xmath79 . if the mass of baryons within @xmath28 is @xmath80 , then @xmath81 .",
    "klein - nishina effects will reduce this optical depth .",
    "thus for smaller pbhs ( @xmath82 ) , we can ignore baryonic opacity .",
    "neutrino limits are unaffected by opacity .",
    "annihilation of dark matter can produce gamma rays with significant power near @xmath14 . gamma rays below @xmath83 contribute directly to the extragalactic background .",
    "gamma rays with energy @xmath84 for @xmath85 cascade down in energy by pair production and inverse compton processes with ambient photons , contributing to the background at lower energies .",
    "the gamma - ray emissivity of the universe at energies above 100 mev is limited by egret observations to @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the number density of pbhs is then limited to be @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the branching fraction into gamma rays .",
    "if dark matter annihilates into charged particles , there must be internal bremsstrahlung , with branching ratio @xmath15 , which we take as a minimum branching fraction .",
    "this number density is converted into a limit on @xmath89 by multiplying by the mass of the pbh and dividing by the critical density , @xmath90 , so that @xmath91 : @xmath92 the upper limits on @xmath89 are essentially independent of pbh mass : the number of pbhs for a given @xmath89 scales as @xmath93 , but the luminosity of each scales as @xmath61 .",
    "stronger constraints can be obtained by taking advantage of the higher - than - average number density of pbhs in the milky way .",
    "pbhs in the milky way are close enough that annihilation gamma rays are not attenuated ; such gamma rays do not have to compete with the entire gamma - ray background above 100 mev , but only with that near @xmath14 .",
    "suppose the density of pbhs , @xmath94 , tracks the dark matter density .",
    "then the integrated gamma - ray intensity on a line of sight out of the milky way is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the dark matter overdensity over the average cosmic dark matter density and @xmath97 is the average pbh density in the universe",
    ". then the abundance of pbhs is limited by @xmath98 to find the background @xmath99 the ucmh radiation competes with , we use the _ fermi_-measured extragalactic background spectrum @xcite for @xmath100 .",
    "for annihilation into gamma rays or internal bremsstrahlung from charged particles , most of the power is within one log bin in energy of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we therefore find @xmath99 by integrating the gamma - ray background as such .",
    "we use an nfw density profile for the distribution of ucmhs in the milky way , @xmath101 , with @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the line of sight integral is not sensitive to the distribution of ucmhs in the inner galaxy .",
    "the integral is more like that for dark matter decay than diffuse annihilation , since the intensity is _ linearly _ proportional to @xmath104 .",
    "we consider a sightline aimed directly away from the galactic center , where the uncertainty in the profile should have the least effect and the signal is smallest , for a conservative result .",
    "the dependence of @xmath89 with wimp mass is shown in figure  [ fig : boundswithmass ] for various final states .",
    "the galactic gamma - ray bounds in figure  [ fig : boundswithmass ] ( _ solid _ ) include the cosmic background bounds above 100 gev .",
    "the annihilation luminosity falls as the wimp mass increases ( eq .  [ eqn : lannpbh ] ) .",
    "since the competing extragalactic background falls as @xmath105 in the gev to 100 gev range , the allowed @xmath89 increases with wimp mass .",
    "the galactic signal constrains @xmath106 for a wimp mass of 100 gev even if @xmath107 , smaller than the cosmic bound ( eq .  [ eqn : cosmicgammalimits ] ) .    with these abundances",
    ", we can calculate the lower limits on the mean distance to the nearest pbh , @xmath108^{1/3}$ ] , where the local @xmath109 : @xmath110 for wimp masses greater than 100 gev .",
    "this implies a @xmath111-ray flux of @xmath112",
    "unlike gamma rays , neutrinos do not cascade down in energy as they travel through the universe , although they redshift .",
    "we integrate the atmospheric neutrino spectrum ( or diffuse neutrino background limits above 100 tev ) from @xmath113 to @xmath14 @xcite , and require the neutrino flux from ucmhs be less than this ; otherwise , they would have been detected @xcite .",
    "the measured data is reported in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : boundswithmass ] , we show the galactic ( _ solid _ ) and cosmic ( _ dashed _ ) bounds on pbhs from neutrinos .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino background also steeply falls with energy ( @xmath114 ) , so that the bound on @xmath89 is fairly energy - independent up to 100 tev .",
    "in figure  [ fig : pbhfraction ] , we show that even with the uncertainties in our estimates , our constraints are powerful for pbhs inside ucmhs .",
    "pbhs of many masses are ruled out to very small abundances , for a wide range in wimp masses . at high pbh masses ( @xmath115 ) ,",
    "cmb constraints become more powerful @xcite ; at very low masses , hawking radiation limits are more powerful ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "microlensing constraints are weaker , but make no assumptions about wimps @xcite . for @xmath116 , ours are the _ only _ constraints on pbhs aside from @xmath13 .",
    "our conclusion depends on the standard assumption that most dark matter is a self - annihilating thermal relic .",
    "our analysis does not apply if all of the dark matter is made of pbhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because there will not be any wimps to annihilate . for the smallest pbh and wimp masses ( @xmath117 ) ,",
    "radial accretion may not hold .",
    "pbhs could remain important for other reasons ( e.g. , as seeds of massive black holes ; see * ? ? ? * ) which do not require them to have a substantial abundance .",
    "the combination of our results with previous limits imply that pbhs either make up almost all of the dark matter , or almost none of it .",
    "our results could be improved by detailed simulations of how the ucmh evolves as its inner regions annihilate .",
    "annihilation could lower the luminosity of the inner regions of the halo over time , weakening our bounds .",
    "steeper density profiles than @xmath118 may increase the annihilation luminosity , but shorten the lifetime of wimps so that the halo annihilates away before @xmath119 .",
    "we expect that some combination of constraints on gamma - ray and neutrino backgrounds , reionization history , and the cmb energy spectrum will generally require a small @xmath89 .",
    "further improvements could come from more detailed studies of the annihilation products and their detectability .",
    "when considering annihilation into charged particles , we considered only gamma rays from internal bremsstrahlung , but charged particles can themselves radiate , such as through inverse compton scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we are confident the limits for wimp masses above 100 gev can be improved by new observations . finally , @xcite suggest that some ucmhs may exist without pbhs , formed from weaker initial perturbations in the early universe",
