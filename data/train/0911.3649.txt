    "superplasticity is an anomalously high tensile ductility occurring in a growing class of fine grained polycrystalline solids . at rather precise conditions of composition , grain refinement , temperature and strain rate",
    ", they can undergo uniform neckless plastic elongations that may reach thousands of percent prior to fracture .",
    "these large strains occur with no significant change in the grain shapes or sizes , nor in any other fine attribute . as well , different bodies in the superplastic regime of deformation become prone to diffuse one into the other when their surfaces make contact ( diffusion bonding ) . among the many singular features of the phenomenon",
    "is the fairly narrow range of temperatures over which it happens .",
    "for instance , tensile tests for the superplastic titanium alloy ti6al4v give maximum ductility at temperatures close to 1153 k , and elongation to fracture rapidly decays to half the optimal figure within a neighborhood not wider than 200 k around @xcite .",
    "these temperatures are well below the melting point ( 1930 k ) , so we are talking about a genuine solid state effect .    beside the scientific problem it poses ,",
    "superplasticity has acquired considerable technical importance .",
    "after the pioneer work of backofen on the superplastic forming of zn - al sheets by a simple air pressure operation @xcite , as in the fabrication of plastic bottles , and the discovery of a number of high strength superplastic alloys , the subject moved into the scope of engineering materials for advanced applications . since then , the list of high strength superplastic alloys , intermetallic compounds and ceramics has increased notably @xcite , together with the technical knowledge for producing superplastic structures .",
    "a number of present day aluminium superplastic alloys , like al-7475 , al-8090 and supral 220 , or titanium ti-6al-4v and sp700 , have outstanding importance as aeronautic materials @xcite .",
    "superplastic forming combined with diffusion bonding is now a standard technique for producing both engine and airplane structural parts .",
    "the development of light ductile materials of high strength at elevated temperatures has a principal role in the race for more efficient aeroengines .",
    "superplastic titanium and nickel aluminides are drawing great attention in this respect @xcite . having half the density of the current materials , tial - based alloys are promising candidates to replace the nickel - based superalloys in combustion chambers and turbine blades .",
    "after a large plastic deformation with no significant microstructural changes , and resembling a steady flow , superplastic solids collapse at a rather well - defined strain , which depends on temperature and strain rate .",
    "the regular behaviour of superplastic elongation to fracture suggests that the phenomenon is governed by a specific variable , not identified so far , which keeps account for the total strain and produces failure when reaching a precise value .",
    "certainly , the development of cavities may contribute to precipitate collapse @xcite but seems not to be the main cause .",
    "maximum elongation to fracture strongly depends on the strain rate , while the evolution of cavities , when occurring , has been observed to be almost independent of that variable @xcite . moreover , titanium superplastic alloys do not cavitate significantly @xcite .    for decades",
    ", people have been interpreting their observations on the basis of constitutive equations of the form @xmath2 , relating the uniaxial applied stress @xmath3 with the superplastic strain rate @xmath4 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath5 depends on the microstructure and follows an arrhenius dependence with temperature .",
    "a variety of theories give this kind of equation with constant @xmath6 , @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , experiments show that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are never linearly related , as implied by the power law , but the curves display a sigmoidal shape , which is a characteristic feature of the superplastic deformation , and the value of the strain rate sensitivity @xmath6 that fits the data near the inflexion point is usually a non - integral number which vary strongly with strain rate and strain . in many superplastic materials the large ductility is observed even for @xmath8 far from the inflexion point , where the slope @xmath6 has changed , and the strain rate at the inflexion point shifts considerably with strain @xcite .    despite the success of some previous work in accurately predicting the temperature dependent stress _ vs. _",
    "strain rate curves at zero or small strain for a number of superplastic solids @xcite , it rests to explain why are they superplastic . knowing the mechanisms that make the grains to slide past each other and the successful prediction of plastic properties at small strains are not enough to answer this question , and it is necessary to investigate how grains flow over long paths when the solid undergoes a finite deformation .",
    "the literature shows several different theoretical attempts to explain superplastic phenomena , but no one addresses the point of the modifications occurring inside the material when strained up to fracture @xcite , and the dependence of the stress _ vs. _ strain rate curves with strain .",
    "we put forward here a general theoretical approach for the plastic deformation of fine grained solids up to fracture strain .",
    "we assume the grain boundary sliding mechanisms of refs .   and , but refine the study of the grain collective motions in the spirit of ref .  .",
    "the latter is also modified in order to interpret better the physics of the sliding grains . as a general conclusion",
    ", our results prove that the deformation and fracture properties of superplastic solids are governed by general laws amenable of analytical mathematical description , simple and accurate enough to constitute a practical tool for interpreting material tests . though the assorted conglomerate of possible structural defects may affect in specific situations , the main mechanical behaviour of solids is determined by a few parameters associated to the most basic structural properties .",
    "at a scale much larger than the grain size , polycrystalline matter lacks symmetry constrictions and periodicity , and displays same average packing and properties in all directions , and over its whole extention .",
    "however , despite this , assimilating a polycrystal to an homogeneous and isotropic continuum may lead to gross errors , no matter the scale , when dealing with it as a dynamical medium . it has been proven before @xcite , and is revised in this section , that the faceted nature of the structural constituents of a polycrystal , the grains , influences the macroscopic plastic flow in a radical manner .",
    "to explain briefly how this does happen , assume that plastic flow takes place by just grain sliding , and that grains readily accomodate their shapes by slip , so the rate limiting process is the former .",
    "sliding of two adjacent grains occurs when the shear stress in the plane of the common boundary exceeds a critical value @xmath9 .",
    "however , no matter how big the externally applied forces may be , shear stresses vanish in planes whose normals are in the principal directions of the stress tensor . by continuity",
    ", shear stresses in planes whose normals are inside well  defined finite solid angles around the principal directions are smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "hence , many grains are impeded to slide simply because of the orientation of their surfaces @xcite . by this effect",
    ", the material medium ceases to be dynamically isotropic , and cones are created by the very external forces within which no displacement is allowed .",
    "these forbidden cones destroy the kinematic balance and @xmath10 , where @xmath1 represents the velocity field of the flowing medium .",
    "hence , mass density is not locally conserved in the overall plastic flow . the consequent internal pressure",
    "build up helps deformation and , at a critical strain , the material becomes mechanically unstable , undergoing brittle or ductile fracture , depending on the precise physical circumstances .",
    "the internal pressure @xmath11 , which operates in the local microscopic scale , keeps account of cumulated strain and triggers fracture at a precise value of it .",
    "the proper configuration variables in the macroscopic scale are the components @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) of the strain tensor , which , together with their time derivatives @xmath14 , give a complete picture of the dynamical state of the system . however , the evolution of @xmath12 in time is governed by forces excerted between each pair of adjacent grains , and hence the dynamical analysis demands to go first to the grain level .",
    "as the objective is to return to the larger scale , the first task is to establish the connection between the two descriptions .    given the statistics of spatial orientations of the grain boundaries , which may be assumed isotropic from the beginning , one can derive the relation between @xmath14 and the set of the relative velocities @xmath15 between pairs of adjacent grains . to show this , temporarily place the origin o of the coordinate system at a point of a grain surface . then call @xmath1 the velocity of a point p in the positive @xmath16-coordinate axis , which is in another grain boundary distant @xmath17 from o , where @xmath18 is a large natural number and @xmath19 the mean grain size .",
    "( in what follows it will be denoted either @xmath13 or @xmath20 , with @xmath21 ) .    as there are @xmath18 contiguous grains between points o and p , @xmath1 is the sum    @xmath22    where @xmath11 correlatively numbers the adjacent grains along the @xmath16-axis and @xmath23 is the velocity of grain @xmath11 relative to grain @xmath24 at the interface between them . the second term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ec1 ] ) accounts for the assumed deformability of the grains , @xmath25 is the unit vector along the @xmath16axis and @xmath26 stands for the expansion rate of grain @xmath11 along the @xmath16direction .",
    "however , we are considering plastic deformation processes in which grains remain equiaxed in the mean and do not vary significantly their average size . therefore , on this basis , as @xmath18 is large we can set    @xmath27    which means that , statistically speaking , the grains neither stretch nor shrink .",
    "hence    @xmath28    if the solid is being deformed , the components of the displacement of p in a time @xmath29 are    @xmath30    substituting @xmath17 and eq .",

    "if the material is homogeneous and isotropic in the macroscopic scale , the @xmath18 plane grain interfaces intersecting op are oriented in any direction with the same probability .",
    "therefore , one may interpret the sum in eq .",
    "( [ ec4 ] ) as an average which , as @xmath18 is large , runs over all possible orientations of the grain boundaries intersecting op .",
    "however , vectors @xmath15 represent relative velocities between consecutive grains ordered along the positive @xmath16-coordinate axis .",

    "the new feature introduced by the coexistence of two allotropic phases in thermodynamical equilibrium is that a volume reduction is not necessarily related with just the elastic properties of the material .",
    "if the two phases ( which we will call generically as @xmath281 and @xmath282 ) have different specific volumes , the total volume may change also by the transformation of part of one of the phases into the other one .",

    "the plastic flow can be represented by the relation      where @xmath6 is a function of @xmath4 and @xmath194 , generally known as the strain rate sensitivity , which is always smaller than unity . when @xmath299 any irregularity in the cross section of the sample is not accentuated by the deformation in a tensile test , necking has no effect and the material behaves as a newtonian viscous fluid .",
    "necking instability is high for @xmath6 below 0.5 and decreases markedly when @xmath300 .",
    "indeed , the condition of high values of @xmath6 is a necessary requirement , but not enough to reach elongations as large as those termed superplastic .",
    "our previous discussions show that plastic elongation has a limit because demands a volume reduction , and failure is not a matter of just a mechanical instability of geometric origin .",
    "therefore , in our view , superplasticity has its real origin in three concurrent features of the material and physical conditions of the deformation process : ( a ) a high strain sensitivity @xmath6 .",
    "( b ) the ability of the material to reduce the internal pressure @xmath11 by undergoing a phase transformation to a phase of higher density .",
    "( c ) the material must be in the verge of a ductile to brittle transition .",
    "this latter requirement is explained below , taking the superplastic behaviour of titanium ti6al4v to illustrate the argument .",
    "the general properties of the stress _ vs. _",
    "strain curves can be visualized from just examining eq .",
    "( [ ed6 ] ) for the strain dependent flow stress @xmath3 .",
    "it has a first term linear in @xmath194 , with slope proportional to @xmath301 , and a negative logarithmic term whose coefficient increses with @xmath161 .",
    "hence , at low temperatures @xmath3 is linear in @xmath194 and , as @xmath161 increases , the slope decreases and the function develops positive concavity . beyond a critical temperature for which the slope at the origin vanishes",
    "the curve starts at @xmath156 whith negative slope and , after surpassing a minimum , or second yield point , begins to increase monotonically .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ ed6 ] ) predicts strain hardening at any strain for temperatures below a critical temperature , which roughly coincides with the temperature which optimizes superplastic properties . at higher temperatures",
    "the material should weaken for strains between @xmath156 and the second yield point .",
    "this configures a mechanically unstable situation which can not occur in practice in a smooth and homogeneous way .",
    "the equations written so far describe the mechanical response at a point , which does not necessarily can be straightforwardly extended to the whole sample .",
    "homogeneity is a quite reasonable assumption to study averaged properties in the macroscopic scale , but may fail in critical situations .",
    "we can safely assume that @xmath164 and @xmath163 are uniform and constant throughout the material , but @xmath162 depends on the grain size as @xmath278 @xcite , and hence may fluctuate or have a multimodal distribution , following grain size .",
    "there is a class of mild steels @xcite and aluminium alloys @xcite exhibiting stress ",
    "strain curves with two yield points .",
    "the plastic deformation of these materials is inhomogeneous and takes place by a series of succesive sudden band formations ( lders bands @xcite ) , transversal to the tensile axis and making a rather precise angle with it ( of about @xmath302 ) , which concentrate the strain .",
    "the flow stress keeps constant ( though displaying a serrated aspect ) until the bands , increasing in number and extension , fill the whole sample and the complete material becomes strained beyond the second yield point strain .",
    "just then the stress starts to increase . in the intermediate steps ,",
    "samples have sections with no strain and sections strained beyond the second yield strain .",
    "the relevant question is then how a system with the stress  strain curves given by eq .",
    "( [ ed6 ] ) will evolve with strain , and what kind of effective stress ",
    "strain curves could be expected from such evolution .",
    "if our material is not exactly homogeneous the critical temperature for the onset of the second yield point is not the same in its whole extension .",
    "hence , at temperatures close to these critical temperatures and small strain one may expect the solid will be partitioned in a network of sectors hardening on strain , and another one which weakens . as the stress is uniform , the weakening sectors will deform much faster , and will be responsible for the main part of the effective strain before reaching their second yield point .",
    "meanwhile the hardening sectors will furnish mechanical stability against sudden yield steps , like lders band generation .",
    "anyway , the condition for superplastic behaviour seems related with the onset of the second yield point , producing a transition to a potentially unstable system .",
    "such a transition begins at the temperature for which @xmath249 at @xmath156 vanishes and changes from positive to negative sign . on the other hand , generally speaking , the most basic condition for a steady flow , as superplastic deformation tends to be , is that the dynamical variables remain constant and independent of @xmath194 , which here represents time . as @xmath3 varies with @xmath194 ,",
    "all what can be done is to emulate a steady flow by providing the conditions that keep @xmath248 small and steady in a range as large as possible , which incorporates @xmath156 .",
