    "the launch of fermi gamma - ray space telescope will soon open a new era for the studies of rotation - powered pulsars .",
    "the unprecedented sensitivity and spectral resolution of the large area telescope ( lat ) aboard fermi space telescope will allow for detailed studies of particle acceleration and radiation in rotating neutron - star ( ns ) magnetospheres . to make the best use of the power of lat observations , we need the most sophisticated model with minimum assumptions .    in all the pulsar emission models , @xmath0 s and/or @xmath1 s are accelerated by the magnetic - field - aligned electric field , @xmath2 , to radiate photons in the open zone ( fig .  1 in hirotani 2008 , hereafter h08 ) mainly via synchro - curvature process .",
    "in polar - cap ( pc ) models , emission takes place within several ns radii above a pc surface ( arons & scharlemann 1979 ; daugherty & harding 1982 , 1996 ) .",
    "however , such a low - altitude emission predicts too small beam size to produce the observed wide pulse profiles .",
    "therefore , extending the original idea by arons ( 1983 ) , muslimov and harding ( 2003 , hereafter mh03 ; 2004a , b ) and dyks et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter dhr04 ) sought the possibility of a wide hollow cone of high - energy radiation due to the flaring of field lines .",
    "they proposed the slot - gap ( sg ) model , in which emission takes place along the last - open field lines .",
    "recently , harding et al .",
    "( 2008 , hereafter hsdf08 ) demonstrated that the sg model reasonably reproduces the crab pulsar phase - resolved spectrum ( fierro et al .",
    "1998 ; kuiper et al .  2001",
    "; nolan et al .  1993 ) .    the outer - gap ( og ) model gives an alternative possibility ( cheng et al .",
    "1986a , b ; romani 1996 ; cheng & zhang  1996 ; hirotani  2006a , b , hereafter h06a , b ) .",
    "it differs from the sg model in the following ways : @xmath3 an og extends between the null surface on which the magnetic field becomes perpendicular to the rotation axis and the light cylinder on which the plasma co - rotational velocity would exceed the speed of light , @xmath4 .",
    "a sg extends between the pc surface and the light cylinder . @xmath3 for crab , an og occupies more than 10% of the open magnetic fluxes with a large electro - static potential drop , @xmath5  v , whereas a sg occupies several % of the open fluxes with @xmath6  v. @xmath3 pair production copiously takes place in ogs , whereas it is negligible in sgs .",
    "the purpose here is to explore further into the two models .",
    "we examine their common emission properties in   [",
    "sec : analytic ] , and separately consider the og and sg models in  ",
    "[ sec : og ] and [ sec : sg ] . ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] is for discussion .",
    "in this letter , we concentrate on the phase-_averaged _ spectrum of pulsar magnetospheric emissions , sacrificing the examinations of light curves and phase - resolved spectra . in this context",
    ", we can neglect the aberration of photon propagation directions and the time - of - flight delay due to different emission altitudes from the ns , because these two relativistic effects do not change the total number of photons to be detected .",
    "although this thought experiment does not describe any realistic pulsar emissions , it significantly reduces the calculation of photon propagations and gives the correct phase-_averaged _ spectrum .    to investigate the upper limit of photon fluxes",
    ", we neglect photon absorptions .",
    "then the radiative transfer equation gives the specific intensity @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the emission beaming angle , @xmath9 the lorentz factor of @xmath10 s , @xmath11 the local curvature radius of the magnetic field line , @xmath12 the emission coefficient , and @xmath13 the distance interval from which the photons are detected by the observer ( fig .",
    "6.2 in rybicki & lightman 1979 ) . giving the emission coefficient as @xmath14",
    ", we obtain @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the spatial density of @xmath0 s or @xmath1 s , and @xmath17 the radiation power per particle .    at each magnetic azimuth @xmath18 on the pc surface ,",
    "we parameterize the field - line footpoint with their magnetic colatitude @xmath19 measured from the magnetic axis .",
    "we define that the primary photons are emitted only along the field lines threading the pc surface with @xmath20 , where the upper boundary and the last - open field lines are designated with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "we further introduce the dimensionless gap trans - field thickness , @xmath23 . in this letter",
    ", we assume that @xmath24 is constant for both @xmath18 and @xmath25 ( distance along the field line ) for simplicity .",
    "let us introduce the gap meridional thickness @xmath26 that represents the distance between the last - open field line and the upper boundary measured perpendicularly to the field line .",
    "then , the observer detects emissions from the magnetic - flux cross section @xmath27 , where @xmath28 refers to the distance from the magnetic axis , and @xmath29 the _ azimuthal _ full opening angle of the points from which the photons propagate towards the observer . for an aligned rotator ,",
    "the azimuthal length from which the photons propagate towards the observer is given by @xmath30 ; thus , @xmath31 holds . for an oblique rotator , in the outer magnetosphere",
    ", toroidal expansion of the field line flux tubes is similar to an aligned case ; thus , @xmath32 approximately holds .",
    "since @xmath33 holds for a dipole field , we obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the distance from the ns center , @xmath36 the magnetic colatitude , @xmath37 the light cylinder radius , @xmath38 the ns angular frequency .",
    "the magnetic field strength @xmath39 is evaluated at the emission point and related with its surface value @xmath40 by @xmath41 .",
    "the photon energy flux can be computed by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the distance to the pulsar . substituting equations  ( [ eq : inu2 ] ) and ( [ eq : dela2 ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : nufnu ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the charge on the positron ; the dimensionless particle density per magnetic flux tube , @xmath46 , becomes approximately @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the magnetic inclination with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 expresses the typical goldreich - julian ( gj ) particle number density at the pc surface ( goldreich & julian  1969 ) .",
    "it follows from equation  ( [ eq : nufnu2 ] ) that the photon flux @xmath50 does not depend on @xmath51 . for saturated",
    "@xmath0 s or @xmath1 s , electrostatic force balance , @xmath52 , gives the terminal lorentz factor @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the non - corotational potential @xmath56 is given by the inhomogeneous part of the maxwell equations , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote the real and gj charge densities , respectively , and @xmath60 the magnetic field component projected along the rotation axis . the effective charge density , @xmath61 , is parameterized by @xmath62 , which is a function of position . in the newtonian limit",
    ", we would have @xmath63 for a vacuum gap while @xmath64 for a non - vacuum gap .",
    "since @xmath10 s are ultra - relativistic in the gap , the primary emission is dominated by the pure - curvature component .",
    "thus , @xmath65 peaks at @xmath66 with the maximum value @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the modified bessel function of 5/3 order , and @xmath69 the characteristic frequency of the emission .",
    "the electrostatic force balance , @xmath70 , gives @xmath71 for a thin gap ( @xmath72 ) , equation  ( 68 ) in h06a gives @xmath73 where @xmath25 is the distance along the field line .",
    "for the field lines curving away ( or toward ) the rotation axis , @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 ) is the typical range .    substituting @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and combining equations  ( [ eq : nufnu2 ] ) , ( [ eq : dpdnu2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ell ] ) ,",
    "we finally obtain the peak flux , @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the magnetic dipole moment and @xmath80 is close to unity ( see also zhang & cheng  2003 ) .",
    "if we apply @xmath81 , we also obtain the integrated flux , @xmath82 .",
    "note that the factor @xmath83 is proportional to the spin - down flux (   [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that equation  ( [ eq : nufnu3 ] ) estimates the upper limit of the phase-_averaged _ flux .",
    "for example , for an axisymmetric gap in an aligned rotator ( @xmath84 ) , the phase - averaged flux equals equation  ( [ eq : nufnu3 ] ) , which is constant during the whole ns rotation .",
    "since equation  ( [ eq : nufnu3 ] ) holds particularly well for an aligned rotator , and since the phase - averaged flux decreases with increasing @xmath48 ( e.g. , mh03 and dhr04 ) , equation  ( [ eq : nufnu3 ] ) gives the upper limit for general @xmath48 .",
    "the actual flux will be a few times less than equation  ( [ eq : nufnu3 ] ) , because only the field lines in a limited azimuthal range are active , and because the @xmath59 at the pc surface decreases with increasing @xmath48 . in ",
    "[ sec : sg ] , we confirm this by comparing with numerical results .",
    "the difference between the og and the sg models comes into equation  ( [ eq : nufnu3 ] ) through @xmath24 , @xmath62 , and the assumed @xmath79 . in  ",
    "[ sec : og ] and [ sec : sg ] , we apply this equation to these two models , considering the brightest spin - down - flux pulsar , the crab pulsar , assuming @xmath85  kpc .",
    "first , let us apply equation  ( [ eq : nufnu3 ] ) to the og models . using the vacuum ( @xmath86 ) og models of cheng et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , takata et al .  ( 2008 ) and tang et al .  (",
    "2008 ) , which proposed @xmath87 ( i.e. , @xmath88 in their notation ) , we obtain @xmath89 with @xmath90 , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 . the @xmath50 flux peaks at @xmath93  gev .",
    "these results are consistent with their vacuum og models and with the observed phase - averaged spectrum , where the photon flux around gev is dominated by the primary curvature component rather than the reprocessed synchrotron - self - compton one ( takata & chang  2007 ) .",
    "exactly speaking , the vacuum og model is not self - consistent electrodynamically , because it assumes a vanishing charge density while it adopts the gj flux of radiating @xmath1 s .",
    "if one instead adopts the actual @xmath1 flux in a ( nearly ) vacuum og , the predicted @xmath9-ray flux would be a few orders of magnitude less than equation  ( [ eq : nufnu4 ] ) ( left panel of fig .",
    "8 in h06a ) .",
    "that is , equation  ( [ eq : nufnu4 ] ) , and hence the traditional og models reproduce observations only phenomenologically .    secondly , let us consider the non - vacuum og solution , which consistently takes the pair production in the pulsar magnetosphere into account . using @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we obtain @xmath96 which is consistent with the numerical results for crab ( figs .",
    "8 & 9 in h08 ) . in short",
    ", the og model reproduces the observed flux around gev .",
    "thirdly , let us apply equation  ( [ eq : nufnu3 ] ) to the sg model , which adopts @xmath97 ( i.e. , @xmath98 in hsdf08 s notation ) and @xmath99 for the crab pulsar . at the outer part ( @xmath100 ) , where emissivity is large , we obtain @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 . if we adopt the same parameter set @xmath104 and @xmath105 as hsdf08 , and if we adopt @xmath106 , which is derived from the potential drop @xmath107  v in the higher altitudes sg ( hsdf08 ) , equations  ( [ eq : nufnu2 ] ) and ( [ eq : dpdnu2 ] ) give @xmath108 .",
    "this analytical prediction can be confirmed by a numerical computation of the 3-d sg model ( h08 ) .",
    "if we adopt the same parameter set as hsdf08 and if we adopt the same @xmath2 as their equation  ( 4 ) for @xmath109 , we obtain the photon map as figure  [ fig : map ] , which shows a caustic emission from the higher altitudes by virtue of the exclusion of the strong lower - altitude emission . specifying the observer s viewing angle with respect to the rotation axis , and integrating over the entire ns rotation",
    ", we obtain the phase - averaged spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) , which lies much below the observed value . since @xmath106 gives @xmath110 ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : termlf ] ] ) , we interpret that hsdf08 , who adopted @xmath111 , overestimated @xmath112 by the factor @xmath113",
    ".    equation  ( [ eq : nufnu6 ] ) could give the observed flux if @xmath114 .",
    "however , such a large @xmath115 is not allowed in recent analyzes of force - free electrodynamics .",
    "for example , spitkovsky  ( 2006 ) derived @xmath116 , where @xmath117 denotes the ns moment of inertia and @xmath118 the temporal derivative of @xmath38 . imposing @xmath119 ( with @xmath120 and @xmath121 ; e.g. , lattimer & prakash  2000 ) , we obtain @xmath122 for crab .",
    "thus , even hsdf08 s value , @xmath123 , may be a little too large .",
    "in short , equation  ( [ eq : nufnu6 ] ) gives the conservative upper limit and the sg model can explain at most 20% of the observed flux .",
    "if we assume that the spin down follows the dipole radiation formula , @xmath124 , equation  ( [ eq : nufnu3 ] ) becomes @xmath125 where @xmath126 denotes the spin - down flux at the sun .",
    "it was , therefore , natural that the largest spin - down - flux pulsars were preferentially detected with the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) .",
    "the same tendency can be predicted for fermi space telescope .    for young pulsars ,",
    "both @xmath24 and @xmath62 are less than unity ( e.g. , @xmath127 and @xmath94 for crab ) owing to the copious pair production in the magnetosphere . as a result",
    ", @xmath128 becomes much less than @xmath126 as demonstrated by h08 . for middle - aged pulsars , on the contrary , @xmath129 and @xmath130 holds ( hirotani et al .",
    "2003 ) , leading to an increasing ratio of @xmath131 with age .    to explain the observed relationship @xmath132 of pulsed @xmath9-ray emissions ( thompson et al .  1994 ; nel et al .",
    "1996 ) , it is essential to examine the evolution of @xmath24 with age . from equation  ( [ eq : nufnu3 ] ) , we can at least state that the index @xmath133 defined by @xmath134 becomes less than unity , because @xmath24 increases with decreasing @xmath135 , as discussed just above . to examine the evolution of @xmath24",
    ", we must solve the screening of @xmath2 due to the discharge of the produced pairs in 3-d pulsar magnetospheres . in subsequent papers",
    ", we shall look more carefully into this issue , by simultaneously solving equation  ( [ eq : poisson ] ) , the boltzmann equations for @xmath10 s , and the radiative transfer equation under minimum assumptions .",
