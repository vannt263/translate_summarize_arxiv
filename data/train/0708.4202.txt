    "the low frequency gravitational wave window , @xmath3 , is especially rich in astrophysical sources and will be opened by the space - based lisa detector , currently in the formulation stage .",
    "lisa will be sensitive to the coalescence of massive black - hole binaries with total masses in the range @xmath4 to large redshifts @xmath5 at relatively high signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) , and may detect 10 or more such events per year . using such observations , the black - hole masses , spins and luminosity distances",

    "[ sec : outlook ] .",
    "the final coalescence of a black - hole binary is driven by gravitational wave emission , and proceeds in three stages : an adiabatic inspiral , a dynamical merger , and a final ringdown @xcite . during the inspiral ,",
    "the black holes are well - separated and can be approximated as point particles .",
    "the black holes spiral together on quasicircular trajectories , and the resulting gravitational waveforms are _ chirps _ ,",
    "i.e.  sinusoids that increase in both frequency and amplitude as the black holes get closer together .",
    "the inspiral can be treated analytically using the post - newtonian ( pn ) approach , which is an expansion in @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the characteristic orbital velocity ( see @xcite for a review of pn results ) .",
    "the inspiral is followed by a dynamical merger in which the black holes plunge together to form a highly distorted single black hole , producing a powerful burst of gravitational radiation .",
    "since the merger stage occurs in the regime of very strong gravity , a full understanding of this process requires numerical relativity simulations of the einstein equations . after merger ,",
    "the remnant black hole then settles down , evolving towards a quiescent kerr state by shedding its nonaxisymmetric modes as gravitational waves .",
    "the late part of this ringdown stage can be treated analytically using black - hole perturbation theory , and the resulting gravitational waveforms are superpositions of exponentially damped sinusoids of constant frequency @xcite .    in numerical relativity ,",
    "the full set of einstein s equations are solved on a computer in the dynamical , nonlinear regime .",
    "this is typically accomplished by slicing 4-d spacetime into a stack of 3-d spacelike hypersufaces , each labeled by time @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the einstein equations split into two sets .",
    "the constraints give a set of relationships that must hold on each slice and in particular constrain the initial data for a black - hole binary simulation .",
    "this data is then propagated forward in time using the evolution equations .",
    "four freely - specifiable coordinate , or gauge , conditions give the development of the spatial and temporal coordinates during the evolution .    simulating the merger of a black - hole binary using numerical relativity has proved to be very challenging . the first attempt to evolve a head - on collision in 2-d axisymmetry dates back to 1964 @xcite . in the mid-1970s ,",
    "the head - on collision of two equal mass , nonspinning black holes was first simulated successfully , along with the extraction of some information about the gravitational radiation @xcite . in the 1990s ,",
    "fully 3-d numerical relativity codes were developed and used to evolve grazing collisions of black holes @xcite .",
    "however , the codes were plagued by a host of instabilities that caused them to crash before any significant portion of a black - hole binary orbit could be evolved . for many years",
    ", progress was slow and incremental .",
    "recently , a series of dramatic developments has led to major progress in black - hole binary simulations across a broad front .",
    "the first complete orbit of a black - hole binary was achieved in 2004 @xcite .",
    "this was followed by the first full simulation of a black - hole binary through an orbit , plunge , merger and ringdown in 2005 @xcite . in late 2005 ,",
    "the development of new coordinate conditions produced a breakthrough in the ability to carry out accurate and stable long - term evolutions of black - hole binaries @xcite .",
    "these novel but simple `` moving puncture '' techniques proved highly effective .",
    "they were quickly adopted by a broad segment of the numerical relativity community , leading to stunning advances in black - hole binary modeling , starting with evolutions of equal mass , nonspinning black holes and moving quickly to include unequal masses and spins ; ( see , e.g.  , @xcite ) .",
    "the most rapid advances in modeling black - hole binary coalescences cover the previously least understood part of the gravitational waveform , i.e.  the final few cycles of radiation generated from near the `` innermost stable circular orbit '' ( isco ) and afterward , which we call the `` merger - ringdown '' .",
    "there is already considerable progress toward a full understanding of this important `` burst '' portion of the waveform , through which the frequency sweeps by a factor of @xmath11 up to ringdown and during which the gravitational wave luminosity is @xmath12 , more than the luminosity of the combined starlight in the visible universe .",
    "a particularly significant development was the demonstration of initial - data - independence of merger - ringdown waveforms for equal - mass , nonspinning black holes @xcite , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : waves ] .     is the initial coordinate separation of the black - hole centers ( `` punctures '' ) .",
    "all waveforms have been aligned so that the moment of maximum radiation amplitude occurs at @xmath13 ( phase is also set to zero at @xmath13 ) .",
    "the upper panel shows the full extent of all the runs , while the lower panel shows the final merger - ringdown burst .",
    ", width=521 ]    results from four runs with successively larger initial separations are shown ; the waveforms have been aligned so that the moment of peak radiation amplitude in each simulation occurs at time @xmath14 . here",
    "we show the gravitational wave strain from the dominant ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) mode ; this represents an observation made on the equatorial plane of the system , where only a single polarization component contributes to the measured strain .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : waves ] shows the full simulation waveforms , while the lower panel focuses on the final merger - ringdown burst .",
    "note that here and elsewhere in this paper , we use _ geometrical units _ , @xmath17 , to measure time , distance and mass in the same units .",
    "in particular , one solar mass @xmath18 is equivalent to @xmath19 , or @xmath20 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : waves ] , our timescale is the final mass @xmath21 , of the post - merger hole ; this will be less than the initial total binary mass @xmath22 because of gravitational radiation . in the shortest run ( solid line )",
    ", the black holes are placed on initial orbits close to the isco and undergo a brief plunge followed by a merger and ringdown @xcite . at the next - largest initial separation ( dashed line ) ,",
    "the black holes complete @xmath23 orbits before merging @xcite .",
    "the waveforms from the two runs with successively larger initial separations ( dot - dashed and dotted lines , respectively ) then lock on to the merger - ringdown part of this shorter ( dashed ) run .",
    "in fact , the waveforms from the three longer simulations show very strong agreement for @xmath24 , with differences among these waveforms @xmath25 in this regime .    today",
    ", there is consensus that the merger of equal - mass , nonspinning black holes produces a final kerr black hole with spin @xmath26 , and that the amount of energy radiated in the form of gravitational waves , starting with the final few orbits and proceeding through the plunge , merger and ringdown , is @xmath27 @xcite ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "there is also agreement on the overall simple shape of the waveforms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : waves ] , and detailed comparison of results among numerical relativity groups has already begun @xcite .",
    "parameter - space exploration of the merger - ringdown burst , using simulations with various mass ratios @xcite and spins @xcite , is now underway .",
    "the next step is to push this frontier to increasingly complex mass - ratio and spin - orientation combinations , and to establish initial - data independence across these parameters .",
    "simulations starting in the late - inspiral regime and covering more than a few orbits prior to merger are more challenging than shorter merger - ringdown evolutions @xcite .",
    "such long simulations have stronger requirements for numerical stability and place greater demands on computational resources .",
    "in addition , better accuracy is needed to control the accumulation of phase error ; this in turn constrains the numerical error that can be tolerated in the rate of energy loss through gravitational radiation reaction , which governs the inspiral .",
    "so far , the longest simulations have been carried out for equal - mass , nonspinning black - hole binaries , starting at relatively wide separations . the two longest runs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : waves ] undergo @xmath28 @xcite and @xmath29 orbits @xcite , respectively , prior to merger . ] and demonstrate progress in long simulations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that astrophysical black - hole binaries in the late inspiral regime will follow nearly circular orbits , since any initial eccentricity would have been radiated away early in their evolution .",
    "however , in the first long black - hole binary simulations , the eccentricity of the initial orbits was not very well controlled ; in particular , the early part of the waveform shown by the dot - dashed line shows evidence of eccentricity which resulted from the initial data specification .",
    "the dotted curve shows more recent results , which start with very small eccentricity @xmath30 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "such long waveforms make it possible to compare the results of numerical relativity simulations of black - hole binaries with post - newtonian calculations in the late - inspiral regime @xcite , demonstrating remarkable agreement .",
    "the final moments of a black - hole binary merger produce the most intense radiation generated through the strongest gravitational dynamics .",
    "the resulting waveforms are obviously an important part of the observable gravitational wave signature for black - hole binary events . before these recent advances in numerical relativity",
    ", however , little was confidently known about these signals , so that observational analyses of gravitational wave data could only rely on generic `` unmodeled burst '' techniques @xcite rather than more effective matched - filtering techniques , which require detailed knowledge of the expected signals .",
    "consequently the quality of scientific information which could be expected from merger observations has , to date , necessarily been significantly discounted in planning observational work .",
    "just how much more we can learn from observing the final stages of black - hole binary mergers with full knowledge of the waveforms , and how best to apply this knowledge in gravitational wave data analysis , are still largely unanswered questions , which the gravitational wave community is only beginning to address .",
    "we can get some rough impressions of the observational significance of black - hole binary mergers from this new perspective by considering the snr of the full waveforms based on matched - filtering analysis of gravitational wave data @xcite .        estimating the full waveforms by stitching together the most accurate pn model with a numerical simulation of the last several cycles , we have calculated the snr for equal - mass nonspinning binaries @xcite .",
    "[ fig : adligosnrcontour ] shows the contours of snr as functions of redshift @xmath31 and total binary mass @xmath22 for the ground - based adligo detector , which will be sensitive in the frequency range @xmath32hz .",
    "adligo is a planned upgrade of the initial ligo detectors that will increase the sensitivity by roughly an order of magnitude across the  frequency band .",
    "in addition , adligo can be tuned to optimize its sensitivity for different sources . to produce fig .",
    "[ fig : adligosnrcontour ] we used the wide - band tuning typically associated with burst sources , due to its greater sensitivity at higher frequencies , where the merger portion from many sources is predicted to occur @xcite .",
    "this gives an improved snr for most black - hole masses compared to tunings that were optimized for only the early inspiral portion of the coalescence .",
    "may not coalesce within a hubble time @xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lisasnrcontour ] we plot contours of snr for lisa observations , showing that lisa can observe massive black - hole binaries at high snr throughout the observable universe .",
    "lisa is most sensitive to systems with masses in the range @xmath33 , coinciding with the mass range in which models of massive black - hole binaries predict coalescence within a hubble time @xcite and event rates for lisa of at least several per year @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lisaresponse ] we plot a simulated lisa data stream containing a black - hole binary signal as well as noise from the interferometer and the white dwarf confusion noise caused from the unresolvable number of background white dwarf binaries .",
    "this is an example of a typical , non - optimal case in order to demonstrate the relative strength that these signals will generally have .",
    "here we show two @xmath34 black holes at redshift @xmath35 , inclination @xmath36 , polarization angle @xmath37 , ecliptic latitude @xmath38 , and ecliptic longitude @xmath39 .",
    "black holes at redshift @xmath35 , inclination @xmath36 , polarization angle @xmath37 , ecliptic latitude @xmath38 , and ecliptic longitude @xmath39 .",
    "the pseudo - a , e , and t observables are a set of linearly independent combinations of the michelson unequal arm x , y , and z observables at tdi 1.5 @xcite , and are therefore useful in data analysis .",
    "the inset shows a time span of @xmath40 seconds encompassing the time span of the main figure , the main figure being an enlargement of the dash - boxed region of the inset . ]",
    "so far we have restricted our consideration to the example of equal - mass nonspinning black - hole binary mergers .",
    "more detailed considerations of black - hole binary observations must take into account the full parameter space of these systems , which , from the point of view of general relativity , are described by seven parameters , corresponding to the black - hole mass - ratio @xmath41 ( recall that the total mass @xmath22 only scales the waveforms ) , and the spin vector of each hole ( plus two more parameters if eccentric systems are considered ) .",
    "much progress has already been made in conducting numerical simulations to flesh out the basic features of this parameter space ( see , e.g.  , @xcite ) .",
    "first impressions indicate that the waveforms in this parameter space are qualitatively simple , with smooth parameter dependencies .",
    "this suggests that our knowledge of the mergers can ultimately be applied in observations with the aid of smooth analytic waveform models , joining pn treatments of the inspiral signals with analytic approximations to the mergers .",
    "already such a model has been proposed , which provides high overlaps with the numerical simulations for mass - ratios as low as @xmath42 @xcite .    applying the mass scalings from @xcite",
    ", we can estimate the effect of the mass ratio @xmath43 on the computed snrs ; specifically , snr @xmath44 for the inspiral , and snr @xmath45 for the merger and ringdown , where @xmath46 is the _ symmetric mass ratio_. for stellar - mass black - hole binaries , the mass ratios are rather broadly distributed @xcite ; the rates for such mergers may be low , @xmath47 for adligo , depending on the evolution of the original binary through the common envelope phase .",
    "for intermediate - mass black - hole binaries , mass ratios in the range @xmath48 are expected to be the most relevant , with potential rates of @xmath49 per year @xcite ; we note , however , that these rates are far more uncertain than those for stellar - mass black - hole binaries .",
    "investigations of gravitational - wave data analysis based on unequal - mass numerical simulations are now underway : @xcite have investigated how numerical relativity waveforms may be used to select the best post - newtonian template banks for searches in the ligo , adligo and virgo data stream .",
    "astrophysical black - hole binaries are also expected to be spinning , which can potentially raise the snr , for example if there is a spin - induced hangup that generates more gravitational wave cycles in the merger @xcite .",
    "@xcite have investigated how the addition of spins to equal - mass waveforms affects search templates , necessitating the use of higher - order modes for high matches in the ligo band .",
    "we also note that , with more accurate computational modeling , simulations of the merger can be used together with gravitational wave observations to probe gravity in the regime of strong fields .",
    "in particular , if the binary masses and spins can be obtained with good accuracy from observations of the inspiral with lisa @xcite , the merger waveform can be calculated using numerical relativity . with this",
    ", a comparison can be made between the predictions of general relativity  or any other theory of gravity used in a numerical simulation  with observations in the regime of very strong gravity .",
    "black - hole binaries that possess an asymmetry , such as having unequal masses or possessing unequal or unaligned spins , will emit gravitational radiation asymmetrically .",
    "this asymmetric gravitational radiation will impart a linear momentum recoil on the binary s center of mass .",
    "previous attempts to calculate this recoil , or `` kick '' , analytically in the nonspinning case @xcite and for cases with spin @xcite included very large uncertainties , because the dominant part of the kick occurred in the last orbit through the merger , which was very poorly modeled . with the advent of stable , accurate numerical relativity codes ,",
    "the problem of accurately calculating the kick became possible .",
    "several groups have tackled this problem .",
    "the problem of kicks from an unequal mass binary was first investigated in @xcite , where recoils between 86 and 115 km / s for a @xmath50 mass ratio were simulated . in @xcite ,",
    "several simulations were performed and a peak recoil velocity for nonspinning binaries of 175 km / s was found for a mass ratio of @xmath51 .",
    "a flurry of activity began when several groups began simulating kicks from spin asymmetry .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that kicks from spin asymmetry can exceed unequal - mass kicks , and that for an equal - mass configuration with one black hole spinning prograde and the other spinning retrograde with equal magnitude @xmath52 ( a dimensionless spin parameter , varying from 0 for a schwarzschild hole to 1 for a maximally spinning kerr hole ) , the spin kick scales as @xmath53 km / s .",
    "however , it was soon found that the largest kicks are obtained when the spins are antiparallel with each other but perpendicular to the orbital angular momentum , a configuration suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite were the first to perform this simulation , obtaining a kick of @xmath54 km / s for @xmath55 .",
    "@xcite showed that the resulting kick depends sensitively on the angle between the black - hole spin vectors and their velocities .",
    "they found a simple cosine dependence , indicating that @xcite somewhat fortuitously happened upon what is nearly the maximum angle .",
    "furthermore , @xcite projected that for maximal spin , kicks as large as @xmath56 km / s are possible .",
    "kicks of @xmath57 km / s are sufficiently large to kick remnant black holes out of even the largest giant elliptical galaxies . therefore , simulation results this large had to be reconciled with the observational reality that we see massive black holes at the centers of all the galaxies that we have observed above a certain spheroidal mass threshold .",
    "@xcite used the eob formalism to perform a monte carlo simulation in order to try and predict how typical these large kicks are . for mass ratios between @xmath58 and @xmath59 and spins of @xmath60 on both holes , they allowed random orientations among the spin vectors and the orbital angular momentum .",
    "they found that 12% of the remnants received a kick exceeding @xmath61 km / s , and 2.7% received a kick exceeding @xmath62 km / s .",
    "@xcite assume no external influence which might tend to align the spins with each other and with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "however , @xcite investigated the role of the bardeen - petterson effect @xcite in mitigating the gravitational recoil from spin asymmetry . in the absence of gas accretion , the assumption of random orientation in @xcite applies .",
    "however , if a black - hole binary accretes ( 1 - 10)% of its initial mass from an accretion disk , the spin of each hole will align with the angular momentum of the disk , which in turn is aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary . therefore ,",
    "if the majority of mergers occur in gas - rich environments , then the giant kick results , although theoretically interesting , are not astrophysically relevant .",
    "there is good reason to expect supermassive black holes to accrete substantial mass , particularly at larger redshift . in this scenario ,",
    "the configuration of greatest interest is spin orientations aligned with the orbital angular momentum .    fig .",
    "[ fig : kicks ] and table [ tab : data ] present the results of our investigation of this class of configurations , which were first presented in @xcite .",
    "`` ne '' refers to unequal mass , with the corresponding simulations having a mass ratio @xmath63 .",

    "is the absence of an `` unkick '' for the equal - mass case , and the variable size of the unkick in the other cases . also , we observe the expected accelerated merger in the @xmath64 and @xmath65 cases due to spin - orbit attraction , and correspondingly the delayed merger in the @xmath66 and @xmath67 cases due to spin - orbit repulsion .",
    "using our data along with the data from @xcite and @xcite ( which are also included in table [ tab : data ] ) , we are able to construct an empirical kick formula , given by : @xmath68 \\sqrt{(1-q)^2 + 2\\,(1-q)\\,k\\,\\cos\\theta + k^2 } , \\label{eqn : kick_formula}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 .",
