    "we briefly review an attempt to construct a theory that describes _ quantum - classical hybrids _ , consisting of quantum mechanical and classical objects that interact directly with each other @xcite .",
    "hybrids might exist as a fundamentally different species of composite objects `` out there '' , with consequences for the range of applicability of quantum mechanics , or they may serve in an approximate description of certain complex quantum systems .",
    "the concept of quantum - classical hybrids has recently been employed , in order to explore a hypothetical direct coupling of classical time machines to quantum objects @xcite , while the application of hybrid dynamics to the experiment proposed by penrose _",
    "@xcite , which is intended to test the existence of  schrdinger cat \" states of spatially displaced macroscopic objects , and to the manipulation of entanglement among two q - bits is presently under study @xcite .",
    "the direct coupling of quantum mechanical ( qm ) and classical ( cl ) degrees of freedom ",
    "_ `` hybrid dynamics '' _",
    " departs from quantum mechanics .",
    "details of our approach can be found in refs.@xcite , where also additional references and discussion of related works are presented .",
    "hybrid dynamics has been researched extensively for various reasons .",
    " for example , the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics entails the measurement problem which , together with the fact that quantum mechanics needs interpretation , in order to be operationally well defined , may indicate that it needs amendments . such as a theory of the _ dynamical _ coexistence of qm and cl objects .",
    "this should have impact on the measurement problem @xcite as well as on the description of the interaction between quantum matter and ( possibly ) classical spacetime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is of great practical interest to better understand qm - cl hybrids appearing in qm approximation schemes addressing many - body systems or interacting fields , which are naturally separable into qm and cl subsystems ; for example , representing fast and slow degrees of freedom , mean fields and fluctuations , _ etc . _",
    "( see also the article by hu and subasi in this volume for an informative discussion of some related issues @xcite . )    concerning the hypothetical emergence of quantum mechanics from some coarse - grained deterministic dynamics ( see refs.@xcite with numerous references to related work ) , the quantum - classical backreaction problem might appear in new form , namely regarding the interplay of fluctuations among underlying deterministic and emergent qm degrees of freedom . which can be rephrased succinctly as : _ `` can quantum mechanics be seeded ? '' _",
    "thus , there is ample motivation for the numerous attempts to formulate a satisfactory hybrid dynamics . generally , however , they are deficient in one or another respect",
    ". which has led to various no - go theorems , in view of the lengthy list of desirable properties or consistency requirements that `` _ the _ '' hybrid theory should fulfil , see , for example , refs.@xcite :    * conservation of energy . * conservation and positivity of probability . * separability of qm and cl subsystems in the absence of their interaction , recovering the correct qm and cl equations of motion , respectively . * consistent definitions of states and observables ; existence of a lie bracket structure on the algebra of observables that suitably generalizes poisson and commutator brackets . * existence of canonical transformations generated by the observables ; invariance of the classical sector under canonical transformations performed on the quantum sector only and",
    "_ vice versa_. * existence of generalized ehrenfest relations ( _ i.e. _ the correspondence limit ) which , for bilinearly coupled cl and qm oscillators , are to assume the form of the cl equations of motion ( `` peres - terno benchmark '' test @xcite ) .",
    "* ` free will ' @xcite . * locality . *",
    "no - signalling .",
    "* qm / cl symmetries and ensuing separability carry over to hybrids .",
    "these issues have also been discussed for the hybrid ensemble theory of hall and reginatto , which does conform with the first six points listed @xcite but is in conflict with the last two @xcite .    we have proposed an alternative theory of hybrid dynamics based on notions of phase space @xcite .",
    "this extends work by heslot , demonstrating that quantum mechanics can entirely be rephrased in the language and formalism of classical analytical mechanics @xcite . introducing unified notions of states on phase space , observables , canonical transformations , and a generalized quantum - classical poisson bracket ,",
    "this has led to the intrinsically linear hybrid theory to be summarized in the following , which allows to fulfil _ all _ of the above consistency requirements .",
    "recently buri and collaborators have shown that the dynamical aspects of our proposal can indeed be derived for an all - quantum mechanical composite system by imposing constraints on fluctuations in one subsystem , followed by suitable coarse - graining @xcite .",
    "we recall that evolution of a _ classical _ object can be described in relation to its @xmath0-dimensional phase space , its _",
    "state space_. a real - valued regular function on this space defines an _ observable _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , a differentiable function on this smooth manifold .    there always exist ( local ) systems of _ canonical coordinates _ , commonly denoted by @xmath1 , such that the _ poisson bracket _ of any pair of observables @xmath2 assumes the standard form ( darboux s theorem ) : @xmath3 this is consistent with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and has the properties defining a lie bracket operation , mapping a pair of observables to an observable .",
    "general transformations @xmath6 of the state space are restricted by compatibility with the poisson bracket structure to so - called _ canonical transformations _ , which do not change physical properties of an object .",
    "they form a lie group and it is sufficient to consider infinitesimal transformations .",
    "an _ infinitesimal transformation _",
    "@xmath6 is _ canonical _ , if and only if for any observable @xmath7 the map @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 , with some observable @xmath10 , the so - called _ generator _ of @xmath6 , and @xmath11 an infinitesimal real parameter .",
    " thus , for example , the canonical coordinates transform as follows : @xmath12 this illustrates the fundamental relation between observables and generators of infinitesimal canonical transformations in classical hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "0.5 cm    following heslot s work , we learn that the previous analysis can be generalized and applied to quantum mechanics ; this concerns the dynamical aspects as well as the notions of states , canonical transformations , observables , and measurements @xcite . 0.5",
    "cm    the following derives from the fact that the _ schrdinger equation _ and its adjoint are _ hamiltonian equations _ following from an action principle @xcite .",
    "we must add the _ normalization condition _",
    ", @xmath13 , for all state vectors @xmath14 , which is essential for the probability interpretation of amplitudes ; state vectors that differ by an unphysical constant phase are to be identified .",
    "thus , the _ qm state space _ is formed by the rays of the underlying hilbert space .",
    "a unitary transformation describes qm evolution , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 $ ] , solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "thus , a stationary state , characterized by @xmath17 , with real energy eigenvalue @xmath18 , performs a harmonic motion , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath19|\\psi_i(t_0)\\rangle \\equiv\\exp [ -ie_i(t - t_0)/\\hbar ] |\\phi_i\\rangle$ ] .",
    "we assume a denumerable set of such states .",
    "following these observations , it is quite natural to introduce what we may call the _",
    "oscillator representation_.    we expand state vectors with respect to a complete orthonormal basis , @xmath20 : @xmath21 where the time dependent coefficients are separated into real and imaginary parts , @xmath22 .",
    "this expansion allows to evaluate the _",
    "hamiltonian function _ defined by @xmath23 :",
    "@xmath24 choosing the set of energy eigenstates , @xmath25 , as basis of the expansion , we obtain : @xmath26 hence the name _",
    "oscillator representation_.  evaluating @xmath27 according to hamilton s equations with @xmath28 of eq.([hamiltonianqm1 ] ) or ( [ hamiltonianqm2 ] ) , gives back the schrdinger equation .",
    " furthermore , the _ normalization condition _ becomes : @xmath29 thus , the vector with components given by @xmath30 , is confined to the surface of a @xmath31-dimensional sphere with radius @xmath32 , which presents a major difference to cl hamiltonian mechanics",
    ".    the @xmath33 may be considered as _",
    "canonical coordinates _ for the state space of a qm object .",
    "correspondingly , we introduce a _ poisson bracket _ , cf .",
    "eq.([poissonbracket ] ) , for any two _ observables _ on the _ spherically compactified state space _ , _",
    "i.e. _ real - valued regular functions @xmath34 of the coordinates @xmath33 : @xmath35 as usual , time evolution of an observable @xmath36 is generated by the hamiltonian : @xmath37 . in particular , we find that the constraint of eq.([oscillnormalization ] ) is conserved : @xmath38 .      in the following , we recall briefly the compatibility of the notion of observable introduced in passing above  as in classical mechanics  with the usual qm one .",
    "this can be demonstrated rigourously by the implementation of canonical transformations and analysis of the role of observables as their generators",
    ". for details , see refs.@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian function has been defined as observable in eq.([hamiltonianqm1 ] ) , which relates it directly to the corresponding qm observable , namely the expectation of the self - adjoint hamilton operator .",
    "this is indicative of the general structure with the following most important features .      ",
    "classical canonical transformations are automorphisms of the state space which are compatible with the poisson bracket .",
    "automorphisms of the qm hilbert space are implemented by unitary transformations .",
    "this implies a transformation of the canonical coordinates @xmath33 here . from this , one derives the invariance of the poisson bracket defined in eq.([qmpoissonbracket ] ) under unitary transformations .",
    "consequently , the _ unitary transformations on hilbert space are canonical transformations on the @xmath39 state space_.       any infinitesimal unitary transformation @xmath40 can be generated by a self - adjoint operator @xmath41 , such that : @xmath42 , which leads to the qm relation between an observable and a self - adjoint operator . by a simple calculation ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath43 from these equations , the relation between an observable @xmath44 , defined in analogy to classical mechanics ( as above ) , and a self - adjoint operator @xmath41 can be inferred : @xmath45 _ i.e. _ , by comparison with the classical result .",
    "hence , a _ real - valued regular function @xmath44 of the state is an observable , if and only if there exists a self - adjoint operator @xmath41 such that eq.([goperator ] ) holds_. this implies that _ all qm observables are quadratic forms _ in the @xmath46 s and @xmath47 s , which are essentially fewer than in the corresponding cl case .",
    "interacting qm - cl hybrids require additional discussion , cf .",
    "below .       from the relation ( [ goperator ] ) between observables and self - adjoint operators and the poisson bracket ( [ qmpoissonbracket ] ) one derives : @xmath48|\\psi\\rangle   \\;\\;,\\ ] ] with both sides of the equality considered as functions of the variables @xmath22 and with the commutator defined as usual .",
    "hence , the _ qm commutator is a poisson bracket with respect to the @xmath39 state space _ and relates the algebra of its observables to the algebra of self - adjoint operators .",
    "0.5 cm    in conclusion , quantum mechanics shares with classical mechanics an even dimensional state space , a poisson structure , and a related algebra of observables .",
    "it differs essentially by a restricted set of observables and the requirements of phase invariance and normalization , which compactify the underlying hilbert space to the complex projective space formed by its rays .",
    "the far - reaching parallel of classical and quantum mechanics , as we have seen , suggests to introduce a _ generalized poisson bracket _ for qm - cl hybrids : @xmath49 \\label{genpoissonbracketdef }   & : = & \\sum_k\\big ( \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial_{x_k}}\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial_{p_k } } -\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial_{p_k}}\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial_{x_k}}\\big ) +    \\sum_i\\big ( \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial_{x_i}}\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial_{p_i } } -\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial_{p_i}}\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial_{x_i}}\\big )   \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of any two observables @xmath50 defined on the cartesian product of cl _ and _ qm state spaces .",
    "it shares the usual properties of a poisson bracket . ",
    "note that due to the convention introduced by heslot @xcite , to which we adhered in sect .",
    "[ qumech ] , the qm variables @xmath22 have dimensions of ( action@xmath51 and , consequently , no @xmath52 appears in eqs.([genpoissonbracket])([genpoissonbracketdef ] ) . at the expense of introducing appropriate rescalings",
    ", these variables could be made to have their usual dimensions and @xmath52 to appear explicitly here .",
    " for the remainder of this article , instead , we choose units such that @xmath53 .",
    "let an _ observable `` belong '' to the cl ( qm ) sector , if it is constant with respect to the canonical coordinates of the qm ( cl ) sector_. then , the @xmath54-bracket has the important properties :    * it reduces to the poisson brackets introduced in eqs.([poissonbracket ] ) and ( [ qmpoissonbracket ] ) , respectively , for pairs of observables that belong _ either _ to the cl _ or _ the qm sector . *",
    "it reduces to the appropriate one of the former brackets , if one of the observables belongs only to either one of the two sectors .",
    "* it reflects the _ separability _ of cl and qm sectors , since @xmath55 , if @xmath56 and @xmath57 belong to different sectors .",
    "hence , _ if a canonical tranformation is performed on the qm ( cl ) sector only , then observables that belong to the cl ( qm ) sector remain invariant .",
    "_      the hybrid density @xmath58 for a self - adjoint density operator @xmath59 in a given state @xmath14 is defined by @xcite : @xmath60 using eq.([oscillexp ] ) and @xmath61 .",
    "it describes a _ qm - cl hybrid ensemble _ by a real - valued , positive semi - definite , normalized , and possibly time dependent regular function on the cartesian product state space canonically coordinated by @xmath62-tuples @xmath63 ; the variables @xmath64 and @xmath65 are reserved for cl and qm sectors , respectively .",
    "note that the relation between an observable in @xmath39-space and a self - adjoint operator , eq.([goperator ] ) , can be written as : @xmath66 , with the qm pure state acting as one - dimensional projector here . concerning the hybrid density @xmath58",
    ", we may use the representation of @xmath59 in terms of its eigenstates , @xmath67 , to obtain : @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    " this shows that @xmath71 is the _ probability density to find in the hybrid ensemble the qm pure state _",
    "@xmath14 , parametrized by @xmath22 through eq.([oscillexp ] ) , _ together with the cl state _ given by a point in phase space , specified by coordinates @xmath72 .",
    "further remarks about superposition , pure / mixed , or separable / entangled qm states that may enter the hybrid density can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "generally , the simplest observable - like form of @xmath58  a bilinear function of qm `` phase space '' variables @xmath22 , as above  has to be replaced for interacting hybrids , allowing for the form of an _ almost - classical observable _ ; see sect .",
    "5.4 in @xcite and a more detailed study discussing measurements in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the density @xmath58 evolves according to the hybrid liouville equation ( see the following subsection ) .",
    "this will lead to a solution @xmath73 that is not necessarily bilinear in the qm variables @xmath22 .",
    "however , we can ( re)construct the self - adjoint density operator for the qm subsystem of the hybrid by : @xmath74 i.e. , conditioned on the state of the cl subsystem parametrized by @xmath75 and consistent with eq.([rhodens ] ) ; the measure of integration here has been evaluated in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the _ liouville equation _ for the evolution of hybrid ensembles @xcite must be based on the generalized poisson bracket defined in eqs.([genpoissonbracket])([genpoissonbracketdef ] ) and liouville s theorem .",
    "this leads us to : @xmath76 with @xmath77 and : @xmath78 defining the relevant hamiltonian function , including a hybrid interaction ; @xmath79 is required to be an _",
    "observable _ , in order to have a meaningful notion of energy .",
    " note that _ energy conservation _ follows from @xmath80 .",
    "finally , the liouville equation describes a hamiltonian flow , which implies that : + @xmath81 the normalization and positivity of the probability density @xmath58 are conserved in presence of a hybrid interaction ; hence , its interpretation remains valid under hybrid evolution .",
    "besides constructing the qm - cl hybrid formalism , as outlined here , and showing how it conforms with the strong consistency requirements presented in sec .  2.1 , we earlier discussed the possibility to have classical - environment induced decoherence , quantum - classical backreaction , a deviation from the hall - reginatto proposal @xcite in presence of translation symmetry , and closure of the algebra of hybrid observables @xcite .",
    "questions of locality , symmetry vs. separability , incorporation of superposition , separable , and entangled qm states , and ` free will ' were considered in ref.@xcite , while an exotic application to ( a class of ) time machines coupled to quantum mechanical degrees of freedom has been shown in ref.@xcite and further studies of the penrose _",
    "_ experiment , designed to study reduction ( or not ) of macroscopic schrdinger cat states @xcite , and of entanglement control are underway @xcite .",
