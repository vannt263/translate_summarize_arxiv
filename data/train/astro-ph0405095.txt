    "the observation of a tight correlation between the velocity dispersion @xmath1  of the bulge in a galaxy and the mass of its nuclear black - hole @xmath0  was a surprising discovery over the last few years ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "even more surprisingly , the above relation for normal galaxies was also found to extend to active galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "a lot of theoretical models provide explanations for the @xmath0@xmath1  relation in the framework of models of galaxy formation , black hole growth and the accretion history of active galactic nuclei ( @xcite , @xcite ) . to understand the origin of the @xmath0@xmath1  relation , and to discriminate among the models , it is of interest to follow the tracks of agns on the @xmath0 @xmath1 plane .",
    "mathur  ( 2001 ) suggested that the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) , a subclass of seyfert galaxies believed to be accreting at a high eddington rate , do not follow the @xmath0@xmath1  relation .",
    "here we present our results based on a complete sample of 75 soft x - ray selected agn .",
    "note also that nls1s are interesting objects as they occupy one extreme end of the `` eigenvector 1 '' relation of agns ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most widely accepted paradigm for nls1s is that they accrete at close to the eddington rate and have smaller black hole masses for a given luminosity compared to bls1s .",
    "finding their locus on the @xmath0@xmath1  plane is therefore a worthwhile experiment anyway as we will either find that they occupy a distinct region compared to bls1s or that they do nt .",
    "the first option is interesting for our understanding of black hole growth . on the other hand if we find that nls1s follow the @xmath0@xmath1relation like the bls1s , it has important implications towards our understanding of the agn phenomenon .",
    "we already have good evidence for smaller bh masses of nls1s , at a fixed luminosity .",
    "if they follow the @xmath0@xmath1  relation , it would imply that nls1s preferentially reside in galaxies with bulges of smaller velocity dispersion .",
    "this would be direct evidence for the dependence of agn properties on their large scale galactic environment .",
    "we use luminosity and fwhm(h@xmath2 ) as surrogates for black hole mass and fwhm([oiii ] ) as a surrogate for the bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "see grupe & mathur ( 2004 ; paper i here on - wards ) for the details of sample selection and for the validity of our method to estimate @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
    "figure 1 shows that bls1s and nls1s occupy two distinct regions in the @xmath0 @xmath1   plane . for a given velocity dispersion nls1s tend to show smaller smaller black hole masses than bls1s .",
    "if true , this is an important result .",
    "we emphasize that this is a statistical result ; errors on both @xmath0  and @xmath1  are large ( figure 1 ) .",
    "as discussed in paper i , this is not due to systematically underestimating bh masses of nls1s .",
    "moreover , bh mass estimates using two completely different methods give the same result : in mathur  2001 , @xmath0  was determined by fitting accretion disk models to seds and in czerny 2001 , power - spectrum analysis was used .    }",
    "$ ] vs. log @xmath3(h@xmath2 ) .",
    "nls1s are marked as open circles and bls1s as filled squares .",
    "black hole masses are given in units of @xmath4 .",
    "the solid line marks the relation of @xcite .",
    "the cross at the bottom right hand corner represents a typical error bar.,width=188 ]    in paper i we also scrutinize the use of fwhm([oiii ] ) as a surrogate for the bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "clearly , there is a large scatter in the @xmath5}-\\sigma_*$ ] relation . the important thing to note , however , is that there is no systematic _ difference _ for the two classes bls1s and nls1s .",
    "we also explore possible problems specific to nls1s , like strong feii emission and [ oiii ] asymmetry , and find these do not affect the result either .",
    "we thus conclude that bls1s and nls1s occupy distinct regions in the @xmath0 @xmath1   plane .",
    "this is clearly seen from figure 2 which plots the cumulative distribution of the ratio log(@xmath0/@xmath1 ) for bls1s and nls1s .",
    "the two classes are significantly different , with formal kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test probability of being drawn from the same population @xmath6 .     for the two subsamples of nls1s .",
    "the large @xmath1  sources also appear to be with large @xmath7 , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   for the two subsamples of nls1s .",
    "the large @xmath1  sources also appear to be with large @xmath7 , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    in paper i , we interpret this result in terms of black hole growth : black holes grow significantly by accretion in well formed bulges and they reach the @xmath0@xmath1  relation eventually as the growth is complete .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the models of miralda - escud & kollmeier ( 2004 ) and also with the suggestion of nls1s being young agns ( mathur 2000 ) . while our statistical result is robust , the same is not obvious about its interpretation",
    "this is because some nls1s lie on/ very close to the @xmath0@xmath1  relation ( figure 1 , mathur  2001 , @xcite ) .",
    "two nls1s in ferrarese  ( 2001 ) also lie on @xmath0@xmath1  relation . if we are to interpret the observations in terms of black hole growth by the highly accreting nls1s , why have some nls1s already reached their `` final '' mass ?    the first hint towards the resolution of the above conflict came from the observations of williams , mathur & pogge ( 2004 ) . in _",
    "chandra_observations of nls1s , they found a significant fraction with flat x - ray spectra , and with low accretion rate relative to eddington ( m ) . in the framework of the black hole growth scenario , such objects",
    "may then be the ones close to the @xmath0@xmath1  relation , as they would have already gone through their high m state and their black holes accumulated most their mass .    to test this hypothesis",
    ", we divided our nls1 sample in two parts , with low and high values of @xmath1 with a boundary at log@xmath8}$]=2.3 .",
    "the choice of the boundary came from visual inspection of figure 1 , where it appears that the nls1s with log@xmath8}$ ] below this value tended to be much closer to the @xmath0@xmath1relation .",
    "figure 3 compares the distribution of @xmath9 for the two samples .",
    "the k - s cumulative distribution for the two samples is significantly different with the formal k - s test probability of being drawn from the same population p=0.05 .",
    "consistently , we also find that the low @xmath1  nls1s have flatter x - ray spectra .",
    "the above results show that nls1s are a mixed bag , some with steep @xmath10 but some with flat and some with large m and some with small .",
    "the objects with large m are the ones which lie below the @xmath0@xmath1  relation of dead black holes and black holes with low m. thus the interpretation presented in paper i appears to be secure : black holes grow in mass substantially in their highly accreting phase .",
    "as they grow , they approach the @xmath0@xmath1  relation for normal galaxies .",
    "the mass growth in a low accretion phase , as in bls1s and also in some nls1s , appears to be insignificant .",
    "any theoretical model attempting to explain the @xmath0@xmath1  relation will have to explain the above observations .",
    "needless to say , it is vital to measure @xmath0  and @xmath1  accurately to confirm the above result .",
    "black hole mass estimates based on h@xmath2 widths are quite secure , but the same can not be said about estimates of @xmath1  based on [ oiii ] widths . *",
    "even if fwhm([oiii ] ) is not a good surrogate for @xmath1 the nature of our result is such that @xmath5}-\\sigma$ ] would then have to be _ different _ for bls1s and nls1s * , and this is most likely not the case as discussed in paper i. moreover , there is no observational result to support such a difference .",
    "if nls1s had larger outflows , then they could have disturbed their narrow - line regions more compared to bls1s .",
    "again , there are no observations supporting such a case ; on the contrary , absorbing outflows are seen less often in nls1s ( leighly 1999 )",
    ". larger @xmath11 in nls1s does not necessarily imply larger effective radiation pressure . on the contrary , in objects with large soft x - ray excesses , like nls1s , the _ absorbed _ radiation is actually much smaller ( morales & fabian 2002 ) .",
    "there is also general lore that highly accreting sources with large m should have large outflows .",
    "while low efficiency accretion must lead to outflows ( as in adios , blandford & begelman 1999 ) , the same is not true for efficient accretion as in bright seyferts and quasars .",
    "large outflows are observed in highly accreting sources like broad absorption line quasars , but that depends upon the ratio of gas supply to eddington accretion rate , and is not inherent to the accretion process itself ( r. blandford , private communication ) .",
    "bulge velocity dispersion is usually measured with caii triplet line and this technique has been used to measure @xmath1  in two nls1s ( ferrarese 2001 ) . however , for many of the nls1s in our sample , the caii lines fall in the water vapor band in the earth s atmosphere . in many nls1s",
    "for which caii line is accessible from ground , caii is observed in emission rather than in absorption ( rodriguez - ardila 2002 ) .",
    "this makes use of caii absorption features to determine @xmath1  difficult for the targets of interest .",
    "we plan to use two different methods for alternative estimates of @xmath1 : ( 1 ) use of the co absorption band - head at 2.29 microns to measure @xmath1  directly ; and ( 2 ) high resolution imaging of the nls1 host galaxies to measure surface brightness distribution of bulges .",
    "one can then use the fundamental plane relation to determine @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , we will determine the bulge luminosities and find the locus of nls1s on the @xmath0-l@xmath12 relation .",
    "once again , the objective is to find out if there exists a statistical difference in the ratio of black hole mass to bulge luminosity for the two populations of bls1s and nls1s .",
    "we plan to use all these methods to fully understand the role of accretion in black hole growth , and to determine the locus of highly accreting agns on the @xmath0bulge relations .",
