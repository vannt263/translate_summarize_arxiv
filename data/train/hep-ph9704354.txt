    "the starting point for most advanced calculations of nonleptonic kaon decays is an effective weak lagrangian of the form @xcite @xmath3 which can be derived with the help of the wilson operator product expansion from elementary quark processes , with additional gluon exchanges . in the framework of perturbative qcd the coefficients @xmath4 are to be understood as scale- and normalization scheme dependent functions .",
    "there exist extensive next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations @xcite in the context of kaon decays , among others .",
    "these calculations are based on the possibility of factorization of short- and long - range contributions , i.e. into wilson coefficient functions @xmath4 and mesonic matrix elements of four - quark operators @xmath5 , respectively . the latter , however , can presently be obtained only by using nonperturbative , i.e. model - dependent , methods .",
    "but still it seems not possible so far , to fulfil the obvious requirement of scale- and renormalization scheme invariance of the resulting amplitudes in a satisfactory way .",
    "usually , the results of calculations are displayed with the help of @xmath6-factors in the form @xmath7",
    "< \\pi\\pi |{\\cal o}_i|k>_{vac.sat.}\\,,\\ ] ] where the mesonic matrix elements of four - quark operators are approximated by their vacuum saturation values which are , of course , @xmath8-independent . in principle , @xmath9 should be estimated by some higher - order calculations in the long - range regime , for instance , in @xmath10-expansion @xcite in the form @xmath11 , or from the lattice approach .",
    "the preliminary stage of these calculations is best characterized by the problem to explain the well - known @xmath12 rule quantitatively .",
    "of course , the lack of such calculations for long - range effects severely restricts the predictive power of ( [ weak - lagr ] ) , leaving only the possibility of some semi - phenomenological treatment @xcite , with correspondingly large theoretical uncertainties . as a matter of fact ,",
    "some of the combinations @xmath13 $ ] have to be fixed by experimental data , while others are restricted by additional theoretical arguments .",
    "a logical improvement of this approach , pursued in @xcite , is to take the lagrangian ( [ weak - lagr ] ) as defining the structure of the @xmath14 weak interaction and to submit it to a global confrontation with data by sandwiching it between appropriate initial and final states ( for instance , charged and neutral kaons , respectively @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , ... states ) .",
    "of course , there would be hardly any gain in predictive power , if we stuck to the vacuum saturation approximation because there may be large unknown factors involved , when switching between different initial / final states of the same operator .",
    "it is evident that everything could be absorbed into the @xmath18-factors which thereby would not only be scheme- and scale - dependent , but would also change with the initial / final states ( becoming even unknown ( complex ) functions of dynamic variables for final states ) . on the other hand , these latter changes should be avoided or , at least , diminished when using a consistent higher - order calculation of the mesonic matrix elements in the framework of chiral theory which today is , certainly , the most developed approach to long - range hadronic phenomena in general .",
    "these higher - order calculations after the inclusion of meson loops have their own scale dependent renormalization ambiguities . in the ideal case",
    "these meson loops should cancel the scale dependence of the wilson coefficients from the perturbative qcd calculation ( resulting in @xmath6-factors equal to 1 ) .",
    "as a complete match is lacking so far , the best one can do is to fix the long - range ambiguities in a definite way at an explicitly or implicitly given scale while considering the wilson coefficients times ( unknown ) @xmath6-factors as phenomenological constants .",
    "as the above - mentioned perturbative qcd calculations in nlo are believed to be reliable down to a scale of @xmath19 ( in @xcite the charm quark mass @xmath20 gev is used as a matching scale ) , it is very desirable , however , that the effective scale for the long - range calculation reaches this value too .",
    "therefore , our strategy includes a consistent calculation of the matrix elements up to @xmath0 , and furthermore some consideration of the effects from vector , axial - vector and scalar resonances which can be included by the procedure of reduction @xcite , i.e. a certain recalculation of structure coefficients of the effective chiral lagrangians involved .    in this note",
    "we reconsider in the above manner especially the @xmath1 channels with matrix elements of four - quark operators calculated at @xmath0 in momentum expansions within the chiral lagrangian approach .",
    "this approach is based on the bosonized version of the weak lagrangian ( [ weak - lagr ] ) and chiral effective meson lagrangians of higher orders with the structure coefficients fixed by bosonization of the four - quark njl - type interaction . according to weinberg s power - counting scheme @xcite , the calculation involves tree - level , one- and two - loop diagrams .",
    "the method of superpropagator regularization @xcite was used to fix uv divergences arising at the loop level .",
    "the aim of this note is to give the first numerical results of this calculation concerning @xmath1 amplitudes as they lead to new estimates of @xmath2 ( see section  3 ) . in section  2 and appendices",

    "a value of @xmath184 would be required in order to reach @xmath185 , which is far above its phenomenological limits derived within the usual chiral framework .",
    "since our results are very sensitive to the relative contribution of the gluonic penguin operator , the question of its phenomenological separation in @xmath1 decays becomes critical , in the context of the @xmath12 rule as well as for the very important problem of direct @xmath103-violation , where at least one experimental result @xcite would lead to some revision of the present picture .",
    "@xmath103-conserving @xmath1 data alone are clearly not sufficient for such a separation .",

    "as emphasized above , the reason for this possibility is found in the difference in momentum power counting behaviour between penguin and non - penguin matrix elements , which appears in higher orders of chiral theory , when calculating various parameters of differential distributions , for instance , slope parameters of the dalitz - plot for @xmath186 .",
    "a substantial improvement in the accuracy of such experimental data ( mostly being of older dates ) would be very helpful for such a phenomenological improvement of the theoretical situation for @xmath2 ( see @xcite for a discussion of this point and @xcite for some recent measurements ) .",
