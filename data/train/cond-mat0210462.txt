    "in quasi - one dimensional materials like halogen - bridged transition metal chain complexes , conjugated polymers , organic charge transfer salts , or inorganic blue bronzes , the itinerancy of the electrons strongly competes with electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions which tend to localize the charge carriers by establishing commensurate spin or charge - density wave ground states ( gs ) . at half filling band ( bi ) or mott ( mi ) insulating phases are favored over the metallic state .",
    "quantum phase transitions between the insulating phases are possible and the character of the electron excitation spectra reflect the properties of the different gs .",
    "a controversial issue is the nature of the bi - mi transition as well as whether or not only one critical point separates both insulating phases in purely electronic model hamiltonians@xcite . despite their importance in low dimensional materials@xcite phonon dynamical effects",
    "will be ignored in this paper which will be concerned with the so - called one dimensional ( 1d ) ionic hubbard model ( ihm ) , just a hubbard model with a staggered potential which displaces by @xmath8 the energy levels of even and odd sites .",
    "it is described by the hamiltonian    @xmath9    where electrons of spin @xmath10 hop with amplitude t between nearest - neighbor inequivalent sites of energy level @xmath11 ( @xmath12 in what follows ) .",
    "electrons of opposite spin on the same site feel a repulsion @xmath0 .",
    "this model hamiltonian , originally proposed by nagaosa @xcite and later by egami@xcite as a model ferroelectric , is ideal for studying the issue of quantum phase transitions in electron systems . on general grounds",
    "one expects a transition to occur from an ionic band insulator to a strongly - correlated mott insulator  as @xmath0 increases .",
    "evidence for such a transition was found in exact - diagonalization calculations by resta et al @xcite predicting a metallic point at a critical value @xmath13 separating both insulating phases .",
    "this transition is signaled by a polarization jump with a sign change associated with a site parity change of the gs .",
    "the same conclusion was supported by gidopoulos et al@xcite , who showed the reversal of site parity above to be of magnetic origin , thus leading to a vanishing of the spin gap , @xmath14 .",
    "likewise , brune et al@xcite by means of the bosonization technique along with lanczos and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations lent support to this picture .    on the other hand , fabrizio et al@xcite",
    "shed new interest into the ihm in a field - theoretical bosonization analysis where they propose a new scenario for the intermediate region , @xmath15 , between the bi and the mi .",
    "the model should instead exhibit two quantum phase transitions : one from a bi state to a long - range bond - ordered ( bo ) state predicted to be in the ising universality class and a second one from the bo to the mi state predicted to be a kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "such transitions to bo states have recently been found in 1d hubbard models with extended interactions ( u - v ) by nakamura@xcite . the bo state is a broken symmetry state in which the system becomes ferroelectric due strictly to electron - electron interactions even if all the atoms are at centers of inversion .",
    "this is also called the spontaneously dimerized insulating ( sdi ) phase , which , as argued by fabrizio et al@xcite , implies a finite spin gap , @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "such a sdi phase has been observed numerically by wilkens and martin@xcite in a variational quantum monte carlo study .",
    "more precisely , they found one transition from the bi to the correlated sdi phase , but no second transition to the mi phase which is approached asymptotically by the sdi phase as @xmath4 .",
    "recent dmrg calculations @xcite lead to mutually conflicting results .",
    "thus whereas takada and kido@xcite support the resta et al@xcite picture of a single first - order transition , qin et al@xcite support the fabrizio et al @xcite scenario of two second - order quantum phase transitions .",
    "in this paper we present the one - electron spectral - weight function a(k@xmath18 ) of the ihm .",
    "the calculation is done by means of a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation in the grand canonical ensemble suplemented  by an approximate effective action .",
    "its eigenvalues and eigenvectors alow us to construct explicitly dynamic correlation functions in real time or frequency .",
    "this procedure leads to spectral functions with a reasonably high resolution .",
    "the calculation is performed at a relatively large inverse temperature , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 in what follows ) , which brings the system very close to its gs properties .",
    "our calculated a(k@xmath21)clearly shows metallic character ( non - vanishing density of states in the gap ) at @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , between two critical u values instead of a single metallic point at the first threshold .",
    "thus a double bi - m - mi smooth transition is predicted , the intermediate metallic regime at u@xmath24 being both antiferromagnetic ( af ) and dimerized",
    "in our calculations , we use the qmc approach in the grand canonical ensemble , which has been explained in detail by hirsch@xcite and white et al@xcite .",
    "as is well - known , the partition function is factorized into @xmath25 time slices of extent @xmath26 . for hubbard models ,",
    "the interaction @xmath27 is transformed into a discrete ising field@xcite , @xmath28 , which depends on lattice site @xmath29 and imaginary time @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "the non - interacting hamiltonian for a given ising configuration ( a definite allocation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 values for all the @xmath34 is ) reads@xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 the first term on the rhs of eq(3 ) is just the hopping term of the ihm , eq(1 ) . in the second term",
    ", @xmath37 is the chemical potential , @xmath38 for up / down electron spin , and @xmath39 is a non- linear function of @xmath0 given by @xmath40.in the limit @xmath41 the partition function can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 means summing over the ising configurations and @xmath44denotes taking the trace over the electron degrees of freedom .",
    "@xmath45 is the @xmath46-independent part of @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 being the average ising spin at the @xmath29-th site .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 is @xmath51-independent in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "we adopt this effective @xmath51-independent hamiltonian , for doing measurements even if the number of time slices used in the calculation is finite .",
    "to minimize as much as possible size effects due to a finite @xmath25 , we shall increase @xmath25 and seek for convergence .",
    "needless to say , the update of the ising field is done following the standard procedure of , say , ref 15 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian matrix for each spin @xmath52 ( eq(3 ) with @xmath53instead of @xmath54 ) is now diagonalized and , in terms of its eigenvalues @xmath55 and eigenvectors @xmath56 , we can construct correlation functions in real time or frecuency .",
    "for instance @xmath57 for the causal green s functions and likewise for other quantities . as customary , @xmath58is the fermi - dirac distribution and @xmath59 a vanishingly small imaginary part .",
    "all these quantities must now be averaged over the accepted ising configurations to obtain the final result .",
    "it is just in this averaging process where the correlation effects are restored .",
    "since the final result is translationally invariant , one can fourier transform and find the spectral - weight function ( swf ) @xmath60 and the dos @xmath61 which can also be obtained from ( 6 ) as @xmath62 , @xmath63 being the corresponding imaginary part of @xmath64 . for our case of the ihm , this last route allows to calculate the partial dos for even / odd atoms by simply restricting the sum over even / odd sites .",
    "as noticed earlier , this building procedure leads to a good resolution of spectral features .",
    "we characterize the system by its one - electron swf , @xmath65 , along with the charge and spin structure factors , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , defined as the fourier transform of the static charge and spin , respectively , correlation functions .",
    "these are given as usual by @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 being the charge and spin at the @xmath72 site and @xmath73 .",
    "this type of characterization is useful and can be of help in understanding the electronic properties of a system .",
    "for instance , the swf tells us the presence or absence of gaps or pseudogaps as @xmath74 increases , which is of fundamental importance in establishing the insulating or metallic character and possible transitions between them of , say , the ihm .",
    "likewise , the evolution of @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath0 , especially theirs peak at @xmath75 , gives information about the charge or magnetic origin of the transitions .",
    "for @xmath76 and u / t ( t=1 ) values lying in the three coupling regimes of the ionic hubbard model .",
    "the qmc calculation has been made for a periodic chain of eighty sites an @xmath77    as hinted before , it is just the structure of @xmath65 at @xmath78 which accounts for the insulating or metallic character of the ihm .",
    "hence , fig 1 shows this quantity for three values of @xmath0 ( recall that @xmath20 ) so selected to exhibit the three fundamental regimes of the model .",
    "the calculation has been done for a chain of eighty sites with periodic boundary conditions at half filling and @xmath79 .",
    "typically 150 time slices , two hundred warm sweeps and one thousand measurements were taken . at @xmath80 , a two - peak structure with a clear gap in between signals an insulating system . at @xmath81 ,",
    "both peaks have overlapped developing a third peak just at the midpoint of the gap ( which becomes the fermi level ) .",
    "this three - peak structure clearly shows a metallic system .",
    "finally , at @xmath82 the central peak splits into two peaks leaving a gap in between .",
    "this four - peak structure signals again an insulating system which must be somehow of a different kind from the initial one ( see below ) .",
    "as @xmath0 increases ( not shown ) the central gap widens and the four peaks go over into a two - peak structure as @xmath83 , the system becoming then a mott insulator .     at @xmath78 ( a=1 ) and e=0 ( midgap which becomes the fermi level ) as u increases .",
    "same calculations of fig .",
    "1 ]    in order to estimate the approximate extension of the metallic region , fig 2 shows the evolution of the spectral density at @xmath78 and @xmath84 ( the midgap ) as @xmath0 increases .",
    "we see a maximum at @xmath85 an onset threshold at @xmath86 and a falloff with an approximate endpoint at @xmath87 @xmath88 ev leaving a zone of metallicity @xmath89 .",
    "since this quantity may be size - dependent , we proceed to a finite - size scaling in order to approach the thermodynamic limit .",
    "calculations made on chains of 8,12,16,80,120 , and 160 sites show that @xmath89 is roughly independent of size , but @xmath90 tends to go up , extrapolating to 2.50 when @xmath91 .",
    "notice that only finite chains of @xmath92 sites should be used since only them have @xmath78 as an allowed wave vector .",
    "chains of other lengths fail to detect the metallicity . in the thermodynamic limit , of course",
    ", all chains have a wawe vector infinitessimally close to @xmath93        the three - peak structure responsible of the metallic phase disappears as soon as one departs from @xmath78 , showing a single mainly occupied peak at @xmath94 and a mainly empty peak at @xmath95 ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 being the number of sites ) .",
    "hence the metallic peak should be visible in angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and its inverse , but not in integrated measurements which give the dos , eq ( 8) .",
    "since the weight of that structure falls with @xmath97 ( fig 3 ) , only a pseudogap with a sizeable dos at the fermi levels should be seen .       of the charge , @xmath66 ( triangles ) , and the spin , @xmath67 ( circles ) , structure factor , as u increases , for the 80-sites periodic chain . ]",
    "fig 4 finally displays the evolution of the peak of @xmath66 and @xmath67 at @xmath98 for increasing u. the charge factor consistently drops from a high value at @xmath80 , which signals a strong cdw in correspondence with a large ionicity ( the fractional ionic character of the bond is @xmath99 ) which also falls down monotonically .",
    "the system , therefore starts as an ionic band insulator at small u. the spin structure factor starts close to zero , corresponding to a paramagnetic insulator , and monotonically increases with u , signaling an af sdw of increasing amplitude . for large u ,",
    "the systems evolves into a mott insulator with a strong af sdw and a vanishingly small cdw , i.e. , zero ionicity ( neutral ) .    in the intermediate regime , @xmath100 ,",
    "the system is both increasingly af and neutral ( decreasing ionicity , i.e. , decreasing cdw ) . on the other hand , table i displays a small sector of the density matrix ( @xmath101 ) , for @xmath81 just the top and left @xmath102 matrix , which is sufficient to show that the metallic state of this intermediate regime is dimerized .",
    "thus @xmath103 , etc , indicating that the sites ( @xmath104 ) , ( @xmath105 ) , and so on , form dimers .",
    "these dimers weaken for @xmath106 and tends to disappear as @xmath4",
    "our qmc study shows three coupling regimes in the ionic hubbard model : ( @xmath29 ) an ionic band insulator below @xmath107.(@xmath108 ) an increasingly antiferromagnetic and dimerized metal which is gradually becoming neutral in the intermediate coupling regime @xmath109 . and",
    "( @xmath110 ) an increasingly af and neutral insulator whose dimerization , measured by @xmath111 , is gradually dropping away for @xmath106 .",
    "this last regime tends to a mott insulator a @xmath4 .",
    "a remark is here in order .",
    "although the spectral - weight function at @xmath112 seems to hint a critical separation among the three coupling regimes ( a threshold and an endpoint ) , the smooth behavior of all the integrated quantities ( dos , ionicity , energy , charge and spin structure factors , etc . ) rather suggest a smooth interpolation between the three regimes which should be distinguished from true quantum phases with sharp , critical , separation among them .    to conclude ,",
    "let us finally say that the results of our qmc calculations would be quite similar to those of resta et al @xcite , wilkens and martin@xcite , etc , if the metallic zone reduced to a single point . on the other hand , they would also be quite close to those of fabrizio et al @xcite should the intermediate regime reported in this letter turn out to be insulating ."
