    "noise may be a relevant perturbation to many kinds of population dynamics .",
    "effects of population fluctuations have been investigated for several models , for example , predator - prey models @xcite , epidemic models @xcite , the ricker model @xcite , evolutionary game theories @xcite , and pattern formation @xcite .",
    "since the birth - death process of individuals is stochastic , the population of each species always fluctuates due to the finiteness of the number of individuals , known as demographic stochasticity .",
    "demographic stochasticity is an endogenous phenomenon , and the species populations may fluctuate , even in a constant environment . population dynamics with demographic stochasticity are more realistic than the corresponding deterministic description which is valid for infinite populations in constant environments , and they often show nontrivial dynamics which can not be predicted by the deterministic equations . for a particular predator - prey system @xcite , the demographic stochasticity causes oscillations , while the system is asymptotically stable under the corresponding deterministic population dynamics .",
    "since the demographic stochasticity effectively adds uncorrelated noise to the population dynamics , the oscillations at the eigenfrequencies are amplified by a large factor .",
    "hence , the effect of the demographic stochasticity is much larger than the one estimated by naive @xmath2 estimates . for a neutrally stable system @xcite ,",
    "the noise effect becomes even more drastic : only one species can survive and the others die out after a sufficiently long time , while the corresponding deterministic model predicts the coexistence of the species , with regular oscillations .",
    "stochasticity may also influence the outcome of the evolutionary dynamics . in small populations ,",
    "the evolutionary branching is delayed compared to the case of larger populations , and the delay strongly depends on the absolute population size @xcite .",
    "several empirical data sets are also compared with theoretical models and are described better by models with stochastic population dynamics @xcite .",
    "thus , population fluctuations , which inevitably exist in any finite system , may drastically alter the predictions of deterministic models and often cause decreases in biodiversity .",
    "a major goal of this paper is to investigate the effects of demographic stochasticity in models of biological community assembly on evolutionary time scales .",
    "several models to bridge ecological and evolutionary time scales have been suggested , such as the tangled - nature model @xcite , simplified versions of that model @xcite , the webworld model @xcite , the scale - invariant model @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "more concretely speaking , these are population dynamics models with additional rules for the introduction and extinction of species .",
    "new species , whose interaction coefficients are assigned by a rule , are added to the community at a certain rate ; and the extinction of resident species can happen due to the population dynamics . evolution is modeled by repeating the introductions and the extinctions of species in these models .",
    "potential numbers of species are much larger than the number of species coexisting at the same time . if the population dynamics have a noise term , the emergent communities can be nontrivially different from the communities selected without this noise .",
    "this is because the speciation events that trigger large changes at the population level invariably involve single or very small numbers of individuals that are highly susceptible to statistical fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the main issues we address here are the noise effects on ( i ) the properties of the emergent communities and ( ii ) the statistics of the evolution dynamics , especially the intermittency during evolution .    in this paper , we use the simplified versions of the tangled - nature models and study the effects of demographic stochasticity . for these models ,",
    "the fixed point and the linear stability around it for a given community are analytically obtainable .",
    "this helps us estimate the relevance of the noise in the population dynamics .",
    "furthermore , long - term dynamics on evolutionary time scales are studied extensively , and @xmath0 fluctuations and power - law duration distributions are found for these models .",
    "we show that the dynamics observed for the individual - based models may undergo qualitative changes from the corresponding models with deterministic population dynamics .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : models ] , the models are defined , and some topics related to these models are discussed .",
    "results of the simulations are shown in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ subsec : diversity - decline ] , we show how population fluctuations affect the diversity , and in section [ subsec : long - term ] , we explore the dynamics on evolutionary time scales . section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "some mathematical details are discussed in appendices [ sec : f - fluc]-[sec : b - b - const ] .",
    "the models considered here are extensions of the tangled - nature model studied in @xcite .",
    "the tangled - nature model is an individual - based model , originally introduced by hall and co - workers @xcite and later simplified by rikvold and zia @xcite . in the simplified models @xcite",
    ", the population evolves stochastically in discrete , non - overlapping generations . in these models , each individual of species",
    "@xmath3 gives rise to @xmath4 offspring with a reproduction probability @xmath5 before it dies .",
    "otherwise it dies without offspring .",
    "the reproduction probability @xmath5 for an individual of species @xmath3 in generation @xmath6 depends on the individual s ability to utilize the amount @xmath7 of available external resources , and on its interactions with the population sizes @xmath8 of all the species present in the community at that time .",
    "the form of @xmath5 is discussed in the following subsection .    in the individual - based models , species populations evolve stochastically .",
    "the probability @xmath9 that @xmath10 out of @xmath11 individuals of species @xmath3 succeed in producing offspring is given by the binomial distribution , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the binomial coefficient and @xmath14 is the probability that an individual of species @xmath3 gives rise to offspring in that generation .",
    "thus , the mean and variance of the number of offspring are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we consider an approximation to the binomial distribution by the gaussian distribution with mean @xmath15 and variance @xmath16 in order to control the strength of the stochasticity .",
    "the following stochastic difference equation is used for the population updates : @xmath17 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are a control parameter for the noise strength and a gaussian random number with mean @xmath20 and variance @xmath21 , respectively . when @xmath22 , this update algorithm is a good approximation for the corresponding individual - based model , while it is deterministic when @xmath23 .",
    "although there is no easy interpretation except for @xmath23 and @xmath21 , we use several intermediate values of @xmath18 in order to investigate the crossover between deterministic and individual - based models .",
    "the population size @xmath24 is a positive real number while it is a positive integer in the original individual - based models .",
    "the approximation by the gaussian distribution to the binomial one is known to be quite good when @xmath25 is sufficiently large .",
    "typically when @xmath15 and @xmath26 are greater than five , the approximation is good .",
    "even when @xmath25 is small , we expect that the approximate model still captures the essence of the population fluctuations in the individual - based model , although the population dynamics for species with very small populations are critical for the emergence or extinction of species .",
    "since it is not necessary to draw random numbers for every individual , this update rule is computationally more efficient than the true individual - based model and enables us to run simulations for longer times .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the model so that the number @xmath4 of offspring per individual follows a stochastic process .",
    "( see appendix [ sec : f - fluc ] . ) in that case , the fluctuations are even more enhanced and the difference from the deterministic models are more important . in this paper , however , we limit ourselves to the case that @xmath4 is fixed for simplicity . even with this model , the differences between stochastic and deterministic population dynamics are observed as shown later .    to mimic an evolutionary process , speciation and extinction of species",
    "are introduced .",
    "new species are added to the system by `` mutation '' of resident species .",
    "these rules are formulated in section [ subsec : addition ] .",
    "extinction of a species happens when its population becomes less than a threshold value , @xmath27 .",
    "when the @xmath3th species goes extinct , this species is eliminated from the system , i.e. , the number of degrees of freedom decreases by one .",

    "the reproduction probability @xmath36 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath37 , ranging over @xmath38 .",
    "thus @xmath37 is a measure of the fitness of species @xmath3 . for a large positive @xmath37 ( small birth cost , strong coupling to the external resource , and more prey than predators )",
    ", @xmath5 goes to one and the population of species @xmath3 increases . in the opposite limit of large negative @xmath37 ( large birth cost , weak or no coupling to the external resources , and/or more predators than prey )",
    ", @xmath5 goes to zero and the population decreases rapidly .",
    "the nonlinear dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath37 thus limits the growth rate of the population size , even under extremely favorable conditions for species @xmath3 .",
    "two types of reproduction probabilities are considered in this paper : model a and model b. model a has no restriction on the form of the interaction matrix @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , each species makes various types of interactions with others , including predator - prey , mutualistic , and competitive interactions .",
    "in contrast , the interspecies interactions are limited to predator - prey interactions in model b. this is realized by the limitation that the off - diagonal part of @xmath32 must be antisymmetric ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath40 and @xmath41 , then species @xmath3 is the predator ( or parasite ) and @xmath42 the prey ( or host ) , and vice versa .",

    "model a was introduced and studied in @xcite . in this model ,",

    "communities tend to evolve toward mutualism in model a.    in model b @xcite , the external resource @xmath7 is introduced .",

    "an abiotic resource @xmath7 is introduced that is renewed each generation at the same level ( here , @xmath50 ) and does not have independent dynamics .",
    "the off - diagonal part of the interaction matrix is limited to be antisymmetric .",

    "is not included in this model ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath55 the birth cost term and the negative diagonal elements @xmath56 prevent species populations from growing to infinity . the fecundity @xmath4 for model b is set to @xmath57 .",
    "with this value , the dynamics for a single species approaches its fixed point monotonically .",
    "these models have fixed points @xmath58 , which can be calculated exactly @xcite . here",
    "@xmath58 is a column vector of the equilibrium population sizes of all species present in the community .",
    "linear stability around this fixed point can also be estimated .",
    "see appendix [ sec : fp - calculation ] for these solutions .",
    "communities are assembled through mutations of resident species as follows .",

    "all the species - specific values , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath45 , are predetermined at the beginning of the simulation and fixed during the simulation . in every generation",

    ", the number of individuals belonging to species @xmath3 , @xmath64 is calculated by rounding off the population size , @xmath65 , and the total number of individuals is @xmath66 .",

    "the coefficients of species @xmath3 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath45 ) have no correlation with those of its neighbor species , which is a less realistic aspect of the model .",
    "however , the model captures the aspect that the number of mutant species accessible from a given community is limited @xcite .",
    "models to overcome this problem have also been proposed , and it is confirmed that the phenotypic correlation does not qualitatively alter the long - term fluctuations @xcite .    each simulation run was started with a single , randomly chosen species ( producer species for model b ) with a population size of @xmath69 individuals .",
    "the details of this initial condition are totally insignificant , and the systems were completely `` thermalized '' during the initial warm - up periods .",
    "we also note that the results shown below do not show qualitative dependence on the precise values of @xmath59 and @xmath63 for reasonable ranges .",
    "if the mutation rate is too high , the system shows mutational meltdown and the number of species diverges . for too short @xmath59 ( typically @xmath70 ) ,",
    "the system is trapped in a certain state and the species composition never changes .",
    "we choose parameters so that these unrealistic cases are excluded and simulations are computationally feasible .",
    "in this section , we focus on the effects of the demographic noise on the community structure .        first we show how the population fluctuations affect the growth of the community diversity .",

    "here we do not use a finite - size correction @xcite for the estimation of @xmath77 for simplicity .",

    "the diversity measure and the total population size show larger fluctuations , and the species composition changes quickly . on the other hand , during the quiet periods , the species composition remains nearly constant , and the system is considered to be in a quasi - steady state ( qss ) .",
    "the evolution proceeds intermittently , rather than gradually , like a stick - slip motion , repeating active and quiet periods .",

    "figure [ fig : b - sad ] shows the sad for model b with @xmath84 and @xmath21 . since the system without demographic stochasticity does not reach a stationary state , we divided the time series for @xmath84 into three regions ; @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are the regions where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 million generations , respectively , in order to see how the distribution changes during the evolutionary process . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the data are calculated for @xmath91 million generations , where a statistically stationary state is realized . during the simulation",
    ", there are many species with small populations , which correspond to unsuccessful mutants .",
    "we filtered out unsuccessful mutants and obtained the `` core fixed - point communities '' by updating the population dynamics without the noise and mutations until all the fixed - point populations analytically calculated from the interaction matrix ( eq .  ( [ eq : exact_sol ] ) ) became larger than the extinction threshold .",
    "the sads were calculated for these fixed - point communities .",
    "the sads for these communities are quite similar , while the peak position shows dependence on @xmath18 .",
    "the sad for @xmath73 has a peak at higher population size than for @xmath84 .",
    "the number of species with small populations are suppressed by the noise , and a small number of large - population species survive , which is a natural consequence of the law of large numbers .",
    "the difference in height corresponds to the difference in diversity between @xmath84 and @xmath21 .",
    "the profile is well fitted by a function suggested by pigollotti et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are fitting parameters .",
    "this function interpolates between the well - known fisher s log - series and the log - normal distributions .",
    "the agreement of the fitting function for @xmath84 is reasonable although there is some difference at @xmath95 . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the fitting is reasonable only around the peak .",
    "the data have fatter tails than the function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sad ] ) .",
    "since the noise term for the fixed - point community is of order @xmath96 , the noise term is of the same order as @xmath97 if @xmath98 . simply comparing with the sads , which peak at @xmath99 ; the noises are less than the corresponding population sizes for most of the species .",
    "however , if the system has weak linear stability , the noise may have relevant effects and cause extinctions of species .",
    "the eigenvalues of the linear stability matrix , @xmath100 , are therefore estimated , and their probability density functions are shown in fig .",

    "the distributions for model b show peaks slightly below @xmath21 , which means the system is asymptotically stable , but the linear stability is weak .",

    "thus , more stable communities are selected under the stochastic noise .",
    "we estimated how large the population fluctuations would be if the noise corresponding to @xmath73 were applied to the fixed - point communities . following the discussion in @xcite",

    "this approximation is valid only when the population fluctuations are small enough to neglect the nonlinearity of the population dynamics .",
    "although this assumption is not satisfied for model b , this discussion tells us that the population fluctuations could be of the same order as the population sizes and might cause extinctions .",
    "how the covariance matrix @xmath105 is calculated is shown in appendix [ sec : g - calculation ] .",
    "here we only show the distribution of the square root of the eigenvalues of @xmath105 , which correspond to the size of the population fluctuations . the distribution is shown in fig .",

    "the population fluctuations for @xmath84 would be of the same order as the population sizes .",
    "thus , the noise drives the species with little stability to extinction , and , as a result , cause the large decline in diversity .",

    "the effects of demographic stochasticity are explored for two types of biological macro - evolution models .",
    "the demographic stochasticity is modeled by the noise term of the population dynamics . for the mutualistic communities obtained by model",
    "a , the noise does not have an important effect , and the deterministic description does not alter the picture obtained for the corresponding individual - based model . on the other hand , the predator - prey model ( model b ) shows a remarkable decline in diversity at higher noise levels .",
    "this is because the deterministic population dynamics allow species to coexist with low linear stability , which are pushed into extinction in the stochastic population dynamics . without the noise ,",
    "the distribution of the birth cost @xmath108 has a sharp peak close to zero , while the distribution of the coupling constants @xmath45 is almost the same as the original distribution . with moderate noise",
    ", the selection pressure for small @xmath108 becomes less extreme , and species with larger @xmath45 are selected .",
    "hence , strongly coupled communities are selected under the noise , while species with low birth costs are selected at low noise levels .    for model",
    "b , species must have a strong coupling to the external resource or strongly predatory interaction coefficients compared to the birth cost to sustain their populations .",
    "( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta - modelb ] ) . )",
    "our result that communities with larger @xmath45 are selected under the noise looks contradictory to the classical consensus on the relation between stability and complexity : a community tends to be less stable when the interactions are dense and strong @xcite .",
    "this apparent contradiction is due to the antisymmetric correlation of the linear stability matrix .",
    "the off - diagonal parts of the linear stability matrix in model b is closer to an antisymmetric form .",
    "the ratio @xmath139 often becomes negative since the interaction matrix @xmath140 is antisymmetric .",
    "eigenvalues originating from antisymmetric off - diagonal matrix elements are all pure imaginary , therefore the large @xmath45 do not destabilize the system significantly .",
    "actually , the distribution of the diagonal parts @xmath141 is similar to the distribution of eigenvalues , which implies that contributions of the off - diagonal parts are not critical . moreover , if the average predation rate is large compared to the birth cost , species tend to have larger equilibrium populations .",
    "that makes the species have higher resistance against the demographic noise .",
    "thus , large @xmath45 often leads to larger equilibrium populations without sacrificing the linear stability .",
    "we speculate that such selection of stronger coupling interactions occurs in a wide class of predator - prey population dynamics models under demographic noise .",
    "the dynamics on evolutionary time scales for model b is also altered by the noise .",
    "when an appropriate amount of noise is applied , the system shows approximate @xmath0 fluctuations in the evolutionary dynamics .",
    "the time series consist of long quiet periods , during which the species compositions are steady , and short active periods , in which rearrangements of species compositions occur with relatively large - scale extinctions .",
    "the duration distribution for the quiet periods is an approximate power law , and @xmath0 fluctuations are found for the diversity index and the total population size .",
    "however , in the limit of no demographic stochasticity , this intermittent dynamics is replaced by a more gradual one , and the time series of the diversity index and the population size become ornstein - uhlenbeck processes . as the noise increases ,",
    "the @xmath1 psds gradually change toward @xmath0 fluctuations .",
    "we speculate that this is due to the smallness of the mutant s population and the weak linear stability . since mutants are quite prone to go extinct under the demographic noise , qss communities are more robust against the invasions of new species .",
    "similar effect is also reported in another model @xcite .",
    "the results shown in this paper indicate that models without noise may be remarkably different from models with noise . without demographic noise , communities with weak stability that would be destroyed under",
    "the noise can emerge .",
    "since the noise effect can be more important than suggested by a naive @xmath142 prediction , the relevance of demographic stochasticity is not limited to small - scale communities , such as isolated islands , lakes , and experimental situations in microbiology , but can also exist for larger - scale ecosystems .",
