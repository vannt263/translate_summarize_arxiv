    "<S> active matter can be ` wet ' , i.e. , coupled in bulk to a momentum - conserving solvent , or ` dry ' , i.e. , for instance in contact with a momentum - absorbing wall . </S>",
    "<S> ` wet ' active systems include not only bacterial swarms in a fluid , the cytoskeleton of living cells , and biomimetic cell extracts @xcite , but also synthetic colloidal swimmers in a fully bulk geometry . </S>",
    "<S> such swimmers may in future offer a toolbox for directed assembly of new materials in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> many of these artificial colloidal swimmers are spherical objects , with asymmetric coatings that cause them to move through a bath of fuel and/or under illumination with light @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> of particular importance is the ` active liquid crystal ' ( alc ) theory @xcite , which starts from a passive fluid of rod - like objects @xcite with either a polar order parameter @xmath4 @xcite , or a nematic one @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> there is one important effect of activity that alc models do not capture ( unless added by hand @xcite ) : motility - induced phase separation ( mips ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if their propulsion speed falls fast enough with density ( e.g. , due to crowding interactions ) , even purely repulsive active particles phase - separate into dense and dilute domains . </S>",
    "<S> mips is by now well - established , at least for ` dry ' models such as brownian dynamics simulations of self - propelled colloidal spheres @xcite . unlike the physics of alcs , mips does not depend on alignment interactions @xcite , and can be captured at continuum level by a scalar concentration field @xmath0 alone , without direct appeal to order parameters @xmath4 or @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is pertinent to spherical colloidal swimmers @xcite , which ( although not entirely devoid of alignment interactions @xcite ) are not orientationally ordered in the passive limit , contrary to the alc premise . the theory of  scalar active matter \" , with mips as its main feature , has been developed so far only for dry systems @xcite . following the same path as for passive systems @xcite culminates in a dynamical scalar @xmath9 field theory , called ` active model b ' @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we extend this simplest scalar active matter model to the wet case . for passive systems it is well known how to couple a diffusive , conserved , phase - separating order parameter ( see passive model b @xcite ) to an isothermal fluid flow ; the result is called ` model h ' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we follow a similar path , but find that activity deeply alters the relation between the stress and the scalar order parameter . at first sight , our final equations resemble closely those of passive model h , in which the domain size @xmath10 scales linearly in time , @xmath11 , as found from a force - balance between interfacial tension @xmath12 and dynamic viscosity @xmath13 . on closer inspection though , the active equations involve two separate tensions , one in the diffusive and one in the mechanical sector </S>",
    "<S> . the second of these can be ( and for pure mips actually is ) _ negative for contractile particles_. as a result , while extensile systems show relatively normal domain growth , contractile ones should cease to coarsen at a certain scale , set by a balance between loss of interfacial area through diffusive coarsening , and its creation under the action of the contractile stress . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath30 is not a genuine free - energy functional , and in the simplest mips theory , it stems solely from the density - dependence of the propulsion speed @xcite . nonetheless , </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , for nonzero @xmath25 no functional @xmath30 exists for which @xmath31 @xcite , giving active model b. thus only the @xmath25 term violates trs in the macroscopic equations , even if the physical origins of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 also do so microscopically .    </S>",

    "<S> our previous work on active model b shows @xmath25 to have benign effects on dynamics : its main effect is to shift the coexistence condition between phases which now obey an ` uncommon tangent ' construction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> once this shift is allowed for , standard diffusive dynamics ( e.g. , ostwald ripening @xcite ) holds qualitatively ; although simulations show deviations from the expected power law @xmath46 , these likely represent a slow crossover to that asymptote @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> specifically , we can use standard power - counting arguments @xcite to estimate the dynamics of the domain size @xmath10 . setting @xmath49 for simplicity and ignoring inertia ( which leads to a third regime at very late times @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find that ( see appendix [ aiii ] ) @xmath50 here , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are dimensionless constants ; @xmath53 is the interfacial tension in @xmath9 theory . when activity is nonzero but small , @xmath54 and the tension @xmath55 differs slightly from @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the two contributions to @xmath56 in eq .   are related to gradients in @xmath26 and thus laplace pressure @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the first is diffusive ( so @xmath56 is a flux proportional to @xmath58 , where @xmath12 is unperturbed since @xmath49 ) ; @xmath2 does not enter here . </S>",
    "<S> the second is hydrodynamic ( balancing a viscous stress @xmath59 against @xmath60 ) . when @xmath61 , eq </S>",

    "<S> is unlikely to change this outcome , since eq </S>",
    "<S> .   rests on little more than dimensional analysis @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the opposite limit is that of pure mips , where there are no attractions between particles and every coefficient in active model h is set by far - from - equilibrium physics ( primarily , the dependence of a particle s swim speed on the local density @xcite ) . in a trs system the form of @xmath30 stems from a hamiltonian that determines the diffusive ( from @xmath65 ) and mechanical ( from @xmath37 ) currents in a thermodynamically consistent way . </S>",
    "<S> however , as already mentioned , in mips , @xmath30 is merely a mathematical construct ; there is no hamiltonian ( even for @xmath49 ) and hence no link between @xmath24 and @xmath2 . indeed , whereas @xmath24 is always positive , @xmath2 can have either sign as we now show .    </S>",
    "<S> the argument is based on simple kinematics as developed in @xcite . for a system of swimmers with a propulsion speed @xmath66 that depends on position ( or particle density @xmath67 ) but not on swimming direction @xmath68 , the first and second orientational moments of the distribution function @xmath69 obey @xcite @xmath70here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 is the orientational relaxation time ; the particle density @xmath67 is the zeroth orientational moment of @xmath69 ; and st denotes the symmetric traceless component . </S>",

    "<S> equation is purely kinematic in origin : wherever @xmath76 has a gradient , there are more particles pointing ( i.e. , moving ) down this gradient than up it , causing nonzero @xmath4 @xcite .    for self - propelled particles , the leading - order mechanical stress is , as for alcs , caused by their exerting force dipoles on the fluid @xcite . in general </S>",
    "<S> we can write this as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are activity parameters . however , from eq .   </S>",
    "<S> it follows that if @xmath80 is a function of density only ( as assumed to this order in theories of mips @xcite ) , @xmath81 is a pure pressure gradient and thus ignorable . </S>",
    "<S> expanding eq .   </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath82 with prime denoting a @xmath67 derivative , we recover eq .  , where @xmath83 the sign of @xmath2 then depends only on whether swimmers are extensile ( @xmath84 ) or contractile ( @xmath85 ) . </S>",
    "<S> time - reversal interchanges these two cases , so the active contribution to @xmath2 in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is odd under it , unlike any passive part . finally , although @xmath86 vanishes for spherical swimmers at low density @xcite it does not do so in general . </S>",
    "<S> the only tensor from which to construct a stress contribution is @xmath87 , whose mesoscopic average at low but finite density gives @xmath5 but not @xmath88 @xcite . at high density , where swimmers interact strongly and correlations develop between orientations and interparticle coordinates , the reasons given in @xcite for the vanishing of the @xmath88 term no longer apply . ]    in keeping with our earlier discussion of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> we now suppress the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , one could alternatively retain @xmath89 in eq .   as part of a ` best - fit ' procedure to a more detailed kinetic theory of mips </S>",
    "<S> ( see appendix [ aiv ] ) ; we have checked numerically that the results are broadly similar to those with constant @xmath2 reported in what follows .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we assume that local diffusive relaxation normal to interfaces ensures that their local structure is only weakly perturbed by fluid motion , just as applies in passive model h @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we thereby nonperturbatively recover eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , now with @xmath90 ( see appendix [ aiii ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> so long as swimmers are extensile , the two interfacial tensions in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> are positive , and the diffusive ( @xmath62 ) and vh ( @xmath91 ) regimes both remain intact . </S>",
    "<S> the prefactor of the vh coarsening is however shifted ( possibly by a large amount ) , as is the crossover length @xmath92 .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , very different physics now arises for contractile swimmers . here </S>",
    "<S> , the interfacial tension @xmath12 in the diffusive sector is positive as usual , but the mechanical one , @xmath55 , is negative . equation still makes sense , but instead of a crossover from diffusive to vh coarsening there is a balance point @xmath93 where diffusive coarsening is negated by vh anti - coarsening . </S>",
    "<S> thus we predict that growth of domains will cease at this scale , to be replaced by a dynamic equilibrium where the diffusive shrinkage of interfacial area is balanced by its production under the action of the contractile stress . </S>",
    "<S> this stretching of interfaces can be understood as a combination of the kinematics  causing swimmers at an interface to be aligned normal to it on average  with the flow pattern around a contractile swimmer , which pulls fluid inwards axially and expels it around the equator . for a swimmer normal to the interface ( with either polarity ) </S>",
    "<S> the latter is equivalent to a negative interfacial tension ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this argument also shows why any @xmath0-dependence of @xmath2 ( unless it changes sign ) should not alter things qualitatively . negative active tension has also been suggested in @xcite by an argument that appears unrelated , in that it applies equally to contractile and extensile cases .     and box size @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> ]    _ numerical results : _ to test these ideas we have solved active model h numerically on a square lattice of size @xmath95 by using a noise - free ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) hybrid lattice boltzmann ( lb ) scheme @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the opposite is true for contractile particles which become aligned normal to the interface between phases , creating a flow pattern that stretches it ( @xmath112 ) . </S>",
    "<S> balanced by diffusion , this effect can cause the domain size @xmath10 to saturate .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is tempting to associate our prediction of arrest at a finite length scale @xmath105 in wet contractile scalar active fluids with observations of finite cluster formation , rather than full phase separation , in synthetic colloidal swimmers undergoing mips @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are two objections to this . </S>",
    "<S> first , we do not know which , if any , of these systems are contractile . </S>",
    "<S> second , most observations of cluster phases are in ` nearly dry ' systems : clusters are found within two - dimensional layers close to a momentum - absorbing boundary @xcite . nonetheless , our prediction is that arrested separation should be generic in contractile wet systems undergoing mips . </S>",
    "<S> we look forward to future experimental tests of this prediction .    _ </S>",
