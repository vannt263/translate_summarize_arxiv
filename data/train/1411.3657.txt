    "dark atoms offer an interesting possibility to solve the puzzles of dark matter searches .",
    "it turns out that even stable electrically charged particles can exist hidden in such atoms , bound by ordinary coulomb interactions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "stable particles with charge -1 are excluded due to overproduction of anomalous isotopes .",
    "however , there does nt appear such an evident contradiction for negatively doubly charged particles .",
    "there exist several types of particle models where heavy stable -2 charged species , @xmath10 , are predicted :    * ac - leptons , predicted as an extension of the standard model , based on the approach of almost - commutative geometry @xcite . *",
    "technileptons and anti - technibaryons in the framework of walking technicolor ( wtc ) @xcite .",
    "* stable `` heavy quark clusters '' @xmath11 formed by anti-@xmath12 quark of 4th generation @xcite * and , finally , stable charged clusters @xmath13 of ( anti)quarks @xmath14 of 5th family can follow from the approach , unifying spins and charges@xcite .",
    "all these models also predict corresponding + 2 charge particles .",
    "if these positively charged particles remain free in the early universe , they can recombine with ordinary electrons in anomalous helium , which is strongly constrained in terrestrial matter .",
    "therefore a cosmological scenario should provide a mechanism which suppresses anomalous helium .",
    "there are two possible mechanisms than can provide a suppression :    * the abundance of anomalous helium in the galaxy may be significant , but in terrestrial matter a recombination mechanism could suppress this abundance below experimental upper limits @xcite .",
    "the existence of a new u(1 ) gauge symmetry , causing new coulomb - like long range interactions between charged dark matter particles , is crucial for this mechanism .",
    "this leads inevitably to the existence of dark radiation in the form of hidden photons . * free positively charged particles",
    "are already suppressed in the early universe and the abundance of anomalous helium in the galaxy is negligible @xcite .",
    "these two possibilities correspond to two different cosmological scenarios of dark atoms .",
    "the first one is realized in the scenario with ac leptons , forming neutral ac atoms @xcite .",
    "the second assumes a charge asymmetry of the @xmath10 which forms the atom - like states with primordial helium @xcite .",
    "if new stable species belong to non - trivial representations of the su(2 ) electroweak group , sphaleron transitions at high temperatures can provide the relation between baryon asymmetry and excess of -2 charge stable species , as it was demonstrated in the case of wtc @xcite .    after it is formed in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , @xmath15 screens the",
    "@xmath10 charged particles in composite @xmath16 _ @xmath5",
    "_ `` atoms '' @xcite . in all the models of @xmath5",
    ", @xmath10 behaves either as a lepton or as a specific  heavy quark cluster \" with strongly suppressed hadronic interactions .",
    "the cosmological scenario of the @xmath5 universe involves only one parameter of new physics @xmath17 the mass of o@xmath18 .",
    "such a scenario is insensitive to the properties of @xmath10 ( except for its mass ) , since the main features of the @xmath5 dark atoms are determined by their nuclear interacting helium shell . in terrestrial matter",
    "such dark matter species are slowed down and can not cause significant nuclear recoil in the underground detectors , making them elusive in direct wimp search experiments ( where detection is based on nuclear recoil ) such as cdms , xenon100 and lux .",
    "the positive results of dama and possibly cresst and cogent experiments ( see @xcite for review and references ) can find in this scenario a nontrivial explanation due to a low energy radiative capture of @xmath5 by intermediate mass nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this explains the negative results of the xenon100 and lux experiments .",
    "the rate of this capture is proportional to the temperature : this leads to a suppression of this effect in cryogenic detectors , such as cdms .",
    "ohe collisions in the central part of the galaxy lead to ohe excitations , and de - excitations with pair production in e0 transitions can explain the excess of the positron - annihilation line , observed by integral in the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "one should note that the nuclear physics of ohe is in the course of development and its basic element for a successful and self - consistent ohe dark matter scenario is related to the existence of a dipole coulomb barrier , arising in the process of ohe - nucleus interaction and providing the dominance of elastic collisions of ohe with nuclei .",
    "this problem is the main open question of composite dark matter , which implies correct quantum mechanical solution @xcite .",
    "the lack of such a barrier and essential contribution of inelastic ohe - nucleus processes seem to lead to inevitable overproduction of anomalous isotopes @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a two - component dark atom scenario is also possible and can be naturally realized in the framework of a wtc model , in which both stable double charged technilepton @xmath0 , playing the role of @xmath10 , and positively double charged technibaryon @xmath3 are predicted . along with the dominant @xmath0 abundance , a much smaller excess of",
    "positively doubly charged techniparticles @xmath3 can be created .",
    "these positively charged particles are hidden in wimp - like atoms , being bound to @xmath0 . in the framework of wtc such positively charged techniparticles",
    "can be metastable , with a dominant decay channel to a pair of positively charged leptons .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that even a @xmath19 fraction of such positively charged techniparticles with a mass of 1 tev or less and a lifetime of  @xmath9 , decaying to @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 can explain the observed excess of cosmic ray positrons , being compatible with the observed gamma - ray background .",
    "the anomalous excess of high - energy positrons in cosmic rays was first observed by pamela  @xcite and was later confirmed by ams-02  @xcite .",
    "these results generated widespread interest , since the corresponding effect can not be explained by positrons of only secondary origin and requires primary positron sources , e.g. annihilations or decays of dark matter particles .",
    "recently ams-02 collaboration has reported new results on positron and electron fluxes in cosmic rays  @xcite and positron fraction  @xcite .",
    "these measurements cover the energy ranges 0.5 to 700 gev for electrons and 0.5 to 500 gev for positrons and provides important information on the origins of primary positrons in the cosmic rays .",
    "in particular , new results show , for the first time , that above @xmath23 gev the positron fraction no longer exhibits an increase with energy . the possibility to explain the cosmic positron excess by the decays of @xmath3 particles , comprising the tiny wimp - component of dark matter in the considered scenario ,",
    "was discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "here we estimate the optimal values of model parameters by achieving the best agreement with ams-02 data on cosmic positron flux and fermi - lat data on diffuse gamma - ray flux  @xcite .",
    "in the considering scenario the metastable @xmath3 particles , which together with @xmath2 forms the subdominant component of dark matter , decays as @xmath24 in principle with different branching ratios .",
    "all decay modes give directly or through cascades positrons and gamma photons .",
    "the latter are hereafter referred to as final state radiation ( fsr ) .",
    "the positron flux at the top of the earth s atmosphere can be estimated as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the local number density of @xmath3 particles with @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the number of positrons produced in a single decay ( obtained using pythia 6.4  @xcite ) , @xmath29 s@xmath30gev@xmath30 and    @xmath31    ( see  @xcite for details ) . + below @xmath32 gev behavior of positrons is affected by solar modulation .",
    "this effect can be in principle taken into account , using the force field model with two different parameters @xmath33 both for electrons and positrons , which can be easily adjusted in order to fit the data points at low energies .",
    "however , the effects of solar modulations are insignificant at the energies above @xmath34 gev and thus for our analysis we consider the positron spectrum from 20 to 500 gev .",
    "the positron background component was taken from  @xcite . +",
    "any scenario that provides positron excess is also constrained by other observational data , mainly from the data on cosmic antiprotons and gamma - radiation from our halo ( diffuse gamma - background ) and other galaxies and clusters .",
    "if dark matter does not produce antiprotons , then the diffuse gamma - ray background gives the most stringent and model - independent constraints .",
    "for the fsr photons produced by @xmath3 decays in our galaxy , the flux arriving at the earth is given by @xmath35 where we use an isothermal number density distribution @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the distances from the galactic center and the earth respectively .",
    "we obtain the averaged flux over the solid angle @xmath39 corresponding to @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "+ out of our galaxy , decays of @xmath3 homogeneously distributed over the universe should also contribute to the observed gamma - ray flux . for fsr photons",
    "this contribution can be estimated as @xmath42 where @xmath43 corresponds to the recombination epoch , @xmath44 is the current cosmological number density of @xmath3 , @xmath45 is the inverse value of the hubble parameter with @xmath46 being the age of the universe . @xmath47 and @xmath48 are respectively the current vacuum and matter relative densities .",

    "the best - fit parameter values were obtained by fitting the curve , given by eq .",
    ", to the ams-02 data points in the least squares sense . since the same parameters define the predicted gamma - ray flux in order not to contradict the fermi - lat data we extend the fitting procedure , involving several lowest points in the diffuse gamma - background spectrum above @xmath50 gev to be fit .",
    "for each choice of @xmath51 from 700 to 1400 gev we have evaluated the best - fit values of the lifetime @xmath52 and three branching ratios @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . to choose the scenario , which is most consistent with the experimental data , a @xmath56 statistical test was used .",
    "the best fit ( @xmath57 ) corresponds to the following parameter values : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "positron flux , positron fraction and gamma - ray flux in the best - fit case are shown in figs .",
    "[ posflux],[posfrac ] and [ gammabgr ] respectively .",
    "being the reflection of fundamental particle symmetry beyond the standard model , the set of stable particles  dark matter candidates  can hardly be reduced to one single species  @xcite .",
    "it makes natural to consider multi - component dark matter and one can hardly expect that various components put equal or comparable contribution into the total density .",
    "the situation with dominance of one component coexisting with some other subdominant components does nt seem too exotic in this case .",
    "dark matter solution for the puzzles of dark matter searches can involve the form of neutral @xmath5 dark atoms made of stable heavy doubly charged particles and primordial he nuclei bound by ordinary coulomb interactions .",
    "this scenario can be realized in the framework of minimal walking technicolor , in which an exact relation between the dark matter density and baryon asymmetry can be naturally obtained .",
    "strict conservation of technilepton charge together with approximate conservation of technibaryon charge results in the prediction of two types of doubly charged species with strongly unequal excess ",
    "dominant negatively charged technileptons @xmath0 and a strongly subdominant component of technibaryons @xmath1 , bound with @xmath0 in a sparse component of wimp - like dark atoms ( @xmath63 ) . direct searches for wimps",
    "put severe constraints on the presence of this component .",
    "however we have demonstrated in  @xcite that the existence of a metastable positively doubly charged techniparticle , forming this tiny subdominant wimp - like dark atom component and satisfying the direct wimp searches constraints , can play an important role in the indirect effects of dark matter .",
    "we found that decays of such positively charged constituents of wimp - like dark atoms to the leptons @xmath64 can explain the observed excess of high energy cosmic ray positrons , while being compatible with the observed gamma - ray background .",
    "these decays are naturally facilitated by gut scale interactions .",
    "the best fit of the data takes place for a mass of this doubly charged particle of 1 tev or below making it accessible in the next run of lhc .",
    "our refined analysis of the best fit description of the recent data of the ams-02 experiment , presented here , can provide a crucial test for the decaying dark atom hypothesis in the experimental searches for stable doubly charged lepton - like particles at the lhc .",
