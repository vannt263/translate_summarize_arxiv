    "blazars are probably the most extreme class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) due to their peculiar features : strong , high - frequency , flat radio emission from compact cores , often expanding at superluminal speed ( e.g. , jorstad et al .",
    "2001 ) ; irregular , rapid variability ( e.g. , boettcher 1999 ) ; strong radio and optical polarization ( e.g. , yuan et al . 2001 ) ; and a broad continuum extending to the gev energies and beyond ( e.g. , mukherjee 2001 ) .    the defining features of the blazar class can be explained within the scenario first proposed by blandford & rees ( 1978 ) .",
    "namely , radiation from these sources is likely produced in a relativistic jet of particles with bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 ; when the jet is observed at small angle , the so - called `` beaming '' effect is responsible for most of the above features .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars commonly presents a double peak structure ( fossati et al .",
    "the first peak ( usually located between the infrared and the uv band ) is interpreted as synchrotron emission from the relativistic electrons in the jet .",
    "the same electron population can inverse compton scatter the synchrotron produced photons ( synchrotron self compton ) and photons from the disc or the emission line regions ( external compton ) to produce high energy radiation peaking in the x - ray to @xmath7-ray region ( ghisellini 1999 ) .    among the blazar class ,",
    "two subclasses can be identified ( see urry & padovani 1995 ) . the first one is constituted by the flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) .",
    "these are very powerful sources ( exceeding in some cases @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 ) which show strong and broad emission lines .",
    "to the second one belong the bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) , less luminous , and lacking emission lines with equivalent width @xmath10 ",
    ".    due to the strong and relativistically amplified emission from the jet , the thermal contribution from the accretion disc to the total luminosity can not be in general directly observed in blazars .",
    "for this reason the relation between disc and jet is still uncertain for this class of sources ( see celotti , padovani & ghisellini 1997 and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we try to disentangle the blazar disc and jet components in the optical / uv band .",
    "we do this by evaluating masses and accretion rates for a sample of blazars , using these parameters to compute an accretion disc emission model . to this order ,",
    "information on the accretion disc continuum is required , but that is generally swamped by the beamed jet emission .",
    "therefore , we use the broad line region ( blr ) luminosity and relate it to the thermal emission .",
    "thus , we are led to take in account in our analysis only fsrq sources , which show strong emission lines ( although some bl lacs show some emission lines , these sources are thought to have a very weak , if any , accretion disc component ; e.g. , cavaliere & delia 2002 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the sample from which we selected the sources to be studied . in section 3",
    "we discuss the method used to evaluate the thermal contribution of the selected sources . in section 4",
    "we test this method on a sample of radio - quiet quasars . in section 5",
    "we compute the thermal spectrum for the sources in our sample and we subtract it from the measured spectra , to disentangle the accretion disc emission from the synchrotron one . in section 6",
    "we evaluate and compare the total thermal and jet powers . in section 7",
    "we discuss our results while section 8 summarizes our conclusions . throughout this paper the values @xmath11 km",
    "s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 and @xmath12 have been adopted and spectral indices are written as @xmath13 .",
    "the fsrq selected for our analysis belong to the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ) .",
    "the dxrbs has been built by cross - correlating all the serendipitous x - ray sources in the rosat database wgacat ( first revision : white , giommi & angelini 1995 ) with a number of radio catalogs ( see perlman et al .",
    "1998 and landt et al .",
    "2001 for details ) .    to select blazar candidates among all the radio sources a spectral index cut @xmath14 was adopted .",
    "this is a very efficient way to find blazars because it selects all fsrq ( separated by definition from the steep spectrum radio quasars at @xmath15 ) , basically all bl lacs , and excludes almost all radio galaxies .",
    "dxrbs is currently the faintest and largest flat - spectrum radio sample with nearly complete ( @xmath16 per cent ) identification , reaching @xmath17 mjy at 5 ghz , i.e. , radio fluxes @xmath18 times fainter than previously published blazar samples . as of july 2002 ,",
    "the dxrbs includes 198 fsrq ; of these , we choose the 136 sources for which the blr luminosity , @xmath19 , was available ( landt et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "among these , 113 are newly identified sources with available optical spectra .",
    "the remaining 23 fsrq were previously known , and for these sources we do not have optical or uv spectra , although we have blr fluxes .",
    "therefore , we calculate mass , accretion rate and total thermal power for all sources ( see sect . 3 and 6 ) , while for the former ones we also disentangle the luminosity components in the optical band ( see section 5 ) .    the classification and spectra of most of the sources used in this paper are given in perlman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and landt et al .",
    "the remaining sources will be included in future dxrbs papers , currently in preparation .",
    "line parameters ( fluxes and widths ) will be presented by landt et al .",
    ", in preparation .",
    "in order to reproduce the thermal contribution to the total emission of blazars we need an accretion disc model . these models have basically two input parameters , the mass of the central black hole and the accretion rate .",
    "we use the model first proposed by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , which involves a geometrically thin , optically thick steady accretion disc ( pringle 1981 ; czerny & elvis 1987 ) .",
    "the disc spectrum is the following :    @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gravitational radius , @xmath22 is the radius of the innermost stable orbit and @xmath23 is the maximum distance from the central black hole at which the spectrum is computed .",
    "finally , @xmath24 is the surface temperature of the accretion disc and is given by :    @xmath25^{1/4},\\eqno(2)\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the stefan constant and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the mass of the central black hole and the accretion rate , respectively .    in principle",
    ", one can evaluate @xmath27 using the formula    @xmath29 once the distance @xmath30 and the velocity @xmath31 of a body in the gravitational field of the black hole are known . here",
    "@xmath32 for a body in free - fall and @xmath33 for an orbiting body .",
    "while the velocity of the gas in the blr can be evaluated quite easily from observed spectra using the line widths , the determination of the distance @xmath30 is not straightforward .",
    "basically , two different methods can be used ( see wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) .",
    "the first one is indirect and relies on photoionization theory ( e.g. , netzer 1990 ) by using the definition of the ionization parameter @xmath34 ( proportional to the flux of ionizing photons per electron ) :    @xmath35 where    @xmath36 is the number of ionizing photons per unit of time and @xmath37 is the electronic density in the shell of the blr at distance @xmath30 from the center . the second method , more direct , takes advantage of the reverberation - mapping technique ( e.g. , peterson 1993 ) .",
    "this allows one to evaluate the radius of the blr by measuring the time lags between variations in the broad emission lines and the ionizing continuum .",
    "we can see that in order to evaluate @xmath30 from eq .",
    "( 4 ) we need to know @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the latter has been calculated as follows .",
    "we assume for our sources an average optical to x - ray effective spectral index @xmath40 , equal to that measured by laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the 19 radio - quiet quasars from the bright quasar survey .",
    "we then substitute in eq .",
    "( 5 ) @xmath41 and calculate @xmath42 for every single object using the equation :    @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the power of the ionizing continuum and @xmath45 is the blr covering factor , which we assume to be @xmath46 per cent ( see next subsection ) .",
    "the second quantity needed , @xmath38 , varies from line to line , due to the complex structure of the blr .",
    "this parameter can be estimated from eq .",
    "( 4 ) if the distance of the clouds emitting a particular line is known .",
    "this is available for a sizeable sample of source for h@xmath47 ( e.g. , wandel et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) since this line is easy to observe in low - redshift , and better studied , agn . by comparing the radius measured with the reverberation mapping techniques with that evaluated with the photoionization model for 18 sources we derive @xmath48 @xmath49 . however",
    ", our sample has an average redshift @xmath50 , which means that only a relatively small number of sources ( 32 ) has @xmath51 information .",
    "we then need an estimate of @xmath38 for some lines in the uv band , which unfortunately have not been studied exhaustively yet .",
    "fromerth and melia ( 2000 ) have recently published the distances of the c iv line region for five agn , evaluated using the reverberation mapping technique .",
    "we can then use these values and the h@xmath47 distances for the same objects ( wandel et al .",
    "1999 ) to evaluate @xmath52 as follows :    @xmath53    we perform this calculation for all the five objects and we then compute an average to obtain @xmath54 @xmath49 .",
    "with this value we can evaluate @xmath55 for 40 more objects ( the ones showing the c iv line ) .    from the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) values and from eq .",
    "( 3 ) we calculate the masses for these 72 objects , using @xmath56 and @xmath57 fwhm , which represents a reasonable choice for radio - loud quasars , as suggested by mclure and dunlop ( 2001 ) . in a handful of cases",
    "( and only for h@xmath47 ) we found a relatively strong narrow component associated with the line which , if not subtracted , would have given a spuriously low value for the fwhm ( and therefore the mass ) .",
    "in those cases the fwhm values we are using refer to the broad component of the lines . the relation between the derived mass and the ionizing power l@xmath58",
    "is plotted in figure [ mass_lion ] .",
    "we find a very strong correlation ( @xmath59 per cent ) between the two quantities , with @xmath60 , and then use this correlation to evaluate the masses for the 64 fsrq without h@xmath47 or c iv information .",
    "note that such a dependence is not unexpected : in our sample we find no correlation between fwhm and l@xmath58 and therefore , since we assume @xmath61 , we will obtain @xmath62 .",
    "the second parameter needed to compute any accretion disc model is the accretion rate of mass onto the central black hole ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this quantity is calculated using the following relation :    @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the efficiency parameter . in the following",
    "we assume that the black holes in the center of our fsrq are rapidly rotating , so that we choose @xmath65 ( malkan 1982 ) .",
    "we finally evaluate the eddington ratio for all the 136 sources for which mass and accretion rate have been calculated :    @xmath66 where @xmath28 is expressed in @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "table 1 gives masses , accretion rates , and eddington ratios for all our fsrq .",
    "note that masses span the range @xmath69 , with @xmath70 , while accretion rates cover the range @xmath71 , with @xmath72 .",
    "* table 1 .",
    "masses , accretion rates , eddington ratios and luminosities *    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,^,>,^,>,^ \" , ]     we now use the luminosity values to perform correlations between powers .",
    "two possible complications should be kept in mind : first , when correlating luminosities one has to be particularly careful to remove the ( generally ) common redshift dependence which can introduce spurious correlations .",
    "the proper way of dealing with the problem is to examine the correlations between luminosities excluding the dependence on redshift , i.e. , via a partial correlation analysis ( see kendall & stuart 1979 ; anderson 1984 ) ; second , the three frequency ranges sample different redshifts , as shown in tab . 3 , and therefore the comparison is subject to possible evolutionary effects .",
    "we have correlated the thermal power @xmath73 with the non - thermal one , @xmath74 , starting from the @xmath75 hz range , which includes the largest number of sources .",
    "we assume that two components make up the optical / uv emission in our sources , a thermal one related to the accretion disc , and a non - thermal one related to the jet .",
    "the former has then been derived by subtracting the thermal from the total power , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "[ lth_lnt ] shows that the two quantities are strongly correlated ( @xmath77 per cent , @xmath78 ) .",
    "this is true even when the common redshift dependence is subtracted off .",
    "note that the observed strong correlation can not be due to the fact that the two powers are not strictly independent , as that would result in an _ anti - correlation _ between the two quantities .",
    "both powers are also strongly correlated with optical power @xmath79 ( defined at 5,000  ) but , again , their mutual correlation remains highly significant ( @xmath80 per cent ) even when this common dependence is taken into account .",
    "( we note that the @xmath81 correlation is expected , given that @xmath82 . )",
    "the fact that @xmath83 suggests that the @xmath84 ratio depends on luminosity .",
    "indeed , we find a strong anti - correlation between @xmath84 and @xmath74 ( but not @xmath73 ) , i.e. , the stronger the non - thermal power , the lower the thermal fraction , with this ratio approaching unity at the low end of our luminosity range ( see fig . [ lth_lnt ] ) .",
    "this could indicate that only in less powerful ( possibly less beamed ? ) sources the thermal component manages to rival with the non - thermal one .",
    "the fact that weak - lined blazars , which are normally less powerful than strong - lined ones , have a very weak , if any , thermal component , and therefore lie significantly off the correlation , would then suggest a dichotomy between the two classes .    as regards the other two bands , we also find a slope less than 1 for the correlation between the two powers , namely @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 hz range and the @xmath88 hz range respectively . in both cases",
    "the significance of the @xmath89 correlation is very high ( @xmath90 and 99.7 per cent ) once the redshift dependence is subtracted off but becomes low ( @xmath91 and 92 per cent ) once the effect of the optical power is also considered .",
    "in the last section we evaluated the thermal component in the optical / uv band , subtracted it from the total power and computed the ratio @xmath92 of monochromatic luminosities for some fixed frequencies .",
    "this led us to recognize that our sources optical / uv spectra are almost all dominated by non - thermal emission .",
    "however , we still do not know which of the two outputs dominates the _ total _ power .",
    "this is because : 1 ) the non - thermal emission is amplified by the beaming effect ; 2 ) the total radiative power is only a fraction of the total power in the jet ; 3 ) the peak of the thermal luminosity ( located in the uv - soft x - ray band ) does not fall in the region covered by the available spectra , and thus thermal emission may overcome the non - thermal one ( which is usually described by @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) at higher frequencies .    for this reason we want to compare directly the total powers from the disc and jet ; in the following these powers are referred to as @xmath95 and @xmath96 , with the first letter of each subscript in upper case , to indicate that these quantities are powers integrated over the whole spectral range and not luminosities per unit of frequency as in the previous section .",
    "@xmath95 can be easily calculated by simple integration over the thermal spectra previously computed and is also basically equal to the ionizing power @xmath44 .",
    "the latter one is not easy to evaluate , however , because of beaming effects .",
    "we follow willott et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and define the time - averaged jet power as the total energy transported from the central engine by both jets divided by the age of the radio source .",
    "willott et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have derived this relationship to evaluate the jet power from the monochromatic luminosity at 151 mhz ,    @xmath97 where @xmath98 is in units of @xmath99 w hz@xmath9 sr@xmath9 and @xmath100 is a factor which takes into account all the uncertainties of the calculation and lies in the range @xmath101 . in particular , these uncertainties reside in : ( i ) the volume filling factor of the synchrotron emitting material ; ( ii ) the contribution to the energy budget from protons ; ( iii ) the dimension of the reservoir of mildly relativistic electrons ; ( iv ) the departure from the minimum - energy condition in the lobe material . relation ( 10 ) holds if @xmath98 is the unbeamed radio luminosity , that is , the extended component of the emission at 151 mhz . as we only have measurements for the radio luminosity at 5 ghz , to estimate the jet power we need to extrapolate to 151 mhz .",
    "the unbeamed power at 151 mhz can be expressed as follows :    @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the spectral index of the unbeamed component , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the 5 ghz powers of the beamed and unbeamed component , respectively , and @xmath106 is the core dominance parameter at 5 ghz .",
    "we do not have @xmath106 values for all our sources .",
    "however , as the radio spectral index is a beaming indicator , we expect a relation to hold between @xmath106 and @xmath107 . to derive this relation we use all fsrq and ssrq ( steep spectrum radio quasars ) in the dxrbs database for which both @xmath106 and @xmath107 are available ( 65 sources ) . the correlation we find is the following :    @xmath108 significant at the @xmath109 per cent level . as discussed in landt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the dxrbs core - dominance parameters , based on australia telescope compact array ( atca ) data , are actually upper limits .",
    "indeed , the same correlation for a ( highly inhomogeneous ) set of 49 radio - loud quasars with higher resolution radio data in the multiwavelength agn catalog of padovani , giommi & fiore ( 1997 ) yields a a best - fit correlation with a slope of @xmath110 , consistent within the errors with ours , but with a lower intercept value .",
    "the best - fit value at @xmath111 , the mean for the dxrbs sample , is in fact a factor @xmath112 smaller . in the following",
    "we then adopt the relation given by eq .",
    "( 12 ) but with an intercept of 0.24 , so that our slope comes from an homogeneous set of data .",
    "note that this revised correlation gives a dividing value between core - dominated ( @xmath113 ) and lobe - dominated ( @xmath114 ) sources of @xmath115 , not too far from the generally adopted distinction between fsrq and ssrq ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath116 , a typical value for the radio spectral index of the fanaroff - riley ii ( fr ii ) radio galaxies , and since @xmath117 , we can evaluate @xmath118 .",
    "namely :    @xmath119    figure [ lth_ljet_20 ] plots @xmath95 vs. @xmath96 , with @xmath96 calculated using @xmath120 in eq .",
    "we find that the two powers are correlated , albeit with a large scatter .",
    "namely , @xmath121 ( the intercept becomes 7.80 if @xmath122 ) , @xmath123 , @xmath77 per cent .",
    "the correlation still holds if the common redshift dependence is subtracted off ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 per cent ) .",
    "figure [ disk_jet_ratio ] shows the distribution of the thermal to jet power , @xmath126 , for our sample using @xmath120 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) ( bottom axis ) and @xmath122 ( top axis ) .",
    "the mean value for the two cases are , respectively , @xmath127 and @xmath128 or @xmath129 and 20 .    as a check of our method for evaluating the bolometric thermal output from the accretion disc we have used another relation in willott et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , namely @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the power of the  narrow line .",
    "this is based on assuming an equivalent width of 10   for , which allows an estimate of the blue luminosity , which is then converted to bolometric , under the assumption that the bolometric output is dominated by the the accretion disc emission .",
    "we have estimated @xmath131 for our sources using the correlation with @xmath98 found by willott et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for fr ii radio sources .",
    "we find that the thermal bolometric luminosity evaluated from the relations of willott et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , @xmath132 , is very well correlated ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 per cent ) with that derived with our method , @xmath135 , albeit with a very large scatter , with a mean ordinary least - squares ( ols ) slope ( isobe et al .",

    "this comparison , nevertheless , provides independent evidence that the method we use to compute the bolometric thermal power is reliable .",

    "we studied the correlation matrix of @xmath149 plus redshift to assess which ones are the strongest correlations .",

    "the @xmath156 ratio anti - correlates strongly with @xmath145 and @xmath147 , but the latter correlation appears to be induced by the former .    to conclude , we now discuss how our results would change for different choices of covering factor and black hole . if a covering factor of @xmath157 per cent instead of @xmath158 per cent is assumed all the computed thermal powers decrease roughly by a factor @xmath159 .",
    "the dominance of the non - thermal emission in the optical / uv would become even stronger , as the thermal component would only make up @xmath160 per cent of the power",
    ". the average ratio between the total disc and the jet power would be @xmath161 ( @xmath160 ) for @xmath120 ( @xmath122 ) . in this case ,",
    "our thermal powers would be on average a factor @xmath162 below those estimated using the willott et al . correlations . assuming",
    "a non - rotating black hole would increase the accretion rates by a factor @xmath163 , as the efficiency goes down but the ionizing power is fixed by the blr power ( see eq .",
    "the shape of the spectrum also changes because the radius of the last stable orbit increases . the combination of these two effects result in a thermal spectrum which is not too different from that of a rotating black hole , with a slight shift towards lower frequencies and a slightly higher normalization .",
    "three main results have come out of this work .",
    "we discuss them now in turn .",
    "it has long been thought that any thermal emission related to accretion in the optical / uv spectra of fsrq had to be relatively weak , or rather swamped by the non - thermal emission from the jet ( although exceptions exist , e.g. , 3c 273 ) .",
    "we have quantified this in a systematic , albeit model - dependent way , by deriving an accretion disc spectrum and by then comparing it to the observed rest - frame optical / uv spectra of more than 100 fsrq from the dxrbs .",
    "the determination of the mass and accretion rate for our sources , which are required parameters of the model , should be relatively robust .",
    "the former is based on the virial theorem , by now widely used , normalized on the results of reverberation mapping campaigns .",
    "( even the mass determinations based on c iv agree very well with a recent calibration published by vestergaard ( 2002 ) . )",
    "the latter has been derived from the blr power and the only uncertainty there is the covering factor , which we think should be constrained within a factor @xmath159 .",
    "moreover , the reliability of our method has been tested by comparing the predictions of the model with the observed optical / uv spectra of a sample of radio - quiet quasars , under the assumption that in this case most of the emission should be due to the disc .",
    "reassuringly , the predictions were within a factor of two from the observations .",
    "we have found that the optical / uv emission of fsrq is dominated by a non - thermal component , which makes up @xmath164 per cent of the total power . only in a small fraction ( @xmath165 per cent ) of the objects",
    "does the thermal component dominates .",
    "this is consistent with the relatively steep optical / uv slopes of dxrbs fsrq ( @xmath166 ; landt et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in all three rest - frame bands we have used there is evidence that the thermal fraction is higher at lower non - thermal powers , which might suggest that only in less powerful , and therefore possibly less beamed , sources the thermal component manages to rival with the non - thermal one .",
    "whiting , webster & francis ( 2001 ) have fitted the optical and near - infrared seds of @xmath167 fsrq from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample .",
    "they assessed the relevance of thermal and non - thermal components by fitting a blue power law ( fixed to @xmath168 ) and optical synchrotron emission .",
    "the ratio of the synchrotron and power - law components at a rest - frame wavelength of @xmath169   was found to span nearly four orders of magnitude .",
    "the distribution was strongly peaked , however , at ratios @xmath170 , suggesting a dominance of non - thermal emission in the optical band of these sources , in agreement with our results obtained with an independent method .",
    "it has been suggested in the literature that radio - loud quasars require massive black holes .",
    "laor ( 2000 ) pointed out that nearly all palomar - green ( pg ) quasars with @xmath171 are radio - loud , while quasars with @xmath172 are practically all radio - quiet .",
    "this has been recently taken up by boroson ( 2002 ) , who has suggested a scheme to explain the radio - loud / radio - quiet dichotomy based on mass and eddington ratio .",
    "ho ( 2002 ) , however , by using a sample which spanned a large range of activity , did not confirm the trend found by laor ( 2000 ) .",
    "lacy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also found a dependence of black hole mass on the radio - loudness parameter @xmath173 ( equivalent to our @xmath145 ) with most radio - loud ( @xmath174 ) sources having @xmath175 , but with the radio - quiet ones extending to @xmath176 .",
    "about 25 per cent of our sources , which are all strongly radio - loud ( @xmath177 , well above the typically assumed dividing line of 0.2 ) , have @xmath178 .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the objects whose mass has been derived from @xmath51 , for comparison with previous studies , this fraction gets much higher .",
    "the mean mass in this case is @xmath179 ( to be compared with @xmath70 for the whole sample ) and now @xmath180 per cent of our objects have estimated black hole masses below @xmath181 . keeping in mind the danger of comparing results for samples selected with different criteria ,",
    "the mass range covered by our radio - loud quasars is not very different from that of the radio - quiet quasars in laor ( 2000 ) .",
    "if the motion of emission - line gas is confined predominantly to a disc perpendicular to the radio axis then in core - dominated ( flat - spectrum ) sources , like ours , we might be biased towards low fwhm values ( wills & browne 1986 ) and , therefore , we might be underestimating the black hole masses .",
    "although this could have some effect on our results , we believe it can not be major ( see also oshlack et al .",
    "first , within dxrbs we do not find any correlation between fwhm(@xmath51 ) ( and also fwhm(c iv ) ) and @xmath182 , although the relative number of ssrq in dxrbs is , by construction , small ( @xmath183 per cent and @xmath184 per cent for sources with @xmath51 and c iv respectively ) , as we have a cut at @xmath185 .",
    "we also do not find any correlation between atca core - dominance parameter and fwhm(@xmath51 ) ( 20 sources ) or fwhm(c iv ) ( 27 sources ) .",
    "second , gu , cao & jiang ( 2001 ) have assembled fwhm(@xmath51 ) for 86 radio sources , selected from the 1 jy , s4 , and s5 catalogs , including 55 fsrq and 31 ssrq .",
    "table 2 in oshlack et al .",
    "( 2002 ) shows that the ratio of the mean ( median ) fwhm(@xmath51 ) for ssrq and fsrq is @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) , which would imply a `` correction '' factor for our @xmath51 masses @xmath162 ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "this means that @xmath189 per cent of our low - redshift objects would still have estimated black hole masses below @xmath181 . as discussed in sect .",
    "4 , a factor of 2 increase in black hole mass has in any case a small effect on our other results .",
    "oshlack et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have estimated black hole masses for 39 sources belonging to the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample , also finding that a significant fraction of the radio quasars in their sample have relatively small masses .",
    "both studies are based on complete , radio - selected samples so the failure of some previous studies to find radio - loud quasars with small masses is likely due to a selection effect .",
    "oshlack et al .",
    "( 2002 ) comment on the fact that there is a strong correlation between mass and optical / uv luminosity , shown for our sample in fig .",
    "[ mass_lion ] , a consequence of using ionizing power to estimate the blr radius .",
    "this implies that if a sample is biased against selecting low optical luminosity , radio - loud quasars , as seems to be the case for the pg sample , it will miss the low - mass radio - loud sources .",
    "dxrbs is almost completely identified and we find a large range of optical powers in our quasar sample .",
    "contrary to what found by laor ( 2000 ) , we find an anti - correlation between mass and @xmath145 , in the sense that the most radio - loud sources have also the smaller masses .",
    "again , this is partly induced by the correlations between mass and ionizing ( optical ) power and @xmath145 and optical power ( see also oshlack et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the relationship between black hole mass and radio power has also been recently addressed in the literature .",
    "since all our sources have a radio flat - spectrum and are therefore heavily affected by relativistic beaming , we can not comment on this point .",
    "even more interesting than the non - thermal / thermal ratio in the optical / uv band is the relationship between integrated disc and jet emission .",
    "the former is easily derived assuming that the ionizing photons originate in the accretion disc and therefore depends on the blr luminosity and the covering factor .",
    "note that the total disc emission is independent of the mass .",
    "an estimate of the total jet power is more difficult to obtain , because it depends on many astrophysical parameters , some of which are at present not well constrained .",
    "we have then relied on the theoretical relationship obtained by willott et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which links jet power to the extended radio emission at 151 mhz , derived for our sources from their 5 ghz radio power and radio spectral index .",
    "this relationship has a built - in uncertainty @xmath190 , due to various uncertainties in the model assumptions .",
    "we compared the results of both estimates to previous results obtained using independent methods , with relatively good agreement .",
    "in particular , an application of our method to estimate jet power to the 34 quasars studied by celotti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using an ssc model favours large values of @xmath100 and would actually suggest a nominal value @xmath191 .",
    "we have found that @xmath192 and that , on average , @xmath193 ( or 20 if @xmath122 ) .",
    "the dispersion around the average is relatively large , about a factor of 4 ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "this could simply reflect the uncertainties of our method or might indicate a dependence of this ratio on some parameter .",
    "one of the strongest correlations we find is between @xmath156 and the optical - to - radio flux ratio , which we parametrize using @xmath145 .",
    "this correlation might be expected given that @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "( we note however that we have shown that @xmath79 is dominated by the non - thermal component , while @xmath96 depends by construction on the extended radio emission , while our sources are mostly core - dominated . )",
    "however , it is not induced by other correlations and therefore might be used to estimate the total disc to jet power ratio as a function of radio - loudness .",
    "[ disk_jet_aro ] plots @xmath156 ( using @xmath120 in eq .",
    "10 ) vs. @xmath145 for our sources .",
    "the best fit is @xmath197 .",
    "( the intercept value becomes 3.45 if @xmath122 is used instead . ) assuming that this relationship can be extrapolated to the radio - quiet regime , we get @xmath198 for @xmath199 , a value typical for radio - quiet agn .",
    "( if @xmath122 we get instead @xmath200 . )",
    "we checked this extrapolation by estimating the jet power for the radio - quiet ( pg ) quasars used in sect . 4 to test our accretion disc model . namely , we derived the extended radio flux at 5 ghz for the sources in tab . 2 by subtracting the core from the total fluxes given in kellermann et al .",
    "only the six sources for which this difference was larger than the quoted noise summed in quadrature ( 0.09 mjy ) were considered .",
    "the flux was then extrapolated at 151 mhz assuming a radio spectral index of 0.8 and then eq .",
    "( 10 ) was used to estimate the jet power .",
    "the radio - quiet quasars fall on the extrapolation of the relation obtained for the fsrq in the @xmath201 plane .",
    "this supports the use of @xmath145 to estimate the disc to jet power ratios in all broad - line agn and suggests that the disc to jet power ratio in radio - quiet agn is a few hundred times larger than in radio - loud agn .",
    "the disc power for the two classes , at least for the sources discussed in this paper , is comparable , so what is changing is obviously jet power .",
    "note that in both classes of sources the contribution of the host galaxy to the optical emission ( and therefore to @xmath145 ) is negligible .",
    "the dxrbs fsrq are typically at @xmath202 , where the strong nuclear luminosity evolution should make the agn dwarf the host galaxy .",
    "as regards the pg quasars , these were selected on the basis of being `` point - like '' .",
    "detailed imaging studies ( e.g. , mcleod & mcleod 2001 ) have indeed confirmed that the ratio of host to nuclear light is @xmath203 in the near - infrared band , and therefore even smaller in the optical .",
    "we now want to compare our results with previous works also aimed at studying the relation between thermal and jet power in radio - loud sources .",
    "rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) found a very strong correlation , covering four orders of magnitude , between the jet kinetic power and narrow line region luminosity in radio - loud objects .",
    "since the power of the narrow line region is proportional to the thermal power , this translates in a correlation between the latter and the jet power , similar to ours .",
    "the slope of our correlation is close to that of rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) , and their average ratio between thermal and jet power is close to unity ( we find an average value of @xmath204 , for @xmath120 ) , even if their computation of the kinetic power is carried out in a different way , i.e. , by invoking equipartition between the magnetic field and the electron energy densities in the jets .",
    "celotti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found a weak ( 95.8 per cent ) correlation between the jet kinetic energy and the power of the broad line region for an inhomogeneous sample of radio - loud sources composed of steep spectrum radio quasars , fsrq , and bl lacertae objects , with the thermal and jet powers of the same order of magnitude .",
    "willott et al . ( 1999 ) evaluated the relation between the thermal and non - thermal power for a very large sample of fr ii radio sources .",
    "we have adopted their method to estimate jet power but they evaluated the thermal power from the  line luminosity .",
    "they found an average thermal to jet power ratio @xmath205 for @xmath120 depending on the cosmology adopted ( @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively ) and @xmath208 for @xmath122 .",
    "the values we find for our fsrq sample are @xmath3 and @xmath209 ( see also fig .",
    "[ disk_jet_ratio ] ) , consistent within a factor of two .",
    "thus , we can conclude that our blazars behave as their parent population , the fr ii radio galaxies , and this is definitely in favour of unified scheme models ( scheuer 1987 ; barthel 1989 ; antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "maraschi & tavecchio ( 2002 ) estimated the jet power for 11 fsrq using synchrotron inverse - compton fits to multiwavelength data and the accretion power for the same objects using the optical - uv bump in their data or the blr luminosity when the data did not feature such a bump . in agreement with celotti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , they found that the two powers are of the same order of magnitude .      the leading model to explain jet production is the blandford & znajek ( 1977 ; bz ) mechanism , that involves the electrodynamic extraction of rotational energy from a spinning black hole ( i.e. , a kerr hole ) . the bz power scales as @xmath210 @xmath211 being the radius of the kerr hole and @xmath212 being the magnetic field threaded to the hole ( see also cavaliere & delia 2002 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "however , the bz mechanism has been proven to be insufficient to achieve the luminosities of the most powerful fsrq due to the magnetic field , which is limited by the radiation pressure in the accretion disk .",
    "ghosh & abramowicz ( 1997 ) , for example , have shown that in a radiation pressure dominated disk , the _ maximum _ value of the electromagnetic energy that can be extracted from the kerr hole is @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the kerr hole mass in units of @xmath215 and the parameter @xmath216 describes the rotation of the hole ( @xmath33 for a maximally spinning hole and @xmath217 for a non - rotating black hole ) .",
    "we can see from eq .",
    "( 15 ) that the jet power in our most luminous fsrq , which can reach almost @xmath218 erg s@xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ lth_ljet_20 ] ) , can not be explained using the bz mechanism to extract energy from the kerr hole , even assuming the highest mass we have estimated for our sources @xmath219 ( see also maraschi & tavecchio 2002 ) . for our sample we can calculate @xmath220 using eq .",
    "( 15 ) and the black hole masses we evaluated and compare it with the jet power computed from eq .",
    "( 10 ) with @xmath120 .",
    "we find that , while @xmath221 , @xmath222 , i.e. , a factor @xmath159 smaller .",
    "thus , on average , even the _ maximum _ kerr hole luminosity produced via the bz mechanism is not able to explain the estimated @xmath96 , although in @xmath183 per cent of our objects @xmath223 is greater than @xmath96 .",
    "note that for a value of @xmath122 we get @xmath224 , 8 times _ smaller _ than @xmath223 , with @xmath223 greater than @xmath96 for @xmath225 per cent of the objects .",
    "but in this case our jet power estimates would be in gross disagreement with previous derivations .",
    "the point remains , however , that the difference we find between jet and maximum bz power is smaller than that found , for example , by maraschi & tavecchio ( 2002 ; see their fig .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that dxrbs is sampling fsrq of lower power than the `` classical '' , high - power ones normally studied .    to explain the jet power in fsrq two variants of the bz process has been proposed .",
    "the first one invokes the electrodynamic extraction of rotational energy from the accretion disk too ( blandford & payne 1982 ) .",
    "this basically corresponds to using a larger value for @xmath211 in eq .",
    "the second variant argues for strong magnetic fields in the plunging orbit region , where relativistic effects could enhance such fields to higher values than those fixed by the radiation pressure in the accretion disk ( e.g. , meier 1999 ) .",
    "further investigations are definitely needed in order to shed more light on the bz process and on its role in the production of blazar jets .",
    "we have presented an indirect approach to investigate the relationship between accretion disc and jet in strong - lined blazars . as the luminosity produced from the accretion disc in the optical / uv band",
    "can not be observed directly because of the beamed jet emission , we have estimated the disc component using an accretion disc model for 136 flat - spectrum radio quasars .",
    "these sources belong to the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ) and therefore represent a well - defined , almost completely identified sample .",
    "the model requires an estimate of the mass and accretion rate for each source .",
    "these have been derived from broad line widths , normalizing our blr distances to the results of reverberation mapping campaigns , and ionizing powers , the latter derived from the blr power , which we derive from the emission line fluxes , mostly from our own spectra .",
    "our estimate of the thermal component has been tested for a sample of radio - quiet quasars , for which the thermal component should dominate .",
    "indeed , the observed powers at the predicted peak of the thermal emission were within a factor less than two from those computed with our method .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the application of our method to the observed spectra of our sources has shown that non - thermal emission dominates the ( rest - frame ) optical / uv band of strong - lined blazars , accounting on average for @xmath164 per cent of the power . only a small fraction ( @xmath226 per cent ) of our flat - spectrum radio quasars shows a dominance of thermal emission in their optical / uv spectra .",
    "2 .   the ratio between _ integrated _ disc and jet power is , on average , @xmath227 , possibly reaching typical values as high as 20 .",
    "this large range is due to uncertainties in the assumptions that have gone into the relation we have used to estimate jet power from extended radio power , derived by willott et al .",
    "nevertheless , a comparison with results from an ssc - based method favours low values for this ratio .",
    "we have used the correlation between disc - to - jet power ratio and optical - to - radio flux ratio to estimate that the former parameter is a few hundred times larger in radio - quiet agn than it is in radio - loud agn .",
    "this is confirmed by estimating the jet power for a handful of radio - quiet quasars .",
    "a by - product of our study is an estimate of black hole masses for radio quasars belonging to a well - defined sample .",
    "contrary to some previous studies , we have found that a sizeable fraction of our sample ( @xmath228 per cent ; 50 per cent of the @xmath51 sample ) has a relatively small ( @xmath229 ) mass , which argues that radio - loud sources do not require particularly massive black holes .",
    "eddington ratios are typically @xmath230 .",
    "we have calculated the maximum power that can be extracted from a rotating black - hole in our sources according to the blandford - znajek mechanism , making use of our mass estimates .",
    "if the jet power is as high as inferred by a comparison with independent methods , it can be explained by the blandford - znajek process only in a minority ( @xmath228 per cent ) of our sources .",
