    "further studies @xcite have updated this framework with new constraints on the population of ionizing sources and the distribution and properties of igm absorbers . however , all of these studies treated the ionizing background ( and its sources and sinks ) as _ uniform _ components , which is a reasonable approximation for the hbackground ( at least at low and moderate redshifts ; @xcite ) but is a poor approximation when bright , rare sources dominate the emissivity ( as is the case for quasars and the heionizing background ) .",

    "must be iterated over the entire redshift range until convergence .",
    "the result of this cosmological radiative transfer model as presented in this section will be referred to as the `` uniform '' background model in the rest of the paper .",

    "predicts the amount of hefrom the original model ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) . for frequencies near @xmath40 ,",
    "the opacity is unaffected because these high @xmath28 systems are still optically thick due to habsorption .",
    "however , for @xmath70 , absorbers with @xmath71@xmath72 @xmath64 start to become optically thin due to their relative lack of he .",
    "fortunately , the total ionization rate only changes slightly because the range of affected column densities is small and the vast majority of ionizations occur at lower frequencies ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "@xcite applied a similar method to fit the absorber structure that considers the average @xmath74 within absorbers instead of the external  optically - thin \" @xmath74 .",
    "while their method provides a better fit to the numerical models at @xmath69 @xmath64 , it differs from the @xcite model only in the details for the more important @xmath75 ( @xmath76 @xmath64 ) absorbers .",
    "this is an example of one of the systematic uncertainties in our procedure : these models for @xmath48 must assume physical characteristics for the absorbers ( densities , temperatures , and geometry , for example ) that are both uncertain and simplifications of the true igm physics .",
    "for concreteness , the numerical absorber model from @xcite assumes uniform density semi - infinite slabs with a thickness determined by the local jeans length ( at @xmath77  k ) in photoionization equilibrium with both an external radiation background and internal recombination processes .",
    "recombinations of heto the ground state of hewill produce ionizing continuum radiation .",
    "although the recombination rate in a uniform density medium can easily be estimated from ionization equilibrium , the real universe requires a more detailed approach for two reasons .",
    "first , density inhomogeneities in the igm substantially boost the recombination rate .",
    "we can model this by integrating over the hcolumn density distribution of the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "second , recombination photons produced inside optically thick absorbers will not escape to affect the igm .",
    "we model the recombination emissivity of igm absorbers with a numerical fit to the radiative transfer models of @xcite .",
    "the emergent specific intensity from an absorber with hecolumn density @xmath37 can be approximated by @xmath78 where the second factor is the fraction of ionizations to the ground state and the local ionization rate is @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 @xmath64 is the approximate threshold hecolumn density above which the emission becomes saturated by absorption within the absorber itself ( the decline at larger columns is approximated by the last factor ) .",
    "@xmath81 is the normalized recombination emission profile : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the effective frequency width of this emission is @xmath84 , which limits the distance these photons can travel to @xmath85 mpc before redshifting below the heionizing edge .",

    "we include the recombination emissivity in the cosmological radiative transfer calculation by simply adding it to the emissivity from quasars , ignoring the difference in spatial distribution .",
    "we note here that the recombination photons can have a much larger effect on the ionizing background than one might naively expect from their emissivity . as we shall see later , increasing",
    "the emissivity also increases the mean free path of ionizing photons , which amplifies the effect of the additional ionizing photons .",

    ", @xmath87 describes the local opacity due to the forest of individual absorbers in the igm . by inverting this quantity and converting from redshift difference to a comoving distance",
    ", we find the distance per unit optical depth , which is simply the mean free path : @xmath90 if @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the comoving mean free path reduces to @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the gamma function .",
    "the redshift dependence of the mean free path in this simplified model is then @xmath95 .",
    "this power law dependence is a good approximation to describe the evolution of the mean free path of hionizing photons ( @xmath96 ) in our model because the hcddf is fixed , but we find that it fails to capture the more complicated @xmath44-dependent evolution of the mean free path of heionizing photons ( @xmath97 ; see   [ sect : mfpresults ] ) .",
    "recent efforts by @xcite and @xcite have directly measured the hionizing mean free path of the igm near @xmath98 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "for an identical distribution of absorbers , they would report different values than obtained by our approach because they define the mean free path as the distance traveled by a photon through the _ evolving _ igm while it redshifts with the cosmic expansion , rather than the path that could be traveled if the igm and photon retained their original properties ( as is the usual definition for theoretical work ) .",

    "a probability distribution of intensities can be computed assuming random placement of quasars following poisson statistics @xcite .",
    "the effects of this distribution on the _ mean _ ionizing background have not previously been considered .",
    "the next stage in our model is therefore to incorporate the distribution ( in a somewhat ad hoc manner ) in order to understand better the implications of this fluctuating background .",
    "we use the @xcite @xmath100-band quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) to describe the distribution of relative quasar luminosities , assuming an average quasar spectral energy distribution such that the specific luminosity at the hionizing edge is proportional to the @xmath100-band specific luminosity ( @xmath101 ) , then extrapolating to the heionizing edge by a spectral index @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , while the effect is relatively minor @xcite , we convolve the quasar luminosity function with a distribution of far - ultraviolet spectral indices that roughly matches observations by @xcite : a gaussian distribution over @xmath102 with central value @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "note that the asymmetric bounds on @xmath0 lead to an average spectral index of @xmath105 consistent with our fiducial value ( described later in   [ sect : emissparam ] ) . in detail , the average ratio between the emissivity at 1 and 4 ryd will be somewhat higher than the ratio for a @xmath106 spectrum , but we fold this uncertainty into the ionizing background normalization uncertainty described in   [ sect : results ] .",
    "we use the method of characteristic functions from @xcite to determine the probability distribution of intensity , @xmath107 , then scale linearly to @xmath74 by @xmath108 @xcite .",

    ", @xmath113 is substantially larger than @xmath97 , so our approach provides a conservative estimate when used to calculate the amplitude of ionizing background fluctuations .    figure  [ fig : fgamma ] shows how the @xmath109 distribution varies with mean free path .",
    "when the mean free path decreases , the peak of the distribution skews towards smaller @xmath74 relative to the mean . for @xmath74 below the mean , we find that the heopacity of each absorber will increase , with the total opacity increasing as , roughly , @xmath114 using the heabsorber model of section  [ sect : absmodel ] . because this relationship between the ionization rate and opacity is more gentle than linear , the skewness of the @xmath109 distribution results in an average opacity that is _ higher _ than the opacity at the mean @xmath74 .",
    "that is , the lower opacity in rare high @xmath74 regions does not counteract the higher opacity in common low @xmath74 regions .",
    "we explore this effect in the following discussion .",
    "+    we incorporate these fluctuations into our ionizing background model by averaging the opacity @xmath87 ( equations  [ eqn : tbar ] , [ eqn : dtdz ] ) over the distribution @xmath109 : @xmath115 where @xmath87 depends on @xmath74 through the absorber prescription in section  [ sect : absmodel ] and @xmath109 is initialized with the mean free path calculated in the uniform model .",

    "unfortunately , as presented above , the @xmath44 calculation does not converge to a non - zero value ; the added opacity from the @xmath109 prescription causes the iterative procedure to drive @xmath44 down to zero . at relatively high redshifts ( @xmath123 ) the mean free path is short enough ( @xmath124 mpc ) that integrating over @xmath109 greatly increases the opacity . in practice ,",
    "this increased opacity at high redshift propagates small values of @xmath44 to lower redshifts , and the iterative effect pulls @xmath74 down to zero at _ all _ redshifts .",
    "even when the ionizing background is calculated assuming local emission and absorption of photons ( i.e. without an integral over redshift as in equation  [ eqn : jnu ] ) via the absorption - limited approximation @xmath125 @xcite , the divergence to zero remains at @xmath126 .",
    "the reason our procedure breaks down is actually obvious : our cosmological radiative transfer model assumes that ionizing photons are emitted uniformly throughout the universe ( with a constant @xmath19 in equation  [ eqn : rad ] ) , but the real quasar sources are of course point - like .",
    "since the ionizing background near a source is much stronger than the average , the local igm will be less opaque to ionizing photons , and the quasar photons will penetrate farther into the igm  increasing the ionizing background .",

    "<S> our model results in a heionization rate that evolves steeply with redshift , increasing by a factor @xmath1 from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this causes rapid evolution in the mean hely@xmath0 optical depth  as recently observed  without appealing to the reionization of he . </S>",
    "<S> the observed behaviour could instead result from rapid evolution in the mean free path of ionizing photons as the helium in higher hcolumn density absorbers becomes fully ionized .    </S>",
