    "in recent years it has become clear that the superconducting phase of the hole - doped cuprate superconductors is of unconventional , @xmath0-wave , symmetry . motivated by this observation ,",
    "the properties of quasi - particle states in @xmath0-wave superconductors have come under intense scrutiny . a particular subject that turned out to be not only experimentally relevant but also theoretically intricate is the influence of _ static disorder _ on the large - scale features of the @xmath0-wave phase .",
    "leaving aside the pair - breaking effect of the disorder which strongly influences the high - temperature properties , attempts to resolve the impact of impurity scattering on low temperature spectral and transport properties of a disordered @xmath0-wave superconductor have ignited controversy in the recent literature .",
    "the key feature which distinguishes @xmath0-wave from the more conventional @xmath1-wave superconductors , and makes the disorder problem harder to solve , is the presence of four isolated `` nodes '' on the fermi surface in the vicinity of which low - lying dirac - type @xcite quasi - particle excitations exist . beginning with the work of gorkov and kalugin @xcite , and later lee @xcite , the earliest considerations , based on approximate self - consistent treatments , concluded that an arbitrarily weak impurity potential induces a finite density of states ( dos ) at the fermi surface , and leads to weak localization of all quasi - particle states in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) system .",
    "although the first result found support , at least superficially , in an analysis by ziegler et al .",
    "@xcite , these conclusions were found to be in contradiction with those of other authors .    in particular , following the early considerations of refs .",
    "@xcite , nersesyan , tsvelik and wenger @xcite ( ntw ) developed a complementary approach in which the quasi - particle green functions of a disordered @xmath0-wave superconductor were mapped on a conformally invariant fermion - replica field theory . based on this mapping , ntw proposed that the 2d system is characterized by critical properties of the quasi - particle states at the fermi level .",
    "their model predicted that the dos vanishes as @xmath2 with some disorder - dependent exponent @xmath3 .    to further add to this controversy , senthil , fisher , balents , and",
    "nayak @xcite ( sfbn ) proposed a description by an alternative fermion - replica field theory , namely the principal chiral non - linear sigma model over the symplectic group @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ) .",
    "void of any signatures of criticality , the large - scale behaviour of the two - dimensional model was argued to describe a phase of localized states , the `` spin insulator '' , thereby finding qualitative agreement with the early considerations and contradicting the findings of ntw . in contradiction to _ both _ ntw and the early works , the quasi - particle dos at the fermi level was found to vanish with a universal exponent of unity .    since this work , further analysis of the field - theoretic scheme generated fresh , and seemingly contradictory proposals .",
    "fendley and konik @xcite have argued that , when the scattering between pairs of opposite nodes is neglected , the low - energy properties of the weakly disordered system are described by a _",
    "critical _ field theory that has @xmath4 ( with @xmath6 ) for its target space and includes a wess - zumino term .",
    "the same theory , now based on a peculiar implementation of a time - reversal symmetry breaking lattice operator , had been suggested by fukui @xcite . albeit belonging to a different universality class , both proposals @xcite and @xcite share key aspects with the theory of ntw , including the existence of extended quasi - particle states .",
    "how , if indeed at all , can the largely contradictory approaches be reconciled with each other ? and is it possible to unify elements of these approaches into one coherent theoretical formulation ?",
    "this is the first complex of questions we are going to address in this paper .    a second and more pragmatic point we are going to address concerns the microscopic nature of the impurity scattering .",
    "it will turn out that much of the controversy in the field - theoretical literature described above can be attributed to the sensitivity of the @xmath0-wave quasi - particle physics to the range of the scattering potential . in a number of recent publications @xcite ,",
    "it has been argued that both experimental and theoretical evidence hints at a strong enhancement of forward scattering in @xmath0-wave superconductors . without going into details , we here merely state the essence of the argument , viz .  that a significant amount of inter - node scattering would have a strong pair - breaking effect , thereby being in conflict with the very _ formation _ of stable @xmath0-wave order . actually figuring out the meaning of the attribute `` significant '' is a delicate issue we will not even attempt to address . notwithstanding this uncertainty , one may ask the principal question of what kind of low - energy theory governs the behaviour of quasi - particle hamiltonians that are strongly anisotropic ( albeit certainly not _ exclusively _ forward scattering ) on the bare microscopic level .",
    "in particular , the question arises whether , as in disordered metallic systems , the impurity form factor merely leads to a renormalization of the scattering time or whether it might have a more substantial effect . as we are going to argue below",
    ", the latter is the case here : the extreme cases of pure forward scattering and isotropic scattering fall into distinct universality classes with qualitatively different properties . and ,",
    "although the isotropic limit is ultimately attractive ( in the renormalization group sense ) , one might speculate that under realistic conditions ( finite temperatures , experimental resolutions , etc . )",
    "the forward - scattering limit could well be the relevant one .",
    "a second aspect that makes the limit of weak forward scattering an interesting object of study concerns the physics of the mixed state : as with conventional type - ii superconductors , the application of a magnetic field of intermediate strength @xmath7 forces vortices into the @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "the impact of vortex formation on the low - energy density of quasi - particle states of _ pure _ @xmath0-wave superconductors has been the subject of an ongoing debate @xcite .",
    "recently , significant progress was made by franz and tesanovic @xcite , who exploited a novel singular gauge transformation , mapping the problem again on the problem of dirac fermions .",
    "this transformation , which is analogous to that applied in the theory of the fractional quantum hall effect , is applicable even in the presence of randomness . as a result ,",
    "one obtains an effective low - energy model , essentially dirac fermions with random scalar and vector potential , that can be applied to explore the quasi - particle dos of the _ disordered _ vortex lattice .",
    "we will return to this subject below .",
    "although , for a non - expert , the detailed field - theoretical analysis contained in this paper is often somewhat involved , we believe that the main conclusions of our survey of the dirty `` @xmath0-wave system ''  for lack of a better terminology we will often refer to the quasi - particles of a disordered @xmath0-wave superconductor by that word  should be widely accessible .",
    "we have , therefore , chosen to summarize the complete phase diagram here in the introduction . at the same time , this allows us to organize and place into context many of the existing field - theoretical works on the subject .",
    "while , at first sight , the various points brought up above seem unrelated , the microscopic analysis below will show that they do , in fact , all find their origin in a common microscopic mechanism .",
    "just as for the clean @xmath0-wave gorkov hamiltonian @xcite , the hilbert space for the low - energy hamiltonian of the pure forward - scattering system foliates into four sectors not connected by the disorder potential .",
    "these nodal sectors can be grouped into pairs related by parity .",
    "the low - energy physics of the individual sectors turns out to be more intricate than that of the complete system , which is comprised of four dirac nodes coupled by impurity scattering . in general",
    "it will , of course , be the behaviour of the full system that matters .",
    "there are , however , a number of situations in which signatures of the decoupled system remain visible . exploring these scenarios , which are accompanied by a drastic change in the phenomenology of the system , is one of the major issues to be addressed in this paper .",
    "the origin of the relative non - triviality of the decoupled system can be understood qualitatively by noticing that the structure of any theory describing the low - lying quasi - particle excitations of a disordered system is essentially fixed by two types of symmetries : `` intrinsic '' symmetries , such as the behaviour of the hamiltonian under spin - rotation , time - reversal , particle - hole transformations etc . , and",
    "`` extrinsic '' symmetries such as translational or rotational invariance or , for that matter , parity . specifically , the unperturbed @xmath0-wave superconductor is a particle - hole symmetric , spin - rotation and time - reversal invariant system , thereby falling into the symmetry class @xmath8i in the classification of ref .",
    "the implementation of these intrinsic symmetries into an effective low - energy theory of a superconductor system was formulated some time ago by oppermann @xcite , and was recently rederived in the context of @xmath0-wave superconductivity by sfbn @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the @xmath0-wave system under extrinsic symmetry operations is more remarkable .",
    "in fact , as we will see , it is disregard for these symmetries that has driven astray some of the field theories based on intrinsic symmetry : not all terms allowed by the intrinsic symmetries respect the extrinsic symmetries .",
    "the point is that individual nodes are non - invariant under `` parity '' , by which we mean any operation that reverses the orientation of two - dimensional space @xcite . of course , the full four - node system emerging from a manifestly invariant gorkov hamiltonian is parity invariant , but individual nodes are not .",
    "remarkably , this parity non - invariance and the intrinsic symmetries conspire to let the system of isolated nodes fall into a symmetry class that differs from the wigner - dyson classes _ and _ the classes commonly attributed to bulk superconductors .",
    "the complete phase diagram of the @xmath0-wave system in fact separates into a total of four distinct regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sym ] ) distinguished by the presence / absence of time - reversal invariance and by the correlation radius of the disorder potential . taking each region in turn",
    ", we here summarize the phenomenology and the basic properties of the respective low - energy theories @xcite .",
    "= 3.5 in      so , beginning with the time - reversal invariant system with only forward scattering , one finds that the corresponding symmetry class is not @xmath8i , but rather @xmath9iii , i.e.  a symmetry class that is typically realized in disordered relativistic ( chiral ) fermion systems .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to verify that the low - energy physics of individual nodes is described by a model of dirac fermions in the presence of some quenched random gauge field .",
    "the implications of this correspondence for the disordered system were first noticed and analysed in the seminal work of ntw @xcite , who pointed out that the low - energy physics of the individual nodes is critical .",
    "ntw argued that a general mechanism uncovered long ago by witten @xcite applies in particular to the @xmath0-wave system : in a lagrangian formulation based on non - abelian bosonization , non - trivial transformation behaviour with respect to parity is reflected by the presence of a wess - zumino - novikov - witten ( wzw ) term in the action functional .",
    "specifically , ntw mapped the @xmath0-wave system on a field theory with @xmath10 symmetry ( @xmath11 being the number of replicas ) . in the limit of isolated nodes",
    "@xmath12 , the theory has the field manifold @xmath13 , with the @xmath14 sector being governed by a so - called level-@xmath15 wzw action .",
    "the latter theory enjoys the existence of an infinite - dimensional ( current algebra ) symmetry , which makes it solvable to a large extent .",
    "several of its features , including the existence of algebraically decaying correlations ( absence of localization ! ) , and the scaling of the dos in the vicinity of the fermi energy can be derived rigorously .    within the framework of the supersymmetric formulation ,",
    "the properties of the forward - scattering system are found to be described by two copies of a wzw model of level @xmath15 and type @xmath16 , i.e.  a wzw model whose fields take values in a supermanifold that , for reasons discussed in body of the paper , is labeled by @xmath16 .",
    "each copy derives from a pair of nodes on the fermi surface related by parity or inversion symmetry .",
    "formally , the total zero - energy effective action is given by @xmath17 + w[m_2^{-1 } , \\gamma^{-1 } ] + g^\\prime \\int d^2r \\ , { \\cal o}_{00}^\\prime$ ] where the dimensionless parameter @xmath18 ( defined microscopically later ) specifies the degree of anisotropy of the dirac cones , and @xmath19 \\equiv { i\\over 12\\pi } \\gamma[m ] + g \\int d^2r\\ , { \\cal      o}_{00 } \\\\ & & -{1\\over 8\\pi } \\int d^2r \\ , { \\rm str } \\left (      \\gamma^{-1 } \\partial_1 m^{-1}\\partial_1 m + \\gamma \\partial_2      m^{-1}\\partial_2 m\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the anisotropic wzw action . the fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 take values in ( a maximal riemannian subspace of ) the supergroup @xmath22 , @xmath23 $ ] represents the wzw term , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are low - angle scattering operators whose specific structure will be described in section [ sec : boso ] .",
    "note that , since the wzw term is odd under @xmath26 ( i.e.  @xmath27 = - \\gamma[m]$ ] ) , the wzw terms for the two sectors of nodes carry _ opposite _ sign , which reflects the fact that they derive from dirac operators carrying opposite orientations .",
    "further , the fact that @xmath28 and not @xmath29  the supersymmetric analog of a fermion replica theory with group manifold @xmath30  appears as the relevant degree of freedom , has to do with the behaviour of the system under time reversal .",
    "this aspect , unimportant for the physics of the system of isolated nodes , becomes vitally relevant once inter - node scattering is switched on .",
    "perhaps the most characteristic feature of models of dirac fermions subject to abelian gauge randomness is their stability under renormalization .",
    "indeed , the low - energy theory defined by the action @xmath31 is a fixed point of the renormalization group for each value of the dimensionless disorder strength @xmath32 , as long as @xmath32 does not exceed some critical value .",
    "the absence of running couplings bears consequences for various physical observables .",
    "one finds that , for low energies , the dos vanishes as @xmath33 , with the @xmath32-dependent family of exponents @xmath34 in accord with the analysis of ntw .",
    "we also recapitulate that the eigenstates of the random gauge dirac system are extended @xcite .",
    "while exhibiting critical spectral and transport properties , the effective action for @xmath0-wave superconductors in class @xmath9iii is unstable against the influence of short - range isotropic scattering , a matter not correctly handled by ntw .",
    "impurity scattering involving large momentum transfer couples the nodes and leads to a `` locking '' of the fields at the different nodes .",
    "this process bears two consequences for the structure of the low - energy theory : first , and in contradiction to the naive expectation , the field configurations surviving the locking of the formerly independent @xmath22 fields take values in a different manifold , viz .",
    "second , the locking @xmath36 implies that in the full action the wzw terms cancel , which makes the restoration of parity invariance in the coupled system explicit .",
    "( in parentheses we note that the absence of a wzw term is a sufficient but _ not _ a necessary condition for parity invariance of physical observables : for a single wzw theory , the sign change in @xmath23 $ ] caused by a parity operation can be compensated by a field transformation @xmath37 , i.e.  the field @xmath38 is a pseudo - scalar .",
    "however , in a system comprised of _ two _ coupled sub - theories carrying opposite orientations , this compensating transformation is inhibited on either sub - theory .",
    "moreover , there exists no room for a wzw term in the locked full theory , as the sum of coupled dirac theories for the @xmath0-wave system is anomaly - free . )",
    "since it was the wzw term that rendered the ntw theory critical , it is evident that the low - energy behaviour of the full theory will be of different type .",
    "a fermion - replica theory of the full system , a non - linear sigma model on the field manifold @xmath4 , was first derived and analysed by sfbn .",
    "essentially , this model is a @xmath0-wave version of the @xmath39 non - linear sigma model formulation of time - reversal invariant superconducting glasses developed earlier by oppermann @xcite .",
    "void of any elements supporting critical behaviour , the predictions of that theory differ greatly from ntw : all quasi - particle states are localized , a fact that led sfbn to coin the term `` spin insulator '' ; the dos still vanishes at zero energy but in a manner altogether different from the scaling obtained by ntw .",
    "all in all , the low - energy theory of the composite four - node system seems to have little overlap with the critical theory of the decoupled forward - scattering system .",
    "once the fields belonging to the different nodal sectors become locked , the total effective action from above takes the form @xmath40 = w[m,\\gamma ] + w[m^{-1},\\gamma^{-1}]$ ] , i.e. @xmath41= - { \\gamma+\\gamma^{-1 } \\over 8\\pi } \\int d^2r \\ , { \\rm str }    \\left ( \\partial_\\mu m^{-1 } \\partial_\\mu m\\right ) \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the field @xmath42 now belongs to the group manifold @xmath43 .",
    "technically this is a principal chiral non - linear sigma model of type @xmath44 .",
    "it represents a supersymmetric extension of the action derived by sfbn @xcite , and leads to the prediction of quasi - particle localization of all states in two dimensions  the spin insulator phase  and a dos that vanishes at zero energy .",
    "it seems unlikely that symmetry class @xmath9iii is realized in the physical @xmath0-wave system . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the bare microscopic theory will probably contain a large forward - scattering amplitude , plus a certain amount of inter - node scattering rendering it a member of symmetry class @xmath8i .",
    "this hard - scattering admixture is a relevant perturbation which means that the theory will ultimately flow towards the strong - coupling fixed point in class @xmath8i . on the other hand ,",
    "realistic experimental conditions are likely to prevent the system from exploring all limiting regions of the phase diagram .",
    "this motivates us to ask how fast the flow towards the strong - coupling regime takes place and what properties the crossover theories , situated somewhere in between the independent - node and the strongly coupled theory , possess .",
    "we will return to this issue below .",
    "an alternative mechanism of allowing elements of the decoupled theory to resurface is by breaking parity _",
    "explicitly_. at least theoretically , this is realized in the so - called spin quantum - hall ( sqh ) system @xcite , where the nodal degeneracy is lifted via the addition of an @xmath45 component to the order parameter .",
    "the resulting low - energy phase shares much of its phenomenology  the formation of edge states , quantized values of the transverse component of the conductivity tensor , etc .",
    " with the integer quantum hall effect and has , therefore , been christened the spin quantum hall state .",
    "( the prefix `` spin '' indicates that in the superconductor problem , the behaviour of spin currents or thermal currents is considered .",
    "because of the non - conservation of quasi - particle charge , the study of charge transport coefficients becomes meaningless . )",
    "originally , it was suggested @xcite that the formation of a secondary @xmath46-order parameter component giving the @xmath47 state might be quasi - spontaneously driven by a weak external magnetic field .",
    "recent work @xcite has cast some doubt on the applicability of this scenario and , therefore , on the experimental relevance of the spin quantum hall effect .",
    "theoretically , however , the @xmath47 system remains an interesting object of study : first , it represents a rare example of a system with an exactly solvable quantum - hall phase transition driven by disorder @xcite .",
    "second , unlike with @xmath0-wave superconductors in the previously discussed symmetry class @xmath8i , aspects of the physics of individual nodes survive the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in fact , the @xmath46-component does more than lift the node degeneracy , implying that it does not lead to a resurrection of the wzw model : the inclusion of an @xmath48 component not only breaks parity but also time - reversal invariance , and hence reduces the symmetry of the system from @xmath8i down to @xmath8 . within a fermion - replica approach ,",
    "the class @xmath8 system is described by a field theory taking values on the manifold @xmath49 .",
    "this field theory does not support a wzw term .",
    "it does , however , admit for the existence of a closely related parity - breaking term in the lagrangian , viz .  a topological theta term . based on phenomenological considerations ,",
    "it has in fact been argued @xcite that a non - linear sigma model over @xmath49 with a theta term should be the relevant theory of the disordered @xmath47 system .",
    "exploring how such a theory may emerge as a descendant of the class @xmath8i theory of the non - degenerate node system will be a further topic to be addressed below .",
    "the explicit form of the resulting supersymmetric soft - mode action for the system of class @xmath8 reads as @xmath50 where the wzw term has transformed into a topological theta term .",
    "in contrast to the conventional integer quantum hall effect exhibited by normal systems , the fields of the saddle - point manifold @xmath51 belong to the coset space @xmath52 , with the relevant riemannian symmetric superspace inside that manifold being of type @xmath53 .    unlike its normal relative ,",
    "the critical theory for the spin quantum hall effect for class @xmath8 is readily amenable to theoretical investigation . indeed",
    "the properties of this phase have been explored in a number of recent numerical and analytical works .",
    "surprisingly , a mapping @xcite of the class @xmath8 theory onto a network model @xcite shows the transition to be in the same universality class as classical percolation @xcite .",
    "this correspondence , which applies only for the statistics of various low - order moments , relies on a remarkable cancellation of interference channels , and allows several of the critical exponents to be determined exactly @xcite .",
    "very recently , a proposal for the general critical theory of the spin quantum hall transition has been made by bernard and leclair @xcite , although its validity still remains a matter of some controversy .      to exhaust the number of different low - energy scenarios realized in the @xmath0-wave system ,",
    "one may consider a situation where a perturbation breaking time - reversal symmetry is superimposed on an impurity potential causing only forward scattering .",
    "below we will identify the resulting system as a member of symmetry class @xmath9 , i.e. the standard wigner - dyson class of unitary symmetry .",
    "we find that , as with its class @xmath8 counterpart , the class @xmath9 system also supports a ( spin ) quantum hall transition .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , however , that transition turns out to fall into the universality class of the standard integer quantum hall transition .",
    "formally , the low - energy theory is again described by an action functional including a theta term , similar to the one above .",
    "the main differences with the previously discussed case are that ( a ) one obtains two copies @xmath54 $ ] of the action , one for each nodal sector , and ( b ) that the fields @xmath55 @xmath56 belong to the coset space @xmath57 .",
    "this means that the field theory is of type @xmath58 which is the supersymmetric extension of pruisken s theory for the conventional integer quantum hall effect .    finally",
    ", we remark on a second and , arguably , more physically motivated scenario in which the classes @xmath9 and @xmath8 are engaged  the mixed phase of a type - ii superconductor . on symmetry grounds alone",
    ", one would expect the hamiltonian of the vortex phase of the dirty @xmath0-wave system to belong to one of these classes .",
    "although the nature of the quasi - particle states in the vortex phase of the clean @xmath0-wave system has been addressed in a number of ( seemingly controversial ) publications @xcite , a field - theoretic analysis of this disordered system has not been given in the literature .",
    "this motivates us to focus our discussion of the symmetry classes @xmath8 and @xmath9 on the mixed state , not on the spin quantum hall system .",
    "furthermore , for brevity , we have chosen not to comment upon the influence of the breaking of spin rotational invariance either by magnetic impurities or spin - orbit scatterers .",
    "such systems , which lie outside the scope of present work , have been addressed in the recent literature and we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the phenomenology of these systems .",
    "altogether , the key characteristics of the field theories for the @xmath0-wave system are summarized in the following table :     goldstone modes & saddle - point manifold & nl@xmath59 m & fermion - replica analog + @xmath9iii & + & @xmath60 & @xmath61 & @xmath22 & @xmath16 & @xmath62 + @xmath9 & @xmath60 & @xmath60 & @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath9iii@xmath65iii & @xmath66 + @xmath8i & + & + & @xmath67 & @xmath35 & @xmath44 & @xmath4 + @xmath8 & @xmath60 & + & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & @xmath70iii@xmath71i & @xmath72 +     +    2 note that the contents of this table are in complete agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , where each of the ten symmetry classes , as enumerated by the large families of cartan s list of irreducible symmetric spaces , was put in correspondence with the saddle - point manifold of a non - linear sigma model .",
    "this coincidence is by no means accidental . although ref .",
    "@xcite was formulated in the random - matrix setting , the translation scheme employed there is of universal validity and unerringly identifies the _ internal _ ( field - theoretical ) global symmetries for each symmetry class .",
    "the present treatment has the virtue of being well adapted to the specific case of @xmath0-wave superconductors , and shows quite explicitly how the hierarchy of goldstone modes emerges in this context .      before leaving this introductory section ,",
    "let us return to the controversy between the predictions made by the various field - theoretical approaches , and the self - consistent diagrammatic schemes developed in the literature .",
    "readers who find the following , purely qualitative , remarks cryptic are referred to section [ sec : comparison ] for a more substantial discussion .",
    "the last few years have seen a build - up of confusion concerning the behaviour of the density of states at very small energies : straightforward diagrammatic analysis predicts a finite dos at zero energy , whereas , in the field theory approaches , unbounded fluctuations of goldstone modes lead to a vanishing dos .",
    "an intuitive argument in favor of a finite dos is that any average over random potential fluctuations should introduce some imaginary self energy @xmath73 in the green function of the dirac operator .",
    "this self energy would lead to a smearing of spectral structures over some energy window of width given by @xmath73 and would , therefore , be in conflict with the formation of a cusp in the energy - dependent dos .",
    "this argument , however , is overly simple ; in particular it does not account for the full complexity of the scattering problem in random dirac ( or gapless superconductor ) systems .",
    "let us try to discuss this point on a somewhat more technical level :    the various classes of diagrams appearing in perturbative approaches can be grouped , roughly speaking , into two categories : diagrams of the self - energy type ( commonly evaluated in scba or similar approximations ) , and various types of ladder diagrams ( alias diffusion modes ) . while the former are usually associated with some smearing of average single - particle quantities by disorder ,",
    "the latter describe mesoscopic fluctuations which become operative at long range .",
    "more precisely , ladder diagrams describe the long - range quantum interference between retarded and advanced single - particle green functions . for normal - conducting systems ,",
    "the distinction between these diagrammatic elements is perfectly canonical : single - particle green functions are renormalized by self - energy diagrams whereas higher - order green functions with poles on both sides of the real energy axis may be influenced by diffusion modes .    for superconductors however , and for gapless superconductors in particular ,",
    "this distinction breaks down . in previous diagrammatic approaches ,",
    "the dos of dirty @xmath0-wave superconductors was computed with ( self - consistent ) account for self - energy diagrams .",
    "this led to some smearing and , therefore , to a finite dos .",
    "however , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the prototypical case of superconductor / normal quantum dots , the single - particle dos of a gapless superconductor may be affected by diffusion - like modes .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood on various levels of sophistication .",
    "it can be explained by qualitative semi - classical reasoning @xcite or , more technically , by the fact that unlike in normal systems the single - particle green function of a superconductor possesses poles on both sides of the real energy axis . while for a bulk",
    "@xmath1-wave superconductor , all poles are shifted far into the complex plane by the bulk order parameter ( a manifestation of anderson s theorem @xcite ) , the situation in gapless systems is different . here",
    ", multiple impurity scattering suppresses the self energy .",
    "technically , the suppression is caused by ladder diagrams that sum up to yield diffusion modes .",
    "these modes enter _ already at the single - particle level _ @xcite , and are missing from previous diagrammatic works on @xmath0-wave superconductivity .    in the limit of zero energy ,",
    "the diffusion modes become massless ( or of infinite range ) implying that a purely perturbative approach is met with a problem .",
    "( technically , in two dimensions , the contribution of each diffusion mode scales as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is some cutoff energy and @xmath32 a measure of the dimensionless ( spin ) conductance of the system . for @xmath76",
    "sufficiently small , the expansion becomes uncontrolled . ) at this point it is good to remember that all the concepts discussed above have a field - theoretical analog , with an optional non - perturbative extension .",
    "in particular , the diffusion modes of the diagrammatic approach have the significance of perturbative excitations of the goldstone modes discussed above  very much like a spin wave can be interpreted as a perturbative manifestation of the goldstone mode related to the intrinsic spin - rotation symmetry of a ferromagnet .",
    "the fluctuations of these modes , restricted only by finite energies , become stronger and stronger as the energy approaches zero .",
    "for sufficiently small energies , ( a ) perturbative ( diagrammatic ) schemes for treating these modes are ruled out , and ( b ) the non - perturbative analyses discussed below produce a vanishing dos .",
    "( in passing we note that such mechanisms are not unfamiliar in mesoscopic physics .",
    "for example , for energy differences @xmath77 larger than the mean level spacing @xmath78 , spectral correlations of generic normal disordered systems can be treated by diffusion - mode diagrammatic approaches . for",
    "@xmath79 perturbation theory breaks down , a phenomenon that manifests itself in the appearance of unphysical divergences . in this regime , a non - perturbative integration over the appropriate goldstone mode @xcite produces the correct result . ) summarizing , we find that ( i ) the issue of the dos is crucially related to long - range modes of quantum interference operating on the single - particle level , ( ii ) to obtain the correct , vanishing , behaviour of the dos , a non - perturbative treatment of these modes in inevitable but that ( iii ) _ signatures _ for the incompleteness of previous perturbative analyses can be found within the diagrammatic framework .",
    "now , it is important to realize that the arguments above by no means amount to a categoric prediction of a vanishing zero - energy dos in bulk @xmath0-wave superconductors .",
    "the point is that the weak disorder field - theoretical approach is based on certain model assumptions which leave room for complementary scenarios .",
    "therefore , to complete our introductory discussion , let us briefly mention a number of competing theories of the disordered @xmath0-wave system which lie outside the field - theoretic scheme outlined above .",
    "typically such theories rely on peculiarities of the @xmath0-wave system .",
    "for example , balatsky and salkola @xcite have proposed a mechanism whereby the weak coupling of `` marginally - bound '' impurity states at the fermi level leads to the absence of quasi - particle localization .",
    "when subject to a _ single _",
    "impurity in the unitarity limit , a quasi - particle state is created at zero energy @xcite . in a recent work , ppin and lee @xcite",
    "have proposed that , when subjected to many such impurities , these quasi - particle states broaden into a narrow delocalized band around zero energy . on this basis , these authors have proposed that the properties of the dirty @xmath0-wave system at very low energies are characterized by extended quasi - particle states .",
    "based on the rg analysis contained in this paper , it is our belief that , even for scatterers in the unitarity limit , there must ultimately be a cross - over at low - energy scales to the physics advocated by sfbn .",
    "finally , some authors @xcite have inquired into the importance of maintaining self - consistency of the @xmath0-wave order parameter in a disordered background . as others before ,",
    "in this work we will take a pragmatic view and will not attempt a synthesis of self - consistent aspects of the theory .    a second and probably more severe",
    "limitation regards the role of interactions . as with more conventional disordered normal and superconductor systems ,",
    "the low - energy physics of quasi - particles in @xmath0-wave superconductors , too , will be affected by various mechanisms of inter - particle interactions : zero - bias anomalies , interaction contributions to transport coefficients , interaction induced renormalization of the propagation in the cooper channel , and more . beyond that , one should expect that _ collective _ excitations , both of purely electronic and of phononic type , contribute to ( thermal ) transport coefficients , and further modify the low - energy behaviour of quasi - particle states .",
    "none of these effects will be considered in the present paper .",
    "( for a discussion of interaction effects in @xmath0-wave superconductors , see ref .",
    "needless to say , this may impose severe limitations on the relevance of the present work for the physics of real @xmath0-wave superconductors .    to what extent do the predictions of the weakly disordered theory bear comparison with experiment ?",
    "as mentioned above , superconductors of unconventional @xmath0-wave symmetry are realized in the high - temperature cuprate superconductors . here",
    "the influence of both magnetic and non - magnetic impurities has been investigated intensively . in @xmath0-wave systems ,",
    "both types of disorder are pair - breaking and lead to a rapid depression of @xmath80 with doping . however , at very low doping concentrations",
    ", @xmath80 remains a significant fraction of its optimal value . in this case",
    "the influence of disorder on the low - energy quasi - particle properties have been studied extensively .",
    "in particular , recent angle resolved photoemission experiments @xcite confirm both the integrity of the large - scale nodal structure of the spectrum and confirm the existence of long - lived quasi - particle states near the fermi level .",
    "the same measurements show a large anisotropy of the dirac nodes with , for example , bi@xmath81sr@xmath81cacu@xmath81o@xmath82 exhibiting a ratio of @xmath83 .    at very low temperatures , phase coherence properties of the quasi - particle states should be accessible via spin transport . the latter have been investigated indirectly through measurements of the thermal conductivity at very low temperatures : relating the thermal conductance @xmath84 to the quasi - particle spin conductivity @xmath85 through the einstein relation , one obtains the wiedemann - franz ratio @xmath86 . taking the bare value for the spin conductance from theory , one obtains @xcite @xmath87 remarkably",
    ", this result is found to be in close agreement with experiment @xcite . in biscco",
    "the extrapolated value of the longitudinal part of the thermal conductivity remains constant over a wide range of impurity concentrations .",
    "this result has been triumphed ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) as experimental support for the self - consistent theory of lee @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that this result does not sit comfortably with the class @xmath8i theory , which predicts that the spin conductance should exhibit weak localization corrections which renormalize @xmath85 down from its universal bare value . whether the seeming coincidence of the measured conductance and the bare value signifies strongly enhanced forward scattering , or whether , as seems more likely",
    ", it can be explained in terms of a short phase coherence length , is as yet unclear . on this point , it is interesting to note that low - temperature measurements of the quasi - particle conductivity in the underdoped cuprate yba@xmath81cu@xmath88o@xmath82 @xcite indicate that the quasi - particle states are localized .",
    "although it would be useful to explore the thermal hall transport @xcite , experiments have been so far unable to access the same very low temperature regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : basics ] we will formulate some basic concepts required for the construction of a low - energy theory of the @xmath0-wave system .",
    "this will include a symmetry analysis of the disordered hamiltonian , its representation in terms of a ( supersymmetric ) generating functional , and a renormalization group analysis of the relevancy of the various channels of disorder . in section [ sec : proceed ] we ask how an effective low - energy theory can be distilled from the microscopic functional integral .",
    "we will find that standard schemes , such as a straightforward gradient expansion , are met with severe difficulties . in section [ sec : boso ]",
    ", non - abelian bosonization will be applied as an alternative method to derive the low - energy theory . in a number of subsections",
    "the predictions of this theory for the four symmetry variants introduced above will be discussed . in section [ sec : comparison ]",
    "we compare these results with the phenomenology predicted by other approaches , such as self - consistent @xmath89-matrix approaches . to complement the theoretical analysis of the low - energy properties of the d - wave system , in section  [ sec : numer - analys - quasi ] we present a limited review of the progress made in the numerical investigation of the density of states and show how these results relate to the different regimes discussed in the text .",

    "in this section we discuss the essential concepts needed for the construction of a low - energy effective theory describing the quasi - particles of a disordered spin - singlet superconductor with @xmath90 symmetry .",
    "we start out by reviewing some elementary features of the gorkov hamiltonian for that system .",
    "much attention will be paid to the generic symmetries , which turn out to be quite subtle .",
    "we then express the green functions of the hamiltonian as a field integral .",
    "the result is a supersymmetric generating functional , which will serve as the basic platform for the low - energy effective field theories developed in later sections .",
    "similar considerations for a class of related two - dimensional systems , having a low - energy limit modeled by a disordered dirac equation , were first made by fradkin @xcite .",
    "basic to the theory of quasi - particle transport in spin - singlet superconductors are the gorkov equations @xcite .",

    "after the introduction of small momentum offsets by setting @xmath115 , the dispersion relation in the vicinity of the nodal points is approximated as @xmath116 where @xmath117 .",
    "thus the dispersion relation near the nodal points is linear in @xmath118 , and the low - energy physics will therefore be of dirac type . anticipating that we will be primarily interested in the nodal regions , we introduce four species of fermion operators , @xmath119 where @xmath120 labels the nodes , with the assignments to node momenta @xmath121 being @xmath122",
    "if we restrict attention to the low - energy sector , the hamiltonian of the clean system decomposes into four nodal sub - hamiltonians : @xmath123 with the definition of the characteristic speed @xmath124 and the anisotropy parameter @xmath18 by @xmath125 the continuum real space representations of the operators @xmath126 are @xmath127 here @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) and @xmath130 .",

    "exactly how vortices influence the low - energy density of quasi - particle states of a pure @xmath0-wave superconductor has been the subject of an ongoing debate @xcite .",
    "progress was recently made by franz and tesanovic ( ft ) @xcite , who suggested to perform a singular gauge transformation similar to what is done in the chern - simons gauge theory of the fractional quantum hall effect . because each vortex carries half a magnetic flux quantum , a unit cell consisting of two vortices",

    "the only agent we will need is the scalar potential proportional to @xmath166 , and this can be produced also from a gauge transformation that treats particles and holes on an equal footing .",
    "an essential pre - requisite to the construction of the low - energy effective theory for dirty @xmath0-wave superconductors , just as for disordered metals , is a solid understanding of the fundamental symmetries of the quasi - particle hamiltonian . in recent years",
    "it has become clear that , because of quantum interference channels that owe their existence to the particle - hole degree of freedom of the gorkov equations , the low - energy quasi - particles of disordered superconductors transcend the established framework of the `` threefold way '' @xcite , namely the wigner - dyson classification scheme by unitary , orthogonal , or symplectic symmetry .",

    "these have been termed @xmath8 , @xmath167 , @xmath70 , and @xmath168 . specifically , spin - singlet superconductors ( with conserved quasi - particle spin ) belong to the classes @xmath8 or @xmath169 , depending on whether time - reversal symmetry is broken or not .    while these are the generic symmetry classes of dirty superconductors , other classes appear , and complicate the symmetry pattern , if system - specific conservation laws of exact or approximate nature are present .",
    "as we have reviewed , the low - energy quasi - particles of @xmath0-wave superconductors organize into four nodal sectors . in the physically relevant case of `` soft '' disorder ,",
    "the scattering between nodes is suppressed as compared to the scattering within nodes .",
    "of course , on very large time scales any small amount of scattering couples the nodes , leading to generic low - energy behaviour . on intermediate time",

    "what symmetry class the disordered quasi - particles confined to a single node belong to , is not immediate from general principles . by inspection , we will find that the class is @xmath170 if time reversal invariance is present , and @xmath9 if not . while the latter is just the cartan label for the `` unitary '' wigner - dyson class , an example for",
    "the former are dirac fermions in a random @xmath171 gauge field ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "we begin by recalling that the gorkov hamiltonian for a disordered spin - singlet superconductor satisfies the relation @xmath172 which we refer to as `` particle - hole '' ( ph ) symmetry .",
    "its physical origin is conservation of spin in conjunction with fermi statistics , and it is violated if and only if spin ceases to be a constant of the motion . for systems where time - reversal invariance holds , which implies the absence of external fields and complex order parameter components such as @xmath48 , the hamiltonian matrix can be chosen to be real symmetric : @xmath173 . because of the rotation by @xmath174 made in going to equation ( [ hath ] ) , time - reversal symmetry here does not take its canonical form but is expressed by @xmath175 when both @xmath176 and @xmath177 are valid symmetries , the quasi - particles of the superconductor are said to be in class @xmath169 . when @xmath177 is broken but @xmath176 is still present , the symmetry class changes to @xmath8 .",

    "we see that , _ before _",
    "linearization and projection on the four nodes , the off - diagonal block @xmath182 still obeyed the constraint of being a symmetric matrix .",
    "what is the origin of this apparent discrepancy ?",
    "the answer is this . in writing @xmath183 and making the assignment to nodes",
    ", we used _",
    "different _ conventions in the `` particle '' ( @xmath184 ) and `` hole '' ( @xmath185 ) sectors , so as to arrange for @xmath180 in ( [ h_0 ] ) to have entries only on the diagonal .",
    "if we had taken the conventions to be the same , we would have obtained @xmath186 with @xmath187 and @xmath188 both of which are symmetric , in agreement with ( [ h_ci ] ) .",
    "as follows from the expression for @xmath189 , here one has to imagine that the pure dirac hamiltonian flips the particle - hole spinor between the particle state of one node , say @xmath15 , and the hole state of its conjugate , @xmath190 .",
    "this interpretation , while perfectly valid and compatible with momentum conservation , is _ not _ the one commonly adopted in the literature . there , one follows the convention of interchanging the two hole states , so that the dirac hamiltonian simply flips between the particle and hole states of one and the same node . to facilitate comparison with the literature",
    ", we tacitly made this change of basis in section [ sec : d_wave_ham ] .",
    "the transformation between the two bases is effected by a matrix we denote by @xmath191 : @xmath192 by multiplying the particle - hole spinor with this permutation matrix in the hole sector ( but not in the particle sector ) , the symmetry relations ( [ c_sym_coupled ] ) and ( [ t_sym_coupled ] ) are transformed into @xmath193 as is easily verified , these relations are obeyed by the gorkov hamiltonian of equation ( [ h_canonical ] ) .    in summary",
    ", we distinguish between two choices of basis , and hence between two ways of writing the hamiltonian .",
    "both have their respective advantages and disadvantages , and depending on the given context we will use one or the other , whichever is better suited .",

    "if the inter - node scattering in @xmath195 is negligibly weak , the four low - energy sectors decouple , and then the two individual operations in ( [ ct_sym_iso ] ) , both of which relate nodes to their conjugates , become ineffective .",
    "what remains effective is an operation relating each isolated node to itself . by applying the symmetries @xmath176 and @xmath177 in sequence ,",

    "( the latter follows more directly from the basic equation ( [ hath ] ) ) .",
    "given the presence of disorder , no further symmetries are expected .",

    "indeed , looking at , say , the first two terms , and noting that @xmath257 and @xmath258 are just complex numbers , we see that a local transformation @xmath259 where @xmath260 and @xmath261 , leaves the action functional invariant . because @xmath262 comprise two commuting and two anticommuting components , the invertible supermatrix @xmath89 is of size @xmath263 .",

    "there exists a standard formula @xcite to use for that purpose , which refers to the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the perturbating operators .",

    "notice the following features :    * the beta functions contain no terms of linear order in the couplings , which expresses the fact that we are dealing with a set of marginal perturbations .",
    "* in the physical regime of positive couplings , the beta functions are never negative , so none of the couplings decreases under the rg flow . *",
    "none of the couplings supports its own flow .",
    "in particular , for the model with only forward scattering ( @xmath320 ) the coupling constant @xmath32 is truly marginal . * for generic initial data , the nature of the flow is marginally relevant , i.e. the couplings ( save for the constant @xmath321 ) increase under the flow , although the _ rate _ of increase vanishes in the limit of weak disorder @xmath322 .",
    "* the anisotropy parameter @xmath18 does not enter the one - loop rg equations .",
    "the fact that the anisotropy has disappeared from the rg equations can be understood heuristically as follows .",
    "the ope scheme for the set @xmath323 encodes the one - loop renormalization of the four - fermion vertices of the theory .",
    "these vertices are related to the fermion self energy through a ward identity . to explore the effects of the anisotropy ,",
    "one may therefore directly analyse the self - energy diagrams .",
    "the latter have been shown @xcite to be unaffected by the anisotropy , to leading ( or one - loop ) order .",
    "the physical reason is that the first - order self energy diagram measures the born scattering rate between the four low - energy sectors .",
    "this rate is not affected by the ellipsoidal shape ( expressing the anisotropy ) of the low - energy lobes in momentum space ; it only depends on the total phase volume available . in higher orders of perturbation theory , the situation changes and the self energy begins to be affected by the anisotropy in momentum space .",
    "in particular , higher - order scattering between neighbouring nodes is suppressed @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we expect that the beta functions at higher loop orders do depend on the anisotropy of the model .",
    "let us stress two messages that emerge from the current section : ( i ) owing to the quadratic dependence of the beta functions on their arguments , the rg flow is marginal ( or very slow ) in the limit of small couplings ( or weak disorder ) , and ( ii ) for generic values of the disorder - generated couplings , the renormalization group flow drives the system away from the free - fermion theory . in combination with the phenomenological input that the inter - node couplings @xmath159 are small as compared to the intra - node coupling @xmath32 , the first message leads us to expect a prolonged crossover intervening between a ballistic regime at short scales , and the diffusive regime governed by a non - linear sigma model at large scales .",
    "anticipating that a direct perturbative analysis of the theory ( [ l_average ] ) will not capture all of the important physics , one is tempted to employ the `` standard '' scheme for dealing with weakly disordered non - interacting particles : hubbard - stratonovich transformation followed by a saddle - point analysis and gradient expansion .",
    "it turns out , however , that this approach is beset with a number of problems , none of which appears in systems with a non - relativistic kinetic energy .",
    "these difficulties will eventually force us to adopt a strategy where elements of the standard scheme are supplemented , and even superseded , by an alternative scheme tailored to relativistic fermions : non - abelian bosonization .    for pedagogical reasons",
    ", we will here proceed in a conservative fashion and continue somewhat further along the much - trodden path ( hubbard - stratonovich transformation and so on ) , introducing along the way a few concepts of general validity .",
    "in particular , we will identify the degrees of freedom of the hierarchy of low - energy effective theories , and the way they are associated with the global symmetries discussed in section [ sec : symmetries_ft ] . as a by - product",
    ", we will be able to make the connection to previous self - consistent approaches .    to begin with ,",

    "we mention in passing that it can be understood at this stage why the restriction to equally distributed disorder in the normal and order parameter channels makes no essential difference : one can relax this assumption by introducing two more hubbard - stratonovich fields , @xmath330 and @xmath331 , coupling to the ph matrices @xmath283 and @xmath332 , respectively .",
    "on varying the action with respect to these fields , one finds that they vanish on the saddle - point level . since a non - vanishing saddle point is a necessary condition for the formation of goldstone modes , which control the infrared behaviour",
    ", we conclude that these fields and hence the choice of ( un)equally distributed disorder , are of no importance .    with the aim of subjecting the functional integral to a stationary - phase analysis",
    ", we now vary the action with respect to the fields @xmath51 and @xmath326 to generate a set of saddle - point equations .",
    "we first look for solutions @xmath333 that are diagonal in both nodal and internal space . for vanishing energy @xmath76 ,",
    "the solutions are @xmath334 where the real parameter @xmath335 is defined implicitly through @xmath336 this equation , which can be regarded as the dirac analog of the scba equation for disordered normal - conducting systems ( with @xmath337 representing the self energy ) , has been discussed in the literature ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "however , as we know from experience with disordered normal - conducting systems , there exists much physics that does not unfold at the saddle - point level , but resides in the fluctuations of @xmath51 .",
    "the same is true here .",
    "the saddle point @xmath342 breaks the symmetry @xmath343 for class @xmath170 as recorded in the table at the end of section [ sec : symmetries_ft ] . by the goldstone mechanism",
    ", this leads to the appearance of massless modes , and one expects that it is the fluctuations in these `` soft '' modes , rather than any single saddle point , that determines the behaviour of the system at large scales or low energies .    let us therefore ask what happens when the functional integral @xmath344 $ ] is subjected to a global symmetry transformation taken from @xmath343 .",
    "( as we saw , the symmetry is actually _ local _ , but we should hesitate to draw any conclusions from that , as the axial part of the symmetry is anomalous ; see appendix [ chiral_anomaly ] ) .",

    "the appearance of a chiral symmetry group @xmath353 ( still maintaining the focus on a single nodal sector ) , with independent left and right factors , is directly connected with the _ oddness _ of the hamiltonian under conjugation by @xmath197 in ph space : @xmath354 .",

    "was recently rediscovered by senthil et al .",
    "* according to nersesyan , tsvelik , and wenger @xcite , the effect of impurity scattering on an isolated node of a @xmath0-wave superconductor is described by a non - linear sigma model ( more precisely , by a wzw model ) on @xmath30 .",
    "we will discuss a supersymmetric variant of that model in some detail later . * the non - linear sigma model with target manifold @xmath380 was identified as the low - energy effective theory for dirty @xmath0-wave superconductors in class @xmath8 by senthil et al .",
    "the supersymmetric extension of that theory had appeared in @xcite ( to describe the physics of low - energy quasi - particle excitations in disordered superconductor / normal metal junctions ) and @xcite ( as a description of quasi - particles in the core of a disordered vortex . ) * the appearance of the wigner - dyson class of unitary symmetry ( class @xmath9 ) for @xmath0-wave superconductors in the mixed state is implicit to several recent papers @xcite .",
    "the merit of the present work is that it assembles the various symmetry classes and field theories into a single coherent scheme .",
    "after this extensive tour of symmetries and their field - theoretical realization , we are now ready to attack the concrete goal of giving a bona fide construction of the low - energy effective theories . equipped with a strong background in the supersymmetric theory of disordered metals , one would deem the strategy to follow quite obvious : one should decompose the hubbard - stratonovich fields @xmath381 into goldstone ( or massless ) modes @xmath42 and a complementary set of massive modes .",
    "one would then integrate over the latter in gaussian approximation and , finally , expand to lowest order in the gradients @xmath382 , measuring the energy cost due to spatial variations in the massless fields .",
    "it came as a surprise to us that this program is corrupted by two sources of severe difficulty :    * in the course of carrying out the gradient expansion we are confronted with a two - dimensional version of the chiral anomaly ( see appendix [ chiral_anomaly ] ) .",
    "* for the physically interesting limit of systems with @xmath383-invariance and forward scattering only ( class @xmath170 ) , we are unable to isolate and eliminate the massive fields in a controlled manner .",

    "this , however , is a surmountable problem ; once the nature of the anomaly has been understood , a less naive and properly regularized expansion scheme can be set up to yield the correct answer .",
    "the second problem is more serious .",
    "its origin is that dirac fermions are perturbed by a random abelian vector potential ( which is the concrete form taken by the disorder in the present realization of class @xmath384 ) in a truly marginal way .",
    "what this means is that the system retains the conformal invariance of the free - fermion theory , with _ no mass scale _ being generated . as a result ,",

    "are fully included , ( ii ) the dependence of the wzw action on orientation is accounted for , and ( iii ) the physics of the crossover regimes in between the limiting cases of hard and soft scattering is included .",
    "we will begin by reviewing a few elements of the general bosonization approach to supersymmetric theories , and then discuss the application of these concepts to the case at hand .",
    "originally , non - abelian bosonization was introduced to construct bosonic representations of relativistic two - dimensional fermion models with continuous internal symmetries @xcite .",
    "more recently , the approach has been extended @xcite to the supersymmetric case of relativistic fermions supplemented by a bosonic ghost system , which is the setup needed to treat problems with disorder .",
    "below we will review some elements of this approach , in a form tailored to the @xmath0-wave application .",
    "readers who are familiar with bosonization will find that there are no structural differences to the original , fermionic version .",
    "readers who are not may wish to consult first an introduction to standard non - abelian bosonization , e.g.  witten s original and highly pedagogical article @xcite .",
    "a detailed account of the principal supersymmetric extension of the approach can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    before turning to the problem of the @xmath0-wave superconductor ,",

    "it is implicitly assumed that the existence of the functional integral is ensured by the presence of some convergence generating term in the action .",
    "( for an explicit example of such a term , see below . )    furthermore , let @xmath42 be a field taking values in the ( anomalous ) symmetry group of @xmath389 , which is the complex supergroup @xmath396 of matrices fulfilling @xmath397 , with the matrix operation @xmath398 defined by @xmath399 .",

    "the phrase `` equivalent '' here means that , with the transcription @xmath403 understood , the two functional integrals @xmath400 and @xmath404 produce identical results .    following witten , an explicit expression for @xmath405",

    "the reason is that the invariant metric @xmath417 on this group , as on any complex group , is not riemannian .",
    "this in turn implies that a functional integral controlled by the metric term @xmath418 can not be defined by an unrestricted integration over @xmath416 .",
    "( this term has indefinite sign , which spoils the convergence of the integral . ) for ordinary groups the obvious remedy is to restrict the complex group to a compact real subgroup ; one passes , for example , from @xmath419 to @xmath420 .",

    "@xcite , we here merely mention that the bb sector of this manifold is given by the non - compact coset space @xmath422 , while the ff sector is the compact group @xmath423 .",
    "we next apply this general apparatus to the @xmath0-wave system .",
    "firstly , it is necessary to cast the free action @xmath424 ( we here set @xmath425 ) of the system into the form of the action @xmath389 above . to this end",

    "we first discuss the case where inter - node scattering is present , and is strong . by construction of the bosonized theory ,",

    ", we emphasize that the cancellation of wzw terms is a robust feature that does not depend on any specific model assumptions made ( as long as the disorder is generic , placing the model in class @xmath167 ) .",
    "the basic mechanism behind the cancellation is the dependence of the wzw term on parity or , equivalently , the choice of orientation of two - dimensional space : its sign gets reversed by the transformation @xmath470 .",
    "although this dependence by itself does not forbid the presence of a wzw term for parity - invariant systems ( as the sign change can be absorbed by a target space isometry @xmath471 ) , it does so for a @xmath0-wave superconductor in zero magnetic field .",
    "the crucial fact here is that the pure dirac hamiltonians for the two pairs of nodes @xmath251 correspond to _ opposite _ orientations ( they map onto each other by the transformation @xmath472 ) .",
    "therefore , in the bosonized theory they are represented by wzw actions with topological coupling constants that _ still carry opposite signs _ , provided that uniform conventions for assigning dirac bilinears to wzw fields are in force .",

    "this was done for notational convenience . ) when any kind of scattering ( consistent with the generic symmetries of the system ) between neighbouring nodes is turned on , the two wzw fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 become locked in the low - energy theory , now by @xmath36 , and the topological couplings with differing signs inevitably add up to zero .",
    "the model ( [ nlsm_dc ] ) , with the wzw term being absent , is called the principal chiral non - linear sigma model on @xmath35 ( more precisely , on a riemannian symmetric superspace of type @xmath44 , which is a supermanifold based on the direct product of the non - compact space @xmath473 with the compact group @xmath474 ) . referring for a more detailed discussion of its replica analog to ref .",
    "@xcite , we here review only one salient feature of this theory . according to friedan @xcite ,",
    "the one - loop beta function of any 2d non - linear model is determined by the ricci curvature of the target manifold . for symmetric superspaces , just like for ordinary symmetric spaces ,",
    "the ricci curvature is proportional to the metric tensor , and in the present case is easily shown to be positive @xcite .",
    "this means that the beta function is positive , and the coupling @xmath475 therefore increases under renormalization . by plausible extrapolation to strong coupling @xmath476",
    ", one then expects the theory to be in an insulating phase with vanishing ( spin ) conductance @xmath477 .",
    "this phase was named the `` spin insulator '' in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the local density of states @xmath478 of the spin insulator is predicted to vanish linearly , @xmath479 , at ultra - low energies , by a scaling argument due to senthil and fisher @xcite . on the basis of the supersymmetric field theory ( [ nlsm_dc ] )",
    ", we can phrase the argument as follows .",
    "the growth of the coupling @xmath480 under renormalization means that , while there is asymptotic freedom ( accompanied only by small field fluctuations ) at short scales , the fluctuations of @xmath42 grow strong for large wave lengths .",
    "the scale for crossover from weak to strong coupling is set by the localization length , @xmath481 @xcite .",
    "let us therefore partition the system into blocks of linear size @xmath148 . to mimic the crossover between short - range order and long - range disorder , we take the fields on different blocks to be independent , and on each individual block to be spatially constant . by doing the field integral in this simple approximation",
    "we find @xmath482 where @xmath483 is the scba density of states , which depends only weakly on energy , and the scaling function @xmath484 ( with asymptotic limit @xmath485 ) has the small-@xmath486 expansion @xmath487 .",
    "thus the local density of states goes to zero linearly at @xmath245 , with the characteristic energy scale being given by @xmath488 , the level spacing for one localization volume .",
    "we now set the inter - node couplings @xmath489 to zero .",
    "what then remains is the free - fermion theory , as represented by the sum of wzw actions @xmath436",
    "+ w[m_2]$ ] , marginally perturbed by the operator @xmath490 .",
    "two observations simplify the analysis of this theory .",
    "firstly , we may omit the term @xmath491 when calculating the density of states .",
    "the physical reason is that in the absence of inter - node coupling we can project on one pair of nodes , say @xmath251 , and take the other one into account by multiplying the final answer with a factor of 2 .",
    "thus , we may set @xmath492 and drop the field @xmath21 .",
    "alternatively , the reduction can be seen by reasoning within the field - theoretical formulation , where it comes about because the functional integral giving the contribution to the density of states from the pair @xmath251 has an invariance under brst transformations acting in the sector @xmath252 . secondly , we may rescale the coordinates to make the field theory isotropic .",
    "we are then facing an isotropic wzw model with a current - current perturbation : @xmath493 + g \\int d^2r\\,{\\rm str}(\\tau_3 j)\\ , { \\rm str}(\\tau_3\\bar j)\\;.     \\label{aiii_osp}\\ ] ] from our earlier computation of the rg beta functions we know that the coupling constant @xmath32 does not flow .",
    "this can be verified directly from the wzw model by observing that the ope of the abelian current @xmath494 with itself does not generate any uv singularities .",
    "thus the above action is a fixed point for the renormalization group , and the theory is conformally invariant .",
    "what are its properties ?",
    "a quick approach to the answer is to recall that the physical problem we are dealing with here is the much studied @xcite problem of dirac fermions in a random abelian vector potential .",
    "this problem can doubtless be analysed via the above action based on @xmath265 . unfortunately ,",
    "that formulation does not seem to be the most efficient one to use and , in any case , it is not the one used in related previous work . what forced us to introduce the @xmath265 target space was the fact that we do not know of any other way of bosonizing the perturbations that couple the neighbouring nodes .",
    "in the present problem , however , where the coupling between the nodes is absent , the symmetry group consists of two copies of @xmath22 , the subgroup of elements @xmath370 of @xmath265 with the property @xmath495 .",
    "the excess of field degrees of freedom in @xmath265 , as compared to @xmath22 , means that there is some redundancy .",
    "an efficient method of solution will try to avoid this redundancy , and can avoid it as follows .    in standard non - abelian bosonization ( without bosonic ghosts ) , two schemes are distinguished : bosonization takes the free - fermion theory into a level - one wzw model either over the orthogonal group @xmath496 , or over the unitary group @xmath497 . while the two bosonization schemes are equivalent in the free limit , the @xmath496 version has the advantage of exposing the _ full _ set of symmetries of the free theory of @xmath293 dirac fermions ( or @xmath498 majorana fermions ) , whereas the @xmath497 version is better adapted to the treatment of certain perturbations .",
    "the latter scheme was developed particularly by affleck @xcite in his treatment of the 1d hubbard and heisenberg models .    by straightforward transcription of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can generalize the @xmath497 bosonization scheme to include a bosonic ghost system .",
    "the resulting theory is again a supersymmetric wzw model , with an action functional of the same form as before , but the field now takes values in the supergroup @xmath22 ( or , rather , in a riemannian symmetric superspace of type @xmath16 inside @xmath275 ) . deferring the details of this generalization to appendix [ sec : cft ] , we here take a short cut .",
    "to arrive at the bosonized theory in the desired form , we start from the action functional ( [ aiii_osp ] ) and simply insert for @xmath20 the reduced expression @xmath499 where @xmath500 is parametrized , for example , by @xmath501 the action functional for @xmath42 then becomes @xmath41 & = & -{1 \\over 8\\pi } \\int d^2r\\,{\\rm str}\\,\\partial_\\mu m^{-1 }    \\partial_\\mu m + { i \\gamma[m ] \\over 12\\pi } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & { g\\over      \\pi^2 } \\int d^2r\\,{\\rm str } ( m^{-1 } \\partial m)\\ , { \\rm str } ( m    \\bar\\partial m^{-1 } ) \\;.    \\label{marg_line}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the same result is obtained by direct application of the @xmath275 bosonization rules to the supersymmetric dirac theory with the marginal perturbation @xmath502 .",
    "the numerical ( or bosonic ) part of this action has the important property of being bounded from below ( for @xmath32 not in excess of a certain critical value ) , and hence leads to a well - defined functional integral .",

    "it goes without saying that a parity - invariant theory can not generate pseudoscalar observables . on these grounds ,",

    "this invariance means that @xmath588 and @xmath589 give equivalent field theories for the case of a closed system .",
    "thus , although @xmath585 is a pseudoscalar , the nonlinear sigma model at @xmath590 enjoys the property of being parity - invariant , and there does not exist any conflict with the parity invariance of the massless dirac theory ( or the wzw model ) .    at the same time , it would be a preposterous proposition to claim that pruisken s nonlinear sigma model for the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) at @xmath590 describes a parity - invariant physical system with vanishing hall response !",
    "how do we then reconcile parity invariance at @xmath590 with iqhe phenomenology ?",

    "this feature of the hall conductivity , which distinguishes it from the longitudinal conductivity @xmath592 , poses a difficulty to the nonlinear sigma model formulation : since the field theory is derived for a fixed energy , all the information needed to reconstruct the hall response in the bulk can not be contained in it . in other words , the topological coupling @xmath585 of the nonlinear sigma model does not coincide with the total hall conductivity of the bulk , and hence the parity invariance of the field theory at @xmath590 does not imply that the hall response of the quantum hall system vanishes .    nonetheless , as was pointed out by pruisken @xcite , it is possible to monitor the hall response field - theoretically by studying systems that have a _",
    "boundary_. there exist chiral boundary currents at the edges of quantum hall systems , and the topological term of the nonlinear sigma model ( for a fixed energy @xmath591 ) does capture the physics of these boundary currents .",
    "in fact , when a boundary is present , the invariance under shifts @xmath593 no longer holds , parity symmetry is broken for all nonzero values of @xmath585 including @xmath590 , and the topological term gives rise to long - range current - current correlations at the edges of the system .",
    "the message from this is that , in order to get an unambiguous field - theoretic view of thermal and spin hall transport in a @xmath0-wave superconductor , we are well advised to consider geometries with a boundary .",
    "having understood that , we run into another difficulty : a consistent extension of a _ single _ wzw model to a system with boundaries is not possible !",
    "instead , a geometric construction detailed in appendix [ sec : wzw - theory - systems ] will show the following :    * the modeling of a system @xmath73 with boundary @xmath594 requires , at least , _ two _ wzw fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 . * these fields",
    "are coupled at the boundary through a condition @xmath595 ( plus additional conditions on the derivatives of the fields to ensure current conservation . )",
    "this mechanism reflects the fact that specular reflection at the boundaries of a finite systems couples quasi - particle species of different parity .",
    "( specular reflection inverts _ one _ of the momentum components while leaving the other invariant : a parity operation . ) * as far as the hall conductivity of the coupled system is concerned , everything depends on the _ masses _ @xmath596 of the two field species : ( i ) if both fields are massless , they enter the theory with equal weight and the hall conductivity vanishes by symmetry .",

    "which field has become heavy , and the sign of @xmath596 .",
    "finally , ( iii ) if the masses @xmath598 are approximately equal , it is the signs of @xmath596 that determine the hall conductivity .",
    "if the signs are the same , we expect to get @xmath599 ; if they differ , we expect @xmath600 .    what can we infer from these observations about the problem at hand ? recall that the two pairs of conjugate nodes @xmath601 and @xmath252 are represented by the wzw fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , with our conventions being such that the total wzw term is @xmath468 + \\gamma[m_2]$ ] .",
    "given these low - energy effective fields , we impose the boundary condition @xmath602 .",
    "( alternatively , the boundary conditions could mix in high - energy fields corresponding to excited quasi - particle bands of the superconductor . ) from what we said before , this boundary condition is forced by the requirement that the wzw functional be mathematically well - defined .",
    "if the parity invariance of the microscopic hamiltonian is broken by the presence of a magnetic field in the form of vortices and by the supercurrent flow , there exists no fundamental symmetry principle that would protect the fields from acquiring ( small ) masses @xmath596 in the low - energy effective theory .",
    "more detailed analysis would then be required to decide which scenario ( i - iii ) applies in the case of a realistic @xmath0-wave superconductor ( for the most complete investigation to date , see @xcite ) . however , as far as theory is concerned , let us re - iterate that the wzw model and the original dirac fermion model represent equivalent descriptions of the system . in view of the consistency problems outlined above , and",
    "their resolution by an extended theory , one expects that a faithful description of hall transport in the dirac fermion language , too , has to involve _ all _ four nodal fermion species simultaneously .",
    "therefore , symmetry - based statements that the hall conductivity of a _ single _ dirac fermion system vanishes@xcite should be taken with a grain of salt .    to avoid confusion , we elaborate on one other subtle point that may seem paradoxical . recall that what we set out to calculate was the single - particle green function , giving the density of states .",
    "since the field theory we have derived for it contains massless ( goldstone ) fields @xmath51 , one might be misled into thinking that our theory predicts singular corrections to the density of states . in the present instance , this is not so .",
    "the reason why we obtained massless fields is that , in the course of the derivation , we chose to carry out a _ doubling _ of field variables ( introducing charge conjugation space , so as to accommodate the symplectic symmetry of the gorkov hamiltonian , which becomes important as soon as the coupling between nodes is turned on ) .",
    "this means that we are effectively working in the two - particle sector .",
    "put differently , the present theory involves _ all _ of the fields for the nodes @xmath251 , although the basic quasi - particle hamiltonian connects only half of them . as a result , when we compute the density of states the source fields couple only to a subset of the grassmann fields .",
    "thus there is a global fermionic symmetry , which causes the field integral to collapse by the usual brst mechanism and yield a vanishing correction to the density of states .",
    "the field theory stays alive only for the two - particle green function , viz .",
    "transport .      the final case to consider is the simultaneous presence of inter - node scattering and breaking of time - reversal invariance .",
    "having switched to the @xmath22 bosonization scheme for convenience of presentation and solution in the previous two subsections , we must now return to the more general @xmath265 scheme in order to accommodate the inter - node couplings .",
    "the t - breaking perturbation by a supercurrent flow is rewritten in terms of @xmath603 as @xmath604 by the @xmath265 bosonization rules , this bosonizes to @xmath605 now recall that the effect of inter - node scattering is to lock the fields ( @xmath469 ) and to reduce @xmath20 to a scalar in node space , @xmath606 with @xmath363 . inserting this expression for @xmath20 and using @xmath607 , we find that the perturbation disappears .",
    "thus , in the linear approximation used here , the breaking of time - reversal symmetry by the supercurrent flow ceases to be effective in the node - locked limit .    while this may seem surprising at first , it is not hard to comprehend in physical terms .",
    "the perturbation we are considering represents the doppler shift due to the motion of quasi - particles relative to the supercurrent flow @xmath608 .",
    "because the node @xmath609 and its conjugate @xmath610 are located at opposite momenta , the corresponding quasi - particle states experience opposite doppler shifts .",
    "therefore , scattering between opposite notes causes the doppler effect to alternate randomly in time .",
    "it is clear that the node - locked limit will be attained over scales large enough in order for a quasi - particle to undergo many scattering events between the nodes . on such scales , and in modes of long - range quantum interference that are stable with respect to disorder averaging , the doppler shift averages to zero .",
    "however , this does _ not _ mean that the presence of the supercurrent flow is of no consequence . at the free - fermion point ,",
    "the field @xmath42 has scaling dimension one , which makes the perturbation ( [ vs_pert ] ) more relevant in the rg sense than the marginal perturbations that represent inter - node scattering .",
    "( precisely speaking , this is true only for wave lengths smaller than the spacing between vortices . on large scales ,",
    "the spatial oscillations of the supercurrent velocity cause the perturbation to average to zero . )",
    "we should therefore evaluate the consequences of the perturbation ( [ vs_pert ] ) _ before _ locking the nodes .",
    "doing so , and appealing to the same argument as in the previous subsection , we expect the perturbation ( [ vs_pert ] ) to reduce the field @xmath439",
    "( @xmath611 ) to stationary - phase manifolds which now are given by @xmath612 with @xmath613 , the diagonal subgroup of the chiral symmetry group of the @xmath415 wzw model .",
    "next , we take the effects of inter - node scattering into account ( with the plausible assumption that reduction of the field manifold does not change the relevant nature of the perturbations from inter - node scattering . ) by the mechanism described in section [ sec : hard , t ] , the fields will be locked : @xmath614 where @xmath89 now belongs to the other variant of @xmath35 ( orthogonal bosons , symplectic fermions ) . by inserting the locked fields into the wzw action , we arrive at a non - linear sigma model with action @xmath615 = - { 1",

    "note that in the linear order of approximation used , there is no topological theta term in this non - linear sigma model .",
    "precisely the same field theory ( without a definite value for the coupling @xmath480 ) was obtained in @xcite from a more phenomenological approach .",
    "the known physics of this system is a zeeman - field dependent weak - localization correction to the thermal conductivity @xcite , and a density of states that vanishes as @xmath616 at ultra - low energies @xcite .    rather than elaborating on these properties",
    ", we turn to another way of breaking time - reversal symmetry , which is to make the order parameter of the superconductor _ complex _ by including an imaginary component .",
    "motivated by recent developments that were reviewed in the introduction , we consider an @xmath48 component with momentum dependence @xmath617 . in the gorkov hamiltonian ,",
    "such a term enters as the pauli matrix @xmath332 acting in particle - hole space .",
    "if we again rotate by @xmath618 and linearize around the nodes , the term becomes proportional to @xmath197 and acts as a dirac mass term , with the mass parameter being positive for one pair of nodes , say @xmath251 , and negative for the other pair . in the field theory , upon bosonization , the perturbation is represented by the operator @xmath619 which is relevant at the free - fermion point .",
    "the observation we made earlier for the case of a supercurrent flow applies here as well : if we assume the limit of locked fields @xmath620 , the perturbation vanishes .",
    "this is again plausible , since the dirac masses resulting from @xmath621 carry opposite signs for neighbouring nodes , which , as we recall , transform into each other by @xmath622 or @xmath623 .",
    "hence the dirac mass of a quasi - particle subject to inter - node scattering is zero on average .",
    "as before , however , the correct procedure is first to deal with the relevant mass perturbation , and only then to impose field locking .",
    "proceeding in this way , we would again be led to the action ( [ nlsm_d3c1 ] ) for the low - energy effective theory .",
    "we should , however , be suspicious of the last result , as it does not conform with what is expected on symmetry grounds .",
    "the point is that the action of the non - linear sigma model ( [ nlsm_d3c1 ] ) is invariant under a parity transformation @xmath624 and @xmath625 , whereas the perturbed wzw theory we are starting from is not . indeed ,",
    "if we combine the parity transformation with field inversion @xmath626 , so as to preserve the wzw action , the sign of the perturbation gets reversed : @xmath627 where the last equality follows from @xmath628 and the fact that @xmath371 is odd under the orthosymplectic transpose defined by @xmath629 .",
    "thus , parity is broken in the initial theory , and it is reasonable to expect that it will still be broken in the final theory .    as was first pointed out by pruisken et al .",
    "@xcite in the related context of the integer quantum hall effect , the way to break parity invariance in the non - linear sigma model is to add a theta term with topological angle @xmath630 to the action . from what has been said ,",
    "we expect such a term in the low - energy effective action when a secondary @xmath45 component of the order parameter is present . to compute the angle @xmath571 , we abandon non - abelian bosonization and revert to the standard method : hubbard - stratonovich transformation and saddle - point approximation , followed by a gradient expansion .",
    "( note that , although non - abelian bosonization is perfectly suited to describe the flow of the field theory away from the free - fermion point , it is a less reliable tool for understanding how the theory arrives at and flows into the non - linear sigma model . )",
    "the last step is readily performed using the method of heat kernel regularization reviewed in appendix [ sec : heatkernel ] . as a result",
    "we obtain the action presented in eq .",
    "( [ nlsm_diiici ] ) , with couplings @xmath631 a summary of the physics of this model , and references to the relevant literature , were given in the introduction .",
    "in this section , we comment on the second controversy mentioned in the introduction : the incompatibility of field theory and self - consistent approaches .",
    "several arguments have been put forward to explain the existence of conflicting results for observables as basic as the mean dos ( finite at zero energy in the self - consistent approaches , vanishing in field theory ) .",
    "it has , for example , been argued that the vanishing of the dos in field theory might be due to an ill - defined continuum limit @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the notorious appearance of logarithmic divergences in the diagrammatic results hints at an insufficient uv - regularization . however , in hindsight it looks like these , uv related aspects of the problem carry minor if any significance .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy between field theory and early self diagrammatic aproaches to the problem lies somewhere else :    first of all , it is important to realize that the vanishing of the dos obtained in the field - theoretical description is due to a mechanism which can simply not be included into diagrammatic approaches .",
    "indeed , we have seen in section [ sec : proceed ] that the breaking of the chiral symmetry of the hamiltonian on the saddle - point level leads to the appearance of goldstone modes . in early perturbative approaches to the problem  @xcite",
    ", these modes had not been included at all . in the field theory , however , they are responsible for much of the physical behaviour of the system . in particular , it is the strong fluctuation of these modes in low - dimensional systems that leads to a vanishing of the dos at @xmath632 .",
    "it is tempting to explain this vanishing by the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem as was done by ntw .",
    "indeed , a non - vanishing dos would have meant that a continuous symmetry of the field theory was spontaneously broken .",
    "( as with normal disordered systems , the dos plays the role of an order parameter in the field theory . )",
    "the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem essentially states that , as a consequence of unbounded goldstone mode fluctuations , spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry does not occur in dimensions @xmath633 .",
    "there is , however , a caveat with that argument , which is that the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem explicitly refers to _ compact field manifolds_. in the non - perturbative supersymmetry approach at hand , we are _ not _ dealing with such types of field manifold .",
    "this is not an academic point , as is shown by counterexamples : there exist cases , namely two - dimensional systems in class @xmath70 or @xmath70iii , where the naive application of the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem leads to the erroneous prediction of a vanishing dos .",
    "( the non - linear sigma model for weakly disordered 2d systems in these classes predicts a zero - energy dos which diverges in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . ) however , for the systems in the classes @xmath9iii , @xmath8i , and @xmath8 studied in the present paper , the inclusion of the goldstone modes indeed leads to a vanishing dos .",
    "it is very instructive to explore the phenomenon in the zero - dimensional case ( i.e.  the case of ergodic systems , where spatial fluctuations of the goldstone modes are frozen out . )",
    "the reason why @xmath634 is a good case to study is that the zero - dimensional non - linear sigma model integral can be performed explicitly ( c.f .",
    ", e.g. , ref .",
    "it turns out that the results , including the vanishing of the dos at zero energy , agree with the phenomenological random - matrix theory approach to systems of class @xmath8 , @xmath8i , and @xmath9iii @xcite .",
    "moreover , the simplicity of the @xmath635-case makes it particularly straightforward to deduce what is missing in the diagrammatic approach .",
    "after all , it can not be that perturbative diagrammatic approaches are completely oblivious to the existence of the goldstone modes mentioned above .",
    "in fact , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that relevant classes of diagrams are missed within the scba approach to computing the green function .",
    "`` relevant '' here means that the diagrams in question diverge as the energy approaches zero .",
    "this behaviour is indicative of the fact that these diagram classes represent the perturbative implementation of the goldstone modes discussed above ( very much like the standard diffuson mode is the first - order perturbative contribution to the goldstone modes induced by the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry between retarded and advanced green functions for disordered metals ) .",
    "more recent diagrammatic approaches@xcite have included these modes into the perturbative theory of the disordered @xmath0-wave superconductor . in intermediate energy regimes , where the ir singularity of the goldstone modes has not yet become virulent , the extended diagrammatic formulation represents an alternative to the field - theoretical approach .    summarizing",
    ", we find that ( i ) the inclusion of goldstone modes is crucial for a correct description of the quasi - particles of a @xmath0-wave superconductor ( in particular its dos ) , ( ii ) that within diagrammatics these modes are represented by singular diagram classes which ( iii ) can be brought under control in intermediate , but not in the lowest energy regimes .",
    "finally we comment on work where a non - vanishing zero - energy dos has been obtained in a non - perturbative manner .",
    "in particular , lee @xcite considered the dos on the background of an ensemble of impurities at the unitarity limit . the strength of these impurities makes a comparison with our analysis difficult .",
    "( the construction of the field theory crucially relies on the existence of a parametric separation between the energetic extension of the nodal region and the much smaller width of the disorder distribution . )",
    "another type of non - perturbative approach has been put forward by ziegler , hettler and hirschfeld @xcite . in their work ,",
    "a non - vanishing dos was obtained on the basis of rigorous estimates applied to the single - particle green function . upon close inspection , however , their line of reasoning can be dismissed by its lack of relevance for superconductors .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian they consider is extremely special and non - generic in class @xmath167 .",
    "it is formulated on a lattice and , in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , reads @xmath636 where the kinetic energy @xmath637 and the non - local @xmath0-wave order parameter @xmath638 are taken to act by @xmath639 and @xmath98 is a random chemical potential .",
    "the choice for @xmath640 has the artificial feature that it allows hopping only between _ third - nearest _ neighbours , which leads to a conservation law alien to superconductors : @xmath178 commutes with the operator @xmath641 , where @xmath642 multiplies by plus one on the sites of an @xmath9 sublattice ( @xmath643 even ) and by minus one on the sites of the @xmath161 sublattice ( @xmath643 odd ) .",
    "since @xmath641 has two eigenvalues @xmath644 , the hilbert space decomposes into two sectors not coupled by @xmath178 .",
    "the first one consists of all particle states on the @xmath9 sublattice and hole states on the @xmath161 sublattice , while the second sector contains all the complementary states . without loss of generality",
    "we may restrict the hamiltonian to one sector .",
    "the particle - hole degree of freedom then becomes redundant  we can make a particle - hole transformation on the @xmath161 sites , so that the first sector becomes all particles and the second sector all holes  and the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath645 where @xmath646 denotes the restriction of @xmath647 to the @xmath9 sublattice .",
    "@xmath648 is a generalized discrete laplacian augmented by a random potential .",
    "it belongs to the symmetry class @xmath649 , the wigner - dyson class with @xmath650 , which is to say that the hamiltonian matrix is real symmetric , and the large - scale behaviour of its two - particle green s function is controlled by the cooperon and diffuson modes well known from the theory of disordered metals .",
    "there exist _ no _ quantum interference modes affecting the single - particle green s function .",
    "thus the quasi - particle hamiltonian of ziegler , hettler and hirschfeld models a time - reversal invariant _ normal metal _ rather than a superconductor !",
    "as one would expect , it can be proved @xcite that such a hamiltonian has a non - zero density of states at @xmath245 for a wide class of distributions of the random potential @xmath98 .",

    ", we conclude that the zhh model provides no test of the accuracy of the self - consistent @xmath89-matrix approximation widely used for superconductors .",
    "to preclude any misunderstanding , let us emphasize that the zhh model is built on a superfluid condensate , which may of course exhibit the meissner effect and other phenomena associated with superconductivity .",
    "however , the issue at hand is not the nature of charge transport by the superconducting condensate .",

    "the low - energy theory in this case belongs to a one - parameter family of fixed points , each identified through a different value of the disorder - coupling strength .",
    "this is reflected in a low - energy density of states which varies with energy as a power law with an exponent that depends on the strength of disorder .",
    "experimentally , the relevant scattering phenomenology is likely to be somewhere in between the cases considered above : at intermediate energy scales , signatures of the critical theory may well be visible in thermal transport measurements , although the behaviour at very low energies must , ultimately , be that of the spin insulator .",
    "the collapse of the critical theory in the presence of strong disorder was attributed to a cancellation of the multi - valued wzw terms arising from the different nodal sectors of the theory .",
    "in fact , such cancellations are guaranteed by symmetry to occur in lattice models which exhibit a dirac - node structure at the fermi level ( such as the random @xmath669-flux model ) . in such lattice models ,",
    "the nodes arise in pairs related by parity . under the same parity transformation ,",
    "the wzw term is mapped onto a partner with opposite sign .",
    "therefore , when the fields belonging to each nodal sector are locked by strong disorder , the different wzw terms add and cancel pairwise .    finally , the formalism developed and investigated above is not entirely specific to @xmath0-wave superconductors .",
    "the global structures of the theory relied only on the existence of a dirac - like spectrum of the clean system .",

    "to complement our derivation of the effective action for the soft - scattering limit from non - abelian bosonization , we include here a derivation of the same action from the gradient expansion .",
    "the motivation is largely of pedagogical nature : to facilitate comparison with existing works in the literature on weakly disordered fermion systems , it is useful to present more than a single route to the construction of the critical theory .",

    "the way to overcome this problem is first to subject ( [ node1_action2 ] ) to a uv - regularization scheme and only then to expand in the spatial fluctuations of the fields .",

    "its main advantages are that it is computationally efficient and better exposes the global structures of the theory than a coordinate - based approach does .      before subjecting the action functional to a gradient expansion ,",
    "let us first make some pedagogical remarks .",
    "for the time being , let @xmath42 be a field taking values in some matrix group @xmath294 , and let us consider the functional determinant @xmath681 & = & { \\bf det } d_m = { \\rm e}^{{\\bf tr } \\ln d_m } = { \\rm      e}^{-s[m ] } \\ ; ,",

    ", we expect this imaginary part to be a multi - valued functional of wzw type .",
    "how can we compute @xmath688 ?    a natural idea is to `` take the square root '' : @xmath689 , and manipulate the determinant as follows : @xmath690 one might now be tempted to assume the multiplicativity of @xmath691 , which would lead to @xmath400 being equal to @xmath692 dropping the diagonal factors on the left and right seems especially innocuous when @xmath693 and @xmath694 are unitary .",

    "where is the error ?",

    "our next task is to compute the diagonal parts of the heat kernels @xmath736 @xmath56 , for small values of the dimensionful parameter @xmath737 .",

    "after all it is hard to conceive that the disorder strength @xmath32 should be reflected only in the value of the uv momentum cutoff @xmath753 .",
    "our analysis using non - abelian bosonization described in the main text reveals the fact that the action above should be supplemented by a current - current interaction with coupling given by @xmath32 .",
    "this begs the question how the existence of this term got lost in the standard scheme of saddle - point approximation plus gradient expansion .",
    "the key to the answer of this question lies in the presence of massive modes in the model , a fact we have ignored thus far .",
    "indeed , we had immediately reduced the hubbard - stratonovich field @xmath51 to its goldstone - mode content , @xmath754 .",
    "in fact , however , the field @xmath51 also contains massive modes , i.e.  modes @xmath326 which are not compatible with the chiral symmetry of the hamiltonian and , therefore , fluctuate at a finite energy cost .",
    "one way of handling the situation would be to put @xmath755 , where the @xmath326 s are not just set to unity but integrated out .",
    "this procedure results in the appearance of an additional current - current interaction @xmath756 unfortunately , it turns out to be impossible to reliably determine the value of the coupling constant of this perturbation within the standard scheme : to obtain the additional term , one has to integrate out massive fluctuations , and yet the mass gap characterizing the modes @xmath326 does not suffice to justify a gaussian approximation to this integral .",
    "the reason for the last fact is that the disorder - generated perturbation of the field theory is strictly rg marginal , which means that there is no dynamically generated mass scale in the problem .",
    "thus , no intrinsic mechanism stabilizing the gaussian approximation exists , fluctuations are important , and to determine the coupling constant , the @xmath326-integral must be performed exactly .",
    "it goes without saying that this is difficult to do in practice .",
    "ultimately it is this deficiency of the standard scheme which forces us to build our theory on the less standard approach of non - abelian bosonization .",
    "as was reviewed in the main text , the low - energy quasi - particles of a dirty @xmath0-wave superconductor behave , in the single - node approximation , as dirac fermions in a random vector potential .",
    "we have argued that non - abelian bosonization takes that theory into a supersymmetric wzw model , from which we rederived the critical exponent for the density of states . in the present appendix we elaborate on this issue and",
    "supply more of the technical details .",
    "let us begin by establishing the general context with a few remarks .",
    "the characteristic feature of a wzw model is the multi - valued term @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "multi - valued functionals of this type were studied in the context of hamiltonian mechanics by novikov @xcite , and became firmly established in field theory through witten s celebrated paper @xcite on non - abelian bosonization . ever since , wzw models defined on compact groups have been an object of intense study .",
    "there exists a vast amount of literature on them , and they have been solved in great detail . to a much lesser extent ,",
    "field theorists have also studied wzw models of the _ non - compact _ type .",
    "the target spaces of these models are _ not _ groups but are non - compact symmetric spaces , the simplest example being @xmath757 .",
    "one of the rare occurrences of such a model is found in @xcite .",
    "the target space of the wzw model we will be concerned with transcends the classical setting in that it is a _",
    "superspace_. it turns out that the proper mathematical construction of a wzw model with superspace target is a delicate matter . indeed , to define a functional integral on euclidean space - time",
    ", one needs a target space with a _ riemannian _",
    "structure , providing for an action functional that is bounded from below .",
    "sadly , the invariant geometry on supergroups , such as @xmath758 , @xmath759 , @xmath760 , @xmath761 etc . , or even on symmetric quotients such as @xmath762 ,",
    "is never riemannian , but always of indefinite signature .",
    "therefore , wzw models , and non - linear sigma models in general , _ do not exist on supergroups _ , at least not in the literal sense ( i.e.  without some procedure of analytic continuation of the fields ) .",
    "one can easily appreciate this point by looking , for example , at the complex lie supergroup @xmath763 , with the standard ( bi-)invariant metric given by @xmath764 , @xmath765 . to understand the properties of this metric tensor",
    ", it suffices to examine it on the tangent space at the group unit , which is the complex lie algebra @xmath766 .",
    "elements of this lie algebra are written as @xmath767 with commuting @xmath768 and anticommuting @xmath769 . via the exponential mapping @xmath770",

    "thus no matter which real form of @xmath766 we choose , the numerical part @xmath772 of the invariant metric will always be of indefinite sign .",
    "note also that it is pointless to replace the compact supergroup @xmath778 by its non - compact analog @xmath779 .",
    "this just reverses the overall sign of the metric , leaving it as indefinite as before",
    ".    one might object that if the target space were taken to be the compact supergroup @xmath778 , the range of all field variables would be finite , and one could then say that compact integrals always exist , no matter what is the sign of the exponent of the boltzmann weight .",
    "this reasoning would be valid if we were dealing with a finite number of compact integrals .",
    "however , the system at hand is a _",
    "functional _ integral over infinitely many degrees of freedom , and to ensure the existence of this functional integral , we do need a target space with riemannian structure . indeed ,",
    "if the metric of the euclidean field theory were lorentzian rather than riemannian , the energy of a field configuration could be diminished below any bound by shortening the wave length of some field . for the case of @xmath778 with boltzmann weight @xmath780",

    "if one attempted to define the field theory by its feynman diagrams , one would encounter the problem that the free - field approximation to the boltzmann weight for a fluctuation @xmath782 with wave number @xmath118 is @xmath783 .",
    "of course one could rescue the stability by putting the theory on a lattice with , say , nearest - neighbour coupling for the @xmath778 field .",

    "even worse , the partition function of the theory ( in the absence of sources ) would be identically zero and hence not normalizable to unity .",

    "we expect the density of states ( the expectation value of the field @xmath42 ) to diverge at zero energy .    for @xmath839 and @xmath552 ,",
    "the conformal dimensions of @xmath42 are @xmath852 .",
    "these coincide with the conformal dimension of the bilinears @xmath853 in the supersymmetric dirac theory with lagrangian @xmath854 since the opes involving the currents match , too , we expect that the two theories are equivalent .",
    "the bosonization rules are the same as in ( [ dictionary ] ) but for factors of two : @xmath855",
    "in the main text we had said that a single wzw theory represents too narrow a framework to consistently describe systems with boundaries : the wzw functional @xmath856/12\\pi$ ] for maps @xmath42 from the position space @xmath73 to the target space @xmath857 ( the riemannian symmetric superspace of type @xmath16 in @xmath22 ) makes sense only if @xmath73 is closed ( i.e. has no boundaries . ) the reason is that , to define @xmath23 $ ] as an integral of the 3-form @xmath858 , one needs to extend @xmath42 to a map @xmath859 where @xmath161 is some 3-space .",
    "but in order for the wzw functional to be independent of the choice of extension @xmath860 , the boundary of @xmath161 must coincide with @xmath73 @xmath861 , which is possible only if @xmath73 is closed ( @xmath862 ) .",
    "thus the wzw functional is ill - defined in the presence of a boundary . to the extent that the wzw model is a faithful representation of the dirac theory",
    ", we expect the implementation of a boundary to be problematic in the latter , too .",
    "how can we cure this disease and arrive at a meaningful functional integral for systems with a boundary ? there exists only one solution to the problem @xcite , and it requires having a minimum of two wzw theories . let s assume there exists a pair of wzw fields @xmath42 and @xmath863 , with the sum of wzw terms being @xmath23 + \\gamma[m^\\prime]$ ] .",
    "the boundary condition we impose is @xmath864 .",
    "( to ensure current conservation , we also need to impose a condition on the normal derivatives of the fields at the boundary . )",
    "this boundary condition guarantees that the two maps @xmath865 and @xmath866 combine to a single map @xmath867 , where @xmath868 consists of two copies of the position space , glued together at the boundary @xmath869 .",
    "because the double covering @xmath868 is a closed manifold , we can regard it as the boundary of a 3-space @xmath161 , so the independence of the choice of extension is restored and the total wzw functional is again well - defined .",
    "having understood this , the question arises : where do we take the second wzw theory from ?",
    "depending on the physics of the problem at hand , a number of options are conceivable : if the original problem mapped onto an _ even number _ of wzw species anyway  this is the case for our @xmath0-wave system  it is natural to glue these fields pairwise together at the boundaries .",
    "this procedure is discussed in the text .",
    "however , one may also contemplate situations where the low - energy sector of the original problem contains only a _",
    "single _ wzw theory .",
    "( in the language of fermions , this amounts to considering a single dirac fermion species . ) in this case , invocing a second wzw field or , equivalently , a second dirac species , changes the low - energy content of the theory . to repair this",
    ", we must give a _ mass _ to the second species , so as to prevent it from contributing to the long - range behaviour of the correlation functions .",
    "note the important fact that the mass of the second species breaks parity , so we can no longer conclude on symmetry grounds that pseudoscalar observables such as the hall conductivity vanish !",
    "if we again carry out the low - energy reduction to the nonlinear sigma model , we will get the same answer as in section [ sec : soft - scatt - brok ] , as the auxiliary second species drops out in the low - energy limit .",
    "moreover , we expect the sign ambiguity @xmath590 to be resolved : it is the sign of the mass of the second species that will determine the sign of @xmath585 .    the second scenario is not new but is known from the work of ludwig et al @xcite who studied a disordered electron model on a square lattice with a magnetic flux of @xmath669 per plaquette .",
    "the low - energy limit of that model consists of two species of dirac fermions , one with a light mass and the other with a heavy mass .",
    "the hall conductivity of the model does not vanish when the light species becomes massless ( and hence the low - energy sector parity - invariant ) , and is determined by the sign of the dirac mass of the heavy species .                                                the first study of the @xmath870dimensional dirac equation with certain types of disorder , a problem closely related to both the dirty @xmath0-wave superconductor and the quantum hall plateau transition , was made in : m. p. a. fisher and e. fradkin , nucl .",

    "the parity operation denotes a point reflection at the origin , @xmath871 . within the context of anomalous superconductivity",
    ", however , `` parity '' mostly stands for a planar reflection , @xmath872 , or any other discrete transformation that reverses the orientation of 2d space .    while the classification scheme is complete ( in the sense that it does provide closure under renormalization ) , it is important to recognize that it does not uniquely determine the physical behaviour of a system .",
