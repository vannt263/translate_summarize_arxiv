    "before analyzing numerical methods for stability it is necessary that the equations they solve be well - posed and stable themselves . in this paper , we consider the semilinear diffusion equation with zero dirichlet boundary conditions , an initial condition , @xmath0 , matching these boundary conditions , and an asymptotically stable ( in the lyapunov sense ) steady - state solution @xmath1 .

    "we focus on semilinear diffusion equations of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a smooth reaction function and given @xmath6 , there exists a @xmath7 such that @xmath8 for all @xmath9 and for all @xmath0 such that @xmath10 , and @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "a strong motivation for studying semilinear diffusion equations is the various dynamical processes in physical , chemical , and biological systems they describe .",
    "for example , the choice @xmath13 yields the fisher - kpp equation that has been used to describe the propagation of a mutant gene as well as chemical propagation of a flame @xcite .",
    "rayleigh - benard convection can be described using @xmath14 yielding the newell - whitehead - segel equation @xcite .",
    "also , the reaction - diffusion of electrolyte in a lead - acid battery cell can be modeled using @xmath15 yielding a simplification of the @xcite . due to measurement limitations or errors",
    ", the initial and boundary conditions may have noise associated with them .",
    "this noise can create an unforeseen instability in the algorithm design , i.e. , artificial _ oscillations _ that propagate in the numerical solution .",
    "we seek to develop an _ oscillation - free _ numerical scheme for solving initial - boundary - value problems of semilinear diffusion equations ( [ eqn : semilinear ] ) .",
    "while stability is required for feasible numerical solution of the semilinear diffusion equation , even stable methods can elicit oscillatory behavior magnifying any initial measurement errors .",
    "one popular method for the diffusion equation is the crank - nicolson method @xcite which is second - order accurate in time and unconditionally stable , but may produce numerical oscillations under certain conditions and would not dampen numerical oscillations inherent in ( [ eqn : semilinear ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", an unconditionally stable and nonoscillatory solution can be constructed using fully implicit methods in time like the well - known backward euler method @xcite .",
    "improving upon the backward euler method , we develop a scheme for solving ( [ eqn : semilinear ] ) that can preserve the same accuracy and unconditional stability as the crank - nicolson method , yet can also eliminate the unwanted oscillations .    while oscillation errors are often reduced or essentially eliminated with smoothing techniques such as essentially nonoscillatory methods @xcite , in this paper , we utilize operator splitting and an oscillation - free scheme to eradicate any numerical oscillations .",
    "we break the problem ( [ eqn : semilinear ] ) into a linear diffusion equation and a nonlinear reaction equation and then recombines the split solutions back together .",
    "the operator splitting , originally developed to solve parabolic equations modeling ocean sound propagation @xcite , is often used to stabilize the solution of stiff linear or nonlinear partial differential equations as linear split portions can be solved with unconditionally stable numerical methods @xcite or even analytically in the frequency domain using fourier transforms @xcite . instead of applying the fourier transform for stability , as it can allow numerical oscillations in certain frequency bands @xcite , we develop a stable and oscillation - free scheme that overcomes any oscillatory behavior for numerically solving the linear diffusion portion of ( [ eqn : semilinear ] ) .",
    "our oscillation - free scheme combines two euler implicit methods that are weighted appropriately . as such",
    ", our method preserves the same accuracy and unconditional stability as the crank - nicolson method but holds the oscillation - free property as the implicit euler method .",
    "we develop our method in section [ sec : method ] , where we analytically show the stability and oscillation - free behavior of our scheme as well .",
    "we implement our oscillation - free split - step method to a fisher - type problem in section  [ sec : results ] . to better represent the reality of measurement errors , randomly distributed noise is added to the initial condition ( inside the boundaries to keep the problem well - posed ) . through the added measurement error",
    ", we illustrate the accuracy and usefulness of our oscillation - free scheme on nonlinear problems by producing oscillation - free solutions as compared to the crank - nicolson method .",
    "hence , we amplify the difference between oscillatory and oscillation - free methods .",
    "in this section we construct and analyze a numerical framework for solving ( [ eqn : semilinear ] ) with second order accuracy in time and space , @xmath16 , which uses a split - step technique to solve simplified split equations with methods which are implicit or exact to ensure unconditional stable solutions and oscillation - free behavior at each step .      instead of solving the semilinear diffusion equation directly ( [ eqn : semilinear ] ) , we use symmetric strang splitting @xcite to solve a linear diffusion split equation and a nonlinear reaction split equation and recombine these split solutions back together .",

    "the example provided in section [ sec : results ] and the models referenced in section [ sec : intro ] , however , do not require magnus expansions as the reaction split equation ( [ eqn : reaction - split ] ) is separable and @xmath56 can be integrated exactly .",

    "predictor - corrector methods , such as the integral deferred correction method , may be used to reduce the splitting error to obtain even higher order accuracy in time @xcite .",
    "when the reaction split equation can be solved exactly , as is the case for each of the motivating model equations in section [ sec : intro ] , error is only be generated by solving the diffusion split equation and recombining the two split solutions .",
    "for the general case , however , we analyze linear stability of the reaction split equation about an asymptotically stable equilibrium point whose existence is proven in theorem [ thm : stable - eqpt ] .",

    "independent of space , the reaction split equation ( [ eqn : semilinear ] ) is componentwise equivalent to an autonomous ordinary differential equations .",
    "either there are no stable equilibrium points , or there is at least one . if no equilibrium points , then the reaction function always positive or always negative . in the semilinear equation ( [ eqn : semilinear ] )",
    ", this has an equivalent effect on the time derivative @xmath61 forcing @xmath62 as @xmath63 .",
    "if no equilibrium points are stable , then the divergence of the reaction function will similarly drive the time derivative , and thus the solution , without bound .",
    "since the semilinear equation ( [ eqn : semilinear ] ) has an asymptotically stable steady - state solution , the reaction function must have at least one asymptotically stable equilibrium solution @xmath59 .",
    "that is @xmath64 and given @xmath6 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 for all @xmath67 to be attracting in an @xmath68-neighborhood of @xmath59 .",

    "a linearization of the reaction split equation about a stable equilibrium point @xmath59 can be written as @xmath70 note , this linearization would contribute @xmath71 error if implemented , but we only use it to evaluate the local behavior of the solution as it converges .",
    "the exact solution of this local linearization is @xmath72 solving ( [ eqn : linearized ] ) over the first and last subintervals ( [ eqn : subintervals ] ) , yields a common amplifying eigenvalue of @xmath73 .",

    "note , since @xmath86 , we have @xmath87    thus , the max eigenvalue , @xmath88 of the combined solution ( [ eqn : weighted - solution ] ) is the product of the eigenvalues of each solution step , @xmath89 since the combined eigenvalue is less than one in magnitude , the idealized linear solution of our method is stable , proving stability of method about the convergent equilibria .",
    "since the eigenvalues of each split solution are nonnegative , the combined eigenvalue is also nonnegative @xmath90 , prohibiting oscillation @xcite .",

    "oscillations inherent in a numerical method are quickly exposed by even the slightest error , as showed in figure [ fig:2](a ) and figure [ fig:5](a ) for the crank - nicolson method , whereas oscillation - free methods remain unaffected by slight discrepancies and eventually damp out even a large error , as demonstrated by the results for our method in figure [ fig:2](b ) and figure [ fig:5](b ) . in other words ,",
    "both split - step solutions recombine stable methods , but the one with weighted backward euler scheme recombines oscillation - free stable methods and the solution stays oscillation - free stable and even dampens our spatial and temporal oscillations created by measurement errors .",
    "however , the split - step solution that recombines stable oscillatory method with the exact split solution propagates initial errors and even becomes unstable for the well - posed problem .",
    "our technique for ensuring oscillation - free stable solutions can be extended beyond the particular schemes used in this paper . in our example problem ( [ eqn : fisher - eq ] ) , we applied a symmetric split - step method that allows us to solve the nonlinear split problem exactly and numerically invert the diffusion split problem only once per whole time step while maintaining second order accuracy in time . not",
    "every semilinear equation can be split to allow access to an exact solution of the nonlinear portion , however , the numerical scheme chosen must be itself oscillation - free stable and maintain the accuracy of the other numerical components .",
    "a linear portion can always be solved using the weighted euler or similar oscillation - free stable scheme and the solutions to the split problems can still be combined alternatingly to guarantee second order accuracy .",
