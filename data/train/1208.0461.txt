    "quantum optics of metamaterials is a new research topic , for which we propose two effective - medium theories .",

    "this quantum optical effective - index theory is valid for metamaterials in thermal equilibrium , but otherwise typically breaks down . unlike in classical optics , the effective dielectric function @xmath21 does not always suffice to describe the output even of perfectly homogenizable metamaterials .",
    "in particular for loss - compensated metamaterials , we showed that balanced homodyne detection can be used to ` open the effective - index blackbox ' and to detect in which of two metamaterials with the same @xmath59 most loss compensation occurs , because loss compensation is not conveniently accompanied by quantum noise compensation .",
    "we showed that on this point the quantum optical effective - index theory fails , and also fails without loss compensation when different effective temperatures coexist due to pumping .",

    "( [ neffalphaeff],[zetaj ] ) can be generalized without difficulty to more than two layers per unit cell or continuously varying @xmath109 .",
    "the formulae do not depend explicitly on the unit cell being layered , which suggests their validity for a much larger class of metamaterials .",
    "this deserves further study , but for a slab of loss - compensated 3d fishnet metamaterial  @xcite , one could again calculate the quantum noise , this time using green - function methods  @xcite , and again average .",
    "our findings are not just relevant for homodyne detection of squeezed light , but for the optics of metamaterials in general , for example when employing superlenses based on loss - compensated multilayers as proposed in ref .   to focus single- or few - photon pulses of light .",
    "the quantum noise grows with thickness of the metamaterial and is independent of the optical input states , and thus is relatively more important for weaker input fields ( fewer photons ) and negligible for bright light .",
    "but whatever input state is used , there will be additional output variance due to the quantum noise in pumped metamaterials , underestimated by effective - index theories , but well predicted by our qoem theory .",
    "analogous to metamaterials , it would be interesting to study the quantum optics of loss - compensated slow - light media  @xcite .    in summary , we identified a fundamental relation between loss compensation and quantum noise , constituting a breakdown of standard effective - index theory , that should be taken into account for few - photon metamaterial applications .",
