    "it is now well known that pulsational frequencies are a primary seismic probe of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "a power of these seismic tools has been firstly explored for the sun and then for various types of pulsating variables at different evolutionary stages .",
    "important results have been obtained also for the main sequence pulsators of the b spectral type .",
    "knowledge of the internal structure and evolution of these massive stars is of great importance for astrophysics because they form the cno elements and are progenitors of type ii supernovae .    each pulsational frequency , @xmath0 ,",
    "is associated with the complex , nonadiabatic parameter @xmath1 , which describes the bolometric flux perturbation normalized to the radial surface displacement .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter is embedded in the expression for a complex amplitude of the light variations .",
    "thus , having multicolour photometric data , one can try to extract empirical values of @xmath1 together with the mode degree , @xmath2 , and compare them with theoretical counterparts .",
    "a value of @xmath1 is determined in subphotospheric layers which have rather weak contribution to the frequency value .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 and @xmath1 constitute the two asteroseismic tools complementary to each other and combining them in a seismic survey yields a new kind of information . in the case of the b - type pulsators",
    ", complex asteroseismology provides a critical and unique test for stellar opacities and the atomic physics .    in this short report , we summarise our results for three early b - type pulsators : @xmath3 ophiuchi , @xmath0 eridani and @xmath4 pegasi .",
    "@xmath3 oph is the b2iv type star in which 7 pulsational frequencies were detected from photometry in a range from 7 to 8 c / d .",
    "three of them appeared also in spectroscopy . using both the op and opal opacity data",
    ", we found a family of seismic models with different parameters ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , which reproduced two centroid frequencies : @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "in general , seismic models with lower metallicity , @xmath9 , demanded a higher core overshooting , @xmath8 .",
    "then , we went a step further by a requirement of fitting simultaneously also the @xmath1 parameter corresponding to the radial mode .",
    "a comparison of empirical and theoretical values of @xmath1 pointed substantially to a preference for the opal tables . for more details",
    "see daszyska - daszkiewicz & walczak ( 2009a ) .",
    "@xmath0 eri and @xmath4 peg are the most multimodal pulsating stars of early b spectral types .",
    "asteroseismic studies of these variables have been intensified after the recent photometric and spectroscopic multisite campaigns which led to a detection of next frequencies typical for the @xmath5 cep type as well as entirely new peaks in the spb frequency domain .",
    "the frequency analysis of the @xmath0 eri data revealed 14 peaks : 12 of the @xmath5 cep type and 2 low frequency modes typical for the spb pulsations . in our seismic analysis , we first looked for stellar models with different ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , which reproduced three centroid frequencies : @xmath14 ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "available data allowed us to determine the @xmath1 parameter for eight high frequency modes and one spb mode .",
    "then , we could compare empirical and theoretical values of @xmath1 in a wide range of pulsational frequencies , i.e. , from 0.6 to 8 c / d .",
    "the obtained consistency is very encouraging and brings a great seismic potential .",
    "the value of @xmath1 depends not only on mode frequency , but also on the shape of eigenfunctions . in the low frequency region ,",
    "@xmath1 strongly depends on the mode degree , @xmath2 , whereas for the high frequency modes it is independent of @xmath2",
    ".    a closer comparison of empirical and theoretical values of @xmath1 for the radial mode indicated again a preference for the opal opacities .",
    "moreover , the opal seismic models had larger effective temperatures and masses which fit better observational values of @xmath7 and luminosity .",
    "more details can be found in daszyska - daszkiewicz & walczak ( 2009b ) .    for more than 50 years , @xmath4 peg was considered as a monoperiodic star .",
    "the analysis of the recent most and ground based photometric and spectroscopic data showed up 8 frequencies of the @xmath5 cep type and 6 peaks of the spb type . using these observations , we were able to determine the empirical values of @xmath1 for four @xmath5 cep modes and for all six spb modes .",
    "the work on this variable is in the making and results will appear soon .",
    "presented examples demonstrate a great potential of * complex seismic studies * consisting in fitting simultaneously pulsational frequencies and corresponding values of the complex , nonadiabatic parameter @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , complex asteroseismology of the b - type pulsators yields a valuable constraints on * stellar opacities*. heretofore , our results indicate a preference for * the opal tables*.    one of the most important results is that empirical values of @xmath1 are determinable also for * high order g modes*. the @xmath1 parameter of the @xmath5 cep and spb modes have a different dependence on the mode frequency and degree , @xmath2",
    ". therefore , complex asteroseismology of the * hybrid pulsators * can give much better assessment of stellar model precision ."
