    "in a 1961 paper rankin @xcite introduced the idea of considering how large a set of integers can be without containing terms which are in geometric progression .",
    "he constructed a subset of the integers which avoids 3-term geometric progressions and has asymptotic density approximately 0.719745 .",
    "brown and gordon @xcite noted that the set rankin considered was the set obtained by greedily including integers subject to the condition that such integers do not create a progression involving integers already included in the set .",
    "other authors , including riddell @xcite , biegelbck , bergelson , hindman and strauss @xcite , nathanson and obryant @xcite , and mcnew @xcite , have refined bounds for the upper density of a set which avoids geometric progressions .",

    "the purpose of @xcite was to see how the results differed when considering subsets of number fields rather than the integers .",
    "here we investigate what happens over function fields of finite characteristic .",
    "in particular , using combinatorial tools as well as the methods of rankin , mcnew , and best et al . , we consider the size of the largest subset of the polynomial ring @xmath0 $ ] which avoids geometric progressions whose common ratio is a non - unit polynomial in this ring .",
    "it is worth remarking on the choice of problem . in the integer case",
    "it is interesting to study sets which avoid 3-term geometric progressions with integral ratio as these sets have a very different flavor from those sets ( called primitive sets ) which avoid 2-term progressions with integral ratio .",
    "the situation is richer over @xmath0 $ ] , for example we now have many more units .",
    "in what follows we will require that our sets avoid 3-terms in a non - unit progression .",

    "the natural construction of @xmath81 , we propose :      a similar trick to the second half of theorem [ theorem : t3q ] proves useful : if the upper density up to some norm @xmath83 of a set @xmath84 is higher than @xmath82 , then there must be some @xmath85 such that all polynomials of norm @xmath85 are in @xmath81 and some , but not all , are in @xmath84 .",
