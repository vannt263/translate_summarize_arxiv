    "the electronic transport and photonic properties of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) such as that found at a semiconductor heterojunction of gaas / algaas have been the subject of interest and discussion for many years now.@xcite related physical properties of narrow quantum wires of 2deg have also been the subject of experimental and theoretical investigations because of their potential for device applications in the field of nanotechnology.@xcite it is thus necessary to specify the model for the edge of a narrow quantum wire.@xcite here , we analyze the role played by the boundaries on the ballistic electron transport in a nanowire of 2deg where the rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) is included .",
    "the role of soi on collective properties of the 2deg has been investigated.@xcite the quasi - one - dimensional channel may be formed by applying a negative bias to a metal gate placed on the surface and depleting the 2deg below it . alternatively , the quasi - one dimensional channel may be made by etching all the way down to the active layer.in either way , it has been demonstrated that the width of the wire could influence the electron transport properties.@xcite in the latter case , the edges are sharper and may be appropriately modeled by sharp and high boundary conditions .",
    "more recently , brey and fertig@xcite have pointed out that graphene nanoribbons have different collective plasmon dispersion relations depending on whether they have armchair or zigzag edges .",
    "it is well established that the spin - orbit coupling is an essentially relativistic effect : an electron moving in an external electric field sees a magnetic field in its rest frame . in a semiconductor",
    ", the interaction causes an electron s spin to precess as it moves through the material , which is the basis of various proposed  spintronic \" devices . in nano - structures , quantum confinement can change the symmetry of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the relativistic motion of an electron is described by a dirac equation .",
    "these effects combine to form both an electric dipole moment and the thomas precession which is due to the rotational kinetic energy in the electric field.@xcite the two mechanisms accidentally have very close mathematical form and consequently combine in a very elegant way .",
    "the soi hamiltonian can be obtained from the dirac equation by taking the non - relativistic limit up to terms quadratic in @xmath3 .",
    "this limit can be achieved either by expanding the dirac equation in powers of @xmath3 or by making use of the asymptotically exact foldy - wouthousen transformation.@xcite    we include the effects due to edges through sharp and high potentials at the boundaries . as a result , we are not able to solve the rashba soi model hamiltonian to obtain analytic solutions for the eigenenergies and eigenfunctions .",
    "the reason for this is due to the fact that the solution manifestly contains quantum interference effects from multiple scattering off the edges .",
    "we solved the eigenvalue problem numerically , obtaining the energies as a function of the wave vector @xmath4 parallel to the edge of the nanowire shown schematically in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "this model for the edges is different from that employed in previous works.@xcite we calculate the ballistic conductance and the electron - diffusion thermoelectric power for this quasi - one - dimensional structure by assuming that the length of the channel between source and drain is less than the electron mean free path . in addition , we assume that the width of the channel is of the order of the de broglie wavelength.@xcite    the outline of the rest of this paper is as follows . in sec.[sec2 ] , we present our model for the wide quantum wire with spin - orbit coupling and specified boundary conditions to simulate the effects arising from the edges of the nanowire .",
    "we also present numerical results for the energy bands in order to study the combined effect of the boundaries and the soi .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is devoted to a brief description of the way in which our calculations are done for the ballistic conductance and electron - diffusion thermoelectric power when the energy bands are symmetric with respect to the wave vector @xmath4 parallel to the edges of the nanowire.@xcite numerical results and discussion of the conductance and the electron - diffusion thermoelectric power as functions of electron densityand temperature , for various wire widths and rashba parameters , are given in sec.[sec4 ] .",
    "a summary of our results is presented in sec.[sec5 ] .",
    "it is now well established that , spin - orbit coupling is an essentially relativistic effect .",
    "the relativistic motion of an electron is described by the dirac equation that contains both effects ( electric dipole and thomas precession ) in the spin - orbit interaction and does so in a very elegant way ( see , e.g. , textbooks@xcite ) .",
    "the soi hamiltonian can be obtained from the dirac equation by taking the non - relativistic limit of the dirac equation up to terms quadratic in @xmath3 inclusive .",
    "this limit can be attained in two different ways : by direct expansion of the dirac equation in powers of @xmath3 and by the asymptotically exact foldy - wouthuysen transformation@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for an electron in the quadratic [ @xmath5 approximation is the sum    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the free - particle hamiltonian and    @xmath8\\cdot \\tensor{{\\bf \\sigma } } \\label{soi-1}\\ ] ]    describes the soi within the material and includes both contributions to the spin - orbit coupling from the electric dipole and the thomas precession ( caused by the electric field ) mechanisms .",
    "this result is _ general _ since it was derived from the dirac equation , an exact relativistic equation for the electron , and includes all possible relativistic effects , whatever might be their kinetic source . when an electron gas at a heterojunction is confined to the @xmath9-plane so that the electrostatic potentialis spatially - uniform along the heterostructure interface and varies only along the @xmath10 axis , the hamiltonian in eq.([soi-1 ] ) contains just the contribution arising from its confinement along the @xmath10 direction . for a quasi - one - dimensional structure , a second term",
    "must now be added to account for the extra local confinement produced by the electric field within the @xmath9-plane .    for quantum wires ,",
    "the width of the potential well is comparable with the spatial spread of the electron wave functions in the @xmath10 direction .",
    "therefore , in order to determine an effective electric field acting on electrons in the potential well , one should calculate an average of the electric field @xmath11 over the range of the @xmath10 variable where the wave function is essentially finite .",
    "consequently , one can model the averaged electric field by a potential profile . in principle",
    ", all potential profiles can be classified in two ways . in the first case ,",
    "the average of @xmath11 is negligible although @xmath11 itself may not be zero or even small .",
    "this applies for symmetric potentials , such as the square and parabolic quantum wells .",
    "however , for asymmetric quantum wells , the average electric field is non - zero in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the 2deg and is called the interface or quantum well electric field . for experimentally achievable semiconductor heterostructures",
    ", this field can be as high as @xmath12v / cm .",
    "therefore , from eq.([soi-1 ] ) , there should be an additional ( compared with the infinite 3d crystal ) mechanism of spin - orbit coupling associated with this field and is usually referred to as the rashba soi for quantum wells.@xcite when we take into account that the quantum well electric field is perpendicular to the heterojunction interface , the spin - orbit hamiltonian has a contribution which can be written for the rashba coupling as    @xmath13    within the zero @xmath10-component ( stationary situation , no electron transfer across the interface ) .",
    "the constant @xmath14 in eq.([soi-2 ] ) , which will be simply denoted as @xmath15 thereafter in this paper , includes universal constants from eq.([soi-1 ] ) and it is proportional to the the interface electric field .",
    "the value of @xmath15 determines the contribution of the rashba spin - orbit coupling to the total electron hamiltonian .",
    "this constant may have values running from @xmath16mev@xmath17 nm .    within the single - band effective mass approximation@xcite",
    ", the total hamiltonian of a quasi - one - dimensional electron system ( q1des ) can be written as    @xmath18    where the electron effective mass @xmath19 incorporates both the crystal lattice and interaction effects .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian derived from the relativistic @xmath20 dirac equation is similar to that which follows from the @xmath21 @xmath22 hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "moroz and barnes@xcite chose the lateral confining potential @xmath23 as a parabola which would be appropriate for very narrow wires since the electrons would be concentrated at the bottom of the potential .",
    "such narrow q1des are difficult to achieve experimentally . we are not aware of any experimental evidence or measurement of the features arising from the spin - orbit coupling resulting from the parabolic confining potential employed by moroz and barnes @xcite .",
    "so , in this paper , we explore the effects of lateral confinement in which the electrons are essentially free over a wide range except close to the edges where the potential rises sharply to confine them .",
    "the in - plane electric field @xmath24 associated with @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that the soi hamiltonian in eq.([soi-3 ] ) is formed by two contributions : @xmath27 .",
    "the first one , @xmath28 , [ in eq.([soi-2 ] ) ] arises from the asymmetry of the quantum well , i.e. , from the rashba mechanism@xcite for the spin - orbit coupling . for convenience ,",
    "in what follows we will refer to the rashba mechanism of the spin - orbit coupling as @xmath15-coupling .",
    "if the lateral confinement is sufficiently strong , for narrow and deep potentials or sharp and high potentialsat the edges , then the electric field associated with it may not be negligible compared with the interface - induced ( rashba ) field .",
    "we use    @xmath29    for a conducting channel of width @xmath30 with well depth @xmath31 . here",
    ", @xmath32 is the complimentary error function .",
    "plots of @xmath33as a function of @xmath34 are shown in fig.[f0 ] for three values of @xmath35 . for this potential , the hamiltonian ( [ soi-1 ] )",
    "gives a term    @xmath36- \\exp\\left[-\\frac{x^2}{2\\ell_0 ^ 2}\\right]\\right\\}\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y } \\equiv i\\beta { \\cal f}(x)\\,\\sigma_{\\rm z}\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\ , \\label{beta}\\ ] ]    where each gaussian has width @xmath37 at the edges @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "in eq.([beta ] ) , @xmath40 is related to the electric field due to lateral confinement in the @xmath41 direction . since @xmath42 characterizes the steepness of the potentials at the two edges , we are at liberty to use a range of values of the ratio of these two lengths , keeping in mind that the in - plane confinement must be appreciable if the @xmath43-term is to play a role .",
    "therefore , in most of our calculations , we use only one small value of @xmath44 to illustrate the effects arising from our model on the conductance and thermoelectric power .",
    "we introduced the parameter @xmath45 , which is expressed in terms of fundamental constants as well as @xmath31 and @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47 is another rashba parameter due to the electric confinement along the @xmath41 direction , and it is simply denoted as @xmath43 thereafter in this paper .",
    "comparison of typical electric fields originating from the quantum well and lateral confining potentials allows one to conclude that a reasonable estimate@xcite for @xmath43 should be roughly 10% of @xmath15 . the @xmath43-soi term in eq.([beta ] )",
    "is asymmetric about the mid - plane @xmath48 and varies quadratically with the displacement from either edge . in this quasi - square well potential",
    ", the electron wave functions slightly penetrate into the barrier regions .",
    "however , we only need energy levels for the calculations of ballistic transport electrons , not the wave functions , if we assume electronic system is a spatially - uniform quasi - one - dimensional one .",
    "the eigenfunctions for the nanowire have the form    @xmath49\\ . \\label{state}\\ ] ]    since the nanowire is translationally invariant in the @xmath50-direction with @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a normalization length and @xmath53 , we must solve for @xmath54 and @xmath55 in eq.([state ] ) numerically due to the presence of edges at @xmath38 and @xmath39 . substituting the wave function in eq.([state ] ) into the schrdinger equation , i.e. @xmath56 with @xmath57 being the eigenenergy , we obtain the two coupled equations    @xmath58    in the absence of any edges , we may simply set @xmath59 for a quantum well , and get @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are independent of @xmath41 , and @xmath64 is the electron wave number along the @xmath41 direction , which then yields a pair of simultaneous algebraic equations for states @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "but , in the case when there exist edges , we have a pair of coupled differential equations to solve for @xmath67 and @xmath68 which may be analyzed when only @xmath43 is not zero and then when both rashba parameters are non - zero .",
    "two parameters of interest are    @xmath69    with three ratios    @xmath70    in our numerical calculations below , we will use three ratios to determine how sharp the nanowire potential is and how strong the rashba parameters are .",
    "when we set @xmath71 in eq.([coupled : eqs ] ) , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are equal to each other ( @xmath72 ) and are solutions of a schrdinger equation with a potential term present .",
    "when we solved the wave equations , we imposed the condition that the wave functions must vanish when either @xmath73 or @xmath74 holds .",
    "however , our calculations showed that the wave functions are negligible on the two edges of the nanowire when the confining potential is deep and sharp .",
    "the effect of the potential depends on @xmath4 , leading to a dependence of the transverse energy @xmath75 on the longitudinal wave number @xmath4 .",
    "if we set @xmath15 equal to zero in eq.([coupled : eqs ] ) , the solutions are approximately those for a quasi - square well when @xmath76 is chosen small and the potential barriers are high ( see fig.[f0 ] ) . in this case , the transverse energy eigenvalues are approximately given by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "in fig.[fig:2 ] , we present the energy bands for the calculated transverse energy @xmath75 in units of @xmath80 when the electric field - induced rashba soi parameter @xmath15 is set equal to zero so that only the effect from the @xmath43-term is included .",
    "the two equations coincide and , of course , there is no effect from the rashba term on @xmath81 when @xmath82 , and the eigenvalues are equal to those of the square well with high barriers corresponding to @xmath83 .",
    "however , as @xmath84 is increased , @xmath81 decreases linearly as a function of @xmath4 before its first drop . on the other hand , the dependence of the transverse energy has been shown to be a strong non - linear function of @xmath4 at its drop . as a matter of fact , the levels anti - cross at a value of @xmath84 which is determined by the chosen value of @xmath85 and @xmath44 .",
    "the displacing effect of the @xmath43-coupling on the eigenstates is reminiscent of the role played by magnetic field on the eigenenergies of a quasi - one - dimensional electron gas with harmonic confinement .",
    "however , the anti - crossing seems to be a unique property of the square barrier model with high potentials at the edges since it was not reported by moroz and barnes@xcite for a parabolic confinement .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows that when @xmath83 , it does not matter what value is chosen because the energy level dependence on @xmath4 remains the same . when @xmath86 , the influence on the @xmath4 dispersion can be seen",
    "however , this part of the energy spectrum makes a negligible contribution to the transport and thermoelectric power .      in fig.[fig:3 ] , we present the transverse energies @xmath81 in units of @xmath80 as functions of @xmath84 for a non - zero value of @xmath15 .",
    "the plots compare the results for two chosen values of @xmath88 ( black curve ) and @xmath89 ( red curve ) .",
    "the energy bands for the infinite 2deg at @xmath90 due only to the @xmath15-coupling ( without transverse confinement ) consist of a pair of spin - split upward - curved parabolic - like energy dispersions which are displaced in @xmath4-space and degenerate at @xmath82 , and become split as @xmath4 increases .",
    "in the presence of edges for a nanowire , there is a discrete set of eigenstates for a chosen value of @xmath4 .",
    "these energy subbands then anti - cross .",
    "this anti - crossing effect increases as the value of @xmath43 is increased , as demonstrated by comparing the results of fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "these results are qualitatively in agreement with fig.3 in ref .",
    "[ ] ( see also ref . )",
    "the difference is that for reasonable values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the scaled @xmath4 becomes larger in comparison with a parabolic confinement for one to see the anti - crossing behavior .",
    "figures  [ fig:4 ] show plots of total energy levels @xmath57 with @xmath93 as functions of @xmath84 for @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( upper - left panel ) and @xmath96 , @xmath95 ( upper - right panel ) , respectively . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "the plot for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath93 ( lower panel ) is also presented in this figure . from figs.[fig:4 ] , we easily find that the energy dispersion is symmetric with respect to @xmath82 .",
    "our results ( two upper panels ) further show that , as expected from eq.([coupled : eqs ] ) , the @xmath15-term has an effect when @xmath99 on the unperturbed energy eigenvalues in the absence of any rashba soi .",
    "as @xmath4 is increased , the soi lifts the degeneracy of the energy subbands , as shown by a pair of solid and dashed curves degenerated at @xmath82 in the upper two panels .",
    "we further observed that when the @xmath15-coupling is weak ( upper - left panel ) , each branch of the energy curves , except for the first branch , has only _ one _ local minimum and this occurs at @xmath82 .",
    "as @xmath15 is increased ( upper - right panel ) , two local minima develop symmetrically on either side of @xmath82 with a local maximum at @xmath82 for each branch .",
    "in this section , we briefly outline our method of calculation for the ballistic conductance and electron - diffusion thermoelectric power . in our case , the energy bands are symmetric with respect to the wave numbers @xmath100 . for the symmetric bands , energy dispersion @xmath101 , the fermi function @xmath102 , and the group velocity @xmath103 satisfy the relations : @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , one can write the following equation@xcite in a form which includes only positive values of the wave number for the ballistic heat ( @xmath107 ) and charge ( @xmath108 ) currents , i.e. ,    @xmath109\\ , d\\varepsilon_{j , k_y}\\ , \\label{basic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath110 , @xmath111 is the bias voltage between the source and drain electrodes , @xmath112 is the sign function , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 is the chemical potential . in eq.([basic ] ) , the whole energy integration performed over the range @xmath115 is divided into the sum of many sub - integrations between two successive extremum points @xmath116 for @xmath117 , and @xmath118 is the last minimum point . for each sub - integration over @xmath4 , @xmath101 is a monotonic function . in addition , each sub - integration in eq.([basic ] ) can be calculated analytically , leading to the following expression for electron - diffusion thermoelectric power    @xmath119\\ , \\label{thermo}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 is the temperature , @xmath120 , and the dimensionless conductance @xmath121 is given by    @xmath122    physically , the quantity @xmath121 defined in eq.([fermi ] ) represents the number of pairs of the fermi points at @xmath123k . in eqs.([thermo ] ) and ( [ fermi ] ) , the summations over @xmath124 are for all the energy - extremum points on each @xmath125th spin - split subband in the range @xmath115 .",
    "the quantity @xmath116 is the energy at the extremum point @xmath126 . for a given @xmath125th spin - split subband , @xmath127 ( or @xmath128 ) for a local energy minimum ( maximum ) point .",
    "the physical conductance @xmath0 is related to @xmath121 for spin - split subbands through    @xmath129",
    "in figs.[fig:5 ] , we have displayed comparisons of modified electron density ( @xmath130 ) dependence of the ballistic conductance ( @xmath0 ) and the electron - diffusion thermoelectric power ( @xmath1 ) by the @xmath15-term in the soi when @xmath131k and @xmath132   . from the upper panel of fig.[fig:5 ] , we find that , as @xmath71 ( black curve ) , a number of steps in @xmath0 show up as a result of successive populations of more and more spin - degenerate subbands , shown in the lower panel of fig.[fig:4 ] .",
    "in addition , the observed plateau becomes wider and wider as higher and higher subbands are occupied by electrons due to increased energy - level separation , resulting from the high potential barriers at the two edges .",
    "the finite - temperature effect can easily be seen from the smoothed steps in this figure . as @xmath15",
    "is increased to @xmath133ev@xmath17  ( red curve ) , the steps are rightward shifted to higher electron densities due to an enhanced density - of - states from the flattened subband dispersion curves by soi , as seen from the upper - left panel of fig.[fig:4 ] .",
    "however , the step sharpness remains constant in this case .",
    "furthermore , there exists no  pole - like feature\"@xcite in this figure , which can be traced back to the absence of spike - like feature in the subband dispersion curves , leading to additional local energy minimum / maximum points . the suppressed spike - like feature in the subband dispersion curves",
    "can be explained by a nonlinear @xmath41 dependence near the center ( @xmath48 ) of a transverse symmetric potential well with a large @xmath43 value in our model for wide quantum wires , instead of a linear @xmath41 dependence close to the center of the confining potential in the model proposed by moroz and barnes@xcite for narrow quantum wires .",
    "we also see sharp peaks in @xmath1 from the lower panel of fig.[fig:5 ] as @xmath71 ( black curve ) , corresponding to the steps in @xmath0 , which again comes from successive population of spin - degenerate subbands with increased @xmath134.@xcite the center of a plateau in @xmath0 aligns with the minimum of @xmath1 between two peaks.@xcite the peaks ( red curve ) are rightward shifted accordingly in electron density when a finite value of @xmath15 is assumed .",
    "we have compared in figs.[fig:6 ] the results of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for two values of wire width @xmath30 at @xmath131k and @xmath135ev@xmath17 .",
    "we find from the upper panel of fig.[fig:6 ] that , as @xmath30 decreases from @xmath136    ( black curve ) to @xmath137    ( red curves ) , the steps in @xmath0 are leftward shifted in electron density , and meanwhile , the steps become sharpened .",
    "the step shifting is a result of the reduction of soi effect due to a smaller value for @xmath92 ( proportional to @xmath138 ) with a fixed value of @xmath15 , by comparing the upper - right panel with the upper - left panel of fig.[fig:4 ] .",
    "this leads to a leftward shift in steps for the same reason given for the upper panel of fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "the step sharpening , on the other hand , comes from the significantly increased subband separation ( proportional to @xmath139 ) , which effectively suppresses the thermal - population effect on @xmath0 for smoothing out the conductance steps .",
    "the shifting of steps in @xmath0 with @xmath30 is also reflected in @xmath1 , as shown in the lower panel of fig.[fig:6 ] . the peaks of @xmath1 get sharpened due to the suppression of @xmath1 in the density region corresponding to the widened plateaus of @xmath0 .    in order to achieve an overview for the variations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with both @xmath2 and @xmath130 , we present two contour plots of these quantities , respectively , in figs.[fig:7 ] with @xmath140  and @xmath135ev@xmath17 . from the upper - left panel of fig.[fig:7 ] , we find that @xmath0 decreases with @xmath2 , but increases with @xmath130 in general .",
    "the increase of @xmath0 with @xmath130 is a direct result of opening more conduction channels , i.e. more populated subbands , for ballistically - transported electrons .",
    "the reduction of @xmath0 with @xmath2 is a consequence of the dramatic decrease of the chemical potential with @xmath2 for a fixed @xmath130 ( not shown ) , and then , the decrease of the fermi function in eq.([fermi ] ) for @xmath141k .",
    "however , @xmath0 does increase with @xmath2 at @xmath142@xmath143 within the range @xmath144k , as shown in the lower - left panel of fig.[fig:7 ] , because of the anomalous increase of the chemical potential with @xmath2 in this temperature range whenever the fermi energy at @xmath123k is set close to a minimum of any one of spin - split subbands .",
    "when @xmath145 is reduced from @xmath146 ( red curve ) to @xmath147 ( blue curve ) for softer potential edges , @xmath0 is only slightly decreased at low @xmath2 , but is significantly increased at high @xmath2 .",
    "we also find , from the upper - right panel of fig.[fig:7 ] , that @xmath1 increases with @xmath2 but decreases with @xmath130 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath1 with @xmath130 is simply due to the increase of @xmath0 .",
    "as expected , @xmath1 varies linearly with @xmath2 for small values of @xmath2 but deviates from the linear behavior for large values of @xmath2 , as shown in the lower - right panel of fig.[fig:7].@xcite however , @xmath1 , in this case , goes towards its minimum value about zero at @xmath148@xmath143 as @xmath149 because @xmath0 approaches the quantized value @xmath150 for this electron density .",
    "when @xmath145 is reduced from @xmath146 ( red curve ) to @xmath147 ( blue curve ) , @xmath1 is enhanced at high @xmath2 .",

    "similar to the two upper panels of fig.[fig:7 ] , @xmath0 ( upper - left panel ) increases with @xmath130 but with much steeper steps , and @xmath1 ( upper - right panel ) decreases with @xmath130 but at a more rapid rate at a higher temperature . at a higher electron density @xmath152@xmath143 in the lower - left panel of fig.[fig:8 ] , for a reduced value of @xmath30 ,",
    "the range for anomalous increase of @xmath0 with @xmath2 expands up to @xmath153k .",
    "this is further accompanied by a locking of @xmath0 to its quantized value at @xmath154 for @xmath144k .",
    "however , @xmath0 is reduced at high @xmath2 in this case when @xmath145 is reduced from @xmath146 ( red curve ) to @xmath147 ( blue curve ) .",
    "moreover , the locked @xmath0 value leads to an almost zero value for @xmath1 within this temperature range , as seen from the lower - right panel of fig.[fig:8 ] .",
    "a clear linear dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath2 is found for @xmath155k due to suppressed thermal - population effect by a reduced wire width .",
    "when @xmath145 is reduced from @xmath146 ( red curve ) to @xmath147 ( blue curve ) , no significant changes to @xmath1 can be observed here .",
    "in this paper we investigated the effect that the spin - orbit interaction has on the energy band structure , the conductance and the electron - diffusion thermoelectric power of a nanowire .",
    "we used a model in which edge effects for the nanowires are taken into account by solving numerically dirac s equation in a quasi - square potential . comparing our model with the already published work where harmonic confinement was used to describe the transverse confinement",
    ", we found that the energy bands are different and in addition to crossing effect of the transverse energy bands , there is also anticrossing for specific finite values of @xmath156 .",
    "the @xmath43-term of the hamiltonian causes a displacement and a deformation of the transverse energy band structure which is more pronounced for large values of @xmath156 .",
    "the conductance plateaus become wider when the electron density is increased as a result of larger energy - level separation as the higher subbands are occupied by electrons .",
    "also , due to the nonlinear dependence of @xmath43-soi on position close to the well center , there is no  pole - like feature \" in @xmath0 which is obtained when a harmonic potential is assumed for confinement .",
    "the electron - diffusion thermoelectric power @xmath1 displays a peak whenever a spin - split subband is populated . at low temperature , the variation of @xmath1 is linear in @xmath2 but deviates from the linear behavior for large values of @xmath2 .",
    "we note that if the effect due to electron interaction is strong in our system , the ballistic model in our paper can not be justified . for high - mobility semiconductor quantum wires",

    ", electron transport can also be diffusive if the wire length is longer than the mean free path of electrons but less than the localization length . in the latter case",
    ", the interaction of electrons with impurities , roughness , phonons and other electrons will play a significant role in both the temperature and density dependence of electron mobility in quantum wires .",
    "for high temperature and low density , electron - phonon scattering is dominant .",
    "however , the electron - electron scattering becomes significant in a system with high density at low temperature . in this paper , we restricted ourselves to the ballistic regime for a short quantum wire .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of electron - electron interaction , an effect of lateral spin - orbit coupling on transport is to trigger a spontaneous but negligible spin polarization in the nanowire .",
    "however , the spin polarization is enhanced substantially when the effect of electron - electron interaction is included .",
