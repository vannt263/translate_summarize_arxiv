    "spin glasses @xcite ( sg ) have been a subject of intensive investigations for more than four decades .",
    "the main difficulties in such systems come from the combination of the frustration @xcite and the bond disorder .",
    "one of the most interesting questions is the law of the relaxation time in disordered systems .",
    "there is a large number of theories yielding various results since the first pioneering work by r. kohlrausch which introduced phenomenologically in 1847 the so - called stretched exponential relaxation ( ser ) law .",
    "the reader is referred to the review by phillips @xcite for numerous examples of systems , not limited to sg , with theoretical and experimental results .",
    "we are interested in this paper in sg : there have been several theoretical and numerical works dealing with the ser .",
    "ogielski @xcite has studied an ising spin model of sg on a simple cubic lattice with a random nearest - neighbor @xmath5 bond distribution by using intensive monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . among his numerous results , he found that dynamic correlations follow the ser above the spin - glass transition temperature @xmath8 and a power law below @xmath8 for short and long times .",
    "the ser is written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an ising spin at the time @xmath11 , @xmath12 indicates the thermal average , @xmath13 denotes an average over disordered samples , @xmath14 a constant , @xmath15 and @xmath6 are temperature - dependent coefficients .",
    "ogielski found that @xmath6 is equal to @xmath7 at @xmath8 and it increases with increasing temperature ( @xmath16 ) . below @xmath8 , he found that @xmath17 follows the algebraic decay @xmath18 where @xmath15 does not have the same temperature - dependence above and below @xmath8 .",
    "de dominicis _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found by a calculation in the random - free - energy landscape that the relaxation to equilibrium follows a ser which depends on the choice of the transition probability between valleys in the free energy space .",
    "there have been a number of other theories showing a ser behavior among which we can mention the trap model@xcite , the hierarchical model@xcite , and the model of random walkers on dilute hypercubes of high dimensions@xcite . in the last model , almeida _",
    "@xcite found , by a calculation using a random walk on the dilute hypercube , a ser near the percolation transition which is similar to the topology of spin configurations near the transition in ising sg .",
    "they found that @xmath6 is equal to @xmath19 at the percolation threshold @xmath20 and it increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "a recent mc simulation of the sherrington - kirkpatrick ising sg model at and above @xmath8 shows a long - time ser with @xmath6 equal to @xmath7 at @xmath8@xcite .",
    "experimentally , let us mention a few data which show a ser with precise values of @xmath6 .",
    "early works on canonical sg ag : mn @xcite found a ser below @xmath8 with @xmath21 where @xmath22 for @xmath23 from 0.5 to 0.8 . in an experiment on cu@xmath24co@xmath24cl@xmath25-fecl@xmath26 graphite bi - intercalation compound ,",
    "suzuki and suzuki@xcite observed a @xmath6 value nearly equal to 0.3 at @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite found in ni - doped la@xmath27sr@xmath28cuo@xmath29 a best fit of their time dependence of the relaxation with a ser .",
    "another point which motivates our present work is the effect of quenched bond randomness in systems having a first - order transition .",
    "note that in a pure system with a second - order transition , the effect of a small amount of bond disorder is understood according to the harris criterion @xcite . in systems with a first - order transition , this question has been examined since 1989 by a number of important investigations mostly in two dimensions ( 2d)@xcite , inspired from the pioneering work of imry and ma on the 2d random - field ising model @xcite .",
    "these works have shown that a small quenched bond disorder suffices to make disappear the latent heat in a pure 2d system having a first - order transition .",
    "in particular , hui and berker@xcite have demonstrated this by looking at the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) spin-1 model in 2d , with a renormalization group ( rg ) argument .",
    "cardy and jacobsen @xcite have illustrated this with the @xmath30 potts model by the use of finite - size scaling and conformal invariance .",
    "there is however a contradiction between different researchers concerning the universality of the resulting second - order transition upon introducing a small disorder : some authors @xcite claimed that this should belong to a new random fixed point for @xmath31 , while others favored the 2d ising universality class @xcite . in 3d ,",
    "falicov and berker @xcite have shown by a rg calculation that the tricritical point in the pure beg model is replaced , when bond randomness is introduced , by a segment of second - order transitions bounded at one end by a multicritical point and at the other end by a new random tricritical point .",
    "interestingly , they have shown that there exists a threshold of randomness beyond which the random tricritical point goes down to @xmath32 .",
    "in a recent paper , malakis _",
    "et al._@xcite have carried out a mc study on the 3d beg model on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "they showed that the tricritical point moves in the direction to reduce the first - order line in the phase diagram and the so - become second - order transition segment has the critical behavior of the 3d random ising model .",
    "in addition , fernandez _",
    "et al._@xcite have also shown by microcanonical mc simulations that the 3d site - dilute 4- and 8-state potts models confirm the conjecture of cardy and jacobsen @xcite in 3d .",
    "for quantum spin systems , greenblatt _",
    "et al._@xcite showed rigorously the disappearance of first - order transition with randomness in 2d and in dimension @xmath33 , just as for the classical case @xcite .",
    "note that in the case where the pure model has a second - order transition such as when @xmath34 , domany and wiseman @xcite have shown that a random quenched bond disorder changes the second - order @xmath34 potts universality into a 2d pure ising one .",
    "the present paper addresses the two points mentioned above : ( i ) to verify the conjecture of cardy and jacobsen @xcite on the disappearance of the latent heat in the case of a 3d first - order transition when a quenched bond disorder is introduced ( see fig . 1 of their paper ) , and to see if the result found for the 3d beg model@xcite applies to other models such as the one studied in the present paper ( ii ) to study dynamic correlations of the spin - glass phase created at a strong bond disorder of our model to verify that the results of ogielski are model - independent . to carry out these purposes",
    ", we consider the pure ising face - centered cubic ( fcc ) antiferromagnet with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction .",
    "this model is fully frustrated since the lattice is composed of equilateral triangles with antiferromagnetic interaction @xcite .",
    "it shows a very strong first - order transition @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to a description of our model and the simulation method .",
    "results are shown and discussed in section iii .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "we consider the fcc lattice with ising spins of magnitude @xmath35 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ising spin at the lattice site @xmath38 , @xmath39 is made over the nn spin pairs @xmath37 and @xmath40 with interaction @xmath41 .",
    "hereafter we suppose that @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) for antiferromagnetic bonds and @xmath44 for ferromagnetic bonds .",

    "the four sublattices are shown in fig .",

    "hereafter , the energy is measured in the unit of @xmath50 and @xmath16 in the unit of @xmath51 .",
    "we start with the pure antiferromagnetic state . for this case",
    ", it is well - known that the bulk fcc antiferromagnet with ising spins shows a very strong first - order transition @xcite .",
    "the phase transition in the heisenberg model also shows a first - order character @xcite .",
    "other similar frustrated antiferromagnets such as the hcp antiferromagnet show the same behavior @xcite .    to create a spin glass ,",
    "we introduce a number of ferromagnetic bonds @xmath52 in a random manner into the pure antiferromagnetic state .",
    "the ferromagnetic bond concentration @xmath0 is thus @xmath53 .",
    "the phase transition behavior of the system depends on the parameter @xmath0 ( @xmath54 ) , i.e. it changes from pure antiferromagnetic phase at @xmath55 to pure ferromagnetic phase at @xmath56 , passing through the spin - glass phase .    in order to investigate the nature of the phase transition and the relaxation behavior at various @xmath0",
    ", we use the standard mc method and the wang - landau technique of simulation .",
    "wang and landau@xcite have proposed a mc algorithm for classical statistical models which allowed to study systems with difficultly accessed microscopic states . in particular",
    ", it allows us to detect with efficiency weak first - order transitions@xcite .",
    "the algorithm uses a random walk in the energy space to get an accurate estimate for the density of states ( dos ) @xmath57 which is defined as the number of spin configurations for any given @xmath58 .",
    "this method is based on the fact that a flat energy histogram @xmath59 is produced if the probability for the transition to a state of energy @xmath58 is proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "we summarize how this algorithm is implied here . at the beginning of the simulation",
    ", the density of states @xmath57 is unknown so all densities are set to unity , @xmath61 .",
    "we begin a random walk in energy space @xmath62 by choosing a site randomly and flipping its spin with a transition probability @xmath63 , \\label{eq : wlprob}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the energy of the current state and @xmath64 is the energy of the proposed new state . each time an energy level @xmath58 is visited ,",
    "the dos is modified by a modification factor @xmath65 whether the spin is flipped or not , i.e. @xmath66 . at the beginning of the random",
    "walk , the modification factor @xmath67 can be as large as @xmath68 .",
    "a histogram @xmath59 records the number of times a state of energy @xmath58 is visited .",
    "each time the energy histogram satisfies a certain  flatness \" criterion , the histogram @xmath59 is then reset to zero , and the modification factor is reduced , typically to the square root of the previous factor , to produce a finer estimate of @xmath57 .",
    "the reduction process of the modification factor @xmath67 is repeated several times until a final value @xmath69 which is close enough to one .",
    "the histogram is considered as flat if @xmath70 for all energies , where @xmath71 is chosen between @xmath72 and @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the average histogram .",
    "the thermal average of a thermodynamic quantity @xmath75 can be evaluated by@xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the partition function defined by @xmath78 the canonical distribution at any @xmath16 can be calculated simply by @xmath79    in this work , we consider an energy range of interest@xcite @xmath80 .",
    "we divide this energy range into @xmath81 subintervals , the minimum energy of each subinterval is @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and the maximum of the subinterval @xmath38 is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 can be chosen large enough for a smooth boundary between two subintervals .",
    "the wl algorithm is used to calculate the relative dos of each subinterval @xmath86 with the modification factor @xmath87 and flatness criterion @xmath88 .",
    "we reject the suggested spin flip and do not update @xmath57 and the energy histogram @xmath59 of the current energy level @xmath58 if the spin - flip trial would result in an energy outside the energy segment .",
    "the dos of the whole range is obtained by joining the dos of each subinterval @xmath89 .",
    "we performed runs with different random quenched bond disorders at each given @xmath0 for bond - configuration averaging .",
    "the edwards - anderson order parameter , the magnetization ( and sublattice magnetization ) and the susceptibility are obtained by standard mc simulations with the equilibration time of @xmath90 mc steps / spin and the averaging time of @xmath91 mc steps / spin . the energy , specific heat and energy histograms are obtained by the wl technique in order to detect with precision the latent heat @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : ep0000 ] , we show the case of @xmath55 where the energy and the sublattice magnetization versus @xmath16 undergo a well - known first - order transition@xcite with a discontinuity at the transition temperature @xmath92 .",
    "figure [ fig : pep0000 ] shows a double peak of the energy distribution at @xmath92 which confirms the first - order behavior .    the latent heat @xmath85 is defined by the energy separation of the two peaks in the energy distribution .",
    "when the transition is of second order , the energy is continuous , namely @xmath93 . using the wl technique which is very efficient to detect first - order transitions , we calculate the energy histogram with various small values of @xmath0 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : de ] the latent heat versus @xmath0 . as seen , @xmath85 is not zero for @xmath94 . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the phase transition is continuous .",
    "the disappearance of the latent heat for such a small amount of bond disorder is striking .",
    "this result is in agreement with the rg result on the 3d beg model@xcite , with the conjecture of cardy and jacobsen@xcite for the 3d case ( see fig . 1 of their paper ) , and with predictions of other earlier works @xcite . to our knowledge , the present work is the first verification in 3d of the disappearance of the latent heat with a tiny amount of bond disorder .",
    "there is thus a tricritical point at @xmath96 beyond which the transition is of second order .",
    "this result is in agreement with mc simulations on the 3d beg model@xcite and site - dilute potts model@xcite .",
    "an interesting question arises on the nature of the second - order transition coming from the ex first - order transition .",
    "et al._@xcite have shown that the critical behavior belongs to the 3d random ising model in violation of the universality of the whole second - order line . to verify this result on our present fcc frustrated model",
    ", we need intensive mc simulations with high - performance techniques such as multiple histograms .",
    "this formidable task is not the scope of the present paper .",
    "note that the change of the nature of the phase transition with randomness occurs also in the so - called fully frustrated simple cubic lattice with ising spins@xcite : it was found by mc simulations that a very small amount of bond dilution changes the transition from a weak first - order transition into a sg transition @xcite .    for the case of pure ferromagnet ,",
    "i.e. @xmath56 , the transition is a second - order one as expected for a 3d ising ferromagnet .",
    "let us consider intermediate values of @xmath0 where the spin - glass phase is expected .",
    "the spin - glass phase is determined by the edwards - anderson freezing order parameter defined as @xcite @xmath97 the averaging time @xmath98 is taken as long as possible ( at least several millions of mc steps per spin ) , after an equivalent equilibration time @xmath99 . in the calculation of @xmath100 , we follow each spin during the time @xmath98 while calculating its time - averaged value . at the end , we take an average over all spins .",
    "so , @xmath100 expresses the degree of spin freezing , independent of spin configuration .",
    "the magnetization is defined as @xmath101 here , @xmath102 is averaged over all spins before the time averaging . in a state with randomly frozen spins , the magnetization @xmath102 is zero so that it can not distinguish a frozen phase from the paramagnetic phase .",
    "we show now in fig .",
    "[ fig : ep0500 ] the energy and the specific heat versus @xmath16 for @xmath103 where the bond disorder is strongest .",
    "the magnetization @xmath102 versus @xmath0 at @xmath104 and @xmath105 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpt ] . note that for the antiferromagnetic side ( small @xmath0 ) we use in that figure the sublattice magnetization .",
    "if a spin - glass phase is defined as the one where the magnetization ( or sublattice magnetization ) is zero but not @xmath100 at low @xmath16 , then we find that the spin - glass phase exists in the range @xmath106 .",
    "the phase diagram @xmath107 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcp ] where @xmath92 is obtained at each @xmath0 when @xmath100 goes down to zero .",
    "note that the maxima of the specific heat @xmath108 and the susceptibility @xmath109 are located at a temperature higher than @xmath92 .",
    "for example , at @xmath110 , @xmath111 at @xmath112 while the peaks of @xmath14 and @xmath109 are at @xmath113 . the fact that the maxima of the specific heat and the susceptibility are located at a temperature higher than @xmath92 does not result from a finite - size effect .",
    "these maxima are due to the change of the correlation nature in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "a very detailed discussion on this phenomenon has been given by ogielski @xcite and by binder and young @xcite .",
    "briefly , above the maxima of @xmath108 and @xmath109 the system is in a `` normal '' paramagnetic regime ( short - range correlation , short relaxation times , ... ) . at the maximum of @xmath108 ( and @xmath109 ) , the sg behavior sets in with dramatic rapid increase of sg correlation length and correlation times as well as the nonlinear sg susceptibility .",
    "however , only at the sg transition temperature @xmath92 that these quantities diverge .",
    "there are several striking features shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcp ] :    \\i ) the phase diagram is not symmetric with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the fcc lattice is fully frustrated at @xmath55 ( antiferromagnetic ) and non - frustrated at @xmath56 .",
    "note that the case where the pure system is non - frustrated such as the simple cubic ferro- or antiferromagnets ( bipartite lattice ) , the phase diagram @xmath107 is symmetric because the system is invariant with respect to the local transformation of every spin pair ( @xmath114 .",
    "\\ii ) the first - order transition line terminates at @xmath115 ( see inset ) .",
    "as said earlier , in the present 3d model , such a tiny bond randomness suffices to change the first - order transition into a continuous transition .",
    "\\iii ) the long - range antiferromagnetic ordering is destroyed for @xmath116 ( we examined the sublattice magnetization @xmath102 down to @xmath117 ) .",
    "the fact that such a very small @xmath0 suffices to destroy the long - range antiferromagnetic order is not a real surprise if we examine the nature of the long - range ordering in the antiferromagnetic limit : it is known that the ground - state ( gs ) spin configuration of the fcc antiferromagnet is a stacking of corner - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "each tetrahedron has six choices of two spins up and two spins down on its corners ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fcc - cell ] ) .",
    "such a stacking gives rise to an infinite number of gs configurations which are random with no long - range ordering except for 6 configurations composed of 3 configurations by stacking of up - spin planes and down - spin planes , alternately in @xmath15 , or @xmath118 or @xmath119 direction and 3 configurations due to the global reversal of all spins .",
    "when @xmath16 increases from zero , the system selects these 6 long - range gs configurations .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the selection of  order by disorder \" @xcite which has been numerically verified in a large number of systems @xcite .",
    "the selection of the long - range order is due to the entropy term which makes an extremely small difference with the other nearly - degenerate random configurations .",
    "it is not therefore surprising that the introduction of even a very small amount of ferromagnetic bonds breaks immediately the long - range order .",
    "\\iv ) it is interesting to note that we have observed two regions of reentrant phase at @xmath120 and @xmath121 , bounded at the upper limit by the dotted lines . in these regions , at a given @xmath0 the magnetization is small at low @xmath16 and becomes zero when crossing the dotted line , below the transition line determined by the vanishing edwards - anderson order parameter @xmath100 .",
    "the dotted lines are determined using the temperatures at which the magnetization ( or sublattice magnetization for af side ) vanish for different @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ reentrance ] .",
    "note that , depending on the system , there are several complex mechanisms leading to reentrant phases as seen in exactly solved ising models @xcite .",
    "to study the relaxation of the freezing order parameter in the  steady \" regime ( after equilibration time @xmath99 ) , let us define the following quantities @xmath122 where @xmath123 indicates a sum over @xmath124 mc steps per spin starting from @xmath11 and @xmath125 indicates a sum over the system sites . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mq ] ) , @xmath126 is the average of @xmath127 calculated over all successive intervals of @xmath124 steps until the end of the total run time @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath126 is thus averaged with @xmath128 intervals , taking @xmath129 and @xmath130 , for instance .",
    "note that @xmath124 is nothing but the so - called  waiting time \" when measuring the system relaxation .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath131 is in fact the autocorrelation function .",
    "this is seen by writing the autocorrelation of the spin @xmath37 after a waiting time @xmath124 as @xmath132 from which we obtain @xmath131 by summing over all spins .",
    "when @xmath133 we have @xmath134 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xp0500 ] , the magnetization @xmath102 is zero at any @xmath16 for @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to calculate the susceptibility defined by the variance of @xmath102 .",
    "however , we can do that for @xmath126 : @xmath135 . of course , the result of @xmath109 will depend on @xmath124 .",

    "finally , we note that we studied here a dozen bond configurations of size @xmath167 . at this large number of bonds , statistical fluctuations between samples",
    "are almost zero .",
    "we did not study therefore the size effect on the relaxation time in the present paper , reserving a priority for simulations using the whole range of ferromagnetic bond concentration which took an enormous cpu time .",
    "in addition , we did not study sg exponents such as @xmath168 and @xmath119 ( dynamic exponent ) so the finite - size scaling is not necessary at this stage .",
    "we believe however that our results on the phase diagram and the relaxation time remain valid for larger sizes .",
    "size effects in sg are certainly much smaller than in pure systems because of the existence of different correlation lengths at the glass transition due to different degrees of local disorders , in the same manner as the existence of many different exponential relaxation times whose superposition leads to the slow ser .",
    "it is however very interesting to study the finite - size scaling to calculate the universality class of a system having a first - order transition after its crossover to a second - order due to the introduction of a random bond disorder .",
    "this problem is left for a future study .",
