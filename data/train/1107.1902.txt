    "nuclear - polarized @xmath0he has proven to be useful in a number of different areas of research . in electron scattering , polarized @xmath0he provides a means for studying spin - dependent interactions involving neutrons .",
    "this is because , to first approximation , a @xmath0he nucleus is comprised of two protons whose spins are paired , and a single neutron that accounts for most of the nuclear spin  @xcite .",
    "an important early example of the use of polarized @xmath0he in electron scattering came during an experiment to measure the internal spin structure of the neutron at the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) , e142  @xcite . polarized",
    "@xmath0he has also been used to measure the electric form factor of the neutron @xmath2 , including a recent experiment at jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) in newport news , va  @xcite .",
    "important applications of polarized @xmath0he have also included its use as a neutron polarizer  @xcite , and , together with polarized @xmath3xe , as a source of signal for magnetic resonance imaging  @xcite .",
    "there are two predominant techniques by which high levels of nuclear polarization are produced in @xmath0he . in one technique , often known as metastability exchange optical pumping ( meop ) , metastable states of @xmath0he",
    "are optically pumped directly , and subsequently transfer their polarization to other ground - state @xmath0he nuclei during metastability - exchange collisions  @xcite . in a second technique , known as spin - exchange optical pumping ( seop ) , a vapor of alkali - metal atoms is optically pumped and subsequently transfers its polarization to @xmath0he nuclei via a hyperfine interaction during spin - exchange collisions  @xcite . an important difference between the two techniques is that meop is performed at pressures that are quite low , around a few torr , whereas seop is often done at pressures as high as roughly ten atmospheres .",
    "when a high - density is required , a target based on meop inevitably involves a compressor of some sort .",
    "in contrast , high - density targets based on seop typically utilize a sealed glass cell with no moving parts and hence have an advantage from the perspective of simplicity . in considering relative merits ,",
    "however , one also needs to consider the speed with which the gas is polarized . here",
    "targets based on meop have done quite well , with a recent target at the mainz microtron reporting a polarization rate of 2 bar - liters per hour@xcite . in short , both techniques for polarizing @xmath0he have been quite successful and have complimentary advantages .    for electron - scattering experiments",
    "in which @xmath0he is polarized using seop , the targets typically utilize a sealed glass cell with two distinct chambers : a  pumping chamber \" in which the gas is polarized , and a  target chamber \" through which the electron beam passes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : genstyle ] ) .",
    "this design ensures that ionization due to the electron beam does not adversely affect the optical pumping process , as well as providing in the pumping chamber a geometry that lends itself well to illumination with lasers .",
    "the two chambers are connected by a  transfer tube \" , and gas that is polarized in the pumping chamber migrates into the target chamber largely by diffusion .",
    "several conditions need to be met in targets with designs such as that shown in fig .  1 in order to maintain high polarization .",
    "first , the rate at which the @xmath0he is polarized must be relatively fast compared to the rate at which the @xmath0he is depolarized . while this is true in all work involving seop , it is of particular significance when considering depolarization of the @xmath0he due to an electron beam .",
    "there are also issues having to do with polarization dynamics that are unique to the two - chamber design . as has been pointed out by chupp _",
    "et al._@xcite , it is important that diffusion between the two chambers is rapid compared to other @xmath0he - related time constants in the system . as we will show in detail ,",
    "a matter of special importance is maximizing the ratio of the diffusion rate to the relaxation rate that is specific to the target chamber .",
    "put differently , it is critical that the polarized gas in the target chamber is replenished much faster than it is depleted through depolarization mechanisms such as , for example , ionization from the electron beam .",
    "a failure to replenish the polarized gas quickly enough will result in a lower polarization in the target chamber than is the case in the pumping chamber , a condition we refer to herein as a _",
    "polarization gradient_.    until relatively recently , polarization gradients in two - chambered cells have been at most a few percent relative .",
    "advances in seop , however , have made it possible to run polarized @xmath0he targets at increasingly high luminosities . during slac e142 , where luminosities were in the range of @xmath4 ,",
    "the polarization gradients were on the order of 1% . during recent experiments at jlab , however , with luminosities in the range of @xmath5 , polarization gradients were as high as nearly 9% ( relative ) . for future experiments with luminosities in the range of @xmath6 , polarization gradients well in excess of 10% are likely if no changes are made to the basic target - cell design .",
    "polarization gradients can also be difficult to quantify accurately , an issue that can lead to uncertainties in polarimetry .",
    "the fact that polarized @xmath0he targets are being run at increasingly high luminosities is due largely to advances in seop .",
    "one example is the use of hybrid mixtures of alkali metals ( typically potassium and rubidium ) instead of a single alkali metal ( typically rubidium)@xcite .",
    "this technique , often known as alkali - hybrid seop , greatly improves the efficiency with which the @xmath0he is polarized .",
    "another important advance has followed from the availability of commercial spectrally - narrowed high - power diode - laser arrays .",
    "these new lasers result in significantly higher optical pumping rates for a given amount of light .",
    "collectively , these advances have made it possible to significantly increase the rate at which the @xmath0he is polarized .",
    "it has thus become possible to achieve higher polarizations even when using higher beam currents and thicker targets .",
    "higher currents , however , make it necessary to replenish the polarized gas in the target chamber more quickly . if the advances in seop are to be fully exploited , it is essential that the designs of polarized @xmath0he targets evolve .",
    "we report here on the successful implementation of a new design for polarized @xmath0he target cells based on seop .",
    "the design incorporates the ability to circulate the gas between the pumping chamber and the target chamber using convection instead of diffusion , an idea discussed by wojtsekhowski in ref .",
    "@xcite in anticipation of both advances in seop as well as the need for higher luminosities",
    ". the convection is achieved by maintaining a temperature differential between different parts of the target cell , and does not involve pumps or other moving parts .",
    "we have shown that the velocity of the gas moving through the target chamber can be varied between 580@xmath7 in a simple controllable manner .",
    "the advent of a means to circulate a polarized noble gas in a sealed vessel without the use of pumps has great potential for high - luminosity polarized @xmath0he targets .",
    "the simplicity of the approach has advantages from the perspective of reliability , and fast transport of gas between the two chambers makes it possible to greatly increase the electron beam current without causing a polarization gradient .",
    "convection - based target cells also open the possibility of physically separating the pumping chamber and the target chamber by much larger distances than was previously possible , something that offers several practical advantages .",
    "before considering the formalism for target cells with two chambers , we begin by considering the simpler example of a single - chambered cell , where the equation describing the time evolution of the polarization is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath0he polarization , @xmath10 is the polarization of the alkali vapor , @xmath11 is the rate at which the @xmath0he is polarized due to spin exchange , and @xmath12 is the spin - relaxation rate of the @xmath0he due to all other processes .",
    "the solution to eqn.[eq : singlecell ] is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the @xmath0he polarization at @xmath15 .",
    "it has been shown by babcock _",
    "_ that one of the components of @xmath12 is a relaxation rate that empirically appears to be proportional to @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "one can accordingly write that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a proportionality constant .",
    "we can thus write the saturation polarization associated with eqn .",
    "[ eqn : psingle ] as @xmath18 where we note that the denominator of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : psingle_w_x ] is also the rate that characterizes the buildup of polarization in [ eqn : psingle ] , rewritten in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath17 .",
    "the existence of a relaxation mechanism proportional to @xmath11 is unfortunate , as it implies that , even with a 100% polarized alkali vapor , in the limit that @xmath20 , @xmath21 . while not well understood ,",
    "the existence of this additional relaxation is now well established , and is important for understanding the overall polarization achieved .",
    "it is straightforward to project the performance of a target at an arbitrary range of beam currents if we know how it performed at a particular beam current @xmath22 ( true even if @xmath23 ) .",
    "let us assume that we have data describing polarization as a function of time while polarizing a target from an initial polarization of zero .",
    "a plot of data of this sort is something we refer to herein as a ",
    "spin - up curve \" , and can be fit to yield the  spin - up rate \" that appears in the denominator of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : psingle_w_x ] ( as well as the exponent in eqn .",

    "[ eqn : psingle_w_x ] , we define a quantity @xmath25 that characterizes the spin - up rate at a particular current @xmath26 : @xmath27 let us further define @xmath28 as the equilibrium polarization associated with that spin - up . using eqns .",
    "[ eqn : psingle_w_x ] and [ eq : gamma_su_def ] , we find @xmath29 the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath25 can be determined by fitting data from a spin up , and the quantity @xmath30 , where the three terms are spin - relaxation rates due to wall collisions ( at room temperature ) , dipole interactions due to @xmath0he-@xmath0he collisions , and ionization of the electron beam respectively .",
    "the sum of the first two terms is essentially the target s room - temperature spin - relaxation rate in the absence of beam , a quantity that is quite easy to measure .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath31 will be slightly different under operating conditions than it is at room temperature both because of heating the pumping chamber and the related differences in densities .",
    "this correction is easily calculated using the calculation of newbury _",
    "et al . _ from ref .",
    "the contribution @xmath32 is also easily computed  @xcite",
    ". we note that calculations of @xmath32 have shown good agreement with experiment at a level of roughly 10% or better  @xcite .",
    "we can thus use eqn .",
    "[ eq : model ] to project the performance of a particular target at an arbitrary beam current .",
    "it is instructive to investigate how different targets that have been used during past experiments would fare at significantly increased current , for example , at @xmath33 .",
    "here we ignore the effect of polarization gradients .",
    "the first time liter - type quantities of polarized @xmath0he were used in a target was the aforementioned experiment at slac , e142  @xcite .",
    "in the presence of @xmath34 of electron beam , the @xmath0he polarization averaged about 33% , with values for @xmath35 of about 15 - 20 hours . if this same target were instead exposed to @xmath33 of electron beam , eqn .",
    "[ eq : model ] suggests that the @xmath0he polarization would drop to just over 10% . in contrast , during the more recent experiment at jlab that measured @xmath2  @xcite , the cell - averaged polarizations were around 50% with @xmath36 of beam and @xmath35 was in the range of @xmath37 . here",
    "[ eq : model ] suggests that at @xmath33 the resulting @xmath0he polarization would be around 3738% .",
    "the improved projected performance is due both to the shorter values for @xmath35 , as well as the fact that the target cells were significantly larger , making them more resistant to depolarization from the electron beam .",
    "we note , however , that even though the cell - averaged polarization would be fairly reasonable , the polarization that one would have in the target chamber would be much lower because of polarization gradients .",
    "for a full description of a double - chambered cell , the polarization build up must be described by the coupled differential equations first described in ref .",

    "the uncertainties in @xmath42 , and consequently @xmath119 , can in some situations translate into a systematic uncertainty in polarimetry .",
    "one of the best techniques for determining the absolute polarization of @xmath0he is the method of measuring shifts in the electron paramagnetic resonance frequencies of the alkali - metal atoms due to the effective magnetic field caused by the polarized @xmath0he  @xcite .",
    "this can only be performed in the pumping chamber ( where significant alkali - metal vapor is present ) , despite the fact that the quantity of interest in an electron scattering experiment is the polarization in the target chamber .",

    "when this is done , the calibration requires a knowledge of @xmath119 . for the case of the targets used in the @xmath2 experiment discussed earlier ,",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath119 , following the prescription described earlier , translated into a 12% ( relative ) uncertainty in polarimetery . while not catastrophic , such systematic uncertainties would be nice to avoid .",
    "two points emerge regarding polarization gradients : 1 ) they limit target polarization at high beam currents , and 2 ) they are somewhat uncertain in their size , which in some circumstances , results in systematic uncertainties in polarimetry . if we want to make polarization gradients smaller while retaining the basic cell design illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : genstyle ] , there are two things that can be considered : increasing the cross sectional area of the transfer tube and decreasing the length of the transfer tube .",
    "we note that with the large - volume cells that are more resistant to beam current , design constraints make it difficult to significantly shorten the transfer tube , and they are currently at most 50% longer than the shortest lengths used in early two - chambered targets such as those employed during e142 .",

    "if the cell - averaged polarization were around 70% with no beam ( more on this in section iv ) , and 62% in beam , the polarization in the target chamber would be about 55% .",
    "in addition to the reduction of the in - beam polarization , the gradients would also have the potential of introducing uncertainties in polarimetry at the level of 24% .",
    "in short , this hypothetical design falls well short of optimized performance . and",
    "while we have assumed here the same transfer - tube length as is shown in fig .",
    "1 , as will be discussed more in section iv , there are compelling reasons to increase the distance between the pumping and target chambers .",
    "this would naturally require a longer transfer tube , something that would further aggravate the problem of polarization gradients .",

    "the aforementioned polarization gradients can be made negligible , even if the distance between the pumping and target chambers is substantially increased .      to demonstrate the feasibility of convection - driven polarized @xmath0he target cells , we have constructed a prototype with the geometry and dimensions illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : convectionstyle ] .",

    "the pumping chamber also contained several tens of milligrams of a hybrid mixture of potassium and rubidium .",
    "the @xmath0he gas in the new prototype was polarized in the same manner as in our other target cells .",
    "the pumping chamber was surrounded by a forced - hot - air oven , constructed largely out of ceramic and glass . while polarizing the @xmath0he , the oven was maintained at temperatures that were typically between @xmath145c , resulting in a vapor pressure of alkali - metal atoms corresponding to a number density on the order of @xmath146 .",
    "the rubidium atoms were optically pumped using laser light from high - power diode - laser arrays with a wavelength of 795  nm , and as described in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , quickly shared their polarization with the potassium atoms that were also present .",
    "subsequent spin - exchange collisions with the @xmath0he atoms resulted in the buildup of substantial nuclear polarization .",
    "the temperature differential used to induce convection was maintained by using a second forced - hot - air  convection heater \" , installed on one of the transfer tubes as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : convectionstyle ] ( we note that , in reality , the convection heater also covered much of the horizontal portion of the transfer tube , but that this portion contributed negligibly to the speed of the convection ) . with a portion of one of the transfer tubes at an elevated temperature , the gas contained therein had a lower density than the corresponding gas in the other transfer tube , and thus experienced a small buoyant force which induced convection . by controlling the temperature of the convection heater , the gas flow could be controlled in a stable and reproducible fashion .",
    "the flow of the gas was monitored using an nmr tagging technique . a  slug \" of gas within a small section of one of the transfer tubes",
    "was depolarized by subjecting it to a pulse of rf tuned to the larmor frequency of the @xmath0he nuclei .",
    "the rf was delivered using a small coil ( labeled in fig .",
    "[ fig : convectionstyle ] as the  zapper coil \" ) wrapped directly around one of the transfer tubes .",
    "nmr signals were then detected at each of four locations along the target chamber as indicated on fig .",
    "[ fig : convectionstyle ] using small  pickup coils \" . the movement of the slug of gas",
    "could then be tracked by monitoring nmr signals from each of the four pickup coils .",

    "time zero in this plot corresponds to the moment when a slug of gas was tagged .",
    "-.3truein    it is readily apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : zapper ] that a transient dip occurs in each of the signals from the four pickup coils .",
    "this dip corresponds to the passage of the depolarized slug of gas , and it can be seen that the transient occurs at successively later times for each of coils 14 . given the known positions of the regularly spaced pickup coils , the difference in time between the transients associated with each of the four pickup coils provides a measure of the speed with which the tagged slug of gas was moving .",
    "the measurement illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : zapper ] corresponds to a target - chamber gas velocity of @xmath147 .    also apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : zapper ] is the fact that each successive dip becomes wider and more shallow .",

    "that is , the velocity as a function of the distance @xmath148 from the middle of the tube has the functional form @xmath149 .",
    "hence , the slug of gas , which is initially fairly localized to the region around the  zapper coil \" , becomes increasingly spread out as it moves through the target chamber .",
    "additional spreading also occurs because of diffusion .",
    "we note also that the nmr signal decreases as a function of time .",
    "this is due largely to polarization losses that occur with each afp measurement .",
    "while the loss from each individual measurement is quite small ( on the order of 1% ) , the accumulation of many such losses is quite substantial .",

    "more importantly , the agreement is more than sufficient to suggest that we have an acceptable quantitative understanding of the parameters influencing the convective flow from a practical perspective .",
    "-0.3truein      ultimately , the value of a convection - driven target cell is measured by the degree to which polarization gradients can be avoided between the pumping chamber and the target chamber .",
    "it is critical that , as gas is depolarized by an electron beam , freshly polarized gas is delivered from the pumping chamber sufficiently quickly . ideally , one would like the ratio of the polarizations of the two chambers to be as close to unity as possible . fortunately ,",
    "when convection is used to transfer gas between chambers , the polarization gradient is suppressed because the transfer rates are quite high .    for the range of velocities measured in fig .",
    "[ fig : convectiondata ] , we find values for @xmath43 in the range of 4.9  81 hrs@xmath90 .",
    "even with relatively fast relaxation in the target chamber ( for example , consider @xmath191hrs@xmath90 ) , the polarization gradient ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : delta ] ) will be very small in the presence of such fast transfer rates ( @xmath192 , or @xmath193 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : brady ] , the @xmath0he polarization in both chambers of a traditional target cell is plotted as a function of time .",
    "the ratio of target chamber to pumping chamber polarization for this plot begins at zero , and gradually climbs to a value significantly less than unity , reflecting a substantial polarization gradient . in fig .",
    "[ fig : convectionratio ] , we plot this ratio for a convection - driven cell for three different operating conditions . in all cases ,",
    "the temperature of the oven was held at @xmath194 .",
    "the three curves correspond to different temperatures @xmath166 of the heated transfer tube . for the data shown with the open squares , the transfer - tube set temperature was @xmath195 , the same as the other ( unheated ) transfer tube .",
    "this case corresponds to no driven convection , and is associated with a polarization gradient of 8% . for the data shown with the filled triangles and the filled circles , the set temperatures were @xmath196 and @xmath197 respectively .",
    "these two conditions corresponded to target - chamber gas velocities of approximately 19.9 cm / min and 48.5 cm / min . in both of these cases , the ratio of the polarizations of the target chamber and the pumping chamber quickly reached a value approaching unity .",
    "it is notable that there is very little difference between these last two curves despite substantially different gas velocities . in short , as soon as convection rather than diffusion is responsible for the gas transfer between the two chambers , polarization is relatively uniform throughout the cell .",
    "with advances in seop , it is now possible to run polarized @xmath0he targets at significantly higher luminosities .",
    "using a single transfer tube , however , even currently approved experiments would suffer polarization gradients of 12% or worse , and subsequent experiments at even higher luminosities would be even more limited .",
    "the work described here demonstrates that with only minor changes to current designs , convection - based cells can be built in which polarization gradients are extremely small .    in many ways ,",
    "however , the most compelling reason to adopt convection - based cells is the enormous flexibility that is gained in being able to choose the distance between the pumping and target chambers .",
    "experience has shown that the probability of a cell rupturing goes up markedly after 46 weeks exposure to something on the order of @xmath198 of beam .",
    "most commonly , the part of the cell that breaks is the pumping chamber .",
    "stress in a sphere goes up linearly with the radius .",
    "this makes the relatively large pumping chamber particularly vulnerable to radiation damage . with convection - based cells the distance between the pumping chamber and the target chamber",
    "can be greatly increased with minimal implications for performance . among other things ,",
    "it becomes practical to incorporate radiation shielding for the pumping chamber .",
    "there are at least two additional reasons that flexibility in the configuration of target cells is highly desirable .",
    "as discussed earlier , the primary way to make targets more tolerant of beam is to make them larger .",
    "the more gas that is being polarized per unit time , the less relevant it is that some small portion of that gas is being depolarized by the beam .",
    "it is not practical , however , to make the pumping chamber arbitrarily large . as the stress in the glass walls increases , the cell becomes more prone to rupturing , even if the wall thickness is increased .",
    "furthermore , the intensity of the optical pumping radiation goes like total power over the square of the radius while the volume goes like the cube of the radius .",
    "hence , since the required laser power scales with volume , the required intensity of light scales linearly with radius .",
    "there are already indications that we are near a threshold at which laser intensity damages the cells from the perspective of spin relaxation .",
    "if multiple pumping chambers were used instead of one , it would become possible to limit both laser intensity and the size of each individual pumping chamber .",
    "if diffusion were the only mechanism for moving polarized gas inside the target , the implementation of multiple pumping chambers would be quite challenging .",
    "we close by citing a concrete example that underscores the desirability of adopting convection - based target cells .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : bradyspinup ] results from a bench test of the cell  brady \" ( discussed earlier ) in which the primary goal was to achieve the highest polarization possible .",
    "brady , like the the targets used for the @xmath2 measurements  @xcite , contained an alkali - hybrid mixture of k and rb .",
    "unlike during the @xmath2 experiment , however , the results shown in fig .  [ fig : bradyspinup ] were obtained using diode - laser arrays that were spectrally - narrowed such that their line widths were about ten times narrower than their broadband counterparts .",
    "the polarization in this test saturated just over 70% .",
    "brady was one of two target cells used to collect data on single - spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering , and was similar in design , although slightly smaller , than the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : genstyle ] . during the experiment ,",
    "the in - beam polarization of the @xmath0he averaged around 55%  @xcite , despite the fact that the cell - averaged polarization , averaged over the entire experiment , was over 60% .",
    "if the targets used for this experiment had had convection - based gas mixing ( which was just being explored at the time ) , significant gains in performance would have resulted .",
    "-0.2truein    in conclusion , with the advances in target performance brought about by a combination of alkali - hybrid spin - exchange optical pumping and spectrally - narrowed diode - laser arrays , the point has been reached when it is desirable to explore target - cell geometries that go beyond that shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we suggest that the convection - based gas mixing demonstrated in this work can play an important role in implementing high - luminosity polarized @xmath0he targets in the future . not only will the use of convection reduce polarization gradients , it will also make possible greater flexibility in the placement of the pumping chamber with respect to the target chamber . among other things ,",
