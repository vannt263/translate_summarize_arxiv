    "in recent years an intensive research on networks structure and dynamics @xcite was conducted , motivated both with theoretical reasons and practical applications to improve network s performance , for instance in the communication networks .",
    "it has been recognized that network structure may influence the course of the dynamic processes on it through the _ topological constraints _ fixed by network complex patterns of links and higher topological sub - structures .",
    "certain types of processes run better on networks with higher structural complexity @xcite , whereas other processes , like synchronization @xcite , are more efficiently accomplished on homogeneous structures . in this respect , a range of structure  function matching possibilities opens , depending on the details of the dynamics @xcite .    in the case of transport of information packets",
    "two markedly different structures were found @xcite corresponding to minimized travel time of packets : a scale - free structure at low traffic density , and a homogeneous structure at high traffic density . the highly clustered scale - free graph was also found to support efficient free - flow traffic with the local navigation rules compatible with the `` information horizon '' of the graph @xcite .",
    "the emergent efficiency of transport is related to the central role of the hub and its associated super - structure @xcite . however , the structure is vulnerable for jamming when the creation rate exceeds a ( large ) critical value @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "a homogeneous network with distributed node activity is expected to perform better @xcite .",
    "apart from the limitation to _ free graphs _",
    "( i.e. , graphs in the infinite space dimension ) and relatively low transparency of the simulated annealing procedure at large networks , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite revealed main structure  traffic interdependences and traced routes towards improved efficiency of transport processes on complex networks .",
    "the following questions remain open :    * what topological property on a small scale of the underlying network plays the key role in given dynamics ? * how these globally optimal topologies perform in the case of traffic with constraints of restricted geometries ?",
    "here we address these questions using numerical simulations to study comparatively two types of transport processes on a _ homogeneous planar graph with scale - free distribution of loops_. in particular , we study : ( 1 ) traffic of information packets between specified pairs of nodes on the graph at constant packet density ( fixed number of moving packets ) @xmath1 ; and ( 2 ) transport of electrons via tunneling between nodes , which are driven by the constant voltage difference @xmath2 on electrodes . in both cases the transported packet ( electron )",
    "has a specified source and sink as a pair of nodes on the graph .",
    "the packets are navigated locally towards their destination ( sink ) node , whereas the electrons are driven globally by the voltage profile .",
    "another important difference in these processes is that the information packets interact by making queues on a node .",
    "in contrast , the number of electrons on a node is practically unrestricted and order of their processing is random .",
    "we determine quantitative characteristics of these two processes on the same network ( fixed by its adjacency matrix ) and attempt to relate the statistical properties of transport to the microscopic process rules .",
    "in contrast to the above mentioned networks in _ infinite dimensional space _ , we consider here a graph that is constrained to a _",
    "planar geometry_. we also fix the number of links per node to strictly @xmath0 , in order to minimize the effects of node connectivity . our main findings are that in transport on planar graphs the key topological feature is the betweenness centrality of nodes .",
    "different processes utilize the underlying structure in different ways leading to statistically different outcomes .",
    "the observed traffic properties can be further related to certain features of the microscopic dynamics , specifically to queuing and driving details .    in section",
    "ii we present the graph structure and its main topological characteristics @xcite .",
    "section iii defines the transport processes and their numerical implementation on the graph .",
    "main features of the traffic noise are considered in section iv , and relation between the topological and dynamical centrality measures are studied in section v. section vi contains a short summary and the discussion of the results .",
    "planar graphs are mathematical objects that can be embedded into an euclidean plane . they obey the following topological constraints @xcite : a graph is planar _ iff it does not contain a subdivision of @xmath3 ( 5-clique ) and @xmath4 structures _ , and the euler relation @xmath5 between the number of polygons @xmath6 , nodes @xmath7 , and links @xmath8 is satisfied .",
    "we grow a planar graph by _ cell aggregation _ procedure , which we introduced earlier @xcite . here",
    "we observe a strict constraint of node connectivity @xmath0 for all nodes enclosed in the graph interior .",
    "the cells are loops of nodes with varying lengths @xmath9 driven from a power - law distribution @xmath10 .",
    "the aggregation is starting from an initial loop and nesting additional loops along the boundary of the graph . in order to observe the constraint of maximum connectivity @xmath0",
    ", a nesting place along the graph boundary is searched and its length @xmath11 is identified as the distance between two successive nodes with connectivity @xmath12 . then the nesting is performed with a probability @xmath13 , where @xmath14 represents the excess number of nodes , defined as the difference between current loop length @xmath15 and the length of the selected nesting string @xmath11 .",
    "the number of nodes that are successfully nested are identified with the existing @xmath11 nodes along the nesting site on the graph boundary . in this way the parameter @xmath16 plays the role of the chemical potential for addition of nodes .",
    "in general , when @xmath17 is small , the probability of adding a large number of new nodes @xmath14 attached to a short nesting site is larger , resulting in a more branched graph structures , compared with more homogeneously space - filling loops obtained for large @xmath16 values @xcite .",
    "an example of the structure for large @xmath17 and @xmath18 is shown in fig .  1 ( left ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     additional details of the quantitative analysis",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_betw_rank ] .",
    "the inhomogeneous betweenness of nodes results in a broad ranking - statistics curve ( stretched - exponential ) and a broad distribution of betweenness ( fig .",
    "[ fig_betw_rank]b ) . compared to the topological betweenness , the dynamical betweenness ( or flow ) , which is defined as number of packets processed by a node , in the case of packet transport appears to be more even in the node ranking statistics .",
    "the picture is compatible with the random walk dynamics , in which all nodes become almost equally busy in the transport process .",
    "this results in a narrow distribution of the dynamical information - flow betweenness , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_betw_rank]b . in the case of electron tunneling ,",
    "the profile of the ranked dynamical betweenness of nodes is steeper , and consequently the distribution broader , compared to the topological betweenness .",
    "the reason is the directed flow of electrons between the electrodes , and additionally , the reduced active part of the graph , due to the selected position of the electrodes .",
    "the difference between these two processes is also illustrated by their maximum - dynamic - flow spanning trees , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ figgraphs_flowtrees ] .",
    "obviously , the two dynamic processes use the underlying graph topology in different ways .",
    "nevertheless , the nodes with maximum topological betweenness are often placed along the central line on the dynamic flow trees , suggesting the key role of these nodes in both transport processes .",
    "we have studied two dynamic processes on a homogeneous planar graph with scale - free loops in which we demonstrated several aspects of _ constraints in the network dynamics_. first , the growth of the graph is constrained to a planar geometry and fixed node connectivity .",
    "this results in a non - small world graph , in which topological betweenness centrality of nodes ( links ) appears to be inhomogeneous , making the basis for nontrivial dynamical effects .",
    "second , the graph s geometry makes the constraints to the dynamic processes .    in the two types of diffusion processes ",
    "information packet flow and voltage - driven electron - tunneling  which take part between pairs of nodes on the graph , details of the dynamics result in different use of the underlying graph topology .",
    "the relevant features at microscopic scale are , on one side , random - walk dynamics with queuing of information packets , against directed transport of electrons with global constraint on the number of electrons at a node , on the other . in particular , we demonstrated the emergent quantitative difference in noise correlations , universal noise fluctuations and return - time statistics , and in the respective dynamical maximum - flow spanning trees . our numerical data , for instance for the return - time distributions and the noise fluctuations , appear to be well fitted with theoretical expressions suggested in different concepts of the complex dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the full understanding of the occurrence of these laws in the transport on networks remains elusive .",
    "we hope that our numerical study may serve as a basis for further theoretical research to unravel the role of constraints in the dynamic processes on networks .",
