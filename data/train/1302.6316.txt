    "recently , the thermodynamics of a unitary gas of fermionic atoms has been in the focus of experimental investigations @xcite . in a unitary gas , the inter - atomic interaction between neutral fermionic atoms",
    "is adjusted using the feshbach resonance @xcite , so that the scattering length goes to @xmath0 .",
    "such a gas has properties that are universal or scale independent @xcite .",
    "the experimental confirmation of the universal nature of the equation of state ( eos ) of a gas of neutral fermionic atoms has therefore given fresh impetus to its theoretical understanding @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , an ansatz for the grand potential of a spin balanced two - component fermion gas was introduced through a virial expansion in powers of the fugacity variable @xmath1 .",
    "this ansatz for the interaction part of the virial coefficients could fit the experimental data up to about @xmath2 , surprising in view of the fact that it was meant to be a high temperature expansion for small @xmath1 . for @xmath3 ,",
    "i.e. , at low temperatures , the virial expansion was found to become unphysical .    in this paper",
    "we propose a novel phenomenological approach to describe the eos , that agrees with experimental data all the way to very low temperatures and reproduces some of the zero temperature properties quantitatively .",
    "following sommerfeld @xcite , it would seem that at low temperatures when @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a more suitable expansion parameter . since a unitary gas introduces no extra length scales than already present in the ideal gas , we go one step further and express the grand potential in terms of a simple combination of two fermi - dirac integrals @xcite .",
    "this allows us to fit the experimental data quite accurately , and at the same time to reproduce the correct second virial coefficient at small @xmath1 , i.e. , for high temperatures .",
    "furthermore , experimentally , a phase transition to super - fluidity is observed around @xmath6 , evidenced by peaks in the heat capacity and compressibility @xcite . to reproduce these features in our model",
    ", we introduce a phenomenological term in the grand partition function , which in the zero - width limit yields a singularity in the free energy and hence describes a phase transition .    in sec .",
    "ii , we first introduce our new phenomenological ansatz and show that it reproduces the universal function @xmath7 , which is the ratio of pressures of the spin - balanced two - component unitary gas and free fermi gas , over a large range of experimentally available fugacities @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "iii , we compute all the thermodynamic quantities for which experimental data are available and show that our phenomenological ansatz indeed incorporates the essential features of the data .",
    "the grand potential @xmath8 of the unitary gas is related to the grand partition function @xmath9 by the thermodynamical relation @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are pressure and volume , respectively , @xmath13 is the temperature , and @xmath14 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the grand partition function is defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the canonical @xmath17 particle partition function .",
    "note that in the above series , the dependences on @xmath18 and @xmath1 are mixed .",
    "however , for the ideal free fermi gas , @xmath9 has the form @xmath19 in which the @xmath1 dependence has separated out and is entirely coming through the function @xmath20 which is one of the fermi - dirac integrals defined @xcite as @xmath21    for a unitary gas , a similar separation of variables @xmath18 and @xmath1 also takes place @xcite .",
    "we therefore define a universal function @xmath22 by @xmath23 in terms of this function , we define the universal thermodynamic function @xmath7 by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the grand potential and pressure of the untrapped ideal fermi gas , respectively .",
    "note that in this quantity the dependence on temperature and length scales drops out , so that it is universal and scale independent ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the all - important function @xmath27 encodes the thermodynamic properties of the unitary gas of fermionic atoms .",
    "we make the important assumption that @xmath27 can be written as a linear superposition of fermi - dirac integrals since this ensures universality .",
    "thus we introduce the function @xmath27 through the following phenomenological ansatz : @xmath28+g(x)\\ , , \\label{eqn3}\\ ] ] where the factor 2 in front accounts for spin degeneracy .",
    "this ansatz is further guided by the following considerations :    \\1 .",
    "the function @xmath29 obeys universality , i.e. , it depends only on the fugacity @xmath30 , but not on any length scale or other system variable .",
    "the leading term @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) is simply that of the free non - interacting fermi gas given in eq .",
    "( [ zfree ] ) .",
    "\\3 . the second term @xmath32 describes the contribution from the interactions .",
    "by definition this term does not contribute to the linear term in @xmath1 in the high temperature expansion of @xmath27 ( cf .",
    "furthermore , the linear superposition of fermi - dirac integrals is determined to yield the exact interaction part of the second virial coefficient @xmath33 @xcite in the high temperature limit .",
    "this choice , however , does not yield the correct third virial coefficient that is known to great accuracy , nor the estimated fourth virial coefficient @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the high temperature properties that we obtain still give excellent agreement with experimental results .",
    "on the other hand , the zero temperature properties are entirely determined by the function @xmath31 . the overall factor 5 of @xmath31",
    "allows for a good description also of the zero temperature properties of the unitary gas ( see the detailed discussion to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] below ) .",
    "4 . the function @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) , which is implicitly a function of the fugacity @xmath30 , is introduced in order to describe the phase transition that has been observed in the experimental data @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "we write the grand partition function @xmath9 in the complex @xmath1 plane as @xmath35^{(v/\\lambda^3 ) } ,   \\label{pinch}\\ ] ] with real @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 describes the system without phase transition . at @xmath39 ,",
    "this function goes to zero , causing a logarithmic singularity of the free energy in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "the power @xmath41 of the zeros is required to preserve the universality of @xmath29 . for the function @xmath42 , which is found through eqs .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) and ( [ fp ] ) , this yields @xmath43         + 2\\,\\frac{z}{z_c}\\ , . \\label{eqn4}\\ ] ] the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) is introduced such that @xmath34 gives no contribution to the first - order virial coefficient in the high temperature ( i.e. , small-@xmath1 ) expansion of @xmath27 .",
    "the choice of @xmath36 and @xmath37 is guided by a fit to the experimental data on compressibility and specific heat : while @xmath36 is given by the critical temperature of the phase transition , @xmath37 is governed by the width of the transition region .",
    "we find that @xmath44 and @xmath45 give the best fits to the mit data for compressibility and specific heat , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] below .",
    "while the form ( [ eqn4 ] ) of @xmath34 works well throughout the phase transition region and all the way to small @xmath1 ( i.e. , to high temperatures ) , it becomes unphysical in the zero @xmath13 limit where we are forced to use the ansatz ( [ eqn3 ] ) with @xmath46 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we compare our numerical results with the experimental data of the mit group @xcite for the universal function @xmath29 given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the full expression ( [ eqn3 ] ) for @xmath27 , while the dotted line is obtained using @xmath47 .",
    "we see that the our phenomenological ansatz closely follows the data up to @xmath48 , while the high temperature virial ansatz introduced in @xcite fails much earlier . for large @xmath49 , the results obtained with @xmath47 and with @xmath34 given in ( [ eqn4 ] ) lie on either side of the data , the solid line showing that @xmath34 becomes unphysical for @xmath50 . in all calculations",
    "presented henceforth , we have put it to zero for @xmath51 , corresponding to @xmath52 and a temperature @xmath53 , below which there are essentially no data points found in the figures below .",
    "encouraged by the good agreement over a large range of @xmath49 for our universal function @xmath29 , we now consider the calculation of basic thermodynamic observables . following ku _",
    "@xcite , we write for the normalised pressure @xmath54 where @xmath11 and @xmath55 are pressure and energy , respectively , of the interacting gas .",
    "the quantities used for the normalization in the denomiators above are all evaluated for the non - interacting gas : @xmath56 is the pressure at zero temperature , @xmath57 the fermi temperature , and @xmath58 the fermi energy ; the latter two are related by @xmath59 .",
    "the prime here and below denotes derivative with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "the normalised temperature is given by @xmath60^{2/3}}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn6}\\ ] ] the entropy , also related to pressure , is given by @xmath61 the chemical potential @xmath62 , normalized with respect to the non - interacting fermi energy @xmath58 , is given by @xmath63 analogously , the normalised compressibility is given by @xmath64 the specific heat at constant volume is given by @xmath65 we note that both compressibility and specific heat depend on the second derivatives of the function @xmath27 .",
    "[ fig2 ]    we now present numerical results for the thermodynamic quantities for which experimental data are available . since no ready - to - use numerical routines for the fermi - dirac integrals @xmath66 could be found , we have calculated them by numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "this is easily possible to any desired accuracy for @xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath68 we employed the formula @xcite @xmath69 and used numerical differentiation to obtain @xmath70 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we compare our results of normalised pressure ( top ) , entropy ( middle ) , and chemical potential ( bottom ) with the mit data .",
    "our ansatz describes all these data quite well all the way down to the critical temperature @xmath71 . at high temperatures the results are comparable to , if not better than , the virial ansatz discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "departures are noticed around critical temperature @xmath72 ( enlarged in the inserts ) . like in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the results with and without including @xmath34 lie on opposite sides of the data below @xmath72 ; the solid lines do reproduce the kink seen in the chemical potential at @xmath73 .",
    "we stress again that in eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) with @xmath34=0 , only the contribution @xmath74 is relevant for reproducing the results at @xmath75 . for the energy per particle at @xmath75 it yields @xmath76 , where @xmath77 if the fermi energy of the interacting gas",
    "further , it is easily deduced that @xmath78 , which is slightly less than the experimentally determined value 0.36 of the mit experiment @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our fit of @xmath29 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) is particularly sensitive to the linear combination of @xmath79 and @xmath80 used in our ansatz ( [ eqn3 ] ) , which was primarily chosen to yield a reasonable high temperature limit . any different choice of parameters , or any admixture of fermi - dirac integrals @xmath81 with other orders @xmath82 , could not simultaneously yield both these desirable high- and zero - temperature limits .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the results of our calculations for compressibility ( top ) and specific heat ( bottom ) as functions of temperature .",
    "the resonant term @xmath34 in @xmath27 here gives an excellent description of the experimental peaks seen in both quantities .",
    "again , it has to be cut at @xmath83 , and the result obtained with @xmath47 yields the correct limits @xmath84=@xmath85 and @xmath86=@xmath87 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we finally plot compressibility versus normalised pressure like it was done in ref .",
    "note here , in particular , the excellent agreement with the data up to the highest available pressures .",
    "to summarise , we have introduced a phenomenological function @xmath27 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) that yields the universal equation of state ( [ eqn1 ] ) of a unitary fermion gas .",
    "@xmath27 depends solely on the fugacity @xmath1 ( or on @xmath5 ) and hence is scale independent .",
    "it consists of two fermi - dirac integrals , @xmath31 and @xmath88 , and a resonant term @xmath42 that corresponds to a pair of zeros of the grand partition function in the complex @xmath1 plane , suitable for describing the phase transition observed in the experiments .",
    "the non - resonant fermi - dirac part of @xmath27 is constructed to yield a reasonable high temperature limit by imposing the value @xmath89 of the second virial coefficient @xcite ; it contains otherwise no adjustable parameter . as a bonus",
    ", it also yields zero temperature limits that fit the data .",
    "the only two parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) for the resonant term @xmath34 , have been fitted to the critical temperature @xmath90 and the width of the phase transition found in the mit data for specific heat and compressibility ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath42 diverges for @xmath91 , i.e. , for @xmath92 .",
    "it was therefore put to zero for @xmath51 corresponding to @xmath83 . however , the available data seen in the figures [ fig2 ] - [ fig4 ] are lying at @xmath93 , so that we can claim to describe all these data with our full ansatz ( [ eqn3 ] ) . the only sizeable deviation is found in fig .   [ fig1 ] for the quantity @xmath29 which appears to have been measured even below @xmath94 , and for which our results including @xmath34 take off already above @xmath94 .",
    "nevertheless , we can claim that our ansatz , in spite of its simplicity , describes the overall experimental data surprisingly well . to construct it",
    ", we have mainly used the universal properties of a gas at unitarity , as well as crucial experimental observations .",
