    "there is a number of scenarios in theoretical astrophysics which need to be modelled by means of numerical simulations .",
    "the complexity found in these scenarios does not allow for a simple analytical study to explain the observations . in a subset of these scenarios",
    "the effects of general relativity are important and a newtonian description of the system is not sufficient .",
    "some examples of stellar size scenarios of this kind are : i ) the collapse of massive stellar cores to form a neutron star , which eventually can lead to a supernova explosion , ii ) for more massive stars , the collapse to a black hole and possibly an accretion disk , which can power a long - duration gamma - ray burst ( grb ) according to the collapsar scenario ( woosley 1993 ) and could be related to the subclass of broad - lined type ic supernovae ( modjaz 2008 ) , and iii ) the cooling of a rapidly rotating hot proto - neutron star ( pns ) to form a magnetar ( thomson & duncan 1993 ) .",
    "all three previous examples have in common that are quasi - spherical scenarios .",
    "therefore it is natural to model them in numerical simulations using spherical polar coordinates .",
    "those scenarios have some common points .",
    "the three scenarios include multi - scale physics in which a broad range of length and time scales play an important role . in the supernova core collapse case",
    "the length scales to cover range from the size of the iron core ( @xmath0  km ) to the size of the pns ( @xmath1  km ) .",
    "the smaller length - scale process dominating the dynamics ranges from @xmath2  km in the case of convectively unstable pns formed after the collapse of the most common slow rotating progenitors ( mller & janka 1997 ) , to @xmath3  cm - @xmath3  m if the magneto - rotational instability develops in the collapse of fast rotating progenitors ( cerd - durn 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore the mechanism for the explosion requires an appropriate modeling of the neutrino transport .",
    "the energy deposited by neutrinos behind the shock and the standing accretion - shock instability ( sasi ) probably are crucial for a successful explosion ( marek & janka 2009 ) . in the collapsar scenario strong rotation",
    "is necessary for the formation of a grb .",
    "it allows the generation of an accretion disk around the formed black hole with a low - density funnel along the rotation axis . the relativistic jet which is responsible for the grb",
    "is powered either by mhd processes or by the energy deposition of annihilating neutrinos around the axis ( see e.g. macfadyen 2001 ) . in the first case ,",
    "magneto - rotational instabilities and dynamo processes are most probably responsible for the amplification of the magnetic field during the collapse .",
    "the case of dynamo processes in rapidly rotating pns resembles the modeling of the sun .",
    "the cooling time - scale is of the order of seconds while the rotation period which drives the dynamo processes can be as low as @xmath3  ms reaching magnetic reynolds number of @xmath4 ( thompson & duncan 1993 ) .",
    "the numerical modeling of all scenarios described above require very high resolution to resolve the mri and the turbulence amplifying the magnetic field , full three - dimensional simulations to correctly capture the growth and saturation of the different types of instabilities ( mri , sasi , global mhd instabilities ) , and a time evolution much larger than the characteristic dynamical timescale of the system .",
    "therefore the numerical methods intended to solve this problem should be as less dissipative as possible in order to guarantee that the numerical dissipation is smaller than the expected physical one or , in cases where the computational requirements do not allow this , the global properties of the system show convergence with increasing grid resolution .",
    "the numerical dissipation could be a serious limitation for the successful modeling of objects mentioned above .",
    "it is hence important to have the appropriate scaling with the resolution , which is a necessary property to have scalable numerical codes which can run efficiently in massive parallel computers .",
    "most of the numerical codes performing simulations of these scenarios use eulerian grids , explicit numerical schemes , and a mesh adapted to the problem , mostly with grids in spherical polar coordinates .",
    "eulerian grid - based codes are better suited for these scenarios than lagrangian methods ( e.g. smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) because they allow to use finite - volume conservative schemes .",
    "eulerian methods allow for the correct treatment of arbitrarily high discontinuities and shocks in general relativity ( ibaez 2000 , dimmelmeier 2002 , duez 2003 , shibata 2007 , baiotti 2007 ) , even with magnetic fields ( gammie 2003 , komissarov 2005 , anninos 2005 , antn 2006 ) .",
    "explicit methods are better suited for multidimensional simulations since they are computationally less expensive and easier to parallelize , although they have time - step limitations given by the cfl condition ( courant 1928 , 1967 ) .",
    "spherical polar coordinates have several properties which make them appropriate to model the objects described above : i ) are well adapted for quasi - spherical objects , ii ) allow for accurate conservation of angular momentum , which is not true , in general , for eulerian grids ( see e.g. zink 2008 and fragile 2009 ) , iii ) axisymmetry and spherical symmetry can be easily enforced , and iv ) large radial domains can be covered using non equally spaced radial grids .",
    "these numerical methods have been successfully applied in 1d ( spherical symmetry ) and 2d ( axisymmetry ) simulations .",
    "however the extension to 3d in spherical coordinates suffers from severe time - step restrictions which render simulations unaffordable unless a special treatment of the central and polar regions is used ( see .",
    "e.g mller & janka 1997 )    numerical dissipation effects are present in simulations using eulerian grids due to the discretization of the equations that are solved .",
    "there are several methods to quantify the amount of numerical dissipation of a code based on the measure of the energy losses of the system .",
    "this has been standard practice since the first studies of hydrodynamic turbulence ( e.g. herring 1974 ) due to the necessity of resolving the physical dissipation scales .",
    "there are also studies of the decay of waves in hydrodynamics ( porter 1994 ) and mhd simulations ( e.g. simon & hawley 2009 ) .",
    "more recently the numerical dissipation has been estimated measuring the angular momentum transport by mhd turbulence ( fromang & papaloizou 2007 , simon 2009 ) .",
    "all these methods allow for a simplified numerical setup in where the local dissipation properties of the numerical algorithms can accurately be estimated .",
    "we propose an alternative approach to measure the numerical dissipation that is suitable for global simulations of relativistic stars close to the equilibrium .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the effects of numerical viscosity in simulations with spherical coordinates and study the influence of the grid resolution and the numerical scheme . in",
    "we describe the hydrodynamics equations including physical bulk viscosity in general relativity ( gr ) , in we present a method to estimate numerical dissipation effects in a simplified test case .",
    "we apply this method in to estimate the numerical viscosity of oscillating neutron stars .",
    "we finish the paper in discussing the implications of our numerical results . if is not explicitly mentioned , we use units in which @xmath5 .",
    "greek indices run from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and latin indices from @xmath3 to @xmath7 .",
    "we use the 3 + 1 decomposition of the spacetime in which the metric reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the lapse function , the shift vector and the spatial 3-metric respectively .",
    "in addition we consider the conformally flat condition ( cfc ) approximation ( isenberg 2008 , wilson 1996 ) for the 3-metric @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the conformal factor and @xmath14 the flat 3-metric in spherical coordinates .",
    "this approximation uses the maximal slicing condition and quasi - isotropic coordinates as gauge conditions . under this approximation the resulting system consist in a hierarchy of elliptic equations ( cordero - carrin 2009 ) .    to be able to study numerical dissipation effects",
    "we need a physical counterpart to calibrate our results .",
    "we use for this purpose the bulk viscosity of the fluid .",
    "the energy momentum tensor of a fluid with bulk viscosity ( ehlers 1961 ) is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the rest - mass density , @xmath17 is the specific internal energy , @xmath18 is the 4-velocity of the fluid , @xmath19 is the pressure , @xmath20 is the bulk viscosity , @xmath21 is the expansion of the fluid and @xmath22 .",
    "the bulk viscosity appears as an isotropic term in the energy - momentum tensor in a very similar way to the pressure .",
    "therefore we can define a modified pressure @xmath23 such that the energy - momentum tensor has the same form as a perfect fluid @xmath24 where @xmath25 , being @xmath26 the relativistic specific enthalpy .",
    "using this form of the energy - momentum tensor is easy to modify an existing hydrodynamics code to include bulk viscosity , specially if the next assumptions are taken into account : i ) we approximate the expansion assuming a post - newtonian expansion and small perturbations , @xmath27 where @xmath28 corresponds to first post - newtonian corrections . all the simulations that we run with physical bulk viscosity in this work belong to this regimen .",

    "since the eigenfunctions of the modes are known it is possible to excite very accurately single modes of the system and follow their evolution .",
    "we evolve the system using a polytropic equation of state , therefore , since the system is adiabatic , there are no possible energy losses and the oscillations should keep constant amplitude as long as non - linear effects does not appear . hence ,",
    "any damping observed in the numerical simulation has to be caused by numerical dissipation effects .",
    "we have chosen a system with @xmath38 and initial density @xmath39 .",
    "the equation of state is a polytrope of the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we use a perturbation @xmath43 ( see appendix a ) of the velocity with an amplitude of @xmath44 corresponding to the lowest frequency mode , @xmath45 .",
    "this amplitude is sufficiently small for the oscillations to be considered linear .",
    "we have used second order runge - kutta method for the time evolution in all cases and two different flux formulae , marquina ( donat el al 1998 ) and hll ( harten & van leer 1983 ) .",
    "we have computed all models using different reconstruction techniques ( constant and linear with minmod or mc slope limiters ) and different resolutions ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",

    "the oscillation frequency coincides with the predicted by the linear analysis within @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "it can be seen that the order of the reconstruction has a strong influence in the numerical damping of the system , being much stronger for first order reconstruction ( constant ) than for second order ( minmod or mc ) . in order to quantify this effect we estimate the damping time for each simulation as it is described next . in every case , we first compute the amplitude of @xmath59 as the difference between two consecutive oscillations , @xmath62 . in the right panel of we plot the evolution of the amplitude for the minmod reconstruction case for five different resolutions . for very low resolution , the amplitude of the perturbation falls bellow the round - off error of the code within the duration of the simulation and it saturates .",
    "we fit next the the amplitude of the oscillations to an exponential decay @xmath63 for each model .",

    "the scaling does not change substantially with the flux formula but only with the reconstruction scheme : for constant reconstruction we recover first order convergence and for linear reconstruction ( minmod and mc ) second order .",

    ", the viscosity converges to the value of the added physical viscosity . our method to estimate the bulk viscosity overestimates , in the convergent regime , the real physical viscosity by @xmath77 .",
    "we have checked that the damping time and therefore the viscosity is not affected for a wide range of amplitudes of the perturbation ( @xmath78-@xmath79 ) and hence we can conclude that non - linear effects does not play any role in the damping observed during this test .",

    "the values for the threshold and the atmosphere are @xmath54 and @xmath100 times the initial central density respectively .",
    "we have checked that the results presented here do not change if we decrease the values of these two quantities .",
    "we use three radial domains for the spectral metric solver : two including the star and one compactified domain in the exterior .",
    "each of the domains has either @xmath101 or @xmath102 collocation points for our low and high metric resolution simulations . since the cfc approximation only contains elliptic equations , which are not restricted by the cfl condition , it is not necessary to solve the metric as frequently as the hydrodynamics equations .",
    "we use a metric computation rate of @xmath103 , i.e. we compute the metric once every @xmath103 time step of the hydrodynamics .",
    "we use a parabolic extrapolation of all the metric quantities between consecutive metric computations , which has been shown to provide sufficient accuracy during the evolution ( dimmelmeier 2002 ) .",

    "shows the variation of the viscosity with the radial resolution normalized to the wavelength of the perturbation computed at the center of the star . in general",
    "the viscosity decreases with increasing resolution . however the lowest resolution case with the minmod reconstruction shows an anomalously low numerical viscosity , which we think is an artifact of the low resolution .",
    "we plot the function @xmath110 for comparison .",
    "the general trend is roughly first order decreasing the order for the highest resolution models , although we are using both first and second reconstruction schemes .",
    "the reason for the lower order of convergence is that all reconstruction schemes reduce to first order at discontinuities .",
    "since we encounter a discontinuity at the surface any evolution will inevitably lead to first order convergent results .",
    "this is also a strong indication that the main numerical dissipation process in the neutron star evolution is probably due to the surface of the star , and therefore increasing the reconstruction order does not decreases the mean numerical viscosity responsible for the damping of global oscillations .",
    "we have checked the influence of the cfl factor , the metric calculation rate and the 2d effects for simulations with @xmath61 radial points , marquina flux formula and mc reconstruction .",
    "one of the main differences with respect to the spherical test case of the previous section is that the equations that we are solving have sources due to the gravity terms . in general the presence of non - zero sources",
    "can increase the stiffness of the problem leading to inaccurate solutions , even unstable for extremely stiff sources .",
    "we expect some influence of the cfl factor in our simulations since the reduction of the time step tends to cure the stiffness problems .",
    "we have performed simulations with cfl factor @xmath80 ( standard for all previous simulations ) , @xmath78 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , with a metric computation rate of @xmath113 , which maintain constant the metric computation rate per unit evolution time .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation at the end of the simulation varies about @xmath114 at most .",
    "however most of the variation is observed between cfl factor @xmath80 and @xmath78 , and decreasing the cfl factor further does not significantly changes the solution .",
    "therefore the effect on the computed damping rate can be neglected .",
    "we find that the stiffness of the sources depends on how often the metric is computed .",
    "we also perform the same simulations with a metric computation rate @xmath115 . in this case",
    "the metric is computed more often per time unit than the previous one , as the cfl factor decreases .",
    "we find variations of about @xmath116 in the final amplitude depending on the cfl factor used , although these variations depend strongly on the radial resolution .",
    "for @xmath117 the maximum variation due to cfl factor changes is smaller than @xmath118 .",
    "since the effect of the cfl factor becomes larger lowering the metric computation rate , we can conclude that the sources become more stiff if the metric is computed more often .",
    "an explanation for this effect is that if the metric is computed less often , the sources vary due to the space - time evolution on time - scales longer , than the hydrodynamic variables , which reduces the stiffness .",
    "we conclude that the stiffness of the sources is not significantly affecting the computation of the damping rates for the metric computation rate that we use in our regular simulations .",
    "however special care should be taken in simulations in which the metric computation rate is high ( close to one ) , e.g. in black hole formation simulations , since the stiffness of the sources could lead to an increasing of the numerical viscosity of the code if the cfl factor is not appropriately lowered .",
    "we also perform 2d - axisymmetric simulations with @xmath119 , @xmath120 @xmath84 and @xmath85 angular grid points . since the initial perturbation is radial , non - radial modes are not excited .",
    "we find an error in the angular velocity which is of order @xmath121 , and which is closely related to the accuracy of numerical recovery of the primitive variables .",
    "since the angular extension of the grid restricts the time step of the simulation in a factor proportional to @xmath122 , we find a similar behaviour increasing @xmath123 as it is found decreasing the cfl factor .",
    "we conclude that it is possible to estimate dissipation effects in numerical simulations which produce an effect similar to physical bulk viscosity . in a very simplified case , as the test fluid sphere of constant density , the numerical viscosity scales with the order of the reconstruction . in the application of our method to neutron stars simulations",
    "we find that the behaviour of the numerical viscosity is more complicated since the gravity sources also contribute to the numerical dissipation processes , and the presence of the surface lowers the scaling of the viscosity to first order .    to understand why the numerical inaccuracies can be modelled as a bulk viscosity term we consider the generic form of the flux formula in a riemann solver @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the numerical flux that is used in the time update",
    ", @xmath126 is an averaged value of the flux , @xmath127 represents the discontinuity at each cell interface and @xmath128 the eigenvalue matrix .",
    "the particular form of the average and the matrix @xmath129 depends on the particular riemann solver .",
    "if a reconstruction scheme of order @xmath74 is used , the value of @xmath129 at both sides of the interface in smooth regions of the flow agrees up to the @xmath130-th derivative , therefore for any function @xmath131 @xmath132 where @xmath133 represents @xmath74-th spatial derivatives . if one applies this expression to the momentum equation @xmath134 where @xmath135 depends on the specific riemann solver used and @xmath136 represent the sources ( r.h.s of ) .",
    "the new term appearing in the numerical version of the equations is a dissipative term since in includes a @xmath137 derivative , while @xmath138 is the corresponding dissipative coefficient . for first order reconstruction ,",
    "the dissipation term includes second derivatives that resemble to a viscosity term with viscosity proportional to @xmath139 . for higher order reconstruction",
    "the new term resembles hyperviscosity coefficients .",
    "note that with this interpretation we can identify the computed value of @xmath20 in our simulations with a viscosity or hyperviscosity term , which scales with resolution with the order of the reconstruction scheme .",
    "furthermore , we can argue that , since the new terms in are responsible for both the bulk viscosity and shear viscosity terms , the value of the numerical shear viscosity of the code has to be of the same order of magnitude as the numerical bulk viscosity estimated in this work . if this case were true , the method described in this paper could be a powerful tool to estimate numerical dissipative effects in multidimensional simulations",
    ". however the method has some limitations due to the approximations that we considered .",
    "the integral expressions and as well as the approximate expression for the expansion rely on the facts that a post - newtonian expansion is possible and that velocity perturbations are small .",
    "this provides an order - of - magnitude estimate in the case of systems involving neutron stars or proto - neutron stars since @xmath140 . in this scenarios",
    "the velocity involved in oscillations is typically smaller than @xmath78 . in the vicinity of black holes ,",
    "the post - newtonian expansion is not convergent anymore , and the method can lead to large inaccuracies .",
    "similar thing happens in the case of flows with a high lorentz factor as those observed in jets .    from our simulations",
    "we also conclude that the gravity can be an important source of numerical viscosity which has to be estimated in an appropriate way .",
    "the stiffening of the sources in the presence of rapidly changing spacetime , can lead to a strong increasing in the numerical viscosity if the cfl condition is not adapted accordingly .",
    "although this effect is not a problem in the simulations presented in this work , it could be in case in which the spacetime evolves in similar time - scales as the fluid , e.g. in the formation of a black hole .",
    "it is therefore important to test in the future which are the real effects of numerical viscosity in such simulations .",
    "finally , we note that all the viscosity results given in this paper are normalized to @xmath141 , which depends on the frequency of the oscillation @xmath142 . for a given astrophysical scenario , and the same numerical resolution ,",
    "different modes will be affected in a different way depending on the frequency of the mode .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate the resolution needed to evolve a system for a given amount of time with reasonably small damping one has to use the mode with higher frequency , of those who may be important in the dynamics of the system .",
    "deciding which is this mode may be non trivial in non - linear simulations , since a strong numerical damping in high frequency modes , which are coupled to the lower frequency modes , can modify the damping times for the low frequency modes too .",
    "this work was supported by the collaborative research center on gravitational wave astronomy of the deutsche forschungsgesellschaft ( dfg sfb / transregio 7 ) .",
