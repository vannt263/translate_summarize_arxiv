    "in hadron - structure theory one is interested in describing the hadron as a relativistic composite system . to date , most basic properties of hadrons can not yet be derived from qcd  the fundamental theory of the strong interactions .",
    "note , however , that qcd sum rules can place some constraints regarding quark - distribution amplitudes in mesons and baryons  @xcite . with the advent of more powerful computing facilities ,",
    "lattice gauge theory  @xcite should provide an increasingly useful means of studying hadronic physics . yet , at the present time it does not provide a convenient framework for a systematic study of a large variety of hadronic phenomena . specifically , with the commission of state - of - the - art facilities , such as cebaf , other nonperturbative techniques will be required which can be used to incorporate phenomena at many different length scales within a single theoretical framework .    to a large extent our current understanding of hadronic structure is based on the nonrelativistic constituent quark model  @xcite .",
    "meson properties are well reproduced by a phenomenological potential consisting of the sum of a short - range one - gluon exchange ( oge ) component and a long - range confining contribution . a quantitative description of meson masses , their static properties and decay rates count among the many successes of the model .",
    "generally , one would prefer to have a relativistic and manifestly covariant model .",
    "for example , a covariant formalism will enable one to relate the wave function ( or vertex function ) in different frames .",
    "this becomes essential for calculating hadronic form factors at finite momentum transfer .",
    "the starting point for most relativistic studies of the meson spectrum is the covariant bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation can be regarded as the relativistic generalization of the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "however , the bethe - salpeter equation , being covariant , depends on the zeroth component of the relative four - momentum ( i.e. , the relative energy ) . aside from the technical difficulties encountered in handling this extra degree of freedom",
    ", one must decide in the present case how to generalize the essentially nonrelativistic quark - antiquark potential to four dimensions  a nontrivial task to carry out correctly .",
    "the difficulty in dealing with the relative energy has led to many different approximations to the bethe - salpeter equation wherein one works within a three - dimensional reduction but attempts to retain fundamental physical principles . there is no obviously correct method .",
    "thus , one should study different three - dimensional reductions in the hope of isolating model - independent results . here",
    "we work within the instantaneous bethe - salpeter framework ( salpeter s framework ) .",
    "although retardation effects and manifest covariance are lost , one retains relativistic kinematics , the relativistic character of the potential , and the dirac structure of positive- and negative - energy states .",
    "the use of the instantaneous approximation commonly employed in the literature entails other problems besides the loss of retardation and manifest covariance ; salpeter s bound - state equation is represented by a _",
    "nonhermitian _ hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , it has been recognized  @xcite that salpeter s equation is identical in structure to a random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) equation familiar from the study of nuclear collective excitations  @xcite .",
    "thus , it can be rewritten as a hermitian eigenvalue equation  but for the square of the energy .",
    "this suggests the possibility of imaginary eigenvalues which would signal the onset of an instability . for our problem of interest these imaginary solutions",
    "are unphysical and their appearance can be precluded by limiting the form of the kernel .",
    "this is achieved through a stability analysis of salpeter s equation .",
    "we should stress that any study based on salpeter s equation is not complete until the stability analysis is performed .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present the stability analysis and to examine the implications for the meson spectra .",

    "is constrained .",

    "an explicit calculation gives for the expectation value of the confining potential ( with @xmath110 ) @xmath138 thus , there is no @xmath139 contribution to the expectation value of @xmath140 coming from the confining potential ; only a positive contribution , @xmath141 , remains at @xmath142 .",
    "note that , because of the additional dimensionful parameter @xmath143 , the contribution from the confining potential , unlike the coulomb contribution , depends on the value of the constituent mass .",
    "hence , for a coulomb potential of the form of eq .",

    "the heavy quarkonia ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) and the light quarkonia ( @xmath147 and @xmath148 ) are investigated in the instantaneous bethe - salpeter framework .",
    "the analysis is intended to be qualitative in nature , with regard to various effects stemming from the instantaneous approximation ; hence a simple generalization of the cornell potential  @xcite is employed .",
    "the virtue of this approach is its simplicity .",
    "the few parameters of the model , constrained by the stability analysis , will emerge from the `` best '' fit to the meson spectra .",
    "one wishes to reproduce the interesting physics ( e.g.  hyperfine structure ) through relativistic effects , rather than by a fine tuning of many parameters .    for the heavy quarkonia",
    ", the mass spectra are reasonably described , but details such as the fine and hyperfine structure are less so . for the light quarkonia , the mass spectra",
    "are less reasonably described : the pion can not be accurately modelled within this framework without losing the remaining spectra . at the very least",
    ", a more sophisticated phenomenology will be required to accurately describe static properties of the heavy and light quarkonia .    for the remainder of the section ,",
    "the following program is carried out : the various models to be considered within the salpeter framework are defined . then , phenomenological fits to the experimental spectra for heavy mesons are carried out , and a quantitative analysis of the various approximations in the salpeter framework and their effect on the spectra and splittings is performed .",
    "the latter half of the section is concerned with the light mesons .",
    "the spatial part of the potential is based on the cornell potential ; that is , confinement is parameterized by a linear potential plus a constant , and the asymptotically - free regime is parameterized by an instantaneous oge potential . since a good description of the mass spectra of the heavy quarkonia",
    "can be obtained with a linear confining potential plus the nonrelativistic reduction of the oge piece , this is a natural first choice for the salpeter equation .",
    "( one can , of course , generalize the oge piece to include running coupling effects motivated from perturbative qcd . )    a mixture of scalar and timelike lorentz structures for the confining kernel is considered , as a number of authors  @xcite have suggested that an admixture of scalar and timelike confinement is necessary to reproduce the experimental spectra and splittings .",
    "the full vector structure is not incorporated in the confining kernel , as this leads to an instability similar to the scalar case .",
    "the full vector structure in the feynman gauge is used for the oge kernel .",

    "one should note that the breit ( @xmath153 ) model has no such restrictions in principle , saving the possibility of the spectrum becoming unbound from below if the strong coupling becomes too large , similar to the problem encountered for the relativistic coulomb problem of section  [ secstability ] .",
    "however , for comparative purposes , @xmath150 is restricted to the same range in both models .",
    "one solves for eigenenergies of the breit ( no coupling between positive and negative energy states ) and full salpeter equations , expanding the salpeter partial - wave amplitudes in an oscillator basis of 20 states per partial wave ( , or up to 19 nodes in the amplitudes ) to insure adequate convergence of the solutions , and with an oscillator parameter value suitable for the heavy mesons .",
    "initially , there are six free parameters in the model : @xmath143 , @xmath82 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 . the same @xmath143 , @xmath150 , and @xmath82",
    "are used to fit both charm and beauty .",
    "@xmath151 is set to zero , assuming the long - range part of the kernel to be less important for the heavy mesons .",
    "the scalar - timelike mixing parameter @xmath150 will be allowed to take only the values 0.5 and 1.0 , corresponding to equally - mixed scalar and timelike structure and pure timelike structure , respectively . hence , the model for the heavy mesons will only have four free parameters , which are determined through minimization of the @xmath156 function @xmath157 using a nonlinear optimization routine  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath158 and @xmath159 are the experimental masses and associated errors chosen for the fit , here the first two observed @xmath160 states of b - quarkonium , the first two observed @xmath161 states and the first five observed @xmath160 states of charmonium . these states are used to determine a set of parameters for each choice of lorentz structure of the confinement .",
    "then , one observes how each of the corresponding spectra agrees with the experimental data overall .",
    "the @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the calculated masses and their errors within the model ( which were taken to be 5 - 10 mev ) .",
    "the incorporation of a theoretical error allows one , in principle , to `` force '' a better fit to some states , at the risk of possibly degrading the fit with respect to the rest of the spectra ; however , all states were weighted equally in this regard .",
    "the minimization results for the four parameters for the four models ( see table  [ table1achap4 ] for the appropriate definitions ) are summarized in table  [ table1chap4 ] , while the charm and beauty quarkonia spectra calculated for each model are summarized in table  [ table2chap4 ] and table  [ table3chap4 ] .",
    "the experimental masses were taken from the review of particle properties  @xcite ( with the exception of the @xmath164 , which was taken from reference  @xcite ) .",

    "the numbers quoted for the higher - lying states in table  [ table2chap4 ] and table  [ table3chap4 ] should be noted with caution , as typically a 10 - 20 mev shift in the energies for the fourth - to - fifth eigenstates in going from 18 to 20 basis states is encountered . in particular , the larger differences in the table with respect to the experimental data for the higher excited states are indicative of an insufficient number of states in the basis . also , all the models appear to be somewhat deficient in comparison to results given by long  @xcite and spence and vary  @xcite , which examine both breit and salpeter equations for a scalar confining kernel and a vector coulomb kernel . however , those studies allowed more freedom in determining the salpeter solutions .",
    "long utilizes an oscillator basis but minimizes each eigenstate separately ; each state has a different value of @xmath167 characterizing it , rather than one value for all states . while this procedure does minimize the eigenenergies with fewer states in the basis , the disadvantage is that the eigenstates are not orthogonal , which would be a problem in the calculation of matrix elements , and in ensuring the proper normalization of bound states .",
    "spence and vary use a spline basis  @xcite as well as an additional interaction ( a so - called `` breit '' interaction ) which makes comparison more difficult .",
    "however , in their work , solutions with imaginary roots ( for the light mesons in particular ) were discarded on the claim that the imaginary roots appear far from the real roots of interest in the complex plane when the spline basis is chosen as in the study  @xcite  a procedure that yields ( apparently ) stable solutions of the salpeter equation for scalar confinement , in contrast to the results presented here . this latter approach differs drastically from the viewpoint adopted in this work , which is that the onset of imaginary solutions should indicate that a particular interaction is physically inappropriate within the model .",
    "( it is rather amusing to note that , when examining a kernel that can lead to instabilities , one can `` tune '' the oscillator basis to get apparently stable solutions , but that either shifting the value of @xmath167 or increasing the number of states in the basis ( or both ) reveals the instability . )",
    "table  [ table4chap4 ] lists the first four eigenenergies for the pseudoscalar and vector channels , using the salpeter - mixed parameters from table  [ table1chap4 ] , to illustrate the various relativistic effects in salpeter s equation .",
    "( these are also illustrated in figure  [ fig10chap4 ] . )",
    "the results show a consistent decrease in the energy of a given level as more relativistic effects are included in the calculation . in going from the schrdinger case ( nonrelativistic kinematics ) to the spinless salpeter case ( relativistic kinematics ) , the energy decreases simply because the nonrelativistic kinetic energy increases quadratically for large momenta , while the relativistic case only increases linearly ; since the potential is the same for both cases , the states are more `` bound '' in the relativistic case . for the breit case with no lower components ,",
    "the relativistic normalization ( @xmath168 ) of the free dirac spinors suppresses the overall potential for large momenta with respect to the nonrelativistic case , as the normalization varies from 1 in the extreme nonrelativistic limit to @xmath169 in the extreme relativistic limit .",
    "however , both attractive and repulsive contributions to the potential are suppressed , and the energy is still decreased relative to the nonrelativistic case .",
    "the inclusion of z - graphs in the salpeter case always leads to an added attraction , and consequently to energies reduced relative to the breit case .    with the introduction of the lower components ,",
    "the energies are decreased still further , for both the breit and salpeter cases .",
    "in particular , the spacelike part of the vector potential ( @xmath66 ) makes a large contribution . the decrease in going from breit to salpeter",
    "is realized from the fact that the spacelike part connects the large component of a particle spinor to the large component of an antiparticle spinor in @xmath65 , hence the contribution from the z - graphs is much larger than that of the direct graphs alone .",

    "additional complications arise from the fact that in salpeter s equation  and in general , any two - body quasi - potential equation  a constant term in the confining kernel does not solely yield an additive shift in the meson mass spectrum but provides a dynamical contribution as well , unlike the schrdinger or spinless salpeter cases , where one can view it as a `` negative mass '' added to the hamiltonian .",
