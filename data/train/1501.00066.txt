    "very rich polarization features have been uncovered for both linear and circular polarizations , e.g. , ` s'-shaped position angle curves , orthogonal polarization modes , single sign and sign reversals of circular polarization , and their evolutions with frequency , etc .",
    "linear polarization of average pulse profiles is predominant for most pulsars at low frequencies .",
    "the polarization percentage generally decreases with the increase of observing frequency @xcite .",
    "@xcite noticed that some pulsars exhibit a critical frequency , below which the fractional linear polarization is constant , but above which it decreases with increasing frequency . to investigate the change of pulsar polarizations across a much wider frequency range ,",
    "@xcite extended polarization observations to mm - wavelengths , and noticed significant depolarization at high frequencies .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out that simple profiles are more likely to be characterized by high linear polarization than complex profiles , and polarization properties for different profile components of a given pulsar behave differently with frequency , e.g. , psr j0922 + 0638 .",
    "in addition to analysis of polarization features for individual pulsars , statistical investigations were also undertaken for pulsar linear polarization .",
    "it has been noticed at early days that short period pulsars tend to have high linear polarization @xcite .",
    "long period pulsars exhibit faster depolarization over frequency than the short period ones @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented the anti - correlation between the depolarization index and the acceleration potential near neutron star surface .",
    "several authors also demonstrated that the degree of linear polarization is higher for a pulsar with a large spin - down luminosity @xmath0 @xcite .    to understand various polarization features , numerous theoretical researches on pulsar polarization",
    "have been developed on the emission processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or the propagation effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , both of which can lead to depolarization .",
    "the depolarization of pulsar linear polarization is generally attributed to simultaneous interaction of two modes of orthogonally polarized radiation @xcite or owing to randomization of position angles in weaker magnetic fields in outer magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite attributed the depolarization to birefringence of the x mode and o mode above pulsar polar caps .",
    "@xcite qualitatively explained depolarization at high frequencies by considering the evolution of one natural plasma mode within pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "however , the formation and distribution of the two modes within a pulsar beam were not mentioned ; the refraction effect was simply discussed by analogy with the calcite crystal ; the polarization limiting effect was simply analysed ; and the evolution of linear polarization across field line planes was not investigated . to get a better understanding of the frequency dependence of pulsar linear polarization , emission processes together with propagation effects need to be investigated systematically .",
    "recently , we jointly studied the polarized curvature radiation together with propagation processes within pulsar magnetosphere numerically @xcite .",
    "we succeeded in demonstrating the distributions of the x - mode and o - mode within a pulsar magnetosphere and explained the depolarization across an entire pulsar beam .",

    "the larger curvature radius @xmath25 for particle trajectory in the high magnetosphere naturally leads to lower frequency emission .",
    "this is the physical basis for the radius to frequency mapping .",
    "for an inclined dipole magnetosphere , the pulsar emission beam is generally compressed in the meridional plane defined by the rotation axis and magnetic axis @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", our calculations assume that pulsar beams are circular , i.e. , the last open field lines which define the boundary of a pulsar beam have the same field line constant of @xmath26 , as defined by equation ( 15 ) of @xcite . in general , the beam size in the meridional direction does not affect our conclusions in this paper .",
    "the emission regions at three different frequencies of @xmath27 are calculated as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eheights ] .",
    "the height ranges are quasi symmetric about the magnetic axis for emission at a given frequency generated from the static dipole magnetosphere .",
    "emission near the beam centre comes from a lower altitude , as shown in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : eheights ] , because the curvature radii of the inner field lines at a lower altitude are comparable to those of the outer field lines at a higher altitude .",
    "further , the entire emission regions get deeper in the magnetosphere for a higher frequency , which is caused by the smaller curvature radii of field lines in the deeper magnetosphere .",
    "it should be noted that relativistic particles within a pulsar magnetosphere not only stream along the curved magnetic field lines , but also corotate with magnetosphere .",
    "when the corotation is considered , the trajectories and velocities of relativistic particles will be bent towards the rotation direction compared with those for the static dipole magnetosphere .",
    "hence , the emission regions become asymmetry , with heights for the leading part of the beam getting larger than those for the trailing part , as shown in the right panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : eheights ] .    for emission of a single particle bunch at a given height in the pulsar magnetosphere , the radiation field @xmath28 and the corresponding fourier components @xmath29 can be calculated by using the circular path approximation , as described by @xcite .",
    "the emission from a relativistic particle bunch is beamed in a @xmath30 cone around the velocity direction .",
    "therefore , the detectable emission from a given height and rotation phase is contributed by relativistic particles not only at the tangential emission point of a field line but also on nearby field lines within the @xmath30 cone . by integrating the emission within an entire emission cone from all field lines ,",
    "we will obtain the total polarized radiations in the given direction .",
    "in general , curvature radiation is highly linearly polarized , and the rotation has great influences on polarized curvature radiation process @xcite .",
    "once polarized emission is generated through the curvature radiation process , they will be coupled to local plasma modes to propagate out in a pulsar magnetosphere , which is filled with relativistic plasmas that can be simply assumed to be cold ( with a single lorentz factor @xmath24 ) and with a density of @xmath31 . here , @xmath32 is the multiplicity factor and @xmath33 represents the goldreich - julian density @xcite .",
    "two eigen transverse modes , the x - mode and o - mode , of the plasma have been carefully investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the x - mode waves have a refraction index of @xmath34 and propagate rectilinearly ; while the o - mode waves have a refraction index of @xmath35 and suffer refraction @xcite .",
    "the polarization states of the x - mode and o - mode change during their propagation . in the inner magnetosphere near the emission region , the polarization states of both modes evolve adiabatically , i.e. , with the polarization of the x - mode wave orthogonal to the local @xmath36 plane and the polarization of the o - mode wave within the @xmath36 plane @xcite . as the waves",
    "propagate to the higher magnetosphere , the adiabatic condition is not satisfied and wave - mode coupling happens , i.e. , one mode leaks to the other and vice versa .",
    "the altitude where the mode coupling happens is named as being the polarization limiting radius @xcite . above the polarization limiting radius , the polarization states of both modes are frozen and will not be further affected by the plasma , except for possible cyclotron absorption in the outer magnetosphere .         notes . @xmath37",
