    "they considered that a singularity of the mass @xmath485 outside of the edge is necessary , in order to uniquely specify the pseudospin .",
    "we have observed a similar situation for the deformation - induced gauge field for the edge , that is , the field is singular at the edge .",
    "it is also interesting to note that @xmath483 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deq ] ) corresponds to the mass of a dirac fermion , and that the armchair edge is a singular point as for the mass .    in summary , we have proposed a framework in which the edge is represented as the deformation - induced gauge field .",
    "we have used the framework to investigate the standing waves and edge states in the presence of a mass term and a magnetic field .",
    "the description of the edge using the deformation - induced gauge field is one attempt to better understand the edge .",

    "the configurations of the pseudospin field for three equivalent corners of the graphene bz are not the same , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pspin ] . consideration of this pseudospin behavior is given in this appendix .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian can be written as  @xcite @xmath486 where @xmath487 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "note that @xmath488 satisfies @xmath489 where @xmath215 and @xmath287 are integers .",

    "@xmath499 is a rotational matrix for the pseudospin around the @xmath205-axis , so that the pseudospin of @xmath496 and that of @xmath500 are related by rotation around the @xmath205-axis by an angle of @xmath501 .",
    "this explains why the configurations of the pseudospin field around the three equivalent k ( k@xmath6 ) points are different from each other , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pspin ] .",
    "next , we consider the effective hamiltonians for three equivalent k ( k@xmath6 ) points . by expanding @xmath488 around the wave vector of the k point , @xmath502",

    "it is then straightforward to obtain @xmath514 , and @xmath515 .",
    "this difference in the representations of the effective hamiltonians does not cause a problem , because a coordinate transformation can be used to eliminate the @xmath499 matrix from one effective hamiltonian ( see also appendices in ref .  ) .",
    "@xcite here , we imply the coordinate transformation as the rotation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1-axes by @xmath516 .",
    "a coordinate transformation can not alter the physics , and therefore the physical result derived from the effective hamiltonians are the same .",
    "rather , by using the change of the effective hamiltonians under a translation given by the reciprocal lattice vectors , a constraint for the form of the effective hamiltonians can be obtained .",
    "for example , the deformation hamiltonian , @xmath517 , should transform in the same way as @xmath518 .",
    "therefore , we must have @xmath519 , @xmath520 , and @xmath521 .",
    "otherwise , there would be three physically distinct effective hamiltonians for the same k point .",

    "therefore , the direction of the gauge field does not change , although the values of @xmath528 are renormalized for a strong deformation .",
    "the edge states in the presence of a mass term is of interesting , because the magnetism of the edge states is related to the generation of a local spin - dependent mass term due to the coulombic interaction .",
