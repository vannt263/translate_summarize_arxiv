    "in previous work @xcite ( paper  i ) , we calculated the quasi - local contribution to the self - force on a scalar particle in geodesic motion in a general spacetime .",
    "we now show how this can be extended to allow for the motion to be non - geodesic .",
    "a strong motivation for doing so is that it allows our results to be compared against existing work .",
    "anderson and hu @xcite have calculated the coordinate expansion of the function @xmath0 appearing in the hadamard form of the green s function , providing a convincing check on the validity of the relations between covariant and coordinate expansions given below .",
    "in fact , the comparison allowed a missing factor of 2 in the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to be discovered @xcite .",
    "anderson and wiseman @xcite built on this work to calculate the quasi - local contribution to the scalar self - force for the case of a particle held at rest in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this is useful not only as a check on the current work ( in particular , with @xmath1 , for eqs .",
    "( [ eq : staticresult ] ) ) but also allows us to correct their result .",
    "finally , wiseman @xcite has shown that the total self - force in this case of a static scalar particle in schwarzschild spacetime is zero .",
    "this could potentially facilitate a study of the usefulness and accuracy of the matched expansion approach @xcite to the calculation of the self - force .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : qlsf - eom ] , we extend the general equations of motion calculated in paper  i to allow for non - geodesic motion .",
    "we then show in sec .",
    "[ sec : stationary ] how these expressions simplify significantly if the space - time is assumed to be stationary , and that they simplify further under the assumption that the space - time is static . as examples ,",
    "the cases of a particle at rest in reissner - nordstrm and kerr - newman space - times are considered in secs .",
    "[ sec : rn ] and [ sec : kn ] , respectively .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm result is also used as a check on the existing results of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "throughout this paper , we use units in which @xmath2 and adopt the sign conventions of @xcite .",
    "we denote symmetrization of indices using brackets ( e.g. @xmath3 ) and exclude indices from symmetrization by surrounding them by vertical bars ( e.g. @xmath4 ) .",
    "roman letters are used for free indices and greek letters for indices summed over all space - time dimensions .",
    "the roman letters @xmath5 are used for indices over spatial dimensions only .",
    "in paper  i , we calculated an expression for the scalar self - force on a scalar charge @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 travelling on a curved background spacetime .",
    "however , this expression was only valid provided the particle s path was that of a geodesic of the background spacetime .",
    "fortunately , with some care , this result can be extended relatively easily to allow for non - geodesic particle motion .",
    "as the calculation is largely the same as for geodesic motion , we briefly review it here ( focusing mostly on the differences caused by the non - geodesicity of the motion ) and direct the reader to paper  i for more extensive coverage .",
    "we begin with our expression from paper  i ( and previously given without some terms in refs .  @xcite and @xcite ) for the self - force in terms of a sum of local and non - local parts : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the 4-velocity of the particle , @xmath10 is the 4-acceleration , @xmath11 is the derivative of the 4-acceleration with respect to proper time , @xmath12 is the retarded scalar green s function , @xmath13 is the field mass and @xmath14 is the coupling to the background scalar curvature .",
    "the first terms are all local to the particle s position and can be computed immediately without posing any real difficulty .",
    "our task is therefore to elucidate the non - local integral term . to this end",
    ", we will work with an expression for the self - force which just contains the non - local integral term , with the understanding that the local terms can easily be added back in later if necessary : @xmath15 note that in the specific cases considered in paper  i , we only had geodesic motion ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) in ricci - flat spacetimes ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and without field mass ( @xmath20 ) , so that the local terms were all identically zero . however , for non - geodesic motion , the 4-acceleration will always be non - zero so there will always be at least those terms to be added back in .",
    "as in paper  i , we will focus only on the the quasi - local contribution to this integral and leave the remaining portion to be computed by other means .",
    "the hadamard form for the retarded green s function is @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is analogous to the heaviside step - function ( i.e. @xmath23 when @xmath24 is in the causal past of @xmath25 , @xmath26 otherwise ) , @xmath27 is the standard dirac delta function , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are symmetric bi - scalars having the benefit that they are regular for @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the synge @xcite world function . using this form for the green s function , the expression for the quasi - local contribution to the scalar self - force simply becomes @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a _ matching point _ chosen so that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are within a convex normal neighborhood and so that the remainder of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f - nl ] ) may be evaluated by other means .",
    "we now expand @xmath0 in two different ways .",
    "first , we express it in the form of a covariant taylor series expansion , i.e. an expansion in increasing powers of the derivative of the synge world function , @xmath36 : @xmath37 where explicit expressions for the @xmath38 , up to @xmath39 are given in paper  i for massless fields in vacuum spacetimes .",
    "paper  i also describes how they may be obtained for massive fields in general spacetimes from the results ref .",
    "@xcite .    in paper",
    "i , we were able to use this expression for @xmath0 to compute the self - force for geodesic motion .",
    "unfortunately , things are less straightforward when non - geodesic motion is allowed for .",
    "the problem arises as a result of the presence of @xmath40 in this expression . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : non - geodesic ] ) , it encodes the proper time , @xmath41 , along a geodesic of the background space - time through @xmath42 . however , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qlsfint ] ) is along the world line of the particle . in the previous case of geodesic motion ,",
    "this was not a problem as in that case @xmath41 is a natural parameter along the world line . for non - geodesic motion , this is no longer the case . to proceed with the calculation using",
    "this expansion of @xmath0 would require us to first express the geodesic proper time @xmath41 in terms of the integration variable , i.e. the particle s proper time @xmath43 .",

    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qlsfint ] ) is along the particle world - line , while @xmath40 is along the time - like geodesic.,width=226 ]    an easier resolution of this problem comes from expressing @xmath0 in a second form , as a non - covariant taylor series expansion in the coordinate separation of the points , @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and the quantities @xmath47 may be expressed in terms of combinations of the ( known ) quantities @xmath48 as follows .",
    "first , the world function @xmath49 may be expressed in terms of an expansion in powers of the coordinate separation of @xmath25 and @xmath24 , @xmath50 : @xmath51 where the coefficients @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ,  are to be determined . in order to determine these coefficients , we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - coord ] ) implies the coordinate expansion of the derivative of @xmath55 is : @xmath56 substituting expansions ( [ eq : sigma - coord ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmaderiv - coord ] ) into the defining relationship @xmath57 and equating powers of @xmath50 , we get expressions for each coefficient in terms of the lower order coefficients .",
    "the lowest terms are given by :    @xmath58    this procedure may be easily extended to higher orders using a computer algebra package .",
    "next , we obtain a relation between the known coefficients of the covariant expansion , eq .",

    "although @xmath62 could alternatively be given in terms of the @xmath59 , we have found that the expression we give proves easier to work with .",
    "it is found by taking five symmetrized partial derivatives of the equation @xmath63 and then taking taking the coincidence limit @xmath30 .",
    "it is a special case of the general result that follows from taking any number of symmetrized partial derivatives : @xmath64 applying this identity recursively , we can re - express this with all odd lower order coefficients eliminated : @xmath65 where the @xmath66 are the bernoulli numbers @xcite .",
    "thus , these identities determine all odd coefficients in terms of derivatives of lower order even coefficients .",
    "now , we simply substitute expansion ( [ eq : vc ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : qlsfint ] ) and , since @xmath0 is a scalar , take a partial rather than covariant derivative to get an easily evaluated expression for the self - force ( in this case , it is most natural to work with an expression for the self - force in covariant rather than contravariant form ) : @xmath67 d\\tau ' \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , we obtain the equations of motion by projecting orthogonal and perpendicular to the particle 4-velocity : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the projection orthogonal to @xmath70 .",
    "this expression may be evaluated for a specific particle path in a specific spacetime by writing the coordinate separations @xmath50 in terms of the particle proper time separation @xmath71 .",
    "specific examples of such an evaluation are given in the following sections .",
    "the expression for the quasi - local contribution to the self - force given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dxexpandedintegral ] ) and the subsequent equations of motion take on a significantly simple form if the space - time is assumed to be stationary and if we assume the spatial coordinate of the particle to be fixed .",
    "stationarity allows us to introduce coordinates @xmath72 such that the metric tensor components , @xmath73 are all independent of the time coordinate .",
    "in addition , for a particle  at rest \" , @xmath74 , and only the time component of the contravariant 4-velocity , @xmath75 , is non - zero .",
    "these conditions hold , of course , for the case of a particle held at rest in schwarzschild spacetime which has already received much attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "since the spatial coordinates of the particle are held fixed , the points @xmath25 and @xmath24 are now only separated in the time direction .",
    "furthermore , in this case it is straightforward to relate the time coordinate to the proper time along the particle s world line . as a result we can rewrite the coordinate separation of the points @xmath25 and @xmath24 in terms of the proper time : @xmath76 substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq : dxexpandedintegral ] ) and performing the straightforward integral of powers of @xmath77 gives @xmath78\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can now use eq .",
    "( [ eq : vhat5 ] ) for @xmath79 , along with the analogous equations for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath82 to eliminate several terms in this expression . while this did not previously prove particularly beneficial in the general case",
    ", the fact that partial derivatives with respect to @xmath83 of these fundamentally geometric objects vanish in a stationary spacetime means that many of the extra terms introduced by the substitution will also vanish . indeed it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vcompsym ] ) that ( in this case of purely time separated points ) any term of order @xmath84 can be related to the order @xmath85 term : @xmath86 as a result , eq .",
    "( [ eq : force - integrated ] ) may be taken to arbitrary order to give : @xmath87\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to proceed further , we benefit from differentiating between the time and spatial components : @xmath88\\\\ \\label{eq : force - integrated - covariant - spatial } f_{i}^{\\rm ql } & = & -q^2 \\big [      \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{(2k+1 ) ! } \\hat{v}_{\\underbrace{\\scriptstyle tt\\dots tt}_{2k } , i } \\delta \\tau^{2k+1 } ( u^t)^{2k }      + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{(2k ) ! }",
    "\\hat{v}_{\\underbrace{\\scriptstyle tt\\dots tt}_{2k-1 } i } \\delta \\tau^{2k } ( u^t)^{2k-1 }      \\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from this , it is clear that the @xmath83 component of the quasi - local self - force only appears at even orders in @xmath89 while the spatial components may appear at both even and odd orders .",
    "note , however , that for a static spacetime - i.e. imposing time reversal invariance in addition to stationarity - the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : force - integrated - covariant - spatial ] ) will vanish since each of the @xmath90 must be zero in that case ( as we have an odd number of @xmath83 s ) . as a result ,",
    "in a static space - time , the spatial component of the quasi - local self - force will only appear at odd orders in @xmath89 .    by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmdtau ] ) and the fact that only the time component of the contravariant 4-velocity is non - zero , we can now rewrite the rate of change of the particle s mass as :    @xmath91    similarly , by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ma ] ) we can now write the time and spatial components of the mass times 4-acceleration :    [ eq : ma - stationary - spacetime ] @xmath92    where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are as given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : force - integrated - covariant - time ] ) and ( [ eq : force - integrated - covariant - spatial ] ) .",
    "again , it is interesting to note the effect of imposing that the spacetime be static . for a static spacetime ,",
    "the metric components odd in @xmath83 vanish , so our result simplifies to :    [ eq : ma - static - spacetime ] @xmath95",
    "we now look at a specific example , where we calculate the quasi - local contribution to the scalar self - force on a static particle ( i.e. held at rest ) in reissner - nordstrm spacetime .",
    "we chose this spacetime as while , through its spherical symmetry , it retains much of the simplicity of schwarzschild spacetime , it also illustrates better the difference non - geodesic motion makes .",
    "this is because its non - vanishing ricci tensor means that the self - force appears at lower order than was seen in paper  i , where we concentrated on vacuum spacetimes .",
    "we therefore have more orders in which to see the difference between using the covariant ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : vt ] ) ) and coordinate ( eq .  ( [ eq : vc ] ) ) expansions for @xmath0 .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm spacetime has line element @xmath96    since this is an example of a particle at rest in a static spacetime , we may use eqs .",

    "this reduces to the schwarzschild case , which may be compared to ref .",
    "however , anderson and wiseman use an incorrect expression to relate @xmath101 to @xmath102 and also use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite prior to the corrections given in the subsequent errata @xcite .",

    "this is not very suprising as the benefit of using a covariant expansion hinges on having a geodesic along which to expand . the coordinate expansion , on the other hand , more naturally characterises motion which is not along a geodesic .",

    "sec : kn ] demonstrates , beginning with the covariant expansion and computing the coordinate expansion from it allows the calculation to be done for space - times which previous methods have not yet been able to do .",
    "it is also interesting to look more closely at the presence of the christoffel symbols in the relation between the covariant and coordinate expansions . in the present context ,",
    "these take on a particularly clear form by being directly related to the 4-acceleration of the particle . in particular , the leading order at which this effect appears is given in eq .",
