    "the large hadron electron collider ( lhec ) is the second electron - hadron collider following hera @xcite . with remarkable higher energy and luminosity",
    ", the lhec is a major step towards understanding the higgs physics and qcd . for the lhec colliding energy , the 7 tev proton beam at the lhc as well as the 50 tev proton beam at the future fcc - he @xcite and a new 60 gev",
    "electron beam @xcite are envisaged . to probe new physics , the anomalous flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) yukawa interactions , between the top - higgs and either an up or charm quark ,",
    "would provide a clear signal .",
    "the sm lagrangian can be extended by the following terms,@xmath8 where the real parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the fcnc couplings of the higgs to up - type quarks .",
    "the total decay width of the top - quark @xmath11 is @xmath12 where the decay width @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "thus , the branching ratio for @xmath15 can be approximately given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fermi constant and @xmath18 .",
    "the w boson and top quark masses are chosen to be @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "up to now , the investigation of @xmath21 anomalous couplings have been experimented by many groups , which gives the stronge limits on the top - higgs fcnc couplings .",
    "for instance , according to the atlas and cms collaborations , the upper limits of br @xmath22 @xmath5 @xcite and br @xmath23 @xmath5 @xcite have been set at 95 @xmath5 confidence level ( c.l . ) . except for the direct collider measurements , the low energy observable , by bounding the tqh vertex from the observed @xmath24 mixing @xcite ,",
    "the upper limit of br @xmath25 may be produced .",
    "furthermore , through @xmath26 decay and electroweak observables , the upper limit of br @xmath27 @xmath5 @xcite can be obtained .    on the other hand , based on the experimental data ,",
    "many phenomenological studies are performed from different channels .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that the branching ratios br @xmath28 can be probed to 0.24 @xmath5 at 3@xmath7 level at 14 tev lhc with an integrated luminosity of 3000 @xmath29 through the process @xmath30 .",

    "and @xcite obtained the br @xmath28 to be 0.112 @xmath5 based on the process of @xmath32 .",
    "the process of @xmath33 has been studied in @xcite and they estimated the upper limits of br @xmath34 @xmath5 at 100 @xmath29 of 13 tev data for multilepton searches . the results from different experiments and theoretical channels are summarized in table [ sbaftercuts_1 ] .",

    "in this paper , we investigated the anomalous fcnc yukawa interactions between the top quark , the higgs boson , and either an up or charm quark with a channel @xmath0 at the lhec .",
    "the signal significance @xmath35 can be obtained as 4.191 ( 4.921 ) , 6.652 ( 7.874 ) , 15.341 ( 16.934 ) and 19.238 ( 20.785 ) with the cut - based ( mva - based ) method at ( @xmath6 , @xmath1 ) = ( 7 tev , 60 gev ) , ( @xmath6 , @xmath1 ) = ( 7 tev , 120 gev ) , ( @xmath6 , @xmath1 ) = ( 50 tev , 60 gev ) and ( @xmath6 , @xmath1 ) = ( 50 tev , 120 gev ) .",
    "similarly , our results show that the branching ratio @xmath36 @xmath37 can be probed to 0.113 ( 0.093 ) @xmath5 , 0.071 ( 0.057 ) @xmath5 , 0.030 ( 0.022 ) @xmath5 and 0.024 ( 0.019 ) @xmath5 , and with the e - beam polarization @xmath38 , the expected limits can be greatly reduced .",
    "finally , a detailed comparison between our study and the critical limits obtained by the experiments and other phenomenological studies are shown .",
