    "note that the formal standard deviations are poor indicators , given the small numbers involved and non - gaussian distribution . from the table ,",
    "the line luminosities of wn stars in the smc are apparently a factor of 23 times lower than their lmc and galactic counterparts . however , line luminosities of smc wne stars do not do not fall systematically below galactic or lmc wne stars with comparable ( low ) absolute magnitudes as shown in fig .",
    "similarly , sk41 has a luminosity that is within @xmath120% of mean galactic and lmc values , if the remarkable wn56 stars in lmc and galactic giant hii regions are excluded ( e.g. crowther & dessart 1998 ) .",
    "hd5980 is omitted from the smc sample shown in table  [ table3 ] , since its line luminosity is from multiple components , highly variable and indeed of uncertain origin .",
    "the heii @xmath94686 luminosity of hd5980 was 5.59@xmath610@xmath54 ergs@xmath4 in 1981 , prior to outburst , when its spectral type was wn34 .",
    "observations obtained in dec 1994 , shortly after outburst , when the spectral type was wn8 , revealed an even more remarkable heii line luminosity of 2.26@xmath610@xmath55 ergs@xmath4 , which is a factor of four greater than any other wn system from our sample , albeit with an equally impressive absolute visual magnitude ( table  [ table1 ] ) .    amongst wc / wo stars , comparisons between the smc and other galaxies are hindered by the absence of wc stars in the smc . amongst the wo stars with known distances , sand  5 ( wr142 , wo2 ) in the galaxy , sand  2 ( bat99 - 123 , wo3 ) in the lmc , and sand  1 ( ab8 , wo3+o ) in the smc , it is sand  1 which has the largest civ @xmath95801 luminosity .",
    "however , attempts to draw conclusions are severely hindered by the very low numbers involved .",
    "to illustrate this , dr1 ( wo3 ) in the smc - like ic1613 has a civ line luminosity which is a factor of three times lower than sand  1 ( kingsburgh & barlow 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , wo and wn stars in the smc do not have systematically lower line luminosities than their higher metallicity counterparts .",
    "therefore , mean values of our entire sample may be determined , and are indicated in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "how do mean line luminosities compare with previous determinations ?",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1990a ) obtained 3.3@xmath610@xmath54 erg s@xmath4 from observations of 5 lmc wc4 stars , which is confirmed here , based on a much larger sample of 25 galactic and lmc wce stars .",
    "more recently , schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) obtained ( 5.2@xmath562.7)@xmath610@xmath57 erg s@xmath4 from 26 wne stars and ( 1.6@xmath561.5)@xmath610@xmath54 erg s@xmath4 from 19 wnl stars . from 59 wne stars , a 20% higher mean results here , while 43 wnl stars indicate a 30% lower calibration for late wn stars .",
    "note that application of these mean luminosities will lead to an overestimate of the true wn population in starburst regions by a factor of @xmath123 if luminous wn56h stars dominate the wr signature , as is the case in 30 dor and ngc3603 .",
    "conversely , if the properties of constituent wne stars are more typical of smc stars , where close binary evolution probably plays an important role , the actual population would be underestimated by a similar factor .",
    "if wr stars in the smc have slower winds than their galactic and lmc counterparts due to lower metallicity , we expect that their line widths will also be systematically lower",
    ".    however , in contrast to line fluxes , fwhm are sensitive to observational resolution .",
    "for example , ab7 has fwhm(heii @xmath9 4686)=32from low resolution spectroscopy of torres - dodgen & massey ( 1988 ) , in contrast to 26  from medium resolution aat / rgo data .",
    "this observational limitation also complicates the smith et al .",
    "classification scheme , which assigns ` b ' for broad lined stars if fwhm(heii @xmath5830   ( see also conti 1999 ) . consequently , we have measured fwhm(heii ) for a wr sample obtained with a uniform medium resolution of @xmath12 ) . where these are unavailable , corrections to measurements from torres - dodgen & massey ( 1988 ) datasets are made , using stars in common to both datasets as calibrators .    from table",
    "[ table3 ] , we find that the mean fwhm(heii @xmath94686 ) for wne stars does decrease at lower metallicity , from 33  in the galaxy to 25  in the smc . however , since the smc wr population is so low , taking into consideration the dependence of fwhm on individual spectral types , no unambiguous conclusions may be drawn .",
    "for example , lmc wce stars reveal systematically higher fwhm ( civ @xmath9580112 ) than galactic stars since the lmc wc population is solely represented by wc4 stars , which are rare in our galaxy .",
    "the situation is further complicated in our galaxy since schild et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and armandroff & massey ( 1991 ) identified a correlation between fwhm(civ @xmath9580112 ) and galacto - centric distance for wce stars in our galaxy and m33 , attributed to a metallicity gradient . amongst wo stars , we find an apparent trend towards narrower lines at lower metallicity , again based on a very small sample .",
    "contrary to expectations , it appears that both the stellar properties and line luminosities of wolf - rayet stars in the smc do not differ significantly from their counterparts in higher metallicity galaxies .",
    "therefore , the reliability of studies of wr starburst galaxies at low metallicity based on template galactic or lmc stars is supported here .",
    "however , individual spectral types may differ by up to a factor of @xmath15 from mean wn , wc or wo line luminosity calibrations .",
    "therefore , the question of what wolf - rayet flavours are produced in different star forming regions becomes relevant .",
    "one added complication is that close binary evolution probably plays a major role in the formation of smc wr stars , which may affect their physical properties .",
    "this is probably not the case for regions undergoing powerful bursts of massive star formation .",
    "it would be very useful to compare stellar properties and line luminosities of individual wr stars in low metallicity starbursts with the present calibrations , for which ic10 represents an ideal candidate ( massey & armandroff 1995 ) .",
