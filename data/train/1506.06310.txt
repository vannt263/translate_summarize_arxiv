    "the distance between @xmath9 and @xmath10 should be measured by the minimum cost for transporting @xmath7 to @xmath11 and @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the above double transportation problem is considerably complicated by the fact that , while the total energy is conserved , some energy can be transferred from forward to backward moving waves , or viceversa .",

    "as a wave front crosses waves of the opposite family , its speed can change . as a consequence ,",
    "the distance between two corresponding fronts in @xmath14 and @xmath15 may quickly increase , making the optimal transportation plan more costly . to compensate for this effect",

    "these can be summarized as follows .    for an open dense set of initial data ( u(0 , ) ,  u_t(0 , ) )  =  ( u_0 , u_1 )   ( ^3()h^1 ( ) ) ( ^2()^2 ( ) ) the corresponding solution @xmath32 of ( [ 2 ] ) is piecewise smooth in the @xmath6-@xmath33 plane , with singularities occurring along a finite set of smooth curves .",
