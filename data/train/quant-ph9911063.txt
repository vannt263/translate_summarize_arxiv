    "entanglement describes a system composed of two or more particles , which exhibits the astonishing property that the results of measurements on one particle can not be specified independently of the parameters of the measurements on the other particles . as one of the most striking features of the quantum mechanics , entanglement is playing a more and more important role in the young field of quantum information@xmath0 .",
    "recently , there has been growing interest in disentanglement of quantum states .",
    "usually an ideal disentanglement process can be described as : transforming a state of two or more subsystems into an disentangled state ( generally a mixture of product states ) such that the reduced density matrices of the subsystems are unaffected , i.e. @xmath1 with    @xmath2    where the positive weights",
    "@xmath3 satisfy @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 refer to the density matrices of the subsystem 1 and 2 respectively .    in an extreme case of disentanglement ,",
    "both quantum entanglement and classical correlations are eliminated , i.e. , the final state becomes @xmath7    it was recently shown by terno @xmath8 that an arbitrary state can not be disentangled into a tensor product of its reduced density matrices ( i.e. to satisfy eqs ( [ r2 ] ) and ( [ r3 ] ) ) .",
    "otherwise , in the process to distinguish an quantum state secretly chosen from a certain set of two entangled states , the probability that the observer makes a wrong guess will be lower than helstrom s minimal error probability , which can not be allowed by quantum mechanics .",
    "subsequently , mor proved that an ideal universal disentangling machine to satisfy eqs ( [ r1 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) can not exist@xmath9 in other words , an arbitrary quantum entangled state can not be disentangled .",
    "similar to quantum no - cloning theorem@xmath10 this result also stems from the linearity of quantum mechanics . since ideal universal disentanglement processes can not be realized , a natural question is then what level of disentanglement can be reached by a universal disentangling machine ?",
    "does there exist an optimal universal disentangling machine",
    "? started from peres - horodecki s separability criterion@xmath11 s. bandyopadhyay et .",
    "al have constructed a type of universal disentangling machine by using local cloning operations@xmath12 afterwards , they discussed optimal universal disentangling machines for two - qubit system and obtained a result identical to the case of local cloning operations@xmath13 in the present paper , we shall study the essential limits to the universal processes of disentanglement under the condition of local operations .",
    "in addition , arising from a class of special local operations , the varies of correlation feature of the given composite system are also considered .    in section 2 , by analyzing the changes of horodecki s t matrix induced by local operations , a necessary condition for local universal disentangling machines is derived .",
    "furthermore , we prove that the necessary condition are also sufficient for this type of disentanglement processes .",
    "we find that bandyopadhyay s results are only two special cases to satisfy this threshold boundary .",
    "moreover , for a certain set of two - qubit pure entangled states on which one knows partial information , we put forward a necessary and sufficient condition realizing ideal disentanglement by manipulating only one part of states . in section 3 ,",
    "based on fully entangled fraction ( see ref @xcite ) , a concept called inseparability correlation is proposed and its properties under some local operations are studied . in the last section ,",
    "we give a brief argument on some aspects of disentanglement and entanglement measure .",
    "let @xmath14 be an entangled density matrix of two - qubit system ; and @xmath15 and @xmath16 be the reduced density matrices of the subsystem 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "then an universal isotropic disentanglement process is defined as :    @xmath17    together with    @xmath18    where the parameter @xmath19 called reduction factor , describes the shrinking of the ith reduced density matrix . to meet the requirements of universality in the disentanglement process , it is reasonable to require that the reduced density matrices isotropically shrink . due to the reduced density matrices of the entangled system are mixed states , in general , the fidelity @xmath20 between the reduced density matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 : @xmath23 can not remain a constant .",
    "fidelity is no longer a suitable standard to quantify of disentanglement .",
    "so , we use the reduction factors to define a quality factor of disentanglement : @xmath24 when q reaches its maximum , the corresponding universal disentanglement process is optimal .    for a two - qubit system , it is convenient to use the hilbert - schmidt space representation of the density matrices :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 acts on the hilbert space @xmath27 @xmath28 stands for the identity operator , @xmath29 are the standard pauli matrices , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are vectors in @xmath32 called bloch vectors with @xmath33 the coefficients @xmath34 form a real matrix which we shall denote by @xmath35 .",
    "each part of reduced density matrices is the following :    @xmath36    @xmath37    for any local general measurements , a particularly useful description is the so - called operator - sum representation@xcite :    @xmath38    @xmath39    the two sets of operators satisfy the completeness relations @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "for simplicity of expression , we use two completely positive and trace - preserving superoperators @xmath42 ( i=1 , 2 ) to characterize the above maps . in view of the requirements of eqs ( [ r4 ] ) and ( [ r5 ] ) , the map relations can be written as    @xmath43    @xmath44    due to the arbitrariness of the vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath45 @xmath46 ) , we can further deduce the map relations satisfied by the identity operator and the pauli operators : @xmath47    thus , after the joint action described by @xmath48 , the whole density matrix of the two - qubit system becomes    @xmath49      for a long time , it is a puzzling question to check if a quantum system is entangled or not .",
    "peres and horodecki et .",
    "al have studied this question@xmath50 horodecki et .",
    "al proved that peres s criterion is necessary and sufficient condition for separability of 2@xmath512 and 2@xmath513 systems .",
    "for a two - qubit system , the correlations between subsystems are embodied in the matrix @xmath52@xcite@xmath53    @xmath54    in accordance with eq.([r7 ] ) , we can always select pauli s operators in a suitable representation to diagonalize the matrix @xmath55 :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 stands for a real orthonormal matrix . in this representation the initial bloch vectors @xmath30 and @xmath58are changed into :    @xmath59    then , the matrix @xmath55 is connected with the vector@xmath60 horodecki et .",
    "al have already systematically analyzed the space of the characteristic vectors .",

    "( it is worthy to stress that the vector @xmath70 relevant to the matrix @xmath55 is not unique because different orthonormal matrices can be selected to diagonalize the matrix @xmath71 it is easy to prove that in general cases ( @xmath72 ) there are 24 characteristic vectors corresponding to its matrix @xmath55 . )",
    "generally , not all the matrices @xmath55 are positive . for simplicity of discussion , we introduce a positive matrix @xmath73    @xmath74    thus , the vector @xmath75 is mapped to the vector @xmath76 at the same time , horodecki s tetrahedron @xmath61 is mapped to the hexahedron @xmath77 with vertices @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 ( see fig .",
    "all the map relations are summarized in the following :    @xmath83      for a 2@xmath512 composite system , people pay more attention to the correlation between subsystems . c. h. bennett et .",
    "al defined  fully entangled fraction  of a density matrix @xmath84 @xcite , which can act as an index to characterize nonlocal correlation : @xmath85 where the maximum is over all completely entangled states @xmath86 .",
    "fully entangled fraction can be indicated as another from @xcite : @xmath87 where n(@xmath84)=trm(@xmath84 ) ( see ref @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "although , relying on different representations , a density matrix @xmath84 normally can correspond to different matrix m(@xmath84 ) , the trace of matrix m(@xmath84 ) is unique .    in fig 2 , for all separable quantum states , the characteristic vectors of their matrices m",
    "are contained in the tetrahedron @xmath88 , while , all the dots in the tetrahedron @xmath89 correspond to inseparable quantum states .",
    "we call @xmath88 and @xmath90 separability and inseparability correlation region respectively . here",
    ", it is worthy to note that not all the quantum states with characteristic vectors being located in @xmath88 are separable , but , as far as fully entangled fraction is concerned , these states can not be different from separable quantum states .",
    "@xmath91 is an arbitrary dot in inseparability correlation region @xmath90 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . line segment @xmath92 intersects plane @xmath93 at dot @xmath94 let us define the inseparability correlation coefficient @xmath95 of the dot @xmath91 :    @xmath96    we stipulate that inseparability correlation coefficients of all the dots in the region @xmath88 are zero .",
    "thereby , for any two - qubit density matrix @xmath97 its inseparability correlation coefficient has the following form :    @xmath98    at a geometric intuitive angle , inseparability correlation coefficient depicts the minimal distance from the characteristic vector of given two qubits system to separability correlation region . in the hexahedron @xmath99 all the dots in the identical plane perpendicular to the orientation @xmath100 have the same inseparability correlation coefficient .",
    "the maximum of @xmath95 is in the dot @xmath101 @xmath102 corresponding to four bell states .    by observing eq([r15 ] ) , we find local universal isotropic disentangling operations cause the matrix @xmath52 shrink by the ratio @xmath103 in view of inseparability correlation coefficient @xmath104 we can achieve the necessary condition realizing local universal isotropic disentangling operations :    @xmath105    in the following part , we will prove that the necessary condition is also sufficient for this type of disentangling operations .",
    "for an arbitrary pure entangled state @xmath106 , without loss of generality , it can be indicated as @xmath107 in a suitable representation . in this case",
    "we have : @xmath108 we can use the coefficients of group operators in hilbert schmidt space to represent the above density matrix : @xmath109 ( here , we leave out the coefficients equal to zero . )",
    "these coefficients satisfy the following relations : @xmath110 after a local universal isotropic disentangling operation to satisfy map relation ( [ r14 ] ) , the density matrix @xmath111 is changed into : @xmath112 we define matrix @xmath113 as the partial transposition of @xmath114 ( see ref @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath113 has the following form : @xmath115 based on peres - horodecki criterion , the necessary and sufficient condition satisfying @xmath114 is separable follows that none of the eigenvalue of @xmath116 is negative , i. e. : @xmath117[1-\\eta _ 1\\eta _ 2-\\left ( \\eta _ 1-\\eta _ 2\\right ) s]-4\\eta _ 1 ^ 2\\eta _ 2 ^ 2t^2\\geq 0 .",

    "\\label{a9}\\ ] ] when t reaches maximum ( @xmath119 ) , the threshold inequality for local universal isotropic disentanglement processes is obtained : @xmath120 in addition , we know all the separable states still keep separable after being performed local operations . hence , we complete the proof .",
    "s. bandyopadhyay et .",
    "al have studied the disentanglement processes by using local cloning operations @xcite .",
    "their main results can be summarized as that it is possible to disentangle any two - qubit entangled state either by applying local cloning on one of its qubits provided the reduction factor of the isotropic cloner is less than or equal to @xmath121 or by local cloning of the individual subsystems provided the reduction factor of the isotropic cloner used is less than or equal to @xmath122 obviously , the two kinds of cloning operations are only special cases to satisfy the threshold condition ( [ r23 ] ) for local universal isotropic disentangling operations .    at the first part of this section , we have defined the quality factor of disentanglement @xmath123 under local isotropic disentangling operations , based on the threshold inequality ( [ r23 ] ) , the maximal @xmath91 can be obtained : @xmath124 corresponding to the case @xmath125 @xmath126 .",
    "finally , let us consider the following question : if the local universal disentanglement processes satisfying the threshold limit ( [ r23 ] ) eliminate quantum entanglement of the given system , can they fully eliminate classical correlations between subsystems and make the density matrix of the whole system become the product of local density matrices ?",
    "the answer is negative unless @xmath127 it is shown in fig 2 that for any pure entangled state @xmath97 none of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath128 is zero ( see ref @xcite ) .",
    "hence , after the disentanglement process each eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath129 is only shrunk by the ratio @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) , while the determinant of @xmath129 is still nonzero .",
    "however , it is easy to prove that a necessary condition for arbitrary quantum state with the product form is that its matrix @xmath73 has zero determinant . as a result , when the factor @xmath130 is not equal to zero , local universal isotropic disentangling operations can not completely cut off classical correlations between subsystems .",
    "as we know , there are no universal ideal disentanglement processes .",
    "there appears another question .",
    "provided that some information about quantum states is obtained , can we perform ideal disentangling operations for these quantum states ? clearly , if we know all the information about an entangled state , it can be disentangled completely .",
    "suppose that alice has a biparticle system : @xmath132 she sends particle b to bob .",
    "if bob has known the wavefunction of the biparticle state and which particle is sent , he can prepare a pair of entangled particles identical to alice s : @xmath133 bob swaps particle b with particle b , and traces out the particles b and a. as a result , the state of the remaining particles is a product of mixed states .",
    "this is a trivial result .    in general , we do not know all the information on quantum states .",
    "assume that alice has a set of known two - qubit pure entangled states @xmath134 she randomly singles out quantum states from this set and transmits part b of these states . here",
    ", the reduced density matrices of different states satisfy the relation @xmath135 ( i @xmath136 j ) . provided that a particle b is captured by eavesdropper eve in its transmitting process",
    ", in what case eve can perform an ideal disentangling operation for this entangled state by only manipulating the particle b ? to solve this question , here",
    ", we introduce the following theorem :    theorem 1 : the state secretly chosen from the set of two - qubit pure entangled states @xmath137 can be perfectly disentangled by only manipulating the particle b if the reduced density matrices of the part b of all the states in this set commute with each other , i.e. @xmath138 = 0 $ ] ( i @xmath136 j ; i , j = 1 ..... n ) .    proof : if all the reduced density matrices @xmath139 commute with each other , their spectral decompositions have the form :    @xmath140    where @xmath141 is a set of orthonormal basis for the qubit system .",
    "one can use the particle b as the control bit and an additional qubit as the target to perform a cnot ( controlled not ) operation :    @xmath142    where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are orthonormal states . after taking the trace over the additional qubit",
    ", @xmath145 becomes a mixture of product states , while its reduced density matrices keep invariant , i. e. a perfect disentanglement process is fulfilled .    in the special cases that the eavesdropper only knows some information on the state set ,",
    "we get another theorem :    theorem 2 : for a set of two - qubit pure entangled states @xmath146 the reduced density matrices of the part b are assumed to have the form @xmath147 if one only knows the orthonormal basis of @xmath139 s spectral decompositions @xmath148 but",
    "not spectral coefficients @xmath149 he can perform an ideal deterministic disentangling operation for this set by only manipulating the particle @xmath150 if and only if @xmath151 = 0 $ ] ( i @xmath136 j ; i , j = 1 ..... n ) .",
    "proof : the sufficient condition can be easily obtained from the theorem 1 . our task remains to prove the converse .",
    "suppose that there are two density matrices @xmath139 and @xmath152 with @xmath151 \\neq 0.$ ] we introduce an additional system c in the state @xmath153 ( if the state of the system is mixed , without loss of generality , we can view it as a pure state in a larger space ) .",
    "then , a joint unitary evolution between the particle @xmath150 and the additional system is performed :    @xmath154    @xmath155    an ideal disentanglement process requires that the reduced density matrices of the original state remain unchanged , i.e. ,    @xmath156    @xmath157    @xmath158    @xmath159    let us set @xmath160 .",
    "then @xmath139 has the following form :    @xmath161    we can use a completely positive and trace - preserving superoperator@xmath162 to characterize the operation for particle @xmath150 :    @xmath163    @xmath164    where @xmath165 and @xmath166 satisfy @xmath167 and @xmath168 respectively .",
    "the @xmath169 and @xmath170 are real numbers satisfying @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "the superoperator @xmath162 maps the reduced density matrix @xmath139 to itself :    @xmath173    @xmath174 + \\left ( 1-\\lambda _ i\\right ) \\left [ \\frac 12\\left ( i+b_i% \\overrightarrow{\\sigma } _ { i2}\\right ) \\right ] .",
    "\\label{r32}\\ ] ]    so , we obtain the following relation    @xmath175    since @xmath176 is unknown , by comparing two sides of the above equation , we get further relations @xmath177    @xmath178    thus the joint unitary evolution must be    @xmath179    @xmath180    where @xmath181 and @xmath182 are two normalized states satisfying @xmath183 and @xmath184 respectively .",
    "after the joint unitary evolution , the inseparability correlation coefficient of the system ab is @xmath185 to meet the requirement of @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath182 must be orthonormal . as the final result , we find that @xmath181 and @xmath188 are two orthonormal states .",
    "thereby , the reduced density matrices of the additional system and the particle @xmath150 have the same form .",
    "in essence , a universal broadcasting process of the mixed states is fulfilled .",
    "this result is conflict with the result that noncommuting mixed states can not be broadcast@xcite .",
    "if one performs a projection measurement on the additional system , an uncontrolled change of the reduced density matrix of the particle a will lead to the failure of ideal disentanglement . while , any operation in quantum mechanics can be represented by a generalized unitary evolution , together with a measurement .",
    "hence , we complete the proof .",
    "in this section , we will embark on analyzing the properties of inseparability correlation coefficient under some local operations . for @xmath95 coefficient",
    "we have :    prop 1 : @xmath189 if @xmath84 is separable .",
    "when the given system is in pure state or bell mixed state @xmath186 can be used as necessary and sufficient criterion of separability .",
    "prop 2 : local unitary operations leave @xmath190 invariant , i.e. @xmath191 .    for prop 1 , we can refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "prop 2 is evident because local unitary transformations can not give rise to the change of three eigenvalues of the matrix m. however , we are more concerned with the properties of inseparability correlation coefficient under local general operations .",
    "does it have the properties similar to the entanglement measures ?    for a qubit system ,",
    "its density matrix has the following form :    @xmath192    a general operation maps @xmath84 to @xmath193 @xcite :    @xmath194    @xmath195    where @xmath196 is a constant vector in @xmath197 and b is a 3@xmath1983 real matrix .",
    "this is an affine map , mapping the bloch sphere into itself . under the action of the superoperator @xmath199 ,",
    "the identity and pauli operators have the following map relations :    @xmath200    for a 2@xmath512 system described by eq([r7 ] ) , we perform a general operation on the first subsystem . here",
    ", we only consider the case of @xmath201 , in which adopting the following trick will excuse us from complicated calculations .",
    "we can introduce an auxiliary bell mixed state @xmath202 corresponding to the state @xmath26 described by eq([r7 ] ) : @xmath203 with the limit of @xmath204 , we have : @xmath205 because inseparability correlation coefficient only depends on the matrices t we can study the varies of bell mixed state @xmath202 instead of the state @xmath26 .    with regard to bell mixed states ,",

    "while , an accepted fact is that entanglement can not increase under local operations and classical communications .",
    "therefore , n(@xmath84 ) can not increase . as far as the bell mixed states in separability correlation region are concerned , n(@xmath84 ) can not exceed one under local operations .",

    "we will go on with this problem in our future work .",
    "under local operations , to achieve general isotropic disentanglement , a threshold limit has been shown in section 2 .",
