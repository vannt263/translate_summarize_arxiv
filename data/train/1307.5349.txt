    "the question of whether nesting instabilities of the fermi surface ( fs ) can drive charge density wave ( cdw ) formation in real materials has been the topic of numerous experimental and theoretical investigations for many years.@xcite in cases of apparently well - nested fss , subsequent inspection of the real part of the generalized susceptibility , which is the relevant quantity in assessing instabilities in the electronic system , and its imaginary counterpart ( which is not ) can rule against fs nesting being the _ primary _ driving force.@xcite in concert with instabilities in the electronic system , lattice effects ( through the softening of phonon modes associated with the cdw ) must also be considered on an equal footing.@xcite    the analysis of the electronic susceptibility of a material is central in determining whether an electronic instability that may be due to fs nesting is capable of driving some associated ordering phenomena .",
    "typically , the @xmath1 landscape of the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility are compared , and a peak that survives in both parts is taken as evidence that fs nesting may play a role in emergent phenomena that occurs at that wavevector",
    ". however , the susceptibility function represents an integral over the brillouin zone ( bz ) , i.e.  over all @xmath2-states .",
    "consequently , one of the deficiencies of this approach is that some of the most important information that is available in the susceptibility is integrated out ; that is to say , _ which _ electrons actually contribute to the instability . in order to illustrate the importance of the @xmath2-dependence of the susceptibility ,",
    "we introduce it here on a prototypical system , 2_h_-tase@xmath0 , and demonstrate , from an experimental perspective , the additional insight that is available from this kind of analysis .    of the many cdw materials , the transition metal dichalchogenides are amongst",
    "the most well - known and well - studied.@xcite indeed , it is surprising that after the many experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigations , 2_h_-tase@xmath0 still courts controversy as to whether the fs is responsible for its cdw .",
    "below @xmath3  k , an incommensurate cdw transition with a wave vector @xmath4 develops , with @xmath5 , which experiences a lock - in to a commensurate structure ( @xmath6 ) below 90  k. @xcite the isoelectronic and isostructural compound 2_h_-nbse@xmath0 , also hosts a similar incommensurate cdw at @xmath7  k.@xcite experimentally , the topology of the fs of tase@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 are quantitatively different , @xcite which immediately raises difficulties with the conventional fs nesting model . in particular , state - of - the - art bandstructure results firmly rule out the fs nesting model,@xcite whereas some recent high - resolution angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) measurements contradict the theory , suggesting a primary role for the fs via its experimental autocorrelation map .",
    "@xcite    here , we address this controversy directly through complementary arpes measurements and _ ab initio _ bandstructure calculations . through careful band and * k*-resolved calculations of the experimental susceptibility , at energies near and far away from the fermi level ( @xmath8 ) ,",
    "we show that fs nesting is too weak to drive cdw order .",
    "instead , peaks in the susceptibility that are often associated with the cdw originate through finite energy transitions from bands nested away from @xmath8 .",
    "we show that this concept explains both the temperature dependent arpes spectral function,@xcite as well as why the material has courted controversy for so long .",
    "although fs nesting can be ruled out , the fermi wave vector , @xmath9 does play a role , both directly and ( more importantly ) indirectly , in determining the peaks in the susceptibility .",
    "we suggest that similar careful inspection of the @xmath2-resolved susceptibility function in other materials will be capable of discriminating between different models of charge , spin or superconducting order .",
    "the electronic structure has been calculated for @xmath10-tase@xmath0 using the full - potential linear augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) elk code within the local density approximation ( lda),@xcite including spin - orbit coupling self - consistently , and using the experimental structural parameters.@xcite relaxation of the unit cell was not found to significantly affect the band structure , particularly near @xmath8 .",

    "@xcite the scalar relativistic bands are degenerate across the entire top face ( @xmath16 ) of the bz .",
    "however , with the inclusion of relativistic effects ( in the form of spin - orbit coupling ) this restriction is lifted , and the degeneracy is broken .",
    "this has important , and non - trivial , effects on the fs , allowing the barrel and dogbone fs sheets to be fully disconnected everywhere ( except along @xmath17 ) in the zone , which ultimately leads to a much more 2d dogbone fs ( which , in turn , ought to enhance the propensity for nesting ) .      in order to parameterize the experimental @xmath18 relation , a simple 2d tight - binding",

    "fermi velocities of the two bands ensure that this is true over a large energy range . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the @xmath70 vector does not connect to pieces of fs , and instead the fs of each band is connected to a finite energy _",
    "away _ from the fs of the other band . this explains why intensity at the fs is visible in fig .",
    "[ f : chiqk](b ) , but very weak in @xmath69 .",
    "although some transitions are available at the fs , there are many more at finite energy which overwhelm the low - energy transitions .",
    "this concept has similarities , although is more general , to the idea of `` hidden nesting'',@xcite and has been used to explain finite energy transitions in 1d materials in which fs nesting is ` hidden ' by band hybridization effects .",
    "we note that although this explanation was mentioned by ref .  , who also categorically ruled out fs nesting , reports of fs nesting - driven cdw order in the dichalcogenides still pervade the literature .",
    "this explanation of the susceptibility also provides a natural explanation for why the fs has been implicated in previous studies . to illustrate this , we consider two bands that have equal and opposite velocities near @xmath8 , similar to the case for tase@xmath0 in fig .  [ f :",

    "are satisfied for @xmath89 , and are weighted by the energy separation , @xmath90 .",
    "the integrals over @xmath86 and @xmath87 , however , are symmetric about @xmath8 , and this function must peak at @xmath91 , regardless of whether states near @xmath8 contribute or not . over the full energy window , corresponding to @xmath92 , the function peaks at this wave vector , not due to fs transitions but rather due to finite energy transitions ( or deep energy nesting ) .",
    "more generally , in 2d systems this effect is spread out by dispersion over the second momentum axis , which serves to relax the above idealized arguments .",
    "nevertheless , it is _ not _ coincidental that the fs has the same ( albeit weak ) nesting vector , but a consequence of the expansion of the transitions about this energy .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the temperature dependence of the arpes spectral function , which becomes gapped ( by @xmath93  mev ) in the commensurate cdw phase below 90  k.@xcite the gapping of the fs occurs most strongly on the @xmath14 barrels , which completely disappear , as well as on the long sections of the @xmath15 dogbone fs ( e.g.  the dogbone crossings along the @xmath94 direction ) . these are precisely the parts of the fs that were implicated in fig .  [",
    "f : chiqk](c ) as being involved in the finite energy deep nesting .",
    "to summarize , we have _ experimentally _ shown that the electronic instability at the fs is not sufficient to drive cdw order in 2_h_-tase@xmath0 .",
    "instead , mechanisms that do not rely on details of the fs are more likely candidates for driving cdw order .",
    "for example , recent models include the wave vector dependence of the electron - phonon coupling,@xcite the condensation of preformed excitons,@xcite or strong electron - lattice coupling.@xcite the importance of analyzing the @xmath2-dependence of the susceptibility function , at a suitable peak in @xmath1-space , is clearly reflected in our ability to confidently identify _ which _ electronic states contribute to the susceptibility at the ordering wavevector .",
    "for example , previous experimental studies , which were based on either the autocorrelation,@xcite or a tb fit,@xcite of the arpes fs ( rather than analyzing a large energy range ) , concluded that fs nesting was important in driving the cdw of tase@xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the analysis of the @xmath2-dependence enables us to firmly rule this out , despite the similarity of our @xmath2-integrated function to that of ref .  , bringing a much - needed consensus between arpes experiment and theory .",
    "finally , we consider the situation in the absence of bilayer splitting through calculations of monolayer tase@xmath0 . in the monolayer ,",
    "the interband transitions that were identified in the previous discussion of bulk tase@xmath0 are not available , and instead just a single band contributes to the near-@xmath8 electronic structure . moreover ,",

    "however , the @xmath2-dependence of the susceptibility is quite different in the monolayer , being restricted to narrow strips near the saddle band region .",
    "these results demonstrate the sensitivity of the @xmath102-resolved susceptibility to changes in the active states at a particular @xmath1-vector , and illustrate its value in assessing the origin of instabilities in the electronic subsystem .",

    "<S> the connection between the fermi surface and charge - density wave ( cdw ) order is revisited in 2_h_-tase@xmath0 . using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , _ ab initio _ band structure calculations , and an accurate tight - binding model , we develop the _ empirical _ * k*-resolved susceptibility function , which we use to highlight states that contribute to the susceptibility for a particular * q*-vector . </S>",
    "<S> we show that although the fermi surface is involved in the peaks in the susceptibility associated with cdw order , it is _ not _ through conventional fermi surface nesting , but rather through finite energy transitions from states located far from the fermi level . </S>",
