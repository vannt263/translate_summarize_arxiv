    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) at optical and infrared wavelengths is among the most significant developments in modern observations of galaxies at all redshifts because it combines the benefits of two - dimensional photometric analysis with physical diagnostics of baryon composition and kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "recent advances now enable multi - object ifs with instruments such as sami @xcite , kmos @xcite , and manga @xcite . as a part of the 4th generation of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iv ) , the manga ( mapping nearby galaxies at apo ) project @xcite bundles fibers from the boss ( baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ) spectrograph @xcite into integral - field units to obtain spatially resolved optical spectroscopy of 10,000 nearby galaxies over a 6 year survey .",
    "early results obtained with prototype manga hardware @xcite demonstrate the richness of the data for exploring the stellar and gas composition .",
    "because current large - format detectors lack energy resolution throughout most of the electromagnetic spectrum , ifs has adopted a range of technical approaches to down - selecting and formatting a subset of the three - dimensional data cube of wavelength and spatial position onto a two - dimensional detector array .",
    "these approaches yield different , science - driven trades in the data - cube sampling .",
    "simultaneous and integral coverage of the spatial field is desirable and achieved by a number of instruments using lenslets ( e.g. , sauron , osiris ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or image slicers ( e.g. , sinfoni , muse ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the two current wide - field , multi - object , ifs instruments  sami and manga  use bare - fiber arrays to minimize cost while maximizing flexibility and patrol area , but at the penalty of not achieving truly integral spatial coverage at any one time",
    ". this shortfall can be overcome by careful attention to the interplay of the hardware design of the fiber bundles and the observing strategy .",
    "the most immediate challenge is that the manga fiber bundle , composed of circular apertures with large interstitial gaps that significantly undersample the psf at the focal plane of the telescope , has a non - uniform response across each ifu .",
    "this means that ( under most techniques for the reconstruction of images from the data ) the appearance of objects that are small with respect to the fiber size ( e.g. , agn or  regions ) can vary across an ifu .",
    "the reconstructed image of such unresolved objects can either look small and circular ( if the object was centered on a single fiber ) , large and circular ( if the object was centered in the interstitial gap between three fibers ) , highly elongated ( if the object was centered midway between two fibers ) , along with any range of shapes in between .",
    "this is highly undesirable from a science standpoint , and therefore typical fiber - bundle ifu surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) dither their observations .",
    "small dithers of a fraction of the fiber spacing sample the missing points in the image plane and allow reconstructed images based on multiple , dithered exposures to achieve fairly uniform and integral spatial coverage .",
    "this dithering is complicated by atmospheric refraction however , especially given the extremely wide spatial and spectral coverage of manga .",
    "chromatic differential refraction over the manga wavelength range ( @xmath8  ) can be comparable to the diameter of individual fibers , and field differential refraction ( from variation in the amount and direction of refraction over the @xmath9 field of an sdss plugplate ) contributes similarly .",
    "these effects combine to degrade the effectiveness of a regular dithering scheme in sampling the image plane .",
    "this paper presents simulations that explore the impact of these effects on the expected manga data quality , and thereby constrain the hardware design and observing strategy for the survey . in ",
    "[ hardware.sec ] we give an overview of the sdss 2.5 m telescope and plugplate system , along with a brief description of the manga legacy hardware and ifu ferrule designs considered for the survey .",
    "we describe the basic design considerations for the survey in  [ basics.sec ] . using the science requirements summarized in  [ reqperformance.sec ] , typical integration times set by the read noise characteristics of our detectors (  [ itime.sec ] ) , and numerical simulations (  [ simulations.sec ] )",
    "we motivate the need for dithered observations and regular hexagonal packing of the ifu fiber bundles , culminating in a baseline hardware design and observing strategy described in  [ baseline-strat.sec ] .",
    "this baseline observing strategy is significantly complicated by atmospheric differential refraction , and we discuss the impact of chromatic and field differential refraction on our data quality in  [ ar.chromatic.sec ] and [ ar.field.sec ] respectively , defining a uniformity statistic @xmath10 to describe the data quality in  [ omega.sec ] . using the @xmath10 statistic",

    "manga operates on the sdss 2.5-m telescope @xcite located at apache point observatory ( apo ; latitude @xmath11 ) .",
    "the telescope is a modified ritchey - chretien with alt - az mount that is designed with an interchangeable cartridge system that can be installed at the cassegrain focus .",
    "the manga hardware is described in greater detail by @xcite ; here we briefly review the major salient features of the system .",
    "manga has 6 cartridges , each of which contains a plugplate with a field of view @xmath12 in diameter that has been pre - drilled with holes corresponding to the locations of target galaxies into which optical fibers and ifus can be plugged each day in preparation for a night of observing .",
    "these plates are fixed at zero degrees position angle ( i.e. , the on - sky orientation of the telescope focal plane coordinate reference frame is fixed ) .",
    "each manga cartridge has a total of 1423 fibers ( 709 on spectrograph 1 , 714 on spectrograph 2 ) , corresponding to 17 science ifus ranging in size from 19 to 127 fibers ( @xmath13 arcsec diameter ; 1247 fibers total ) , twelve 7-fiber mini - bundles used for spectrophotometic calibration ( 84 fibers total ; see yan et al . in prep ) , and 92 single fibers used for sky subtraction that can be deployed within a 14 radius of their associated ifu harness .",
    "each ifu has its rotation fixed using alignment pins in the ferrules that plug into corresponding alignment holes located a short distance west of each target galaxy .",
    "these optical fibers feed the twin boss ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey , ) spectrographs @xcite .",
    "the collimated beams in each spectrograph are split with a dichroic and feed a blue ( @xmath14  ) and red camera ( @xmath15  ) .",

    "* schlegel et al . in prep )    the telescope guider system is optimized for a wavelength of @xmath20 5500   and uses endoscopic fibers inserted into 16 holes in each plugplate corresponding to the locations of bright guide stars .",
    "these endoscopic fibers produce images of the guide stars on a guider camera , and the guider actively adjusts the focus , scale , rotation , and offset of the telescope focal plane to track these stars through varying weather conditions and observing angles .",
    "the ability of an ifu fiber bundle to deliver good , repeatable , and uniform image quality depends most fundamentally on the arrangement of fibers within the bundle ; while dithering (  [ dithering.sec ] ) , differential refraction (  [ ar.sec ] ) , and other considerations are important , the fiber placement sets the basis for the sampling regularity of the entire survey .",
    "as described by @xcite , the manga fibers have an inner light - sensitive core diameter ( i d ) of 120 @xmath2 ( corresponding to 2.0 arcsec in the telescope focal plane ) and an outer diameter ( od ) of @xmath21 @xmath2 with their protective buffers and cladding .",
    "we originally considered two kinds of fiber bundles for manga , as illustrated in figure [ bundlesims0.fig ] .",
    "the first was a circular bundle of fibers that maximizes the filling factor of light - sensitive fiber cores relative to the total ifu footprint by chemically stripping the protective buffers from the ends of each fiber .",
    "as developed for the sami survey by @xcite , these ` sydney - style ' bundles maximize the effective filling factor at the cost of decreased fiber throughput due to focal ratio degradation ( frd ) , greater fragility of the glass cores , and irregular fiber packing due to the circular ferrule geometry .",
    "based on the numerical performance simulations described in  [ regularity.sec ] ,",
    "we prototyped ( and ultimately chose to adopt ) a second style of fiber bundle composed of a regular arrangement of buffered fibers within a tapered hexagonal ferrule for which we pioneered a novel construction technique ( see details in * ? ? ?",
    "while reaching lower effective filling factor , this technique improves fiber throughput , % throughput with an exit f - ratio of f/4 for fibers fed at f/5 .",
    "in contrast , the original sami bundles achieved 50 - 75% throughput with an exit f - ratio of f/3.15 fed at f/3.4 . we note that the frd of even the second - generation sami bundles ( fig . 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is sufficiently large that it would require our optics to be 40% larger in area to collect the same ensquared energy given the sloan telescope feed . ]",
    "decreases breakage , 6 months of operation , 7 individual fibers within ifus have broken ( 1 in manufacturing , 1 in assembly , 5 in operation ) , representing @xmath22% of the total .",
    "detailed statistics on the breakage frequency of stripped , fused fiber bundles are unknown but would have represented a significant cost increase in manufacturing .",
    "] and ( by virtue of its hexagonal geometry ) permits extremely regular fiber placement within each ifu .",
    "the theoretical effective fiber packing density of the hexagonal ifus can be defined as the ratio of the total fiber core area ( @xmath23 ) to the area of the hexagon circumscribing the fiber bundle ( @xmath24 ) , where :    @xmath25    @xmath26    here @xmath27  is the outer diameter of an individual fiber , @xmath28  is the thickness of the fiber buffer and cladding , and @xmath29 is the number of ` rings ' in the bundle ( @xmath30 for a 19-fiber ifu , and @xmath31 for a 127-fiber ifu ) . in figure [ fillfac.fig ]",
    "we plot the effective filling factor @xmath32 as a function of the buffer thickness @xmath33 . in accord with these predictions , the prototype circular sydney - style bundles ( whose fibers are chemically etched to an outer diameter of @xmath34 ) achieve a filling factor of @xmath35% , while the as - built hexagonal bundles with fully - buffered fibers achieve a filling factor of 56% .",
    "since the fiber bundles consist of 2  diameter circular apertures separated by large interstitial gaps , each exposure will significantly undersample the point spread function ( psf ) at the focal plane of the telescope ( typically @xmath36  ) and produce a non - uniform response function across the face of each ifu .",
    "we require that the manga ifus deliver sufficiently uniform performance that physical structures do not vary in shape as a function of where they happen to fall within the ifu ( i.e. , a circular star forming region within a galaxy should appear circular in the final manga data cube regardless of whether it is in the center or the outskirts of the galaxy ) .    a convenient way to place",
    "a limit on the level of uniformity required is to ensure that variations in the 2d psf of the reconstructed manga data cubes do not significantly impact measurements of the balmer decrement or bpt - style ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) line ratio diagrams .",
    "since atmospheric differential refraction shifts the effective position of each fiber as a function of wavelength (  [ ar.sec ] ) , [ ]  and  observations of a given  region for instance will be obtained with a slightly _ different _ configuration of fibers  while  emission may be centered in a given fiber , spatially coincident [ ]  emission may be centered in the interstitial region between fibers .",
    "as outlined in the manga science requirements document ( srd ; see yan et al . in prep )",
    ", relative spectophotometry between [ ]  ( @xmath37  ) and h@xmath38 ( @xmath39  ) must be accurate to 7% or better in order to obtain the desired constraints on the star formation rate ( sfr ) and nebular metallicity within galaxies .",
    "we therefore explore how this required spectrophotometric accuracy translates to limits on the spatial variability of the manga psf .",
    "we begin by assuming that the psf in a typical manga reconstructed data cube can be characterized by a circular gaussian with a fwhm of 2.5 arcsec ( as we discuss at greater length in law et al .",
    ", in prep , this model is a good approximation to the manga commissioning data ) .",
    "using typical aperture photometry techniques , a circular aperture of radius @xmath40 arcsec ( i.e. , 2.5 times the radial scalelength of the psf ) would nominally enclose 96% of the total flux . in figure [ fluxfig.fig ]",
    "we illustrate how deviations from the nominal psf model would affect this total ; as the psf becomes broader or more elongated the flux contained within the fixed aperture decreases , meaning that the derived aperture - corrected total fluxes would be in error .",
    "kolmogorov atmospheric turbulence profile are taken into account in determining the appropriate aperture . ] in particular , we find that an error of 20% in the profile fwhm and 15% in the profile minor / major axis ratio is sufficient to bias the resulting flux measurements at the 7% level ( filled star in figure [ fluxfig.fig ] ) .    similarly , in order to ensure that our limiting fluxes for _ undetected _ nebular transition features are accurate at the 7% level",
    "we also require that the signal - to - noise ratio of our data is constant at the 7% level across each ifu .",
    "since the limiting flux is proportional to the square root of the exposure time , this translates to a requirement that the exposure time is effectively constant across each ifu at the 15% level .",
    "these three metrics ( circularity , fwhm , and signal - to - noise ratio ) therefore set our _ requirements _ on the uniformity of the reconstructed image profile such that the calibrated fluxes derived from manga data cubes are accurate at the 7% level .",
    "ideally , however , we would prefer that spatial sampling issues not dominate the flux calibration accuracy budget for the manga data cubes , and we therefore set a _ goal _ of achieving photometric performance at the 3.5% level where possible .",
    "the manga hardware construction , dithering pattern , and observing strategy is therefore set by the following three high - level considerations :    1 .",
    "the reconstructed fwhm of all angular resolution elements in a bundle should vary by @xmath41 10% ( goal ) or 20% ( requirement ) across each ifu .",
    "the reconstructed minor - to - major axis ratio of all resolution elements in a bundle should be @xmath42 ( goal ) or 0.85 ( requirement ) across each ifu .",
    "the effective integration time of all resolution elements in a bundle should vary by @xmath41 7% ( goal ) or 15% ( requirement ) across each ifu .",
    "the total integration time is set by our requirement that manga reach a signal - to - noise ratio of 5 @xmath4 fiber@xmath4 in the @xmath5-band continuum at a surface brightness of 23 ab arcsec@xmath6 . as described by wake et al .",
    "( in prep . ) and",
    "yan et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "the typical integration time per plate to reach this target is anticipated to be about 3 hours in median conditions . in good conditions",
    "however the required time could be as low as 1.5 - 2 hours , and for particularly low - latitude fields the required time could be as much as 4 - 5 hours .",
    "this substantial variation in total exposure time requires an observing strategy flexible enough to accommodate it .",
    "the optimal integration time for individual exposures is constrained by the manga hardware and typical background sky spectrum at apo .",
    "one of the strengths of manga is the high throughput of the boss spectrographs shortward of 4000  , and we therefore integrate each exposure for long enough that the shot noise from the background sky spectrum and detector dark current exceeds the read noise .",
    "the total noise @xmath43 as a function of wavelength is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the background sky spectrum in units of e@xmath46 minute@xmath4 per spectral pixel , @xmath47 is the dark current in e@xmath46 pixel@xmath4 minute@xmath4 , @xmath48 is the read noise in e@xmath46 pixel@xmath4 , @xmath49 pixels is the spatial width of a spectrum on the detector ( see discussion by law et al . in prep ) , and @xmath33 is the integration time of an exposure in minutes . rearranging eqn .",
    "[ noise.eqn ] we find the time @xmath50 required for the combined sky background and dark current to equal the read noise :    @xmath51    we estimate @xmath45 for a typical manga dark - time observation using commissioning data from all - sky plate 7341 ( i.e. , a calibration plate for which all ifus target regions of blank sky ) observed on mjd 56693 . following the data model outlined by law et al .",
    "( in prep ) , we take the flux array of the reduced mgframe file ( in units of flatfielded e@xmath52 per spectral pixel ) , multiply by the superflat array to obtain spectra in raw @xmath53 per spectral pixel , and combine @xmath54 individual fiber spectra to construct an extremely high - precision model of the background sky .",
    "we take the detector read noise to be @xmath55 ( 2.8 ) e@xmath46 pixel@xmath4 , and the dark current to be 0.033 ( 0.066 ) e@xmath46 pixel@xmath4 minute@xmath4 for the blue ( red ) camera ( see table 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .% of the dark - time sky background signal .",
    "]    we plot @xmath50 as a function of wavelength in figure [ inttime.fig ] , and note that the sky background rapidly dominates over read noise at almost all wavelengths , especially in the vicinity of strong oh atmospheric emission lines in the near - ir .",
    "the upturn in @xmath50 shortward of 4000   represents the falloff in blue sensitivity of the detectors , but an integration time of 15 minutes per exposure ensures that observations are shot - noise dominated for all @xmath56  .",
    "although an integration time of longer than 15 minutes would further decrease the contribution of read noise to the total error budget , such longer integrations are undesirable because of the cosmic ray event rate recorded by the red - channel detectors . in practice , the maximum integration time of each exposure is also limited by differential atmospheric refraction considerations ( see  [ omegaexp.sec ] ) , and we therefore adopt a nominal time of 15 minutes per exposure .",
    "each completed plate will therefore consist of @xmath57 exposures in order to reach the target depth .        in order to assess the relative performance of different ifu bundles and observing techniques we perform a series of numerical simulations designed to test the uniformity of their response to unresolved point sources ( for which spatial structure is most pronounced ) . adopting a working box size of @xmath58 arcsec with simulated pixels spaced every @xmath59 arcsec we first compute the footprint of a given ifu ; this defines a mask image for which each fiber in the ifu is associated with a given set of pixels in the telescope focal plane that its light - sensitive core subtends .",
    "we then create an input ` image ' to be observed by the simulated manga ifus by convolving a delta function by a model of the psf at the focal plane of the sdss 2.5-m telescope .",
    "this focal - plane psf is taken to be the sum of two gaussian profiles with fwhm @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively ( where @xmath62 arcsec is the fwhm of the median atmospheric seeing profile divided by 1.05 ) and peak amplitude ratio of 9/1 . plus",
    "4/13 times the input image convolved with a gaussian of fwhm @xmath63 .",
    "this profile provides a reasonable approximation of the on - axis sdss focal plane psf , matching the inner parts of the profile well and accounting for most of the flux in the outer wings ( j.e .",
    "gunn , priv .",
    "comm . ) . ]",
    "this input image is convolved with the top - hat fiber mask to determine the total amount of light received by each fiber ; although the present simulation considers only a single input image the technique is immediately generalizable to multi - wavelength input image slices .",
    "we reconstruct a two - dimensional image from the individual fiber fluxes using a flux - conserving variant of shepards method ( inverse - distance weighting ) similar to that used by the califa survey @xcite . as part of manga design simulations we explored alternative methods of image reconstruction such as drizzling ( e.g. , as adopted by sami ,",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thin - plate - spline fits , minimum curvature surface fits , and kriging . as discussed by law et al .",
    "( in prep ) the modified shepard s method yielded the best results , and here we adopt the same parameters ( e.g. , final spaxel scale of 0.5 arcsec ) as used by the manga data reduction pipeline ( drp ) for genuine survey data . the reconstructed image is fit with a 2d gaussian model to determine its fwhm and axial ratio ; major axis rotation is left as a free parameter .",
    "this exercise is repeated for delta functions located in each of the 0.1 arcsec grid squares that lie within the central 75% of the ifu fiber bundle footprint ( i.e. , ignoring edge effects from point sources located on the outer ring of an ifu ) , resulting in @xmath64 simulated points across a 127-fiber ifu bundle . in figure [ bundlesims1.fig ] ( top row )",
    "we plot the on - sky footprint of a hexagonal fiber array , along with the variations in effective exposure time ( exposure time multiplied by the fraction of the total light that is collected by fibers rather than being lost to interstitial regions ) , fwhm , and minor - to - major axis ratio of the reconstructed point spread function ( psf ) as a function of the location of the point source within the fiber bundle .",
    "as anticipated , we note that all three quantities vary substantially across a given ifu in a single exposure .",
    "we quantify these results by calculating the rms of the distributions in effective exposure time and reconstructed psf fwhm ( relative to the median values as @xmath65/x_{\\rm median}$ ] ) , the @xmath66 width @xmath67 encompassing 99% of these values , and the 99% lower bound for the minor - to - major axis ratio .",
    "for a single exposure , the effective integration time varies by @xmath68% around the median value ; unsurprisingly , the greatest fraction of the total light is recorded for objects that are centered in a fiber , while the least amount is recorded for objects in interstitial regions .",
    "similarly , the reconstructed psf fwhm varies by almost 80% ( from @xmath20 2 to 4 arcsec ) depending on where a source falls with respect to the fiber grid , and the minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath69 of the reconstructed image varies from @xmath70 ( 99% of values @xmath71 ) .    in practical terms",
    ", this means that an unresolved  region observed with such an ifu for just a single exposure may appear to be compact and circularly symmetric if it lands directly in the middle of a fiber , elongated and skinny if it falls directly between two fibers , or large and triangular if it falls midway between three adjacent fibers . allowing for the effects of chromatic differential refraction (  [ ar.chromatic.sec ] ) , this means that a single such  region may simultaneously be sampled by _ all three _ different such configurations at different wavelengths .",
    "the sampling irregularities from fiber - bundle ifus with substantial interstitial light losses are well known from previous ifu surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and can be largely overcome by obtaining dithered observations .",
    "the geometry of the hexagonal fiber arrangement readily lends itself to a fixed triangular three - point dithering scheme that effectively fills the interstitial regions as illustrated in figure [ dither.fig ] . repeating the simulations performed in  [ simmethod.sec ] with such dithered observations , we find that the combined data from just three exposures is able to achieve remarkably uniform image quality at all locations within a single ifu ( figure [ bundlesims1.fig ] , bottom row ) .",
    "in contrast to the undithered case , 3-point dithering delivers effective exposure time constant to within 0.3% rms , fwhm of @xmath72 arcsec , and ellipticity @xmath73 .",
    "this uniformity easily meets the manga science requirements described in  [ reqperformance.sec ] .",
    "logically , the 3-point dithering pattern could be expanded to a regular 9-point pattern that also provides uniform coverage of the interstitial gaps , but with a finer sampling of the image plane .",
    "although simulations suggest that this could provide @xmath74% improvement in the delivered psf fwhm , such gains were not realized on - sky in tests with the manga prototype hardware .",
    "this lack of improvement with respect to theoretical calculations is likely due to a confluence of numerous complicating factors , including degradation of the nominal dithering pattern by atmospheric refraction ( see  [ ar.sec ] ) , variations in fiber - to - fiber sensitivity , and changes in seeing and transparency conditions between exposures ( see  [ weather.sec ] ) .      the gains achievable with",
    "such dithering depend fundamentally on the uniformity of each ifu fiber bundle so that a single telescope offset can simultaneously dither each of our 29 ifus ( 17 science and 12 calibration bundles ) across the @xmath9 field such that their fibers align with the interstitial gaps from the previous exposure .",
    "if fibers are not located at regular positions within every ifu , the dithering will not be able to uniformly sample the image plane .",
    "we explore the effect of fiber packing irregularity by repeating our earlier simulations with the introduction of a random perturbation to the position of each fiber in the simulated ifu fiber bundle , such that each fiber is slightly offset from its nominal position by some distance drawn randomly from a gaussian distribution with a given rms .",
    "each simulated ifu bundle is observed with a nominal 3-pt dither pattern as defined by figure [ dither.fig ] .",
    "additionally , we simulate the effect of observing the circular sydney - style fiber bundle with a 7-point dither pattern ( based on that adopted by the sami survey ) that compensates for the irregular fiber placement with greater filling factor and a larger number of dithered sampling points .    as indicated by figure [ bundlesims2.fig ] , neither the dithered sydney - style circular fiber bundle nor the 20 @xmath75 m tolerance hexagonal fiber bundles meet our target regularity goals , with a recovered psf fwhm varying by @xmath76% over the extent of an ifu ( i.e. , @xmath77 arcsec with 99% values ranging from @xmath20 2.3 - 2.9 arcsec ) , and minor / major axis ratios as low as @xmath78 .",
    "in contrast , using a hexagonal fiber array constructed to a tolerance of 5  rms with a 3-point dither pattern we expect to achieve a psf fwhm that varies by less than 10% over a given ifu .",
    "as detailed by @xcite , the as - built manga fiber bundles meet and exceed our target threshold with a typical fiber placement accuracy of 3  rms . using the as - measured fiber metrology for 127-fiber manga bundle ma024",
    ", we simulate the anticipated performance using this fiber bundle in row e of figure [ bundlesims2.fig ] . with a nominal dither pattern we expect to achieve a psf fwhm which varies by less than 7% over an ifu ( i.e. , @xmath79 arcsec with 99% values ranging from @xmath20 2.6 to 2.7 arcsec ) , and",
    "has a nearly circular profile everywhere with @xmath80 .",
    "the dithered observing simulations presented in  [ dithering.sec ] and exposure time requirements described in  [ itime.sec ] motivate a nominal observing scheme in which targets are observed in * sets * of 3 dithered exposures ( n - s - e ) of 15 minutes each .",
    "given the regularity of fiber placement with each ifu and the locator pins that constrain each ifu to have the same position angle , correctly - dithered exposures can be simultaneously obtained for all ifus on a given plate by simply offsetting the telescope pointing with respect to the guide stars .",
    "since the coverage and image quality of a single set of three dithered exposures is known to be acceptably uniform , the total summed coverage of @xmath43 such sets will also be uniform and have a depth of @xmath81 hours , allowing us to simply observe additional sets of 3 exposures until the combined data reaches our target signal - to - noise ratio of 5 @xmath4 fiber@xmath4 in the @xmath5-band continuum at a surface brightness of 23 ab arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "such a scheme provides us with considerable flexibility to adjust our total exposure time in 45-minute increments without adversely impacting the delivered data quality whether there are 6 or 20 total exposures for a given galaxy .",
    "it is this flexibility as much as the dithered performance simulations themselves that drives us to adopt the regular hexagonal fiber arrays for manga rather than the sami - style circular fiber bundles , which rely upon a large number of exposures at many different dither positions to statistically fill in the interstitial gaps .",
    "however , since this technique relies upon tightly controlling the fiber locations to provide uniform coverage we must properly mitigate a variety of effects that will act to degrade this uniformity , and this goal in turn drives many aspects of the survey operation .",
    "as a photon passes through the earth s atmosphere it is refracted by variations in the density of the air . under the usual assumption of a plane - parallel atmosphere with a vertical density gradient",
    "this bends the light from an astronomical target along the parallactic angle ( the great circle connecting the target and the observers local zenith ) , causing astronomical objects to appear slightly higher in the sky than they truly are .",
    "atmospheric refraction introduces significant optical distortions that adversely affect our ability to dither our ifu observations to the desired accuracy . loosely speaking",
    ", the effects can be split into _ chromatic differential refraction _ and _ field differential refraction _ which we detail below .",
    "atmospheric refraction is a function of atmospheric conditions ( temperature , pressure , and relative humidity ) , zenith distance ( i.e. , the amount of atmosphere that an incoming photon must traverse ) , and wavelength .",
    "the impact of such refraction on astronomical observations has been studied at some length in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the sdss 2.5-m telescope is equipped with an alt - az mount and all plates are observed with a position angle of @xmath93 , so the amount of refraction in focal - plane coordinatesxfocal corresponds to @xmath94right ascension and @xmath94yfocal corresponds to @xmath94declination . ]",
    "is given by @xmath95 @xmath96 i.e. , at transit @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and hence the entirety of the apparent refraction is along the yfocal direction .    since differential refraction ( particularly shortward of 4000  )",
    "can be substantial compared to the fiber radius of 1 arcsec ( see figure [ darfig.fig ] ) the spectrum recorded by a single fiber is not strictly the spectrum of a single region in a given galaxy ; it is a bent tube that traces different regions of the galaxy at different wavelengths .",
    "most immediately , this means that the effective on - sky footprint of the manga ifus can be shifted by up to @xmath20 1 arcsec between blue and red wavelengths , requiring that the manga data reduction pipeline ( drp ; see law et al . in prep ) rectify the spectra to a common astrometric grid when reconstructing the data cubes .",
    "more problematically , since the three exposures in a given dither set will be obtained at different hour angles the relative offset at a given wavelength will change between these three exposures and degrade the intended dither pattern coverage .    at the guide wavelength of 5500  , the three dithers will be executed properly . as illustrated in figure [ dareffect.fig ]",
    "however , at other wavelengths there will be variable shifts of the effective dithering pattern .",
    "these shifts can in some cases be comparable to the dither distances themselves , thereby degrading the effective dither pattern such that entire dither postions can be effectively ` lost ' at certain wavelengths . as suggested by figures [ bundlesims1.fig ] and [ bundlesims2.fig ] this produces substantial and undesirable non - uniformities in the reconstructed image depth and recovered fwhm profile across the face of each ifu .",
    "in addition to varying with wavelength , both the magnitude and the direction of atmospheric refraction vary according to the location of an object on the sky , and the @xmath9 sdss plugplate field over which our ifus are distributed is sufficiently large that this variation can not be neglected . as a given field rises , transits , and sets , the apparent locations of astronomical targets in the telescope focal plane shift . as described in ",
    "[ hardware.sec ] , the sdss telescope guider system compensates for this using guide fibers placed on astrometric standard stars distributed throughout a given field , and adjusts the overall shift , rotation , and scale of the focal plane to compensate .",
    "however , since field compression occurs along only a single direction ( altitude ) it can not be fully corrected by a global change in the focal plane scale , leaving a residual quadrupole term in the guider - corrected focal plane locations of the target galaxies ( see figure [ allfield.fig ] ) .",
    "such field differential effects are most noticeable when observing with single fibers or an array of slits ( see , e.g. , discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "* for the 16 x 16 vimos field of view ) since targets can rapidly shift out of the aperture .",
    "hence , previous generations of sdss that have used single fiber spectroscopy have been careful to observe at hour angles close to that for which a given plate is drilled .",
    "in contrast , manga is relatively insensitive to shifts in the effective centroid of an ifu since such shifts are small compared to the total field of view of each ifu ( @xmath99 arcsec for the 127-fiber ifus ) .",
    "the manga plugplates are therefore all drilled for transit ( @xmath97 hours ) , so the holes into which the manga ifus are inserted correspond to the expected focal plane locations of the galaxies at this point in time .",
    "more important for manga is the _ change _ in field differential refraction between exposures in a given dither set , which leads to degradation of the effective dither pattern akin to what was seen for chromatic differential refraction in figure [ dareffect.fig ] . as illustrated by figure [ allfield.fig ] , the magnitude of this effect depends on the field declination , the hour angle @xmath84 of exposures within a given set , and the location of an ifu within the plugplate . in the extreme example shown in figure [ allfield.fig ] ( low declination , with exposures obtained many hours apart )",
    "the shift can be comparable to a fiber diameter . in more realistic and typical cases ( field center at @xmath100 ,",
    "observed at @xmath97 and @xmath101 hours ) the shift after guider corrections is typically @xmath102 arcsec .",
    "given the presence of both chromatic and field differential refraction , _ no two exposures _ taken by manga will have an identical fiber sampling pattern even in the absence of dithering .",
    "the primary driver of the manga observing strategy is therefore mitigation of the impact of atmospheric differential refraction on the regularity of the dither pattern in order to achieve maximally - uniform data quality and depth within a given ifu .",
    "given any two exposures separated by a time @xmath103 there are vectors @xmath104 and @xmath105 defining the effective offset of a fiber from its intended location on the target galaxy due to chromatic differential refraction , and @xmath106 and @xmath107 the offset due to uncorrectable field differential refraction effects . in our rectilinear focal - plane coordinate system",
    "the total shifts from differential refraction are given by : @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the respective parallactic angles for the two exposures and the vectors @xmath106 and @xmath107 are each projected into their components along the x / y focal plane coordinate system .",
    "the quantity of interest for survey planning purposes is the total distance between these shifted locations in the focal plane :    @xmath111    in practice , we calculate @xmath10 between the first and last exposures in a dithered set of three frames ( see illustrative diagram in figure [ dareffect.fig ] ) .",
    "( although see  [ omegaexp.sec ] ) . ] using the tools developed in  [ simulations.sec ] we simulate four test cases where @xmath10 ranges from 0 to 1  .",
    "we use the as - built manga 127-fiber ifu ma024 , and assume a standard three - point ( n - s - e ) dithering strategy in which exposure n is shifted by @xmath112 in the -xfocal direction , exposure s is shifted by @xmath113 in the -yfocal direction and exposure e is shifted by @xmath112 in the + xfocal direction ( see , e.g. , figure [ dareffect.fig ] ) .",
    "note that we are free to assume such symmetry because any shift common to all three exposures will simply result in a translation of the entire pattern .",
    "we show results for the expected exposure time , reconstructed psf fwhm , and reconstructed axis ratio uniformity as a function of @xmath10 in figure [ omegaeffect.fig ] .",
    "degrades the expect coverage pattern , we assume that the magnitude and direction of all of these shifts are known ( see discussion by law et al . in prep ) and the true effective locations of each fiber are used when reconstructing the data cube . ]",
    "figure [ omegasims.fig ] suggests that so long as @xmath114 arcsec observations should meet the target uniformity criteria outlined in  [ regularity.sec ] with fwhm @xmath115 arcsec . at @xmath116 arcsec ,",
    "degradations in the reconstructed psf uniformity and circularity start to become apparent ; although the mean reconstructed psf in the bundle has fwhm @xmath117 arcsec the total spread of fwhm values can be as large as @xmath118 arcsec , and 99% of locations have minor / major axis ratio greater than 0.85 .",
    "by @xmath119 arcsec the dither pattern is badly degraded , with reconstructed fwhm values varying by over an arcsecond depending on where a point source falls within the bundle .",
    "our science requirements (  [ reqperformance.sec ] ) therefore translate to a requirement that @xmath120 arcsec , with the goal of reaching @xmath121 arcsec for the majority of observations so that it does not dominate the flux calibration accuracy budget .",
    "as described above , @xmath10 is a complicated function of wavelength , integration time , target declination , hour angle , and location of an ifu on a given plate .",
    "however , it is possible to define a series of relatively simple observing guidelines that will ensure that @xmath10 stays below our 0.4 arcsec threshold .",
    "first , we note that @xmath10 behaves nearly linearly with the amount of elapsed time between exposures in a given set , meaning that it is desirable to obtain all three exposures in the set as close in time to each other as possible .",
    "since each exposure is 15 minutes long , we therefore require that all three exposures be obtained in a * set length * of one hour ( i.e. , the change in hour angle between the start of the first exposure and the end of the last exposure should be 1 hour or less , corresponding to 45 minutes between the effective midpoint of the first and last exposure ) .",
    "while we expect that each set of three exposures will typically last 48 minutes accounting for typical readout times and overheads , this hour - long block provides necessary flexibility in scheduling , especially during variable weather conditions .",
    "we next calculate the expected @xmath10 within a 1-hour long set as a function of the midpoint hour angle @xmath122 of the set ( @xmath122 denotes the absolute value of the hour angle midway between the start of the first and end of the last exposure ) . in figure [ omegasims.fig ]",
    "we show the results of this calculation for three different wavelengths , three locations on a plate , and a range of different declinations . at positive hour angles ( west of meridian ) and the other at negative hour angles ( east of meridian ) .",
    "for convenience we collapse the problem such that @xmath122 refers to the absolute value of the hour angle , and @xmath10 is taken to be the greater of the value from @xmath123 . ]",
    "as expected , @xmath10 is largest at extremely blue wavelengths ( for which chromatic differential refraction is greatest ) and on the edges of a plate ( where uncorrected field differential refraction is greatest ) .",
    "more importantly however , we note that @xmath10 grows rapidly with increasing hour angle ( either east or west of the meridian ) meaning that we want to obtain our observations as close to transit as possible",
    ". our @xmath10 limit therefore equates to defining a series of * visibility windows * around transit within which all manga observations must be taken .    in order to compute the length of these visibility windows we require that @xmath10 must be less than 0.4 arcsec for all sets , at all wavelengths , at all locations on a given plate , and at all declinations .",
    "as indicated by figure [ omegasims.fig ] , the worst wavelength for @xmath10 will be 3600  , where the chromatic refraction is greatest .",
    "we work out the worst location on a given plate as a function of declination by using monte carlo techniques to compute @xmath10 for each of 20,000 randomly chosen locations on an sdss plugplate over the course of a 1-hour set .",
    "as illustrated by figure [ plateomega.fig ] , the worst @xmath10 is typically for ifus located on the eastern / western edges of the plate for target declinations @xmath124 ; this pattern shifts at more northerly / southerly declinations .    using these simulations we finally have all of the pieces required to define our visibility windows . for",
    "a grid of declinations spaced every @xmath125 from @xmath126 to @xmath127 we compute the limiting set hour angle such that @xmath116 arcsec at @xmath128   at the worst location on a given plate . converting the set midpoint hour angle to the maximum midpoint hour angle of an individual exposure ( @xmath129 minutes for 1-hour sets )",
    ", we show the final visibility windows as a function of declination in figure [ haplot.fig ] .",
    "these windows range from about 1h either side of transit for fields near the celestial equator to @xmath130 hours for declinations @xmath131 .",
    "intriguingly , despite all of the complications involved in computing these visibility windows they are nearly equivalent to simple airmass limits , independent of field declination . as illustrated by figure [ haplot.fig ] , our visibility windows can be described as a 6th order polynomial as a function of declination , or more simply by the requirement that airmass am @xmath132 for all exposures at all declinations .",
    "this airmass limit is determined by the sdss plate diameter , the boss spectrograph wavelength coverage , and the assumed length of each set .",
    "we note that while these visibility windows have been established to ensure that @xmath120 arcsec at all wavelengths for all manga observations , _ typical _ performance is expected to be considerably better than this . at most wavelengths , most locations on a plate , and most hour angles within the visibility window @xmath10 will be 0.2 arcsec or below ( see , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ omegasims.fig ] and [ plateomega.fig ] ) .",
    "additionally , these simulations have assumed that sets are completed in one hour ( 45 minutes between the midpoint of first and last exposures in a set ) .",
    "early survey observations at apo suggest efficiency such that most sets are actually observed in more like 48 minutes ( 33 minutes between the midpoint of first and last exposures ) ; since @xmath10 scales roughly linearly with the set length we therefore expect on - sky performance to typically be a factor @xmath133% better than assumed in these simulations .",
    "additionally , irregular coverage of an astronomical target in one set of exposures will tend to be averaged out across many such sets , resulting in more uniform performance for the final data cube of a given source .",
    "thus far , all simulations have assumed that atmospheric seeing remains constant throughout all exposures in a given set , and that small variations in transparency can be normalized via per - exposure flux calibration ( although see  [ fluxaccuracy.sec ] ) .",
    "this assumption is often reasonable over the course of any given hour , but since rapid changes in observing conditions occur on some nights we must formulate our observing strategy accordingly .",
    "consider , for instance , the pathological case where two dithered exposures have been successfully obtained in good conditions , but the third is lost . whether it is never taken , or taken in extremely poor conditions ( e.g. , heavy cloud , seeing greater than 4 arcsec fwhm , etc . ) , the combined set of exposures no longer uniformly samples the source image .",
    "in such a situation , the missing exposure would have to be made up on another night , and obtained within a small range of allowable hour angles such that the total set length is still less than one hour .",
    "we therefore establish a series of additional requirements for image uniformity across exposures within a given set . based on simulations similar to those described in  [ simulations.sec ] and  [ omega.sec ] but allowing for variable seeing and transparency , we find that    * all exposures in a set should have seeing within 0.8 arcsec of each other .",
    "* all exposures in a set should have ( s / n)@xmath134 values within a factor of two of each other . *",
    "each set of exposures should have median seeing 2.0 arcsec or below in order for the reconstructed image to have fwhm less than 3 arcsec ( ensuring uniformity of image quality between galaxies in the manga survey ) .",
    "historical conditions at apo and experience during manga commissioning suggest that atmospheric conditions are generally stable enough that these criteria will not pose a serious limitation to survey operations . in practice",
    ", exposures also can often be rearranged between sets to optimize observing efficiency and minimize the need for patching of missing dither positions ( see discussion by yan et al . in prep ) , and further modifications to the baseline strategy will continue to be explored throughout the survey .",
    "although differential refraction considerations are the primary factor that sets the manga observing strategy , we also highlight a few additional considerations here that will impact the manga reconstructed image quality and must be accounted for in survey operations .",
    "just as differential refraction effects degrade the effective dithering pattern and contribute to non - uniform sampling of an astronomical source , so too does the dithering accuracy of the telescope . as described above in ",
    "[ harestrict.sec ] , @xmath10 from refractive sources will frequently be less than @xmath135 arcsec , and the individual telescope offsets must therefore be good to better than @xmath59 arcsec in order to not be the limiting factor governing the image sampling regularity for the majority of observations .",
    "indeed , it is particularly important to minimize the contribution of offsetting errors for cases with already - high @xmath10 from differential refraction as the compounded errors may easily make the difference between an acceptably- versus unacceptably - uniform set of exposures .",
    "based on observations performed at apo during manga commissioning , the dither offset error has a median of 0.063 arcsec , and is smaller than 0.1 arcsec in 76% of exposures . although the current dithering accuracy degrades to a median of 0.1 arcsec at altitudes higher than 80@xmath0 , work is ongoing to improve this performance ( see details in yan et al . in prep ) .",
    "in addition to the accuracy with which the telescope offsets are performed it is also important to consider the guiding accuracy of the telescope ( i.e. , how well a given position is maintained over the course of an exposure ) .",
    "although poor guiding performance will not degrade the coverage uniformity of a set of exposures , it will degrade the image quality of the exposures by contributing in quadrature to the effective astronomical seeing .",
    "observations obtained during manga commissioning show that the median guiding accuracy ( based on variations in guide star positions across all 15-second guider camera exposures during each 15-minute science exposure ; see details in yan et al . in prep ) is 0.12 arcsec , substantially smaller than the median sdss 2.5 m seeing of @xmath20 1 ( computed across all boss spectroscopy in 2012 ) .",
    "we note that a similar effect is caused by differential refraction ; just as changing refraction causes the effective location of a fiber to move between two exposures (  [ ar.field.sec ] ) , so too does it cause the effective location of a fiber on a given astronomical target to move _ during _ the exposure as well .",
    "however , for observations obtained using the strategy outlined in  [ strategy.sec ] above this effect is small . since differential motion of a fiber with respect to a fiducial position (",
    "i.e. , @xmath10 ) scales roughly linearly with time , the motion in a 15-minute exposure will be @xmath20 1/3 of that for a given set of 3 exposures .",
    "since we require the latter to be @xmath136 arcsec even in extreme cases , the motion in a single exposure will be @xmath102 arcsec , which is small compared to the guider accuracy and atmospheric seeing profile .",
    "the rotational position @xmath60 of the manga ifu bundles is controlled via clocking pins that ensure proper alignment of each ifu .",
    "however , mechanical tolerances of the pinhole translate to a rotational uncertainty for each bundle at the level of @xmath12 . in order to ensure that individual sets meet the @xmath121 arcsec coverage regularity goal at the edges of the largest fiber bundles ( @xmath137 arcsec radius ) we specify that the rotational offset @xmath138 required between any two exposures in a given set be @xmath139    generally , rotational tension in the ifu cables should ensure that @xmath60 remains relatively constant for a given plugging , and preliminary tests indicate that @xmath140 ( see law et al , in prep for further details ) .",
    "however , changes in the routing path of each ifu cable through the cartridge can lead to a different rotation ( and small translational offsets ) each time the plate is replugged , and we therefore require that sets be completed within a single plugging .",
    "rotation between sets of exposures can also degrade the reconstructed image quality if it is not measured and accounted for in the final astrometric solution . in figure [ bundlerot.fig ]",
    "we simulate the effect of stacking together two sets with different rotations without accounting for their rotational offset in the fiber astrometry .",
    "visible degradation of the reconstructed psf starts to become apparent at the edges of the ifu bundle once the sets are rotated from each other by @xmath12 , and distortions become severe once the rotation reaches @xmath141 ( i.e. , @xmath20 a fiber radius at the edge of the largest bundles ) .",
    "we therefore require that the manga data pipeline be able to measure the rotational clocking of each ifu at the level of @xmath142 so that it can be incorporated into the astrometric solution .      as discussed by law et al .",
    "( in prep ) and yan et al .",
    "( in prep ) , each manga exposure is flux calibrated independently to account for variations in the atmospheric seeing and transparency .",
    "adequate image reconstruction is therefore dependent on the relative accuracy of the flux calibration between exposures in a given set ; any offsets between exposures will hamper the ability of the dithered exposures to properly sample the source profile . the most pronounced effect of such offsets is not their degradation of the spatial profile of unresolved structures ( e.g. , point sources ) however , but rather their introduction of artificial spatial structure into a smooth background .",
    "we therefore simulate dithered observations of a constant surface - brightness source ( e.g. , like the outskirts of a smooth elliptical galaxy ) , assuming typical observing conditions with visual seeing @xmath36 arcsec .",
    "we mimic flux calibration errors by multiplying the fiber fluxes for each exposure by a scale factor drawn randomly from a gaussian distribution with a given rms width and a median of 1.0 before reconstructing the composite image .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ stippling.fig ] , calibration errors between individual exposures results in a stippling of the smooth background , introducing artificial spatial structure correlated with the dithered fiber pattern .    in a single set of 3 exposures",
    ", we find that rms flux calibration errors of 2% between exposures results in a reconstructed image whose surface brightness varies by 0.4% ( rms ) from pixel to pixel .",
    "this is comparable to the 0.3% pixel - to - pixel variations that we find in the reconstructed image assuming perfect flux calibration of all exposures .",
    "as flux calibration accuracy degrades further to 5% , 15% , and 50% rms between exposures , we find pixel - to - pixel variations of 1% , 2% , and 8% respectively in the reconstructed image .",
    "if flux calibration errors are uncorrelated between exposures in different sets , this variation will average out over the course of observations for a given plate . even in the case",
    "where individual exposures are calibrated as poorly as to within a factor of 2 , the pixel - to - pixel flux for a uniform background source varies by just 2% rms when averaged over 4 sets ( 12 total exposures ) .",
    "in contrast , preliminary results from manga commissioning data indicate that individual exposures are typically calibrated to within 2.5% ( yan et al . in prep ) , suggesting that flux calibration errors are unlikely to contribute significantly to the image reconstruction fidelity .",
    "the manga hardware design and observing strategy is driven by the desire to ensure high , uniform image quality and depth across all 10,000 of the galaxies that will be observed during sdss - iv .",
    "in particular , the goal of reaching 7% spectrophotometric accuracy between [ ]  @xmath143 and h@xmath38 @xmath144 requires that the reconstructed psf varies by 10% or less ( in both width and ellipticity ) across the face of each ifu .",
    "this goal is particularly challenging given the variable total number of exposures per field ( @xmath145 ) required to reach the target depth , chromatic differential refraction arising from the large wavelength coverage of the survey ( @xmath146  ) , and field differential refraction caused by the @xmath9 wide field of view over which individual ifus are deployed .      1 .",
    "each ifu fiber bundle should be constructed of a regular hexagonal grid of fibers to an accuracy of @xmath147  rms .",
    "the manga ifus meet and exceed this specification with a filling factor of 56% and a typical fiber placement accuracy of @xmath130  rms .",
    "2 .   exposures should be obtained in * sets * of three 15-minute exposures dithered to the vertices of an 1 equilateral triangle in order for each set to uniformly sample the image plane .",
    "3 .   the telescope must be able to dither to an accuracy of 0 or better .",
    "each plate should be observed for an integer number of sets until the combined depth reaches a signal - to - noise ratio of 5 @xmath4 fiber@xmath4 in the @xmath5-band continuum at a surface brightness of 23 ab arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "all three exposures in a set must be observed within one hour of each other ( i.e. , the change in hour angle between the start of the first exposure and the end of the last exposure should be one hour or less ) , and in a single plugging of a given plate .",
    "all three exposures in a set should have ( s / n)@xmath134 within a factor of two of each other , and be obtained in atmospheric seeing that varies by less than 0 .",
    "each set should be obtained in median seeing of 2 or better",
    "all manga exposures should be obtained in * visibility windows * @xmath148 hours in length corresponding to airmass @xmath149 .",
    "manga relative flux calibration between exposures must be good to @xmath150% or better .    in reality",
    ", many of the issues considered here will tend to average out over the course of the 3 - 4 sets that will typically be obtained on a given plate since effects that cause a slight gap in coverage for one set will often be filled in by another . however , our objective in designing the manga program is to ensure that the depth , coverage , and image quality of the entire survey is as good and * uniform * as possible for the entire wavelength range of each of our 10,000 galaxies . in forthcoming contributions ( law et al . in prep ,",
