    "transit observations have recently been obtained for giant planets orbiting stars other than the sun @xcite and there are plans for telescopes [ e.g. , tpfs ( terrestrial planet finders ) , jwst ( james webb space telescope ) , e - elt ( european extremely large telescope ) ] that will be capable of observing terrestrial planets around other stars .",
    "although the terrestrial planets around other stars likely have a broader range of characteristics than earth or the other terrestrial planets in our solar system , so far , earth is the only planet we know of that harbors life .",
    "therefore it is necessary to explore the full range of spectral signatures and variability which can be observed for earth , the only known life bearing planet , so that we can prepare for and understand the future observations of extrasolar terrestrial planets .    the atmospheric infrared sounder ( airs ) on - board the aqua spacecraft is an excellent tool with which to observe earth .",
    "the airs obtains 2,916,000 spectra of earth every day with 2378 infrared channels in the wavelength range from 3.75 @xmath1 to 15.4 @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and 4 visible near - infrared channels ( 0.410.44 @xmath1 ; 0.580.68 @xmath1 ; 0.710.92 @xmath3 ; 0.490.94 @xmath1 ) .",
    "the spacecraft has a polar sun synchronous orbit with a 1:30 pm ascending equator crossing time .",
    "the spectra are obtained as the airs scans across its path from @xmath0 @xmath449@xmath5 to @xmath649@xmath5 about nadir from an altitude of @xmath0 700 km .",
    "thus , it is able to observe the entire earth from space and provide a rich set of spectra consisting of day , night , land , ocean views at all latitudes .",
    "the radiometric calibration of airs has an uncertainty estimate of less than 0.2% in the mid - infrared and has been stable since launch @xcite .",
    "although future terrestrial planet finding telescopes must be designed so that they can characterize diverse types of terrestrial planets , figure  [ egypt ] shows that a relatively small region of earth can display a large diversity of spectral features in the visible and infrared .",
    "however , since the first generation of terrestrial planet characterization missions will not spatially resolve the surface features on the planets they observe , only one spectrum will be observed for the whole visible disk .",
    "this paper examines the observable mid - infrared spectroscopic properties and paper ii ( hearty et al .",
    "2008 ) examines the observable visible / near - infrared photometric properties .",
    "whole earth mid - infrared spectra have been directly obtained by the galileo satellite ( sagan et al .",
    "1993 ) and the mars global surveyor satellite with the tes instrument @xcite . however , the spectral resolution of these investigations was not sufficient for detailed analysis and they only viewed earth from a limited set of viewing geometries and seasons .",
    "`` earthshine '' spectra are able to observe seasonal and rotational variations @xcite , however , they are limited to the visible near - ir region of the spectrum and they can only view earth edge - on .",
    "we have used directly observed spectra of earth obtained with the airs to provide a detailed set of spectra to test existing models @xcite .",
    "although there is no reason to expect that we will observe a planet exactly like earth or at the same evolutionary stage as earth , the detailed spectra of earth obtained by airs allow us to explore all of the biomarkers that may be seen when tpf - like missions observe an earth - like planet orbiting another star .",
    "thus , our airs spectra can serve as a library of sample spectra from a life - bearing habitable planet .",
    "section  [ obs ] describes the airs observations we used and how we converted the observed radiances to whole earth spectra .",
    "we also compare a whole earth spectrum generated from airs to a tes / mgs observation of earth for a similar season and viewing geometry from 1996 .",
    "section  [ spectra ] describes the spectral signatures in the airs whole earth spectra and what signatures will be observable with future telescopes capable of observing extrasolar terrestrial planets .",
    "sections  [ rotational ] and  [ seasonal ] examine the rotational and seasonal variations that could be detected in observations of an earth - like extrasolar planet .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] summarizes our findings .",
    "we investigated one day of airs spectra from the 26th of each month from september 26 , 2004august 26 , 2005 using version 4 of the airs data products which are available from the goddard earth sciences data and information services center .",
    "we placed the airs radiances onto the healpix grid @xcite with nside = 32 ( 12,288 pixels covering the earth ) .",
    "the healpix grid is an equal area grid that allows us to simulate how the earth would look from different perspectives ( e.g. , edge - on and pole - on views ) and easily calculate disk averaged spectra .",
    "higher spatial resolution grids resulted in negligible differences in the disk averaged spectra .",
    "we produced grids to simulate ( 1 ) a `` cloud - free '' earth and ( 2 ) a `` fully cloud - covered '' earth using only clear or cloudy spectra culled from the full data set , and ( 3 ) a `` normal '' earth using all of the data .",
    "we selected the clear and cloudy spectra by examining the airs `` level 2 '' data that provides an effective cloud fraction ( * cldfrcstd * ) for each scene .",
    "we defined `` cloud - free '' observations as those with a cloud fraction @xmath7 0.05 and `` fully cloud - covered '' observations as those with a cloud fraction @xmath8 0.95 . because of the paucity of observations that satisfy the clear ( and cloudy ) cases we used 4 days of airs observations to fill - in the grid before interpolating over the missing data .",
    "figure  [ ir_day ] shows global maps of the gridded data for the clear , normal , and cloudy cases .",
    "the clouds tend to mask surface features in the infrared brightness temperature maps of earth .",
    "because version 4.0.9.0 of the airs processing software sometimes misidentifies clear scenes as cloudy over very warm land , the significance of the masking of surface features is underestimated for some regions ( e.g. , the sahara and australia ) .     of the earth at 3.8 @xmath9 m ( 2616 @xmath10 )",

    "specifically , we only included radiances for which the * calflag * parameter is 0 .",
    "figure  [ tescomparison ] shows a comparison with a spectrum of earth obtained with the tes instrument on the mars global surveyor to airs whole earth spectra constructed for a similar viewing geometry for clear , normal , and cloudy cases from november 2004 and a normal cloud cover case from november 2005 .",
    "the figure also includes a disc averaged spectrum calculated using a simple limb darkening parameterization adapted from @xcite where the limb adjusted radiance r(@xmath11 ) is calculated from the radiance at nadir r(0 ) as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13\\ ] ] and @xmath11 is the zenith angle .    the observed differences between the airs and tes spectra could be due to slight differences in the assumed viewing geometry , cloud cover , limb effects , or calibration .",
    "since there are differences between the airs spectra from november 2004 and november 2005 which have identical viewing geometries and calibration , we know that year - to - year spectral variations can be discerned .",
    "although the simple limb darkening model seems to bring the airs and tes spectra into better agreement the observations made by the two instruments are separated by more than 10 years , thus the differences could also be due to changes in the cloud cover which can also significantly affect the spectra .",
    "a more accurate treatment of the limb effects is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "moreover , since it is likely to be a small correction ( relative to the effects of clouds ) , we neglect limb effects for the rest of this paper .",
    "the mid - infrared observations with airs allow us to observe spectral signatures of habitability and life ( e.g. , h@xmath14o , co@xmath14 , ch@xmath15 , and an apparent temperature from the spectral shape ) .",
    "we used the 2004 hitran molecular transition line database to identify the spectral features from the airs data ( rothman et al . 2005 ) .",
    "figure  [ airsbroad ] shows that for clear and cloudy scenes the o@xmath16 line , an important sign of life can appear either in emission or absorption . since the earth contains regions that are clear and covered by dense clouds , the disk averaged airs spectra enable us to determine the limitations in characterizing the temperature of earth - like planets with clouds .",
    "this effect can be significant since the variation in the mid - infrared due to clouds is greater than the differences between day and night .",
    "figure  [ march_spec ] shows disk averaged broad - band mid - infrared spectra for fully illuminated and fully unilluminated views of earth on march 26 , 2005 for clear , normal , and cloud covered cases .",
    "the `` ocean view '' is centered above the pacific with @xmath0 10% of the projected area filled with land and the `` land view '' is centered above africa with @xmath0 40% of the projected area filled with land .",
    "the day night difference is larger over land than over ocean .",
    "we can also see from this figure that for an edge on view at opposition we will observe a larger radiance variation for a rotating planet with an uneven distribution of oceans and land ( like earth ) than we will observe at conjunction .",
    "figure  [ ocean_spec_zoom ] shows the fully illuminated and unilluminated earth spectra of the h@xmath14o , o@xmath16 , co@xmath14 , and ch@xmath15 spectral features and the ratio of the spectral feature in the daytime and the night time .",
    "the 14  @xmath9 m co@xmath14 feature is less sensitive to day night difference and varying cloud amounts than the 4 @xmath9 m co@xmath14 lines that include some reflected sunlight .",
    "however , the saturated line cores of o@xmath16 and co@xmath14 due to the warm stratosphere are similar for both the clear and cloudy cases . therefore ,",
    "if an earth - like extrasolar planet were completely covered by clouds we may still be able to detect o@xmath16 emission if the telescope has sufficient spectral resolution .    since the first generation of telescopes capable of directly detecting spectra of extrasolar terrestrial planets will likely not have the spectral resolution of airs many of the features seen in the spectra described in this paper may not be observable .",
    "the space - based nasa - terrestrial planet finder mission concepts ( tpf - o , tpf - c , tpf - i ) or the ground - based european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) are expected to image and characterize exoplanets down to super - earth and earth - size . in these cases ,",
    "the spectral resolution obtainable will be limited by the photon noise , so a reasonable estimate is a spectral resolution of @xmath0 50 for super - earths at 10 pc .",
    "higher spectral resolution spectra in the infrared , though , could be obtained with jwst for super - earths in the habitable zone of m stars using the secondary transit technique .",
