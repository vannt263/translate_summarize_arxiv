    "the calculation of gravitational radiation produced in the merger of two black holes is of considerable theoretical interest",
    ". it may also provide templates of wave - forms for analysis of ligo - virgo data . to be of practical interest to matched filtering , the calculational methods will have to recover many wave - periods over an extended parameter range , such as in the problem of binary black hole coalescence with a range of black hole masses and spins .",
    "it poses the challenge of efficient and stable phase - accurate numerical methods .",
    "it has been appreciated that this requires an inherently stable formulation of the dynamical evolution of spacetime .",
    "spectral methods provide the most efficient representation of functions that are periodic and everywhere analytic , and preserve accurate phase information in hyperbolic evolution .    here , we consider the 3 + 1 hamiltonian equations for the dynamical behavior of spacetime @xcite .",
    "they are attractive , in describing the evolution in terms of quantities that have unambiguous geometric interpretations .",
    "however , for arbitrary choices of gauge , they are known to give rise to computational instabilities , which have thusfar prevented their application to large - scale numerical relativity .    here , we propose a new gauge for time - evolution , which describes a correlation between the lapse function and the extrinsic curvature of the foliation of three - surfaces in spacetime .",
    "linearized stability analysis shows that the full system of hamiltonian equations now becomes hyperbolic with respect to arbitrary perturbations of the three - metric .",
    "next , we focus on black hole spacetimes which are asymptotically quiescent @xcite . this asymptotic property , if present in the initial data , is preserved for all time by causality in the equations of general relativity",
    ". it can be exploited by compactification in spherical coordinates with complex radius , @xmath3 with complex radius @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes a dimensional continuation parameter for a spacetime with total mass energy @xmath7 . here",
    ", @xmath8 can be chosen sufficiently large , i.e. , at least on the order of @xmath7 , to avoid singularities associated with black holes , even those that may carry spin . in this approach ,",
    "we focus on the _ outer _ expansion of the green s function .",
    "it makes possible a three - dimensional spectral representations after application of a mbius transformation ( which preserves conformally flat initial data ) .",
    "the combination of hyperbolic hamiltonian equations and spectral representations offers a novel starting point for studying the dynamical evolution of black hole spacetimes . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we consider the conformally flat initial data of schwarzschild black holes , as in the problem of a head - on collision of two black holes . here , conformally flat data are special , in representing turnings points corresponding to the up or down position of a pendulum .",
    "the proposed lapse function is natural choice about such turning points .",
    "to illustrate compactification by a mbius transformation , we explicitly identify newton s law in terms of the evolution of the quadrupole deformations in area of poloidal flux surfaces , given by the moment of inertia @xmath9 of spacetime .",
    "at large distances from the source region , the two wave - modes in the gravitational field appear as planar waves in the three - metric @xmath10 , commonly expressed in the transverse traceless gauge as @xmath11 @xmath12 denote the amplitude of @xmath13 and @xmath14 plane - waves along the @xmath15direction with wave - number @xmath16 .",
    "the three - dimensional ricci tensor associated with @xmath10 hereby assumes the following structure . for the @xmath13 waves with @xmath17 , we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and for the @xmath14 waves with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , we find , similarly , @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "hence , we have the following exact algebraic identities : @xmath27 where the numerical indices refer to normalized directions in the coordinate directions @xmath28 .    the identies ( [ eqn_id ] ) show that the two polarization modes satisfy traveling wave solutions @xmath29 in the large - distance approximation ( neglecting @xmath30 curvature terms , in this section ) with vanishing lapse functions @xmath31 and constant lapse function @xmath32 , satisfying @xmath33 where @xmath34 using the numerical indices to denote the normalized directions in @xmath35 ) .",
    "the angular directions  22 - 33 \" and  23 \" therefore represent the _ hyperbolic directions _ , which contain all wave - motion .",
    "we consider the 3 + 1 decomposition of the line - element in terms of @xmath10 @xcite @xmath36 the lapse and shift functions can be seen to define the motion of observers with velocity four - vector @xmath37 , for example , by considering their acceleration @xmath38 which is determined entirely by the redshift factor @xmath39 when @xmath40 . in general , the lapse and shift functions appear in the conservation of energy and momentum , of test particles moving along geodesics . we need not impose the time - symmetric gauge condition with @xmath41 .",
    "the three - metric @xmath10 satisfies the hamiltonian evolution equations @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes the gauged three - tensor @xmath45    we propose the time - evolution accoring to @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the gauge condition @xmath0 is _ curvature - driven evolution_. it is different from the product of curvature and lapse function in the harmonic slicing condition @xmath49 in eqs .",

    "we conclude that the system @xmath1 in ( [ eqn_k ] ) is asymptotically stable by virtue of the gauge choice @xmath0 .",

    "we have shown that the 3 + 1 hamiltonian equations become hyperbolic , when the evolution of the lapse function is driven by the extrinsic curvature tensor .",
