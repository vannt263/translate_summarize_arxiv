    ", there has been a lot of interest in the mathematics community to study the occupation time for various processes@xcite .",
    "recently the study of the occupation time has seen a revival in the physics community in the context of nonequilibrium systems@xcite due to its potential applications in a wide range of physical systems which include , amongst others , optical imaging@xcite , analysis of the morphology of growing surfaces@xcite and analysis of the fluorescence intermittency emitting from colloidal semiconductor dots@xcite .",
    "the occupation time @xmath0 is clearly a random variable .",
    "its probability distribution @xmath7 evidently depends on the window size @xmath8 .",
    "it turns out that quite generically there are essentially two types of asymptotic behaviors of this distribution @xmath7 depending on whether the underlying stochastic process @xmath1 is _ non - stationary _ or _ stationary_. a non - stationary process is one where the two - time correlation function @xmath9 depends on both times @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",

    "the analytical calculation of this scaling function @xmath23 is , however , nontrivial even for this simple brownian case . following the work of lvy",

    "for example , the scaling function @xmath23 has been computed exactly for the so called lvy processes@xcite , and recently for a more general class of renewal processes@xcite .",

    "recently the importance of studying the statistical properties such as the persistence and the distribution of the number of zeros of _ discrete stochastic sequences _ , as opposed to the more traditional _ continuous stochastic processes _ , has been emphasized in a number of articles@xcite .",

    "first , in various experiments and numerical simulations , even though the underlying physical process is continuous in time , in practice one actually measures the events only at discrete time points .",
    "the result of this discretization can lead to subtle and important differences between the ` true ' properties of the process and the ` measured ' properties@xcite . to estimate these differences , it is important to study the properties of a discrete sequence .",
    "the second reason follows from the observation@xcite that many processes in nature such as weather records are stationary under translations in time only by an integer multiple of a basic period .",
    "for example , the seasons repeat typically every one year . for such processes ,",
    "it was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the persistence of the underlying continuous process coincides with that of the discrete sequence obtained from the measurement of the process only at times that are integer multiples of the basic period .    in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite a specific discrete sequence was obtained as a limiting case of the diffusion equation on a hierarchical lattice .",
    "this rather simple _ toy _ sequence , even though non - markovian , had the remarkable property of being solvable for certain statistical properties such as the persistence@xcite and the distribution of the number of zeros@xcite .",
    "furthermore , these exact results were rather nontrivial@xcite even for this toy sequence .",
    "it is always important to have a such a solvable non - markovian toy model which can then be used as a benchmark to predict the possible expected behaviors of various observables in a more complex non - markovian process . in this paper",
    "we show that the occupation time distribution can also be computed exactly for this toy model and like other quantities such as the persistence , it is rather nontrivial even for this simple toy model .",
    "we further make an interesting observation that the occupation time for this toy sequence is related to a specific physical observable in an ising spin glass chain with nearest neighbor interactions . in a given sample of the spin glass chain",
    ", one can ask : what is the average ( thermal ) number of spins that are aligned to the direction of their local fields ?",
    "this physical object is a random variable that fluctuates from one sample of disorder to another .",
    "a natural question is : what is the probability distribution ( over disorder ) of this thermal average ?",
    "it turns out that this distribution is nontrivial even at infinite temperature .",
    "in fact , we show that at infinite temperature this distribution in the spin glass chain coincides exactly with the occupation time distribution of the toy sequence mentioned above .",
    "this connection is useful as it raises a general question for any spin glass model ( and not just restricted to a chain ) : what is the probability distribution of the average ( thermal ) number of spins that are aligned to their local fields ?",
    "in this paper , we show that the analytical computation of this distribution in the limit of infinite temperature , though still nontrivial , is tractable in few cases . in particular , we calculate analytically this infinite temperature distribution in the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model of mean field spin glasses@xcite .",

    "( [ hamil ] )",
    ". a spin configuration is called metastable if the energy required to flip any of the @xmath40 spins is strictly positive .",
    "in other words , all the spins must be aligned to their local fields in a metastable configuration .",
    "hence , for a fixed disorder , the fraction of metastable configurations ( out of the total number of @xmath272 spin configurations ) is given by , @xmath273 where @xmath274 s are the local fields .",

    "the average number of metastable configurations in the sk model was computed long ago by tanaka and edwards@xcite and also by bray and moore@xcite and this average is known to increase exponentially for large @xmath40 as @xmath280 where @xmath281@xcite . hence the average fraction scales as @xmath282 with @xmath283 .",

    "let us conclude this section with the following comment .",
    "in the case of the @xmath206-d toy sequence , we found in sec - ii that the full occupation time distribution @xmath51 and consequently the associated large deviation function is completely independent of the distribution @xmath34 . in the case of the sk model",
    ", we have derived the large devaition function for a specific form of the disorder distribution , namely the gaussian form .",
    "naturally the question arises as to how universal is this large deviation function as one changes the disorder distribution . evidently for finite",
    "n the results in the sk case , unlike the @xmath206-d case , will depend on the details of the distribution @xmath176 .",
    "however , due to the @xmath286 scaling in the definition of the distribution of the @xmath175 , the large @xmath40 results inculding the large deviation are universal ( upto rescaling by a constant factor ) , provided the variance of the @xmath175 s is finite . in the case of mean field spin glasses with power law or lvy interactions@xcite ,",
    "the variance of the @xmath175 is no longer finite and it would be interesting to study the occupation time distribution in this context .",
    "the three main points of this paper are : ( i ) we have been able to derive , for the first time , exact results for the occupation time distribution of a non - markovian process . in our case ,",
    "the stochastic process is not continuous in time , but rather a discrete toy sequence .",
    "nevertheless this toy sequence retains the non - markovian property which makes the results nontrivial .",
    "besides the fact that exact results are always useful and instructive , this toy sequence also appears in various physical contexts such as diffusion process and spin glasses , thus extending the range of applications of our results .",
    "( ii ) we also established an exact mapping of this sequence to an ising spin glass chain using a gauge transformation .",
    "the occupation time distribution in the sequence then translates , via this mapping , into the distribution of the thermally averaged number of spins that are aligned to their local fields in the spin glass chain at infinite temperature when all spin configurations are equally likely .",
    "this observation raises an interesting new question for any generic finite sized spin glass model : at a given temperature , what is the distribution of the thermally averaged number of locally aligned spins ?",
    "our exact results in one dimension show that this distribution remains nontrivial even at infinite temperature .",
    "( iii ) we then were able to compute analytically this infinite temperature distribution in the sk model of spin glasses with gaussian disorder and argued that for very large @xmath40 , the associated large deviation function is again universal , i.e. , independent of the precise form of the disorder distribution .",
    "we leave open the possibility of computing this distribution at a finite temperature for any spin glass model .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to know how this distribution changes as one goes below the spin glass transition temperature .",
    "the study of the number of metastable spins in various other spin glass models is an open question .",
    "we mention a few cases where exact results along these lines may be possible as the average number of metastable states is calculable : the sk model in the presence of external fields@xcite , p - spin spin glass models@xcite , spin glasses on random graphs@xcite , mean field spin glasses with lvy interactions@xcite , the hopfield neural network model @xcite and the random orthogonal model@xcite .",
    "the study of spin glass models on random graphs of fixed connectivity @xmath285 are of particular interest as they interpolate between the one dimensional toy model studied here , at @xmath287 , and the sk model in the limit @xmath288 .",
    "in this appendix we compute the variances of the occupation time both in the one dimensional toy sequence and in the sk model by a more direct method .",
    "these results are identical to those obtained from the limiting forms of the large deviation functions near @xmath60 .",
    "we have in general , @xmath290 \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { n\\over 4 } +   2 \\sum_{i < j } \\left ( \\langle \\theta(\\psi_i ) \\theta(\\psi_j ) \\rangle   - { 1\\over 4 } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   { n\\over 4 } +   { 1\\over 2 } \\sum_{i < j } \\langle { \\rm sgn}(\\psi_i )   { \\rm sgn}(\\psi_j)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have made use of the identities @xmath291 for all @xmath43 and @xmath292 .    in the one dimensional model only neighboring sites are correlated and hence one has @xmath293 where we have used the isotropy of the sites in the large @xmath40 limit .",
    "one now has that @xmath294 we introduce the function @xmath295 and use the relations @xmath296 and @xmath297 to carry out the integration and thus obtain @xmath298 putting this altogether gives the large @xmath40 asymptotic result @xmath167 .",
    "in fact using the generating function technique used in this paper , and hence taking into account the boundary terms exactly , one can show that @xmath299 for any @xmath40 .",
    "note that this result , for arbitrary @xmath40 , is independent of the precise form of the distribution @xmath34 .",
    "we now turn to the sk model where @xmath300 and the random variables @xmath201 s are independent and identically distributed with the gaussian distribution @xmath211 . clearly , one has @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",
    "we next use the well known identity that holds only for gaussian random variables , @xmath303 using this identity we get for @xmath304 , @xmath305 this yields @xmath306 which gives the result @xmath307 in the limit of large @xmath40 .",
    "we note that the result in eq .",
    "( [ skvar ] ) for finite @xmath40 is valid only when the distribution of the @xmath201 is gaussian .",
    "the finite @xmath40 result for arbitrary distribution of the @xmath201 will depend in general on the details of the distribution and hence , in contrary to what happens in the one dimensional toy model , will not be universal .",
    "however , as argued in sec .",
    "iv , the large @xmath40 results including the result for the variance , i.e. , @xmath308 is universal as long as the variance of the @xmath201 is finite .",
