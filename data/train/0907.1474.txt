    "the 2d fully - frustrated xy model ( ffxy ) has attracted the attention of several communities .",
    "indeed , antiferromagnets on a triangular lattice with a planar anisotropy enter in the class of ffxy models .",
    "the ffxy also describes the superconducting - to - normal phase transition in josephson - junction arrays in a perpendicular magnetic field for half a quantum of flux through each plaquette  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian @xmath2 where the sum extends over nearest neigbouring sites on the square lattice and @xmath3 are the lattice coordinates of the @xmath4-th site .",
    "this hamiltonian corresponds to the so - called _ pileup - domino _ ordering of the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic couplings .",
    "frustration arises from the existence of three ferromagnetic and one anti - ferromagnetic couplings in each plaquette .",
    "the phase diagram and critical properties of the ffxy has been subject of debate for the last three decades .",
    "it is now established that the system undergoes two phase transitions : a kosterlitz - thouless topological transition  @xcite associated to the breaking of the invariance under the global rotation of all spins ( @xmath5 symmetry group ) and a second - order phase transition between a paramagnetic phase and a low - temperature phase where chiralities of the spins around each plaquette are anti - ferromagnetically ordered .",
    "this second transition is associated to the breaking of a @xmath6 symmetry ( reversal of all chiralities ) like in the ising model .",
    "the existence of two phase transitions has been supported by many monte carlo simulations since the pioneering work of teitel and jayaprakash  @xcite .",
    "the same conclusion has been drawn for the @xmath7 xy model  @xcite .",
    "theoretical arguments also predict a disentanglement of @xmath5 and @xmath6 degrees of freedom . using a hubbard - stratonovich transformation ,",
    "choi and doniach showed the equivalence of the ffxy with two coupled o(2)-models  @xcite .",
    "the coupling is relevant under migdal - kadanoff renormalization and in the strong coupling limit , the model reduces to a ising - xy model ( the ising spin being related to the relative orientation of the two @xmath8-models ) .",
    "such a model have also been obtained by a mapping of the ffxy onto a 19-vertex model  @xcite .",
    "a modified version of the ffxy , introduced by villain , has allowed for the clarification of the nature of the topological defects causing the kosterlitz - thouless transition . by integrating out the spin - waves to leave only the contribution of the topological defects",
    ", this model reduces to a gas of charged particles ( @xmath9 ) in a uniform medium of charge @xmath10 interacting via a logarithmic coulomb potential  @xcite .",
    "+ a point of debate in the literature is whether the two phase transitions occur at the same temperature or at two very close ones .",
    "the breaking of the @xmath6-symmetry is associated to a second - order phase transition  @xcite caused by the proliferation of domain walls between domains of different antiferromagnetic orderings of the chirality . as predicted by korshunov  @xcite and then observed numerically  @xcite , at the kinks of these domain walls lies a @xmath9 topological defect and the formation of dipoles of two opposite charges @xmath11 and @xmath12 stabilizes the domain wall . as a consequence , the proliferation of these walls occur at higher temperatures .",
    "recent monte carlo simulations confirm that the two phase transitions occur at two distinct temperatures ( see @xcite and references therein ) . +",
    "another point of debate concerns the universality class of the second - order phase transition .",
    "since the broken symmetry is @xmath13 , this universality class may be the same as the 2d ising model .",
    "this idea is supported by the fact that the coupling in the ising - xy model has been shown to be irrelevant at the critical point  @xcite .",
    "however , most of the monte carlo simulations for the ffxy or the ising - xy model conclude that @xmath14 while @xmath15 for the ising model ( for a review of monte carlo estimations of the critical exponents , see table 1 of ref .",
    "the most recent monte carlo simulations  @xcite now show evidences in favor of the ising universality class .",
    "the disagreement with older simulations may be due to the fact that the exponents tend to the expected ising values only for large lattice sizes  @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we are interested in the out - of - equilibrium behavior of the ffxy . the short - time regime has been extensively studied  @xcite in the aim to determine the static critical exponents as well as the dynamical exponents @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the growth of the correlation length , both for the angles and the chiralities , has also been studied by numerical integration of the langevin equation  @xcite .",
    "temperature - dependent dynamical exponent were obtained for both angles and chiralities , in contradistinction to short - time dynamics simulations and relaxation of one - time quantities  @xcite for which @xmath16 remains close to @xmath18 . in the following , we present numerical evidences that both angles and chiralities display simple aging like homogeneous ferromagnets .",
    "this implies in particular that the dynamical exponent for the angles is @xmath19 for any temperature , like in the xy model .",
    "as usual in the context of aging , we study the two - time correlation and response functions from which we define a fluctuation - dissipation ratio measuring the degree of violation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "we consider two different protocols : in the first section , the system is prepared in one of its ground state and then let evolved below or at the kosterlitz - thouless temperature .",
    "the scaling of the two - time functions are compared to the xy model . in the second section",
    ", the system is prepared in the paramagnetic phase and then quenched at the kosterlitz - thouless temperature . in the third section ,",
    "the aging of the chirality is studied when the system is prepared initially in the paramagnetic phase and then quenched at the @xmath6 critical temperature .",
    "the system is initially prepared in one of its ground states ( figure [ fig0 ] ) and then let evolved in the critical phase , i.e. at @xmath20  @xcite , with the glauber dynamics  @xcite . if the coupling with the chirality can be neglected out - of - equilibrium , the thermal excitations associated to the angles are spin waves that should develop in the system in the very same way than in the xy model but with an effective coupling constant @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "previous monte carlo estimates of the dynamical exponents found to be close to @xmath19  @xcite ( denoted @xmath22 in this paper ) is compatible with this picture .",
    "the two - time spin - spin correlation function of the ffxy are thus expected to decay as in the xy model  @xcite @xmath23 in the spin - wave approximation .",
    "the first term is due to short - time reversible processes for which invariance under time translation is manifest in the dependence on @xmath24 only ( quasi - equilibrium regime ) .",
    "the second term is the contribution of long - time irreversible processes causing aging .",
    "it depends only on @xmath25 .",

    "the lattice size is @xmath33 and the data have been averaged over 12,000 histories .",
    "+ in a first step , we have interpolated the quasi - equilibrium regime @xmath34 to extract the static exponent @xmath0 . to eliminate the aging part",
    ", we analyzed the data along the curves @xmath35 on these curves , the correlation function @xmath36 decay as @xmath34 so that an estimation of @xmath0 is easily obtained by a linear fit of @xmath37 versus @xmath38 .",
    "practically , this was accomplished by first doing an interpolation of the correlation function in the plane @xmath39 between the simulation points . on figure  [ fig1 ] ,",
    "our estimates of @xmath40 are plotted versus @xmath41 .",
    "since we are considering the quasi - equilibrium regime , @xmath42 , the value of @xmath0 has to be measured in the regime of small @xmath43 and thus on the right of the figure .",
    "deviations , visible on the left part of the figure , are due to corrections to the dominant behavior of the correlation function . to test for the possible existence of transient regime at small @xmath31",
    ", we have also tried to remove the smallest waiting times : the different symbols on the figure correspond to effective exponents taking into account all waiting times ( circles ) , only waiting times @xmath44 ( squares ) , @xmath45 ( diamonds ) up to @xmath46 ( stars ) .",
    "even though the statistical errors increase when fewer waiting times @xmath31 are taken into account , all curves are nicely compatible .",
    "our final estimates of @xmath0 are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "they are in good agreement with other estimates found in the literature ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) , including static monte carlo simulations , and close at low temperature to the linear behavior @xmath47 predicted in the spin - wave approximation .",

    "since it is necessary to take into account correlation functions at well separated times @xmath31 and @xmath30 , the correlation function is very small and thus noisy .",
    "a precise determination of @xmath0 is more difficult than in the quasi - equilibrium regime . as a consequence",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to check that the previously estimated exponents @xmath0 are compatible with our data in the aging regime . to that purpose",
    ", we made a log - log interpolation of @xmath61 versus @xmath62 . to take into account possible corrections to the asymptotic behavior",
    ", we varied the interpolation window .",

    "however , as temperature increases , the width of this plateau shrinks .",
    "it could tempting to interpret the deviations from the plateau as the effect of corrections to the aging behavior @xmath66 .",
    "however , as can be seen on the right figure  [ fig3 ] , where the effective exponents are now plotted with respect to the smallest time @xmath30 entering into the fit , these deviations depend only on @xmath30 and occur for large values of @xmath30 .",
    "they are thus due to an under - sampling of the correlation at large times @xmath30 that induces large systematic fluctuations of the effective exponents when only the last few points enter into the interpolation .",
    "they are thus numerical and not physical .    in the case of a quench at the kosterlitz - thouless temperature @xmath67 ,",
    "the estimation of the exponent @xmath0 using the interpolation of @xmath68 in the quasi - equilibrium regime becomes much less accurate .",
    "we obtain an estimate @xmath69 .",
    "however , a nice collapse of the scaling function @xmath61 versus the scaling variable @xmath70 is observed as shown on figure [ fig4 ] and gives evidences of the validity of the expression ( [ eq1 ] ) up to the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature .",
    "the effective exponents do not present any plateau but only seem to tend towards the expected value .",

    "the following extended relation was introduced  @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 differs from the value @xmath78 out of equilibrium . in the aging regime ,",
    "@xmath77 is believed to tend towards a universal quantity , denoted @xmath79 .",
    "+ in the case of the ffxy model , the local order parameter is the two - dimensional vector @xmath80 . as a consequence , correlation and response functions are tensors : @xmath81 @xmath82 where the magnetic field is decomposed as @xmath83 . in the following",
    ", we will consider only the traces @xmath84 and @xmath85 corresponding to the usual expression of the correlation function : @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "this choice was already made in the study of the fluctuation - dissipation ratio in the xy model  @xcite .",

    "the response function is noisier than the correlation function and thus does not allow for a precise determination of @xmath0 .",
    "however , with a sufficiently large number of histories , the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath77 can be computed with a reasonable accuracy . using the scaling behavior for the correlation function ( [ eq1 ] ) and the response function ( [ eq6 ] ) in the spin - wave approximation",
    ", one can calculate the scaling behavior of the fluctuation - dissipation ratio : @xmath89 that displays a divergence for @xmath90 .",
    "such a divergence was already reported  @xcite for the xy model .",
    "we also observe a divergence of @xmath77 for the ffxy but its location tends to increase with the waiting time @xmath31 .",
    "unfortunately , the computation of the fluctuation - dissipation ratio is very cpu time - demanding and we had to restrict ourselves to a lattice size @xmath91 and a final time @xmath92 .",
    "the data have been averaged over @xmath93 histories at the two lowest temperatures and @xmath94 for the others .",
    "the waiting times are @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "as shown on figure [ fig6 ] , the location of the divergence @xmath97 displays a nice linear behavior with @xmath98 with a value at @xmath99 compatible with the predicted value @xmath100 .",
    "this provides an indirect confirmation of the scaling behavior ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "we now consider the following protocol : the system is prepared in a random state , i.e. at infinite temperature , and then quenched at the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature .",
    "as we will show , the dynamics of the ffxy shows aging in a way similar to the xy model . above the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature , the spin - wave approximation is not expected to hold anymore but we can assume , like in the xy model , that the two - time spin - spin correlation function @xmath36 decay as @xmath101 the prefactor @xmath34 corresponds to the quasi - equilibrium regime while the scaling function @xmath102 encodes the aging behavior of the correlation function . according to the aging hypothesis , the relevant scaling variable is @xmath103 where the characteristic length of domains is expected to grow as @xmath104 , i.e. algebraically ( infinite relaxation time ) with a logarithmic correction due to the pinning of the domain walls by the free vortices present in the paramagnetic phase  @xcite . in the case of the xy model , the dynamical exponent is @xmath19 . to test eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , we have performed monte carlo simulations for a lattice size @xmath33 with a final time @xmath105 .",
    "the data have been averaged over 5000 histories .",
    "the data are noisier than in the low - temperature and it is not possible to obtain a more accurate estimate of @xmath0 from the quasi - equilibrium regime . on figure [ fig8 ] ,",
    "the scaling function @xmath106 is plotted versus @xmath107 .",
    "the different curves correspond to waiting times @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the collapse of the different curves has been obtained using @xmath110 .",
    "we are left with an algebraic decay @xmath111 that confirms the scaling hypothesis ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "a close inspection of the effective exponents for the different waiting times reveals an evolution with @xmath31 . on the inset of fig [ fig8 ]",

    "the different curves correspond to the different waiting times @xmath31 .",
    "again , the large fluctuations for the leftmost points ( larger values of @xmath30 ) occur at the same value of @xmath30 , independently of the waiting time @xmath31 .",
    "we thus interpret them as due to an under - sampling of the correlation causing systematic deviations of the effective exponents when the number of points entering into the interpolation becomes small . as a consequence",

    "the exponents are plotted on figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "the extrapolation for @xmath114 leads to @xmath115 and thus , defining the autocorrelation exponent as  @xcite @xmath116 , we obtain @xmath117 .",
    "this value is slightly larger than the one obtained in the short - time regime from the initial - slip exponent @xmath17 ( @xmath118 )  @xcite .",
    "note that short - time dynamics is equivalent to our analysis with @xmath119  @xcite and is thus unable to give a correct estimate if the effective exponent evolves strongly with the waiting time @xmath31 .",

    "again the response is too noisy to investigate its asymptotic scaling behavior but , using smaller lattice sizes and final times , it is still possible to improve significantly the statistics and estimate accurately the fluctuation - dissipation ratio .",

    ", @xmath79 does not present any evolution with the waiting time @xmath31 .",
    "for comparison , we have performed a similar simulation for the pure xy model .",
    "the asymptotic fdr is estimated to be @xmath127 for the xy model , i.e. very different from our value for the ffxy .",
    "we have also investigated the dynamics of the chirality , denoted @xmath128 in the following . for each plaquette ,",

    "chirality is expected to behave as antiferromagnetically - coupled ising spins but a controversy exists regarding the belonging of the associated transition to the ising universality class . in the following ,",
    "we will compare two - time chirality - chirality correlation functions and the fdr associated to the response to a field coupled to the chirality with those of the ising model .",
    "the system is initially prepared in the paramagnetic phase and then quench at the @xmath6 critical temperature .",
    "we have considered two different estimates of the critical temperature : @xmath130  @xcite and @xmath131  @xcite .",
    "we have computed the two - time chirality - chirality correlation function @xmath132 for a lattice size @xmath33 up to the final time @xmath133 .",
    "data have been averaged over 5000 histories . during a quench at the critical temperature ,",
    "autocorrelation functions are expected to behave as @xmath134 where the first term corresponds to the quasi - equilibrium regime characterized by a critical exponent @xmath135 and the second one is the aging part depending only on the ratio @xmath103 . in the ffxy , we assume that the existence of free topological defects in the high - temperature induces logarithmic corrections in the growth law .",
    "thus the correlation length for the chirality - chirality correlations is expected to grow as @xmath136 , i.e. in the same way as for the spin - spin correlation functions . as a consequence ,",

    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows the collapse of the scaling function @xmath139 versus @xmath140 for different waiting times .",
    "this collapse is clearly destroyed when @xmath141 is chosen smaller than @xmath142 or larger than @xmath143 .",

    "this coupling is manifest in the fact that the fdr is affected by logarithmic corrections that may be interpreted as an influence of the topological defects causing the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "moreover , the fact that our estimate of @xmath79 for the chirality is relatively close to the value measured at the kosterlitz - thouless temperature for the angles may also be the result of a strong coupling . to reach the cross - over regime and eventually enter the true critical regime , the correlation length should be allowed to reach much larger values .",
