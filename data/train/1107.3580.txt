    "compact galaxy groups ( cgs ) occupy an interesting part of the parameter space that pertains to the clumping of matter in the universe . on the one hand",
    ", they lie at the low end tail of the distribution of membership size , as they contain few galaxies  typically three or four @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "their compactness places them on the high end of the number density distribution , similar to that in the centres of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "in addition , cgs display low velocity dispersions of @xmath0km@xmath1s@xmath2 @xcite , compared to galaxy cluster dispersions of @xmath3km@xmath1s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this dynamical situation lengthens interactions , when such events occur , or forces galaxies to a state of quasi - secular evolution : while they may not interact physically with their neighbours , they are always affected by them dynamically @xcite . in terms of galaxy evolution , they present potential precursors of isolated ellipticals .",
    "furthermore , they allow for close studies of galaxy evolution and morphological transformation , given their relatively few degrees of freedom ( as compared with galaxy clusters and their hundreds of members ) .",
    "the work presented here relates qualitative age dating of thousands of star clusters in seven hickson compact groups ( hcgs ) to the cg evolutionary diagram proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : evo ] ) .",
    "this draws upon results presented in an ongoing series of papers on individual groups @xcite , and on the collective properties of hcgs @xcite . in brief",
    ", the diagram classifies galaxy groups according to a gas richness criterion . with the basic assumption that hi represents the reservoir of gas available for further star formation ( star formation potential ) , @xcite uses the ratio of gas mass to dynamical mass ( total mass ) to split cgs into three types : i , ii , and iii , for gas - rich , intermediate and gas - poor",
    "this is then filtered through the spatial distribution of the hi gas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cf . ) , to give rise to a two - pronged diagram , shown in figure  [ fig : evo ] .",
    "one sequence maps cgs where the gas in contained wholly within the galaxies ; the other includes groups that have started to build an intra - group medium through the release of gas during interactions .",
    "we study star clusters in seven hickson cgs ( hcgs ) following the methodology presented in @xcite .",
    "this is refined by using more recent simple stellar population ( ssp ) models by @xcite .",
    "we compare the _",
    "hst_-acs @xmath4 ( f435w  f606w ) and @xmath5 ( f606w  f814w ) colours of the clusters to these ssp models and infer their ages .",
    "lacking photometric coverage in the @xmath6-band , we can not break the age - extinction degeneracy inherent in the @xmath7 baseline .",
    "we therefore compare cg cluster ages qualitatively .",
    "we are largely aided by the fact that cgs are deficient in hi gas @xcite : since neutral gas is related to dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this implies an overall low dust content for hcgs , thus allowing for a ` clearer ' , relatively unextinguished view of their cluster populations .",
    "in addition , we take advantage of the long bandpass of the f606w filter , which covers the h@xmath8 line , by synthesising a starburst99 @xcite ssp model that includes emission lines ( i.e. from h@xmath9 , [ oiii ] , h@xmath8 and [ nii ] ) . in the observations , an excess in @xmath10-band light",
    "is interpreted as nebular emission arising from the ionisation of residual gas from star formation around a young cluster .",
    "sources with such an excess are considered to be no older than 10  myr , a timescale appropriate for the dispersal of gas from the maturing generation of supernov .",
    "the colour plots of figure  [ fig : clusters ] summarise our results .",
    "groups of different evolutionary stage feature strikingly different cluster populations ( left ) . selecting according to",
    "the proposed evolutionary diagram of @xcite reveals a pattern ( right panel ) : the median cluster age relates well to the @xcite type , therefore echoing the evolutionary sequence among those three types , as described in @xcite .",
    "mag , in order to eliminate contamination from giant stars local to the host galaxies .",
    "furthermore , a selection based on psf - photometry ensures little or no contamination from foreground stars and background galaxies .",
    "the solid line plots a @xcite ssp model , while the dashed line represents a starburst99 model @xcite that includes the emission lines transmitted in the @xmath10 ( f606w ) band .",
    "thus , any source shifted to ` greener ' values is considered to be younger than 10  myr old , a timescale appropriate for the clearing of the natal gas of clusters from supernov .",
    "the evolutionary state of a group is closely linked with the cluster age distribution : star forming groups show a large concentration of ` nebular ' sources ( those bracketed by the dashed line ) and many bright , blue clusters ( ages less than a few hundred myr ) ; groups containing both star forming and evolved / quiescent galaxies show an even spread of nebular , young and old ( red ) sources ; while evolved groups , those containing mostly or entirely quiescent galaxies , show few clusters outside the tight , red globular cluster clump  centred around @xmath11 ( 0.8 , 1.1 ) .",
    "continuing along that line , the * right panel * selects groups along the proposed evolutionary sequence of @xcite , where hcgs  16 , 59 , and 42 represent classes i , ii , and iii , as defined in @xcite .",

    "next in the sequence , the intermediate type hcg  59 shows increased star formation in the current era , as compared to hcg  16 .",
    "this is likely due to recent interactions between its member galaxies , which have led to bursts of star formation across the group .",
    "this is supported by a plethora of observational evidence , to be presented in konstantopoulos  et  al .",

    "its cluster population mirrors that state , as it is heavily skewed toward old ages .",
    "we find no evidence of massive cluster formation over the past few gyr in this system and no nebular sources ",
    "i.e. no ongoing formation .",
    "we have used the optical colours , and therefore ages , of thousands of _ hst_-selected star clusters to infer the properties of their host galaxies , members of compact groups .",
    "we have linked the distribution of cluster colours to the evolutionary state of their hosts and provide evidence in favour of the evolutionary sequence for cgs proposed by @xcite .",
    "while the lack of @xmath6-band coverage prohibits precision age - dating , the dust deficiency of the cg environment facilitates the qualitative age - dating of clusters with @xmath7 only .",
