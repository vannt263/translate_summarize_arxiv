    "the collimation of hadrons in jets is a basic phenomenon of high energy collisions and its quantitative understanding is an important task for qcd .",
    "simple differential characteristics of a jet are their energy and multiplicity angular profiles .",
    "the collimation of energy and multiplicity in the jet follows from the dominance of gluon bremsstrahlung processes in the parton cascade evolution .",
    "whereas the former is more sensitive to the hard processes inside a jet the second one is sensitive to the soft parton emissions from the primary parton .    the characteristics of soft particle production , such as particle multiplicities , inclusive distributions and correlation functions , are derived in qcd in the double logarithmic approximation ( dla ) and the modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) ( for review , see @xcite ) , which takes into account the leading double logarithmic terms and the single logarithmic corrections .",
    "these azimuthally averaged quantities can be obtained from an evolution equation for the generating functional of the parton cascade .",
    "this equation provides also next - to - mlla ( nmlla ) corrections taking into account energy conservation of parton splittings with increased accuracy .",
    "the corresponding hadronic observables can be obtained using the concept of local parton hadron duality ( lphd ) @xcite , which has turned out a successful description of many hadronic phenomena ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the inclusive @xmath0-distribution of particles inside a sub - jet with respect to the jet axis has been computed at mlla accuracy in the limiting spectrum approximation  @xcite , _ i.e. _ assuming an infrared cutoff @xmath4 equal to @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) ( for a review , see also @xcite ) .",
    "mlla corrections , of relative magnitude @xmath7 , were shown to be quite substantial  @xcite .",
    "therefore , corrections of order @xmath8 , that is nmlla , have been incorporated in @xcite .",
    "another characteristic prediction of qcd is the asymptotic increase of the mean average particle multiplicity in a gluon jet over the quark jet by the ratio of color factors @xmath9 , which is also modified by the similar set of corrections @xmath2 @xcite . in particular , this analysis has been extended to multiparticle production inside sub - jets with a precise prescription of the jet axis , which has been , for both observables , identified with the direction of the energy flux @xcite .",
    "the starting point of this analysis is the mlla master equation for the _ generating functional _ ( gf ) @xmath10 of qcd jets @xcite , where @xmath11 is a certain probing function and @xmath12 , the four - momentum of the outgoing parton .",
    "together with the initial condition at threshold , the gf determines the jet properties at all energies . within this logic , the leading ( dla , @xmath2 ) and",
    "next - to - leading ( mlla , @xmath13 ) approximations are complete .",
    "the next terms ( nmlla , @xmath14 ) are not complete but they include an important contribution which takes into account energy conservation and an improved behavior near threshold .",
    "indeed , some results for such nmlla terms have been studied previously for global observables and have been found to better account for recoil effects and to drastically affect multi - particle production @xcite .",

    "weighting over the energy @xmath101 of particle ( h2 ) , this relation leads to the correlation between the particle ( h = h1 ) and the energy flux , which we identify with the jet axis ( see fig .  [",

    "thus , the correlation and the relative transverse momentum @xmath104 between ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) are replaced by the correlation , and transverse momentum of ( h1 ) with respect to the direction of the energy flux .",

    "indeed , since soft particles are less sensible to the energy balance , the correlation ( [ eq : f ] ) disappears for these particles , leading to the sequence of factorized terms written in ( [ eq : fdev ] ) .",

    "finally , the kt - distribution is determined with respect to the jet energy flow ( which includes a summation over secondary hadrons in energy - energy correlations ) . in experiments , instead , the jet axis is determined exclusively from all particles inside the jet .",
    "the question of the matching of these two definitions goes beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "the nmlla @xmath0-spectrum has also been calculated beyond the limiting spectrum , by plugging ( [ eq : mellinnmlla ] ) with @xmath138 into ( [ eq : lmin ] ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf - nmllalambda ] .",
    "however , the best description of cdf preliminary data is reached at the limiting spectrum , or at least for small values of @xmath166 , which is not too surprising since these inclusive measurements mostly involve pions .",

    "[ fig : cdf - nmllalambda ] is an observable worth to be measured , as this would provide an additional and independent check of the lphd hypothesis beyond the limiting spectrum .",

    "fortunately , it is likely to be the case at the lhc , where the alice  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments at the large hadron collider have good identification capabilities at not too large transverse momenta .      integrating ( [ eq : f ] ) over the energy fraction @xmath75 yields the corresponding sub - jet multiplicity @xmath168 of hadrons inside the angular range @xmath169 of the jet @xmath114 @xcite @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the number of hadrons ( partons at scale @xmath4 ) produced inside the sub - jet @xmath111 of total virtuality @xmath172 and @xmath173 . within the leading parton approximation",
    ", we expand the multiplicity @xmath174 in ( [ eq : nconv ] ) at @xmath119 . similarly to the logic applied in ( [ eq : expansion1 ] ) for the computation of the @xmath99distribution , we take the logarithmic dependence of the average multiplicity @xmath171 , such that for @xmath175 and @xmath176 , one obtains the average multiplicity @xmath177 of soft hadrons within the sub - jet of opening angle @xmath178 with respect to the energy flow @xmath179 where @xmath180 is written in ( [ eq : nghnmlla ] ) and @xmath181 is the average color current of partons forming the energy flux .",
    "we write the color current as @xmath182 where @xmath183 follow from ( [ eq : qgratio ] ) and ( [ eq : fk ] ) and corrections @xmath132 from the logarithmic derivatives of the average multiplicity ( [ eq : nghnmlla ] ) : @xmath184 the exact formul of @xmath181 are given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the gluon to the quark jet average multiplicity reads @xmath185 for this quantity , in the limit @xmath186 , the appropriate ratio ( [ eq : qgratio ] ) @xmath187 ) is recovered .",
    "next we study the consequences for the behavior of the ratio at full angles @xmath188 and for sub - jets at reduced angles @xmath102 .",

    "therefore , the mixing of quark and gluon jets reduces the multiplicity in the gluon jet and increases it in the quark jet at sufficiently high energies and the effect from intermediate processes in the new definition of multiplicity ratio amounts to about 20% at a reduced energy scale @xmath194 .",
    "we have studied a definition of the jet which arises from the 2-particle correlation .",
    "the jet axis corresponds to the energy weighted direction of particles in a given cone @xmath115 . in this way smaller angles ( or transverse momenta ) can be meaningfully determined .",
    "the new effect from 2-particle correlations is the appearance of the `` color current '' in the result , which reflects the possibility of intermediate quark - gluon processes .",
    "we then studied the consequences of this analysis on the measurement of differential ( @xmath104-distribution ) and global ( particle multiplicity ) observables , where we have added mlla and nmlla corrections to the known lo results @xcite .",
    "the single inclusive @xmath0-spectra is determined within this logic and the agreement between nmlla predictions and cdf data in @xmath15 collisions at the tevatron @xcite is impressive , indicating very small overall non - perturbative corrections and giving further support to lphd @xcite .",
    "the main for the ratio @xmath1 reflects the possibility of intermediate quark - gluon processes .",
    "this effect can be seen by the scale breaking between jets and sub - jets at the same scale @xmath195 but different energies @xmath22 and opening angles @xmath102 .",
    "typical effects are of the order of 20% .",
