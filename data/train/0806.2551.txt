    "the presence of the tachocline , a thin shear layer located at the interface between the radiative and convective regions of the sun , was established two decades ago ( christensen - dalsgaard & schou , 1988 ; kosovichev , 1988 ; brown _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; dziembowski _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) but its _ modus operandi _ still remains mysterious .",
    "anisotropic turbulent stresses associated with rotationally constrained eddies are thought to maintain the differential rotation profile observed within the convection zone : @xmath0 where for example at @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( schou _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; gough 2007 ) .",
    "however , as shown by spiegel & zahn ( 1992 ) ( sz92 hereafter ) , the mere reduction in the amplitude of these stresses naturally expected to occur across the radiative  convective interface ( at @xmath5 ) can not explain the transition to near - uniform rotation below .",
    "it was later argued by gough & mcintyre ( 1998 ) ( gm98 hereafter ) that only _ long - range _ stresses can explain the suppression of the rotational shear in the bulk of the radiative zone and in addition maintain the angular velocity of the interior ( observed to be @xmath6nhz ) close to that of the surface despite the global spin - down induced by magnetic - braking .",
    "two competing theories for these presumed long - range stresses have been investigated : purely hydrodynamic stresses in the form of gravity waves ( see the review by zahn , 2007 ) and hydromagnetic stresses ( see the review by garaud , 2007 ) .",
    "this paper focuses on the latter mechanism only , although the dynamical balance in the sun could arguably involve a combination of the two .",
    "it has long been known that even a very small primordial magnetic field embedded in the radiative zone could in principle impose uniform rotation ( ferraro , 1937 ; mestel , 1953 ; mestel & weiss , 1987 ) .",
    "ferraro s isorotation law , @xmath7 valid in the limit of negligible dissipation and for steady - state , axisymmetric flows , is usually stated as _ the angular velocity must be constant on magnetic field lines_. thus in its simplest form , ferraro s law predicts the possibility of uniform rotation for the radiative zone provided the magnetic field is entirely confined beneath the radiative  convective interface ( rdiger & kitchatinov 1997 ) . on the other hand , any field line directly connected with the convection zone promotes the propagation of the rotational shear into the radiative zone ( macgregor & charbonneau 1999 ) , inducing what will be referred to from here on as a `` differentially rotating ferraro state '' .",
    "hence , field confinement is the key to the existence of a tachocline .",
    "gm98 were the first to address the question of how the presumed primordial field could indeed be confined within the radiative zone , and proposed that meridional flows driven by coriolis forces in the convection zone and burrowing downward would interact nonlinearly with the underlying magnetic field lines , bending them towards the horizontal in the tachocline region , thus effectively suppressing direct radial alfvnic transport between the convection zone and the radiative zone .",
    "conveniently , the same meridional flows can also be held responsible for mixing light elements such as li and be between the convection zone and their respective nuclear - burning regions , reducing he settling ( elliott & gough , 1999 ) as well as providing weak but sufficient angular - momentum transport to adjust the mean rotation rates of the convective and radiative zones continuously throughout the spin - down phase .",
    "the seminal boundary - layer analysis of the dynamics of the tachocline presented by gm98 validated the plausibility of this theory , although many of their simplifying scaling assumptions remain to be confirmed through the direct numerical solution of the governing equations .",
    "this paper first briefly reviews existing work and then presents new results on the laminar tachocline dynamics according to gm98 .",
    "we begin by discussing past attempts at implementing their model numerically in section [ sec : prevfail ] . in particular , we argue that the failure of previous numerical studies in reproducing field confinement can be explained by the selection of inappropriate boundary conditions . a new numerical algorithm is then presented in section [ sec : model ] , and used in section [ sec : numexp ] to revisit the idea proposed by gm98 with much more success .",
    "we discuss future prospects in section [ sec : disconcl ] .",
    "gm98 argue that the radiative interior should be divided into three dynamically distinct zones including ( from the base of the convection zone downward ) ( 1 ) a more - or - less magnetic - free region in thermal - wind balance , well - ventilated by meridional flows originating from the convection zone , which can be thought of as the bulk of the tachocline , ( 2 ) a very thin magnetic advection - diffusion layer where the tachocline flows and the underlying field interact nonlinearly to confine one another and ( 3 ) a magnetically dominated , near - uniformly rotating interior .",
    "the nonlinear nature and geometric complexity of the problem precludes analytical solutions , and all existing studies since the original work of gm98 have been numerical ( see the review by garaud , 2007 ) . among these , only two include all the nonlinear terms required ( i.e. the advection terms in the momentum and the magnetic induction equations , and the lorentz force in the momentum equation ) to represent the nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics of the tachocline `` correctly '' : garaud ( 2002 )  hereafter paper i  and brun & zahn ( 2006 )  hereafter bz06 .",
    "surprisingly , neither have been able to find evidence for the kind of dynamical balance proposed by gm98 , and the time is therefore ripe to take a step back and discuss why .",
    "paper i and bz06 are two studies which model magnetohydrodynamic perturbations induced in the solar radiative zone by the differentially rotating convection zone and by an assumed primordial magnetic field .",
    "both papers focus on the issues of field confinement and the suppression of differential rotation below the tachocline .",
    "paper i presents steady - state , axially symmetric solutions of an incompressible and unstratified version of the gm98 model .",
    "bz06 on the other hand use a time - dependent , three - dimensional algorithm based on the ash code ( glatzmaier 1984 ; clune _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; miesch _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ; brun _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) , and solve the complete set of anelastic mhd equations .",
    "both studies otherwise consider a similar computational domain , namely a spherical shell which spans the region between the base of the convection zone ( at @xmath8 ) and an inner sphere ( at @xmath9 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions are also essentially similar : the `` outer '' boundary , which effectively models the radiative  convective interface , is in both cases assumed to be impermeable and rotating differentially with an angular velocity profile given by equation ( [ eq : ocz ] ) ; the magnetic field is matched onto a potential field .    in paper",
    "i , the numerical solutions only show confinement of the magnetic field lines in the equatorial regions for low enough diffusivities , occasionally at mid - latitudes for lower field strength , but never in the polar regions ( see figure 11 of paper i for example ) .",
    "it is commonly argued that the failure of paper i to find fully - confined magnetic field solutions stems entirely from the simplified nature of the model equations ( incompressible , unstratified ) : indeed , within these assumptions the meridional flows are generated only by ekman - hartmann pumping on the boundaries , and their amplitude scales with the diffusivities in a way which always maintains the magnetic reynolds number below unity . as a result , these flows are unable to confine the magnetic field and the differential rotation imposed at the upper boundary of the domain persists within a large part of the radiative zone .",
    "the three - dimensional , time - dependent solutions of bz06 naturally depend on the initial magnetic field configuration selected .",
    "various cases with an initial field more - or - less deeply confined are discussed . against expectations , bz06 find that regardless of the initial conditions , the field lines always spread out and eventually overlap with the convection zone , permitting the propagation of the differential rotation into the radiative interior .",
    "interestingly , the transient state of the system  prior to any field line connecting with the convection zone  qualitatively looks in many ways similar to the well - known gm98 picture , although it is clearly not a steady state .",
    "the `` tachocline '' thus formed slowly narrows with time until field lines spread into the convection zone , at which point a differentially rotating ferraro state is rapidly established .",
    "one is forced to conclude in one of three ways : ( 1 ) for unspecified primordial reasons , the initial magnetic field was more deeply embedded in the radiative zone and the currently observed tachocline is merely a transient phase ; ( 2 ) the tachocline is indeed in a steady - state and some of the assumptions made in the way have been wrong ; ( 3 ) the parameter regime studied by bz06 ( where diffusion coefficients are artificially increased by many orders of magnitude to satisfy numerical constraints ) does not appropriately reproduce the solar interior dynamics .",
    "one should be uncomfortable in selecting the first option , as it would place very strong and unlikely constraints on the initial field conditions to provide just the right structure for today s tachocline .",
    "one could naively tend to favour the third option , but bz06 _ a priori _ took care to select a range of parameters for which all expected boundary layer thicknesses are small enough and in the same hierarchical order as those of the model proposed by gm98 .",
    "the plot thickens while we are left with the uneasy task of reconsidering the key features of either the numerical models or of the gm98 model ( both , perhaps ) .",
    "at this point it is worth discussing one of the more delicate aspects of the gm98 model , namely the exact mechanism by which these pivotal meridional flows are thought to be generated .",
    "this point has been a source of confusion and debate , but is clearly crucial to a better understanding of the tachocline dynamics . in the original work of gm98",
    ", the principal clue to the nature of the flows can be found in the sentence : _ `` turbulent stresses in the convection zone induce ( through coriolis effects ) a meridional circulation , causing the gas from the convection zone to burrow downwards ... ' ' _ .",
    "the flows considered by gm98 do not originate from within the tachocline and can therefore not be appropriately modelled by a numerical scheme in which the radiative  convective interface is assumed to be impermeable ( as in paper i and bz06 ) . while this conclusion seems obvious in hindsight , the physics of the problem are actually rather subtle and deserve clarification . in what follows",
    ", we discuss the issue in more detail and present a unified view of the results of previous works on the subject .",
    "spiegel & zahn were the first to study the dynamics of the newly - discovered tachocline ( sz92 ) .",
    "they considered a non - magnetic radiative zone only , and imposed a latitudinally - varying rotation profile at the radiative  convective interface .",
    "they performed two distinct calculations .",
    "the first looked at the time - dependent evolution of the angular velocity profile in the radiative zone under such forcing , assuming isotropic viscous stresses .",
    "the second sought steady - state `` tachocline '' solutions assuming anisotropic turbulent stresses . since the latter did not specifically address the question of the meridional flows , we focus here on the results of the time - dependent calculation , which can be interpreted in the following way .",
    "the differential rotation imposed by the convection zone to the top of the radiative zone inevitably induces some degree of shear along the rotation axis if the radiative zone is originally in a state of uniform rotation .",
    "this generates a thermal gradient in the latitudinal direction by way of the thermal - wind equation ( see gm98 , equation ( 1 ) for example ) .",
    "meridional flows are then required to balance this thermal gradient when the system is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "these flows burrow into the radiative zone , advecting angular momentum thereby helping the propagation of the shear further down .",
    "the results of sz92 imply that the system continues evolving in this fashion until the radiative zone has achieved complete thermal and dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the characteristic amplitude of the time - dependent flows associated with this thermo - dynamical relaxation process is , by way of the assumptions listed above , only dependent on the ( evolving ) local differential rotation , stratification and thermal conductivity .",
    "their turnover timescale is calculated to be of the order of the local eddington - sweet timescale , which is short in the initial relaxation stages and steadily increases as the system evolves .",
    "crucially , this result was derived independently of any boundary condition on the meridional flows .",
    "it is therefore correct to think of the induced transient flows as being driven by baroclinic stresses from _ within _ the tachocline rather than downwelling from the convection zone .",
    "in fact , they exist _ even if _ the radiative  convective interface is assumed to be impermeable .",
    "this fact is probably at the origin of the impermeable boundary conditions selected by paper i and by bz06 , in spite the obvious contradiction with gm98 s intent .",
    "however , it is vital to remember that this transient phase and its associated flows both end once the system achieves thermal and dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the only flows remaining in the final steady - state are driven , within tiny boundary layers , by the thermo(-magneto)-viscous stresses required to match the bulk equilibrium solutions to the applied boundary conditions .",
    "thus , as expected from any elliptic problem , the nature of the boundary conditions selected entirely controls the steady - state solutions .",
    "this is clearly illustrated by the work of garaud & brummell ( 2008 ) ( gb08 hereafter ) , which complements that of sz92 by calculating the spatial properties as well as characteristic amplitudes of _ steady - state _ meridional flows in the radiative zone , as induced by various kinds of forcing applied at the radiative  convective interface .",
    "gb08 showed that in the non - magnetic case , the induced steady - state flows can always be viewed  at least in the linear sense , and for solar parameters  as the sum of two `` modes '' : a viscously - dominated `` ekman mode '' , which very rapidly decays away from the interface ( on an ekman lengthscale ) , and a `` thermo - viscous mode '' which can essentially span the entire radiative zone when not hindered by a magnetic field .",
    "since the ekman mode decays too rapidly to have any effect on the tachocline dynamics , the flows discussed by gm98 , which are thought to ventilate the bulk of the tachocline , should be identified with the thermo - viscous mode .",
    "this view is perfectly consistent with gm98 s analysis , since the thermo - viscous mode is in thermal - wind balance ( gb08 ) .    the respective amplitudes with which the ekman and thermo - viscous modes are driven depend on the nature , amplitude and spatial structure of the forcing .",
    "gb08 showed that when the interface is impermeable , as assumed in paper i and by bz06 , then the amplitude of the thermo - viscous mode is negligible for microscopic solar values of the diffusivities . as a result ,",
    "the magnetic reynolds number of these tachocline flows is much smaller than unity , which straightforwardly explains why field confinement eluded these two previous studies .",
    "when flows are pumped directly through the interface by stresses within the convection zone ( i.e. the radial component of the flows is non - zero at the radiative  convective interface ) , gb08 find that the amplitude of the thermo - viscous mode can be much higher , in which case the tachocline flows may be expected to confine the field in a scenario qualitatively similar to the one proposed by gm98 .",
    "the quantitative detailed analysis must be done numerically ; this is the purpose of the present study .",
    "we now revisit the idea proposed by gm98 in the light of the previous discussion .",
    "a new numerical algorithm has been constructed specifically for this purpose .",
    "we first present , for the sake of completeness , a derivation of our model equations in section [ subsec : numeqs ] . since our computational domain",
    "is limited to a spherical shell within the radiative zone , we then present and discuss in detail all the boundary conditions applied in section [ subsec : numbcs ] . the relevant non - dimensional parameters , and expected boundary layers of the problem are discussed in section [ subsec : bls ] .",
    "the numerical method , as well as other numerical constraints , are finally outlined in section [ subsec : numalgo ] .",
    "the standard solar model ( ssm hereafter ) provides an accurate representation of the thermal structure and composition of the interior of a hypothetical spherically symmetric , non - rotating , non - magnetic sun .",
    "the excellent match between the ssm and helioseismic observations confirms that the likely internal dynamics of the sun only induce weak deviations in the background state thermodynamical quantities .",
    "the large - scale magnetohydrodynamics of the solar interior , thought to be responsible for the maintenance of the peculiar observed rotation profile , can therefore be thought of as perturbations upon the ssm .",
    "the quasi - steady ssm equations ( which are valid on timescales much shorter than the nuclear burning timescale ) reduce to the following set of four equations within the solar radiative zone ( but outside of the nuclear burning core ) : @xmath10 these equations describe hydrostatic equilibrium , thermal equilibrium , the equation of state and finally the poisson equation for the gravitational potential respectively . here , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the standard thermodynamical variables , @xmath14 is the thermal conductivity ( which typically depends on @xmath12 and @xmath11 ) , @xmath15 is the gravitational constant and @xmath16 is the gravitational potential .",
    "the equation of state itself is well - approximated by that of a perfect gas in this region of the sun .",
    "the solution to the set of equations ( [ eq : backg ] ) for the present - day sun can be inferred from model s of christensen - dalsgaard _ et al . _",
    "( 1991 ) for example ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we then consider perturbations on this background equilibrium caused by meridional and azimuthal flows , as well as magnetic fields . for simplicity , we restrict our study to axisymmetric systems .",
    "moreover , since the observed internal rotation profile of the sun has remained approximately constant over the past decade , we boldly postulate that the sun is in fact in a state of quasi - steady dynamical and thermal balance .",
    "the general set of equations governing the axisymmetric , quasi - steady perturbations are then @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents the axisymmetric flow velocity , @xmath19 the magnetic field and @xmath20 is the electric current , @xmath21 is the viscous stress tensor , @xmath22 is the specific entropy and @xmath23 is the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "these equations respectively characterise the conservation of momentum , mass , and thermal energy , the equation of state and the poisson equation , conservation of magnetic flux and finally , the solenoidal condition .",
    "thermodynamical perturbations are from here on denoted with tildes , as for example in @xmath24 .",
    "the system of equations ( [ eq : global ] ) can be linearised in the thermodynamical quantities around the background state equations ( [ eq : backg ] ) to yield @xmath25 where we approximated the equation of state with that of a perfect gas , and neglected perturbations to the chemical composition .",
    "note that the latter approximation was chosen for the sake of simplicity : wood & mcintyre ( 2007 ) showed that the effects of compositional gradients ( notably helium ) could play an important role in the tachocline dynamics .",
    "the background magnetic diffusivity @xmath26 , kinematic viscosity @xmath27 and thermal conductivity @xmath28 are calculated from model s using the expressions provided by gough ( 2007 ) ( see appendix a ) .",
    "note that the nonlinearities in the quantities relating to the magnetohydrodynamics of the interior ( flow velocities and magnetic field ) have not yet been tampered with .",
    "this term is included in the numerical algorithm for the sake of completeness , but in practise has little influence on the result ( at least in the case of the solar radiative zone ) .",
    "it will not be discussed in this paper for the sake of simplicity . ] .",
    "the next step is to use a spherical coordinate system ( @xmath29 ) and move to a rotating frame of reference , by considering that @xmath30 , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath33 adopted is uniquely defined by requiring that the total angular momentum of the convection zone be null in the rotating frame ( gilman _ et al .",
    "_ , 1989 ) : if @xmath34 is assumed to be independent of radius , and given by equation ( [ eq : ocz ] ) , then @xmath35 the equation for the conservation of momentum then becomes @xmath36 while the assumption of axial symmetry implies that the equations for the conservations of mass , thermal energy and magnetic flux are merely changed by replacing @xmath18 with @xmath37 .",
    "it is well known that the baroclinic deformation of the background state caused by the centrifugal force drives meridional flows , albeit very slow ones since the sun is a slow rotator ( eddington , 1925 ; sweet , 1950 ) . since the global turnover timescale of this eddington - sweet circulation",
    "is calculated to be orders of magnitude longer than the age of the sun , it can not play any role in the angular momentum or chemical mixing processes . in a steady - state calculation , however , these flows play an artificially important role and it is important to suppress them . this can be done by using the following momentum conservation equation instead ( sz92 ) : @xmath38 where cowling s approximation was also used to justify neglecting the perturbation of the gravitational potential related to density and temperature perturbations caused by the remaining coriolis and lorentz forces .",
    "finally , we assume that the meridional flow velocities remain small ( sz92 ; gm98 ) : we neglect quadratic terms in @xmath39 and @xmath40 , but retain nonlinearities in @xmath41 to allow for significant differential rotation .",
    "to summarise , the model equations we consider are @xmath42 where the quantities solved for are the three components of @xmath37 ( as defined above ) , the three components of @xmath43 , and the three thermodynamical variables @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and where quadratic terms in @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are neglected ( see appendix b for the full set of equations expanded in a spherical coordinate system ) .",
    "this set of equations is equivalent to the one used by gm98 before they apply their boundary - layer analysis .",
    "it also reduces to the one used by sz92 in the non - magnetic case , provided the following further approximations are applied : the boussinesq approximation , assuming that @xmath50 and that @xmath51 . finally , it is a steady - state and axisymmetric version of the equations used by bz06 .    for comparison ,",
    "note that rdiger & kitchatinov ( 1997 ) , macgregor & charbonneau ( 1999 ) , and kitchatinov & rdiger ( 2006 ) neglect meridional flows entirely in their calculations of the structure of the radiative interior sule , arlt & rdiger ( 2005 ) include meridional flows but assume that the poloidal field is fixed , so that the interaction between the field and the flows through the lorentz force in their paper is fundamentally linear ( and therefore inappropriate ) .",

    "the lower boundary is at @xmath53 as in bz06 .",
    "the inner core ( for @xmath54 ) can be viewed as a solid metallic sphere , within which a permanent magnetic dipole is maintained .",
    "the selection of the position of the lower boundary was found to have little influence on the tachocline dynamics for low enough values of the diffusivities .",
    "the selection of adequate boundary conditions for this model is a very delicate task .",

    "our aim is to propose a set of boundary conditions at the upper boundary of the computational domain which reproduces most faithfully the influence of the convection zone on the radiative zone , while those near the lower boundary are selected in such a way as to impose the required dipolar field , but otherwise be as inconspicuous as possible .",

    ", gb08 showed that the characteristic lengthscales of the dynamics of the radiative zone ( for solar parameter values ) can be summarised as @xmath129 ( i.e. the entire interior ) , @xmath130 ( i.e. @xmath131 ) and @xmath132 .",
    "hence , to retain the same ordering of lengthscales as in the sun ( @xmath133 ) , the factor @xmath134 must not drop below 1/3 , placing very strong constraints on the prandtl number used in the simulations ( i.e. pr should not exceed @xmath13510pr@xmath136 ) .",
    "the typical magnetic boundary layers are reviewed by acheson & hide ( 1973 ) . in the case of a magnetic field parallel to the boundary considered , the nature of the boundary layer depends on the respective sizes of @xmath137 and h : if @xmath138 h then the boundary layer thickness is of the order of h@xmath139 , while if @xmath140 then the boundary layer thickness scales as @xmath141 ( i.e. the boundary layer is actually of ekman type ) .",
    "we conclude that for realistic field strengths , the boundary layers in the horizontal field case ( e.g. near the equator ) will always be of ekman type .",
    "when the magnetic field is oblique , the situation changes : the ekman regime is recovered when @xmath142 , while the boundary layer has a magnetic nature when @xmath143 , in which case its thickness is of the order of h@xmath109 . we therefore conclude that unless the magnetic field strength ( in the tachocline ) has amplitudes lower than a mg , one may actually expect a hartmann layer near the radiative  convective interface .    to guarantee that @xmath144 in the simulations we need @xmath145 if the magnetic field is indeed of the order of 1 g as suggested by gm98 .",
    "this is clearly not an achievable goal , so we must inflate the magnetic field strength artificially to be of the order of 1 t near the outer boundary ; in that case the constraint on @xmath103 is much less stringent , with @xmath146 .",
    "finally , if we rely on flows downwelling from the convection zone to confine the magnetic field , then the amplitude of the flows assumed at the radiative  convective interface must be large enough for their magnetic reynolds number @xmath147 to be larger than unity .",
    "since @xmath147 is very loosely defined as @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the typical amplitude of the radial flows and @xmath150 is the observed thickness of the tachocline ( both in cgs units ) , then equation ( [ eq : rm ] ) implies that we need a priori flows with amplitude of the order of @xmath151cm / s to have a magnetic reynolds number of order one . for values of @xmath152 (",
    "typically achieved in the simulations ) , this naturally requires unphysically large flow amplitudes .",
    "the consequences of this choice are discussed in sections [ subsec : explor ] and [ sec : disconcl ] .        the numerical method selected for the solution of this elliptic system",
    "is based on the expansion of the governing equations and boundary conditions upon a truncated set of orthogonal functions spanning the @xmath153direction ( chebishev polynomials to be precise ) , followed by the solution of the associated set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) in the @xmath154-direction using a second - order newton - raphson - kantorovich ( nrk ) relaxation algorithm .",
    "the numerical algorithm is globally similar to the one used by garaud ( 2001 ) and in paper i , and is summarised in appendix c. the high latitudinal resolution required to capture the detailed structure of the interior dynamics demands a high - order expansion in @xmath155 .",
    "this in turn requires a sophisticated parallelized version of nrk an outline of relax  the parallel nrk algorithm freely available upon request to p. garaud  is given in appendix d ( see also garaud & garaud , 2007 ) .",
    "the complexity of the full set of equations ( [ eq : global2 ] ) precludes the derivation of analytical solutions in the general case , and hence direct tests of the full numerical algorithm .",
    "however , we have extensively and successfully tested the code through direct comparisons of the numerical solutions with analytical solutions of selected _ subsets _ of the system : paper i tested the un - stratified magnetic version of the code , while gb08 tested the stratified non - magnetic version of the code .      in the nrk / relax algorithm ,",
    "a guess is required for the solution of the ode system , and refined by successive iterations until the desired accuracy is reached .",
    "the convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed and immediate for linear systems regardless of the initial guess , but requires more accurate initial guesses for increasingly dominant nonlinearities . as a result",
    ", solutions are found in practise , first for high - values of the diffusivities ( i.e. high @xmath156 ) and with a low number of latitudinal modes , and then progressively followed into the nonlinear regime by lowering @xmath156 and increasing the number of modes .",
    "convergence of the solutions usually becomes painfully difficult as @xmath156 is lowered below a certain threshold .",
    "the causes of the problem can be varied : in some cases , the nonlinearities begin to dominate the solution and bifurcations occur which reduce the basin of attraction of the solution followed ; in others , the spatial structure of the solution becomes finer and finer , requiring more latitudinal modes and more radial meshpoints to be fully resolved .    the only way to address the first problem is to follow the solution carefully , and reduce @xmath156 only by a very small fraction between each run .",
    "this has the disadvantage of being a frustratingly slow process , with little to be gained in practise . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the likely change of stability of the solution tracked ( suggested by the change in convergence properties ) is an interesting dynamical information in itself ( see section [ subsubsec : algoselec ] ) .    to address",
    "the second problem typically requires increasing the number of modes and meshpoints , which leads to a very rapid increase in computational costs .",
    "nonetheless , some acceptable trade - offs are found with typical simulations using a few thousand meshpoints ( mostly concentrated in the boundary layers ) and about 60 - 100 latitudinal modes .",
    "these require no more than a few hours per iteration on about @xmath157-@xmath158 processors ( see appendix d ) .      at this point",
    "it may be worth discussing an oft - raised question about the selection of this specific numerical method of solution , as an alternative to the time - dependent ash code used by bz06 .",
    "both methods , when taken individually , are equally useful tools for studying the problem , each with their own advantages and limitations",
    ".    for example , the algorithm of bz06 studies the general properties of the radiative zone under the forcing considered , and in addition provides information on the stability of the system , naturally taking into account transport by smaller - scale three - dimensional flows when necessary .",
    "however , the very lengthy integration time required implies that only very few different parameter values can realistically be explored .",
    "moreover , the time - dependent nature of the algorithm makes it more difficult to identify quasi - steady states ( in particular when the typical timescales in the numerical model are far less obviously separated than in the sun ) .",
    "by contrast , the simplified axisymmetric and steady - state nature of the equations solved in paper i and here implies that each solution can be found in at most a day of real - time computations ( more typically an hour ) . as a result",
    ", we are able to explore a wide range of parameters and study in detail the behaviour of the solutions as a function of the imposed forcing ( boundary flows , differential rotation , magnetic field strength , ... ) and as a function of the background model ( diffusivities , thermo - dynamical profile , ... ) .",
    "this feature is invaluable when trying to understand how solutions scale with the various parameters ",
    "see gb08 for example .",
    "in addition , we always know that the solutions found are indeed the steady - state solutions of the system , and not transients . on the other hand , taking into account transport by three - dimensional turbulence is not possible ( without artificial parameterization of its effects ) .",
    "in addition , we can not _ a priori _ know whether the steady - states found are stable , or whether they may be unstable to either 2d or 3d perturbations .",
    "interestingly , however , we can make use of the fact that the emergence of unstable solutions implies a reduction of the basin of attraction of the stable ones ( see section [ subsubsec : convsol ] ) , and ( tentatively ) identify sudden convergence difficulties with the presence of a bifurcation . for example , the simulations of bz06 can be compared with ours for @xmath159 ( see section [ subsec : bz ] ) .",
    "our numerical algorithm has little difficulty converging to a solution for parameters @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath108 respectively about 2 times larger than the ones quoted above . to go from there down to the values used by bz06 on the other hand requires much more care , a problem which is very likely related to the fact that the bz06 solution is seen to be mildly unstable to 2d and 3d perturbations .",
    "the versatility of the numerical algorithm constructed combined with its rapid real - time execution ( see appendix d ) enables us to perform an extensive range of simulations , both in terms of the parameter regime studied and in terms of the forcing applied . in this section",
    "we use this tool in a number numerical experiments .    in section [ subsec : bz ] , we first prove our diagnostic for the failure of previous numerical attempts ( paper i , bz06 ) to reach a dynamical equilibrium qualitatively similar to the one studied by gm98 . we reproduce a quasi - steady state similar to the one achieved by bz06 , and study its scaling properties .",
    "we show that the meridional flow velocities induced in the tachocline , when the radiative  convective interface is modelled as an impermeable boundary , are always too low to confine the field .",
    "we contrast this result in section [ subsec : pump ] with a similar calculation in which meridional flows are directly pumped through the boundary ( through some unspecified radial forcing mechanism ) .",
    "we show that their amplitude remains sufficiently high in the tachocline to provide significant field confinement .",
    "we then perform a suit of simulations in section [ subsec : explor ] , in the `` desirable '' parameter regime specifically selected in section [ subsubsec : paramsreg ] , and discuss the numerically derived solutions both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "we show that the system can , in some situations and for low - enough diffusivities , achieve a balance qualitatively similar to that of the gm98 model , but that the solutions also reveal a number of previously unaccounted - for dynamical subtelties ( see sections [ subsec : fieldconf ] , [ subsec : omvsf ] and [ subsec : ekmanrole ] ) .        in this first numerical experiment",
    ", we compare our quasi - steady solutions with those integrated by bz06 .",
    "note that since the overall interior magnetic field strength decays slightly in their time - dependent calculations , while our steady - state solutions fix the value of the field amplitude near the inner boundary , the two simulations can only be compared qualitatively at best .",
    "nonetheless , the comparison is meaningful since the system is thought to relax to a quasi - steady equilibrium on a timescale comparable with the meridional circulation timescale , which is argued ( by bz06 ) to be much shorter than the magnetic diffusion timescale .    to achieve the same parameter regime as the one selected by bz06 in terms of the diffusivities , we set @xmath160 and progressively reduce @xmath161 from about @xmath162 to 1 .",
    "when @xmath163 , our diffusivities are the same in the tachocline region as theirs .",
    "naturally , we select @xmath164 to mimic an impermeable boundary as in bz06 .",
    "we also modify our bottom boundary conditions to be `` stress - free '' , again to be consistent with their simulations .",
    "finally , the radial component of the magnetic field on the inner boundary is set to be same as the initial condition selected by bz06 ( i.e. @xmath165 g at the poles at @xmath9 ) .",
    "the results for @xmath163 ( see equation ( [ eq : bzf2 ] ) ) are shown in figure [ fig : bzsimu ] .",
    "the overall structure of the streamlines and of the magnetic fields lines , as well as the amplitude of the toroidal field and of the differential rotation compare qualitatively well with the simulations of bz06 ( see the @xmath166gyr solution in figures 4 and 5 of bz06 ) .",
    "small discrepancies in the magnetic field geometry can be attributed to the fact that their magnetic field is diffusing out of their inner core , while it is maintained in our simulation by a permanent dipole .",
    "this steady - state calculation therefore confirms the main conclusion of the study carried out by bz06 , namely that in the case where the radiative  convective interface is modelled as an impermeable boundary , the only possible quasi - steady solution has an unconfined field structure leading to a differentially rotating ferraro state .",
    "we now justify our diagnostic of the failure of `` impermeable simulations '' to find a confined - field solution .",
    "the induced meridional flows in this set of simulations are generated primarily by ekman pumping on the boundary .",
    "indeed , the magnetic field strength selected by bz06 implies a field of the order of a few tens of gauss at the most near the outer boundary , and therefore according to the analysis of section [ subsubsec : paramsreg ] a boundary layer in the ekman regime rather than in the hartmann regime . in that case , the flow amplitudes are in fact well - estimated by the ( non - magnetic ) work of gb08 and scale as @xmath167",
    "this is verified in figure [ fig : bzur ] , which shows the radial velocity profile of the flows as a function of latitude , well below the ekman layer ( at @xmath168 ) , in three different simulations : for @xmath163 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the meridional flow velocity decreases linearly with @xmath161 , and can in fact be shown to scale as predicted above .    as a result",
    ", one can straightforwardly see that the magnetic reynolds number does not increase with decreasing @xmath171 when the respective diffusivity ratios are held constant : with r@xmath172 defined as in equation ( [ eq : rm ] ) , if @xmath149 is proportional to @xmath173 then the magnetic reynolds number is in fact proportional to @xmath174 and remains roughly constant as @xmath161 decreases .",
    "the effective magnetic reynolds number of the bz06 simulations can be estimated from the flow amplitudes calculated in figure [ fig : bzur ] to be @xmath175  far too low to influence the magnetic field .    using",
    "the true solar diffusivities would not change the situation since in that case it can be shown that the expected magnetic reynolds number is of the order of @xmath176 .",
    "we have therefore confirmed our original diagnostic , namely that the reason for the failure of numerical simulations to find confined - field solutions is not related to the fact that the diffusivities in the simulations are too high ( i.e. selecting solar diffusivities would yield a similar result ) , but rather to a fundamental mis - representation of the radiative  convective interface .      following the original idea proposed by gm98",
    ", we now explore the possibility of confining the interior field through flows which are directly downwelling from the convection zone . as shown by gb08 , flows which are pumped into and out of the radiative zone ( by stresses in the convection zone for example ) can retain significant amplitudes throughout much of the tachocline ( and below ) , and could therefore result in a magnetic reynolds number larger than unity for low enough diffusivities .",
    "we illustrate this idea with a qualitative example , which , for ease of comparison with the results of the previous section , is selected to have the same diffusivity ratios and magnetic field strength as those of bz06 .",
    "we now select a radial velocity profile @xmath90 which satisfies the following properties : ( i ) @xmath177 ( the radial velocity is zero on the polar axis ) , and the flow is symmetric with respect to the equator ( ii ) the total mass flux through the boundary ( at @xmath178 ) is zero : @xmath179 and ( iii ) the total angular momentum flux carried by the meridional circulation through the boundary is zero : @xmath180 the simplest solution which satisfies all three constraints is a 6-th order polynomial in @xmath181 : @xmath182 where @xmath183 and @xmath184 is the radial velocity at the equator .",
    "an example of this profile can be seen in figure [ fig : uforcing ] : for the values of @xmath185 and @xmath186 given in ( [ eq : ocz ] ) the upwelling region is centered at @xmath187 latitude , and ranges from @xmath188 to @xmath189 .",
    "note that the selection of the `` simplest '' profile is fairly arbitrary  had we chosen a different set of orthogonal functions , we would have obtained a slightly different flow profile .",
    "one may also wish instead to select a profile where the width and position of the upwelling region is prescribed , or instead of selecting the polar velocity to be zero , to select the equatorial velocity to be zero , etc ... the only necessary constraints , however , are zero mass and angular momentum fluxes",
    ". these conditions are often ignored , but are crucial to obtaining meaningful results ; failure to satisfy them yields unphysical angular velocity profiles ( see garaud , 2007 ) .      in the simulation presented here ,",
    "the diffusivities are selected as in equation ( [ eq : bzf2 ] ) with @xmath163 .",
    "a radial meridional flow profile is imposed at the outer boundary ( see equation ( [ eq : urout ] ) ) , with an amplitude @xmath184 which is progressively increased from 0 to about -5.5",
    "the resulting numerical solution is presented in figure [ fig : bzwithu ] .",
    "it clearly shows that the field lines are strongly distorted by the meridional flows , and seem to be confined both near the equator , and more importantly also near the poles .",
    "in fact , our results appear to be at least qualitatively similar to the analytical solutions of wood & mcintyre ( 2007 ) , which focussed on the polar regions only .",
    "the angular velocity profile is very different from the one observed in the simulations shown in figure [ fig : bzsimu ] and reveals uniform rotation from the equator up to about 60@xmath190 in latitude .",
    "the rotation rate of the inner core is found to be 0.86@xmath191 .",
    "we have therefore shown that , at least on a qualitative basis , magnetic field confinement is possible provided a radial flow is imposed near the radiative  convective interface .",
    "having proved on a qualitative basis that the gm98 model may indeed lead to global field confinement , we now turn to a more quantitative analysis of the resulting tachocline dynamics . for this purpose , we return to using the boundary conditions discussed in section [ subsec : numbcs ] .    in what will be referred to from here on as the `` fiducial model '' , the enhancements factors @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath108 are now selected as follows to be in the `` desirable '' parameter range discussed in section [ subsubsec : paramsreg ] : @xmath192 and the factor @xmath161 is progressively reduced from @xmath193 down to @xmath194 typically ( @xmath195 for the lowest case ) . for @xmath196 , and in the tachocline region , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 . in that case , and for all simulations , @xmath200 ( guaranteeing that the thermo - viscous mode lengthscale is indeed of the order of the entire radiative zone ) , and @xmath201 .",
    "note that the simulations of bz06 use a prandtl number of the order of 300@xmath202 , which does not satisfy our criterion for the hierarchy of the expected characteristic lengthscales .    the magnetic field strength on the inner boundary at the pole is selected to be @xmath203 t , so that the field strength in the tachocline would be of the order of 1 t in the absence of meridional flows .",
    "the radial flow velocity at the outer boundary is the one discussed in section [ subsubsec : urforcing ] with @xmath204cm / s , and the latitudinal flow velocity is everywhere zero .",
    "the qualitative evolution of the poloidal field topology and of the angular velocity profile as @xmath161 is reduced can be seen in figure [ fig : fvaryombp ] , while the corresponding figure for the streamlines and the temperature profile is figure [ fig : fvarypsit ] . in all simulations ,",
    "the viscous ekman number is much smaller than one .",
    "the magnetic field begins to affect the angular velocity profile as @xmath161 decreases from @xmath205 to @xmath206 , notably in the deeper interior .",
    "this transition occurs when the magnetic ekman number drops below one .",
    "the structure of the temperature perturbation profile changes as @xmath161 is decreased from @xmath206 down to @xmath207 , which is attributed this time to the `` thermal '' ekman number approaching one .",
    "finally , there is a clear transition between the `` unconfined field '' configuration for @xmath208 and the `` confined field '' configuration for @xmath209 , which corresponds to the magnetic reynolds number increasing to values above unity .",
    "contrary to the impermeable - boundary case studied by bz06 , the radial flow velocities do not decrease with the diffusivities , but are actually seen to increase as @xmath161 is reduced .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : urfid ] , which shows the radial flow velocity near the base of the presumed tachocline ( at @xmath210 , as in figure [ fig : bzur ] ) , as a function of latitude , for three values of @xmath161 .",
    "provided @xmath211 , it appears that @xmath212 although this scaling can not , for numerical reasons , be explored over many orders of magnitude . as a result ,",
    "the nonlinear interaction of the flow and the field rapidly becomes stronger and the field appears to be more and more confined , as can be seen in the last panel of figure [ fig : fvaryombp ] .",
    "we now decrease @xmath161 as far as possible , until convergence becomes too difficult .",
    "the lowest value achieved in the fiducial model is @xmath213 and the results are presented in figure [ fig : bestsim ] .",
    "the number of radial meshpoints used is 3000 , and the number of latitudinal modes is 80 ( note that since only even modes are selected to guarantee equatorial symmetry , solving for 80 modes means that the highest fourier mode considered actually is @xmath214 , see appendix c ) .",
    "the top - right quadrant of figure [ fig : bestsim ] shows representative streamlines .",
    "the ekman layer near the outer boundary , of width @xmath215 , is just visible in the top - right strip .",
    "the ekman layer flow does indeed downwell at the poles and equator , and upwells in mid - latitudes .",
    "more clearly visible is the `` thermo - viscous '' mode below the ekman layer , which ( rather unexpectedly , to be honest ) has the opposite structure : downwelling in mid - latitudes and upwelling near the poles and equator .",
    "this mode appears to be confined roughly within @xmath216 \\rsun$ ] , an effect which can only be attributed to the lorentz forces arising from the magnetic field underneath .",
    "indeed , the solutions of gb08 in the absence of magnetic fields in the same parameter regime do not reveal any structure on this typical lengthscale .",
    "the associated effect of the flow in confining the magnetic field is also obvious in the bottom - left quadrant : the field lines are most strongly distorted away from the strictly dipolar structure in the same region ( @xmath216 \\rsun$ ] ) .",
    "field confinement is discussed in more detail in section [ subsec : fieldconf ] .",
    "the solution for the angular velocity profile is again more complex than expected : the combination of the two modes of propagation of the meridional flows creates radial structures both on the ekman scale and on a larger scale ( @xmath217 ) , as well as latitudinal structures which are clearly seen to be correlated with the magnetic field lines .",
    "however , contrary to the solution shown in figure [ fig : bzsimu ] , there is no clear evidence for a _ large - scale _ latitudinal or radial gradient in @xmath218 below about 0.6@xmath109 , including in the polar regions .",
    "this is the first set of self - consistent simulations to reveal this kind of solution . since the angular velocity profile inferred from helioseismic inversions",
    "can be thought of as a weighted spatial average of the true angular velocity profile in the sun , and since the spatial extent of the averaging kernels is much larger than the features seen in the simulations , the angular velocity profile shown in figure [ fig : bestsim ] would be observationally interpreted to be uniform below @xmath219 , whereas the one shown in figure [ fig : bzsimu ] would not . the actual value of the rotation rate calculated in the simulations is discussed in section [ subsec : omvsf ]",
    ".    a closer look at the angular velocity profile in the region @xmath220 \\rsun$ ] ( see the bottom - right strip ) reveals a change in the dominant angular momentum transport processes between the uppermost layers ( @xmath221 ) and the lower layers ( @xmath222 ) . when @xmath221 the angular velocity contours are more - or - less aligned with the streamlines , whereas for @xmath222 the angular velocity contours are aligned with the magnetic field lines .",
    "this is at least qualitatively consistent with the idea proposed by gm98 of a multi - layered tachocline , in which the dynamics of the uppermost layer are controlled by the tachocline flows , while the dynamics of the bulk of the radiative zone are controlled by the primordial field .",
    "the interface between the two regions , which could be identified with the `` magnetic diffusion layer '' of the gm98 model , clearly has quite a complex topology .",
    "one can also observe a number of very strong localised `` jets '' of more rapidly or more slowly rotating fluid .",
    "the jets appear to be stronger for lower diffusivities ( one can easily compare the results of figure [ fig : bestsim ] with the last panel of figure [ fig : fvaryombp ] ) .",
    "in fact , we tentatively attribute the numerical scheme s failure to find solution for @xmath223 to an intrinsic instability of the jets . but whether such strong features would exist in the sun is debatable : both the imposed flow velocities and the magnetic field strength have been artificially increased by many orders of magnitude to ensure a magnetic reynolds number greater than one in the simulations , and a hartmann number closer to that of the sun ( see section [ subsubsec : paramsreg ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the amplitude of these jets is also artificially increased in the simulations compared with what one may expect in the sun .",
    "unfortunately , given the nonlinear nature of the problem , it is difficult to predict what the actual strength of these jets would be should diffusivities , magnetic field and imposed flows velocities be simultaneously reduced to the expected solar values .      to study the nature of field confinement more quantitatively",
    ", we consider the ratio @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the hypothetical radial component of the solution for the magnetic field in the purely diffusive case : @xmath226 typically , we expect that @xmath227 when magnetic field lines are either completely expelled from a region , or bent to the horizontal . on the other hand , we expect that @xmath228 in regions where the magnetic field lines are pushed together by converging ( latitudinal ) flows .",
    "it is therefore a good diagnostic of the processes we are interested in .",
    "the quantity @xmath229 is shown in figure [ fig : fielddiff ] for various simulations .",
    "the top two quadrants are derived from the numerical solutions for @xmath230 and @xmath213 respectively , and reveal a strong change in the behaviour of the solutions when @xmath231 and @xmath232 .    in the case where @xmath230",
    ", we observe a good match between the spatial variation of @xmath229 and the imposed forcing : @xmath233 in downwelling regions and @xmath228 in the upwelling regions ( at mid - latitudes ) .",
    "however , the amplitude of @xmath229 remains close to one , revealing only a very weak effect of the flow on the field .",
    "this is not entirely surprising since the magnetic reynolds number for @xmath230 can be deduced from the flow amplitude shown in figure [ fig : urfid ] to be @xmath234 at @xmath235 .",
    "in fact , in this very weakly nonlinear regime there is some evidence for a correlation ( see figure [ fig : fielddiff ] , bottom left quadrant ) between @xmath236 and @xmath161 : we find that @xmath237 .",
    "however , figure [ fig : fielddiff ] also reveals that matters become more complex as @xmath147 increases above unity . for @xmath238",
    "the magnetic reynolds number is now of the order of @xmath239 , and the connection between the field and the meridional flow is correspondingly fully nonlinear .",
    "the correlation between @xmath236 and @xmath161 breaks down , as seen in the bottom right quadrant .",
    "this incidentally proves that the kind of boundary conditions advocated by kitchatinov & rdiger ( 2006 ) to mimic `` field confinement by meridional flows '' can not accurately describe the nonlinear dynamics of the system .",
    "we also observe that the regions of enhancement and reduction of the radial field are no longer perfectly correlated with the _ imposed _ upwelling / downwelling regions .",
    "in fact , some enhancement in the radial field strength can be seen near the equator as well as near the polar regions .",
    "this can be attributed to the convergence points of the meridional flows _ below _ the ekman layer , which , as seen in figure [ fig : bestsim ] have the opposite sign as that of the imposed flow .",
    "all in all , although there is definite evidence for magnetic field confinement along the lines of the model proposed by gm98 , it is probably fair to say that the system behaves in a far more complex way than anticipated , and that the simulations in the fiducial model are just beginning to scratch the surface of the `` interesting '' regime .      as in paper",
    "i , we consider the angular velocity of the inner core @xmath240 ( which is an eigenvalue of the calculation performed ) as a diagnostic of the most important angular momentum transport processes , and of the `` accuracy '' of the model in reproducing the observations .",
    "this quantity is shown in figure [ fig : omvsf ] as a function of @xmath161 for the fiducial model , and for simulations with faster and slower imposed flows .    in very diffusive simulations ,",
    "the predicted angular velocity @xmath241 is consistent with purely viscous angular momentum transport throughout the entire interior ( see gough , 1985 ) . as @xmath161 is progressively reduced , the system undergoes a rather impressive bifurcation at @xmath242 , which corresponds to the change of nature of the boundary layer near the inner core from an ekman layer to an ekman - hartmann layer .",
    "when this happens , a new flow cell of opposite vorticity appears right against the inner core , so that angular momentum transport changes direction .",
    "this leads to a rather dramatic jump in the inner core rotation rate , which is unlikely to be of any relevance to the sun , but deserved an explanation .",
    "note that the critical value of @xmath161 for which the bifurcation occurs is proportional to the imposed magnetic field strength @xmath80 .    in the case of the fiducial model , the angular velocity of the core",
    "then remains roughly constant ( @xmath243 ) as @xmath161 is further reduced by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this range corresponds to the regime where @xmath231 , where the magnetic field lines essentially remain dipolar .",
    "in fact , the same inner core velocity is also found for lower imposed flow velocities ( see figure [ fig : omvsf ] ) , as well as for higher and lower field strength ( always with @xmath231 ) .",
    "this suggests that the value @xmath244 is a rather universal characteristic of angular momentum transport by dipolar fields in the hartmann regime , in this particular geometry , and subject to this particular imposed angular velocity profile at the outer boundary .",
    "however , it is clear from the analysis of section [ subsec : fieldconf ] that the simulations in the fiducial model have not quite yet reached the asymptotic regime even for the lowest values of @xmath161 achieved . as a matter of fact , in the last few points of the fiducial model curve ( in the region where @xmath147 begins to exceed one )",
    ", @xmath245 is seen to change more rapidly , decreasing slightly below 0.87 @xmath191 .",
    "the role of the meridional flows as angular momentum transporters can best be seen in a simulation with much higher imposed flow velocities ( see the curve with the triangular symbols , for @xmath246cm / s ) . in these simulations , the transition to @xmath232 occurs for values of @xmath161 typically 10 times larger than in the fiducial model . in that case , we observe that the predicted core velocity is notably different from the other two cases , and changes rather rapidly with @xmath161 .",
    "it is therefore more than likely that the predicted angular velocity of the core in the fiducial model would also begin to deviate more noticeably away from @xmath247 were we able to continue decreasing @xmath161 .",
    "again , we are only beginning to approach the asymptotic regime so that the simulated angular velocity of the core can not yet and should not be compared directly with that of the sun .",
    "despite the difficulties encountered when attempting to find numerical solutions for asymptotically low values of the diffusivities , the nonlinear dynamics which emerge from our simulations are closer to what one may expect from the gm98 model than any other simulation performed to date .",
    "more precisely we do observe ( see section [ subsec : explor ] ) the quenching of the large - scale differential rotation by the primordial magnetic field , even in the polar regions .",
    "we also observe the partial confinement of the field by the meridional flows to the radiative interior ( see section [ subsec : fieldconf ] ) , with the reduction of the radial field strength ( in some regions ) by more than 70% .",
    "finally , we observe the concurrent confinement of the meridional flows to the upper layers of the radiative zone ( @xmath221 ) by the magnetic field . we have not yet been able to reduce the diffusivities down sufficiently far to observe a truly segregated structure where the bulk of the tachocline flows are completely magnetic - free",
    ". however , there is evidence in the observed rotation profile ( see figure [ fig : bestsim ] ) for a transition between regions where angular - momentum transport is dominated by the meridional flows , and regions where it is dominated by the magnetic field .",
    "the `` magnetic diffusion layer '' studied by gm98 , which is thought to control this transition , appears to have a rather complex geometrical structure which prevents a more detailed study of the gm98 scalings .    the calculated value of the interior angular velocity @xmath245 ( see section [ subsec : omvsf ] ) does not match the observed value .",
    "however , since even the lowest - diffusivity simulations presented here are only just beginning to enter the asymptotic parameter regime described in section [ subsubsec : paramsreg ] we do not view the poor match with the observations as an intrinsic problem with the gm98 model ( yet ) but rather as evidence that more work should be done to decrease the diffusivities even further  a challenging task .",
    "as described in section [ subsec : explor ] , the convergence of the solutions becomes rather difficult when the values of the diffusivities are decreased below a certain threshold ( in the fiducial model for @xmath223 ) .",
    "the typical reasons for this convergence failure were listed and discussed in section [ subsubsec : convsol ] : intrinsic linear / nonlinear instabilities or insufficient latitudinal resolution . in this particular case ,",
    "the various scenarios are equally plausible , and difficult to disentangle without a supporting fully nonlinear 3d calculation .",
    "the field configuration near the inner core could be subject to instabilities ( as seen in the simulations of bz06 ) .",
    "the ekman(-hartmann ) layer near the outer boundary could also be subject to instabilities , or could be developing latitudinal structures which are too fine to resolve ( see figure [ fig : el ] ) .",
    "we have in fact tentatively identified the emergence of strong jets in the angular velocity profile ( see figure [ fig : bestsim ] for example ) as the most likely source of instabilities ( and convergence failure ) , but the reader should be cautionned that this statement is only speculative .    as mentioned in section [ subsec : explor ] , whether the equilibrium governed by the gm98 model is stable or unstable can not directly be inferred from the stability of the numerical solutions ( since they operate in a different parameter regime ) but it is clearly a fundamental question .",
    "should our diagnostic concerning the stability of the jets prove to be correct , then a possible path for future investigation ( using this relaxation method ) may be to continue searching for solutions , starting where we left off , and slowly lowering simultaneously the amplitude of the imposed flow ( and field ) with the diffusivities to limit the strength of the jets generated .",
    "this could be seen as blindly navigating the stable regions of parameter space while avoiding instability reefs .",
    "but what could ideally be derived from such an exercise , should we be able to acquire sufficient data , are scaling relationships between the jet strength , the diffusivities and the imposed flow strength which may then be used to infer tentative information on the stability of the gm98 solution itself .",
    "our simulations have also revealed a fundamental difference with the original gm98 model : the presence and role of an ekman mode . while it is clear from figure [ fig : bestsim ] that the ekman flows themselves play no role in confining the field ( contrary to the claims made by kitchatinov & rdiger 2006 ) our simulations reveal that the role of the ekman layer is still far from trivial .",
    "indeed , the differential rotation profile imposed at the radiative  convective interface is quite different from the differential rotation profile transmitted by the ekman layer .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : el ] , which shows the evolution of the angular velocity profile with depth across the ekman layer .",
    "thus while the gm98 model correctly describes the non - viscous tachocline dynamics _ below _ the ekman layer , the ekman mode could in fact influence the system by modifying the angular velocity profile `` seen '' by the bulk of the tachocline .",
    "the extent to which this effect influences the tachocline is unclear .",
    "firstly , other processes which also transport angular momentum ( convective overshoot , gravity waves , small - scale and large - scale magnetic stresses associated with the dynamo field ) are known to take place in the close vicinity of the radiative  convective interface .",
    "these processes were not included in gm98 s analysis and can not be modelled with the present numerical algorithm , but could equally affect the tachocline dynamics .",
    "secondly , ekman layers ( laminar or turbulent ) must _ by definition _",
    "be present in any rotating system which exhibits very rapid changes in the imposed stresses .",
    "however , whether the ekman mode actually plays an important role in the tachocline dynamics depends on the relative importance of the bulk thermal - wind stresses and the combination of all the other rapidly varying turbulent stresses ( see figure [ fig : bls ] ) .",
    "indeed , if the base of the convection zone is already essentially in thermal - wind balance ( see miesch , 2005 for instance ) , then the amplitude of the ekman mode and its effect on the angular velocity profile will be small ( gb08 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if this is not the case then significant ekman flows are expected ( as in the simulations shown in the present work for example ) , with the aforementionned consequences .",
    "the present work has emphasized the necessity of flows downwelling from the solar convection zone as a means to confine the internal primordial field and guarantee the uniform rotation of the radiative interior as originally proposed by gm98 .",
    "the nature of the thermal and dynamical balance governing the convection zone itself therefore also controls the dynamics of the tachocline through the spatial variation and amplitude of the flows crossing the radiative  convective interface .",
    "meanwhile , steady progress in modelling the convection zone has emphasized its dependence on the thermal stratification of the tachocline ( rempel , 2005 ; miesch , brun & toomre , 2006 ) .",
    "one can only conclude that the dynamics of the convective and radiative regions are intrinsically and fundamentally coupled through this internal layer called the tachocline , and that the only sensible way forward from this point on is the construction of whole - sun models including both regions .",
    "this work is the outcome of nearly ten years of discussions with many colleagues , including nic brummell , sacha brun , gary glatzmaier , douglas gough , michael mcintyre , tamara rogers , nigel weiss , jean - paul zahn .",

    "the spherically symmetric background solar model selected for this paper is model s of christensen - dalsgaard _ et al . _",
    "model s provides calculated solar data for all of the relevant thermodynamical and compositional quantities on a fixed mesh . in particular , we use the provided fields @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 ( where @xmath114 is the buoyancy frequency ) , @xmath253 and @xmath254 ( where @xmath255 is the specific heat at constant pressure , and @xmath256 is the rosseland mean opacity ) . in order to use this data for our purpose , we need to interpolate it upon our own selected numerical mesh , using a standard rational interpolation routine ( cf . numerical recipes ) . the task is delicate since any `` roughness '' in the interpolated functions results in failure of convergence of the numerical algorithm , and the two numerical meshes are intrinsically non - uniform : model s has meshpoints strongly concentrated near the solar surface , near @xmath78 and at the base of the convection zone @xmath257 , while our numerical mesh has meshpoints strongly concentrated near the domain boundaries @xmath55 and @xmath95 .",

    "1996 ) most of the computational cost ( both in terms of time and memory ) arises from reading and inverting a block - tridiagonal matrix containing @xmath324 rows of 3 blocks ( where @xmath325 is equal to the number of meshpoints used , typically between 2000 and 3000 ) , and where each block has size @xmath326 where @xmath317 is the total number of dependent variables ( @xmath327 , where @xmath114 is 6080 for a typical run ) .",
    "calculation of the matrix components , followed by its inversion using serial partial pivoting can require several hours per iteration on a high - end desktop .",
    "in addition , memory becomes an issue since the standard algorithm typically requires the storage of @xmath325 double - precision arrays of size @xmath328 before back - substitution can proceed .",
    "for this reason , we have developped a parallel version of the nrk solver .",
    "a serial , simple and efficient way of inverting the typical block - tridiagonal linear systems arising from two - point boundary value problems is described by press _ et al . _",
    "given the matrix structure @xmath329 the algorithm consists in diagonalizing the first top @xmath330 ( middle ) block using gauss - jordan elimination with partial implicit pivoting , and storing the resulting modified @xmath331 block and right - hand side for later back - substitution . moving onto the second block - row , we zero the @xmath332 block , diagonalize the @xmath330 block and store the modified @xmath331 block ( and modified right - hand - side vector ) , and so forth .",
    "the resulting matrix structure is @xmath333 where @xmath334 denotes a `` zeroed '' block , @xmath335 is the identity , and @xmath336 is a stored block .",
    "the last step involves sweeping the matrix back from bottom to top to back - substitute for the unknown variables .",
    "this method requires minimal storage : firstly , each block - row only needs to be read just before being processed and secondly , the backsubstitution step only requires knowledge of the blocks @xmath336 and modified right - hand - side vector .",
    "inverting the same linear system in parallel is not obvious since the previous algorithm is inherently serial .",
    "a standard parallel method used for block tridiagonal matrices is cyclic reduction ( see golub & ortega , 1993 ) . in this case , the number of variables is successively halved by repeating the following reduction algorithm : diagonalize all @xmath330-blocks in odd block - rows by partial implicit pivoting , then zero the @xmath331 and @xmath332 matrices directly above and below by gaussian elimination .",
    "the resulting matrix after the first reduction is : @xmath337 where @xmath336 denotes a block that has been modified and needs to be stored for later back - substitution , and @xmath338 denotes blocks that have been modified and will be used in the next reduction step .",
    "note that all of the remaining @xmath338 blocks ( in the odd block - rows ) form a new block - tridiagonal system for roughly half the number of variables ( more precisely , if the initial number of block - rows is @xmath339 then the reduction step reduces it to @xmath340 ) .",
    "the algorithm can be repeated until only 1 block is left and finally inverted , at which point backsubstitution can begin .",
    "the main advantage of the method is its inherently parallelizable nature , since each process can be instructed to reduce a number of blocks more - or - less independently of the others ; communication between processes is minimal until the final steps where the number of remaining block - rows is equal to the number of processes .",
    "unfortunately , the stability of this cyclic reduction algorithm is much weaker that the stability of the serial algorithm ( since the matrix can not be globally pivoted ) , and was found to be unreliable for our purpose .",
    "an alternative parallel algorithm was constructed , loosely based on the work of wright ( 1992 ) .",
    "the block - rows are first equally distributed between the processes . a first sweeping reduction akin to the serial algorithm",
    "is performed starting from the top block - row down to the second - to - last block - row in each process to transform the matrix to @xmath341 ( assuming in the case shown here that 12 block - rows are equally distributed between 3 processes ) .",
    "again , by convention all @xmath336 blocks denote blocks that need to be stored for backsubstitution , while @xmath338 blocks are blocks that will be further modified . until this point ,",
    "work in each process can be done without communication with other processes .    at the end of the sweeping step",
    ", each process sends its very last block - row to the following process .",
    "thus the blocks are redistributed as @xmath342 each process can then continue eliminating undesirable variables from its top block - row by gaussian elimination with the successive block - rows below , until the following form is achieved : @xmath343 at this point , the top - rows in each process can be combined into a much - reduced block tri - diagonal system .",
    "solution from here on proceeds with a cyclic reduction of the remaining blocks across processes , followed by a back - substitution step .",
    "the operation count of this algorithm is the same as that of the standard cyclic reduction .",
    "the advantages of this algorithm over the standard cyclic reduction are two - fold .",
    "firstly , it is found to be much more stable ( wright , 1992 ) .",
    "secondly , it is far more versatile , since the standard algorithm only performs ideally with a number of block - rows equal to @xmath344 ( for any integer @xmath14 ) , which seriously constrains the number of meshpoints one is allowed to select . on the other hand , in this algorithm",
    "it is always possible to balance the load ( for any number of meshpoints ) in such a way that any process contains at most one more block - row than the average .",
    "finally , we note that the user - interface of the complete associated parallel version of the newton - raphson - kantorovich algorithm ( relax ) is entirely identical to that of the widely used serial nrk algorithm written by gough & moore .",
    "transfer between the parallel and serial version should be transparent to the user .",
    "the relax algorithm is freely available upon request from p. garaud ."
