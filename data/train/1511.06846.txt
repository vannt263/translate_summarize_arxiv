    "now that the last missing piece of the standard model ( sm ) , the higgs boson , has been discovered @xcite , it would become a main subject in particle physics to pursue theory beyond the sm . however , there are not many phenomena observed which can provide clues to the new theory . examining",
    "the higgs boson and its related phenomena from various aspects is thus very important . in experimental measurements for the higgs boson , the production cross section @xcite and the branching ratios of the decays into @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite , and @xmath2 @xcite are not inconsistent with the sm .",
    "however , there seems to be sizable room for allowing theory which deviates from it .",
    "the awaited clues may possibly be found in studying the higgs boson .    from a theoretical point of view , supersymmetry may be considered one fundamental symmetry existing in nature .",

    "there exist three neutral higgs bosons and a charged higgs boson .",

    "supersymmetry might be examined only in the higgs sector or indirect effects such as cp violation @xcite .",
    "we study violation of cp symmetry for the higgs bosons of the supersymmetric model in which the higgs sector contains an su(2)-triplet superfield besides ordinary two doublet ones .",
    "this cp symmetry is conserved in the higgs sector at tree level within the framework of the sm or of the mssm .",
    "however , the additional superfield violates cp invariance generally at tree level .",
    "all the complex coefficients of the lagrangian can not be eliminated by redefining particle fields , unless some accidental cancellation is assumed .",

    "this decay process is generated at one - loop level , to which the @xmath3 quark , @xmath4 quark , or @xmath5 boson contributes dominantly . since the higgs boson is not in a cp eigenstate , both cp - even and cp - odd final states are induced for polarization of the two photons .",
    "this cp - violating effect can be observed even if the supersymmetric @xmath6-odd particles are all heavy and undetectable in near future experiments .",
    "we discuss disagreement of cp eigenstate and mass eigenstate for the higgs bosons , and perform numerical analyses of the widths for polarization states which could be detected by measuring the polarization planes of the photons .    in the mssm it may be possible that radiative corrections by the interactions with the @xmath3 squarks generate mixing of cp - even and cp - odd fields for the higgs boson @xcite .",
