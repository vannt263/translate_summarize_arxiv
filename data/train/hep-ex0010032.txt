    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) describes the inelastic scattering between a proton and an antiproton as a hard collision between their constituents or partons : quarks or gluons . after the collision , the outgoing partons hadronize into streams of particles called jets . at the tevatron energies , ( @xmath0=1800  gev and @xmath0=630  gev ) ,",

    "the high center - of - mass energy at the tevatron and the unprecedented accuracy of the measurements , together with the nlo - qcd theoretical predictions derived during the last decade , have improved our understanding of qcd , our knowledge of the proton structure , and pushed the limit to the scale associated with quark compositeness .    in this paper , we include a summary of some of the most significant jet results published by  cdf and d as well as their most recent preliminary measurements .",
