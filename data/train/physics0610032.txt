    "the ionization process in atomic systems exposed to a strong laser field has attracted great interest during the past decades and its proper modeling remains a challenge to theory  @xcite . among the numerous approximations developed to treat this problem keldysh theory  @xcite possesses a prominent role .",
    "this theory was proposed by keldysh 40 years ago and describes the ionization process as a transition between an initial electronic bound and a volkov continuum state ( adopting the length gauge formulation ) . besides the main approximation of the keldysh theory , the neglect of the interaction of the escaping electron with the long - range coulomb potential ( in the case of a neutral atom ) ,",
    "two additional simplifications were made in  @xcite : ( i ) the method of steepest descent ( msd )  @xcite ( saddle - point approximation ) for performing an occurring contour integral , and ( ii ) the assumption of a small kinetic momentum of the escaping electron .",
    "the keldysh approximation and variants of it are also very popular , because they are the basis for methods that predict strong - field ionization rates also for heavier atoms and molecules ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , there has been proposals to obtain an exact keldysh theory by removing the two additional simplifications ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "it was especially suggested to avoid approximation ( i ) by solving the occurring contour integrals with the aid of the exact residue theorem ( rt ) instead of the msd  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the rt method yields a two times larger transition amplitude for the 1s state of a hydrogen - like atom and , as a consequence , a four times larger ionization rate .",
    "furthermore , the ionization rate of the first excited ( 2s ) state obtained in  @xcite when applying the rt differs significantly from the msd result . in view of the popularity of the msd approximation for treating strong - field problems like ionization  @xcite or high - harmonic generation  @xcite",
    "this is of course a very important result .",
    "this has motivated the present study in which a careful reinvestigation of the rt and the msd is performed ( sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the application of the rt as proposed in  @xcite contains an unjustified neglect of the contribution of one integral and that it is this omission which is the main source for the previously reported deviation between the rt and the msd results .",
    "therefore , the msd provides in fact more reliable results than the ( incomplete ) rt approach .",
    "it is furthermore discussed that the msd fails for rydberg states and a correction to it is proposed .",
    "the conclusions of sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] are supported with the aid of a numerical study in sec .",
    "[ sec : test ] .",
    "in order to provide the basis for the subsequent discussion and to introduce the notation a brief summary of the keldysh theory is given that follows closely the one described in appendix a of  @xcite .",
    "the total ionization rate of a one - electron atomic system with the electron binding energy @xmath0 in the harmonic laser field @xmath1 , with the period @xmath2 , can be expressed as the sum over @xmath3-photon processes ( atomic units are used throughout this work ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electron quiver ( ponderomotive ) energy due to the field .",

    "in fact , for excited states of hydrogen - like atoms the therein proposed approach may lead to drastically wrong results .    for spherically symmetric bound states of hydrogen - like atoms with principal quantum number @xmath49",
    "the function @xmath48 can be presented ( see appendix b ) as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an analytical ( and , possibly , slowly varying ) function in the vicinity of the special points @xmath28 . both procedures ( msd and rt ) are considered in this work for general @xmath48 having poles of order @xmath52 at @xmath53 .      since for @xmath54 the function @xmath55 $ ] is analytical in the whole complex plane except the branch cut @xmath42 $ ] and the poles @xmath28 , ( [ ap3 ] ) can be modified using @xmath56 where @xmath27 are contours around @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a contour enclosing @xmath36 and @xmath28 ( see fig.[fig : conta]c ) .",

    "this specific choice of @xmath78 allows to directly apply msd in the following subsection . here ,",
    "cauchy integration rules  @xcite are employed to deduce three useful relations :    * deforming the contour in @xmath6 to pass along @xmath81 in positive direction , along @xmath82 in negative direction and connecting the ends of these contours at infinity one obtains @xmath83 * connecting contours @xmath67 at infinity with the contours @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( see fig .",

    "the fact that for the 1s state of hydrogen - like atoms ( @xmath106 ) one finds exactly a factor 2 difference between msd and rt and thus an equality sign in ( [ ap5 ] ) should be seen as an accidental case that is due to the relative simplicity of @xmath48 for the 1s state .    in section  [ sec : test ] msd is tested numerically and it is shown that the assumption of a slowly varying function @xmath105 is valid only for small @xmath49 ( or @xmath52 ) .",

    "this paves the way for a detailed study of the validity of the keldysh approximation for , e.g. , rydberg atoms that is not blurred by a failure of the usually adopted msd approximation .",
    "it is instructive to compare @xmath124 with the recently published `` two - term saddle - point approximation ''  @xcite .",
    "this approximation is a modification of the `` one - term saddle - point approximation ''  @xcite .",
    "both approximations are based on the principle that only the leading term of the laurent expansion of the fourier transform @xmath20 at the saddle points is considered . since in the `` one - term '' approximation the contributions from higher - order derivatives of @xmath25 are also ignored , it is equivalent to the simple msd formula @xmath109 and yields thus the same numerical results .",

    "for the excited states the `` two - term '' formula fails rapidly and yields results which are even less accurate than the ones obtained with the `` one - term '' formula .",
    "to understand this fact , we remind that the second term in  @xcite comes from the next - to - leading pole , and only the contribution arising from the third derivative of @xmath25 is considered .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that a singularity of the same order can also arise from the next - to - leading term of the laurent expansion of @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , for larger values of @xmath49 it can also be important to consider further terms of the laurent expansion .",
    "since the corrected msd formula ( [ cmsd ] ) takes all of this into account , the resulting @xmath124 is significantly more accurate than @xmath126 .",
    "in this work it has been demonstrated that the residue theorem was not correctly employed in  @xcite , since the derivation was based on an unjustified assumption that one integral vanishes .",
    "this neglected term is , however , of the same order of magnitude as the remaining ones or even much larger . for the 1s state of hydrogen - like atoms",
    "it is almost identical , and thus its omission results in an overestimation of the transition amplitude by a factor two for this case .",
    "this deviation was in  @xcite incorrectly assumed to be a failure of the widely used saddle - point approximation . considering a 2s state ,",
    "it is furthermore concluded that an application of the method proposed in  @xcite to a 2s state would yield an even larger ( erroneous ) deviation .",
    "such a large deviation for the 2s state was in fact reported in  @xcite where also the residue method had been applied .",
    "analogously to  @xcite the deviation was attributed to a failure of the saddle - point method , but is in fact due to the same unjustified omission of a non - vanishing integral .",
    "the direct applicability of the present findings to  @xcite can be verified , since the derivation in  @xcite differs from  @xcite essentially only by the choice of @xmath128 as complex variable , while in  @xcite and the present work @xmath129 was used .",
    "the applicability of the method of steepest descent ( saddle - point approximation ) for arbitrary @xmath49s states has also been investigated in the present work .",
