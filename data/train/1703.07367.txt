    "the observations were performed on 2016 july 16 , in queue mode .",
    "the seeing value was 0.9 arcsec . a predefined dither pattern of nine positions was used .",

    "the first step in the data processing includes the subtraction of dark current frames .",
    "an illumination correction was obtained from twilight sky exposures in order to compensate a decrease of about 40 per cent , from the center to border of the field of view ( fov ) . a correction to remove a pattern of inclined stripes related to reading amplifiers was introduced at this point .",

    "the object appears resolved by visual inspection , but to study the structure more quantitatively , we used the 2d surface brightness model fitting code galfit @xcite .",
    "we considered a model consisting of a single bulge component , described by a srsic profile , and a point spread function ( psf ) to account for the unresolved nuclear component .",
    "the psf was obtained from a single nearby bright star ( @xmath26 = 14.2 ) , hereafter psf1 , at a distance of 25 arcsec east of the target .",
    "we could not consider other close and bright stars to model the psf due to the small fov of our image .",
    "a psf model was built using three gaussians of different widths .",
    "we tested the psf model with a different star in the field and the fit was successful showing no residual excess ( fig .",

    "the residuals of the model psf+srsic ( see fig .  [",

    "the background was fixed to zero , which comes naturally from the data processing , although it exhibits large local variations .",
    "we measured the sky at different regions and obtained a 1@xmath36 rms value , which was used as an input for new galfit models .",
    "the resulting parameters are reported in table  [ ta : galfpar ] and are taken as the parameter uncertainty estimation . the residual image after subtracting only the scaled psf1 shows a rather smooth structure , similar to an elliptical morphology ( see fig .

    "in addition , a positive residual region is observed around 3 arcsec south .",
    "this brightness enhancement has been reported by @xcite , suggesting that it may be the hint of a merger event .    the 1d brightness profile of fbqs  j1644@xmath32619 is shown in fig .  [ fig : radprof ] , as well as the profiles of the psf component and the srsic model .",
    "the profile extends out to a radius @xmath37 5 arcsec . the nuclear contribution becomes weaker than the galactic one already at @xmath38 and this allows us to study the host in great detail .",

    "the 2d surface brightness is fitted up to 5 arcsec ( corresponding to 13 kpc ) by the combination of a nuclear component and a bulge component with a srsic profile with index @xmath4 = 3.7 , indicative of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "the low ellipticity suggests that the host is an e1 galaxy and the structural parameters are consistent with the correlations of effective radius and surface brightness with absolute magnitude measured for elliptical galaxies .",
    "our results seem to contradict the results reported in @xcite for the same target . studying its morphology in the @xmath26 and @xmath28 bands",

    "however , we can not rule out the presence of other low - luminosity components such as , for example , a disc or a bar , on spatial scales larger than about 3 arcsec , where some residuals are present in our fit of the surface brightness distribution of the source ( see fig .  [",

    "this value is compatible with that obtained from our ir observations .",
    "black hole masses in the range ( 1.52.2 ) @xmath29 10@xmath54 m@xmath18 were estimated for 1h 0323@xmath3342 from optical spectroscopy @xcite , while values of ( 1.64.0 ) @xmath29 10@xmath55 m@xmath18 were obtained by using the relation between the bh mass and the bulge luminosity , depending on the model used to reproduce the surface brightness profile @xcite .",
    "a significant discrepancy was also found in the bh mass estimates of pks 2004@xmath52447 . from the @xmath48-band bulge luminosity and the @xmath56@xmath57 relation for pseudo - bulges from @xcite",

    "however , the mass of the host galaxy inferred from the @xmath48-band luminosity by @xcite , @xmath59 = 7 @xmath29 10@xmath60 m@xmath2 , is a typical value of a giant elliptical galaxy . from that value , by using the relation between bh mass , bulge mass , and near - ir luminosity proposed by @xcite , we obtain a bh mass of 10@xmath61 m@xmath18 , not compatible with a spiral galaxy .",
    "as shown earlier , there is a discrepancy between the values of the bh mass obtained from the bulge luminosity and those obtained by scaling relations based on the emission - line properties .",
    "@xcite proposed an explanation in which the blr has a flat structure and the line profile depends on the inclination of its axis with respect to the line of sight .",
    "a similar scenario was proposed by @xcite .",
    "assuming that @xmath0-ray emitters are oriented typically at @xmath62 , the mass value obtained from the line profiles must be corrected by adding a factor between 0.84 and 1.16 dex @xcite , resulting in @xmath63 m@xmath18 , which brings in better agreement the two types of bh mass estimations .    in view of the results of this letter and of the above discussion",
    ", we conclude that there is no clear evidence that the @xmath0-ray - emitting nlsy1 are hosted in spiral galaxies with low bh masses .",
    "in contrast , in the case of fbqs j1644@xmath32619 the host is a typical e1 galaxy and the bh mass is well above the limit characterizing radio - loud agn , i.e.  @xmath64/m@xmath65 @xcite .",
    "several studies indicate that powerful jets in agn are produced only by the most massive black holes , with @xmath66 m@xmath18 .",
    "this idea has been challenged by the discovery of @xmath0-ray emission from a few radio - loud nlsy1 galaxies , usually hosted in spiral galaxies with small bh masses ( @xmath67@xmath17 m@xmath18 ) , suggesting that their relativistic jets might be produced by a different mechanism .",
    "however , it has been claimed that the low @xmath50 estimates might be due to projection and/or radiation pressure effects , while the optical classification of the galaxy hosting these objects is not clear .    in this letter , we presented near - ir data of the @xmath0-ray - emitting nlsy1 galaxy fbqs j1644@xmath32619 , which were collected in the @xmath26 band at the gtc with circe .",
    "the aim was to establish the morphology of its host galaxy and to make a reliable estimate of its bh mass .",
    "the 2d surface brightness profile of the host galaxy of fbqs j1644@xmath32619 is well described by an unresolved nuclear component and a single bulge component with a srsic profile with index @xmath4 = 3.7 , assessing an early - type galaxy profile .",
    "the bh mass estimated by the ir bulge luminosity is ( 2.1 @xmath5 0.2 ) @xmath29 10@xmath10 m@xmath2 .",
    "all these pieces of evidence indicate that the relativistic jet in this nlsy1 is produced by a massive bh hosted in an elliptical galaxy with @xmath66 m@xmath18 , in agreement with the other radio - loud agn .",

    "<S> the discovery of @xmath0-ray emission from radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nlsy1 ) galaxies has questioned the need for large black hole masses ( @xmath1 m@xmath2 ) to launch relativistic jets . </S>",
    "<S> we present near - infrared data of the @xmath0-ray - emitting nlsy1 fbqs j1644@xmath32619 that were collected using the camera circe ( canarias infrared camera experiment ) at the 10.4-m gran telescopio canarias to investigate the structural properties of its host galaxy and to infer the black hole mass . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d surface brightness profile is modelled by the combination of a nuclear and a bulge component with a srsic profile with index @xmath4 = 3.7 , indicative of an elliptical galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the structural parameters of the host are consistent with the correlations of effective radius and surface brightness against absolute magnitude measured for elliptical galaxies . from the bulge luminosity , we estimated a black hole mass of ( 2.1 @xmath5 0.2)@xmath6m@xmath2 , consistent with the values characterizing radio - loud active galactic nuclei .    </S>",
