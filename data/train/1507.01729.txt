    "economic markets grew in size and became intertwined during the last decades in an unprecedented fashion .",
    "the evolution of economic markets not only caused the change in magnitude of connections but also a change in the structure of the markets and their connections . with this surge , the importance of evaluation of connections among different parts of markets grew , and understanding financial and macroeconomic connectedness became central to many areas of research as risk management , portfolio allocation , and business - cycle analysis .",
    "academics being painfully aware of the unsuitability of the standard correlation - based measures have concentrated on the development of more general frameworks while overlooking the actual sources of connectedness . in this work",
    ", we argue that it is crucial to understand the frequency dynamics of the connectedness as shocks to economic activity impact variables at different frequencies with different strength . to consider the long - term , medium - term , and short - term frequency responses of shocks , we propose a general framework which will allow us to measure the connectedness of economic variables at frequency bands of interest .    the distinction between short - term and long - term parts of systems became evident with the dawn of co - integration @xcite",
    ". assuming and levering co - integration in the system , subsequent literature builds a preliminary notion of disentangling frequencies in connectedness @xcite .",
    "given the decomposition to the long - term common stochastic trend and deviations from trend , one can move the projection in such a way that error to one series will be a shock to long - term trend and the other will be a shock to the deviation from the trend .",
    "a shock with strong long - run effect will have high power at low frequencies and in case it transmits to other variables , it points to long - run connectedness .",
    "for example , in case of stock markets , low frequency spillovers may be attributed to permanent changes in expectations about future dividends @xcite . while low frequency spillovers are documented by the literature , connectedness at business cycles , or even higher frequencies",
    "hence , we address this call by proposing a general framework for decomposing the connectedness to the frequency band of interest . similarly to @xcite , who set asset pricing into the frequency domain , we view the frequency domain as a natural place for measuring the connectedness between economic variables .    as noted by @xcite , and later @xcite , variance decompositions from approximating models are convenient framework for empirical measurement of connectedness .",
    "precisely , @xcite define the measures based on assessing shares of forecast error variation in one variable due to shock arising in another variable in the system . to identify uncorrelated structural shocks from correlated reduced - form shocks , @xcite use the generalized variance decomposition of @xcite , which moreover allows to define directional connectedness .",
    "this approach quickly became popular and recognized by researchers due to its universality .",
    "being interested in frequency origins of connectedness in variables , one may think about using different forecast horizons of variance decomposition .",
    "staying in time domain , heterogeneous frequency responses of shocks impacting future uncertainty with different strength will stay hidden , as the effects are simply aggregated through frequencies . to see this ,",
    "let us consider two examples of bivariate autoregressive process with opposite signs of coefficients .",
    "the positive coefficients in the first example will create large connectedness driven by low frequencies of the cross - spectral density . with increasing forecast horizon of variance decompositions ,",
    "one will measure higher connectedness in the process . in the second example , the negative coefficients of the same magnitude will create equal connectedness as in the first case at all forecasting horizons , although connections come solely from the high frequencies due to anti - persistent nature of the process .    instead of assessing shares of forecast error variation in a variable due to shock arising in another variable ,",
    "we are hence interested in assessing shares of forecast error variation in a variable at a specific frequency .",
    "this is a natural step to take , as it will show the long - term , medium - term , and short - term impacts of a shock , which can conveniently be summed to total aggregate effect , if needed . for the purpose of frequency",
    "dependent measurement , we define spectral representation of generalized forecast error variance decomposition . instead of impulse responses of the shocks , we work with its fourier transforms  frequency responses . in the frequency domain , we are simply interested in the portion of forecast error variance at a given frequency that is attributed to shocks in another variable .",
    "our work is inspired by previous research of @xcite , and @xcite who use related measures in more restrictive environments .",
    "our spectral representations are useful if we work with stationary data , though , economic time series are often of nonstationary nature .",
    "most prolific example is cointegrated data , which share common stochastic trends commonly expressed as linear combination of the shocks of a system . in words of @xcite : _ `` economic data are cointegrated because they respond to shocks together . '' _ common stochastic trends makes it even more difficult to understand how the system is connected at various horizons as connections are dominated by the strong relationship . with careful treatment",
    ", we extend our notion of frequency dependent measurement of connectedness also to case when data share common stochastic trends and make possible measurement of true business cycles connections .",
    "in addition to introducing the frequency dynamics into the measurement of connectedness and considering important cointegrating dynamics , we also study how cross - sectional correlations impact the connectedness .",
    "higher contemporaneous correlation do not necessarily need to indicate connectedness in a sense literature tries to measure it .",
    "a good example is recent crisis of 20072008 , when stock markets recorded strong cross - sectional correlations biasing the contagion effects estimated by many researchers @xcite .",
    "the theoretical discussion is followed by two relevant applications on financial and macroeconomic data that help us to show the usefulness of the framework and guide a user to apply the introduced methods appropriately in different situations . in the first application , we study an important problem of connectedness of market risk .",
    "we use the spectral representations of variance decompositions locally to recover the time - frequency dynamics of connectedness in the us stock market , and we document rich dynamics in frequency responses of shocks in volatilities .",
    "dynamics of connectedness is mainly driven by frequencies from one day up to one month , although this does not hold in the period of turmoils with increased level of uncertainty . in these periods the total connectedness increases , and the increase is mainly due to short - term contemporaneous correlations , as well as causal longer term connectedness .    in the second application ,",
    "we attempt to measure connectedness of industrial production in g-7 countries at business cycles frequencies .",
    "motivated by the work of @xcite who find transmission of shocks to occur gradually with increasing horizons in variance decompositions on similar data , we address the problem with spectral representations .",
    "common shocks driving business cycles , which are confirmed by literature @xcite will dominate the variance decompositions with its strong frequency responses . especially when measuring directional connectedness , effects of common shocks make it difficult to see the directions of connectedness at business cycles .",
    "controlling for these permanent shocks , we measure connectedness at business cycles as commonly defined in the literature , and document frequency dependent connectedness due to shocks with different frequency responses in data .",
    "as argued by @xcite , variance decompositions can intuitively be used for measurement of connectedness between economic variables . a natural way",
    "to measure its frequency dynamics is to consider the spectral representation of variance decompositions based on frequency , instead of impulse responses of shocks .",
    "frequency domain being natural place to study the long - run , medium - run , or short - run connectedness shifts our focus from assessing share of variances due to shocks to assessing share of spectra . @xcite introduced a first notion of spectral representation for variance decompositions , although in restrictive setting . in our work , we define general spectral representation of variance decompositions , and show how we can use them for defining the frequency dependent connectedness measures .    the spectral representations of variance decompositions can also be viewed as more general way of measuring causality in frequency domain .",
    "@xcite proposes a frequency domain decomposition of the usual likelihood ratio test statistic for granger causality , and @xcite provide a formal framework for testing causality on various frequencies .",
    "@xcite develop a multivariate extensions , but all the analysis is done using partial cross - spectra and is therefore silent on indirect causality chains .",
    "hence , this part of literature is also part of our motivation to propose a more general framework .    before defining the connectedness measures in frequency domain",
    ", we briefly discuss the notion of measuring connectedness introduced by @xcite using the generalized forecast error variance decompositions ( gfevd ) , as we build on these ideas in frequency domain later in the text .",
    "an intuitive way to measure the connectedness between variables is to consider vector auto - regression ( var ) estimates and its forecast error variance decomposition ( fevd ) .",
    "formally , let us have the @xmath0-variate process @xmath1 described by the structural var(@xmath2 ) at @xmath3 as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is @xmath6 @xmath2-th order lag - polynomial and @xmath7 is white - noise generated by ( possibly non - diagonal ) covariance matrix @xmath8 .",
    "assuming that the roots of @xmath9 lie outside the unit - circle , the var process has following ma(@xmath10 ) representation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an @xmath6 infinite lag polynomial matrix of coefficients .",
    "the usual fevd derived directly from impulse responses of the system does not have straightforward interpretation as the shocks to variables are not identified . a shock to variable @xmath13",
    "does not necessarily appear alone , or orthogonally , to shocks to other variables .",
    "hence , to identify the shocks and derive meaningful fevd we need to employ some identification scheme . @xcite use the standard sims recursive identification where the errors are standardized by cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix .",
    "the standardization matrix from cholesky decomposition , however , depends on the ordering of the variables in the var system implying dependence of any measures devised using this identification scheme on reordering of variables . for this reason , @xcite use the generalized var setting @xcite that mitigates the issue by imposing additional assumption of normality of the shocks",
    ". additional convenient feature of this identification scheme is possibility to consider a directional connectedness measures . in our work",
    ", we stay within the generalized framework , although the spectral representation can be analogously defined to any other identification scheme and approximating model . with this respect the next sections present general results .",
    "generalized fevd can be written in the form denotes the @xmath13th row and @xmath14th column of matrix @xmath15 denoted in bold .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the full @xmath13th row , likewise for columns . ]",
    "( for detailed derivation of the formula see appendix  [ app : genfevd ] ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a @xmath6 matrix of coefficients corresponding to lag @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21 denotes the contribution of the @xmath14th variable of the system to the variance of forecast error of the element @xmath13 .",
    "due to one of the notable implications of the generalized var framework the effects do not add up to one within columns by definition . to standardize the effects",
    "we define @xmath22    the connectedness measure is then defined as the share of variances in the forecasts contributed by other than own errors , or equally as ratio of the sum of the off - diagonal elements to sum of the whole matrix @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the trace operator . hence , the connectedness is the relative contribution to the forecast variances from the other variables in the system . note that although @xmath25 measures connectedness of whole system , directional connectedness measures can be conveniently defined within this framework .",
    "we will return to their definition later , already using frequency decompositions .",
    "generalized forecast error variance decompositions ( gfevd ) are central to measuring connectedness , hence to define frequency dependent measures , we need to consider its spectral counterpart .",
    "as can be noted from equation  [ eq : connectedness ] connectedness measure is based on impulse response functions @xmath26 defined in time domain . as a building block of the presented theory",
    ", we consider a frequency response function , @xmath27 , which can be simply obtained from fourier transform of the coefficients @xmath28 , with @xmath29 . a spectral density of @xmath30 at frequency @xmath31",
    "can then be conveniently defined as a fourier transform of ma(@xmath10 ) filtered series as @xmath32 the power spectrum @xmath33 describes how the variance of the @xmath30 is distributed over the frequency components @xmath31 . using the spectral representation for covariance ,",
    "i.e. @xmath34 , following definition naturally introduces the frequency domain counterparts of variance decomposition .",
    "generalized causation spectrum over frequencies @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath27 is the fourier transform of the impulse response @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath37 represents the portion of the spectrum of @xmath13th variable at frequency @xmath31 due to shocks in @xmath14th variable . in a sense",
    ", we can interpret the quantity as a within frequency causation , as denominator holds spectrum of the @xmath13th variable ( on - diagonal element of cross - spectral density of @xmath30 ) at given frequency @xmath31 .",
    "based on this notion , we will define a within frequency connectedness measures .",
    "the _ generalized causation spectrum _ can also be related to standard coherence measure , but only one way relation is taken into account in here .",
    "thus the word _ causation _ as introduced in @xcite is justified , as the weighing by respective variances and covariances brings restriction and identification assumptions of the generalized var and hence we can interpret the measure causally within the validity of the invoked assumptions on the system .",
    "the quantity we consider is different from that of @xcite , which is reflected in the word _",
    "generalized_.    to obtain a natural decomposition of original gfevd to frequencies , we can simply weight the @xmath38 by the frequency share of variance of the @xmath13 variable . the weighting function can be defined as @xmath39 and represents the power of @xmath13th variable at given frequency , which sums through frequencies to a constant value of @xmath40 .",
    "note that while the fourier transform of the impulse response is in general a complex valued quantity , the generalized causation spectrum is the squared modulus of the weighted complex numbers , hence producing a real quantity .",
    "the following proposition formalizes the discussion , and is central to the development of the connectedness measures in frequency domain .",
    "[ prop:1 ] suppose @xmath41 is wide - sense stationary with @xmath42 then @xmath43    see appendix .",
    "proposition [ prop:1 ] defines the decomposition of gfevd in the frequency domain .",
    "gfevd at @xmath44 can then be viewed as weighted average of the generalized causation spectrum @xmath37 that gives us the strength of the relationship on given frequency weighted by power of the series on the given frequency .",
    "the integral over admissible frequencies reconstructs perfectly the theoretical value of original @xmath45 .",
    "the proposition is not only important theoretical result , but it also reminds us that when measuring connectedness with @xmath46 in time domain , we are looking at information aggregated through frequencies ignoring heterogeneous frequency responses of shocks .",
    "it is also important to note that effects at the whole range of frequencies influence @xmath45 , which is an important observation when one interprets the measures defined using the spectral representation .    in economic applications , we are interested in assessing the short - term , medium - term , or long - term connectedness rather than connectedness at a given frequency in most of the cases . hence , it is more convenient to work with frequency bands , which can be arbitrarily chosen . for this purpose ,",
    "we define the amount of forecast error variance created on an arbitrarily chosen set of frequencies . the quantity is then given by integrating only over the desired frequencies @xmath47 .",
    "formally , let us have a frequency band @xmath48 the generalised fevd on some frequency band @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50    because the introduced relationship is an identity and the integral is linear operator , sum over disjoint intervals covering the whole range @xmath51 will recover the original gfevd . following remark formalizes the fact .",
    "[ rem : recomposition ] denote by @xmath52 an interval on the real line from the set of intervals @xmath53 that form a partition of the interval @xmath51 , such that @xmath54 and @xmath55 . due to the linearity of integral and the construction of @xmath52 we have @xmath56    using the spectral representation of gfevd , it is straightforward to define connectedness measures on a given frequency band .",
    "[ def : freqmeasures ] let us define scaled gfevd on the frequency band @xmath57 as @xmath58    * the frequency connectedness on the frequency band @xmath49 is then defined as @xmath59 * the within connectedness on the frequency band @xmath49 is then defined as @xmath60    the definition [ def : freqmeasures ] works with two notions : the _ frequency connectedness _ and the _ within connectedness_. the _ within connectedness _ gives us the connectedness effect that happens within the frequency band and is weighted by the power of the series on the given frequency band exclusively .",
    "on the other hand the _ frequency connectedness _ decomposes the original connectedness into distinct parts that in sum give the original connectedness measure @xmath61 .",
    "following remark formalize the notion of reconstruction of the connectedness .",
    "[ prop:2 ] denote by @xmath52 an interval on the real line from the set of intervals @xmath53 that form a partition of the interval @xmath51 , such that @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we then have that @xmath62    see appendix .    to illustrate the difference between the frequency and within connectedness",
    ", remember that the typical spectral shape of economic variables has the most power concentrated on low frequencies ( long - term movements or trend ) .",
    "hence , we could decompose the connectedness into two parts , the one that covers long - term movements and the one that covers the short - term movements .",
    "suppose that 90% of the spectral density is concentrated in the long - term movements .",
    "now , suppose that the connectedness on high frequencies is high , say 80 , and low on long - term , say 10 .",
    "these numbers represent the within connectedness .",
    "the total connectedness will be much closer to 10 , because the short - term connectedness of size 80 will be down weighted by the very low amount of spectral density on the short - term .",
    "otherwise said , even thought the short - term activities are very connected because not much happens in terms of the system activity on the short - term , this connection becomes negligible in the system connectedness .",
    "this can be seen clearly in the simulations in the following section .",
    "the concepts of within and frequency connectedness coincide when whole frequency band @xmath63 is considered .",
    "this is formalized by the following remark .",
    "[ prop:3 ] let us have @xmath63 .",
    "we then have @xmath64    see appendix .",
    "the previous theory is devised in terms of theoretical quantities and the method of estimation deserves to follow .",
    "primarily , the standard var framework is not the only way how to obtain the estimates of the behavior of the system .",
    "more advanced and often more suited approaches can be devised .",
    "@xcite use vector error correction model ( vecm ) to obtain approximation of the behavior .",
    "estimators that use shrinkage or bayesian approaches might be a viable alternative in many cases . in our applications , we restrict ourselves to use of the standard var and vecm frameworks and leave other methods for future investigation .",
    "having the estimates , two main issues remain .",
    "the first is the approximation of the ma(@xmath10 ) representation of the series and the second is the estimation of the theoretical spectral densities .",
    "the ma(@xmath10 ) representation is used to compute the forecast error variance decomposition that relates percentage of mean squared error ( mse ) of forecasts of variable @xmath14 due to shocks to variable @xmath13 . because the computation of these theoretical quantities is based on an infinite process",
    ", we make it feasible by a finite ma(@xmath65 ) approximation .",
    "this is possible mainly due to the fact that if the system is stable , there must exist @xmath65 , such that @xmath66 meaning that the error due to approximation disappears with growing @xmath65 .",
    "reverse would mean that innovations would have permanent impact .",
    "hence , we can in principle use two ways to approximate the decomposition .",
    "first , we can use an ad hoc selected @xmath65 that is beyond doubt high enough . or second , we can use a measure of similarity of matrices to choose the appropriate @xmath65 during the approximation .",
    "the @xmath67 coefficients are then computed through standard recursive scheme @xmath68 where @xmath2 is the order of var and @xmath69 . here",
    "we note that by studying the quantities in the frequency domain , @xmath65 serves only as an approximation factor , and have no interpretation as in the time domain . in the applications , we advice to set the @xmath65 high enough to obtain better approximation of the quantities at all frequencies , especially when small frequency bands are of interest .    secondly , the spectral quantities are estimated using standard discrete fourier transforms .",
    "the following definition specifies accurately the used estimates of the quantities .",
    "the cross - spectral density on the interval @xmath70 @xmath71 is estimated as follows @xmath72 for @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the decomposition of the impulse response function at the given frequency band is then estimated as @xmath76    using this definition the estimate of the generalized causation spectrum over the interval @xmath49 is then defined as follows @xmath77 by employing the estimate of weighting function @xmath78 we estimate the decomposed gfevd to a frequency band as @xmath79    then the connectedness measures @xmath80 and @xmath81 at a given frequency band of interest can be readily derived by plugging the @xmath82 estimate into the definition  [ def : freqmeasures ] .",
    "spectral representations from previous sections hold if we work with stationary processes",
    ". however , in many cases the economic variables we study are nonstationary @xmath83 processes exhibiting systemic variation . for an @xmath83 process , @xmath84",
    ", i.e. the infinite sum of the coefficients is infinite .",
    "the source of integration can either be a deterministic trend or non - stationarity driven through the coefficients . in the first case of the deterministic trend , it is important to take it into account while modelling the system ( by inclusion of deterministic trend ) and if done properly the analysis of gfevd is the same as in the case of the stationary processes because the trend does not enter the impulse response functions that become stationary . in the second case , where the integration is driven through the stochastic processes one has to think further about the strategy for estimating connectedness .",
    "most prolific example of such system in economics is the cointegrated process .",
    "therefore , let us have system defined by @xmath85 where @xmath86 are matrices of size @xmath87 holding the loadings and cointegration vectors respectively , @xmath88 are matrices of size @xmath6 holding the short - run coefficients , and @xmath89 is white - noise generated by ( possibly non - diagonal ) covariance matrix @xmath8 . by simple manipulation a var(p+1 ) representation of the system",
    "can be derived @xmath90 such that @xmath91 has determinant zero and rank equal to @xmath92 . in the covariance stationary case , the impulse responses that are needed for our analysis conveniently correspond to the ma representation of the process .",
    "the integrated processes however do not possess valid ma representation . though unorthogonalized impulse response functions can readily be computed recursively in the same fashion as in the case of the stable var system providing us with the matrix @xmath12 where the individual elements hold the unorthogonalized impulse responses in form of the lag polynomials .",
    "this familiar notation , yet non - standard , eases the exposition .    with careful treatment",
    ", one can think about further extending the ideas presented earlier to nonstationary cases .",
    "the main issue one needs to deal with is that unconditional gfevd will be dominated by information at the zero frequency , as frequency response of common shocks will have very high power at zero frequency .",
    "the information at remaining frequencies will be shadowed as the limit of spectrum of the cointegrated process at zero frequency is infinite , @xmath93 , giving the remaining frequencies zero weight @xmath94 in computation of @xmath95 . even in this case ,",
    "definition of @xmath38 is meaningful , as it shows relative influence of shocks on frequency components of variation .",
    "intuitively , gfevd will be created solely by long - run variance at zero frequency , as unconditionally the relative contribution of other frequencies are negligible in terms of their variance . letting @xmath96 exist and noting the quantities are symmetric around zero frequency in @xmath97 $ ] domain , the following proposition formalizes this notion .",
    "[ prop:4 ] suppose @xmath41 is a cointegrated system defined by equation  [ def : vecm ] .",
    "then @xmath98 for all @xmath99 such that @xmath100 .",
    "see the proof in appendix    the proposition states that measuring connectedness of cointegrated processes including zero frequency results in measuring the effects of shocks to common stochastic trends ( first integral from proposition [ prop:4 ] ) and ignores the connection at other than zero frequencies ( as second integral from proposition [ prop:4 ] is zero ) .",
    "hence the measure neglects possible connections at remaining frequencies which are of high importance during the move to new equilibrium in the system .",
    "such frequencies are of great interest in studying business cycless connectedness , as will be argued in the next sections .    to measure these connections at business cycle frequencies , we adjust the measure to only take into account the variance and connection contributions at frequencies excluding zero .",
    "the following definition formalizes the measure .",
    "[ def:4 ] suppose @xmath41 is a cointegrated system defined by equation  [ def : vecm ]",
    ". then @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath99 is arbitrarily small .",
    "importantly , we have to note that the causation spectrum remains unchanged but is weighted by different weights .",
    "we deliberately choose to use the notation @xmath103 to stress the difference from the traditional gfevd denoted by @xmath104 . using the measure @xmath103 on the domain",
    "@xmath105 we can define all the remaining measures of connectedness from previous sections readily .",
    "in essence , the approach of removing the zero frequency from the measures is equivalent to applying an ideal filter to the series . to illustrate this ,",

    "this is also important part to understand when interpreting estimates .",
    "weighting without zero frequency implies that @xmath117 will be different from @xmath118 causing that these measures will not be directly comparable to full variance decompositions of the system in relative terms .",
    "a natural question arises why we proceed by removing the zero frequency but not filtering the series by appropriate filter and computing the standard connectedness measures , which might seem more natural ? applying univariate filters to the series and then modeling them as a system might introduce spurious correlations between the series due to cyclical properties of filters @xcite .",
    "the problem might be mitigated to some extend , but can not be eradicated due to the nature of the problem , as we always approximate an ideal filter with some error .",
    "although theoretically same approaches , proper statistical modeling with removal of the connection at zero frequencies is superior to applying filters to the series and computing the connectedness measures to the filtered series .",
    "to motivate the usefulness of the proposed measures , we study the processes that generate frequency dependent connectedness by simulations .",
    "we look at connectedness that are induced through cross - sectional correlations or interactions between bivariate autoregressive ( ar ) processes .",
    "we illustrate the emergence of connectedness and their spectral footprints through change in coefficients in the simplest bivariate var(1 ) case .",
    "suppose the simplest case that nevertheless illustrates the mechanics generating the data from the following equations @xmath119 where @xmath120 with @xmath121    by altering the true coefficients generating the data , we study several cases with known values of theoretical connectedness estimates .",
    "we start with a symmetric processes with @xmath122 with three important cases generating distinctly connected variables @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "first case is the @xmath125 , when we have two independent processes , which have connectedness zero at all frequencies .",
    "secondly , we study the connectedness of two symmetrically connected ar processes with the parameter @xmath126 and @xmath127 or @xmath128 and @xmath129 generating equal total connectedness with different sources from low and high frequencies of cross - spectral densities for positive and negative values of coefficients respectively .",
    "in addition to motivating the importance of frequency dynamics of connectedness , we also show the importance of cross - sectional correlations , which translates to all frequencies , and may bias the connectedness measures .",
    "hence for all cases , we consider two extremes of cross - sectional dependence : no correlation @xmath130 and correlation of @xmath131 .",
    "to show how the cross - sectional correlations impact the connectedness measures , we compute the measures with additional step in estimation , considering only diagonals of the covariance matrix of residuals , hence removing the cross - sectional dependence . in this way , we disentangle the influence of correlations from the true dynamics . in the text we always present only the estimates on the simulated data , and save the true values of measures in the table  [ tab : trueparams ] in the appendix .    .simulation results .",
