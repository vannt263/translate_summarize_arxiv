    "massive black holes ( mbhs ) detected in the centers of many nearby galaxies ( kormendy and richstone 1995 , kormendy & gebhardt ( 2002 ) ) show an approximately linear relation with the luminosity of the host bulge , inferring the black hole mass is 0.001 - 0.002 of the bulge .",
    "in addition to those mbhs detected by techniques of stellar and gas kinematics , the masses of about three dozen mbhs in agns have been estimated by reverberation mapping of the broad emission - line region .",
    "high quality reverberation data and virial bh mass estimates are presently available for 20 seyfert 1 nuclei ( wandel , peterson and malkan 1999 , hereafter wpm ) and 17 pg quasars ( kaspi 2000 ) , recently reanalysed by peterson et al .",
    "the virial estimate has been shown to be consistent with the real bh mass ( peterson & wandel 1999 ; 2000 ) .",
    "previous work suggested that mbhs of active galactic nuclei ( seyfert galaxies and quasars ) follow a similar relation ( laor 1998 ; ho 1999 ; wandel 1999 ) .",
    "new and updated data for agn confirm that agns and quiescent galaxies have the same bh - bulge mass relation ( wandel 2002 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ) .",
    "several authors suggested that narrow line seyfert 1s have lower mbh / bulge ratios ( wandel 1999;2002 ; mathur kuraskiewicz and czerny 2001 , gruppe and mathur 2003 ) however botte ( 2004 ) find in a different sample that nls1s have the same bh - bulge relation as broad line agns . ferrarese and merritt ( 2000 ) and gebhardt ( 2000a ) have found that mbh masses of inactive galaxies are better correlated with the stellar velocity dispersion in the bulge than with the bulge luminosity .",
    "apparently this relation holds also for agns : the few seyfert galaxies with stellar velocity data and reverberation bh mass estimates seem to be consistent with the bh - velocity dispersion relation of inactive galaxies ( gebhardt 2000b ) , a conclusion strengthened by observations of the velocity dispersion in mapped seyfert galaxies ( ferrarese 2001 ) .",
    "we reexamine the bh - bulge mass relation of agns . we combine new and updated data to yield a data base of 55 agns ( 28 quasars , 18 seyfert 1 galaxies and 9 narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars ) .",
    "most of these objects have mapping masses and almost all of them have the bulge luminosity measured directly by using bulge / disk decomposition ( mclure & dunlop 2001 ) . our results ( figure [ fig1 ] )",
    "reconfirm that broad - line agns follow the same bh - bulge relation as ordinary ( inactive ) galaxies , while narrow line agns have significantly lower bh / bulge mass ratios ( wandel 2002 ) .",
    "we find that broad line agns have an average black hole / bulge mass fraction of @xmath0 with a strong correlation ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this bh - bulge relation is consistent with the bh - bulge relation of quiescent galaxies and tighter than previous results ( cf . marconi and hunt 2003 ) narrow line agns ( narrow line seyfert 1s and quasars , defined by permitted lines narrower than 2000km / s ) appear to have a lower bh / bulge ratio , @xmath2",
    ".    the lower bh / bulge ratio of narrow line agns may indicate that nls1s have relatively smaller masses .",
    "one way to check this possibility is the @xmath3 relation , but it appears that the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies with measured stellar velocity dispersion have similar @xmath3 ratios as broad line agns and quiescent galaxies ( fig 4 ) .",
    "the lower bh / bulge ratios of narrow - line agn seems to be part of a continous trend : we find that the @xmath4 ratio in agn is strongly correlated with the emission - line width , @xmath5    this tight correlation may be related to the virial mass calculation @xmath6 but given the bh - bulge relation , we expect @xmath4 to be constant rather than strongly dependent on @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , combining the new relation with the virial relation we expect the dependence on the line width ( @xmath8 ) to cancel and leave a scattered distribution .",
    "rather , we find a new , strong nearly linear relation : a very tight correlation between bulge luminosity and blr size ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "the best fit of this correlation for all our sample is @xmath9 with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 .",
    "this is a non trivial correlation , as it relates two independent observables : the bulge luminosity , a global galactic property on a scale of kpc , and the distance of the line - emitting ionized gas from the central continuum source - the broad line region ( blr ) size on a scale of few light days .",
    "a possible explanation to this correlation may be as follows : it is known that the blr radius scales with the agn luminosity and the luminosity scales with the accretion rate .",
    "if the accretion rate is determined by the bulge size , the blr size could be related to the bulge size . however , in the blr - lbulge relation narrow line agns do not seem to have a different scaling than broad line agns .",
    "this may indicate that the emission lines of nlans appear narrowas a result of an inclination effect , for example , if the blr has a flattened geometry and is viewed nearly edge on .",
    "we find that in agns with `` narrow '' boad lines the /bulge ratio seems to be systematically smaller than in broad line agns and in normal galaxies .",
    "is this the case also for the @xmath10 relation ?",
    "the bulge velocity dispersion is measured for only 11 seyfert galaxies , of which four ( mrk 110 , mrk 590 , 3c120 and ngc 4051 ) can be classified as narrow line seyfert 1s .    in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "the bh mass is plotted against the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "we see that broad line agns are consistent with the @xmath11 relation of inactive galaxies ( @xmath12 , with @xmath13 ; gebhardt 2000a ; merritt and ferrarese 2001a ) the narrow line seyfert 1s with measured @xmath14 denoted by solid pink squares in figure [ fig4 ] ) seem to follow the same @xmath11 relation of quiescent galaxies and broad line seyferts .    for agns without a direct velocity dispersion measurement",
    "the relation between the narrow line width and the velocity dispersion ( nelson 2000;botte ) may be used to estimate the velocity dispersion in the bulge .",
    "interestingly , a tight linear relation seems to exist between virial mass given by the narrow [ oiii ] line and the bh mass in seyfert galaxies ( wandel and mushotzky 1986 ) .",
    "here we use a different method to estimate the velocity dispersion - the faber - jackson ( f - j ) relation , which is applicable for agns with measured or estimated bulge luminosity . the `` standard '' f",
    "- j relation is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a luminosity coefficient determined by a linear fit with a slope of 4 to those seyfert galaxies in our sample which have measured stellar velocity dispersion , which gives @xmath18 . note that most narrow line agns added in this manner ( open pink squares in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) do not have lower bh masses than the value expected from the @xmath19 relation",
    "we show that narrow - line agns have lower @xmath20 ratio than broad line agns , and find a strong correlation between this ratio and the broad emission - line width .",
    "however , in the @xmath21 relation narrow line agns seem to be similar to broad line agns .",
