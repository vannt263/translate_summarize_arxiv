    "quantum state engineering ( qse ) based on superconducting josephson circuits ( sjcs )  @xcite has been stimulated by the encouraging prospects of quantum computing ( qc ) and quantum information processing ( qip )  .",
    "the sjcs include the charge-  @xcite , flux-  , and phase qubits   as well as their variants  .",
    "moreover , qse with sjcs is also a crucial approach to investigate the fundamental quantum phenomena , such as geometric phase  @xcite and non - locality  .",
    "note that most of the current experiments for qse employ the technique that is sensitive to the exact design of the applied pulses .",
    "a typical example is that the so - called @xmath0-pulse is usually exactly designed to transfer the population from one quantum state to another .",
    "however , these duration - sensitive operations might not be practically the most optimal approaches to implement the desirable quantum manipulations with sufficiently - high fidelity and efficiency .    besides the exactly - designed pulse operations , adiabatic passage ( ap ) technique developed in atomic physics is also an efficient strategy for quantum - state control .",
    "this technique possesses certain significant advantages , such as high transfer efficiency , robustness to environment noises , and less limits on the designs of the operational pulses .",
    "it is well - known that the main aps include such as the stimulated raman ap ( stirap )  @xcite , stark chirped rapid ap ( scrap )  , and piecewise ap ( pap )  @xcite , etc .. certainly , all of these methods are competent for various population transfers .",
    "but , certain limits still exist in these aps . for example",
    ", stiraps are not immune to the induced ac stark shifts  @xcite . also , pap demonstrated in recent experiments still needs a series of ultrafast pulses to simultaneously control the switches of two pulses and phase holdings .",
    "this further requires the superb operating techniques .",
    "in contrast , scrap realized in the recent experiment  @xcite only needs relevant controls on the amplitudes of pulses and thus could be immune to the inhomogeneous level broadening .",
    "ap technique has also been used in sjcs for various applications , ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the stirap technique was utilized to prepare fock state  @xcite of a nanomechanical oscillator coupled to a cooper - pair box , two - qubit and three - qubit entangled states in coupled josephson flux circuits were proposed  @xcite , etc .. in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite we proposed an effective approach , by using the scrap technique , to implement the fundamental logic gates without precisely designing the durations of the operations . in this paper , we further generalize such an idea to implement the qse with flux - biased josephson circuits , including the single - qubit phase shift and also the @xmath1-rotation operation , as well as the two - qubit iswap gate .",
    "our basic idea is to introduce a controllable flux - perturbation to chirp the transition frequency of a selected flux - biased qubit .",
    "then , by properly controlling the amplitude ratio of perturbation to the transition driving , desirable population transfers between the selected quantum states could be achieved with sufficiently - high efficiency .",
    "based on these operations , various single- and two - qubit logic gates in these sjcs could be implemented without exactly designing the durations of the applied adiabatic pulses .",
    "furthermore , arbitrary superposition of the logic states could also been implemented , in principle . given the flux - biased josephson phase qubits and their manipulations",
    "have already been demonstrated , the present proposal should be experimentally feasible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief review of the usual @xmath0-pulse coherent excitation , and the scrap technique used in atomic physics is also included .",
    "subsequently , we give a simple description of the flux - biased phase qubit , a detailed approach for population adiabatic transfers , as well as controllable construction of superposition state . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss how to implement the two - qubit gate with capacitively - coupled flux - biased phase qubits by the proposed scrap technique .",
    "finally , conclusions and discussions are given in sec .",
    "two - level system is a fundamental model in quantum physics . in qip the basic information element ( i.e. , qubit )",
    "is encoded by a well - defined two - level system .",
    "there are many approaches to implement the population transfers between the two levels of the qubit .",
    "roughly , these approaches can be classified into the nonadiabatic- and adiabatic passages  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a single qubit driven by an external field can be generally written as ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to the pauli spin operators and @xmath6 the transition frequency of the qubit .",
    "@xmath7 is the driving term with @xmath8 being the pulse frequency and @xmath9 the rabi frequency . here",
    ", @xmath10 is the amplitude of the applied pump pulse , and @xmath11 the matrix element of electric dipole moment .",
    "suppose that the applied pump @xmath12 is resonant with the qubit , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "in the interaction picture , eq .",
    "( [ originalh ] ) reduces to @xmath14 under the usual rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "correspondingly , the solution to the schrdinger equation @xmath15 can be expressed as @xmath16 here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is an unit matrix .",
    "this implies that , if the qubit is initially prepared in the ground state , then at the time @xmath19 the probability for the qubit evolving to the excited state is @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , in order to realize complete population inversion , the pulse area must be precisely designed as @xmath0 .",
    "any deviation from the precise pulse area may result in dynamical error for the desirable population inversion .      for loosening the above rigorous requirement on exactly designing pulse area and improving the operational reliability ,",
    "we add a controllable perturbation to the hamiltonian ( [ originalh ] ) , i.e. , @xmath21 in the interaction picture , the above hamiltonian reduces to @xmath22 note that this hamiltonian is as the same as that in the original scrap scheme  @xcite , wherein the hamiltonian is derived in the schrdinger picture .",
    "also , the pump pulse @xmath23 applied in the present scheme is required to be resonant with the qubit .",
    "certainly , compared with the transition frequency @xmath24 of the qubit , the controllable stark - shift term @xmath25 should be sufficiently small . for convenience , we rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ hintp ] ) as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the instantaneous eigenvalues of the above time - dependent hamiltonian can be straightforwardly written as : @xmath29 with the corresponding eigenvectors ,    @xmath30    @xmath31    in the new hilbert space spanned by the vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the hamiltonian ( [ hintp ] ) reads ( see appendix ) @xmath34 under the adiabatic approximation , @xmath35hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ newh ] ) can be further simplified to @xmath36 the vanished nondiagonal elements denote that there is not any transition between the two instantaneous eigenstates @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that the qubit would passage individually along one of the two adiabatic paths , as long as @xmath39 changes slowly . as a consequence ,",
    "the generic solution of the system takes the form @xmath40 obviously , although the population of an adiabatic state is conservational for no coupling between adiabatic states , the components in the states @xmath41 and @xmath42 can still vary with the time - dependent @xmath39 . in principle , one can realize arbitrary population distributions in @xmath41 and @xmath42 along one selected adiabatic path . as an obvious advantage",
    ", the population transfer presented here is not sensitive to the pulse area .    when the pump pulse is absent , the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hintp ] ) becomes @xmath43 .",
    "this indicates that a stark - chirping pulse is sufficient to produce a phase shift gate @xmath44 with @xmath45 : @xmath46 this is similar to the idea by lowering the potential to implement the fast qubit s readout  @xcite .",
    "this is because that the stark pulse does not destruct the population distributions in the states @xmath41 and @xmath42 , but just leads to the phase accumulations  @xcite . by combining the rabi pulse for transferring the populations between the two levels and the stark pulse for phase shift operation",
    ", one can implement arbitrary superposition of the states @xmath41 and @xmath42 , with controllable probabilities and relative phase .",
    "\\(i ) implement the @xmath1-rotation operation .",
    "we design a pulse sequence shown in fig .  [",
    "singlequbit](a ) : apply only the stark pulse at the first for satisfying the initial condition @xmath47 ; and then a pump pulse is applied but it switches off prior to stark pulse for satisfying the condition @xmath48 .",
    "this pulse sequence yields the following population inversion @xmath49 along the adiabatic paths @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "if the qubit resides in @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) originally , it would evolve to the state @xmath42 ( or @xmath41 ) along the adiabatic path @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 ) . after eliminating the additional phase via a phase - shift gate operation @xmath52 described above",
    ", one can realize single - qubit not gate , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "certainly , this implemented process needs to be adiabatic , otherwise the state will evolve along one of the two landau - zener tunneling paths , which suppresses the desirable complete population inversion between the two logic states .",
    "\\(ii ) implement the hadamard gate .",
    "as another example , we set the pulses sequence as ( see fig .  [ singlequbit](b ) ) : stark pulse precedes pump pulse to obtain the initial condition @xmath47 and switches off prior to the pump pulse resulting in @xmath54 .",
    "this means that @xmath55 this is the standard hadamard gate operation .",
    "sjcs provide a favorable approach to implement qc due to its nonlinearity .",

    "certainly , the shape of this potential can be controlled by adjusting the biased current @xmath56 , which indirectly changes magnetic flux though the loop .",
    "the bounded particle moving in the potential would have discrete energy levels .",
    "it is well known that all bound states of natural atoms / molecules have definite parities , and therefore the so - called electric - dipole selection rule determines all the possible transitions between the selected levels .",
    "this rule forbids the transition between the states with the same parity .",
    "however , in certain artificial atoms generated by , e.g. , the present sjcs , the bound states lose the definite parities , and thus the electric - dipole transitions between arbitrary two levels are possible .",
    "this provides a convenient way to design the requirable pulses for implementing the above population transfers .",

    "the difference in our scheme is that the duration of the @xmath0-pulse is not required to be exactly designed , and also the measurement fidelity could be significantly high .",
