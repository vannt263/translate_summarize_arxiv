    "in the last decades , the importance of copulas in mathematical modeling was recognized by many researchers ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "many applications come from actuarial and financial mathematics , where the joint distribution of a vector of random variables is studied frequently .",
    "typical problems are the pricing of basket options or the derivation of the value at risk of a portfolio . in this context , an interesting question concerns the best or worst case when the marginal distributions are given but the dependence structure of the underlying random vector is unknown or only partially known .",
    "such situations appear frequently since dependence structures are in general more difficult to calibrate from empirical data than marginal distributions .",
    "thus we are interested in maximizing the value of an integral by considering all possible copulas as integrators .",
    "+ the underlying problem is in general open , however there exist solutions for some particular classes of integrand functions @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , rapuch and roncalli @xcite consider basket option pricing when no information on the dependence of the underlying random variables is available .",
    "they derive bounds for the prices of several options of european type in the black - scholes model , where the integrand function has a mixed second derivative with constant sign on the unit square .",
    "tankov @xcite extends these results to the greater class of two - increasing ( or supermodular ) functions @xmath0 , a definition will be given in the next section .",
    "furthermore the author gives an extension to option pricing problems under partial information on the dependence of the underlying random variables .",
    "note that the above results are based on classical findings due to tchen @xcite . +",
    "similar results and applications in number theory are presented by fialov and strauch @xcite .",
    "they consider bounds for functionals which depend on two uniformly distributed point sequences . under similar conditions as in @xcite , they show that the frchet - hoeffding bounds @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the copulas for which the extremal values are obtained .",
    "we remark that the underlying problem was formulated as an open problem in the unsolved problem collection of _ uniform distribution theory_. a more detailed introduction to applications in uniform distribution theory is given in section [ udt ] of this article . + a list of results for a different class of functions @xmath0 exists in the context of financial risk theory ; see e.g.  puccetti and rschendorf @xcite or albrecher et al .  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors derive sharp bounds for quantiles of the loss of a portfolio , represented by a finite sum of dependent random variables , when no or only partial information on the dependence structure within the portfolio is available .",
    "such quantities play an important role in actuarial and financial mathematics , for instance in the computation of the value at risk . recently",
    "this approach has been generalized to derive optimal bounds for the expected shortfall of a portfolio ; see puccetti @xcite .",
    "many of these results rely on the so - called rearrangement method due to rschendorf @xcite .",
    "note that the application of the rearrangement method requires a rather strong regularity of the integrand function ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the optimal bounds in the articles mentioned above are attained by using so - called shuffles of @xmath2-class of copulas , which we define in the next section .",
    "+ the structure of our paper is the following : in the next section , after a short introduction to copulas , we present our main results , which are bounds on integrals of piecewise constant functions .",
    "furthermore , we formulate an approximation technique for a very general class of integrand functions . in the third section , we apply our results to problems in uniform distribution theory and financial mathematics .",
    "in the sequel we consider expectations , @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is a function on @xmath4 and @xmath5 are uniformly distributed random variables on the unit interval . in this situation",
    "the joint distribution function @xmath6 of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a copula .",
    "[ cop ] let @xmath6 be a positive function on the unit square",
    ". then @xmath6 is called ( two)-copula iff for every @xmath9 @xmath10 and for every @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14 a function which satisfies is called two - increasing or supermodular . in the sequel",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the set of all two - copulas .    note",
    "that the restriction to uniformly distributed marginals is insignificant since by sklar s theorem , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3.3 ) , we can write every continuous two - dimensional distribution function @xmath16 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 denote the marginal distributions of @xmath16 and @xmath6 is a copula . moreover if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are continuous , then @xmath6 is unique and we have @xmath21 where @xmath22 denote the inverse distribution functions of the marginals .",
    "+ copulas can be ordered stochastically , where the upper and lower bounds are called frchet - hoeffding bounds ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.2.3 ) ) .",
    "more precisely , for every two - copula @xmath6 we have @xmath23 it is also well - known that the frchet - hoeffding lower and upper bounds @xmath24 and @xmath25 are copulas in the two dimensional setting . for higher dimensions",
    "an analogon of exists , however the lower bound is in general not a copula , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 and 3.3 ) . for a detailed introduction to copulas",
    "see @xcite .",
    "+ thus , according to the discussion in the beginning of section [ intro ] , we are interested in bounds of the form @xmath26 for all @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are copulas . as mentioned above a particularly interesting subclass of copulas for our problems",
    "are so - called shuffles of @xmath2 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.2.3 ) .",
    "+    [ shuf ] let @xmath29 , @xmath30 be a partition of the unit interval with @xmath31 , @xmath32 be a permutation of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we define the partition @xmath35 such that each @xmath36 is a square . a copula @xmath6 is called shuffle of @xmath2 with parameters @xmath37 if it is defined in the following way : for all @xmath38 if @xmath39 , then @xmath6 distributes a mass of @xmath40 uniformly spread along the diagonal of @xmath36 and if @xmath41 then @xmath6 distributes a mass of @xmath40 uniformly spread along the antidiagonal of @xmath36 .",
    "note that the two frchet - hoeffding bounds @xmath42 are trivial shuffles of @xmath2 with parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , it is well - known that every copula can be approximated arbitrarily close with respect to the supremum norm by a shuffle of @xmath2 ; see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2.2 ) . in the sequel",
    "we denote by @xmath45 the partition of the unit interval which consists of @xmath46 intervals of equal length .",
    "+ in next theorem we illustrate the close relation of to problems in optimization theory , namely linear assignment problems of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the set of all permutations of @xmath49 .",
    "such problems are well understood and can be solved efficiently , for example by using the celebrated hungarian algorithm due to kuhn @xcite . for a detailed description of assignment problems and related solution algorithms",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "[ main1 ] let @xmath29 , @xmath50 be a real - valued @xmath51 matrix and let the function @xmath0 be defined as @xmath52 then the copula @xmath53 which maximizes @xmath54 is given as a shuffle of @xmath2 with parameters @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the permutation which solves the assignment problem @xmath57 moreover , the maximal value of is given as @xmath58    let @xmath59 be the set of all shuffles of @xmath2 with parameters of the form @xmath60 and let @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "then @xmath63 is always a copula satisfying @xmath64 where @xmath56 is given in the statement of the theorem .",
    "+ for an arbitrary copula @xmath27 we define the matrix @xmath65 as @xmath66 it follows by definition [ cop ] that @xmath65 is doubly stochastic and by definition [ shuf ] that @xmath67 is a permutation matrix .",
    "furthermore it follows by the birkhoff - von neumann theorem that the set of doubly stochastic matrices coincides with the convex hull of the set of permutation matrices , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus for every @xmath6 there exist @xmath68 with @xmath62 such that @xmath69 and hence @xmath70    note that the maximal copula in theorem [ main1 ] is by no means unique , since for instance the value of the integral in is independent of the choice of @xmath71 .",
    "+ obviously , we can derive a lower bound in theorem [ main1 ] by considering @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to see that theorem [ main1 ] applies to all functions @xmath0 which are constant on sets of the form @xmath73 where @xmath31 and @xmath74 are rational numbers .",

    "then @xmath83 for every @xmath46 , and @xmath84    the inequalities in follow immediately from the construction of @xmath85 and theorem [ main1 ] .",

    "perhaps , be relaxed to the case that @xmath0 is @xmath6-continuous a.e .  for all @xmath27 .",
    "this is required to make sure that @xmath92 exists for all @xmath27 .",
    "+ by defining the function families @xmath79 differently , we might get an approximation technique which converges faster to the optimal value , for instance we could use @xmath93 furthermore , the mini- and maximization steps in can be time - consuming , for instance when these problems are not explicitly solvable .",
    "however the advantage of the present approach lies in the fact that we get an upper and lower bound of the optimal value for every @xmath46 , which is obviously useful for numerical applications .",
    "+ in numerical investigations , where could not be solved explicitly , we used mini- and maximization over a fixed grid in each @xmath76 .",
    "this results in a fast computation , however we obviously lose the property of upper and lower bounds for every @xmath46 . + by assuming lipschitz - continuity of @xmath0 , we can describe the rate of convergence of our method .",

    "the involved mini- or maximization of the integrand function on a given grid can be done efficiently , since the integrand functions are piecewise smooth .",
    "a deterministic sequence @xmath100 of points in @xmath101 is called uniformly distributed ( u.d . )",
    "iff @xmath102 for all intervals @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , we call @xmath104 the asymptotic distribution function ( a.d.f . ) of a point sequence @xmath105 in @xmath4 if @xmath106 holds in every point @xmath107 of continuity of @xmath104 , for a survey of classical results in this field see @xcite . in @xcite ,",
