    "let @xmath2 be a compact riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath3 and let @xmath4 be the ( positive ) laplace operator on functions , which in local coordinates is given by @xmath5 here @xmath6 denotes the determinant of the metric tensor and @xmath7 are the components of the dual metric on the cotangent bundle .",
    "this operator is formally self - adjoint on the space of smooth functions with inner product @xmath8 defined by the riemannian measure @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath4 extends to a self - adjoint operator @xmath10 with compact resolvent .",
    "this means there exists an orthonormal basis @xmath11 in @xmath12 consisting of eigenfunctions @xmath13 which we assume to be ordered such that @xmath14 .",
    "it is a classical problem to compute the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the laplace operator on a given manifold .",
    "its solution allows complete control over the functional calculus and thus over solutions to the heat equation , the wave equation , or the schrdinger equation .    in this paper",
    "we show how an adaptation of the method of particular solutions can be used to compute eigenvalues on manifolds with a high accuracy , beyond of what can currently be achieved by finite element methods or boundary element methods .",
    "we will focus primarily on the case of two dimensional oriented surfaces of constant curvature .",
    "these are the simplest examples of manifolds with non - trivial spectral geometry .",
    "they are topologically classified by their genus . by the gauss - bonnet theorem",
    "the curvature @xmath15 of a surface of genus @xmath16 can always be normalized to be @xmath17 by multiplying the metric by a positive constant .",
    "this divides oriented surfaces of constant curvature into three categories    * @xmath18 : up to isometries there is only one such manifold : the round sphere @xmath19 .",
    "the spectrum of the laplace operator on the round sphere is of course well known and the spherical harmonics provide a basis consisting of eigenfunctions . *",
    "@xmath20 : such manifolds are isometric to flat tori which are obtained as quotients of @xmath21 by co - compact lattices .",
    "the moduli space of equivalence classes of flat metrics on a given topological torus is the modular surface @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the upper half space . for a surface",
    "@xmath24 a basis consisting of eigenfunctions is obtained by taking the fourier modes associated with points in the dual lattice @xmath25 and the corresponding eigenvalues are the squares of the norms of these points . * @xmath26 : these are the so called hyperbolic surfaces . they can be obtained either as quotients @xmath27 by co - compact hyperbolic lattices in @xmath28 or by glueing hyperbolic pairs of pants .",
    "the moduli space of hyperbolic metrics on a given topological surface is a quotient of the teichmller space @xmath29 by a discrete group , the mapping class group .",
    "the teichmller space for a genus @xmath16 surface has dimension @xmath30 so that a constant curvature metric on a topological surface may be given by specifying @xmath30 parameters . unlike in the previous two cases the spectrum of the laplace operator of a hyperbolic surface",
    "can not currently be explicitly computed .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to establish an algorithm to compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the laplace operator on a hyperbolic surface up to a certain precision and with mathematically rigorous error bounds . once this is achieved for a number of eigenvalues it is then possible to compute values of the spectral zeta function and the spectral determinant of the laplace operator on such surfaces .",
    "we demonstrate how this can be done using the selberg trace formula in such a way that the error can again be bounded rigorously .",
    "the method we use is adapted to a pants decomposition of the surface . for a particular basis of functions we establish various bounds and estimates that prove that the method of particular solutions can be applied to an interval and yields all eigenvalues in that interval .",
    "in particular we prove a novel estimate that allows us to show non - existence of eigenvalues in a certain interval .      in section [ mps ]",
    "we describe how an adaptation of the method of particular solutions can be applied to manifolds .",
    "the method uses a finite dimensional space of test functions that solve the eigenvalue equation with eigenvalue @xmath31 on open submanifolds that are glued together along co - dimension one hypersurfaces .",
    "the glueing conditions for the eigenfunctions , continuity of the eigenfunctions and their normal derivatives , is measured in terms of the differences of the function values and normal derivatives along the hypersurfaces . for a test function",
    "@xmath32 we introduce in equation ( [ functionaldef ] ) the number @xmath33 that measures these differences in suitable sobolev norms .",
    "we prove that if @xmath34 and @xmath33 is small then @xmath31 must be close to an eigenvalue .",
    "our theorem [ main01 ] together with the subsequent estimates on the constants gives a quantitative version of this statement for hyperbolic surfaces that are glued along geodesic segments .    in section [ sec :",
    "surfaces ] we review the construction of hyperbolic surfaces from pairs of pants .",
    "this gives an explicit parametrization of teichmller space in terms of fenchel - nielsen coordinates and shows that hyperbolic surfaces can be cut open along geodesic segments into pairs of pants and subsequently into subsets of hyperbolic cylinders .    in section [ sec : mps_on_surface ]",
    "we describe a set of basis functions for a surface of genus @xmath16 that is decomposed into pairs of pants .",
    "we prove that true eigenfunctions can be approximated by linear combinations of this set of basis functions with explicit bounds on the error .",
    "section [ algo ] deals with the construction of @xmath35 matrices @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 with the following properties .    1 .",
    "the distance of @xmath31 to the spectrum can be bounded from above in terms of the first singular value @xmath39 of @xmath36 and its singular vector ( theorem [ mainm01 ] ) .",
    "2 .   the smallest relative singular value @xmath40 is bounded from above by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are explicitly computable constants and @xmath44 is exponentially decaying in @xmath45 ( theorem [ maindist ] ) .    whereas the first property allows to prove that an eigenvalue is in a certain interval , the second property allows to determine intervals in which there are no eigenvalues .",
    "both estimates together can be used to find all eigenvalues in a specified interval .",
    "we demonstrate that these matrices can be computed within a given precision and show that the singular values can be bounded from above and below using interval arithmetics . as a proof of concept we implemented our method in fortran and in mathematica .",
    "this resulted in programs that allow to compute eigenvalues rather accurately for a surface of genus @xmath16 with given fenchel - nielsen coordinates .",
    "a mathematica program was used to compute the first eigenvalues of the bolza surface with extremely high accuracy .    the spectral zeta function @xmath46 is defined as the meromorphic continuation of the function @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the non - zero eigenvalues of the laplace operator repeated according to their multiplicities .",
    "the ( zeta - regularized ) spectral determinant @xmath49 is defined by @xmath50 ( zero is not a pole of the meromorphic continuation ) .",
    "since the meromorphic continuation is contructed from the full spectrum it is a priori not enough to know a finite part of the spectrum to compute the spectral determinant up to a certain accuracy .",
    "however , we show in section [ zeta ] that the selberg trace formula may be used in conjunction with the list of eigenvalues up to a certain threshold to calculate values of the spectral zeta function , in particular the casimir energy and the spectral determinant , up to a certain precision depending on that threshold .",
    "the spectral determinant for the laplace operator on hyperbolic surfaces is of particular importance . in the seminal paper",
    "@xcite osgood , phillips and sarnak showed that the spectral determinant is maximized at the hyperbolic metric in each conformal class of a given volume .",
    "thus , understanding the extremal properties of the determinant as a function on the space of metrics of fixed volume in dimension two is equivalent to the understanding of the spectral determinant as a function on the teichmller space of hyperbolic metrics .",
    "of course values of the determinant for non - hyperbolic surfaces can be computed from the value for the corresponding uniformized hyperbolic surface using the polyakov formula .",
    "finally , section [ zetaexa ] contains of collection of examples of interesting surfaces of genus two and three for which we computed the spectral determinant and the value of the spectral zeta function at the point @xmath51 .",
    "the set of examples contains the isolated surfaces of genus two with large symmetry group which are well known to be critical points for any value of the spectral zeta function or the spectral determinant ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we conjecture that the value of the spectral determinant is maximized at the bolza surface and we compute the value of the spectral determinant rather accurately .",
    "such a conjecture would imply that the global maximum of the spectral determinant as a function on the space of all metrics of fixed volume is attained at this point .",
    "the appendix contains explicit estimate for various resolvents as well as explicit estimates of the @xmath52 norm of eigenfunctions and derivatives of eigenfunctions .",
    "these estimates are needed to make the constants in our estimates explicit but they may also be interesting in their own right .",
    "eigenvalues of hyperbolic surfaces of genus two have been calculated in the physics literature by aurich and steiner in @xcite using the finite element method , and in @xcite using the boundary element method . in both cases the authors relied on the realization of the surface by geodesic octagons .",
    "it is quite interesting that the hadamard - gutzwiller model discussed in @xcite is actually the same as the bolza surface . using the group action and the decomposition into geodesics triangles",
    "ninnemann @xcite computed the eigenvalues of the regular geodesic octagon with every second side identified .",
    "the resulting surface , which he also refers to as the gutzwiller octagon , does however not coincide with the bolza surface .",
    "its fenchel nielsen coordinates are given in section [ regoct ] . there as well as in other parts of the physics literature the bolza surface is referred to as the regular octagon .",
    "the method of particular solutions is based on an article by fox , henrici and moler @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently further developed and revived by betcke and trefethen @xcite to achieve high accuracy in eigenvalue computations on domains with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "further versions , including domain decompositions and matching of boundary data including the normal derivative were described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "explicit error bounds for the eigenvalues in the method of particular solutions for domains in @xmath53 were given in @xcite and further improved in by alex barnett @xcite .",
    "we would also like to refer to the latter article for further background and literature on the method of particular solutions .",
    "our estimate for the error bound does not use @xcite but is instead based on the more refined information contained in the resolvent of the laplace operator on the manifold .",
    "thus , for generic eigenfunctions it is expected to give an improvement of the order of the square root of the eigenvalues .",
    "estimates that provide such an improvement without this genericity assumption have recently been obtained for domains in @xmath54 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , for hyperbolic surfaces with cusps hejhal ( @xcite and @xcite ) introduced a method to compute maass cusp forms which is based on the group action and the expansion of the embedded eigenvalues on the cusp .",
    "after most of the work in this paper was completed we learned that booker , strmbergsson and venkatesh @xcite have recently used the pre - trace formula together with the taylor expansion of boundary data of quasi - modes to rigorously verify embedded eigenvalues for the modular surface @xmath55 .",
    "their way of certifying eigenvalues is in spirit similar to the method we use to prove that our computed eigenvalues are accurate within the error bounds .",
    "apart from the fact that their method applies to a different geometric situation ( surfaces with at least one cusp ) the method of bounding the error is different when it comes to technical detail : for example in @xcite it is estimated in terms of the @xmath52-norm of the boundary data instead of the @xmath56-norm .",
    "it would be very interesting in the future to combine these ideas .",
    "in particular a modification of our estimates applies to hyperbolic surfaces with cusps .",
    "the problem of adjusting the step size in the search for maass cusp forms on @xmath57 in such a way that no eigenvalues are missed could be tackled in this way .",
    "formulae for the spectral determinant based on the length spectrum were given in the mathematics literature by fried @xcite and by pollicott and rocha @xcite , and in the physics literature by aurich and steiner @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , exponential convergence was proved and a numerical algorithm was established for the case of surfaces of genus @xmath58 in @xmath59-fenchel nielsen coordinates without twisting .",
    "we are not able to confirm the numerical values obtained in @xcite in the three examples there but obtain quite different values .",
    "we believe that the part of the length spectrum computed in @xcite was not sufficient to obtain the correct values .",
    "in contrast to the other methods employed our approach to compute the spectral determinant and the values for the zeta function allows for explicit error estimates even if the length spectrum is unknown .",
    "the method of particular solutions is a method to approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a differential operator .",
    "we will consider here the case of the laplace operator @xmath60 acting on functions on a compact oriented riemannian manifold @xmath61 . to fix notations",
    "suppose that @xmath62 is a closed subset which is the finite union of oriented compact codimension one submanifolds @xmath63 , possibly with boundary .",
    "we will assume here for simplicity that the @xmath63 intersect at most at boundary points , i.e. @xmath64 . removing @xmath65 from @xmath61 results in an open manifold @xmath66 that is the interior of a manifold with piecewise smooth boundary .",
    "this manifold might however have corners or other singularities .",
    "we would like to define the class of functions that are `` smooth up to the boundary '' on @xmath66 . in order to do this",
    "let us be more precise about how the manifold with piecewise smooth boundary is constructed from @xmath61 and @xmath65 .",
    "the space @xmath66 equipped with the geodesic distance is not complete and we denote by @xmath67 its abstract metric completion . since @xmath61 is complete there is a natural continuous surjection @xmath68 .",
    "we define a function @xmath69 to be smooth if and only if for every point @xmath70 there exists an open neighborhood @xmath71 such that there exists a smooth function @xmath72 on @xmath61 with @xmath73 .",
    "the corresponding sheaf of smooth functions endows @xmath67 with the structure of a smooth manifold with piecewise smooth boundary .",
    "we write @xmath74 for the space of smooth functions on @xmath67 .    of course",
    "an element @xmath75 can be understood as a function in @xmath76 as the boundary of @xmath67 has zero measure and the interior of @xmath67 can be identified with @xmath66 .",
    "we will now make this identification without further mention . since each @xmath63",
    "is oriented there is a natural unit normal vector field @xmath77 to @xmath63 and a closed tubular neighborhood of @xmath63 diffeomorphic to @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "a function @xmath75 therefore has two boundary values on @xmath63 , a right boundary value @xmath79 and a left boundary value @xmath80 .",
    "both are smooth functions on @xmath63 .",
    "of course the function @xmath81 is continuous on @xmath61 if and only if for all indices @xmath82 @xmath83 similarly , @xmath84 if and only if for all @xmath82 @xmath85 here , @xmath86 denotes the right and left limits of the normal derivative of @xmath32 .    let us define @xmath87 to be the function on each manifold @xmath63 given by @xmath88 and let @xmath89 be the function given by @xmath90 . let @xmath91 and @xmath92 be the corresponding functions in @xmath93 . as the boundary of @xmath65 has zero measure in @xmath65 these functions are well defined and they are smooth on each @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath94 .",
    "the functional @xmath95 defined by @xmath96 measures the continuity of the function and its normal derivatives in different sobolev norms . here",
    "the @xmath97 norm on @xmath65 is defined as @xmath98    let now as above @xmath75 and let @xmath99 be defined by @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "suppose that @xmath102 is any test function .",
    "then , by green s formula ( see e.g. prop . 4.1 in @xcite ) , @xmath103 where @xmath104 denotes the unit normal vector field along @xmath65 , @xmath105 is the measure induced by the riemannian metric on @xmath61 , and @xmath106 are the measures on @xmath107 and @xmath65 induced by the riemannian metrics there .",
    "if we think of @xmath32 as a distribution on @xmath61 , then the above simply means that we have in the distributional sense @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the dirac delta distribution on @xmath65 and @xmath110 is its normal derivative so that for a test function @xmath102 the above distributions are given by @xmath111 and @xmath112 note that the distribution @xmath113 is in @xmath114 .",
    "denote by @xmath115 its @xmath116-norm , where the @xmath97-norm is defined by @xmath117 .    by the trace theorem for sobolev spaces ( see e.g. prop .",
    "4.5 in @xcite ) the maps @xmath118 and @xmath119 extend to bounded maps from @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively .",
    "hence , by duality , @xmath122 and @xmath123 for some constants @xmath124 . thus , there exists a constant @xmath125 depending only on the geometry of @xmath61 and @xmath65 such that @xmath126 a constant @xmath127 in this estimate can be explicitly found for a given manifold , for example by using gluing functions and the fourier transform .",
    "we will illustrate in section [ sec : mps_on_surface ] how to get a bound on @xmath127 for a given hyperbolic surface when @xmath65 consists of geodesic segments ( cf .",
    "( [ sbound1 ] ) and ( [ sbound2 ] ) ) .",
    "the method of particular solutions relies on the following simple observation .",

    "it immediately follows that in case @xmath140 exists its operator norm is bounded from below by @xmath141 this implies the theorem since the operator norm of the resolvent at the point @xmath31 is bounded from above by the inverse of the distance of @xmath31 to the spectrum .",
    "[ remrem ] the statement of the previous theorem also applies to situations where eigenvalues might be close to each other or have high multiplicities . not to overload notation we state this here only as a remark .",
    "if there is an orthonormal set @xmath142 in @xmath12 such that for each of the @xmath32 the conditions of theorem [ main01 ] hold , then the same proof shows that there are at least @xmath45 eigenvalues ( counting multiplicities ) in a small interval around @xmath31 .    to apply the method of particular solutions one constructs normalized functions @xmath32 which are eigenfunctions of the laplace operator on each of the @xmath143 with eigenvalue @xmath31 and for which @xmath144 is small .",
    "the above theorems then show that @xmath31 must be close to an eigenvalue and @xmath32 is close to an eigenfunction .",
    "we will show in the following how this can be done for oriented hyperbolic surfaces of genus @xmath16 .",
    "a hyperbolic surface is a @xmath58-dimensional orientable riemannian manifold endowed with a metric of constant negative curvature equal to @xmath145 .",
    "such surfaces can be obtained by factorizing the hyperbolic plane @xmath146 with metric @xmath147 by a discrete co - compact hyperbolic subgroup @xmath65 of @xmath148 .",
    "the isometric action of @xmath148 is given by fractional linear transformations @xmath149 another way to obtain a surface of genus @xmath16 with hyperbolic metric is to glue @xmath150 hyperbolic pair of pants .",
    "a hyperbolic pair of pants is a genus @xmath151 surface with boundary @xmath152 equipped with a metric of constant negative curvature @xmath145 such that the boundary curves are geodesics ( see figure [ pants ] ) .",
    "we will also refer to such a surface as a @xmath153-piece .",
    "-piece with boundary geodesics , width=113 ]    such hyperbolic pairs of pants are , up to isometry , uniquely determined by the length of their boundary geodesics @xmath154 .",
    "any hyperbolic surface can be decomposed into pairs of pants by cutting along @xmath155 non - intersecting simple geodesics on the surface ( see figure [ genus3figure ] ) .",
    "this results in @xmath150 pairs of pants .",
    "-pieces , width=377 ]    a pair of pants can be glued from a right angled geodesic octagon in the upper half space ( see figure [ octi ] ) by identifying the sides @xmath156 and @xmath157 , as well as @xmath158 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "as indicated in the figure the geodesic octagon is constructed from two right angled geodesic hexagons .",
    "-piece glued from a right angled geodesic octagon , width=188 ]    note that identification of the sides @xmath156 and @xmath157 only yields a subset of a hyperbolic cylinder so that every pair of pants can be constructed from a hyperbolic cylinder by cutting and gluing .",
    "the first ingredient in our algorithm is an estimate on the constant in the estimate ( [ const ] ) for @xmath159 in the particular case when @xmath61 is a hyperbolic surface and @xmath65 is a finite union of geodesic segments .",
    "to start let us assume that @xmath65 consists of exactly one geodesic segment .",
    "the general case of a finite union of geodesic segments will later be reduced to this case .",
    "we can assume that @xmath61 is realized as a quotient of the upper half plane @xmath160 by some co - compact hyperbolic subgroup in @xmath161 and that @xmath162 is an ( open ) fundamental domain whose boundary is a geodesic polygon .",
    "this means we can identify functions on @xmath61 with functions on @xmath160 that are invariant under the action of the group .",
    "we can also assume that the geodesic segment @xmath65 is a segment on the imaginary axis .",
    "then there is a tesselation of @xmath160 by translates @xmath163 of @xmath164 .",
    "let @xmath165 and suppose that @xmath166 is a finite number of translates of @xmath164 such that @xmath167 implies that @xmath168 is contained in the closure of @xmath169 . if @xmath170 is chosen as the smallest distance between non - adjacent sides of @xmath164 then @xmath171 would be the minimal number of fundamental domains of @xmath164 needed to cover an open neighborhood of @xmath172 ( and thus the number of neighboring fundamental domains sharing either an edge or a corner with @xmath164 ) .",
    "let @xmath173 $ ] be smooth compactly supported function which is equal to one in an open neighborhood @xmath174 of @xmath164 with support contained in @xmath175 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath157 is a distribution on @xmath61 .",
    "then , @xmath176 using @xmath177 where the inner product is with respect to the metric , we get @xmath178 of course @xmath179 since @xmath180 is invariant under the group action @xmath181 and therefore we obtain @xmath182 with @xmath183 consequently , @xmath184 to continue we use a particular coordinate system on the upper half space .",
    "namely , we identify the upper half space with @xmath185 using coordinates @xmath186 and the metric @xmath187 such that @xmath188 coincides with the imaginary axis and the coordinate system is centered at the point @xmath189 .",
    "note that @xmath186 is related to fermi coordinates @xmath190 by @xmath191 .",
    "we assume that in these coordinates @xmath65 is identified with the segment @xmath192 $ ] so that @xmath157 has the form @xmath193 moreover in these coordinates @xmath4 has the form @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the euclidean laplace operator in coordinates @xmath186",

    "collecting all terms we obtain @xmath198 however , @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 are understood as functions on @xmath202 extended by zero from @xmath203 $ ] .",
    "therefore , we finally obtain @xmath204 where the constant @xmath127 is given by @xmath205 if @xmath65 consists of several geodesic segments then of course the same inequality holds with the constant being the maximum of the constants for the individual segments .    for low lying eigenvalues",
    "it is in practice easier to compute the @xmath56-norms of @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "of course since the negative sobolev norms are dominated by the @xmath56-norms the above gives estimates of @xmath206 in terms of the @xmath56-norms of @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "however , in this case a slightly better constant can be obtained using theorems [ app1 ] and [ app2 ] . indeed ,",
    "equation [ sob ] means by duality that @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the laplace operator on the hyperbolic plane . by theorem",
    "[ app1 ] and [ app2 ] we have @xmath209 where @xmath210 and @xmath211 are the constants in these theorems .    for a surface of genus",

    "we then get @xmath222 where we used the well known formula @xmath223 and the fact that near a fixed point all but at most two of the functions @xmath224 are constant .",
    "since @xmath225 is not smooth we can not directly use it in our estimate .",
