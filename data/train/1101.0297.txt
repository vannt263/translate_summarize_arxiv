    "tropicalization is a procedure that takes an algebraic variety @xmath2 to a polyhedral complex @xmath3 .",
    "many algebraic properties of @xmath2 are reflected in the combinatorics of @xmath3 . in a certain sense",
    ", @xmath3 is special among polyhedral complexes in that it arose from an algebraic variety .",
    "a natural question is _ how special must a tropicalization be ? _ in other words , _ which polyhedral complexes arise from algebraic varieties ? _    tropical geometry studies varieties over a field @xmath4 with a non - trivial discrete valuation @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath2 is a @xmath6-dimensional subvariety of the algebraic torus @xmath7 , then the tropicalization , @xmath8 is a balanced weighted rational polyhedral complex of pure dimension @xmath6 .",
    "given such a complex @xmath9 , one may ask if there is an algebraic variety @xmath2 with @xmath10 .",
    "if so , we say @xmath9 _",
    "lifts_. this question is called the _ lifting problem _ in tropical geometry .",
    "the lifting problem is surprisingly subtle even for one - dimensional varieties .",
    "a one - dimensional balanced weighted rational polyhedral complex or _ tropical curve _ is an edge - weighted graph in @xmath11 with rational edge directions that satisfies a balancing condition at each vertex .",
    "mikhalkin showed that balanced trees and more generally regular tropical curves always lift @xcite .",
    "speyer gave a sufficient condition for a balanced graph with one cycle to lift to an algebraic curve of genus one @xcite .",
    "his condition is also necessary when the graph is trivalent and the residue field of @xmath4 is of characteristic zero .",
    "the condition was extended to certain higher - genus graphs by nishinou @xcite and in forthcoming work of brugall - mikhalkin and tyomkin .",
    "the second - named author has also found new obstructions for lifting tropical curves in space @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the following two variants of the lifting problem :    the _ relative lifting problem _ is the following : let @xmath2 be a variety in @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a balanced weighted rational polyhedral complex contained in @xmath3 .",
    "does there exist a subvariety @xmath12 with @xmath13 ?    the _ lifting problem for pairs _ is the following : let @xmath9 and @xmath14 be balanced weighted rational polyhedral complexes with @xmath15 .",
    "do there exist varieties @xmath16 with @xmath13 and @xmath17 ?    specifically , we consider the case where @xmath9 is a tropical curve and @xmath2 is a surface in @xmath18 or @xmath14 is a tropical surface in @xmath19 .",
    "answering lifting questions in this case is a prerequisite to using tropical curves to count classical curves in surfaces in a way analogous to mikhalkin s work on curves in toric surfaces @xcite .",
    "we produce necessary conditions for a pair consisting of a tropical curve @xmath9 in a unimodular tropical surface to lift .",
    "in contrast to the previously mentioned results which gives constraints on the structure of cycles in @xmath9 , our conditions are local : they depend only on the stars of the polyhedral complexes @xmath9 and @xmath14 at particular points .",
    "we use our conditions to show that some very unusual tropical curves on tropical surfaces exhibited by vigeland @xcite do not lift .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ maintheorem ] let @xmath20 be a tropical curve in a unimodular tropical surface in @xmath19 .",
    "suppose that @xmath21 is a vertex or an interior point of an edge of @xmath22 and that @xmath23 spans a rational plane @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath9 lifts in @xmath25 then one of the following must hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath9 is locally equivalent to an integral multiple of the stable intersection @xmath26 , or 2 .   the stable intersection @xmath26 contains a classical segment of weight @xmath27 with @xmath21 in its interior as a local tropical cycle summand at @xmath21 .",
    "the proof proceeds by a series of reduction steps . by replacing a variety @xmath2 by its initial degeneration @xmath28 ,",
    "we reduce to the constant - coefficient case where varieties are defined over a field @xmath29 with trivial valuation . in this case",
    ", a unimodular surface become a plane . by intersecting @xmath28 with an appropriately chosen toric surface",
    ", we reduce the situation to a problem in one dimension smaller .",
    "specifically , our surface in space is replaced by a curve in a toric surface .",
    "this curve is fewnomial : the laurent polynomial defining it has very few terms .",
    "this is very close in sprit to the work of khovanski@xcite on relating the geometry of hypersurfaces to their support .",
    "the tropical graph that we want to lift will be contained in the tropicalization of that curve .",
    "any lift must be a component of that curve .",
    "we then apply combinatorial obstructions to this happening .",
    "there is an obvious combinatorial obstruction for one curve in a @xmath30-dimensional algebraic torus to be a component of another . if @xmath31 $ ] , then knowing the tropicalizations of @xmath25 and @xmath32 is equivalent to knowing the newton polygons @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath35 is a factor of @xmath36 , then @xmath34 must be a minkowski summand of @xmath33 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to @xmath37 being a tropical cycle summand of @xmath22 .",
    "however , there are deeper obstructions that come from looking at the support of @xmath36 and @xmath35 , that is , the set of monomials in their expressions . knowing this support , we are able to say , in certain cases , that @xmath35 can not possibly divide @xmath36 even though @xmath34 is a minkowski summand of @xmath33 .",
    "we were inspired by the approach to the absolute lifting problem for curves presented in the work of nishinou - siebert @xcite which itself is a log geometry analogue of the patchworking approach of mikhalkin @xcite following viro @xcite .",
    "the heuristic for studying lifting problems is as follows .",
    "first , one uses the tropicalization of a curve as a blueprint to construct a degeneration of the ambient algebraic toric variety to a broken toric variety . in each component of the broken toric variety ,",
    "one construct components of a broken curve .",
    "then one matchs the components together to create a global broken object .",
    "finally , one uses deformation theory to extend the broken object to a smooth object in the algebraic torus .",
    "the obstruction we study is a failure to construct the components of the broken curve .",
    "there are likely to be further obstructions in the other steps .",
    "in fact , all lifting obstructions for curves in space previously known to us occur in the deformation theory step .",
    "since the preprint of this paper first appeared , brugall and shaw released a preprint offering a different approach to lifting obstructions for tropical curves in smooth tropical surfaces @xcite .",
    "their approach is based on intersecting a tropical curve with a canonical divisor and with a hessian divisor . among other things , they are able to use their results to give a classification of liftable balanced weighted fans in tropical planes in @xmath19 .",
    "we now outline the remainder of the paper .",
    "section 2 reviews tropical background .",
    "section 3 studies the intersection and containment of tropical varieties and rational subspsaces .",
    "section 4 addresses combinatorial obstructions to a hypersurface being contained in another .",
    "section 5 uses these obstructions to study the lifting problems of curves in planes in the constant coefficient case .",
    "section 6 reduces the case of tropical curves in unimodular surfaces to the case considered in section 5 .",
    "section 7 applies the lifting criteria to vigeland s curves .",
    "section 8 provides combinatorial results about bivariate polynomials that are needed in section 4 .",
    "section 9 which is logically independent from the rest of the paper gives an example of a tropical curve that fails to lift in one surface yet lifts in another surface with the same tropicalization .",
    "this shows that the relative lifting problem does not have a purely combinatorial resolution and is not equivalent to the lifting problem for pairs .",

    "we would like to thank erwan brugall , ethan cotterill , mark gross , diane maclagan , gregg musiker , sam payne , johannes rau , kristin shaw , bernd siebert , and bernd sturmfels for valuable conversations .",

    "the case that @xmath34 contains @xmath378 is identical .",
    "finally , suppose @xmath34 and @xmath245 are both triangles .",
