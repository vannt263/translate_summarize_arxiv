    "it is well - known that when @xmath1 is compact the global lefschetz number of @xmath4 @xmath5 is expressed as the integral of a local cohomology class @xmath6 supported by @xmath3 , where we set @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the orientation sheaf of @xmath1 ( see dold @xcite , @xcite etc . ) .",
    "let @xmath9 be the decomposition of @xmath3 into connected components and @xmath10 the associated direct sum decompositions .",
    "we call the integral @xmath11 of the local cohomology class @xmath12 for a fixed point component @xmath13 the local contribution from @xmath13",
    ". then the global lefschetz number of @xmath4 is equal to the sum of the local contributions from @xmath13 s : @xmath14 but if the fixed point component @xmath13 is higher - dimensional , it is in general very difficult to compute the local contribution by the following dimensional reason .",
    "let @xmath13 be a fixed point component of @xmath4 whose codimension @xmath15 in @xmath1 satisfies the condition @xmath16 .",
    "then the local cohomology group @xmath17 is isomorphic to the @xmath18-dimensional borel - moore homology group @xmath19 of @xmath13 by the alexander duality , and the class @xmath20 in it can not be calculated locally at each point of @xmath13 . on the other hand , top - dimensional borel - moore homology cycles in @xmath13 , i.e. elements in @xmath21 can be much more easily handled since they are realized as sections of a relative orientation sheaf on @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    ", we overcome this difficulty partially by using our new lagrangian cycles introduced in @xcite . since we also want to study lefschetz fixed point formulas over singular varieties ( and those for intersection cohomology groups ) , from now we consider the following very general setting .",

    "* theorem 3.9.2 ) , lee @xcite and toledo - tong @xcite . under the condition , in @xcite we constructed a new lagrangian cycle @xmath51 in the cotangent bundle @xmath52 .",
    "we call it the lefschetz cycle associated with the pair @xmath30 and the fixed point component @xmath3 .",
    "note that in the more general setting of elliptic pairs a similar construction of microlocal lefschetz classes was previously given in guillermou @xcite .",
    "the difference from his is that we explicitly realized them as lagrangian cycles in @xmath52 . for recent results on this subject ,",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite etc . note",
    "also that if @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , our lefschetz cycle @xmath51 coincides with the characteristic cycle @xmath56 of @xmath23 introduced by kashiwara @xcite .",
    "by lefschetz cycles , in @xcite we could generalize almost all nice properties of characteristic cycles .",
    "in particular , we have the following microlocal index theorem for the local contribution @xmath57 from @xmath3 .    * ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "our answer to this problem is as follows .",
    "let @xmath63 be the isomorphism between the @xmath44-vector space consisting of the @xmath44-valued ( subanalytically ) constructible functions on @xmath3 and that of closed conic subanalytic lagrangian cycles on @xmath52 with coefficients in @xmath44 ( see proposition [ prp:2 - 10 ] ) .",
    "then in section [ sec:6 ] we define a @xmath44-valued constructible function @xmath64 on @xmath3 associated to the hyperbolic localization of the specialization @xmath65 of @xmath23 in the sense of braden @xcite , braden - proudfoot @xcite and goresky - macpherson @xcite .",
    "more precisely , for each point @xmath66 by taking an expanding subbundle ( see definition [ dfn:6 - 2 ] ) @xmath67 of @xmath68 on its neighborhood @xmath69 we set @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the hyperbolic localization of @xmath65 with respect to @xmath72 and @xmath73 is its endomorphism induced by @xmath74",
    ". then we have the following result .",
    "[ m - thm ] we have the equality @xmath75 as lagrangian cycles in @xmath52 .",

    "note that when @xmath78 this theorem coincides with kashiwara s one in ( * ? ? ?",

    "it gives also an affirmative answer to a conjecture of goresky - macpherson @xcite in particular for smooth fixed point components ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , ( 1.12 ) open problems ) ) . in the previous results in @xcite , the authors assumed a technical condition that there exists a special indicator map @xmath79 on a neighborhood @xmath80 of @xmath3 in @xmath1 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition ( 3.1 ) ) ) .",
    "they call such an endomorphism @xmath4 a weakly hyperbolic map .",
    "moreover by taking @xmath72 to be the minimal expanding subbundle ( see definition [ dfn:6 - 1 ] ) @xmath81 of @xmath68 on @xmath69 we can reduce the calculation of the local contribution @xmath82 to that on a subset @xmath81 much smaller than the one in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to loc .",
    ", at each point of @xmath3 we can take the smallest possible @xmath72 containing only the generalized eigenspaces for the eigenvalues of @xmath83 in @xmath84 .",
    "compare our stalk formula of @xmath85 in proposition [ prp:6 - 7 ] with the theorem in @xcite .",
    "thus theorem [ m - thm ] improves the results in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite etc . in order to prove it even in the difficult case where the set @xmath43 varies depending on @xmath86 , we require some precise arguments on our lefschetz cycles ( see remark [ rem:3 - 6 ] ) . more precisely , we encode kashiwara s characteristic class @xmath87 satisfying @xmath88 to the geometric cycle @xmath62 in @xmath52 and calculate the latter locally by applying our microlocal index theorem to hyperbolic localizations .",
    "namely @xmath62 enables us to patch local calculations to a global one .",
    "see section [ sec:6 ] for the details .",
    "finally in section [ sec:7 ] we will show various examples for which the function @xmath89 and the local contribution @xmath90 can be explicitly calculated .",
    "in particular , we will give a very short proof to the following result proved first in @xcite by using some deep results on the functorial properties of lefschetz cycles ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 5 and 6 ) ) .",

    "then we have @xmath96 where the @xmath44-valued constructible function @xmath97 on @xmath98 is defined by @xmath99 for @xmath100 .    thus theorems [ m - thm ] and [ thm - nc ]",
    "show that we can calculate the global trace of @xmath30 locally at each point of @xmath3 without assuming any further technical condition such as @xmath101 on the map @xmath4 .",
    "note that if there exists a point @xmath42 such that @xmath102 the classical methods ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 9.6 ) ) for localizations do not work .",
    "our main result in this paper , that is theorem [ m - thm ] is much more general than theorem [ thm - nc ] since in the former we do not assume that @xmath95 is non - characteristic for @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , it immediately implies general lefschetz fixed point formulas for singular subvarieties @xmath103 of @xmath1 such that @xmath104 by applying it to the special case where @xmath105 and @xmath74 is the natural morphism @xmath106 .",
    "note that a complete answer to this problem is known only for some special cases ( for the case of normal complex algebraic surfaces , see saito @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper , we essentially follow the terminology in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for example , for a topological space @xmath1 , we denote by @xmath107 the derived category of bounded complexes of sheaves of @xmath24-modules on @xmath1 . from now on , we shall review basic notions and known results concerning lefschetz fixed point formulas .",
    "since we focus our attention on lefschetz fixed point formulas for constructible sheaves in this paper , we treat here only real analytic manifolds and morphisms .",
