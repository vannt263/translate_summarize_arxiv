    "one of the remote probing techniques for the ionosphere is the method of radio waves incoherent scatter .",
    "the method is based on the scattering of radio waves from ionospheric plasma dielectric permittivity irregularities [ _ evans _ , 1969 ] .",
    "furthermore , two different experimental configurations are involved : monostatic ( where the receive and transmit antennas are combined ) and bistatic ( where these antennas are spaced ) . in actual practice , it is customary to use the monostatic configuration . ionospheric plasma parameters ( ion composition , drift velocity , electron and ion temperatures , and electron density ) in this case are determined from the scattered signal received after completion of the radiated pulse .",
    "the spectral power of the received signal , averaged over sounding runs ( realizations ) , is related ( assuming that such an averaging is equivalent to statistical averaging ) to the mean spectral density of dielectric permittivity irregularities by the radar equation [ _ tatarsky _ , 1969 ] .",
    "the connection of the dielectric permittivity irregularities spectral density with mean statistical parameters of the medium is usually determined in terms of kinetic theory [ _ clemow and dougherty_,1969 ; _ sheffield _ , 1975 ; _",
    "kofman_,1997 ] .",
    "the location and size of the ionospheric region that makes a contribution to the scattered signal ( sounding volume ) is determined by the antenna beam shape , the sounding radio pulse , and by the time window of spectral processing [ _ suni et al .",
    "_ , 1989 ] .",
    "the shape of the sounding volume determines also the method s spectral resolution , the accuracy to which the mean spectral density of dielectric permittivity is determined ( which , in turn , affects the determination accuracy of macroscopic ionospheric parameters : electron and ion temperatures , the drift velocity , and electron density ) .",
    "the number of realizations , over which the received signal spectral power is averaged , determines the method s time resolution , i.e. its ability to keep track ( based on measurements ) of fast changes of macroscopic parameters of ionospheric plasma .",
    "currently most incoherent scatter radars have accumulated extensive sets of the scattered signal individual realizations ( private communications of p.erickson ( millstone hill ) , v.lysenko ( kharkov is radar ) , and g.wannberg ( eiscat ) ) .",
    "therefore , attempts are made to analyze the realizations from different methods which differ from a standard averaging by their sounding runs .",
    "basically , these methods imply looking for small scatterers making the main contribution to the scattered signal .",
    "this method is good for analyzing signals scattered from meteors and their traces [ _ pellinen - wannberg _ , 1998 ] ; however , it is insufficiently substantiated for describing the scattering in the ionosphere .    in the work",
    "there were used the experimental data obtained with irkutsk incoherent scatter radar .",
    "the radar is located at @xmath0 , it has sounding frequency 152 - 160 mhz and peak power 3mw .",
    "high signal - to - noice ratio during the experiments under investigation ( s / n > 10 ) allows us to neglect the noice effects when analyzing the signal received .",
    "the technique of the incoherent scatter signal processing in irkutsk is radar is the following .",
    "for each single realization of received signal we calculate spectrum in time window with width equal to the sounding signal duration and with delay corresponding to the radar range to the sounding volume investigated .",
    "the sounding signal we use in this experiment is a radiopulse with duration 800 mks .",
    "the repeating frequency approximately 25 hz .",
    "averaging over the 1000 realizations corresponds to @xmath1 dispersium of the overaged spectrum relative to its mathematical expectation .",
    "the reason of using such a simple pulse is to investigate the fine structure of the single ( unaveraged ) spectrums in this simpliest case .",
    "figure  [ figone ] exemplifies the mean spectral power of the scattered signal and its separate realizations , based on the data from the irkutsk incoherent scatter radar .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the spectral power of the scattered signal in an individual realization ( figure  [ figone](b - d ) ) differs drastically from that averaged over realizations ( figure  [ figone](a ) ) ; therefore , existing model of the incoherently scattered signal , based on averaging over sounding runs , are inapplicable for its interpretation .",
    "for that reason , development of new models of the scattered signal for analyzing its separate realizations without averaging them is important from the theoretical and practical standpoint .",
    "sometimes it is useful to suppose that incoherent scattering signal is a random gaussian one [ for example , _ farley _",
    ", 1969 ; _ zhou _ , 1999 ] .",
    "but , it is well known that the signal received is a detirministic function of ionospheric dielectric permittivity @xmath2 and is fully determined in first approximation by the born s formula ( in one or another its form [ _ ishimaru _ , 1978 ; _ berngardt and potekhin _ , 2000 ] ) , this relation could be called as a radar equation for signals [ _ berngardt and potekhin _ , 2000 ] .",
    "the dielectric permittivity irregularities also could be supposed as a random functions , but they are deterministic functional of some other functions ( in case of uncollisional unmagnetized palsma with one ions type those functions are phase density of the ions and electrons as functions of velocity , location and time , ion composition and temperatures of the ions and electrons , this functional dependence is determined by the landau s solution [ _ landau _ , 1946 ] ) .    if one could determine all these unknown functions , the received signal shape in single realization will be fully determined , and could be analyzed without using any statistical methods .",
    "such an approach , for example , is used in radioacoustical technique of the athmosphere sounding when the delectric permittivity irregularities ( by which the radisignal is scattered ) are generated by the acoustical wave [ _ kalistratova and kon _ , 1985 ] .",
    "the statistical proporties of the single realizations are showed at figure  [ figstat ] . from this figure",
    "it becomes clear that the unaveraged spectrum has the fine structure - it consists from a number of peaks with approximately 1.5khz width ( and this width very slightly depends on frequency ) , which could be characterized by the peak amplitude(amplitude at the maximum of the peak ) and peak appearence ( number of realizations in which there is a peak maximum at given frequency ) at the given frequency , and those properties distributions are not gaussian ones but have double peaked structure and located in the same band with incoherent scattering average spectral power .",
    "this fact allows as to suppose that not only average spectral power of the received signal depends on ionosperical parameters , but the fine structure of non - averaged spectra too .    at first , it is neccessary to understand quilitatively , what information one could obtain from one realization of the is signal .",
    "it is well known , that after any statistical processing of a function a part of the information is loosed irreversibly ( for example .",
    "when one calucaltes the first n statistical moments , all the rest moments , starting with n+1 are still unknown ) .",
    "that is why , if the statistical characteristics of the realizations ( mean spectral power or correlation function ) are depend on the ion and electron temperatures and the ion composition then single realization must depend on all those parameters and on some new additional parameters .",
    "it is clear that to determine temperatures and ion composition from averaged signal parameters is much easier than from single realization ( because the second one includes additional parameters ) , and we can use the ones obtained from mean spectral power , with necessary spatial and spectral resolution , using different techniques , for example alternating codes [ _ lehtinen _ , 1986 ] .",
    "but the new additional parameters can be determined from single realizations only .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find out the functional dependence of single realization spectrum on all the parameters , including well known ( temperatures and ion composition ) and new ones , which could describe the single realizations spectrum properties . for this propose",
    "we will use for analysis only signals with high signal to noise ratio ( more than 10 ) , because in this case the noice effects could be neglected and the received signal could be supposed as only is signal without presence any noice .",
    "to analyze the individual realizations of the scattered signal , it is necessary to have a convenient expression relating the spectrum of the scattered signal to the space - time spectrum of dielectric permittivity irregularities without averaging over realizations .",
    "such an expression for a monostatic experimental configuration was obtained and analyzed in [ _ berngardt and potekhin _ , 2000 ] .",
    "it holds true in the far zone of the receive - transmit antenna and , within constant factors ( unimportant for a subsequent discussion ) , is    @xmath3    here @xmath4 - is the space - time spectrum of dielectric permittivity irregularities ; @xmath5 - is the narrow - band weight function ; @xmath6 - are , respectively , the sounder signal envelope and the time window of spectral processing ; @xmath7 - is the antenna factor which is the product of the antenna patterns by reception and transmission ; @xmath8 - is a unit vector in a given direction ; @xmath9 - the wave number of the sounding wave ; @xmath10 -is the velocity of light .",
    "suppose that sounding signal and receiving window of spectral processing are located in time near the moments @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively and theirs carriers do not intersects ( this is the one of the radar equation ( [ eq : rlu ] ) obtaining conditions [ _ berngardt and potekhin _ , 2000 ] ) . in this case",
    "the carrier of the weight function @xmath13 is located near the @xmath14 . by going in equation ( [ eq : rlu ] ) to the spectrums",
    "calcualated relative to the weight volume center ( to remove the oscillated multipliers under integral ) , we obtain ( neglecting to the unessentional multiplier ) :    @xmath15{l } \\int h_{1}(\\omega -\\nu , k-2k_{0}-\\frac{\\nu } { 2c } ) \\frac{g(-\\widehat{\\textrm{k}})}{k } \\\\",

    "then the low - frequency ( ion - acoustic ) part of the irregularities spectrum in a statistically homogeneous , unmagnetized , collisionless ionospheric plasma with one sort of ions is determined by plasma macroscopic parameters ( electron and ion temperatures , ion composition , and drift velocity ) , and by unknown conditions in the moment @xmath20 related to which this spectrum is calculated - the ions number phase density in a six - dimensional phase space of velocities and positions of particles .",
    "it is known that the dielectric permittivity irregularities spectrum at large wave numbers of the sounding wave @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is plasma frequency ) , is proportional to the electron density irregularities spectrum [ _ landau and lifshitz_,1982 , par.78 ] :    @xmath23    which is given by the expression ( for example , [ _ sheffield _ , 1975 , sect.6 ] ) :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 - is longitudinal dielectric permittivity ; wave number @xmath26 should be small enought to wave length be smaller than debye length ( solpiter approximation ) .",
    "most part of is radars have the sounding frequencies(50 - 1000 mhz ) within these limitations .",
    "@xmath27    @xmath28- are equilibrium distribution functions of the electrons and ions velocity and their densities ; @xmath29- are the mass and charges of electrons and ions , respectively ; @xmath30 - the ions number phase density in a six - dimensional phase space of velocities and positions of particles ( the ions number phase density , inpd , at @xmath31 ) , with the summation made over all ions . generally equilibrium distribution functions @xmath32 are taken to be maxwellian , with the temperatures @xmath33 and @xmath34 for electrons and ions , respectively , and in the absence of a drift they are @xmath35 where @xmath36 stands for the thermal velocities of electrons and ions , respectively .",
    "then the functions @xmath37 have the well - known analytical expression , for example [ _ sheffield_,1975 ] :    @xmath38    where@xmath39 the physical meaning of the expression ( [ eq : irregularities ] ) is as follows : the position and velocity of each ion at the moment @xmath20 are determined by the inpd @xmath40 , and the dielectric permittivity irregularities @xmath41 are determined by ion - acoustic oscillations of plasma under the action of such initial conditions .",
    "traditionally , the incoherent scattered signal is processed in the following way .",
    "a set of the scattered signal spectra ( [ eq : rlu ] ) is used to obtain its spectral power averaged over realizations . by assuming that an averaging over the realizations is equivalent to a statistical averaging , and also by assuming a maxwellian distribution of the inpd @xmath42",
    ", one can obtain the following expression for the mean spectral power of the scattered signal [ _ suni et al._,1989 ] :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the smearing function determined by the spectrum of the sounder signal and the spectral processing time window ; and @xmath45 is averaging over realizations .",
    "the frequency dependence of the scattered signal mean spectral power ( [ eq : average_rlu ] ) under usual ionospheric conditions has a typical two - hump form ( figure  [ figone](a ) ) [ _ evans_,1969 ] . from the scattered signal",
    "mean spectral power ( [ eq : average_rlu ] ) it is possible to determine the electron @xmath33 and ion @xmath34 temperatures and the drift velocity @xmath46 involved in a familiar way in the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 [ _ sheffield_,1975 ] .    in single realizations , however , the scattered signal spectral",
    "power differs essentially from the mean spectral power .",
    "figure  [ figone ] presents the scattered signalspectral power in three consecutive realizations ( figure  [ figone](a - c ) ) , the spectral power averaged over 1000 realizations ( figure  [ figone](d ) ) , and the spectral power of the sounder signal envelope ( figure  [ figone](e ) ) . from figure  [ figone ]",
    "it is evident that the non averaged spectral power of the incoherent scatter signal ( figure  [ figone](a - c ) ) has a typical peaked form , the width of peaks is larger than that of the sounder signal spectrum , and the peaks themselves are concentrated in the band of the mean signal spectral power . in the case of an averaging over realizations , such a peaked structure transforms to a typical smooth two - hump structure ( figure  [ figone](d ) ) .",
    "to obtain a model of the incoherent scatter signal we substitute the landau s expression for dielectric permittivity irregularities ( [ eq : irregularities ] ) into the expression for the scattered signal spectrum ( [ eq : rlu_mod ] ) . using in ( [ eq : irregularities ] ) the spatial spectrum @xmath49 of the ions number phase density @xmath40 , and upon interchanging the order of integration , we obtain the one - realization model for the scattered signal spectrum : @xmath50    @xmath51    here@xmath52 is unknown function we want to determine from experiment and has a form similar to the radon transform of the function @xmath53 . a kinetic function ( showed at figure  [ figtwo ] )",
    "@xmath54 is determined by macroscopic parameters of ionospheric plasma @xmath55 and @xmath56 ; these parameters can be determined , for example , from measurements of the mean spectral power of the received signal ( [ eq : average_rlu ] ) .",
    "thus the kernel @xmath57 is completely determined by the sounder signal , the receiving window , and by macroscopic characteristics of ionospheric plasma . the expression ( [ eq : signal_model ] ) clearly shows the meaning of the kernel @xmath57 : it determines the selective properties of the model , i.e. the possibilities of determining the unknown function @xmath58 from the measured @xmath59 .",
    "hence it can be termed the weight volume in the space @xmath60 , or ambiguity function .",
    "since the function @xmath61 is a narrow - band one , with its carrier concentrated near zero , the function of indefiniteness @xmath62 has also a limited carrier in @xmath26 near @xmath63 .",
    "the possibilities of determining the unknown function @xmath58 dependence on the wave vector directions @xmath64 are determined by the product of the kinetic function @xmath65 and the antenna beam @xmath66 .    according to the resulting model ( [ eq : signal_model ] ) , the form of scattered signal single spectrum is determined both by a determinate component ( the weight volume @xmath62 ) , and by a random ( i.e. dependent on time by the unknown way ) component . a random component is the function @xmath58 determined by the spartial harmonics packet of the inpd @xmath53 with wave numbers @xmath26 , concentrated near @xmath67 and calculated relative to the moment @xmath31 .",
    "the moment @xmath20 is determined by the moments of the sounding signal transmitting and spectral processing receiving window location , and corresponds to the middle moment between them @xmath68 .",
    "the weight volume @xmath62 determines the parameters of this wave packet , the region of wave vectors and velocities in @xmath58 which make the main contribution to the scattered signal at a particular frequency @xmath69 .      in this experiment the spectra sounder signal @xmath70 and the receiving window @xmath71",
    "are selected such as they are sufficiently narrow - band ones ( 1khz ) , in comparison with the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in order to improve the accuracy of their determination from experimental results .",
    "therefore , the weight function @xmath72 can also be considered narrow - band from both arguments as compared with the kinetic function @xmath73 from corresponding arguments . in this case",
    "we can approximate the weight volume @xmath57 as : @xmath74 the function @xmath61 is concentrated near @xmath75 [ _ berngardt and potekhin_,2000 ] .",
    "the width of this function from arguments @xmath76 is @xmath77 , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , is the width of bands of sounder signal spectra and of the spectral processing window , respectively . in this experiment on ionospheric",
    "sounding by the incoherent scatter method , they have the order @xmath80 . the function @xmath73 at a fixed @xmath81 for a typical ionospheric plasma with @xmath82 ions and @xmath83 is presented in figure  [ figtwo ] .",
    "the figure shows that the function @xmath73 does varies smoothly on the characteristic size of the weight function @xmath61 carrier in @xmath69 which is in this case has the order of @xmath84 ( corresponds to a sounding by the impulse radio signal of a duration of 1 millisecond ) .",
    "assuming that the envelope of the sounder pulse @xmath85 and the receiving window @xmath86 have an identical gaussian - like spectrum : @xmath87 , we obtain the function @xmath61 of the form @xmath88 upon substituting ( [ eq : model1 ] ) into ( [ eq : kern_model_modified ] ) and rather unwieldy calculations , similar to [ _ landau _ , 1946 ] , we obtain the following expression for the scattered signal spectrum ( [ eq : signal_model ] ) :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 the selective properties of @xmath57 in the longitudinal component of the velocity @xmath93 are determined by the first cofactor @xmath94 in ( [ eq : modified_kernel ] ) .",

    "from ( [ eq : simpl_model ] ) it follows that the fine structure of the scattered signal spectrum @xmath59 is determined only by the properties of the function @xmath110 ( [ eq : f_integral ] ) and can be related to the inpd @xmath53 only within the framework of additional assumptions about the structure of @xmath53 .",
    "formally , to determine the function @xmath53 require measuring the scattered signal for different wave numbers @xmath9 of the sounder signal simultaneously .    to carry out a qualitative comparison with experimental spectra of incoherently - scattered signals we use the spectral processing window that repeats the sounder signal shape .",
    "their spectra are approximated by gaussian - like spectra with a width equal to their actual spectrum width . according to ( [ eq : simpl_model ] )",

    "<S> the notion of the weight volume is introduced to define the domain of wave vectors and velocities in the spatial spectrum of the ions number phase density which makes the main contribution to the formation of the scattered signal . </S>",
    "<S> this weight volume depends on the antenna pattern , the form of the sounding signal , and on the time window of spectral processing , as well as on ionospheric plasma macroscopic parameters : electron and ion temperatures , ion composition , and the drift velocity . within the context of additional assumption about the ions number phase density </S>",
    "<S> , the proposed model was tested by the data from the irkutsk incoherent scatter radar . </S>",
    "<S> the test showed a good fit of the model to experiment . </S>"
