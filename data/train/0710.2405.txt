    "many real systems can be viewed as a combination of slow and fast motions which leads to complicated double scale equations . already in the 19th century in applications to celestial mechanics it was well understood ( though without rigorous justification ) that a good approximation of the slow motion can be obtained by averaging its parameters in fast variables .",
    "later , averaging methods were applied in signal processing and , rather recently , to model climate  weather interactions ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the classical setup of averaging justified rigorously in @xcite presumes that the fast motion does not depend on the slow one and most of the work on averaging treats this case only . on the other hand , in real systems",
    "both slow and fast motions depend on each other which leads to the more difficult fully coupled case which we study here .",
    "this setup emerges , in particular , in perturbations of hamiltonian systems which leads to fast motions on manifolds of constant energy and slow motions across them .    in this work",
    "we consider a system of differential equations for @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8 with initial conditions @xmath9 on the product @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a compact @xmath12-dimensional @xmath13 riemannian manifold and @xmath14 are smooth in @xmath15 families of bounded vector fields on @xmath16 and on @xmath17 respectively , so that @xmath18 serves as a parameter for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "the solutions of ( [ 1.1.1 ] ) determine the flow of diffeomorphisms @xmath22 on @xmath10 acting by @xmath23 .",
    "taking @xmath24 we arrive at the flow @xmath25 acting by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is another family of flows given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the solution of @xmath30 it is natural to view the flow @xmath31 as describing an idealised physical system where parameters @xmath32 are assumed to be constants ( integrals ) of motion while the perturbed flow @xmath22 is regarded as describing a real system where evolution of these parameters is also taken into consideration .",
    "essentially , the proofs of this paper work also in the slightly more general case when @xmath19 and @xmath21 in ( [ 1.1.1 ] ) together with their derivatives depend lipschitz continuously on @xmath33 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) but in order to simplify notations and estimates we do not consider this generalisation here .",
    "assume that the limit @xmath34 exists and it is the same for `` many '' @xmath35s .",
    "for instance , suppose that @xmath36 is an ergodic invariant measure of the flow @xmath27 then the limit ( [ 1.1.3 ] ) exists for @xmath37almost all @xmath18 and is equal to @xmath38 if @xmath39 does not , in fact , depend on @xmath20 then @xmath40 and @xmath41 are also independent of @xmath20 and we arrive at the classical uncoupled setup . in this case",
    "lipschitz continuity of @xmath19 implies already that @xmath42 is also lipshitz continuous in @xmath20 , and so there exists a unique solution @xmath43 of the averaged equation @xmath44 in this case the standard averaging principle says ( see @xcite ) that for @xmath45-almost all @xmath18 , @xmath46    as the main motivation for the study of averaging is the setup of perturbations described above we have to deal in real problems with the fully coupled system ( [ 1.1.1 ] ) which only in very special situations can be reduced by some change of variables to a much easier uncoupled case where the fast motion does not depend on the slow one .",
    "observe that in the general case ( [ 1.1.1 ] ) the averaged vector field @xmath47 in ( [ 1.1.3 ] ) may even not be continuous in @xmath20 , let alone lipschitz , and so ( [ 1.1.4 ] ) may have many solutions or none at all . moreover",
    ", there may exist no natural well dependent on @xmath48 family of invariant measures @xmath36 since dynamical systems @xmath27 may have rather different properties for different @xmath20 s .",
    "even when all measures @xmath36 are the same the averaging principle often does not hold true in the form ( [ 1.1.5 ] ) , for instance , in the presence of resonances ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "thus even basic results on approximation of the slow motion by the averaged one in the fully coupled case can not be taken for granted and they should be formulated in a different way requiring usually stronger and more specific assumptions .",
    "if convergence in ( [ 1.1.3 ] ) is uniform in @xmath20 and @xmath18 then ( see , for instance , @xcite ) any limit point @xmath49 as @xmath50 of @xmath51 is a solution of the averaged equation @xmath52 it is known that the limit in ( [ 1.1.3 ] ) is uniform in @xmath18 if and only if the flow @xmath27 on @xmath11 is uniquely ergodic , i.e. it possesses a unique invariant measure , which occurs rather rarely .",
    "thus , the uniform convergence in ( [ 1.1.3 ] ) assumption is too restrictive and excludes many interesting cases . probably , the first relatively general result on fully coupled averaging is due to anosov @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "relying on the liouville theorem he showed that if each flow @xmath27 preserves a probability measure @xmath36 on @xmath11 having a @xmath53 dependent on @xmath20 density with respect to the riemannian volume @xmath54 on @xmath11 and @xmath36 is ergodic for lebesgue almost all @xmath20 then for any @xmath55 @xmath56 where mes is the product of @xmath54 and the lebesgue measure in a relatively compact domain @xmath57 .",
    "an example in appendix to @xcite shows that , in general , this convergence in measure can not be strengthened to the convergence for almost all initial conditions and , moreover , in this example the convergence ( [ 1.1.5 ] ) does not hold true for any initial condition from a large open domain .",
    "such examples exist due to the presence of resonances , more specifically to the `` capture into resonance '' phenomenon , which is rather well understood in perturbations of integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "resonances lead there to the wealth of ergodic invariant measures and to different time and space averaging .",
    "it turns out ( see @xcite ) that wealth of ergodic invariant measures with nice properties ( such as gibbs measures ) for axiom a and expanding dynamical systems also yields in the fully coupled averaging setup with the latter fast motions examples of nonconvergence as @xmath50 for large sets of initial conditions ( see remark [ rem1.2.12 ] ) .    in hamiltonian systems , which are a classical object for applications of averaging methods ,",
    "the whole space is fibered into manifolds of constant energy .",
    "for some mechanical systems these manifolds have negative curvature with respect to the natural metric and their motion is described by geodesic flows there .",
    "hyperbolic hamiltonian systems were discussed , for instance , in @xcite and a specific example of a particle in a magnetic field leading to such systems was considered recently in @xcite .",
    "of course , these lead to hamiltonian systems which are far from integrable .",
    "such situations fall in our framework and they are among main motivations for this work .",
    "this suggests to consider the equation ( [ 1.1.1 ] ) on a ( locally trivial ) fiber bundle @xmath58 with a base @xmath59 being an open subset in a riemannian manifold @xmath60 and fibers @xmath61 being diffeomorphic compact riemannian manifolds ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand , @xmath62 has a local product structure and if @xmath63 is bounded then the slow motion stays in one chart during time intervals of order @xmath64 with @xmath65 small enough .",
    "hence , studying behavior of solutions of ( [ 1.1.1 ] ) on each such time interval separately we come back to the product space @xmath10 setup and will only have to piece results together to see the picture on a larger time interval of length @xmath66    we assume in the first part of this work that @xmath39 is @xmath13 in @xmath20 and @xmath18 and that for each @xmath20 in a closure of a relatively compact domain @xmath67 the flow @xmath27 is anosov or , more generally , axiom a in a neighborhood of an attractor @xmath68 let @xmath69 be the sinai - ruelle - bowen ( srb ) invariant measure of @xmath27 on @xmath70 and set @xmath71 it is known ( see @xcite ) that the vector field @xmath47 is lipschitz continuous in @xmath72 and so the averaged equations ( [ 1.1.4 ] ) and ( [ 1.1.6 ] ) have unique solutions @xmath73 and @xmath74 still , in general , the measures @xmath69 are singular with respect to the riemannian volume on @xmath11 , and so the method of @xcite can not be applied here .",
    "we proved in @xcite that , nevertheless , ( [ 1.1.7 ] ) still holds true in this case , as well , and , moreover , the measure in ( [ 1.1.7 ] ) can be estimated by @xmath75 with some @xmath76 .",
    "the convergence ( [ 1.1.7 ] ) itself without an exponential estimate can be proved by another method ( see @xcite ) which can be applied also to some partially hyperbolic fast motions .",
    "an extension of the averaging principle in the sense of convergence of young measures is discussed in section [ sec1.11 ] .",
    "once the convergence of @xmath51 to @xmath77 as @xmath50 is established it is interesting to study the asymptotic behavior of the normalized error @xmath78.\\ ] ] namely , in our situation it is natural to study the distributions @xmath79 as @xmath50 where @xmath54 is the normalized riemannian volume on @xmath11 and @xmath80 is a borel subset in the space @xmath81 of continuous paths @xmath82 $ ] on @xmath83 we will obtain in this work large deviations bounds for @xmath84 which will give , in particular , the result from @xcite saying that @xmath85 exponentially fast in @xmath5 where @xmath86 is the uniform norm on @xmath87 however , the main goal of this work is not to provide another derivation of ( [ 1.1.9 ] ) but to obtain precise upper and lower large deviations bounds which not only estimate measure of sets of initial conditions for which the slow motion @xmath88 exhibits substantially different behavior than the averaged one @xmath89 but also enable us to go further and to investigate much longer exponential in @xmath5 time behavior of @xmath88 .",
    "namely , we will be able to study exits of the slow motion from a neighborhood of an attractor of the averaged one and transitions of @xmath88 between basins of attractors of @xmath89 .",
    "such evolution , which becomes visible only on much longer than @xmath5 time scales , is usually called adiabatic in the framework of averaging . in the simpler case when the fast motion does not depend on the slow one",
    "such results were discussed in @xcite .",
    "still , even in this uncoupled situation descriptions of transitions of the slow motion between attractors of the averaged one were not justified rigorously both in the markov processes case of @xcite and in the dynamical systems case of @xcite .",
    "extending these technique to three scale equations may exhibit stochastic resonance type phenomena producing a nearly periodic motion of the slowest motion which is described in section [ sec1.10 ] below .",
    "these problems seem to be important in the study of climate  weather interactions and they were discussed in @xcite and @xcite in the framework of a model describing transitions between steady climatic states with weather evolving as a fast chaotic system and climate playing the role of the slow motion . such `` very long '' time description of the slow motion is usually impossible in the traditional averaging setup which deals with perturbations of integrable hamiltonian systems . in the fully coupled situation we can not work just with one hyperbolic flow but have to consider continuously changing fast motions which requires a special technique . in particular , the full flow @xmath22 on @xmath10 defined above and viewed as a small perturbation of the partially hyperbolic system @xmath31 plays an important role in our considerations .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the `` very long time '' behavior of the slow motion which requires certain `` markov property type '' arguments still can be described in the fully coupled setup which involves continuously changing fast hyperbolic motions .",
    "it turns out that the perturbed system still possesses semi - invariant expanding cones and foliations and a certain volume lemma type result on expanding leaves plays an important role in our argument for transition from small time were perturbation techniques still works to the long and `` very long '' time estimates .",
    "it is plausible that moderate deviations type results can be proved for @xmath90 when @xmath91 and that the distribution of @xmath92 in @xmath18 converges to the distribution of a gaussian diffusion process in @xmath16 .",
    "still , this requires somewhat different methods and it will not be discussed here . in this regard",
    "we can mention limit theorems obtained in @xcite for a system of two heavy and light particles which leads to an averaging setup for a billiard flow . for the simpler case when @xmath21 does not depend on @xmath72 i.e. when",
    "all flows @xmath93 are the same , the moderate deviations and gaussian approximations results were obtained previously in @xcite . related results in this uncoupled situation concerning hasselmann s nonlinear ( strong ) diffusion approximation of the slow motion @xmath2",
    "were obtained in @xcite .",
    "we consider also the discrete time case where ( [ 1.1.1 ] ) is replaced by difference equations for sequences @xmath94 and",
    "@xmath95 so that @xmath96 where @xmath97 is lipschitz in both variables and the maps @xmath98 are smooth and depend smoothly on the parameter @xmath48 . introducing the map @xmath99 we can also view this setup as a perturbation of the map @xmath100 describing an ideal system where parameters @xmath48 do not change . assuming that @xmath101 are @xmath13 depending on @xmath20 families of either @xmath13 expanding transformations or @xmath13 axiom a diffeomorphisms in a neighborhood of an attractor @xmath70 we will derive large deviations estimates for the difference @xmath102 where @xmath103 solves the equation @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath69 is the corresponding srb invariant measure of @xmath106 on @xmath70 .",
    "the discrete time results are obtained , essentially , by simplifications of the corresponding arguments in the continuous time case which enable us to describe `` very long '' time behavior of the slow motion also in the discrete time case .",
    "since our methods work not only for fast motions being axiom a diffeomorphisms but also when they are expanding transformations we can construct simple examples satisfying conditions of our theorems and exhibiting corresponding effects . in particular , we produce in section [ sec1.9 ] computational examples which demonstrate transitions of the slow motion between neighborhoods of attractors of the averaged system .    a series of related results for the case when ordinary differential equations in ( [ 1.1.1 ] ) are replaced by fully coupled stochastic differential equations appeared in @xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "hasselmann s nonlinear ( strong ) diffusion approximation of the slow motion in the fully coupled stochastic differential equations setup was justified in @xcite . when the fast process does not depend on the slow one",
    "such results were obtained in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . especially relevant for our results here",
    "is @xcite and we employ some elements of the probabilistic strategy from this paper .",
    "still , the methods there are quite different from ours and they are based heavily , first , on the markov property of processes emerging there and , secondly , on uniformity and nondegeneracy of the fast diffusion term assumptions which can not be satisfied in our circumstances as our deterministic fast motions are very degenerate from this point of view .",
    "note that the proof in @xcite contains a vicious cycle and substantial gaps which recently were essentially fixed in @xcite .",
    "some of the dynamical systems technique here resembles @xcite but the dependence of the fast motion on the slow one complicates the analysis substantially and requires additional machinery . a series of results on cramer s type asymptotics for fully coupled averaging with axiom a diffeomorphisms as fast motions appeared recently in @xcite@xcite .",
    "observe that the methods there do not work for continuous time axiom a dynamical systems considered here , they can not lead , in principle , to the standard large deviations estimates of our work and they deal with deviations of @xmath2 from the averaged motion only at the last moment and not of its whole path . various limit theorems for the difference equations setup ( [ 1.1.10 ] ) with partially hyperbolic fast motions were obtained recently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the study of deviations from the averaged motion in the fully coupled case seems to be quite important for applications , especially , from phenomenological point of view .",
    "in addition to perturbations of hamiltonian systems mentioned above there are many non hamiltonian systems which are naturally to consider from the beginning as a combination of fast and slow motions .",
    "for instance , hasselmann @xcite based his model of weather  climate interaction on the assumption that weather is a fast chaotic motion depending on climate as a slow motion which differs from the corresponding averaged motion mainly by a diffusion term .",
    "though , as shown in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , this diffusion error term does not help in the study of large deviations which are responsible for rare transitions of the slow motion between attractors of the averaged one , the latter phenomenon can be described in our framework and it seems to be important in certain models of climate fluctuations ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "very slow nearly periodic motions appearing in the stochastic resonance framework considered in section [ sec1.10 ] may also fit into this subject in the discussion on `` ice ages '' .",
    "of course , it is hard to believe that real world chaotic systems can be described precisely by an anosov or axiom a flow but one may take comfort in the chaotic hypothesis @xcite : `` a chaotic mechanical system can be regarded for practical purposes as a topologically mixing anosov system '' .      many real systems can be viewed as a combination of slow and fast motions which leads to complicated double scale equations .",
    "already in the 19th century in applications to celestial mechanics it was well understood ( though without rigorous justification ) that a good approximation of the slow motion can be obtained by averaging its parameters in fast variables .",
    "later , averaging methods were applied in signal processing and , rather recently , to model climate  weather interactions ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the classical setup of averaging justified rigorously in @xcite presumes that the fast motion does not depend on the slow one and most of the work on averaging treats this case only . on the other hand , in real systems",
    "both slow and fast motions depend on each other which leads to the more difficult fully coupled case which we study here .",
    "this setup emerges , in particular , in perturbations of hamiltonian systems which leads to fast motions on manifolds of constant energy and slow motions across them .",
    "it is natural to view double scale models as describing physical systems considered as perturbations of an idealized one which depends on parameters @xmath2466 assumed to be constants ( integrals ) of motion . in part [ part2 ]",
    "we suppose that the evolution of this idealized sistem is described by certain family of markov processes @xmath2467 on a separable metric space @xmath11 . in the perturbed system parameters start changing slowly in time and we assume that the corresponding slow motion @xmath2468 is described by an ordinary differential equations in @xmath16 having the form @xmath2469 where @xmath2470 is lipschitz continuous and the fast motion @xmath2471 evolves on @xmath11 , it depends , in general , on the slow one and tends to @xmath2472 as @xmath50 .",
    "usually , @xmath2473 is determined by certain equations , in general , coupled with ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) which means that their coefficients depend on the slow motion @xmath2474 .",
    "assume that a nonrandom limit @xmath2475 exists in some sense , it `` essentially '' does not depend on @xmath18 and it depends lipschitz continuously on @xmath20 .",
    "then there exists a unique solution @xmath2476 of the averaged equation @xmath2477 the averaging principle suggests that often @xmath2478 in some sense .",
    "if unperturbed motions @xmath2479 do not depend on the slow variables @xmath20 and @xmath2479 then the averaged principle holds true under quite general circumstances but when the fast motion depends on the slow one ( coupled case ) the situation becomes more complicated and approximation of @xmath2480 by @xmath2481 in the weak or the average sense was justified under some conditions in@xcite and @xcite .",
    "an extension of the averaging principle in the sense of convergence of young measures is discussed in section [ sec2.9 ] below .    in this work",
    "we are interested in large deviations bounds for probabilities that the time changed slow motion @xmath2482 belongs to various sets of curves which leads , in particular , to exponential bounds of the form @xmath2483 where @xmath2393 satisfies @xmath2484 when the fast motion do not depend on the slow one such results were obtained in @xcite and @xcite but the coupled case was dealt with much later in @xcite though ( as we indicated this to the author ) the proof there contained a vicious circle and substantial gaps which , essentially , were fixed recently in @xcite .",
    "still , @xcite is rather difficult to follow and we find it useful to provide a precise and consistent exposition of this important result which also deals with a more general case including fast motions being random evolutions whose extreme partial cases are diffusions and finite markov chains with continuous time .",
    "moreover , we go beyond bounded time large deviations and describe the adiabatic behaviour of the slow motion @xmath88 on exponentially large in @xmath5 time intervals such as its exits from a domain of attraction and transitions between attractors of the averaged system ( [ 2.1.6 ] ) .",
    "we observe that essentially the same proof yields the same results for a bit more general case when both @xmath19 in [ 2.1.1 ] and the coefficients of the random evolutions in the next section depend also lipschitz continuously on @xmath33 .",
    "we consider also the discrete time case where ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) is replaced by a difference equation of the form @xmath2485 where @xmath368 is the same as in ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) and the fast motion @xmath2486 is a perturbation of a family @xmath2487 of markov chains parametrized by @xmath48 . for somewhat less general discrete time situation",
    "large diviations bounds were obtained in @xcite by a simpler approach but in our more general situation we can rely only on methods similar to the continuous time case . moreover , unlike @xcite we go farther and study also very long time `` adiabatic '' behaviour of the slow motion similar to the continuous time case and illustrate some of the results by computer simulations for simple models .",
    "the strategy and many of arguments in part [ part2 ] are rather similar to part [ part1 ] where deterministic chaotic fast motions such as anosov and axiom a systems were considered . still , in view of the heavy dynamical systems background and machinery part [ part1 ] is hardly accessible for most of probabilists . by this reason we give full proofs here refering to part [ part1 ] only for proofs of some general results on large deviations , rate functionals and some others which do not rely on the specific dynamical systems setup .",
