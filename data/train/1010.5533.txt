    "in quantum information and quantum computing the physical unit of information is a microscopic quantum system and the information is encoded in its state @xcite .",
    "if the system is isolated , all of its properties are described by a pure state .",
    "the fundamental property of a pure state is that it can always be expressed as a coherent superposition of linearly independent states which , for instance , gives account of the accurate quantum interference phenomenon @xcite .",
    "if the system is not isolated then , in general , it is correlated with an uncontrollable quantum system , usually called environment , which introduces decoherence to the state of the system @xcite . in this case the effective state of the system can be described by a mixed state which consists of an incoherent superposition of possible states .",
    "in addition , the partial knowledge of the state of a system that belongs to a reservoir also is required to be effectively described by a mixed state .",
    "whatever be the cause for a mixed state , it has the fundamental property of having an infinite number of decompositions .",
    "there are some properties that do not depend on the considered decomposition , for instance , eigenvalues , eigenstates , observable - average , purity , and entropy .",
    "however , nonorthogonal quantum state discrimination protocol makes use of a mixed composition of the possible prepared states averaged on their _ a priori _ probabilities .",
    "thus , because of the fundamental property of having an infinite number of decompositions one could discriminate not only the prepared states but also another set of nonorthogonal states belonging to another decomposition of the prepared mix . on the other hand , the entanglement average for a bipartite system depends on the considered decomposition .",
    "since the entanglement is understood as the quantification of resources needed to create a given entangled state , a value of the entanglement of formation of a mixed state is then defined to be the average entanglement of the pure - state decomposition , minimized over all possible decompositions @xcite . in this form ,",
    "the mathematical - decomposition property is a nonclassical characteristic @xcite and becomes of fundamental physical interest .",
    "when the state belongs to a set of linearly independent ( li ) and nonorthogonal states , it can be recognized conclusively with a probability different from zero @xcite .",
    "another strategy allows a minimum - error tolerance for discriminating the state @xcite . in the simplest case the state is in a two - dimensional hilbert space and only two different states",
    "are li . in a hilbert space with dimension",
    "higher than two , the states require additional constraints to be li @xcite . in order to simplify the study of the addressed problem we have considered a rank - two mixed state . in this work",
    "we relate the li pure - state decomposition property of a given mixed state to the unambiguous quantum state discrimination ( uqsd ) protocol for two nonorthogonal states .",
    "we consider a quantum system prepared in a mixed state whose spectral decomposition is given by @xmath0 being @xmath1 the eigenstates and @xmath2 the eigenvalues respectively .",

    "we shall assume @xmath6 or @xmath7 to be different from zero .",
    "this spectral - decomposition is unique and its purity is completely characterized by the eigenvalues .",
    "however , there are infinite possible _ pure - state decompositions _ for the same mixed state @xcite . here",
    "we introduce two nonorthogonal states @xmath8 and @xmath9 with inner product @xmath10",
    ". in terms of these states and their biorthogonal ones @xcite the identity can be represented as follows : @xmath11 this expression becomes the well known canonical one for @xmath12 .",

    "after some algebra we obtain    @xmath17    [ p1p2 ]    satisfying @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we note that @xmath15 , as a function of @xmath20 , is monotonically increasing ( for @xmath21 ) or decreasing ( for @xmath22 ) enclosed by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath20-decomposition states become    @xmath23    [ beta1beta2 ]    where the @xmath24 parameter is the component of the @xmath25 eigenstate in the @xmath8 state , in short @xmath26 , and the phase @xmath27 is the relative phase of the allowed @xmath28 states . from the ( [ beta1beta2 ] ) expressions",
    "we realize that the inner product between the allowed @xmath28-decomposition states is given by @xmath29 we notice that , as is evident , when @xmath30 all the possible decompositions are one half of the identity since in this case we get @xmath31 as well , and all the possible sets @xmath28 are given by the orthogonal states :    @xmath32    from now on we assume @xmath33 .",
    "on the other hand , the ( [ rho - lambda ] ) spectral - decomposition is recovered for both values @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the modulus of the overlap ( [ ppbeta ] ) is a convex function of @xmath20 being zero for @xmath35 , @xmath36 and its maximum value is reached for @xmath37 in this case the decomposition corresponds to the _ balanced _",
