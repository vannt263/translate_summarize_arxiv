    "first of all , we would like to mention what implications are drawn from the analyses of the transverse momentum spectrum at @xmath0 tev by the cdf collaboration .",
    "authors of the cdf collaboration have reported interesting data on the transverse momentum distributions ( @xmath1 charged hadrons @xmath2 ) at @xmath0 tev @xcite . to explain those data , they adopted an inverse power law , given by qcd calculus as follows @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are free parameters that are estimated using experimental data ( for further information , see useful reviews in refs .",

    "( [ eq_qcd ] ) can not explain the data .",
    "thus , for charged particle production , a second term was introduced by the cdf collaboration as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are free parameters .",

    "( [ eq_qcd ] ) are possible . here",
    "we present our reanalyses using the statistical and systematic errors presented at durham hepdata @xcite .    herein , it is worthwhile to investigate the role of the single component model , i.e. , the non - extensive approach @xcite .",
    "the formula for this is as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are free parameters , and @xmath18 is named as the tsallis parameter .",

    "it should be stressed that eq .",

    "( [ eq_next ] ) is similar to that of eq .",
    "( [ eq_qcd ] ) .    moreover , the atlas collaboration proposed the following formula @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the centrality of pseudorapidity @xmath23 , @xmath19 is the parameter introduced in eq .",
