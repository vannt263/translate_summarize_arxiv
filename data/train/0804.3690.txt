    "@xcite also proved that every finite graph with maximum degree @xmath6 is a unit - distance graph in @xmath69 , which was improved to @xmath70 by @xcite .",

    "that is , some vertex in @xmath85 coincides with the closure of some edge of @xmath86 , or vice versa . since @xmath0 is finite , there are only finitely many bad rotations .",
    "since there are infinitely many rotations , there exists a rotation that is not bad .",
