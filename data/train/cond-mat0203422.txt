    "solid solutions of the relaxor - ferroelectrics ( 1-x)pb(mg@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath8-x pbtio@xmath3 and ( 1-x)pb(zn@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath3-x pbtio@xmath3 , known as pmn - xpt and pzn - xpt , respectively , are under active consideration for a new generation of electromechanical devices .",
    "when properly oriented , they have piezoelectric coefficients which are the highest yet reported , with electromechanical deformations one order - of - magnitude larger than those of conventional high piezoelectric pbzro@xmath2-pbtio@xmath2 ( pzt ) ceramics @xcite .",
    "the exceptional electromechanical properties of these lead oxide - based solid solutions have long been known to be related to the nearly vertical phase boundary between the rhombohedral and the tetragonal phases , the so - called morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) , which is a common feature of the pbmeo@xmath3-pbtio@xmath3 systems @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of this unusual behavior remained unknown until recently , when a monoclinic phase was observed around the mpb of pzt , in between the rhombohedral and tetragonal phases @xcite .",
    "the monoclinic phase in pzt , with space group cm , has the unique axis @xmath9 along the [ 110 ] direction , and a unit cell that is doubled with respect to the primitive cubic one and rotated @xmath10 about the c - axis with respect to it .",
    "we designate this monoclinic phase as m@xmath11-type , following the notation of vanderbilt and cohen , who in a recent theoretical study derived for the first time a region of stability for ferroelectric monoclinic perovskites by an extension of the classic devonshire - landau expansion of the free energy to eighth - order @xcite . diffraction experiments with an electric field applied in - situ @xcite together with first - principles calculations @xcite on pzt ceramics have demonstrated a direct link between the m@xmath11 phase and the high electromechanical deformations in pzt due to rotation of the polarization between the [ 111 ] and [ 001 ] directions .",
    "this fact explains some other studies in which an enhancement of the piezoelectric properties of [ 001]-oriented rhombohedral pzt was reported@xcite    first - principles calculations@xcite have also shown that the anomalously high strain values observed in rhombohedral pzn - xpt crystals under a [ 001]-electric field @xcitecan be attributed to polarization rotation from the rhombohedral [ 111 ] to the tetragonal [ 001 ] polar axis .",
    "diffraction experiments with an electric field applied in - situ @xcite have permitted the direct observation of such polarization rotation paths , and have shown that for rhombohedral pzn-8pt , which has a composition very close to the mpb , a _",
    "different _ monoclinic phase ( m@xmath5 in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is induced when an electric field is applied along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "the m@xmath5 phase has the pm space group , with the unique axis @xmath9 oriented along the pseudo - cubic [ 010 ] direction . with increasing electric field",
    ", the m@xmath5 phase becomes less distorted and approaches tetragonal symmetry but when the field is decreased to zero , an orthorhombic ( o ) phase is reached , similar to that of batio@xmath3 , which can be viewed as an m@xmath5 phase with @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the appearance of this irreversibly - induced o phase in pzn-8pt suggested that an orthorhombic phase would probably exist close by in this region of the phase diagram .",
    "shortly afterwards , x - ray powder diffraction experiments @xcite did in fact reveal the existence of such an o phase in a narrow composition region ( 8%@xmath13 x @xmath1411% ) between the rhombohedral ( r ) and tetragonal ( t ) phases in the pzn - xpt phase diagram .",
    "the o phase can be regarded as being very close in energy to the m@xmath5 phase for the following two reasons ; first , a very small elecric field is enough to induce the o - m@xmath5 transformation @xcite and , second , one of the four pzn-9%pt samples studied by uesu et al .",
    "@xcite showed m@xmath5 symmetry rather than o.    the mpb phases of the piezoelectric system pmn - xpt@xcite have not been extensively studied until the last two years , during which a series of papers on this material have appeared .",
    "pmn-33%pt single crystals poled along the [ 011 ] direction appear to be orthorhombic @xcite , while x - ray diffraction experiments have shown that a pmn-35%pt crystal poled along the [ 001 ] directions has m@xmath11-type monoclinic symmetry , similar to that of pzt@xcite .",
    "this latter work also reports that unpoled pmn-35%pt single crystals are purely rhombohedral , in contrastr to previous optical microscopy studies of crystals of the same nominal composition which reported that they display a complicated pattern of rhombohedral and tetragonal domains @xcite . very recently ,",
    "fascinating domain patterns , arising from different monoclinic phases with different polarization directions , have been observed by xu et al . in a pmn-33%pt crystal @xcite .",
    "in addition , both neutron @xcite and x - ray @xcite powder diffraction measurements have revealed the existence of a monoclinic phase of m@xmath5-type , in pmn-35%pt at low temperatures , and in pmn-34%pt at room temperature , respectively .",
    "all these results indicate that the behaviour of pmn - xpt around the mpb is very complicated and requires more systematic studies to be properly understood .    in the present work we report a high - resolution synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction study on pmn - xpt ceramic samples of several compositions as a function of temperature around the mpb .",
    "an intermediate monoclinic phase of m@xmath5 type has been observed in agreement with previous reports @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to these latter results , it has been found that the monoclinic phase does not exist as a single phase in any of the samples studied .",
    "the present study has allowed us to determine the region of stability of the intermediate phase and to construct a new phase diagram for pmn - xpt .",
    "samples of ( 1-x)pbmg@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2-xpbtio@xmath2 with x=0.30 , 0.31 , 0.33 , 0.35 , 0.37 and 0.39 ( hereafter designated xpt , with x in % ) were synthesized using the two - step columbite precursor technique @xcite .",
    "the starting reagents were oxide powders with purities better than 99.9% .",
    "in the first step , a mixture of mgo and nb@xmath15o@xmath16 containing a 15.5 wt% excess of mgo over the 1:1 stoichiometric proportions was thoroughly ground in ethanol and cold - pressed .",
    "the excess amount of mgo was added in order to compensate for subsequent weight losses at high temperatures as determined from a previous dta / tg analysis .",
    "the pellet was dried at @xmath17 c and calcined at @xmath18c for 12h to form pure mgnb@xmath15o@xmath19 of columbite structure . in the second step , this precursor powder was mixed with pbo and tio@xmath15 in the appropriate proportions and a 2 wt% excess of pbo added to compensate for the evaporation losses during the calcining and sintering processes .",
    "each composition was thoroughly ground and calcined at @xmath20c for 4h to form the perovskite phase .",
    "the calcined powders were reground with the addition of a few drops of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) and cold - pressed into pellets about 3 mm thick and 15 mm in diameter , which were first heated to @xmath21c in an open pt crucible for 1h to drive off the pva , and then sintered at @xmath22c for 4h in an alumina crucible to form highly densified ceramics .",
    "the light yellow surfaces of the ceramic pellets were polished with fine diamond paste and ultrasonically cleaned .",
    "x - ray diffraction patterns obtained on a laboratory diffractometer with cu k@xmath23 confirmed the formation of perovskite - type phases with no evidence of any impurities .",
    "synchroton x - ray powder diffraction measurements were performed at beamline x7a at the brookhaven national synchrotron light source on several different occasions . in each case a double - crystal channel - cut si ( 111 ) monochromator was used in combination with a ge ( 220 ) analyzer and a scintillation detector .",
    "the wavelength was set to @xmath24 0.7   and calibrated with a si reference standard . with this configuration , the angular resolution is better than 0.01@xmath25 . in most cases",
    "the data were collected directly from the ceramic pellets in bragg - brentano geometry by carrying out step - scans at 0.005 or 0.01@xmath25 intervals over selected angular regions while the sample was rocked over a few degrees to improve powder averaging .",
    "this type of scan provides good counting rates but can result in incorrect intensity ratios if significant preferred orientation is present in the pellets .",
    "however , the peak positions and hence the derived unit cell parameters are not affected by this problem .",
    "temperature dependence measurements , between 20 and 500k , were performed with the samples loaded in a closed - cycle cryostat .",
    "a further set of measurements was made at room temperature on capillary samples which were rotated at about 1 hz during data collection .",
    "such data are free from preferred - orientation effects , but suffer from the disadvantage that the counting rates are quite slow . for this purpose ,",
    "a small piece of each pellet was carefully crushed and sieved , and the resulting 325 - 400 mesh fraction ( about 38 - 44 @xmath26 ) loaded into a thin glass - walled capillary of nominal diameter 0.2 mm @xcite . in most cases scans",
    "were carried out over narrow angular regions centered about the six pseudocubic reflections ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) , ( 111 ) , ( 200 ) , ( 220 ) and ( 222 ) , from which it is possible to determine unambiguously the crystal symmetry within the limits of the instrumental resolution , together with the corresponding lattice parameters and any zero offset if present .",
    "for the data analysis , the individual reflection profiles were fitted to a pseudo - voigt function appropriately corrected for asymmetry @xcite with intensity , peak position , peak - width ( fwhm ) and mixing parameter as variables . when appropriate , the peak widths and mixing parameters were constrained to be the same for all the peaks in a clump .",
    "additional peaks were added based on the difference patterns , the relative intensities and the goodness - of - fit residuals .",
    "compared to the standard rietveld technique of profile - matching , in which the full diffraction pattern is fitted without a structural model , the advantage of this procedure is that it does not require any assumptions about the phases to be included , how the fwhm and mixing parameters vary as a function of 2@xmath27 , and how to allow for anisotropic broadening , when neighboring peaks have significantly different widths .",
    "we have found that this is a fairly common effect in pbo - based perovskite systems , and is likely to occur when one or more of the lattice parameters is more sensitive to compositional fluctuations than the others .",
    "if overlooked , anisotropic broadening can be mistakenly interpreted as a lower - symmetry structure in a profile - matching analysis .",
    "some information about the microstructure and compositional fluctuations in the samples can be obtained from williamson - hall plots @xcite of the peak widths , which can be used to provide estimates of the mean coherence length , _",
    "_ , and fluctuations in the d - spacings , @xmath28d / d .",
    "the observed values of @xmath28d / d in the cubic phase are consistent with long - range compositional fluctuations in the samples of typically @xmath291% ( fwhm ) , based on the lattice parameters reported by noblanc et al.@xcite for compositions in the range 25 - 40pt .",
    "the temperature evolution of the lattice parameters for 30pt and 39pt is shown in fig 1 .",
    "these two compositions are located to the left and right sides , respectively , of the mpb in the pmn - xpt phase diagram , and the curie temperatures , t@xmath5 , are shown as vertical dotted lines .",
    "the determination of t@xmath5 , which is usually made from dielectric measurements , is difficult in this case due to the broadness of the dielectric constant peak . in this paper",
    "the t@xmath5 values have been adapted from those of noblanc et al .",
    "@xcite as the average of the two temperatures , t@xmath30 ( maximum ) and t@xmath31 ( depoling ) , obtained from dielectric measurements on poled samples , which produce better - defined dielectric anomalies .",
    "below their respective t@xmath5 s of about 400 k and 450 k , 39pt is tetragonal down to 20k , while 30pt is first tetragonal becoming rhombohedral at about 350k @xcite , and remaining so down to 20 k.        the diffraction profiles around the pseudo - cubic ( 111 ) , ( 200 ) and ( 220 ) diffraction peaks from 30pt and 39pt at 300k are shown in fig .",

    "2d , respectively , in which the least - squares fits to the data points are shown as solid lines and the peak positions by vertical arrows . in each case , the observed diffraction peaks show no evidence of phase coexistence ; however , an analysis of the peak broadening reveals that the two compositions behave quite differently .",
    "3 shows the respective williamson - hall plots @xcite , which have slopes of 2@xmath28d / d and intercepts of @xmath32@xmath33@xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the coherence length .",
    "while the 39pt composition shows isotropic broadening with @xmath28@xmath36 and a coherence length @xmath37 0.5 @xmath38 m , the 30pt composition shows highly anisotropic broadening and much smaller @xmath35 values , of about 0.2 @xmath38 m , as shown in fig .",
    "3 ( top ) . in the 30pt composition",
    ", the broadening is very small for the ( hhh ) peaks , with @xmath28@xmath39 , and most pronounced for the ( h00 ) peaks , with @xmath28@xmath40 an order - of - magnitude larger .",
    "this situation is very similar to that observed in the rhombohedral phase of pzt , in which a large degree of intrinsic disorder @xcite is known to exist due to the existence of local displacements of monoclinic type even though the long - range structure is rhombohedral @xcite .",
    "intermediate compositions gave considerably more complicated diffraction patterns , as can be seen in figs .",
    "2b and 2c for the 31pt and 33pt samples at 300k . from a detailed analysis of the peak positions and intensities of the fitted profiles , it was possible to identify a monoclinic phase of m@xmath5-type in the 31pt , 33pt , 35pt and 37pt compositions , similar to that reported by kiat et al.@xcite and singh et al @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of 31pt it can be seen in fig .",
    "2b that the profiles of the pseudo - cubic ( 200 ) and ( 220 ) reflections are distinctly different from those of 30pt shown in fig .",
    "various possibilities were considered to explain the observed peak positions and intensities of 31pt ; in particular the lower - symmetry phases previously found in this and related systems , i.e. orthorhombic o , monoclinic m@xmath11 and monoclinic m@xmath5 . among these , both o and m@xmath5 are found to account quite well for most of the observed features , while m@xmath11 can be ruled out altogether .",
    "however , there are several discrepancies in the intensity ratios which can only be accounted for by the presence of a minority rhombohedral phase , with an estimated volume fraction of about 30% .",
    "as mentioned earlier , o and m@xmath5 are closely related and very difficult to distinguish from each other , since the o phase simply represents the limiting case of the m@xmath5 phase when @xmath41=@xmath42 . in a diffraction pattern ,",
    "the difference between the two is most obvious for the pseudo - cubic ( 200 ) reflection , which would split into three peaks with roughly equal intensities for @xmath43 , but only two peaks with a 2:1 intensity ratio for o. in the case of 31pt , it is not immediately apparent whether the broad lower - angle peak is composed of one or two peaks ; however , we were able to obtain a significantly better fit with two peaks , which together with the rest of the monoclinic reflections , enabled the lattice parameters of the m@xmath5 phase to be determined with reasonable accuracy .",

    "it is noteworthy that the variation between @xmath9 and @xmath46 is continuous at the phase transition , in striking similarity to the behavior observed for the orthorhombic phase in pzn - xpt @xcite .",

    "as in the case of 31pt , identification of the fitted peaks was based upon consideration of the r , t , m@xmath11 , m@xmath5 and o phases , both alone and in various combinations . once again , the m@xmath5 phase was found to account satisfactorily for most of the peaks .",
    "compared to the m@xmath5 phase of 31pt ( fig .",

    "however , as before , there were several discrepancies in the intensity ratios and clear evidence of a low - angle shoulder on the ( h00 ) profiles which could only be explained by the presence of a minority phase , but in this case tetragonal instead of rhombohedral , with a volume fraction of about 25% .",

    "between 300 - 325k , the monoclinic phase transforms into a tetragonal one , which then transforms to the cubic phase between 400 - 425k , in agreement with the previously reported pmn - xpt phase diagram@xcite .",

    "2c ) , and thus follow a continuous trend with @xmath46 in the purely tetragonal phase at higher temperatures . @xmath47 follows a similar continuous trend at low temperatures with @xmath47 at higher temperatures .",

    "the behavior observed in 35pt is more complicated .",
    "the diffraction profiles around the pseudo - cubic ( 200 ) , ( 220 ) and ( 222 ) reflections are plotted in fig . 6 for the three different symmetry regions observed as a function of temperature : the cubic phase at 450k , the tetragonal phase at 400k , and the low temperature region at 20k .",
    "the strikingly broad features observed at low temperatures are in sharp contrast to the narrow and well - resolved peaks observed in the tetragonal and cubic phases .",
    "the high - angle peak in the ( 200 ) profile , which corresponds to the smallest lattice parameter , @xmath9 , shifts towards higher angles and remains relatively sharp .",
    "in contrast , the intensity in the lower - angle region becomes very broad and the fitting procedure becomes accordingly more difficult .",

    "2c for 33pt are clearly similar to those in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite for 34pt .",
    "in particular , there appears to be definite evidence of a low - angle shoulder in the pseudo - cubic ( 200 ) profile , and a high - angle shoulder in the ( 220 ) profile , both of which would imply the presence of a minority tetragonal phase in the latter sample .",
    "recent work by topolov @xcite shows that stress fields may play a very important role at the mpb .",
    "it therefore seems plausible that local internal strain due to lattice mismatching between coexisting phases is the cause for the observed broadening of the pseudo - cubic ( h00 ) profile in the m@xmath5 phase .",
    "this type of strain would produce a distribution of @xmath41 and @xmath42 lattice parameters that could explain the striking profiles seen for the 35pt sample at 20k and could include the limiting case of an orthorhombic phase for which @xmath41=@xmath42 .",
    "the fact that such a distribution is less evident in the other profiles ( see fig .",
    "6b - c ) is because the corresponding peak splittings are defined mainly by the monoclinic angle and the average values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 for ( hh0 ) , and exclusively by those values for ( hhh ) .",
    "it is also apparent that the existence of long - range compositional fluctuations about @xmath52 , indicated by williamson - hall plots for the cubic phases , as earlier described , can only partially explain the observed distribution of monoclinic lattice parameters .",
    "furthermore , in the context of the three - phase coexistence observed in 35pt at low temperatures , it is interesting to note that a degenerate point at which these three phases , t , o and m@xmath5 coexist has been predicted by vanderbilt and cohen @xcite in an eighth - order expansion of the free energy . although this degeneracy is actually an artifact of the model , and could be removed by considering higher - order terms in the devonshire expansion , it is reasonable to suppose that these three phases are extremely close in energy and can in fact coexist in real systems due to internal strain , thermal fluctuations , etc .",
    "the phase diagram reported in ref . may explain why the mpb of the pmn - xpt system ( around the t - m@xmath5-o `` degenerate '' point ) is considerably more complicated than that of pzt @xcite ( around the t - m@xmath11-r tricritical point ) or that of pzn - xpt@xcite ( around the r - o - t tricritical point ) .",

    "@xcite have reported a slightly lower disorder energy in pmn than in pzn . moreover",
    ", this disorder can be expected to increase at the mpb of the pmn - xpt system due to the larger ti content , and could also contribute to the exceptional anharmonicity of the free - energy surfaces @xcite , a feature believed to be related to the nature of the pb - o bond in these lead oxide solid solutions @xcite .",
    "there is the question of whether the observed phase coexistence , r+m@xmath5 , t+@xmath43 , or even t+@xmath43+o is an intrinsic feature of the pmn - xpt system .",
    "the previously - noted degree of compositional fluctuation might by itself explain the coexistence of m@xmath5 and r phases in 31pt , but not the coexistence of @xmath43 and t over a much wider range . according to the eighth - order devonshire expansion of the free energy @xcite",
    ", a phase transition between r and m@xmath5 can not occur directly and is only possible _ via _ an o phase @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have observed that 31pt is very close to orthorhombic , and it seems entirely plausible that compositions might be found between 30pt and 31pt which are truly orthorhombic , in which case the transition between r and m@xmath5 will indeed occur _ via _ the o phase .",
    "furthermore , according to the eighth - order theory@xcite , the @xmath43-t phase transition should be second - order , and no phase coexistence region should be observed .",
    "however , the o - t phase transition is first - order , and therefore the presence of an o phase could explain the wide region of m@xmath5+t phase coexistence observed .",
    "in fact , the existence of a minority third o phase , similar to that found in 35pt can not be neccesarily ruled out in 31pt , 33pt and 37pt , although in these cases we are unable to resolve it from the monoclinic phase . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible that the continuous character of the m@xmath5-t transition may be changed by considering higher - orders in the free energy expansion @xcite , since the landau conditions for second - order transitions that are fulfilled in this case are necessary but not sufficient @xcite .",
    "this would be more in accordance with the fairly abrupt changes in the lattice parameters , in special the order parameter @xmath44@xmath53 , observed at the transition as a function of composition , and the m@xmath5-t phase coexistence could be naturally explained .    to conclude ,",
    "a new phase diagram for pmn - xpt has been proposed which delimits the the composition range of the m@xmath5 phase near the mpb .",
    "the existence of a secondary phase , either tetragonal or rhombohedral , has been found in all cases ( 31%@xmath4 x@xmath4 37% ) .",
    "moreover , the presence of a third minority orthorhombic phase , observed for 35pt , can not be ruled out in the other monoclinic compositions , and could explain the observed phase coexistence of m@xmath5 and t. this complex landscape of phase mixtures , which is in agreement with the observations of xu et al .",
    "for 33pt single crystals @xcite , can not be explained simply by long - range compositional fluctuations in the sample and is believed to be an intrinsic feature of the pmn - xpt system .",
    "the evolution of the monoclinic lattice parameters as a function of composition shows that the m@xmath5 phase evolves from the o limit and approaches the t limit , indicating that the polarization rotates in the monoclinic ( 010 ) plane .",
    "however , the rotation appears to be discontinuous at both limits .",
    "the present results show that the mpb of the mpb system is characterized by multi - phase components and complex phase behavior .",
    "we hope that our observations will stimulate further experimental and theoretical work needed to clarify more precisely the nature of the mpb and its relationship to the electromechanical properties .",
