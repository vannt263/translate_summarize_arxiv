    "it is told that , the light deflection of a gravitational lens is caused by the gravity or in einstein s words the curved spacetime , while the light deflection of an optical lens is caused by the variance of refractive index of the medium .",
    "but is there any deeper similarity between the two lenses besides the deflection of light ?",
    "can we analyze the gravitational lensing as the conventional optical one ?",
    "in fact , people have long tried an optical description of the lensing effect . in 1920",
    ", eddington @xcite suggested that the light deflection in solar gravitational field can be conceived as a refraction effect of the space in a flat spacetime .",

    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 and the mass @xmath18 are all in astronomical scale ; therefore , the light of central imaging is extremely close to the lens center . for a lens matter system denser in the center , the possibility of the central imaging light to be blocked increases .",
    "the relatively longer inner path of the central imaging ray adds the possibility of scattering and absorption on the way . besides , the central image , if still exists , is relatively faint compared with the bright lens core .",
    "all these factors lead to little chance of finding the central image .",
    "this accounts for the central image missing in almost all observed cases of gravitational lensing .",
    "though we have successfully given a refractive index description of the gravitational lensing and solved a puzzling problem of it , there is still a doubt about the refraction property of the gravitational spacetime as shown in eq .",
    "the doubt can be eliminated if we consider that , around the gravitational matter , there exists a special medium  vacuum , which may have a graded refractive index in gravitational field .    a graded vacuum refractive index needs at least an influence of matter or field on the vacuum .",
    "it is exhilarating to see that the recent theoretical and experimental progresses in quantum vacuum have provided a strong support to such an influence .",
    "ahmadi and nouri - zonoz pointed out that under the influence of electromagnetic field , vacuum can be polarized , which has led to astonishingly precise agreement between predicted and observed values of the electron magnetic moment and lamb shift , and may have effects on the photon propagation @xcite .",
    "rikken and rizzo considered the anisotropy of the optical properties of the vacuum when a static magnetic field @xmath85 and a static electric field @xmath86 are simultaneously applied perpendicular to the direction of light propagation @xcite .",
    "they predicted that magnetoelectric birefringence will occur in vacuum under such conditions .",
    "they also demonstrated that the propagation of light in vacuum becomes anisotropic with the anisotropy in the refractive index being proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "et al_. studied the propagation of light in the neighborhood of magnetized neutron stars .",
    "they pointed out that the light emitted by background astronomical objects will be deviated due to the optical properties of quantum vacuum in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the fact that the light propagation in vacuum can be modified by applying electromagnetic fields to the vacuum indicates that vacuum is actually a special kind of optical medium @xcite .",
    "the similarity between the vacuum and the dielectric medium implies that vacuum must also have its inner structure , which could be influenced by matter or fields .",
    "actually , the structure of quantum vacuum has been investigated in quite a number of papers recently @xcite .",
    "besides the electromagnetic field , the existence of matter can also influence the vacuum .",
    "for example , the vacuum inside a microcavity is modified due to the existence of the cavity mirrors , which will alter the zero - point energy inside the cavity and cause an attractive force between the two mirrors known as casimir effect @xcite , which has been verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "the above said makes it natural to suppose that the refractive index of vacuum can be influenced by the gravitational matter .",
    "this thought is also supported by the theory of quantum fields , which tells us that particles are actually the excited vacuum . and it is unthinkable that the excited vacuum will exert no influence on the vacuum around .    in brief , we could relate the graded refraction property of the gravitational spacetime to the vacuum influenced by the gravitational matter .",
    "we have shown two strong similarities between the gravitational lensing and the conventional optical lensing : one is in the fermat s principle , the other is in light deflection formula .",
    "the similarities indicate a graded refractive index analysis of the gravitational lensing .",
    "we derived through the general relativity and the fermat s principle the general expression of this refractive index for a static spherically symmetric gravitational field . from this expression and the schwarzschild exterior and interior solutions , the exact refractive index profile is obtained . in weak field case , we got a simple unified exponential function of the gravitational potential for the calculation of the refractive index profile outside and inside the lens matter system . since the derivation is based on the general relativity , there is no inconsonance between the general relativity and our result . by using the obtained result , we investigated the gravitational lensing in a conventional optical way .",
    "some results from computer simulations interpreted the long puzzling problem of the central image missing in a clear way .",
    "we also suggested the graded refractive index of the gravitational spacetime be interpreted as that of the gravitational vacuum .",
