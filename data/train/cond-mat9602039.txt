    "there is a considerable body of literature discussing the way in which interfaces depin from surfaces [ ] . of particular interest to us here",
    "is the situation below the roughening transition when the interface is smooth and can depin from the surface through a series of first - order layering transitions .",
    "this possibility was first pointed out by de oliveira and griffiths [ ] for a model in which the layering is driven by the competition between a long - range bulk interaction and a surface field . here",
    "the layering transitions exist even at zero temperature .",
    "later duxbury and yeomans [ ] showed that , if the position of the interface relative to the surface was degenerate at zero temperature , the degeneracy could be split by thermal fluctuations giving an infinite series of layering transitions at finite temperatures .",
    "the stable interface position is determined as a balance between the binding effect of a bulk field and the entropic advantage for the interface lying further from the surface .",
    "the transverse ising model [ ] was first introduced by de gennes [ ] in connection with ferro - electric materials .",
    "recently henkel et .",
    "[ ] have discussed the behaviour of a domain wall in this system .",
    "the interesting questions concern the effect of _ quantum _ fluctuations , mediated by the transverse field , on the behaviour of the interface .",
    "their work considers one dimension where the interface is rough .",
    "very different behaviour is likely for a smooth interface .",
    "therefore in this paper we consider the behaviour of the three - dimensional transverse ising model below the roughening temperature .",
    "we find that a zero - temperature multiphase point can be split by quantum fluctuations and that , for a non - zero transverse field , there are an infinite number of stable positions for the interface as a bulk field passes through zero .",
    "the next section of the paper defines the model and gives a qualitative discussion of its properties and our approach .",
    "quantitative details of the calculation , which is based on quantum mechanical perturbation theory , are given in sec .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "the hamiltonian of the three - dimensional transverse ising model we shall consider is @xmath3 - k   \\sum_j \\biggl (   s_z ( 0,j ) - s_z(l+1,j ) \\biggr ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 labels two - dimensional planes and @xmath5 nearest neighbours within a plane .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is used to impose appropriate boundary conditions , namely to fix the spins at the surface ( @xmath7 ) to be up and those in the last layer ( @xmath8 ) to be down .",
    "these boundary conditions will create a domain wall , or interface , in the system separating layers of up and down spins ( see fig .",
    "our aim is to construct the phase diagram which gives the position , @xmath9 , of the interface ( defined as in fig .",
    "[ f2]a . ) as a function of the uniform field @xmath1 and the transverse field @xmath0 .",
    "we shall consider the limit @xmath10 and zero temperature where the interface is flat .    as a first step in understanding the phase diagram we consider the situation for @xmath11 .",
    "in this case it is clear that for positive @xmath1 , @xmath12 whereas for negative @xmath1 , @xmath13 .",
    "we shall call these phases , which are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , r and l respectively . for @xmath1=0",
    "the energy is independent of @xmath9 , so that all interface positions are degenerate .",
    "it is known that such a degeneracy can be lifted by either thermal fluctuations [ ] or by quantum fluctuations [ ] . in more general contexts this removal of degeneracy has been referred to as ground state selection [ ] following the work of villain and gordon [ ] and shender [ ] . here we will consider the effect of quantum fluctuations .",
    "there are two possibilities : in the first , quantum fluctuations due to nonzero @xmath0 cause the transition from l to r to be discontinuous with no intermediate states ; in the second this transition occurs through a sequence of intermediate states in which @xmath9 increases monotonically .",
    "this sequence can be finite , so that there is a first - order transition from a state with @xmath14 to r , or it can be infinite . in general , one expects the first possibility when the effective interaction between the surface and the interface is attractive and the second when this effective interaction is repulsive .",
    "our results indicate that quantum effects give rise to the second possibility and that the sequence of layering transitions is probably an infinite one .",
    "it is easy to see that even when @xmath0 is nonzero , the r phase is stable whenever @xmath1 is positive .",
    "as we will show , the stability of the l phase requires that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a constant .    to determine the interface position we must calculate the ground state energy as a function of @xmath1 . to do this",
    "we assume perfectly flat interfaces and apply perturbation theory to calculate the energy of the state when the interface is at position @xmath9 .",
    "if we were dealing with a finite system , then perturbation theory would introduce coupling in finite order between states when the interface is at different positions .",
    "however , this tunneling effect disappears in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our calculations are valid for @xmath17 .",
    "we also impose the condition @xmath18 , although as long as we remain in the regime where the interfaces are flat , this restriction is probably inessential .",
    "the energy per layer spin @xmath19 of the state when the interface is at position @xmath9 can be written @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy per layer spin for the @xmath13 phase .",
    "the most important dependence on @xmath1 is in the term @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath1 also contributes to the energy denominators that appear in perturbation theory , which are typically of the form @xmath23 .",
    "however perturbative contributions to @xmath24 , when expanded in powers of @xmath1 , lead to corrections which are of relative order @xmath25 or smaller .",
    "but since we will only be interested in @xmath1 in the range @xmath26 , these corrections are smaller than of relative order @xmath27 , which we may ignore .",
    "therefore , in eq .",
    "( [ wall ] ) , we may evaluate @xmath24 at @xmath28 .",
    "we shall find that @xmath29 is a positive and decreasing function of @xmath9 .",
    "this result leads to an infinite sequence of phase transitions . the critical field separating the phase @xmath9 from @xmath30",
    "is given by @xmath31 where , as argued above , the leading order calculation of @xmath29 can be obtained for @xmath28 .",
    "from eq . ( [ heq ] )",
    "it is clear that we only need to keep track of terms in the ground - state energy which depend on @xmath9 . in other words",
    "we need to ascertain how the corrections to the ground  state energy which are perturbative in @xmath0 depend on the location of the interface . for convenience",
    "we now transform to occupation number operators . for spins that are up ( down ) we write @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "also @xmath35 , where the operator @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) creates ( destroys ) a bose excitation at site @xmath4 in the @xmath38th layer and @xmath39 .",
    "strictly speaking we should not allow more than one excitation to exist on a single site . to enforce this restriction",
    "we include a term of the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "normally , it is difficult to take full account of such a hard - core interaction .",
    "as we will see , we accommodate this constraint by never involving matrix elements connecting to a state in which there is more than one excitation at any site .",
    "therefore , setting @xmath28 , we are lead to the following bosonic hamiltonian , when the interface is at position @xmath9 : @xmath42 \\biggr ) - \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\sum_{\\langle j , j'\\rangle } j_0 n_{i , j } n_{i , j ' } + \\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\sum_j a_{i , j}^\\dagger a_{i , j}^\\dagger a_{i , j } a_{i , j } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -j\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\sum_j [ - ( 1/2)(n_{i , j}+n_{i+1,j } ) + n_{i , j}n_{i+1,j } ] + j \\sum_j [ -n_{k , j } - n_{k+1,j } + 2n_{k , j } n_{k+1,j } ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the unperturbed energy of the @xmath13 phase , @xmath41 , and for @xmath6 , we may set @xmath44 .",
    "we write this hamiltonian as @xmath45 where @xmath46 with @xmath47 , @xmath48 @xmath49 \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath50 where @xmath51    and ( with @xmath41 ) @xmath52    we now consider how the perturbative contributions to the energy depend on the various coupling constants . to carry out this discussion it is convenient to introduce a diagrammatic representation of the contributions to the perturbation expansion .",
    "each term of @xmath53 proportional to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 ( and similarly @xmath56 ) denotes a position label of the form @xmath57 , is represented by a line joining the two interacting sites @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath58 or @xmath59 depending on whether sites @xmath55 and @xmath56 are in the same plane or are in adjacent planes .",
    "the perturbation in @xmath60 proportional to @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is represented by a minus ( plus ) sign at the site @xmath55 .",
    "however , for simplicity , since each site involved with any of the preceding interactions must be excited ( i. e. must have both a `` + '' and a `` - '' associated with it ) , we have not explicitly shown `` + '' s and `` - '' s in fig .",
    "the term in the perturbation @xmath63 proportional to @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) is represented by a circle attached to the site @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "any term in perturbation theory which does not involve @xmath68 can be constructed from these elements .",
    "some simple examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] .",
    "we now define what we mean by connected terms . any term which involves only a single site",
    "is connected .",
    "terms which involve more than one site are connected only if all such sites are connected with respect to lines representing terms of @xmath53 .",
    "if this is not the case , the term will be called disconnected . thus diagrams ( a ) and ( d ) of fig . [ f3 ] are disconnected .",
    "we now establish that contributions from disconnected configurations of lines vanish .",
    "consider a disconnected diagram @xmath69 which consists of two disjoint components , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the contribution of of this diagram is unchanged if we were to treat perturbatively the system @xmath72 in which all coupling constants @xmath73 not in @xmath70 or @xmath71 are set to zero .",
    "but because @xmath70 and @xmath71 are disjoint systems , we have @xmath74 .",
    "this result indicates that there are no disconnected terms in the ground state energy which involve simultaneously an exchange constant from one component @xmath70 and an exchange constant from the other component @xmath71 .",
    "thus disconnected diagrams can be omitted from further consideration .    to evaluate @xmath32",
    "it is apparent from the form of eq .",
    "( [ wall ] ) that we only need to keep contributions which appear when the interface is at position @xmath30 but not when it is at position @xmath9 .",
    "note that if the diagram does not involve the interface potential @xmath63 , it has no dependence on position and will make equal contributions in the two cases .",
    "so @xmath32 has contributions from diagrams which both a ) involve @xmath63 , the interface potential , and b ) can occur when the interface is at position @xmath30 but not at position @xmath9 .",
    "such a connected diagram must involve sites in rows 1 , 2 , ... @xmath30 . this can be done with diagrams involving @xmath9 or more lines . as we will see in a moment , the dominant contribution involves the least number of lines .",
    "to take the least number of lines , means that we take @xmath9 lines representing @xmath38 and no lines representing @xmath75 . thus the dominant diagrams are linear chain diagrams , and we may therefore consider a hamiltonian in which the index @xmath38 in eqs .",
    "( [ h0eq])([v4eq ] ) is omitted .",
    "we illustrate the diagrams with the minimum number of lines which contribute to @xmath32 for @xmath13 and @xmath76 in figs .",
    "[ f4 ] and [ f5 ] respectively .    to check that it is indeed the linear chain diagrams which give the lowest order contribution to @xmath32 it is necessary to give a more detailed analysis of the contribution of a diagram involving , say , @xmath77 different lines representing @xmath53 and , as we explained , necessarily involving at least one interface potential term @xmath63 . note that both these perturbations , @xmath53 and @xmath63 , involve occupation numbers @xmath78 , which vanish when there is no excitation at site @xmath55 .",
    "for every site @xmath55 involved in a @xmath53 or @xmath63 interaction , it is necessary to create an excitation so that @xmath78 can be evaluated in a virtual state in which @xmath79 .",
    "subsequently , in order to get back into the ground state we must destroy the excitation on the site @xmath55 .",
    "thus in all a diagram involving @xmath77 different lines will involve @xmath80 sites and therefore give rise to a perturbative contribution to the energy which is of order @xmath81 , where @xmath82 where of the @xmath77 lines , @xmath83 are associated with @xmath38 and @xmath84 with @xmath75 [ see eq .",
    "( [ v1eq ] ) ] . in writing this equation",
    "we included the factor @xmath85 to take account of the necessary factor of @xmath63 . at this point , it is clear that to have a diagram which occurs for position @xmath30 but not for @xmath9 it is best to invoke a linear diagram , and not one which reaches more than one row perpendicular to the interface .",
