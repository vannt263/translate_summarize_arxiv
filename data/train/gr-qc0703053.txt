    "more than thirty years after the first numerical simulations of binary black hole dynamics , the numerical relativity community is finally ready to compare binary black hole simulations with experimental data .",
    "thanks to a series of recent breakthroughs , long term evolutions of inspiralling binary black holes that last for more than one orbit have been obtained with several independent codes , and accurate gravitational wave signals have been computed @xcite .",
    "the use of numerical waveforms as templates for gravitational wave detection requires large - scale parameter studies , and correspondingly large computational resources .",
    "the main current technical problems in the field are the efficiency of the numerical simulations and the development of a `` data analysis pipeline '' , connecting numerical simulations with analytical calculations of the early inspiral and late ringdown phases , and ( eventually ) with gravitational wave searches in actual detector data . to build a common language between the numerical relativity and data analysis communities",
    "we must develop a deeper understanding of the physical content of the simulations using analytical techniques , such as post - newtonian ( pn ) theory and black hole perturbation theory .",
    "a better analytical understanding of the simulations is important for many reasons :    * to determine which regions of the parameter space ( mass , spin magnitude and inclination , orbital separation , eccentricity ... ) _ must _ be explored by numerical simulations , and which regions can be covered by ( say ) analytically - inspired interpolations of the numerical waveforms .",
    "this would obviously save a significant amount of computing time . * to develop optimal strategies for the construction of detection templates , using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques . * to understand details of the non - linear physics encoded in the strong - field merger gravitational waveforms , and extract as much science as possible from a detection .",
    "in this paper we focus on point ( 3 ) , and we try to develop a general framework to quantitatively compare analytical calculations of the inspiral and ringdown waveforms with the `` full '' waveforms produced by numerical simulations , extending from late inspiral through merger and ringdown .    our work can be considered an extension of the recent analysis by buonanno , cook and pretorius ( @xcite , henceforth bcp ) .",
    "bcp studied simulations of non - spinning , equal mass black hole binaries starting out at three different initial separations . in this work",
    "we examine a larger set of simulations performed using the bam code @xcite and the moving puncture method .",
    "we consider seven different mass ratios ( @xmath8 to @xmath9 in steps of @xmath10 ) with initial coordinate separation @xmath11 , roughly corresponding to @xmath12 orbits before merger .",
    "for each mass ratio , the simulations were carried out at three different resolutions . to explore the effect of initial separation on the physical parameters of the remnant , we also consider two runs at separation @xmath13 ( for @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , and one run at separation @xmath16 ( for @xmath17 ) .",
    "we typically use an extraction radius @xmath18 , with the exception of the @xmath17 run with @xmath16 , in which case we extract gravitational waves at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "section [ setup ] contains details of our numerical setup . in section [ memory ]",
    "we study in some detail a well - known issue with the extraction of gravitational waveforms from numerical simulations : the problem of fixing integration constants when we integrate the weyl scalar @xmath21 twice in time to obtain the gravitational wave amplitude @xmath22 . fixing the integration constants to zero",
    "produces a systematic drift in @xmath22 and in its first time derivative .",
    "this drift is sometimes referred to in the literature as a `` memory effect '' , but this is somewhat misleading .",
    "the so - called `` memory effect '' is really due to numerical errors , wrong initial conditions and limitations of wave extraction techniques , and it should _ not _ be confused with the christodoulou memory , which is a true ( if typically small ) physical effect due to the non - linearity of general relativity @xcite . we find that the extraction radius is critical to reduce the amplitude drift , and that resolution only seems to affect the drift for low - amplitude components of the wave .    in section [ sec : transition ] we study the inspiral - merger transition .",
    "we start by projecting the 2.5pn gravitational wave amplitude for quasi - circular , non - spinning binaries @xcite onto spin - weighted spherical harmonics . in this way",
    "we obtain the spin - weighted spherical harmonic components of the weyl scalar as pn series in the binary s orbital frequency : @xmath23 .",
    "we refer to this analytical expression of the gravitational wave amplitudes as the _ post - newtonian quasi - circular _ ( pnqc ) approximation ( see section [ sec : pnqc ] for details , and appendix [ app : multipoles ] for a complete list of all the multipolar components ) .",
    "the pnqc approximation can be used in two ways .",
    "first , given the orbital frequency evolution @xmath24 , we can compute ( an approximation to ) the multipolar components @xmath25 .",
    "conversely , given the modulus of the wave amplitude @xmath26 , we can numerically invert the pn expansions to obtain a pnqc estimate of the orbital frequency : @xmath27 . in sections [ freq - ests ]",
    "we compare @xmath28 with two alternative estimates of the orbital frequency , first introduced in bcp : @xmath29 ( an estimate obtained from the gravitational wave frequency ) and @xmath30 ( computed from the punctures coordinate motion ) . using these three different estimates of the orbital frequency , we study the convergence of the pnqc approximation .",
    "we find that , as in the point particle case @xcite , the convergence of the pn series is not monotonic .",
    "we also study the effect of resolution and wave extraction on the agreement between pnqc results and numerical results .",
    "we find that low resolution increases numerical noise in the frequencies and amplitudes at late times .",
    "a small extraction radius produces systematic errors at large separations , where gravitational wavelengths are longer , but it does not sensibly affect the ringdown phase .    in section [ energy - j ] we study in detail the total radiated energy @xmath31 and the final angular momentum @xmath32 as functions of the mass ratio , providing fitting formulas for each of these quantities .",
    "we also compare the energy and angular momentum fluxes with their pnqc estimates , and we study ( both analytically and numerically ) the multipolar distribution of the radiation . to leading order , we find that @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the so - called symmetric mass ratio , and we provide fitting formulas for these quantities .",
    "as predicted by the pnqc approximation , odd-@xmath6 multipoles of the radiation are suppressed in the equal mass limit . as the mass ratio increases , higher multipoles ( with @xmath36 ) carry a larger fraction of the total energy : for @xmath37 , @xmath38 typically carries @xmath39 of the total energy ( see table [ tab : summary ] below ) .    in section [ fitmerger ]",
    "we turn our attention to the merger - ringdown transition . during ringdown",
    "the waveform can be described as a superposition of complex exponentials , the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) . in @xcite",
    "we argued that prony methods ( which are well - known in signal processing ) are in many ways `` optimal '' methods to extract qnm frequencies from a numerical signal .",
    "after explaining our choice of the fitting window , in section [ wrjm ] we use prony methods and standard , non - linear least - squares fits to look at the time dependence of the final black hole s parameters .",
    "we find resolution - dependent deviations in these parameters from the values predicted by linear black hole perturbation theory .",
    "these effects may be due to non - linearities and/or to rotational mode coupling , but at present we can not exclude the possibility that they are , more trivially , an artifact of finite numerical resolution . in section [ sec : crosscorrelate ]",
    "we show that , by cross - correlating information from different multipolar components of the ringdown waves , we can find an empirical `` best guess '' for the optimal time to estimate the final black hole s mass and angular momentum .",
    "we argue that , because of the no - hair theorem , this best guess corresponds to the last time when the angular momenta ( or masses ) obtained by fitting the dominant multipoles agree with each other . in support of this argument",
    ", we also show that estimates of the mass and spin of the final black hole based on qnm fits are in remarkable agreement with wave extraction methods .",
    "black hole qnms do not form a complete set , and for this reason it is not possible to define unambiguously the beginning of the ringdown phase .",
    "in section [ sec : rdstart ] we consider three different definitions of the ringdown starting time , two of which have already appeared in the literature ( but not in the context of binary black hole simulations ) .",
    "the first definition is based on looking for the time at which a qnm expansion provides the best fit to the actual numerical waveform , in the sense of a suitably defined norm @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , when applied to our numerical waveforms , this method is not particularly useful .",
    "the reason is that the norm is quite flat ( and even worse , has some oscillations ) over a wide range of starting times around the minimum . a second",
    ", more useful definition looks for the time maximizing the _ energy content _ of the qnm component of the waveform . for this reason , following nollert @xcite , we call it the energy maximized orthogonal projection , or emop .",
    "we find that the `` emop time '' @xmath40 and the maximum fraction of energy carried by ringdown ( @xmath41 ) are remarkably independent of the mass ratio @xmath7 .",
    "this is an indication that the ringdown waveform is in some sense `` universal '' : it does not depend too much on the details of the pre - merger phase .",
    "to our knowledge , the third definition of the ringdown starting time has not been introduced before .",
    "it uses a detection - based criterion , maximizing the `` effective energy '' deposited in a matched filter . in the conclusions we present a list of open problems and directions for future research .    to improve readability ,",
    "some lengthy equations and technical material are presented in the appendices .",
    "appendix [ app : multipoles ] lists the spin - weighted spherical harmonic components of the weyl scalar , up to and including 2.5pn terms in a pn expansion of the waveforms .",
    "appendix [ app : postplunge ] provides fits for the energy , angular momentum and linear momentum radiated after the estimated time of formation of a common apparent horizon ( cah ) .",
    "since the total energy radiated in a simulation depends on the initial separation of the binary , in this appendix we also try to provide estimates for the energy , angular momentum and linear momentum radiated `` after plunge '' .",
    "a problem here is that the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) is a controversial concept for comparable - mass binaries , and there is no unique way to define the beginning of the plunge phase . given these intrinsic ambiguities , we estimate the starting time of the plunge , @xmath42 , as the time when the orbital frequency @xmath43 becomes larger than the isco frequency computed in pn theory ( at 2pn or 3pn order , to bracket uncertainties )",
    ". we also present a comparison of our results with pn estimates of the post - plunge radiation by blanchet _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "computational resources and resolution limitations reduce the accuracy of numerical simulations for large mass ratio . unfortunately , many astrophysical black hole binaries could have @xmath44 or larger ( see eg .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is important to determine the maximum value of @xmath7 that should be simulated in numerical relativity , or equivalently , the smallest value of @xmath7 for which black hole perturbation theory can be considered adequate for detection and/or parameter estimation .",
    "appendix [ app : pointparticles ] collects some results from perturbation theory that may be useful in this context .",
    "we point out that , for large mass ratio , our numerical simulations seem to be in reasonable agreement with perturbative calculations of particles plunging with large angular momentum into a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "finally , in appendix [ app : polarization ] we introduce quantitative measures of the polarization state of the waveform .",
    "we show that the polarization of the wave ( as viewed from the normal to the orbital plane ) is circular for both inspiral and ringdown , with the exception of the unphysical portions of the wave : the initial data burst and the final , noise - dominated part of the ringdown waveform .    in all of this paper we adopt geometrical units ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "unless otherwise indicated , physical quantities are usually normalized to the total arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass of the system @xmath46 .",
    "the adm masses of all configurations presented in this study have been calculated using ansorg s @xcite spectral solver for binary black hole puncture data . due to the spectral accuracy and the compactification of the coordinates , which facilitates evaluation of the adm mass at infinite radius , the uncertainties in this quantity are negligible relative to those arising out of the numerical time evolution .",
    ".[tab : summary ] summary of the main results of this paper ( see text ) . to convert from radiated momenta to kick velocities in km  s@xmath47 ,",
    "the numbers in this table must be multiplied by @xmath48 km  s@xmath47 .",
    "further details ( including estimates of the uncertainties ) are given in the bulk of the paper . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      one of the most prominent features borne out of binary black hole simulations seems to be the absence of strong non - linearities : the potential barrier close to the black hole horizon acts as a very effective cloak , filtering out many non - linear features of the dynamics @xcite . for this reason results from perturbation theory ( i.e. , @xmath49 )",
    "can usually be extrapolated to the equal mass ratio case , yielding very good agreement with full blown numerical simulations . to quote smarr , ``",
    "the agreement is so remarkable that something deep must be at work '' @xcite .",
    "this was also found to be the case for the head - on collision of two black holes .",
    "the perturbation theory result @xmath50 , with @xmath51 @xcite can be compared to the full numerical result for @xmath17 : @xmath52 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "simple scaling arguments applied to perturbative results work surprisingly well .    on this basis , a natural conjecture is that particles plunging with large but sub - critical orbital angular momentum should describe reasonably well the final stages of a binary black hole inspiral @xcite .",
    "indeed , some of the results discussed in the main text suggest that the merger of two equal mass black holes can be described by extrapolating results from perturbation theory .",
    "for instance , the final spin of the black hole can be predicted by using the small mass ratio approximation : see eq .",
    "( [ iscofinalj ] ) and the related discussion .    for inspiralling binaries evolving through quasi - circular orbits ,",
    "the plunge ( `` merger '' ) happens when the smaller body crosses the isco , even though this notion is not well defined for comparable - mass bodies .",
    "we argue that the merger phase should be reasonably well described by a particle plunging with an orbital angular momentum @xmath53 only slightly smaller than the marginal value @xmath54 ( corresponding to a radius equal to @xmath55 ) . in this case",
    "the trajectory resembles that of a particle going through the merger phase : a quasi - circular orbit followed by a plunge .",
    "it is important to specify how close @xmath53 should be to the marginal value .",
    "we look for orbits that complete barely less than one lap before plunging .",
    "this guarantees that the energy output is due only to a plunge trajectory ; it also guarantees that the orbit was quasi - circular before the plunge .",
    "we therefore argue that , as seen from the table , @xmath56 is a near - optimal value .",
    "an obvious objection is that the isco for point particles is not at @xmath57 ( the location of the marginally bound orbit ) , but rather at @xmath58 .",
    "fortunately , for more massive bodies an approximate isco can be defined , and it is usually closer to @xmath57 . we can thus try to extend these perturbative results to understand the merger phase .    extrapolating the point particle results presented in the previous subsections we get , for non - rotating holes : = 0.485,=0.15,v_recoil=232kms^-1 .    for instance , the value @xmath59 for the energy is found extrapolating the last row in table [ tab : energyplungenonrotating ] by the substitution @xmath60 . from fits of the corresponding numerical quantities at the 3pn isco ( which should work as a good reference point , for lack of a better guess )",
    "we get :    = 0.421,=0.19,v_recoil^isco=120kms^-1 ,    the two sets of values are reasonably consistent .",
    "the largest disagreement refers to the linear momentum radiated , and therefore to the recoil velocity of the final hole .",
    "getting information about the polarization content of a waveform is simple in the presence of a monochromatic wave . in more general settings ,",
    "making statements about the polarization state is easier in fourier space .",
    "methods to compute the polarization content of a waveform solely from a time - domain analysis were presented in @xcite . here",
    "we shall adapt these techniques for the case at hand .    from the ( real ) polarization components @xmath61 , in order to avoid problems with the integration constants and to sidestep the memory effect discussed in section [ memory ] .",
    "this should have no influence on the final results .",
    "] we can define the so - called _ analytic signal _",
    "@xmath62 in the following way : h_+ & & h_+(t)+ih_+(t ) , + h _ & & h_(t)+ih_(t).the imaginary part of the analytic signal is the hilbert transform @xmath63 of the signal @xmath64 , defined as ( t)=_-^+ d , where the integral is taken as the cauchy principal value . for reference",
    "we note that the hilbert transform of @xmath65 is @xmath66 and the transform of @xmath67 is @xmath65 .    from the analytic signal",
    "we define a covariance matrix @xmath68 as @xmath69 where an asterisk stands for complex conjugation .",
    "we note that the covariance matrix is hermitian , and thus its eigenvalues @xmath70 are real and positive . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath71 . it can be shown that the normalized eigenvector @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) associated with @xmath74 points in the direction of the largest amount of polarization @xcite .",
    "one can define an elliptical component of polarization @xmath75 as p_e= , where x=_. the quantity @xmath76 for circular polarization , and @xmath77 for linear polarization . for illustration , consider the waveform @xmath78 .",
    "this is a good approximation to a typical inspiral waveform at large orbital separation , as viewed from the normal to the orbital plane , and it is obviously circularly polarized .",
    "for this waveform we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this implies @xmath81 and @xmath76 , as expected . for @xmath82 ( linear polarization ) we would have @xmath83 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus @xmath75 is a good indicator of the degree of circular or linear polarization .",
    "we can also define a polarization strength as follows : p_s=1- .",
    "@xmath84 means that the waveform is entirely linearly polarized or circularly polarized ( there is only one polarization component ) , and @xmath85 means that the two polarization states have comparable magnitude .    in fig .",
    "[ wf1-pol ] we show the result of computing @xmath75 using the dominant ( @xmath86 ) component of a binary black hole merger waveform with @xmath87 .",
