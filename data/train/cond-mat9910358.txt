    "two dimensional confinement of excitons or atoms by magnetic fields is an important phenomenon in physics , and is expected to bring a significant improvement to lasers and other functional devices  @xcite .",
    "numerous works have been carried out on the study of the exciton properties in applied magnetic fields  @xcite . however , for the most part , all the attention has been focused on the influence of homogenous fields on the exciton inner properties .",
    "several theoretical investigations and experiments show the possibility of trapping and guiding of atoms by means of non - homogeneous magnetic fields  @xcite . recently ,",
    "numerous papers  @xcite have appeared on the properties of charged particles , like e. g. electrons , in different non - homogeneous magnetic field profiles .",
    "for example , quantum mechanical bound states were found which had no classical analogue .",
    "@xcite performed photoluminescense ( pl ) measurements on excitons in the presence of non - homogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "strips of ferromagnetic material ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) on top of a quantum well were used to create strong magnetic field gradients .",
    "they concluded that excitons are forced to regions of low field gradient and that magnetic traps for excitons are feasible . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no theoretical work in the literature on studies of excitons in non - homogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop a mathematical formalism for calculating the quantum mechanical properties of excitons in a non - homogeneous magnetic field , and to illustrate the trapping possibilities of the excitons in some magnetic field profiles .",
    "these ones are created by the deposition of magnetic disks and also superconducting disks on top of a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with a homogeneous field applied perpendicular to the 2deg .",
    "it results in a non - homogeneous magnetic dipole type of profile and in a magnetic antidot  @xcite profile , respectively , in the 2deg .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .  ii the effective hamiltonian describing the exciton motion in the non - homogeneous magnetic field is derived . in sec .",
    "iii we consider circular symmetric magnetic field profiles and reduce the exciton hamiltonian to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) schrdinger equation subjected to a spatially dependent effective potential and effective mass . in sec .",
    "iv we calculate explicitly the magnetic field profiles used in our work and study how strongly they are able to trap excitons . our numerical results for the exciton",
    "trapping energies are discussed in sec .",
    "v , and the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we consider a 2d system of two particles with opposite charge interacting via the coulomb interaction and moving in a non - homogeneous magnetic field characterized by the vector potential @xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian of that system is given by :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the dielectric constant of the material the exciton is moving in , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the electron ( hole ) effective mass , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the electron and hole coordinates , respectively , in the @xmath7-plane .",
    "to simplify the above hamiltonian , we use the center of mass @xmath8 and relative motion coordinates @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the total mass of the exciton .",
    "next , in order to obtain the correct asymptotic behavior , we apply a wave function phase transformation analogous to the one used by gorkov and dzyaloshinsky@xcite in the case of a homogeneous magnetic field :",
    "@xmath11    which leads to the following transformed hamiltonian :    @xmath12    in real experimental situations  @xcite the size of the exciton is smaller than the length scale over which the magnetic field varies , which allows us to use the adiabatic approach  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the exciton relative motion is fast as compared with its center - of - mass motion , and that the characteristic dimension in the relative coordinate ( i.e. the exciton radius ) is much smaller than that of the center - of - mass motion ( i.e. the characteristic length of the magnetic field inhomogeneity ) .",
    "this allows us to expand the vector potential @xmath13 into @xmath14 power series restricting the consideration with up to second order terms .",
    "note that the exciton radius in gaas , e.g. , is typically @xmath15 , while the magnetic field inhomogeneity varies typically on a micron scale@xcite . within the adiabatic approximation",
    ", we obtain the following expression for the exciton hamiltonian :    @xmath16 \\big)^2 - \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon r } , \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the exciton reduced mass and @xmath18 .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian,(eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] ) , describes the kinetic energy of the exciton relative motion , in which the expression @xmath19 can be interpreted as an effective vector potential describing the local magnetic field @xmath20 .",
    "we can choose the gauge such that @xmath21 , and simplify the second term of this expression by applying the following transformation :    @xmath22    with @xmath23 .",
    "the above transformation does not change the center - of - mass motion , and leads only to the appearance of @xmath24-order terms in the relative motion , which are neglected in the present adiabatic approach . in doing so",
    ", we obtain the following transformed hamiltonian : @xmath25 where terms of first and second power in the magnetic field strength are denoted by @xmath26 here the symbol @xmath27 stands for the exciton relative angular momentum operator .",
    "notice that in case of a homogeneous magnetic field the above hamiltonian reduces to the one which can be found in the literature ( see ref .",
    "5 and references therein ) .",
    "the exciton hamiltonian in a homogeneous magnetic field consists of a part with no magnetic field dependence , a part linear ( the angular momentum term ) in the magnetic field , and a quadratic part ( the diamagnetic shift term ) in the magnetic field . in the present hamiltonian which describes the exciton motion in a non - homogeneous magnetic field we also have these terms , but now they are position dependent .",
    "we also have an additional term with a linear dependence in the magnetic field ( the last term in the @xmath28 hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ w1w2 ] ) ) which results from the gradient in the magnetic field , and which modifies the exciton mass .",
    "now within the spirit of the above adiabatic approach , the total exciton wave function is represented as the product of the wave functions describing its relative and center - of - mass motions , i.  e. , @xmath29 .",
    "next , it is supposed that the relative motion wave function @xmath30 obeys the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath31 which includes all terms of total hamiltonian , eq .",

    ". it does not complicates , however , the effective hamiltonian derivation , but one should take into account that now the eigenvalue of the relative motion equation , which usually plays a role of the effective potential for the center - of - mass equation , is an operator and gives the correction to the kinetic center - of - mass operator as well .",

    "please note that the 2d exciton ground state energy @xmath78 is @xmath79 mev and the 2d exciton size is one half the bohr radius , @xmath80 . from the above equations , we notice that the non - homogeneous magnetic field modifies the exciton center - of - mass motion in the following ways .",
    "first the exciton feels a @xmath81 effective potential .",
    "it implies that excitons will be collected in a region where the magnetic field strength is minimum .",
    "next , the exciton mass is enhanced , it increases with @xmath81 , which favours the localization of excitons .",
    "third , the kinetic term gives a contribution proportional to the gradient in the @xmath82-field , i.e. , a @xmath83 term .",
    "finally , we see that the non - homogeneous magnetic field also interacts with the exciton angular momentum , and that this interaction is controled by the difference in mass @xmath84 .",
    "the reason is that the exciton is a neutral particle , and if the electron and hole would have the same mass , the angular momentum term would not contribute because , electron and hole give the same contribution but with opposite sign .",
    "we solve eq .",

    "such an experimental configuration results in a non - homogeneous magnetic field profile in the 2deg .",
    "the first profile ( a ) results into a magnetic dipole type of profile , and the second ( b ) is also called the magnetic antidot  @xcite .",
    "a sketch of the two experimental systems , the magnetized disk and the superconducting disk , are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "3(a ) , respectively .      to calculate the magnetic field created by a magnetized disk , we assume that the disk is very thin and is completely magnetized in the z - direction .",
    "therefore , we can write the magnetization in the following way :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the disk thickness , @xmath88 is the disk radius , @xmath89 the distance of the magnetic disk to the 2deg , @xmath90 the magnetisation , @xmath91 is the heaviside step function , and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the corresponding vector potential can be calculated from the differential form of ampres law @xmath94  @xcite . in cylindrical coordinates ,",

    "the reason for this is as follows : the coefficient of the diamagnetic term in the effective potential equation ( the term with quadratic dependence in the magnetic field in eq .",

    "the magnetic disk in the presence of a negative applied field ( fig .",

    "the analysis of the latter will be left for future research .",
