    "the discovery of ultra - high energy cosmic neutrinos  @xcite opens a unique window to test neutrino properties at very high energies  @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the lepton flavor composition of the neutrino flux is essential for understanding mechanisms of generation , propagation and interactions of the neutrinos .",
    "there are many running experiments such as anita  @xcite , ara  @xcite , antares  @xcite and icecube  @xcite , as well as the next generation deep water neutrino telescopes km3net",
    "@xcite and nt1000  @xcite ( lake baikal ) which will provide results for cosmic neutrinos . of primary interest is the flavor content of the cosmic flux , because even though the initial mechanisms produce mostly muon and electron neutrinos , oscillations over cosmological distances generate a substantial @xmath0 component .",
    "the detection of @xmath0 s in the telescopes has attracted special interest  @xcite and the various event topologies have been classified .",
    "an analysis of the icecube data using the double pulse algorithm did not establish any @xmath0 component at energies 214  tev to 72  pev  @xcite . a second possibility to identify tau neutrinos uses the decay mode @xmath9 and separates the events into showers and tracks  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the observable quantities are @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the icecube collaboration classified their data into showers and tracks and uses a likelihood function in order to obtain the best fit of the events as a function of the sum @xmath12",
    "they combined the results with the astronomical flux and deduced its flavor content with a large uncertainty .",
    "a more detailed analysis is possible when the energies of the muons , @xmath10 , and of the hadronic showers , @xmath11 , are measured separately in the same event .",
    "the distributions in the two variables are sensitive to the @xmath0 component .",
    "the purpose of this article is to provide explicit distributions in ratios of two variables and point out quantities which are less dependent on the shape of the incident fluxes and on the quark distribution functions .",
    "reactions and differ because the values for the energy @xmath10 are lower for reaction and the two reactions have different angular distributions .",
    "our results are computed analytically and it is possible to adopt them to the experimental situations .",
    "we wish to distinguish the two cc reactions :    @xmath13    @xmath14 &   \\\\                                  & & \\hskip1.cm\\mu+\\nu_{\\tau}+\\bar\\nu_{\\mu},}\\label{eq : rectau}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 denotes the hadronic final state . the hadrons will initiate showers in the detector and the muons will produce single tracks , as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in both cases",
    "the energy distributions in the hadronic showers are the same , but the @xmath10 distributions differ because of the intervening @xmath16-decay .",
    "the leptonic @xmath16-decay produces two invisible neutrinos .",
    "it remains to quantify how much lower is the muon energy in the second reaction .",
    "for this purpose we study distributions in the two dimensionless variables    @xmath17    with @xmath18 denoting @xmath19 or @xmath16 leptons and the visible inelasticity ,    @xmath20    in this investigation the neutrino energies are very high ; they range above 100  gev to many 10.0 tev , where the momentum transfer squared , @xmath21 , is small relative to @xmath22 and we use the four - point interaction . in addition at this energy range",
    "the cc cross section behaves as @xmath23 which follows from bjorken scaling . in the following we use the parton model cross sections where both @xmath24 and @xmath25 processes are calculated with the same quark distribution functions .",
    "we shall show later that many results are independent of the quark distribution functions and also independent of the neutrino / antineutrino fluxes .    in the above approach the differential cross section for muon neutrinos is    @xmath26 , \\label{eq : sigmup5}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 are the integrals over quark or antiquark distribution functions .",
    "reaction   is a two step process .",
    "first the @xmath16-lepton is produced and then it decays .",
    "the cross section differential on the muon energy is a convolution over the energies of the intermediate @xmath16-lepton @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the cross section for reaction   differential to the @xmath16-lepton energy , @xmath30 is the total decay width of the tau , @xmath31 is the differential decay width of the tau with respect to the muon energy in the reference frame where @xmath16 moves with energy  @xmath32 .",
    "this two step process is analogous to the parton model calculations  @xcite .",
    "the initial @xmath0nucleon interaction is the source of a beam of @xmath16-leptons with a known `` lepton distribution function '' .",
    "it is followed by the known fragmentation of the @xmath16 s into muons .",
    "the result of a straightforward calculation is    @xmath33\\ln ( 1+r_\\mu ) \\right\\}\\label{eq : distrmm},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where br is the branching ratio for the decay @xmath34 .",
    "equations   and   are for neutrino - induced reactions ; for antineutrinos we interchange the quark and antiquarks distribution functions @xmath35 .",
    "we also notice that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are independent variables with the neutrino energy appearing as an overall factor .",
    "thus when we multiply the cross sections with the flux factors the integrals over neutrino fluxes factorize .",
    "let @xmath38 be the flux factor of flavor @xmath18 measured in units @xmath39 .",
    "the fluxes of the extraterrestrial neutrinos and antineutrinos are expected to be same :    @xmath40    they may be different for various flavors and we present later figures for various compositions",
    ". then the yield averaged over the fluxes is    @xmath41de_{\\nu},\\label{eq : events3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 is the time of exposure , @xmath43 is the solid angle of coverage , @xmath44 is the effective number of nucleons in the target , @xmath45 and @xmath46 define the range of neutrino energies investigated .    for illustration",
    "we consider the case where the @xmath8 and @xmath0 fluxes are equal .",
    "we sum over neutrino and antineutrino interactions and normalize to the total number of events .",
    "note that a molecule of ice and/or water neutrino detectors consists of 10 protons and 8 neutrons being close to isoscalar , and we do not treat the protons and neutrons separately  @xcite .",
    "the final result reads    @xmath47.\\label{eq : events34}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is remarkable that the @xmath36-distribution   depends neither on the incoming ( anti)neutrino energy nor on the quark distribution functions .",
    "the formalism presented above can be easily adopted to cases where the flavor compositions of the neutrino flux are different .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath36-distributions for the @xmath48 and @xmath49 compositions . for the curves and the rest of the article we use @xmath50  @xcite .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the @xmath36-distribution is not dramatically affected by the presence of equal fraction of tau ( anti)neutrinos in the flux . there is only @xmath51 change at relatively large values of @xmath36 . at the same time , in this region the relative number of expected neutrino events drops down by orders of magnitude and it would be difficult to resolve experimentally the difference in the @xmath36-distributions .",
    "a reason for such a behavior is that the energy spectrum of muons coming from taus decaying in flight has no longer the distinct peak at @xmath52 as in the tau rest frame , but becomes a relatively smooth function of @xmath10 without peculiarities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the tau neutrinos may more clearly manifest themselves if we concentrate all events in an interval which does not stretch as @xmath36 from zero to infinity but is much smaller .",
    "this may be achieved , for example , by using the visible inelasticity @xmath5 which varies from zero to unity .",
    "proceeding in the same way as we described above , one can calculate the @xmath5-distribution for the case @xmath49 by adding the events originating from @xmath53 and @xmath54 interactions and obtain    @xmath55.\\label{eq : events34f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for other flavor compositions of the neutrino flux we can also calculate the visible inelasticity distribution .",
    "we computed the cases @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath56 shown in fig .",
    "one can see that in the case of equal fluxes of muon and tau neutrinos there is a dramatic increase in the number of events as @xmath7 .",
    "we also present the situation of a purely @xmath57 flux which is an idealized model of the so - called upward - going neutrinos .",
    "this occurs when the neutrinos travel through the earth and the @xmath58 and @xmath53-components are absorbed thus only tau neutrinos survive at the detector .",
    "details of the calculations are given in reference  @xcite .",
    "the fact that many models predict a substantial component of tau neutrinos in the extraterrestrial neutrino flux raises the challenge of obtaining direct or indirect evidence for their presence .    the large volume neutrino telescopes may have the capability to provide such evidence , but this will require considerable experimental effort .",
    "the challenge is to determine which distributions , accessible to experiments , are sensitive to this effect .",
    "the analysis of this work concerns only those neutrino events which contain simultaneously a hadronic shower and a muon illustrated in fig .",
    "we computed the corresponding event distributions for reactions   and   as functions of the dimensionless variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we adopted the quark - parton model and the four - fermion interaction ( no @xmath59-propagator ) working well for @xmath60 tev .",
    "however we expect our results not to change significantly at higher neutrino energies , since we consider ratios of the cross sections in which case the @xmath59-propagator corrections cancel out to an extent .",
    "we emphasize an advantage of the approximations adopted in this article that the quark distribution functions factorize and drop out in ratios as well .",
    "the same is true for the neutrino flux which makes possible to collect events at lower energies .",
    "we find that more @xmath0-induced events populate the region @xmath61 as shown in fig .",
    "for example , the presence of equal fraction of tau and muon neutrinos in the flux produces events with muons which have a minimum at @xmath6 and an excess of events as @xmath7 ; in contrast the muon neutrino induced events are decreasing monotonically as @xmath7 . for the @xmath49 flavor composition ,",
    "the ratio of the number of events above @xmath62 to that below is 0.55 , while for muon neutrinos only this ratio equals to 0.46 . thus there is a difference between the ratios of the order of @xmath63 .",
    "it will therefore be necessary and efficient to rely on the difference in the shapes of the two curves .",
    "in other words , this @xmath0-component should lead to an increase of the number of slow or stopping muons in the detector in comparison to the case of a purely @xmath8-flux . to make a significant distinction between these curves we estimated that  @xmath64 neutrino events with final muons are needed . assuming the best fit for the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux  @xcite , this number of events will be collected in a few years in the icecube and other large volume neutrino telescopes . in addition the region @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) must be excluded from the analysis because the background from cc interactions of @xmath58 s and @xmath0 s and nc interactions is very large .",
    "nevertheless , one can approach this point as close as it is allowed by the detector muon energy threshold .",
    "likewise , the case @xmath67 with no visible cascade can be imitated by atmospheric muons penetrating into the detector . the contribution from the atmospheric muons and neutrinos",
    "can be rejected by defining an outer veto volume in the detector and by observing extensive air showers on coincidence with neutrino events .",
    "a full detector simulation including these backgrounds with monte carlo generators can describe in detail the behavior of the proposed distributions for each experiment .",
