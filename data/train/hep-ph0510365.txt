    "the most exciting new results presented at hadron05 ( excepting the withdrawal of the pentaquark ) were the new experimental developments in charmonium spectroscopy .",
    "after a hiatus of approximately 20 years , there have been many exciting new results in the charmonium sector , due largely to the rather surprising effectiveness of b decays in producing @xmath2 resonances @xcite .",
    "this was discussed here by trabelsi @xcite , who noted that the ckm - favored b meson weak decay process leads to a relatively large ( _ ca . _",
    "1% ) inclusive @xmath3 branching fraction , due to the favorable @xmath4 and @xmath5 ckm matrix elements in the quark - level process @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath3 mesons identified in b decays to date include not only the s - wave j@xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , but also the p - wave states @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the dominantly d - wave @xmath13 .",
    "this is a surprising result , since the w propagator in the diagram might _ a priori _ have been expected to couple preferentially to a final @xmath3 system at small separations of @xmath14 .",
    "production of p - wave and dominantly d - wave @xmath3 states with branching fractions comparable to those of s - wave states has nonetheless been reported experimentally .",
    "this gives us an effective method for producing higher - mass radially- and orbitally - excited @xmath3 states , and perhaps other states in this flavor sector , such as @xmath3 hybrids or charm molecules .",
    "four new states which might be charmonia were discussed at this meeting in plenary presentations ; these are the z(3931 ) , y(3943 ) , x(3943 ) and y(4260 ) .",
    "( the earlier discovery of the x(3872 ) has apparently led to a preference for the far end of the latin alphabet in naming these new states . )",
    "we will discuss the new states individually , and review the possibilities discussed for assignments in the conventional @xmath3 spectrum .",
    "the new states z(3931 ) , y(3943 ) and x(3943 ) reported by belle all have possible assignments as conventional 2p @xmath3 states ; to misquote hamlet , `` 2p or not 2p , that is the question '' . the z(3931 ) , discussed here by trabelsi @xcite was reported in @xmath15 ( both charge states @xcite ; see figure  1 ) .",
    "it has a reported mass and width of    @xmath16    @xmath17    belle suggests a 2p @xmath18 assignment for the z(3931 ) .",
    "this remarkable state has a surprisingly small total width of about 20 mev , which is about 1/2 of what is expected for a 2p @xmath18 @xmath3 meson at this mass @xcite .",
    "the reported two - photon width is @xmath19 which is about 1/2 the theoretical expectation for a @xmath18 @xmath3 state @xcite ( neither the total width nor the two - photon width is a disaster , given the typical accuracy of these calculations ) .",
    "another possibility is that the z(3931 ) might be a 2p @xmath20 @xmath3 scalar ; decay calculations using the @xmath21p@xmath22 model show that this state should be surprisingly narrow , due to a node in the dd decay mode which is accidentally near 3.95 gev .",
    "one can differentiate between these options by searching for dd and dd@xmath23 modes ; the scalar @xmath20 will only produce dd , whereas the tensor should decay to both dd and dd@xmath23 , with an expected branching fraction ratio of dd@xmath23/dd @xmath24 .    z@xmath25dd by belle @xcite . ]",
    "the y(3943 ) was reported in b decays to ky , y@xmath26 @xcite , with a mass and width of @xmath27 @xmath28    the combined y(3943 ) formation and decay branching fraction found by belle is @xmath29 since a typical total branching fraction for production of conventional charmonium states in b decays is @xmath30 to @xmath31 , this suggests that the y(3943 ) has a large branching fraction to the closed charm channel @xmath32 , if this enhancement is indeed due to a real resonance .",
    "the remarkable closed - charm @xmath32 mode led belle to suggest that the y(3943 ) might be a charmonium hybrid @xcite .",
    "they note however that the mass of the y(3943 ) is 500 mev below lgt estimates ; this makes the hybrid assignment appear implausible . in view of the mass of the y(3943 ) , another possibility which should be considered is that this is another conventional 2p @xmath3 state ; this would lead to a total width comparable to what is reported for the y(3943 ) , with dd@xmath23 as the dominant decay model .",
    "a search for this dd * mode is underway @xcite , and if found , this may lead to identification of this rather wide enhancement with the 2p @xmath33 @xmath3 state .",
    "ky , y@xmath26 ( fitted in right panel ) @xcite . ]      the x(3943 ) was reported by belle in the double charmonium reaction @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is mainly dd@xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "the fitted parameters are @xmath36 @xmath37    the x(3943 ) has an estimated total width of only about 15 mev , however the missing mass bump in the 3940 region may have a more complicated structure ( see figure  3 ) ; this small width estimate evidently carries considerable uncertainty .    . the @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 are also evident @xcite . ]",
    "belle report that dd@xmath23 is the dominant x(3943 ) decay mode , with a branching fraction of @xmath38 the other available open - charm mode is dd , which is only known as an upper limit , @xmath39 similarly the closed - charm mode @xmath40 ( of interest since this mode is apparently preferred by the y(3943 ) ) is also known as an upper limit , @xmath41 eichten has suggested a 3@xmath42s@xmath22 @xmath8 @xmath3 radial excitation assignment for this state ; given the 3@xmath43s@xmath44 @xmath45 , the mass is roughly correct , and the observation of the @xmath8 and @xmath10 with comparable strength in double charmonium production supports this identification . the other possibility with a dominant dd@xmath23 mode in this mass region is the 2@xmath43p@xmath44 @xmath3 , but the absence of a strong signal for the 1@xmath43p@xmath44 @xmath46 in double charmonium production argues against this 2p assignment .",
    "the 3@xmath42s@xmath22 @xmath8 assignment could be tested by searching for evidence of this state in @xmath47dd@xmath23 .",
    "the most remarkable new state discussed at hadron05 was the y(4260 ) , which was reported by babar in initial state radiation ( isr ) in the reaction @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "there may also be evidence for an enhancement in @xmath49 states near 4.26  gev in the decay b@xmath50k@xmath49 ( in both neutral and negative b / k charge states ) @xcite .",
    "the mass and width reported for the y(4260 ) @xcite are @xmath51 @xmath52     @xcite . ]",
    "the isr production mechanism tells us that this state must be @xmath53 , but it can not be a conventional @xmath3 state because the @xmath53 states in this mass region are well established from earlier @xmath54 annihilation experiments .",
    "( the y(4260 ) is bracketed by the 2@xmath43d@xmath44 @xmath55 and the 4@xmath43s@xmath44 @xmath56 , which have masses that are in excellent agreement with the expectations of @xmath3 potential models . )",
    "the y(4260 ) ( if a real resonance ) evidently represents `` overpopulation '' of the expected quark potential model spectrum of @xmath53 @xmath3 states .",
    "this observation , combined with the fact that there is no enhancement visible in r near this mass @xcite has led to suggestions that this state may be a charmonium hybrid @xcite .",
    "the lightest hybrid multiplet in both the flux tube and bag models contains a @xmath53 state . in the flux tube model",
    "this lightest @xmath3-hybrid multiplet is predicted to lie near 4.2  gev @xcite , and in lgt studies the lightest @xmath57 exotic hybrid ( expected to be near the @xmath53 hybrid in mass ) is found at a rather similar mass of about 4.4  gev @xcite . in these models hybrids have a vanishing @xmath3 wavefunction at contact , so it has long been speculated that they would have small @xmath54 widths , and thus make rather weak contributions to r. a lgt study by the ukqcd group @xcite of the strong decay couplings of exotic @xmath58 hybrids found strikingly large couplings to closed flavor modes ( specifically to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a light scalar isoscalar meson that would decay to @xmath61 ) .",
    "this is sufficiently similar to the babar observation of the y(4260 ) in the single closed - charm mode @xmath49 to be cited as additional possible evidence for a hybrid interpretation .    the unusual @xmath49 mode and the ukqcd study suggest searches of any other accessible closed - charm modes with @xmath53 quantum numbers , such as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and so forth .",
    "ideally the light system should have quantum numbers thought to couple strongly to pure glue , such as @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    in specific decay models ( flux tube and constituent glue )",
    ", theorists have anticipated that the dominant open - charm decay modes of charmonium hybrids would be a meson pair with one internal s - wave ( d , d@xmath23 , d@xmath67 , d@xmath68 ) and one internal p - wave ( such as d@xmath69 and d@xmath70 ) . in the case of the y(4260 ) this suggests dominance of the decay mode dd@xmath44(2430 ) .",
    "this broad d@xmath44 has a width of _ ca . _  400  mev , and decays to d@xmath71 , so this suggests a search for evidence of the y(4260 ) in dd@xmath71",
    "since this is a prediction of a decay model in an untested regime ( hybrids ) , one should be cautious and search the more familiar two - body modes dd , dd@xmath23 , d@xmath23d@xmath23 , d@xmath67d@xmath67 , d@xmath67d@xmath68 and d@xmath68d@xmath68 for evidence of the y(4260 ) as well",
    ". if there is evidence of a large dd@xmath44(2430 ) signal , the y(4260 ) would then be quite convincing as a hybrid having properties predicted by the flux tube model .",
    "if it appears in some of these open charm modes such as dd@xmath23 and d@xmath67d@xmath68 at rates comparable to or larger than @xmath72 , one might claim a hybrid but speculate that the flux tube decay model was inaccurate in predicting hybrid decay modes .",
    "finally , if the y(4260 ) does not appear in any other mode , one might be skeptical about whether the @xmath72 signal is due to a resonance at all ; there are nonresonant possibilities , such as production of dd@xmath44 in @xmath73 dd@xmath44 followed by an inelastic fsi that produces a broad @xmath72 enhancement due to the ( very broadened ) onset of dd@xmath44(2430 ) threshold events ( which would appear near 4.3  gev ) .    in any case",
    "the evidence for the y(4260 ) from babar is not strong , with an estimated @xmath74 events @xcite .",
    "since it is clear from the reported mass that the y(4260 ) is not a conventional @xmath3 state , it will be very important to test the existence of this state through the accumulation of better statistics .",
    "progress in other sectors of @xmath0 has been less dramatic , although there have been some interesting developments .",
    "the unusual and very narrow x(3872 ) was reviewed here by trabelsi @xcite and by swanson @xcite .",
    "there is now clear evidence that this state is @xmath75 , which was a prediction of the dd@xmath23 molecule picture promoted in particular by tornqvist @xcite and swanson @xcite .",
    "new results from cdf  ii discussed here by maciel @xcite show that the @xmath76 mass distribution in the decay mode x(3872)@xmath77 is well described by the assumption that it is due to @xmath78 .",
    "one especially striking prediction of the ( neutral d ) d@xmath79d@xmath80 molecule model is that one should observe comparable strength @xmath81 and @xmath78 decay modes @xcite , due to the maximal isospin breaking present in the initial state .",
    "this prediction appears to have been confirmed by the evidence from belle for the @xmath82 in the @xmath83 mode x(3872)@xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath83 invariant mass peaks at the highest mass , as expected for a virtual @xmath82 , and the ratio of @xmath85 to @xmath83 branching fractions is close to unity , @xmath86 as expected in the dd@xmath23 model .",
    "there is also evidence from belle for the radiative transition x(3872)@xmath87 @xcite , with the width ratio @xmath88 which should be useful in testing the details of different models of the x(3872 ) .",
    "most of the studies of heavy - light mesons reported at hadron05 considered decays of known @xmath1 states , and these have provided very extensive new results on light meson spectroscopy ( see for example the talk by asner @xcite ) .",
    "there has been rather less recent activity on the spectroscopy of heavy - light mesons themselves .",
    "several new results on @xmath1 spectroscopy were presented at hadron05 , and i will specialize to a few of these in the b and d sectors .",
    "there are also some new results on heavy - quark baryons , such as the identification by selex of the first doubly - charmed baryon , a @xmath89 at @xmath90  mev ; baryon spectroscopy was discussed here by cumulat @xcite and in the summary by klempt @xcite .",
    "maciel @xcite discussed results from cdf on the b@xmath91 pseudoscalar meson , which is reported in decays to @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the fitted mass determined from the _ ca .",
    "_  19  events was @xmath93 which is roughly consistent with or somewhat below theoretical expectations .",
    "reported by cdf in @xmath94 @xcite . ]",
    "results from cdf and d0 on orbitally excited b mesons were also presented ; for the first time we have evidence for the separate states in the p - wave b meson multiplet , rather than seeing an unresolved superposition of states .",
    "both experiments identify b mesons in @xmath95k events , which are combined with another @xmath96 and studied for evidence of excited b mesons . in both experiments",
    "the results are preliminary , but do show evidence of separate b@xmath97 and b@xmath44 contributions .",
    "the d0 mass results are @xmath98 @xmath99 their b@xmath96 mass plot is shown in figure  6 .",
    "the total widths , constrained in the fit to be equal ( and predicted to be comparable theoretically ) are @xmath100 which is consistent with theoretical expectations for the two narrow p - wave b mesons .",
    "the experimental resolution is estimated to be about 10  mev .",
    "b@xmath96 , b@xmath101b@xmath96 and b@xmath101b@xmath71 are shown @xcite . ]    at the previous meeting hadron03 , the spectroscopy of the d@xmath67 sector was a topic of great interest , due to the discovery of the surprisingly light and narrow states d@xmath102 and d@xmath103 .",
    "here we have heard relatively few new experimental results on these states .",
    "the most interesting new result may be their observation in b decays by belle , reported here by bianco @xcite .",
    "the d@xmath102 is seen in the process b@xmath104 ,",
    "d@xmath105 , and the d@xmath106 may have been seen ( at a much lower rate ) in a similar chain to @xmath107 .",
    "the reported branching fractions are @xmath108 @xmath109 the latter branching fraction produce is also quoted as @xmath110    although it is very interesting to see the narrow d@xmath70 mesons in b decays , uncertainty regarding the production mechanism makes the interpretation of these numbers in terms of the internal structure of the d@xmath70 states somewhat problematic .",
    "there were just four plenary talks at hadron05 by theorists specifically devoted to theory .",
    "since these contributions appear in the proceedings , here i will simply cite the topics discussed , and will consider one of these talks , which addresses a long - standing problem in hadron physics , in more detail .",
    "the theory plenary talks were given by brambilla ( effective field theories ) , brodsky ( anti desitter space and conformal field theory ) , fodor ( recent developments in lattice qcd ) , and van  beveren ( `` complex meson spectroscopy '' ) .",
    "brambilla @xcite discussed recent work on the derivation of effective lagrangians for heavy - quark mesons ( treated as fields ) and gluons .",
    "this approach was cited as having many potential applications in the description of the physics of heavy quark hadrons , including meson and baryon spectroscopy , radiative widths , determination of @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and ( in the pure glue sector ) the spectrum of glueballs .",
    "brodsky @xcite gave a remarkable talk on connections between string theory , maldecena duality , anti desitter space , conformal field theory and hadrons .",
    "these connections suggested a generalization of the mit bag model , which leads to light cone wavefunctions that allowed the evaluation of many properties of hadrons in the hard scattering regime .",
    "predictions of this `` template for qcd '' included results for the spectrum of mesons , baryons and @xmath114 glueballs , and the absence of @xmath115 c - negative `` odderon '' glueballs ( in a classical approximation to this approach ) .",
    "fodor @xcite reviewed aspects of lattice qcd , and concentrated on recent developments in the simulation of qcd at nonzero temperature .",
    "impressive new results have been reported for properties of the qcd phase diagram and equation of state , as a result of developments in algorithms for treating systems at nonzero chemical potential .",
    "these results have potential applications to an unusually broad set of topics , including for example heavy ion collisions at rhic and the internal structure of neutron stars .",
    "finally , van  beveren @xcite discussed the effect of coupling the discrete , stable hadron basis states of the naive quark model to the two - hadron continuum .",
    "this program , often referred to as `` unquenching the quark model '' , is an extremely important topic in hadron physics .",
    "it is clear that coupling naive quark model states ( or quenched lattice qcd states ) to the continuum of real and virtual decay channels will induce many important effects , such as mass shifts , nonzero decay widths , and modified electromagnetic couplings due to continuum components in the state vector .",
    "the narrow d@xmath70 mesons may be examples of the importance of the coupling of quark model states to the continuum .",
    "these states lie _ ca . _  100  mev below the expectations of the naive quark model , which does not include loop effects . the fact that these states are near dk and d@xmath23k thresholds and have very large s - wave couplings to these channels suggests that their anomalously low masses may be due to mass shifts that result from virtual meson loops @xcite .",
    "the effects of virtual hadron loops on hadron properties have been studied in detail only in a few specific cases , usually with a severely truncated set of continuum channels .",
    "evaluation of these loop effects is complicated by the fact that the general three - hadron decay vertex is not well established , and several different models of this coupling have been proposed .",
    "two specific forms that have seen wide application are the @xmath43p@xmath22 model of micu @xcite ( which was used here by van  beveren , and by most studies of loop effects ) and a linear vector potential pair - production model , which was used by the cornell group in their study of the effect of hadron loops on charmonium states @xcite .",
    "application of the @xmath43p@xmath22 decay model to loop effects in @xmath3 suggests that the mass shifts are typically 100s of mev @xcite , much larger than the _ ca . _  10  mev quoted for the cornell decay model @xcite . distinguishing between these apparently very different predictions",
    "is complicated by the fact that the @xmath43p@xmath22 model predicts large _ overall _ mass shifts , but much smaller observable _ differences _ in mass shifts between states .",
    "these @xmath43p@xmath22 and cornell decay models give quite different predictions for some observables , such as the famous d / s ratio in @xmath116 .",
    "comparison of the different predictions with experimentally well established decay amplitudes should allow the development of a realistic working model of the crucial three - hadron vertices in future .",
    "the predicted mass shifts and other loop effects will clearly depend strongly on the model used to describe this coupling .    in their contribution to hadron05 , van  beveren _",
    "_ describe a t - matrix formalism for iterating the effect of these meson loops , and apply it to the calculation of @xmath117 scattering amplitudes .",
    "their results appear to be successful in describing many puzzling aspects of meson spectroscopy , such as the low - mass `` @xmath118 '' and `` @xmath119 '' scalar enhancements and the masses of the narrow d@xmath70 states @xcite .",
    "this type of model shows considerable promise in attempts to understand the importance of hadron loops in the physics of hadrons , and in answering such long - standing questions as why the valence quark model works as well as it does , and under what circumstances it should fail .",
    "in elton smith s presentation @xcite we learned that jefferson lab has now accumulated considerable data on photoproduction of the kaon nucleon system ( from both proton and deuteron targets ) , so that they now have much better statistics than in the data originally cited as evidence for a narrow pentaquark @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for any such state in this new high - statistics data @xcite .",
    "one may compare the nk@xmath120 mass distribution originally reported by the clas collaboration in the reaction @xmath121 in fig.4 of ref.@xcite ( our figure  7 ) to the new , high - statistics proton data shown here by smith ( our figure  8) .",
    "the previously claimed @xmath122 peak at @xmath123  gev has disappeared .",
    "thus , `` the pentaquark is dead ! ''        since we have heard many experimental reports of observations of this or other related pentaquark states over the previous two years , and many theorists have claimed to understand this now vanished signal , it will certainly be of interest to revisit the pentaquark saga in future and ask just what mistakes were made , and what lessons we have learned as a result . here",
    "i will discuss one important issue in the theory of multiquark systems generally ; experimental problems with the pentaquark in particular were reviewed recently by dzierba _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "it is both interesting and unsettling that we have traveled this dead - end multiquark road many times before .",
    "the repeated claims of narrow multiquark resonances in low - statistics data sets accompanied by spurious theoretical support was such a problem in the 1970s that isgur in 1985 wrote of `` the multiquark fiasco '' in a series of schladming lectures @xcite .",
    "the discussion of multiquarks in this reference should be required reading for anyone working on the pentaquark , or on any multiquark resonance .",
    "the conceptual problem with multiquarks was primarily one of understanding strong decays .",
    "most models of multiquark systems simply excluded open decay channels from consideration , and assumed that the entire multiquark system was confined into a single hadron .",
    "since there are many degrees of freedom present , this type of model predicts a very rich spectrum of discrete levels , many of which have exotic quantum numbers .",
    "one famous example is the i=2 @xmath124 @xmath65 flavor - exotic scalar , which was predicted by the mit bag model to have a mass of about 1.2  gev",
    ". a resonant state with these quantum numbers should be clearly visible in the i=2 @xmath61 s - wave phase shift , but experimentally there is no indication of any such resonance ; one sees only repulsive scattering . although the bag model predicts a flavor - exotic multiquark scalar meson at 1.2  gev , none is observed .",
    "what has gone wrong ?",
    "the crucial mistake appears to have been the neglect of strong decay couplings , specifically the assumption by most models of a fully confined multiquark system . in a ( perhaps oversimplified )",
    "quark model picture one can see that the decays of multiquark states are fundamentally different from those of conventional @xmath125 or @xmath126 hadrons , which are the minimal color singlets .",
    "decay of a @xmath125 resonance into two @xmath125 mesons ( for example ) requires a decay interaction , specifically @xmath125 pair production .",
    "in contrast , a multiquark system such as a @xmath127 meson or a @xmath128 pentaquark can simply spontaneously dissociate `` fall apart '' into two separate minimal color singlets , without a decay interaction .",
    "these two very different decay processes are shown in figure  9 .",
    "although the hadron community has absorbed this difference as the `` folklore '' that multiquark states are expected to be very broad , the difference in decays can be much more drastic ; unless there is some form of fission barrier , a multiquark system above its strong fall - apart decay threshold will not exist as a resonance at all .",
    "this was appreciated in the late 1970s , and is the reason for jaffe s statements @xcite regarding his table of bag model dibaryon ( @xmath129 ) multiquarks : `` most of the `` states '' listed in the table probably do not correspond to particles or resonances . ''",
    "the problem is that `` the object is classically unstable against small deformations leading to fission into separate n and p bags .",
    "[ ... ] quantizing about the six - quark object would lead to instabilities analogous to those in a field theory with negative squared mass . '' in other words , these are not metastable states ; the fall - apart effect implies that they do not exist as resonances .    since the proposed pentaquark was above the mass of a kaon and a nucleon",
    ", it too has a fall - apart mode , and should not exist as a resonance barring exceptional circumstances such as a fission barrier .",
    "alas this lesson appears to have been forgotten , and multiquark models that did not consider fall - apart into the kn continuum were accepted as justification for the existence of such states with undue credulity .",
    "0.5 cm santayana s familiar quote unfortunately appears relevant to the pentaquark saga : `` those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . ''",
    "a less well - known observation by santayana , which is also relevant to the pentaquark story , is that `` scepticism is the chastity of the intellect , and it is shameful to surrender it too soon or to the first comer . ''",
