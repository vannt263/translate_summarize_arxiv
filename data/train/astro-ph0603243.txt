    "zeplin - iii is a two - phase ( liquid / gas ) xenon detector developed by the uk dark matter collaboration and international partners , which will try to identify and measure galactic dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles , or wimps @xcite . upon completion of physics testing now underway at imperial college london , the system may join the zeplin - ii @xcite and drift - iia @xcite experiments already operating 1100  m underground in our laboratory at the boulby mine ( north yorkshire , uk ) .",
    "two - phase emission detectors based on the noble gases date back several decades @xcite , but this technology has gained momentum since the zeplin collaboration first explored the potential of high - field xenon systems @xcite .",
    "the operating principle is that different particle species generate different amounts of scintillation light and ionisation charge in liquid xenon ( lxe ) .",
    "the ratio between these two signal channels provides a powerful technique to discriminate between electron and nuclear recoil interactions .",
    "wimps are expected to scatter elastically off xe atoms , much like neutrons , and the recoiling nucleus will produce a different signature to @xmath1-ray interactions and other sources of electron recoils .",
    "wimp detectors differ from more traditional detectors of nuclear radiation in that they require : i ) extremely low radioactive and cosmic - ray backgrounds , addressed by the use of radio - pure materials and operation deep underground ; ii ) excellent discrimination of the remaining background events , hopefully better than 1000:1 rejection efficiency for electron recoils ; iii ) a low energy threshold for nuclear recoils , since the kinematics of wimp - nucleus scattering results in a very soft recoil spectrum ( @xmath2100  kev ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations are essential in these key areas .",
    "acceptable levels of trace contamination must be assessed for all detector materials , requiring simulations of internal and external backgrounds expected from each component .",
    "cosmic - ray - induced backgrounds also need careful calculation , since experimental measurements would require nothing short of a dedicated wimp detector .",
    "having established the residual electron / photon and neutron event rates , the level of discrimination and energy threshold which can realistically be achieved must be calculated with the help of detailed detector simulations  and possibly fed back to the design process .",
    "in addition , the data produced by two - phase detectors are often complex , and particular simulations are required to help extract actual physics parameters .",
    "finally , realistic datasets help with planning the data acquisition electronics and the data analysis software .",
    "in this paper we describe a simulation tool used throughout this process @xcite , based on the geant4 monte carlo toolkit @xcite .",
    "the package builds upon previous simulation work @xcite and experimental measurements with high - field , two - phase prototype detectors @xcite .",
    "after overviewing the detector and the software , a description is given of the simulation models used to calculate the detector response .",
    "simulation results are then presented for the dominant background contributions , calibration runs with @xmath1 and neutron sources , and position reconstruction capabilities , leading to a predicted performance of the instrument as a wimp detector .",
    "the wimp target is housed in a 1-m tall vacuum cryostat , which contains a xenon vessel sitting on top of a liquid nitrogen reservoir .",
    "the latter cools the xenon chamber to around @xmath3 .",
    "all major metal components of the detector are made from high - purity c101 copper . inside the xenon vessel",
    "an array of 31 2-inch photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) is immersed in the liquid phase , looking up to a @xmath440-mm thick lxe disk topped by a 5-mm layer of gas .",
    "up to 40  kv can be applied between a polished copper plate covering the gas phase ( hereafter ` anode mirror ' ) and a metal wire grid located 35  mm below the liquid surface ( ` cathode grid ' ) , defining the active region of the detector . a second wire grid ( ` pmt grid ' ) placed just above the array ( 5  mm below the cathode )",
    "defines a reverse field region which suppresses secondary signals from low - energy photons from the pmts and helps protect the pmt photocathodes from stray electric fields .",
    "the pmts , arranged in a closely - packed hexagonal array , are encased in 2-inch holes bored in a copper screen in order to prevent optical cross - talk .",
    "a lower plate ( ` pmt mirror ' ) covers the array ; this mirror has conical cuts around the pmt windows intended to improve the light collection and prevent the escape of stray light generated around the pmt bodies .",
    "the diameter of the active lxe volume is approximately 40  cm , while that of the pmt array is 34  cm .",
    "the array is powered by a network of thin copper plates located inside the xenon vessel , which provides common connection to each dynode on all the pmts and hence reduces the number of required feedthroughs quite considerably .",
    "a detailed description of the detector construction is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we refer to fig .",
    "[ geometry ] for the model representation of the zeplin - iii geometry .",
    "when a particle interacts in lxe , vuv scintillation light is promptly produced .",
    "in addition , a strong electric field ( up to @xmath5  kv / cm ) prevents most of the ionisation charge produced around the particle track from recombining .",
    "the extracted charge carriers drift upward to the liquid surface , and are emitted into the gas phase . here , the strong electric field ( double that of the liquid phase ) leads to the production of further vuv photons , by the process known as electroluminescence or proportional scintillation . therefore , both scintillation and ionisation signals give rise to optical signatures which are detected with the same pmt array , the time separation between them being proportional to the vertical ( @xmath6 ) coordinate .",
    "we label these signals as the ` primary ' and the ` secondary ' , or s1 and s2 , respectively .",
    "the ratio s2/s1 is higher for electrons than nuclear recoils . in low - energy atom - atom collisions ,",
    "most of the energy loss goes into recoil of the nuclei and only a small fraction converts into electronic loss ( i.e. electron excitation / ionisation ) .",
    "electron/@xmath1-ray interactions act directly on the outer atomic electrons , yielding more ionisation charge .",
    "the 31 pmt signals are fed into wideband amplifiers and split into a dual - range data acquisition system ( daq ) .",
    "a large dynamic range ensures sensitivity to very small primaries containing only a few photoelectrons ( phe ) as well as large secondaries without saturation .",
    "all 62 channels are sampled at 500  ms / s by 8-bit digitisers .",
    "the main requirements underlying the software design were : i ) that it should model the transport and interactions of particles internal and external to the detector , down to the production of electron and nuclear recoils ; ii ) simulate the physical processes involved in the generation of the optical response to scintillation and electroluminescence ; iii ) generate the electrical response ( digitised voltage timelines ) for all channels in order to produce realistic datasets ; iv ) operating parameters should be easily modified by the user , in particular the lxe height and the applied electric field ; v ) it should be user friendly .",
    "geant4 is arguably the most comprehensive toolkit of its kind , and the only one to fulfil the above requirements . besides an extensive list of physics models , its modular and transparent design means that new ones can be easily added ( e.g. electroluminescence ) .",
    "its flexibility allows further processing of simulated events ( daq , event display , data analysis , etc . ) .",
    "versatile specification of the primary particle generator means that individual particles , radioisotopes and sources with complex spatial and energy distributions can be specified at run time .",
    "finally , user - interfaces are easily created , allowing the user to control most physics parameters without having to delve into the code itself .",
    "this is important since many optical and charge transport properties are still ill - defined , and different parameter combinations have to be assessed . in this package , primary generator",
    ", detector and physics parameters can be set interactively by commands and macros available for many simulation tasks .",
    "two geometry representations have been set up . the one shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] includes most detector components located above the liquid nitrogen vessel .",
    "a second geometry implements only the ( optically ) active region , comprised between the pmt photocathodes and the anode mirror . less computationally demanding than the full model , this is useful for light collection and similar studies .",
    "both produce exactly the same optical response .",
    "the lxe height , chosen by default to be 35  mm above the cathode ( leaving 5  mm of gas below the anode mirror ) can also be set between runs .",
    "this entails modifying the electric field distribution as well as optical and other properties , as explained below .",
    "additional external components will be included at a future stage , namely a scintillator veto system surrounding the detector as well as hydrocarbon and lead shielding for external neutrons and @xmath1-rays , respectively .",
    "optical ray - tracing in the detector takes into account the optical constants of liquid and gaseous xenon , the angular reflectivities of copper surfaces and electrode grids , and the optical and detection properties of the pmts , all of which are defined at the xenon scintillation wavelength of @xmath7  nm ( 7  ev ) .    for lxe a refractive index @xmath8=1.69 and an attenuation length of 36.4  cm",
    "were considered @xcite . although the latter is probably dominated by rayleigh scattering ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , as well as preliminary results from our zeplin - ii detector ) , only photo - absorption was considered here  the difference in light collection is relatively small .",
    "the angular reflectivity of copper is quite uncertain at vuv wavelengths , depending on the surface finish , oxidation state and possible lxe condensation onto the cold surfaces .",
    "a single measurement was found , indicating @xmath9=25% for normal incidence for a clean - cut surface @xcite ; a more conservative 15% was adopted instead .",
    "the geant4 ` unified ' model @xcite was chosen to treat the angular reflection from metal surfaces ; the parameter @xmath10 , which characterises the gaussian smearing of the exit angle in this model , was set to @xmath11 , producing a half - width @xmath1245@xmath13 for normal incidence .",
    "we point out that the choice of model is not informed by experimental data  lacking for many materials for this wavelength range . a high - reflectivity case ( @xmath9=90% for anode and pmt mirrors ) was also considered , to assess the benefit of electroplating the mirrors in a future upgrade .",
    "the two electrode grids ( wire - wound ) are implemented as continuous dielectric sheets with refractive index matched to that of lxe ( no fresnel reflection ) but with an absorption length chosen to give 10% absorption at normal incidence ( equal to the grid wire / pitch ratio ) .",
    "the dielectric absorption mimics the obscuration of light with angle of incidence to good approximation for all but the largest angles with respect to the grid normal .",
    "the pmt models consider a curved quartz window supporting an opaque photocathode with a user - defined quantum efficiency ( qe ) .",
    "a photon is detected as a photoelectron depending on the outcome of a random throw .",
    "note that manufacture - quoted qes are usually measured in air or vacuum .",
    "a slightly better optical match is obtained when pmts are immersed in lxe due to the similar refractive indices ( @xmath8=1.6 for quartz ) . however , given that other losses are also considered ( e.g. window absorption and reflection from metal fingers deposited onto it for improved low - temperature performance ) , we can assign the measured pmt qe to the photocathode without major error .",
    "low - temperature qes average 30% for xenon scintillation for the zeplin - iii phototubes @xcite .",
    "the flat , disk - shaped lxe target ensures uniform electric fields ( and light collection ) above the pmt array . inside this central ( ` fiducial ' ) volume",
    ", high discrimination efficiency should be achieved .",
    "interactions in outlying regions , which can probe non - vertical fringe fields , may still be corrected ( or rejected ) by use of 3-dimensional event information . to ensure that this procedure is well understood , the simulation uses detailed electric field models for both phases .",
    "this is particularly important for the electroluminescence signal : the field determines not only how much ionisation is extracted from the interaction site , but also its drift time to the surface , the emission probability and location , the electroluminescence yield in the gas and the temporal development of the signal .",
    "two - dimensional electric field maps are used by the electroluminescence model ; by exploiting the cylindrical symmetry of the target , these maps can be kept small and are easily navigated .",
    "the standard geant4 tracking kernel is applied to all other particles , so there is no penalty to other processes .",
    "the ansys @xcite finite - element software was used to produce field maps for several gas gaps , for a reference voltage of 1  v between the anode mirror and the cathode grid .",
    "the reverse - field region below the cathode grid , which suppresses s2 signals from low - energy pmt photons , is not implemented .",
    "dielectric constants for the gas and liquid phases are @xmath14=1 and @xmath15=2 , respectively .",
    "the total inter - electrode voltage ( set interactively ) scales the chosen field map to obtain the correct electric field strength .",
    "[ field ]  ( left ) represents the ansys contour plot and the optimised meshing for the default map ( 5  mm gas ) .",
    "electron trajectories obtained with a simple field navigation are shown in fig .",
    "[ field ]  ( right ) .",
    "note that the field is constant above the array , well away from the edge .      as a scintillator lxe compares favourably with the best crystals , yielding some 60 photons per kev of energy deposited ( electron equivalent , hereafter ` kevee ' ) @xcite .",
    "the vuv luminescence is produced by the decay of singlet and triplet states of the xe@xmath16 excimer .",
    "these can be excited directly by the interacting particle or as a result of recombination along the particle track ( xe@xmath17+@xmath18@xmath19xe@xmath16)@xcite .",
    "recombination is very efficient for nuclear recoil interactions , and so their scintillation is faster ( @xmath20  ns in a single - exponential approximation ) than for electrons ( @xmath21  ns , depending on energy ) @xcite .",
    "this discrimination technique was exploited in the zeplin - i detector @xcite .",
    "the scintillation efficiency for nuclear recoils is lower than for electron interactions of the same energy .",
    "a zero - field quenching factor @xmath22=0.22 @xcite was used in the simulation regardless of energy .",
    "very recent data agree with this value at a few tens of kev ( nuclear - recoil energy , ` kevnr ' ) , but may indicate some reduction at lower energies @xcite .",
    "an external electric field suppresses recombination to a varying degree , affecting mainly the light yield and decay times for electron recoils , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ scint ] .",
    "the scintillation model ( adapted from that implemented in geant4 ) assumes a uniform electric field across both phases , i.e. yields and time constants are position - independent .",
    "this is not unreasonable considering that , for the range of interesting fields , these properties do not vary appreciably .",
    "the default yields for electron and nuclear recoils were set at 18  photons / kev and 12  photons / kev , respectively , at the nominal 8  kv / cm field .",
    "the number of vuv photons is gaussian - distributed ( except when fewer than 10 , in which case poisson deviates are used ) , with unity fano factor  note that for relatively small s1 the overall energy resolution is instead dominated by photoelectron statistics .",
    "although pulse - shape analysis of s1 can not provide as good a discrimination as in a zero - field detector , this may still prove a valuable diagnostic technique for calibration runs .",
    "for this reason , some timing properties were implemented in the scintillation model : a single - exponential decay is assumed , with time constants of 26  ns for electrons and 16  ns for recoils .",
    "it should be pointed out that the scintillation and ionisation signals are correlated event - by - event , since recombination will contribute to either one or the other @xcite .",
    "this correlation has not been taken into account in this model .",
    "however , it can improve the discrimination ability of two - phase detectors @xcite .      under the strong electric field ,",
    "ionisation electrons are extracted from the interaction site and drifted upward to the liquid surface ; once emitted into the gas phase they acquire enough energy to generate many vuv photons by electroluminescence .",
    "the s2 signal is proportional to the number of charge carriers extracted from the liquid , as well as the electric field and path length in the gas .",
    "the number of electrons escaping recombination near the interaction site in lxe is calculated according to the electric field strength , the type of interacting particle and its energy .",
    "an energy @xmath23 deposited in the liquid creates @xmath24 free carriers , where @xmath25 is the mean energy required to create an electron - ion pair at infinite field . for @xmath1-like interactions",
    ", we adopted @xmath26=15.6  ev @xcite .",
    "some of the ionisation produced will recombine at finite field ",
    "this fraction depending on the @xmath1-ray energy .",
    "note that our present understanding of charge recombination is not accurate enough to constitute a microscopic model ; for this reason , the dependence on particle energy ( as opposed to energy deposited in lxe ) is the only link to experimental data .",
    "we define a fractional charge yield , @xmath27 , representing the number of carriers that escape recombination , as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath1-ray energy in kev and @xmath30 is the field strength in kv / cm @xcite .",
    "this function parameterises experimental data found in ref .",
    "@xcite and is plotted in fig .",
    "[ elum ]  a ) for the photon energies considered in that study .",
    "the ionisation yield for nuclear recoils was unknown at the start of this work , but it was thought to be much smaller than that for electron recoils .",
    "it was reasoned that , to first approximation , the number of ionisations and that of excitations producing scintillation would be suppressed by a similar amount , i.e. @xmath31=@xmath26/qf@xmath471  ev . under a finite electric field , only a fraction of this ionisation can be extracted from the nuclear track . establishing a parallel with @xmath32-particle ionisation yields , we adopted a linear dependence with field giving @xmath33 charge yield at 10  kv / cm .",
    "combining these two figures , we predicted that zeplin - iii should produce some 40 electrons from a 30  kev nuclear recoil ( 1.3  e@xmath34/kevnr ) .",
    "recent measurements suggest that nuclear - recoil ionisation may not be a linear function of either recoil energy or electric field , and could be 34 times higher than anticipated at 30 kevnr at half the maximum zeplin  iii field @xcite .",
    "in view of this , some simulations were repeated with a yield 4 times higher than the default value ( 5.2  e@xmath34/kevnr ) , but still proportional to recoil energy and field .",
    "the charge carriers released from each interaction site are tracked in the electric field until reaching either the liquid surface or a side - electrode .",

    "although this effect is not negligible when compared to the width of s2 itself , it can be taken into account at a later stage .    upon reaching the surface , the normal component of the electric field in the liquid",

    "recently , photon yields measured with saturated xenon vapour in equilibrium with the liquid phase were shown to be higher than those observed in the warm gas ( the latter being consistent with previous experiments ) @xcite .",
    "this brings the prospect of even higher gain in the s2 channel .",
    "the energy resolution achievable in s2 is dominated by fluctuations of the number of ionisation electrons extracted from the track , with lesser contributions from the ensuing stages ( emission into the gas , electroluminescence and photon detection ) .",
    "it has long been acknowledged that the intrinsic resolution achievable by charge readout in lxe is worse than both the calculated fano factor ( @xmath44=0.04 , @xcite ) and the poisson limit ( @xmath44=1 )  see e.g. @xcite . this has been attributed to the ( small - number ) statistics of @xmath45-ray production acting together with charge recombination , which can persist even under electric fields as high as 20  kv / cm @xcite .",
    "this effect is likely to be less marked for energies up to a few tens of kevee .",

    "construction from mainly high - purity copper ( u / th levels @xmath541  ppb ) and the relatively high threshold for ( @xmath32,n ) in cu ensure a very low neutron background from the vicinity of the target from most components , with the notable exception of the pmts .",

    "increasing the latter ( e.g. from 10@xmath77:1 to 10@xmath68:1 ) also raises the energy threshold , as illustrated in figs .  [ efficiency ] ( fortunately , it also decreases the number of neutron events ) .",

    "this is due to the fact that the reduced energy acceptance for nuclear recoils affects the neutron background more than the wimp - induced spectrum at these energies .",
    "this sensitivity is similar to the original design prediction , and confirms that zeplin - iii can probe deep into the parameter space favoured by susy in its original design .",
    "an active veto system installed around the detector can be used to reject events in coincidence with the target .",
    "a veto efficiency of 50% can be realistically achieved for internal neutrons .",
    "a @xmath1-ray veto efficiency of @xmath470% has been deemed possible @xcite .",
    "a relatively modest factor of 2 in wimp sensitivity can be gained in this way , assuming the veto itself does not contribute to neutron and @xmath1 backgrounds .",
    "a very worthwhile planned upgrade is the replacement of the phototubes with newly - developed low - radioactivity ones .",
    "a ten - fold reduction in background ( neutrons and @xmath1s ) can be realistically achieved .",
    "this would make pmt neutron rates in the target comparable to external neutron backgrounds , pushing the wimp - nucleon cross - section sensitivity down to @xmath84  pb . with these two upgrades in place zeplin - iii would compete favourably with much larger targets and more expensive technologies being considered around the world .",
    "the zeplin - iii performance as a wimp detector has been assessed using a fully - featured , realistic simulation tool based on geant4 .",
    "the original sensitivity of a few times @xmath0  pb is confirmed and many aspects of the detector performance have been predicted in anticipation of tests now being carried out in the laboratory .",
    "some caution must be exercised in interpreting some of these results , notably the discrimination efficiencies and the sensitivity limits derived from them .",
    "it is hard to conceive a simulation model which could accurately characterise the tails of the @xmath1 and recoil distributions to better than 1 part in 10@xmath68 .",
    "however , most parameters were conservatively chosen , and the real performance could actually surpass that predicted in this work .",
    "we shall now discuss some of these uncertainties .",
    "the reference light yield is likely to be higher than 3.4  phe / kev : early results from our zeplin - ii detector ( now operating underground ) as well as dedicated tests using zeplin - iii during its first commissioning run at imperial college @xcite suggest that both the scintillation yield and the photon absorption length in lxe are higher than considered in this simulation , perhaps due to the outstanding purity levels required for charge drift in these large chambers .",
    "this will translate directly into an improvement in energy threshold .",
    "new experimental evidence @xcite is pointing to larger ionisation yields from nuclear recoils than originally anticipated , more in line with the high - yield scenario considered here .",
    "significantly , it appears that the wimp sensitivity is remarkably unaffected , at least in this energy range .",
    "the ionisation fano factor can affect more the potential of lxe as a wimp target , and @xmath44 is not really known for electron and nuclear recoil energies of interest . a combination of a high ionisation yield ( @xmath375  e@xmath34/kevnr ) and large fano factor ( @xmath44@xmath3710 )",
    "could make two - phase xenon detectors less attractive a technology for wimp searches , but this combination is not likely . in addition , we note that the anti - correlation between s1 and s2 , due to the fact that ionisation electrons contribute to either one or the other channel , can be exploited to improve the discrimination efficiency during data analysis .",
    "the new recoil ionisation data also reveal a weak dependence on electric field above @xmath371  kv / cm ( unlike that indicated in fig .",
    "[ elum ]  a ) .",
    "given that charge extraction from electron recoils is still increasing at that field strength , the advantage of high - field operation may prove very significant .",
    "moreover , it is possible that a higher field may decrease the fano factor and lead to better discrimination , simply because more charge is extracted from the interaction site .",
    "as it stands , zeplin - iii should be able to produce a world - beating sensitivity before rival systems and other technologies",
    ". with a further upgrade of the phototubes a very significant gain in sensitivity can be achieved , since these dominate both the neutron and @xmath1-ray backgrounds .",
