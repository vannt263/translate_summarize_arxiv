    "it is well - known that very strong magnetic fields may appear on the surface of white dwarfs , @xmath12 g and neutron stars , @xmath13 g ( for latter case they can be even stronger ) .",
    "it seems natural to expect that in a vicinity of the surface atomic and molecular systems can occur . for many years",
    "this assumption motivates a development of atomic - molecular physics in a strong magnetic field since it might lead to understanding of the spectra of these compact stars .",
    "so far , a major attention was paid to a study of one - electron atomic and molecular systems ( for s review see e.g. @xcite ) . during the last years",
    "it was predicted the existence of many exotic , strongly bound one - electron molecular system . in turn",
    ", two - electron systems had explored very little being mostly focused to a study of atomic - type systems @xmath14 with the only exception of the @xmath15 molecule ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . just recently ,",
    "a first detailed study of the molecular ion @xmath16 was carried out @xcite .",
    "it manifested quite surprising evolution of the ground state as a magnetic field increases .",
    "a goal of the present paper is to make a first study of the coulomb system @xmath0 in a magnetic field and establish the existence of the molecular ion @xmath1 and its excited states .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the molecular ion @xmath1 exists in metastable state in field - free case ( see e.g. @xcite ) being characterized by a well - pronounced potential well at a finite internuclear distance .",
    "atomic units are used throughout ( @xmath17=@xmath18=@xmath19=1 ) , although energies are expressed in rydbergs ( ry ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath20 is given in a.u . with @xmath21 .",
    "let us consider the coulomb system @xmath0 placed in a uniform constant magnetic field .",
    "we assume that the @xmath3particles are infinitely massive ( born - oppenheimer approximation of zero order ) .",
    "they are situated along the magnetic field line ( parallel configuration ) .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes this system when the magnetic field is oriented along the @xmath22 direction , @xmath23 is written as follows @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the 3-vector of the momentum of the @xmath26th - electron , the index @xmath27 runs over the @xmath3particles @xmath28 and @xmath20 , @xmath29 is the interelectron distance and @xmath30 is the operator of the total spin .",
    "@xmath31 is a vector potential which corresponds to the constant uniform magnetic field @xmath32 chosen in the symmetric gauge , @xmath33 after substitution of ( 2 ) to ( 1 ) we arrive at the hamiltonian in the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the z - components of the total angular momentum and total spin , respectively .",
    "the variable @xmath37 is the distance from @xmath38th electron to @xmath39axis .",
    "the problem under study is characterized by three integrals of motion : ( i ) the operator of the @xmath22-component of the total angular momentum ( projection of the angular momentum on the magnetic field direction ) giving rise to the magnetic quantum number @xmath40 , ( ii ) the spatial parity operator @xmath41 which has eigenvalues @xmath42(gerade / ungerade ) ( iii ) the operator of the @xmath22-component of the total spin ( projection of the total spin on the magnetic field direction ) giving rise to the spin quantum number @xmath43 .",
    "hence , to any eigenstate three explicit quantum numbers can be assigned : the magnetic quantum number @xmath40 , the parity @xmath44 and the spin quantum number @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the space of eigenstates is split into subspaces ( sectors ) with each of them being characterized by definite values of @xmath40 , @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is worth noting the hamiltonian @xmath45 is also invariant with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( z - parity operator @xmath48 ) with quantum numbers @xmath49 for positive / negative @xmath22-parity ( this symmetry accounts for the interchange of the nuclei a and b ) .",
    "thus , to classify eigenstates we follow the convention widely accepted in molecular physics using the quantum numbers @xmath40 , @xmath50 and @xmath44 . in particular",
    ", the notation is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the spin multiplicity and corresponds to @xmath53 for singlet ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 for triplet ( @xmath56 ) , for the label @xmath57 greek letters @xmath58 are used that correspond to the states with @xmath59 , respectively , and the subscript @xmath44 ( the spatial parity quantum number ) will take gerade / ungerade(@xmath60 ) labels describing positive @xmath61 and negative @xmath62 parity states . however , there exists a relation between the quantum numbers corresponding to the @xmath22-parity ( interchange of nuclei a and b ) and the spatial parity : @xmath63 we restrict our consideration to the states with @xmath64 because the ground state of a sector with @xmath65 always has larger total energy than those with @xmath66 .    as a method to explore the problem the variational procedure is used .",
    "the recipe of choice of trial functions is based on arguments of physical relevance ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "eventually , a trial function for the state with magnetic quantum number @xmath40 is chosen in a form @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 stands for spin singlet ( @xmath54 ) and triplet states @xmath70 , respectively , when @xmath71 stands for nuclear gerade and ungerade states , respectively .",
    "the @xmath72 is the operator which interchanges electrons ( 1 @xmath73 2 ) and @xmath74 is the operator which interchanges the two nuclei @xmath28 and @xmath20 .",
    "the parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are variational parameters . if the internuclear distance @xmath78 is taken into account as a variational parameter the trial function ( [ ansatz ] ) depends on eight parameters .",
    "calculations were performed using the minimization package minuit from cern - lib .",
    "multidimensional integration was carried out using a dynamical partitioning procedure : the domain of integration was divided into subdomains following an integrand profile and then each subdomain was integrated separately ( for details see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "numerical integration was done with a relative accuracy of @xmath79 by use of the adaptive d01fcf routine from nag - lib .",
    "computations were performed on a dual dell pc with two xeon processors of 2.8ghz each ( icn ) , 54-node fenomec and 32-node tochitl clusters ( unam ) and duke dual dell pc with two xeon processors of 3.06ghz each ( cinvestav ) .",
    "it is known that in field - free case the @xmath1 molecular ion exists in the state @xmath6 ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) as a metastable state - it decays to @xmath83 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a natural goal is to check the existence of bound state of the system @xmath0 in parallel configuration in presence of the magnetic field ranging @xmath84 g . to carry out such a study",
    "the trial function ( [ ansatz ] ) with @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath82 is used , which depends on 8 variational parameters .",
    "the calculations indicate clearly the existence of a minimum in the total energy curve @xmath87 for all magnetic fields @xmath88 .",
    "the concrete results for the @xmath89 state are presented in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "this state is a short - lived state for weak magnetic fields where its total energy curve lies above the total energy in the dissociation channel to two separate helium ions @xmath90 , for which the spins of electrons in both @xmath91 are antiparallel to the magnetic field direction . in general , as the magnetic field strength grows , the total energy increases , the system becomes more bound - the double ionization energy @xmath92 increases and more compact ( the internuclear equilibrium distance decreases ) .",

    "the crossing occurs of the total energy curve at the equilibrium internuclear distance for the @xmath6 state and the ( repulsive ) total energy curve of the @xmath8 state .",
