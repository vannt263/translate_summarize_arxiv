    "the homogeneous electron gas , a model solid whose positive ionic charges are smeared throughout the whole crystal volume to yield a shapeless , uniform positive background ( whence the nickname of jellium ) has provided , since the very start of quantum mechanics , a key conceptual reference and a mine of information for solid  state and many  body theorists.@xcite initially it was mostly regarded as an approximation of the true distribution of valence electrons in simple metals , since , in spite of its crudity , it could already account for some of their experimental properties.@xcite although the importance of valence  charge inhomogeneites in real materials was soon recognized ( and described first by perturbation@xcite and later by self",
