    "the significance of the fidelity to witness a qpt has been testified in a large variety of models including the dicke model @xcite , 1d xy model in a transverse field @xcite , quadratic fermion hamiltonians @xcite , and bose - hubbard model @xcite ( for a review , please refer to ref .",

    "the fidelity susceptibility @xcite was proposed .",
    "the fidelity susceptibility is the leading response of the fidelity to the external perturbation .",
    "it has been found to be related to the correlation function of the driving term in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "basing on this general relation , a scaling relation between the size dependence of the fidelity susceptibility , the dynamic exponent , and the scaling dimension of the driving term was also obtained through scaling transformation @xcite .",
    "these suggest that the fidelity susceptibility could be a potential candidate to witness the landau type qpts through its divergence at the critical point . as a pure hilbert space",
    "geometrical quantity , the application of the fidelity and fidelity susceptibility does not require any a prior knowledge in the system s symmetry and this make it advantageous to the study of qpts . this approach has also been successfully applied to detect the topological qpt , which fall beyond the framework of the spontaneous symmetry - breaking theory , in the 2d kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "recently , a equality relating the fidelity susceptibility and the spectral function was also derived @xcite .",
    "this makes the fidelity susceptibility directly measurable in experiments via neutron scattering or the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy(arpes ) techniques .",

    ", we argued that the fidelity susceptibility diverges at some infinitesimal distance away from the critical point in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we also studied the fidelity susceptibility in the 1d extended hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "the model exhibits a very rich ground state phase diagram consisting of the charge - density wave ( cdw ) , spin - density wave ( sdw ) , phase separation ( ps ) , singlet - superconducting ( ss ) , triplet - superconducting ( ts ) and bond - order wave ( bow ) phases . to the best of our knowledge",

    "consider a many - body system , the hamiltonian can be generally written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the external driving parameter and @xmath2 is the driving hamiltonian . denoting the eigenstates and eigenenergies as @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively such that @xmath5 .",
    "the ground state fidelity of a pure state is defined as @xcite @xmath6 which measures the overlap between the two ground states at a different @xmath1 .",
    "geometrically , the fidelity represents the angular distance between the two ground states differed by a small value of the driving parameter @xmath7 in the hilbert space .",
    "it has a range between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . if the two states are the same up to a phase factor , the fidelity is equal to one .",

    "therefore , one may expect that both the divergence of the fidelity susceptibility and the second derivative of the ground state energy at the critical point is intrinsically due to the vanishing of the energy gap in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",

    "although much effort has been devoted to study the extended hubbard model in the past , there remain controversies in its ground state phase diagram . for positive @xmath31 and @xmath66 , while the strong coupling theories predicted the cdw - sdw phase transition to be first order , the weak coupling theories tell that it is continuous . by studying the excitation spectra with numerical exact diagonalization , nakamura pointed out that there also exist a spontaneous dimerized phase , the bond - order wave ( bow ) phase , in a narrow region between the sdw phase and the cdw phase up to a tricritical point @xcite . on the other hand , jeckelmann argued that the bow phase only exits on a short segment of the critical line , rather than a stripe , of the cdw - sdw transition from dmrg studies @xcite .",

    "the huge peak there may be understood by the fact that the transition is a first order transition .",
    "the transition is caused by a level - crossing between the ground state and the excited state in the energy spectrum .",
    "the crossing occurs even in a very small system .",
    "so the fidelity as a measure of the overlap between the ground state differed by a small @xmath31 should have a sharp drop at the critical point .",
    "this drop in fidelity is then reflected in the peak of the fidelity susceptibility .",

    "if @xmath31 increases and gradually becomes positive ( but still not reaching the sdw phase ) , the on - site interaction term would like to break the electron pairs and one doubly occupied site tends to be singly occupied .",
    "the weight of @xmath76 increases and at some positive value of @xmath31 , ps(b ) would become the dominate configuration in the ground state .",

    "the energy difference between the ps(a ) and ps(b ) configuration is @xmath31 and this difference becomes negligible when @xmath19 is large .",

    "[ fig : fs_ehm_ed_du ] also reveals the sdw - cdw phase transition .",
    "the peaks in the fidelity susceptibility are stronger in the large @xmath31 and @xmath66 regime than in the small @xmath31 and @xmath66 region .",
    "this is because the phase transition there is a discontinuous one . for the weak and intermediate coupling regime ,",
    "the phase boundary and its detail , for examples the bow phase , is merely resolved .",
