    "the polarization entanglement of spatially separated photon pairs , generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) , has been used in a variety of quantum experiments to demonstrate quantum teleportation , entanglement - based quantum cryptography , bell - inequality violations , and others  @xcite .",
    "these spdc photon pairs are also entangled in their wave vectors .",
    "the entanglement in wave - vector space is used in various experiments , such as quantum imaging  @xcite , photonic de broglie wavelength measurement  @xcite , quantum interference  @xcite , and quantum lithography  @xcite .",
    "it was claimed and experimentally verified that they have higher resolution than the classical limit , which will be used to various applications .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of quantum imaging , the information about the shape of a spatial filter is transferred by entangled photon pairs , therefore it is useful for secure two - dimensional information transfer . compared with the case using the polarization entanglement , it can send much more information by the entanglement of the wave - vector space taking an advantage of the continuity of the entangled parameter . a protocol for quantum key distribution",
    "was proposed based on a system whose dimension is higher than 2 in ref.@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "a frequency entanglement was used to measure the spectroscopic property of a sample , which can also be used for nonlocal pulse shaping  @xcite .",
    "the state was maximally entangled by using a continuous - wave ( cw ) pump  @xcite . focusing the pump on a spdc crystal by an objective lens , the bandwidth of spdc was extended .",
    "it enabled to measure the absorption spectrum of a sample in broadband .",
    "various types of spectroscopic measurements were performed utilizing classical light source including sophisticatedly constructed extremely short pulses  @xcite . however , in the following situations , spectroscopy utilizing the frequency entanglement can be a powerful way to measure the spectroscopic properties of the sample .",
    "one of the situations is the case when it is difficult to analyze frequency of photons transmitted through an absorptive sample .",
    "for example , to measure the spectroscopic property of a sample in vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) range , a spectrometer must be settled in a vacuum chamber in case of the conventional vuv spectroscopy , and the spectrometer must be aligned and controlled under the vacuum condition . however , in case of spectroscopy using the frequency - entangled photon pair consists of a vuv photon and a longer wavelength photon ( like a visible photon ) , the vuv photon transmitted thorough the sample is to be detected by the photodetector without capability of energy resolution .",
    "instead the visible photon is to be resolved by a spectrometer in the atmospheric pressure which is easily handled .",
    "this is one of the useful features of this method .",
    "the method is also useful when the sample is in space and the photons transmitted through the sample are not easy to be resolved by their energy .",
    "another situation is the case when the spectroscopic property of a fragile sample is to be measured in infrared range .",
    "the power of the light source must be very low not to damage the sample , and yet an infrared photodetector is usually so noisy that a signal - to - noise ratio is very low in the measurement using the classical light source .",
    "however , when the frequency - entangled photon pairs are used , the coincidence counts are measured , then one of the photons of each photon pair works as a timing gate for the measurement of another photon of the pair which is to be resolved by its energy , and the signal - to - noise ratio is expected to be enhanced substantially .",
    "this is another advantage of this method .",
    "the spdc photon pairs are emitted conically from the point where the pump light is focused on the beta - barium borate ( bbo ) crystal . using a parabolic mirror ,",
    "all spdc photon pairs in the light cones are collimated without achromatic aberration , and travel to a beam splitter without expanding their beam diameters keeping their polarization entanglement .",
    "it is not aimed to use the polarization in this experiment , so signal and idler photons are separated from each other by a polarizing beam splitter which destroys the polarization entanglement . when a nonpolarizing beam splitter is used in place of the polarizing beam splitter ,",
    "the photon pairs detected at the photon counters have polarization entanglement , which can be used for quantum cryptography  @xcite . therefore using the polarization entanglement and the frequency entanglement simultaneously , it will become possible to implement wavelength - division multiplexing ( wdm ) , quantum cryptography , or wdm quantum key distribution , which can send much more information compared with the case of polarization - only entanglement .",

    "frequency - nondegenerate photon pairs are generated by spdc in a 1-mm - thick type - ii bbo ( @xmath0-bab@xmath1o@xmath2 ) crystal pumped by the second harmonic light ( 1.5  mw ) of a cw ti : sapphire laser operated at 859.4  nm .",
    "to generate photon pairs by bandwidth extended spdc , the pump light is focused on the bbo crystal by a microscope objective lens of 8-mm focal length ( l1 ) .",
    "generated spdc photons diversing from the focal waist are collimated by an off - axis parabolic mirror ( m ) of 25.4-mm focal length . a prism pair ( p1,p2 )",
    "is used to eliminate the remainder of the pump light , which can be a noise source in the experiments .",
    "when the light beam passes through the prism pairs , the beam height was lowered by a mirror ( m3 ) , and only the spdc pairs are picked out by another mirror ( m2 ) .",
    "the signal and idler photons were separated from each other by a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "vertically polarized photons ( signal ) are reflected by the pbs , and diffracted by a grating ( g ) ( 1400 grooves / mm ) .",
    "horizontally polarized photons ( idler ) pass through the pbs and a partially absorptive sample .",

    "the coincidences are counted by a time - to - amplitude converter / single - channel analyzer ( ortec 567 ) followed by a computer - controlled multichannel pulse - height analyzer ( mca : ortec trump - pci-2k ) .",
    "in this paper , we discuss the application of the frequency - entanglement of spdc photon pairs to absorption spectroscopy .",

    "( [ eq - phasematch ] ) , thinner crystals are preferable for the generation of broadband spdc photon pairs . generally , in our quantum experiments using spdc photon pairs , thick crystals as thick as 5  mm are usually used to obtain high spdc conversion efficiency .",
    "however in this paper broadband spdc photon pairs are indispensable for its spectroscopic measurement , thin crystal of 1-mm thickness is used .",
    "the wavelength resolution of this system is calculated as 4  nm using @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are a gap of grating grooves(@xmath23  mm ) , a fiber diameter ( @xmath24 m ) , and a focal length of lens l2 ( 11  mm ) , respectively .",
    "it is much narrower than the full width of the parametric fluorescence spectrum .    since a cw laser is being used as a pump , the pump bandwidth is also much narrower than the width of the parametric fluorescence spectrum .",
    "it forces the sum of signal and idler frequency to be equal to the pump frequency as @xmath25 , and it entangles a spdc photon pair in its frequency as a signal photon at frequency @xmath26 is generated with an idler photon at frequency @xmath27 .",
    "the wavelength resolution of the system and the pump bandwidth are so narrow that , using some approximations , the absorption spectrum of the sample can be easily calculated as  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a coincidence counting rate when the sample was placed in the idler path , and @xmath30 is the one without the sample .",
    "figure  [ data - coincidence - sample ] shows coincidence counts accumulated for 30 s without a sample when the grating angle is set to diffract the center wavelength of signal light , and the coincidence counts have a peak at the delay time of 18  ns determined by the delay unit .    ]",
    "coincidence counts averaged from 5 to 45  ns except between 14 and 22  ns delay is used for the calculation of a background noise . in this paper , coincidence sum counts",

    "the wavelength calibration is performed using a reflection , zeroth - order diffraction , from the grating . beside the center wavelength of the spdc light ,",
    "the glass sample has two absorption peaks at about 810 and 870  nm ( see fig .  [ data - nd - absorbance ] ) , so the idler photons are absorbed and the coincidence counts are reduced in the spectral ranges .    ]    by dividing the coincidence spectrum without a sample by one with the sample , the absorption spectrum of the sample is calculated , and compared with one measured by a uv - visible - near - infrared spectrophotometer in fig .",
