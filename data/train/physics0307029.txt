    "in physics , one often encounters ` symmetries ' , i.e.  situations when structural fields ( as the permittivity @xmath2 and permeability @xmath3 in classical macroscopic electrodynamics ) are invariant under the given transformation @xmath4 . to obtain general conclusions on dynamic behavior of such symmetric systems without solving the governing dynamic equations",
    ", one needs to know also how the functional fields ( electric and magnetic fields in maxwell s equations ) are transformed with @xmath5 .",
    "physical intuition and experiment is generally what provides us with this knowledge .",
    "important symmetries are with respect to coordinate reflections , as @xmath6 , and coordinate inversion , @xmath7 . these are improper transformations whose jacobian , @xmath8 , has negative determinant : @xmath9 . in numerous textbooks on classical mechanics and electrodynamics ,",
    "vector - like objects are classified into polar , or ordinary vectors , and axial , or pseudo vectors   depending on their behavior under improper transformations .",
    "polar vectors are transformed under inversion as @xmath10 , while axial as @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath10 transformation under coordinate inversion implies that the @xmath12 vector remains unchanged in the reference ( ` absolute ' , ` physical ' ) space . on the opposite , @xmath13",
    "is reflected in the absolute space upon coordinate inversion .",
    "how is it possible at all that such ` unrealistic ' pseudo quantities , dependent on the way we describe them , survive in the physical picture of reality ?",
    "the answer is that they are normally related to observable quantities through the cross product which is defined so that it compensates for the inversion of pseudo vectors in absolute space .",
    "such situation is not quite satisfactory , however .",
    "although many quantities in classical physics are not directly observable ( measurable ) and hence their ` realism ' can always be questioned by a radical empiricist , a natural trend is to put as much ` realism ' into each quantity as possible . in this paper",
    "we discuss an alternative convention for the cross product that allows to eliminate pseudo quantities from classical physics .",
    "interestingly , it turns out to be more than just a matter of convention or convenience once the complex - coordinate transformations are concerned .",
    "classical theory of electromagnetism is usually built upon the fundament of maxwell s equations   a set of dynamic field equations which we write in standard three - vector notation as @xmath14 accompanied , in the simplest case , by the constitutive relations @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 . ] .",
    "dots over characters denote time derivatives ; tildes over @xmath0 and @xmath1 show explicitly that these quantities are regarded as pseudo vectors ( such notation follows j.a.schouten",
    "@xcite ) ; curls @xmath20 are also defined through the pseudo density @xmath21 , @xmath22 , equal to the levi - civita permutation symbol @xmath23 in any coordinate system  @xcite : @xmath24 the @xmath25 sign means equality in a given ( here , in an arbitrary right- or left - hand ) coordinate system . with use of classic ` kernel - index ' notation , we write maxwell s equations ( [ eq : maxwellcommon1 ] ) , ( [ eq : maxwellcommon2 ] ) in a more general form , valid assumably in arbitrary curvilinear , nonorthogonal coordinates : @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the covariant vector and pseudo vector ; @xmath29 and @xmath30 the contravariant vector density and pseudo density of weight @xmath31 , as reflected by gothic kernels ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 the contravariant vector and scalar densities .",

    ", one concludes that the permittivity and permeability are tensor densities of weight @xmath31 , so that they are transformed as @xmath41 an evident alternative to ( [ eq : maxwellcommoninv1 ] ) , ( [ eq : maxwellcommoninv2 ] ) can be constructed by using in ( [ eq : maxwellinv1 ] ) and ( [ eq : maxwellinv2 ] ) the duals @xmath42 and @xmath43 instead , with the ordinary densities @xmath44 and @xmath45 equal to the levi - civita symbol for proper transformations , and changing the sign for improper ones : @xmath46 here @xmath25 stands for equality in an arbitrary but right - hand coordinate system .",
    "we see no reason to agree that the duals constructed with @xmath47 and @xmath45 `` are only meaningful for proper transformations ''  @xcite .",
    "an appropriate form of the generally covariant maxwell s equations   compare to ( [ eq : maxwellcommoninv1 ] ) , ( [ eq : maxwellcommoninv2 ] )   reads @xmath48 given the constitutive relations are @xmath49 and @xmath40 , the transformation laws for the permittivity and permeability are exactly the same as given by ( [ eq : epsmutransform ] ) . in standard three - vector form , ( [ eq : maxwellmyinv1 ] ) , ( [ eq : maxwellmyinv2 ] ) are reduced to the commonly known equations ( [ eq : maxwellcommon1 ] ) , ( [ eq : maxwellcommon2 ] ) except for the tildes : @xmath50 two differences from the standard formulation thus is that all vectors are ` polar ' , and the curl @xmath51 .",
    "this seems perfectly sound were we to assign any ` rigidity ' to the picture of magnetic ` field lines ' for stationary media , instead of absolutizing the cross product definition by use of pseudo permutation objects .",
    "most often in formulas that define observable ( directly measurable ) quantities in terms of @xmath0 or @xmath1 , these latter fields enter in some conjunction with the vectorial product operation   like @xmath52 in ampere s law , @xmath53 in the expression for the lorentz force density , or @xmath54 in the terms in constitutive relations accounting for induced optical activity . if we note that the neighboring tildes , if present , one over cross product and other over the @xmath0 or @xmath1 vector , do always annihilate , we conclude that the ` polar - axial ' and ` pure polar ' formulations of electrodynamics are largely equivalent .",
    "now we also show the equivalence of the two formulations in classifying the eigenmodes of symmetric systems by symmetry arguments . in the following , consider reflection with respect to the @xmath55 surface , @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding jacobian is @xmath57 , its determinant @xmath58 .",
    "it is well known that reflection symmetry of the system , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , allows to replace the whole system by its half , with the pec ( the ` electric wall ' ) or pmc ( the ` magnetic wall ' ) boundary standing in place of the reflection symmetry plane .",
    "we write ( [ eq : maxwellmyinv1 ] ) , ( [ eq : maxwellmyinv2 ] ) in terms of covariant electric and magnetic vectors : @xmath61 in the ` pure polar ' formalism , both vectors are transformed under reflection as @xmath62 at the same time , if material objects are invariant under the given transform , so that @xmath63 and @xmath64 , then maxwell s equations ( [ eq : maxwellmyehinv1 ] ) and ( [ eq : maxwellmyehinv2 ] ) remain unchanged except for the @xmath65 multipliers acquired by the left - hand sides , owing to the transformation rule for @xmath44 ( [ eq : levicivitaordinary ] ) .",
    "thus the admissible new solutions ( in the absence of free charges ) are @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "invariance of the physical system ( material objects plus electromagnetic fields ) to double reflection gives @xmath68 . equating ( [ eqereflect ] ) with @xmath27 and ( [ eqhreflect ] ) with @xmath69 yields @xmath70",
    "these conditions define even modes with the ` numerical ' pmc plane at @xmath55 : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( the ` physical ' perfect conductor planes are not so readily expressed in nonorthogonal coordinates ) .",
    "the conditions obtained in a similar way with @xmath74 define the numerical pec boundary and odd modes .",
    "thus , the ` pure polar ' maxwell s equations ( [ eq : maxwellmyinv1 ] ) , ( [ eq : maxwellmyinv2 ] ) lead to exactly the same mode classification in optical waveguides and resonators exhibiting reflection symmetry as does the standard ` polar - axial ' formulation .",
    "in computational electrodynamics , the dominating way for treating unbounded problems in the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) , finite - difference frequency - domain , or finite - element calculations is with the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) method .",
    "introduced originally in the ` split - field ' formulation by j.p.brenger  @xcite and soon afterwards recast in the ` uniaxial '  @xcite and stretched - coordinate  @xcite forms , the pml concept stands as `` one of the most significant advances in the historical development of the fdtd method ''  @xcite .",
    "the method is closely related to complex - coordinate transforms in classical quantum theory of atomic resonances  @xcite   though this is rarely appreciated by the electromagnetics modelling community . in electromagnetics ,",
    "the method is implemented with surprising ease . without loss of generality",
    ", we consider domain truncation in one , @xmath75 , direction . for media described by diagonal @xmath2 and @xmath3 matrices in the given coordinates , those matrices are modified in the pml regions according to @xmath76 with the complex function @xmath77 where @xmath78 $ ] is the bounded computation - space coordinate , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are real - valued functions equal to 1 and , respectively , 0 over @xmath81\\subset[-b , b]$ ] , while @xmath82 for @xmath83 in order to damp the @xmath84 $ ] oscillatory waves inside the pml regions .",
    "odd - power frequency dependence is included in the imaginary part of ( [ eq : sx ] ) , and hence in ( [ eq : pml1d ] ) , for causality reasons  @xcite .",
    "it is repeatedly claimed that the structure of permittivity and permeability modified within the pmls according to ( [ eq : pml1d ] ) can be recovered by complex coordinate scaling @xmath85 it is easy to see however , that only the ` pure polar ' formulation ( [ eq : maxwellmyinv1 ] ) , ( [ eq : maxwellmyinv2 ] ) leads to ( [ eq : pml1d ] ) .",
    "in contrast , ( [ eq : maxwellcommoninv1 ] ) and ( [ eq : maxwellcommoninv2 ] ) yield @xmath86 which is reduced to ( [ eq : pml1d ] ) for real - valued coordinate squeezing  @xcite , but essentially differs from ( [ eq : pml1d ] ) given the @xmath87 function complex .    ) , ( [ eq : maxwellmyinv2 ] ) is evident.,title=\"fig : \" ] ) , ( [ eq : maxwellmyinv2 ] ) is evident.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    in order to compare the performance of ( [ eq : pml1dwrong ] ) and ( [ eq : pml1d ] ) , we simulated the fundamental mode of a step - index fiber ( @xmath88 as in  @xcite ) with the two - dimensional finite - difference frequency - domain method on cartesian and polar grids . in figure",

    "standard ( ` polar - axial ' ) and alternative ( ` pure polar ' ) formulations of maxwell s equations were presented in . in most cases , as illustrated in , both approaches yield equivalent description of electromagnetics phenomena . in",
    "we pointed however that it is the ` pure polar ' formalism that complies with the pml method used with much success in computational electrodynamics .",
    "an interesting question is , to which extent can the classic electric and magnetic fields   whose parity is a matter of controversy   be associated with the ` electric @xmath92-pole ' and ` magnetic @xmath92-pole ' photon states of different parity in quantum electrodynamics ?"
