    "it follows that the quantizer and dequantizer operators of such sets satisfy the condition @xmath24    for some special set of dequantizers the symbols are called the wigner function @xcite .",

    "in this section we consider the general properties of minimal sets of quantizers and dequantizers for @xmath1-dimensional systems .",
    "let us analyse first a two - dimensional qubit system . for this system the minimal set of dequantizers",
    "consists of four linearly independent operators @xmath25 that can be represented by four matrices @xmath26    first we address the problem of determining the four corresponding quantizers @xmath27 satisfying eq .   that can be written using the notations of eqs .   and",
    "as @xmath28 we assume that the dequantizers @xmath29 are known .",
    "let us introduce the operator @xmath30 built up from the elements of the four dequantizer operators and the operator @xmath31 containing the elements of the four quantizer operators .",

    "for example the elements of the quantizer @xmath41 can be expressed as @xmath42    in the following we examine the problem of finding different minimal sets of dequantizers @xmath25 and quantizers @xmath43 .",
    "given a set of @xmath33-s , one can derive another set @xmath44 of dequantizers by applying a non - degenerate linear transformation @xmath45 : @xmath46 denoting the corresponding set of quantizers by @xmath47 the novel sets will satisfy the relation , that is , @xmath48 the operators @xmath47 can be viewed as linear combinations of the previous quantizers @xmath49 , and thus written as @xmath50 substituting and into the following matrix equation can be obtained for the four - dimensional @xmath51 and @xmath52 matrices @xmath53 similarly to the case of eq .  , this equation leads to four systems of equations each of which contains four linear equations in the form @xmath54 solving these equations the matrix @xmath55 can be written in the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the cofactor matrix of @xmath45 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "that if @xmath45 is non - degenerate then @xmath55 is non - degenerate , too ( @xmath58 ) .    in conclusion , knowing a minimal set of dequantizers one can derive other sets by using eq .",

    "an additional proposition can be deduced . in this expression",

    "it means that the quantizers are hermitian , too .",
    "let us consider the case when the dequantizers are orthogonal to each other , that is , @xmath62 hence , the operators @xmath33 form an orthogonal basis in the space of operators acting on the vectors of the hilbert space of qubits . comparing eqs .",
    "and for a fixed set of dequantizers @xmath33 it is obvious that the choice @xmath63 is the solution of eq .",
    ", that is , the corresponding quantizers @xmath49 coincide with dequantizers @xmath25 .",
    "evidently , they are orthogonal to each other , that is , @xmath64 .",
    "so the quantizers @xmath33 and dequantizers @xmath35 form a self - dual system .",
    "though all these results are formulated for a qubit , they can easily be generalized for a multi - qubit systems of higher dimensions . in @xmath22 dimensions",
    "the operators @xmath4 and @xmath15 corresponding to the operators eqs .   and , respectively , can be defined by @xmath65 matrices .",

    "the transformation rules for @xmath33 and @xmath35 can be easily generalized and all the previously discussed properties of these operators remain valid for higher dimensions .",
    "in this section we consider a qubit system and analyse in detail the case when the minimal sets of dequantizers and quantizers coincide with each other , that is , they form a self - dual system and these operators are hermitian .",
    "let us take four general hermitian operators @xmath66 where the parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are real . our aim is to find explicitly the matrix elements of the operators @xmath25 so that these matrices obey eq .  .",
    "from this equation one can derive ten algebraic equations for the 16 parameters of the operators in . for different matrices ,",
    "that is , @xmath71 we get the following six expressions : @xmath72 and for @xmath73 we have four equations : @xmath74 the parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 in the operator @xmath79 can be chosen arbitrarily , for example , @xmath80 then from eq .",
    "we get @xmath81 and the equations @xmath82 and eqs .   for @xmath83 ,",
    "that is , six equations can be used for determining the nine remaining unknown parameters .",
    "one can obtain three different solutions of these equations depending on how many of the parameters @xmath84 are allowed to be zero . in the following the corresponding operator sets",
    "are denoted by @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "these solutions can be characterized by the number of freely chosen parameters .",
    "let us assume that @xmath88 we introduce the notation @xmath89 from eqs .",
    "and it is clear that @xmath90 and @xmath91 in this notation the solution of the equations is @xmath92 and the corresponding operators @xmath93 take the form @xmath94 for the normalization equations we get @xmath95 these equations contain six parameters , hence , three of them can be chosen freely within certain constraints ensuring that the equations have real solutions satisfying the condition in eq .  .",
    "+ the general form of the solutions of eqs .   is complicated and depends on the three chosen independent parameters . without presenting here these expressions explicitly we present one set of dequantizer operators corresponding to the general form in eq .  :",
    "@xmath96    next , let us apply the conditions @xmath97 in this case the equation reads @xmath98 let us choose the parameters @xmath99 to be the independent ones in these equations .",
