    "consider a piece of conductive material whose resistivity possesses some microscopic disorder .",
    "one way to account for this disorder is to suppose that the material is an electric network made of tiny random resistances .",
    "once this model is assumed , one typically wants to understand the behaviour of the macroscopic resistivity of the material . to make the picture more accurate ,",
    "imagine that each edge of the lattice @xmath1 is equipped with a resistance @xmath2 belonging to some interval @xmath3 $ ] ( we shall not precise any resistance unit ) .",
    "suppose in addition that all resistances are random , independently and identically distributed .",
    "our macroscopic piece of material is now the box @xmath4 , two sides of which we distinguish : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the _ effective resistance _ of the box @xmath7 is then defined as : @xmath8 where the sum is over the set @xmath9 of the edges inside @xmath7 and the infimum is taken over all unit flows on @xmath9 from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( all the precise definitions are postponed until section [ sec : prel ] ) . in the litterature , the _ effective conductivity _ is more often the main character .",
    "it is simply the inverse of the effective resistance and can also be defined as : @xmath12 where the infimum is over all functions @xmath13 on @xmath7 having value @xmath14 on @xmath10 and @xmath15 on @xmath11 , @xmath16 is the conductance of edge @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the difference of @xmath13 along edge @xmath17 .",
    "the unique minimizer in the definition of @xmath19 is the function having value @xmath14 on @xmath10 and @xmath15 on @xmath11 being discrete harmonic on @xmath20 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the setting above is also relevant to describe the pressure field of a fluid through a weakly porous medium when the circulation of the fluid can be modelled with poiseuille s law .",
    "the central problem is now to understand the asymptotic probabilistic behaviour of @xmath21 ( or , equivalently , of @xmath19 ) as @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "the first step in this direction was accomplished in the setting of stochastic homogenization theory ( cf .",
    "@xcite , chapter  7 ) . it is shown in @xcite , section 3 , that a law of large numbers holds ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for related results ) .",
    "namely , there is some positive constant @xmath22 such that : @xmath23{a.s}\\mu\\quad \\mbox { i.e } \\quad n^{d-2}{\\mathcal{r}}_n\\xrightarrow[n\\to\\infty]{a.s}\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\;.\\ ] ] to understand the scaling , notice that the function @xmath24 gives an upperbound of order @xmath25 on the value of @xmath19 , and the nash - williams inequality , a standard result in the theory of electrical networks cf .",
    "@xcite , shows that this order is the right one .",
    "a second step is to understand the fluctuations of @xmath19 and @xmath21 .",
    "if the optimal function in the definition of @xmath19 was @xmath26 , then @xmath19 would merely be a sum of @xmath27 i.i.d random variables , each of variance @xmath28 .",
    "the variance of @xmath19 would thus be of order @xmath29 , and that of @xmath21 of order @xmath30 .",
    "a lower bound of this order was given by wehr , cf .",
    "@xcite , under some technical assumptions ( see also section  [ sec : lowlevels ] below ) .",
    "more recently , an upper bound of the same order was obtained by @xcite for a different , but closely related quantity .",
    "we shall present in more details the work of gloria and otto at the end of this introduction .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to derive the right order of the variances of @xmath19 and @xmath21 and in addition to make a step further in the understanding of their fluctuations by deriving gaussian central limit theorems for these quantities .",
    "however , for technical reasons we shall only be able to do this in a translation invariant setting , namely for the effective resistance through the torus , cf .",
    "theorem  [ theo : clttorus ] .",
    "this is the main result of the paper .",
    "our approach to obtain this result is however quite general and not restricted to graphs like @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , we shall study in section  [ sec : es ] _ the generalized walsh decomposition _ of point - to - point effective resistance on general infinite networks .",
    "this decomposition , sometimes called the efron - stein decomposition , is an extension of the fourier - walsh decomposition on the discrete cube and is related to a notion of noise sensitivity introduced in @xcite . from now on we shall drop the term `` generalized '' for simplicity . the walsh decomposition of a square integrable function @xmath31 of the resistances reads : @xmath32 where the sum runs over all finite subsets of the set of edges , @xmath33 is a function of @xmath34 for any @xmath35 and @xmath33 is orthogonal to @xmath36 as soon as @xmath37 .",
    "our first result , theorem  [ theo : estight ] , states that the walsh decomposition of the effective resistance is always concentrated on low levels , i.e on sets of bounded cardinality .",
    "it implies that effective resistances are always uniformly stable to noise in the sense of @xcite , cf .",
    "corollary  [ coro : noise ] , and also that the famous efron - stein inequality is always sharp for estimating the variance of the effective resistance , cf .",
    "corollary  [ coro : estight ] .",
    "then , we shall improve this result on a class of graphs which possess some homogeneity property .",
    "these graphs , that we shall qualify as having _ homogeneous currents _ contain all quasi - transitive graphs , cf . corollary  [ coro : transitivehomogeneous ] . on those graphs",
    "we shall show that the walsh decomposition is concentrated on sets of small diameter .",
    "this is the key to obtain a central limit theorem since the sets of resistances with bounded diameter exhibit only local dependence , cf .",
    "section  [ sec : tlc ] .    in section  [ sec : tori ] , we shall adapt this general approach to the effective resistance through the discrete torus , deriving the optimal variance estimate and the gaussian central limit theorem already mentioned .",
    "we end this introduction by giving more details on the work @xcite , and comparing our results to theirs .",
    "their work is close to the homogenization theory framework .",
    "consider the discrete elliptic differential operator @xmath38 corresponding to random , translation invariant and ergodic conductances @xmath39 on @xmath1 .",
    "precise definitions of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given in section  [ sec : prel_current ] , but let us just mention that it gives , for a function @xmath13 on @xmath1 : @xmath42 then , using the words of @xcite , homogenization theory ( namely @xcite ) shows that there exists a constant matrix @xmath43 such that the solution operator of @xmath44 describes the large scale behaviour of the solutions operator of @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath43 can be characterized by the so called corrector : for any @xmath45 in @xmath46 , there exists a unique function @xmath47 on @xmath1 ( which is a function also of the conductances ) such that @xmath48 is stationnary , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and such that @xmath51 is discrete harmonic for @xmath38 on @xmath1 .",
    "then , @xmath43 is characterized by : @xmath52\\;.\\ ] ] when the conductances are i.i.d , @xmath43 equals @xmath22 times the identity matrix , and the constant @xmath22 is the same as in the law of large numbers of @xmath19 stated above .",
    "we shall fix @xmath53 in the sequel .",
    "when one is interested in computing @xmath22 , gloria and otto remark that the preceding characterization is useless .",
    "thus , one has to find a way to efficiently _ estimate _ @xmath22 .",
    "the quantity @xmath54 is therefore a reasonable estimator for @xmath22 , and this is where the knowledge of its variance , and even of a central limit theorem , may be useful . as gloria and otto remark for ( a quantity very similar to )",
    "@xmath19 is that it lacks stationnarity , which is `` a handicap for error analysis '' .",
    "next they introduce a stationary approximation of the voltage , namely @xmath55 solving : @xmath56 let @xmath57 be an averaging cutoff function with support in @xmath58 ( and some extra regularity condition ) . when @xmath59 is large with respect ro @xmath0",
    ", they show that the quantity : @xmath60 is a good proxy for @xmath61 , and furthermore , they show that the variance of @xmath62 is of order at most @xmath63 , with some extra polylogarithmic factor in @xmath59 for @xmath64 .",
    "this order coincides with the variance order conjectured above for @xmath61 .",
    "what we shall obtain in theorem  [ theo : clttorus ] is an optimal variance estimate and a central limit theorem for the effective conductance on the discrete torus of length @xmath0 when @xmath0 goes to infinity . to compare our results to those obtained by gloria and otto",
    ", we shall say that the precise quantity that we analyse is practically computable and stationary .",
    "furthermore , in some sense , the discrete tori converge to @xmath1 better than the discrete cubes since they avoid boundary effects .",
    "thus , the effective conductance on the torus may be a better estimator of @xmath22 , even if i do not prove in the present paper that it converges ( once normalized ) to @xmath22 .",
    "this was not the goal of my paper and will be the purpose of a future work .",
    "secondly , our method works the same way whether @xmath64 or not , and this is an advantage over gloria and otto s result , which makes a distinction between the two .",
    "finally , the fact that we obtain a central limit theorem is really a step further compared to @xcite which only obtain variance estimates . on the other side , gloria and otto obtain other interesting results , that we do not get by our method , notably concerning the integrability of the corrector itself ( proposition  2.1 in @xcite ) .",
