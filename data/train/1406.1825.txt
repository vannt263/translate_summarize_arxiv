    "as an excellent tool to study the structure of stars , asteroseismology has been developed rapidly in recent decades . by investigating stellar oscillations , it enables us to probe the interior of stars . for solar - like stars , there are two main pulsation modes confined inside them : p modes and g modes . for the p modes , pressure is the restoring force and they are primarily vertical acoustic waves . for the g modes , buoyancy is the restoring force .",
    "p - mode oscillations are widely observed in main - sequence stars because of their large amplitudes and their motions are primarily vertical .",
    "however , although g - mode oscillations have much smaller amplitudes , which make them very hard to be observed directly , they are seen in terms of mixed modes in some more evolved stars .    in main - sequence stars , p modes and g modes are trapped in their own cavities . when stars evolve to the giant stage , the very large gravitational acceleration in the core opens up the possibility that the two cavities could couple with each other , making these coupled modes have p - mode character in the outer part of stars and g - mode character in the core area , for which they are called _ mixed modes_. thanks to the high quality of the photometry data from _ kepler _  and _ corot _ , many recent analyses of oscillations in red giant ( rg ) stars have been done ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which prove that using mixed modes is a robust tool to probe the inner structure and evolution of these evolved stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the general properties of stellar non - radial oscillations analytically using an asymptotic method and obtained eigenvalue conditions for p modes , g modes as well as mixed modes . @xcite also analysed the properties of the modes using an approximation to the asymptotic relations . in this paper , we introduce the typical properties of mixed modes and use models to predict the behaviour of these modes .",
    "when stars evolve to post - main - sequence stages , the large gravitational acceleration in the core increases the upper limit of the frequency range that g modes can reach , which results in the coupling of p modes and g modes . as a result , these coupled modes undergo so - called _ avoided crossing _ and _ mode bumping _ , their frequencies being shifted from the regular spacings indicated by the asymptotic descriptions . with the intention of asymptotic analysis , we follow a 1.3 @xmath1 rg model with initial solar parameters that was calculated by the astec evolution code @xcite and the adipls oscillation package @xcite .",
    "its evolutionary track is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fg : track ] .",
    "several different cases of mixed modes will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the frequencies of low - degree and high - order p modes are regularly spaced , approximately following the asymptotic relation @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the radial order , @xmath4 is the angular degree of the mode and @xmath5 is the angular frequency .",
    "@xmath6 is known as the large frequency separation , which is the inverse sound travel time across the star , given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the sound speed and _ r _ is the surface radius , and the integration is made over the distance @xmath9 to the centre . in equation",
    ", @xmath10 is a frequency - dependent phase shift due to the large gradient of the cut - off frequency near the stellar surface and @xmath11 is a correction called the small separation . on the other hand ,",
    "the periods of g modes satisfy an asymptotic relation @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is again a phase shift , and @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the brunt - visl frequency ( or buoyancy frequency ) and the integral is over the cavity where the g mode is trapped .",
    "however , the asymptotic relations for both p and g modes are only valid for high - order modes ( @xmath17 )",
    ".    the oscillation displacement @xmath18 can be separated into radial and horizontal components , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a unit vector directed outward .",
    "@xcite introduced two variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 related to the displacement components as @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the density . neglecting the perturbation to the gravitational potential ( the so - called cowling approximation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the two variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 each approximately satisfy a second - order differential equation that describes the behaviour of oscillations , @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 here @xmath32 is approximated by ignoring the acoustic cut - off frequency term that is generally small in the stellar interior and large near the surface . in equations   and  ,",
    "apart from @xmath16 there is another characteristic frequency @xmath33 , also known as the lamb frequency , @xmath34 @xcite solved the set of differential equations   and asymptotically to obtain @xmath23 and @xmath24 using the jwkb method ( or jeffreys , wentzel , kramers and brillouin ; @xcite ) and found that there is a general eigenvalue conditions for p and g modes , @xmath35 here @xmath3 is the mode order , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are adjacent turning points ( where @xmath38 ) , between which @xmath32 is positive .",
    "again @xmath39 is a phase correction that depends on the structure of the model near the turning points .",
    "the dependence of @xmath39 on frequencies is implied in the definition of @xmath30 , which can be explored numerically by using equation   @xcite .",
    "we note that the derivations of equations ( [ eq : difv ] ) and ( [ eq : difw ] ) neglected terms that may lead to singularities at critical points in the model , although typically in _ evanescent _ regions where @xmath40 .",
    "this is explicit in a second - order equation , exact in the cowling approximation , presented by @xcite , which is of the same form as equations ( [ eq : difv ] ) and ( [ eq : difw ] ) but expressed in terms of a different dependent variable .",
    ".fundamental parameters of the 1.30 @xmath1 giant models .",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are surface radius and luminosity , provided in units of the solar values , @xmath43 is effective temperature , @xmath44 is the estimated frequency at maximum power and @xmath45 is the corresponding radial - mode order , @xmath46 is the acoustic - mode frequency spacing obtained from fitting the frequencies and @xmath47 was determined from the asymptotic integral , equation  ( [ eq : dnu ] ) , and @xmath48 is the asymptotic period spacing of dipolar modes ( cf . equation  [ eq : dp ] ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have analysed the properties of the dipolar mixed modes ( @xmath0 ) of rg models .",
    "mixed modes result from the coupling between the acoustic and gravity modes in evolved stars when the buoyancy frequency @xmath16 is high enough that frequencies of g modes are able to approach those of p modes .",
    "when a star evolves past the main sequence , the possible frequency upper limit that a g mode can get to increases dramatically because of the increase of the central density . in the beginning , oscillation modes are dominated by p modes and coupled with several g modes , and high - order pure g modes are only distributed over the low frequency region .",
    "frequencies of p modes are bumped up to a slightly higher value when an avoided crossing happens . as the star ages , frequencies of more g modes grow to be as high as those of p modes .",
    "the dense g modes are then coupled with a few acoustic oscillation modes .",
    "the frequencies of g modes are diminished a little as a result of coupling in this case .",
    "the extent of the coupling can be measured by a coefficient called the coupling strength @xmath49 that corresponds to how close the g and p cavities are .",
    "the closer the two cavities are , the larger is @xmath49 .",
    "the coupling actually affects every oscillation mode all the time in more evolved stars , at a level which also depends on the mode phases .",
    "@xcite show an asymptotic relation of mixed modes derived from an implicit relation between the phases of coupled p and g modes . by using this asymptotic relation , we can measure the coupling strength and @xmath50 to a very good degree for ascending - branch models by means of grid searching .",
    "in other words , the asymptotic relation is very helpful for the identification of mixed modes in observed power spectra .",
    "however , our fitting method failed to provide reasonable @xmath49 for early models where p modes still play the leading role .",
    "the fact that our grid searching only finds the best parameters without giving any uncertainties can be overcome with a more detail grid .",
    "it is well known that mixed modes have both p and g mode characters simultaneously , but at a different level .",
    "we find that for rg models when a mixed mode has considerable variation in frequency , the proportions of the contributions to its mode inertia from the outer region to the central core change significantly as well . frequencies of those p - m modes with a large contribution ratio of mode inertia between the two regions ( @xmath51 ) are very close to the pure p modes , which are obvious in the power spectrum . in their vicinities , several mixed modes with relatively smaller @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) can be detected from observation , which have more g - cavity character and hence reveal more information of the central core .",
    "@xcite estimated that the chance of finding such mixed modes is related to the width of the maximum reduction in period spacings , which is based on a study of the solutions of an asymptotic dispersion relation .",
    "although we have a slightly different dispersion relation in this paper , an identical expression for the period spacing is obtained and has been employed to fit theoretical models , which gives excellent results for @xmath50 and @xmath6 .",
    "we confirm the prediction of @xcite about the chance of finding mixed modes , but we also notice that the width and depth of the dips in period spacing depend on the combination of mode frequency and @xmath49 .",
    "our fitting to period spacing is able to supply uncertainties and also results in a good outcome of @xmath49 for more evolved stars , but unreasonably high value of @xmath49 for high - order g modes .",
    "the two fitting approaches can both provide robust outcomes for evolved stars when they are combined .",
    "we note that , although our analysis is done for theoretical models , the method is also useful for real observations that provide adequate mixed modes .",
    "the value of @xmath49 inferred from the analysis of observed frequencies in principle provides diagnostics of the stellar interior , supplementing @xmath46 and @xmath50 which probe , respectively , the envelope and the core of the star .",
    "this requires a better understanding of how @xmath49 is related to the structure of the star in the evanescent region .",
    "the theoretical @xmath54 from the integral expression of equation   is obviously inadequate for this purpose , given the problems with the underlying asymptotic equation in the evanescent region .",
    "a more careful analysis is required , taking into account the potential singularities .",
    "a second limitation in the analysis is the use of the cowling approximation , neglecting the perturbation to the gravitational potential .",
    "we have tested the importance of this by determining the coupling strength computed by fitting frequencies computed in the cowling approximation , comparing with results based on the full set of equations , and showing a significant reduction in @xmath49 , by about 0.02 .",
    "we note that the cowling approximation could be avoided in the present case of dipolar modes by using the exact second - order equation developed by @xcite .",
    "this definitely deserves further investigation .",
