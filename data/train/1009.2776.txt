    "now we consider the pure collinear part of the matrix element , i.e. , the one after the zero - bin contribution is subtracted .",
    "the fundamental observation is that for @xmath45 and pv prescriptions , the zero - bin subtraction cancels completely all the dependence on the ir parameter @xmath61 leaving us with the result of feynman gauge ( see the appendix for the zero - bin contributions ) . in other words",
    "the zero - bin is responsible of canceling all prescription and ir - regulator dependence in the case of the @xmath45 , pv prescriptions .",
    "thus we see that at least at one loop one does not really need to introduce the @xmath0-wilson line in those prescriptions ( altough it is certainly possible to define a matrix element and its zero - bin subtraction both and separately gauge invariant with the use of @xmath0 ) .",
    "however as we established in the previous section this is not the case in the ml prescription which is the only one reliably consistent with the quantization of qcd in light - cone gauge .",
    "until now we have considered the contribution from the @xmath0-wilson line in one collinear direction however in many applications of scet there are more than one collinear direction . to make the discussion more concrete",
    "let us consider the quark form factor both in full qcd and in scet . in full qcd",
    "it is well - know that the electromagnetic current @xmath62 is a conserved quantity and is gauge invariant under arbitrary @xmath63 gauge transformation . in scet",
    "it has been established by different authors  @xcite that the full qcd quark form factor @xmath64 factorizes into an incoming jet , outgoing jet and a soft function built out of two soft wilson lines .",
    "however all those treatments were actually performed in feynman gauge and not in light - cone gauge .",
    "the calculation in scet in light - cone gauge can now be performed with the @xmath0-wilson line that enters into both jets and one needs to introduce two light - cone gauge fixing conditions for each collinear jet ( or collinear lagrangian ) and two different @xmath0 wilson lines again for each collinear direction , say @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( and/or their hermitian conjugates . ) with these two transverse wilson lines each of the two jets becomes gauge invariant in both regular and singular gauges . thus using @xmath0 s the factorization of the full qcd quark form factor established in covariant gauges carries through straightforwardly also in light - cone gauge .    as we mentioned",
    "before the practical importance of the @xmath0-wilson lines in scet is that it allows us to write a gauge invariant definitions of the non - perturbative matrix elements appearing in the factorization theorems for certain cross - sections where fields are separated in the transverse direction .    as an example we take the tmdpdf in qcd and in scet . in qcd",
    "the gauge invariant definition was first given in ref .",
    "@xcite and studied in light - cone gauge in ref .",
    "@xcite . in all these works",
    "it is pointed out how in qcd new kind of divergences appear when the fields entering the matrix elements are separated in the transverse direction .",
    "the tmdpdf occur for instance in sidis and here the complete factorization is achieved only in the presence of transverse links . in particular in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown how to use light - cone gauge for practical calculations in sidis .",
    "within scet the tmdpdf for a quark @xmath67 in a hadron @xmath68 with momentum @xmath69 can be defined with the use of @xmath70-field @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the momentum fraction of the quark in the light - cone direction , and @xmath73 is the usual label operators in scet .",
    "the above definition of the tmdpdf is now gauge invariant in both classes of gauges .",
    "the complete analysis of tmdpdf in scet and its application to sidis and other semi - inclusive processes will be developed in a forthcoming work  @xcite .    the above analysis of the tmdpdf can be straightforwardly extended to consider the non - perturbative matrix elements introduced in  @xcite where one needs to invoke the @xmath0-wilson line in the operator definition to obtain gauge invariant matrix elements as they should be . a final comment concerns the use of prescriptions in qcd . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that the only prescription that allows the quantization of qcd is the ml prescription . however in scet we are considering just the fock space of collinear particles and not the whole fock space of qcd .",
    "the fact that we are considering a restriction of the whole fock space implies that we have to re - discuss the quantization of the theory in this particular subspace  @xcite with the help of scet .",
    "moreover in ref .",
    "@xcite the role of the @xmath0-wilson line was not discussed . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors use scet in light - cone gauge and find that their calculation can not give the correct result in the ml prescription ( so contradicting the results of ref .",
    "we think that the inclusion of the @xmath0-wilson line would reconcile the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite with the ml prescription  @xcite .    to conclude",
    "we have shown that the introduction of the @xmath0-wilson line in scet is mandatory to achieve gauge invariant matrix elements both in covariant as well as in singular gauges .",
    "we explicitly performed one loop calculation for the scet fundamental quantity @xmath16 in both feynman and light - cone gauges and showed that in the ml prescription the @xmath0-wilson line must be introduced to obtain gauge invariance .",
    "in other prescriptions commonly used in light - cone gauge , the soft or zero - bin subtractions remove the prescription dependence thus the purely collinear scet matrix elements are gauge invariant in those prescriptions .",
    "however as we mentioned earlier such prescriptions may not lead to a proper quantization of scet as it is the case in qcd .",
    "the introduction of the @xmath0-wilson line allows scet to properly define in a gauge invariant way non - perturbative matrix elements such as the tmdpdf and generalizations thereof .",

    "<S> the success of scet to factorize high - energy processes ( and thereby allowing resummation of large logarithms ) rests mainly on two factors . </S>",

    "<S> essentially , is the most important step in establishing factorization theorems since it allows for an operator definition of the non - perturbative hadronic matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> the second factor is the _ gauge invariant _ building - blocks of scet which render the previous operator definitions gauge invariant as they should be . in scet </S>",
    "<S> there are two fundamental quantities with which hadronic matrix elements can be defined . in the quark - gluon collinear sector </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath1 and @xmath2 for gluon - gluon collinear interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that those quantities are gauge invariant ( under collinear and soft gauge transformations ) as long as the gauge transformation is unity at infinity ( in other words @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gauge transformation matrix . ) </S>",
    "<S> this is the case in covariant gauges .    </S>",
    "<S> the covariant gauge is `` regular '' in the sense that all components of the gluon field @xmath5 vanish at light - cone infinity while for `` singular '' gauge , certain components do not . </S>",
    "<S> actually one can show that in qed in light - cone gauge we have the following @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electric charge , @xmath8 is a light - cone coordinate and @xmath9 is the distance in the transverse direction . </S>",

    "<S> the fact that in light - cone gauge @xmath11 does not vanish at @xmath12 ( unlike the case in covariant gauge ) will have a rather very important impact on the `` gauge invariant '' scet matrix elements as we shall see below . </S>",
    "<S> the basic observation is that in singular gauges a gauge transformation at infinity in light - cone direction , can be applied on the quark field which has to be , as usual , compensated for by a wilson line . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this simple observation is that in light cone gauge one is enforced to introduce a new wilson lines , built only from the transverse components @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we will call these wilson lines @xmath14 as they contain only the transverse components of the gluon field . </S>",

    "<S> this function enters the factorization theorem of the semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) processes , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scet version of the tmdpdf , built only from the collinear quark field and the collinear wilson line , is not gauge invariant . </S>",
    "<S> as such the scet tmdpdf is not really a genuine physical quantity . </S>",
    "<S> however when the contribution from the @xmath0-wilson line is taken into account it becomes gauge invariant in both classes of gauges : regular and singular ones . </S>",
    "<S> more discussion on this will be given below and in a forthcoming paper  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an important piece of discussion in light - cone gauge concerns the type of prescription to be used in the gluon propagator . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was shown that the canonical quantization of qcd in light - cone gauge is consistent only with the mandelstam - leibbrandt ( ml ) prescription . </S>",
    "<S> this prescription is the only one which respects causality , unitarity , qcd power counting and allows for wick rotations in loop integrals . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , this prescription must be taken as the reference prescription also in scet . </S>",
    "<S> the use of a particular prescription is related to the regularization of infrared ( ir ) divergences , as the prescription regulates essentially infrared singularities . </S>",
