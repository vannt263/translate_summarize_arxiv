    "since the first discoveries of distant submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ; @xcite ) , tremendous progress has been made in understanding their nature and their role in galaxy evolution . with single - dish submillimeter surveys ,",
    "we are now able to resolve approximately 30% of the 850  @xmath2 m background into point sources with @xmath3 mjy and constrain their number counts fairly well at this bright end ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the low resolution of single - dish telescopes and the associated large positional uncertainties make the identification and followup of these sources quite difficult .",
    "roughly 60%70% of bright smgs have counterparts in deep radio interferometric images @xcite and their positions are known with subarcsec accuracy .",
    "spectroscopic followup of the radio identified smgs shows a redshift distribution between @xmath43.5 and that the smgs dominate the total star formation in this redshift range @xcite .",
    "the recent advent of the submillimeter array ( sma ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) further helps to identify the radio - faint smgs , and the redshift distribution has been extended to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the redshift identifications , detailed followup observations have been made to study the properties of the smgs in the x - ray , near - infrared , mid - infrared , and molecular line transitions ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter a03 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the followup studies of smgs have been overwhelmingly focused on the brighter sources ( @xmath6  mjy ) , which can be easily detected by single - dish telescopes .",
    "the nature of fainter smgs that comprise the bulk of the submillimeter background has been much less explored .",
    "surveys of lensing cluster fields yield small samples of sub - mjy sources @xcite .",
    "the number counts indicate that the background is dominated by sources with @xmath7  mjy and that the full resolution of the background requires detections of @xmath8  mjy sources . stacking analyses",
    "statistically detect faint smgs at 500 @xmath2 m to 1.2  mm , and various attempts have been made to study the redshift distribution of these faint smgs ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2006 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the results from these stacking analyses have not converged to a consistent picture .",
    "a full understanding of the submillimeter background population will likely require next - generation interferometers , such as the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "fortunately , it is now possible to detect more typical submillimeter sources with the sma .",
    "the recent upgrade of the sma to a 4  ghz bandwidth not only greatly boosts its continuum sensitivity , but it also makes the calibrations with fainter quasars easier than before .",
    "this provides a first glance of what we may find in deep alma surveys and what issues may be present in current studies of smgs . in this letter",
    "we report new sma 340  ghz continuum observations of two smgs , goods  850 - 11 and goods  850 - 13 ( @xcite , hereafter w04 ) , aka .",

    "interestingly , both single - dish sources are resolved by the sma into multiple physically unrelated galaxies . to our knowledge , these are the first examples of resolved , unrelated , multiple sources in the smg population .",
    "the sma observations of goods  850 - 11 and 13 were carried out on 2009 december 30 and 31 , respectively .",
    "seven of the eight sma antennas were available in the compact configuration .",
    "two sidebands of 4 ghz each were centered at 334 and 346  ghz .",
    "titan was observed to provide flux calibration .",
    "the bright radio source 3c 273 was observed to provide passband calibration .",
    "quasars 0958 + 655 and 1642 + 689 , which are 17.4 and 25.1  degree from goods - n , respectively , were observed every 15  minutes for complex gain calibrations .",
    "the 225  ghz opacity was excellent , @xmath90.05 the first night and @xmath100.07 the second night .",
    "the averaged single - sideband system temperature was 380  k on both nights .",
    "the effective integration was @xmath11 and 7.2  hour per antenna on goods  850 - 11 and 13 , respectively .",
    "the calibration and data inspection were performed with the idl - based caltech package mir modified for the sma .",
    "continuum data were generated by averaging the spectral channels after the passband phase calibration .",
    "both gain calibrators were used to derive gain curves . however , we compared the results made with just adopting one calibrator for consistency checks , and we did not find a systematic difference .",
    "flux calibrations were performed using data taken under conditions ( time , hour angle , and elevation ) similar to that of the flux calibrator .",
    "the flux calibration error is typically within @xmath12 with this method .",
    "the calibrated interferometric visibility data were exported to the package miriad for subsequent imaging and analysis .",
    "the visibility data were weighted inversely proportional to the system temperature and fourier transformed to form images .",
    "the `` robust weighting '' of @xcite was also applied , with a robust parameter of 1.0 , to obtain a better balance between beam size and s / n .",
    "the images were cleaned around detected sources to approximately @xmath13 the noise level to remove the effects of the sidelobes .",
    "the noises measured from the cleaned images are 0.72 and 0.68  mjy for the images of goods  850 - 11 and 13 , respectively .",
    "the synthesized beams are @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the images of goods  850 - 11 and 13 , respectively . the images were corrected for the sma primary beam response .",

    "source positions and fluxes were measured by fitting the image with point - source models using the miriad imfit routine .",

    "thus , the coincidence with the 3.6  @xmath2 m source makes this detection much more secure .",
    "we therefore conclude that goods  850 - 13a is a real detection .",
    "in w04 we noticed an elongated morphology in our scuba image , and our source extraction assigned the flux to two sources : goods  850 - 13 with @xmath50  mjy and 850 - 23 with @xmath51  mjy .",

    "* ) or for morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is the first time that the sma has discovered new smgs .",
    "the multiple sma detections illustrate the limitations of identifying smgs in any wavelength other than the submillimeter itself .",
    "both sources had radio , 24 @xmath2 m , and x - ray identifications in p06 and a03 .",
    "all of the previously proposed identifications are only partially correct ; i.e. , they are all legitimate smgs , but the submillimeter fluxes and source numbers will be misinterpreted by up to a factor of 3 . if such cases are common , then our understanding of the smg population is fundamentally flawed .",
    "the effects of multiple smgs are commonly included in single - dish number counts simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; w04 ) .",
    "however , its importance ( relative to other effects such as eddington bias ) has not been directly demonstrated by observations .",
    "so far only sensitive millimeter / submillimeter interferometric observations can reveal the existence of multiple smgs like goods  850 - 11 and 13 , since existing single - dish telescopes are still severely confusion limited ( at @xmath54 m ) or noise limited ( at 450  @xmath2 m ) .",
    "the sma surveys of @xcite imaged 15 smgs selected at 1.1 mm .",
    "they did not find evidence of multiple sources , consistent with the argument made by @xcite that multiple sources are rare .",
    "however , the sma surveys of younger et al .  have 345 ghz rms sensitivities of 12 mjy .",
    "even if there are secondary sources with @xmath555 mjy in their survey fields , such sources would not be easily detected .",
    "our sma survey is the first one that is deep enough to reveal such cases .",
    "after the sma upgraded to the 4 ghz bandwidth , we observed five goods - n smgs at similar depths ( a.  barger et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "two of them are resolved into multiple sources and reported here .",
    "there is a third resolved source that will be reported by barger et al .",
    "it is unclear whether this source is a merger or a physically unrelated pair .",
    "even if we exclude the third source , the frequency of multiple sources in our sma sample still seems unusually high . to better understand this",
    ", we performed monte carlo simulations that mimic our scuba and sma surveys .",
    "we first created 1000 simulated scuba images using the differential counts in @xcite and @xcite , the `` true - noise '' map created in our goods - n scuba survey in w04 , and the scuba beam in w04 .",
    "we than extracted the simulated scuba sources .",
    "for each scuba source detected at @xmath1 mjy and @xmath56 ( the selection criteria for our sma observations ) , we searched the input catalog for any @xmath57 mjy ( our sma detection limit ) sources within @xmath58 ( the sma primary beam hwhm ) of the scuba position . in the simulations",
    "the mean number of @xmath1 mjy sources in a w04 scuba area is @xmath59 , where the uncertainty is the dispersion in the 1000 realizations and is nearly poissonian .",
    "this value is consistent with the w04 scuba observations ( 15 sources ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is significantly larger than the cumulative count , as it is affected by blending and flux boosting .",
    "the measured counts take these effects out . the mean numbers of double and triple systems are @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "we had observed 10 of the 15 @xmath1 mjy scuba sources with the sma .",
    "the most recent five of the 10 sma observations were deep enough to detect @xmath57 mjy sources .",
    "the earlier sma observations were shallower , so there was a selection bias against scuba sources with multiple counterpart candidates .",
    "given this bias and to be conservative , we only scale the above values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 by a factor of 10/15 , rather than 5/15 .",
    "we thus expect to find @xmath62 double and @xmath63 triple systems .",
    "the probability of finding one triple system like goods 580 - 13 is only 4% , inconsistent with the actual observations . among the possible explanations , the most likely one is clustering of smgs , which is not included in the simulations",
    "this is plausible because the photometric redshift of goods  850 - 13a has a confidence range ( table  [ tab1 ] ) covering the redshift of 13b or 13c .",
    "this can be tested this with future spectroscopic observations in the near - infrared or in the millimeter .    in the same simulations",
    ", we increased the sma detection limit to 4  mjy , and we found that the probability of multiple systems dramatically decreases to @xmath64 .",
    "this is consistent with the sma survey results of @xcite . by altering the details of the simulations",
    ", we also found that the above results are fairly insensitive to the following scuba and sma observing strategies : ( 1 ) the source extraction ( various detection thresholds ) , ( 2 ) flux measurement in the scuba map ( simple aperture flux vs.  optimally filtered flux using the beam ) , ( 3 ) the shape of the scuba sidelobes ( determined by the secondary chopping ) , and ( 4 ) the decision on where to point the sma ( as long as it is within the scuba positional uncertainty ) .",
    "we can use our simulations to predict the early results of alma identifications of scuba sources .",
    "we adopt the primary beam hwhm of @xmath65 of alma at 340  ghz . in the alma",
    "early science phase we expect to have at least 10 antennae , and we can detect 0.5  mjy sources in roughly one hour .",
    "if we point alma at a @xmath1  mjy scuba source , the probabilities of detecting double and triple smgs within the primary beam will be 29% and 6.5% , respectively .",
    "the combined fraction of @xmath66 is very high .",
    "we therefore predict that multiple detections in early alma observations will be quite common .    at the beginning of this section",
    ", we raised the issue about incomplete identifications of smgs in the x - ray , 24  @xmath2 m , and radio .",
    "based on our sma observations and the above simulations , we believe that multiple systems and therefore incomplete identifications are common .",
    "thus , we suggest that large numbers of single - dish sources should be re - identified with sensitive interferometric observations , even if the sources were previously thought to be securely identified .",

    "<S> we carried out extremely sensitive submillimeter array ( sma ) 340 ghz continuum imaging on two submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) : goods  850 - 11 and goods  850 - 13 . </S>",
    "<S> the observations reach sub - mjy rms sensitivities and , interestingly , resolve both sources into multiple , physically unrelated smgs . </S>",
    "<S> goods  850 - 11 is resolved into two sources at different redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> goods  850 - 13 is resolved into three sources , two with different spectroscopic redshifts and one only with a photometric redshift . </S>",
    "<S> all the sma sources have fluxes in the 35  mjy range and all are detected at 1.4  ghz . </S>",
    "<S> three of them are detected by _ </S>",
    "<S> chandra _ , and one is a previously unknown x - ray smg . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time that single - dish smgs are resolved into multiple unrelated sources and also the first time that the sma has discovered new smgs . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that identifications of smgs at any wavelengths other than the submillimeter itself can be misleading , since such identifications usually only pick up one of the real counterparts . using simulations that mimic our scuba and sma observations , we find that the number of triple systems detected in our sma survey is much higher than that expected from the current best - determined number counts . </S>",
    "<S> we tentatively attribute this to clustering . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict that alma will find @xmath0 of @xmath1  mjy 850 @xmath2 m scuba sources to be multiple systems . </S>",
    "<S> based on our sma observations and simulations , we suggest that large samples of existing smgs should be imaged with sensitive interferometric observations , even if the smgs were previously thought to be securely identified . </S>"
