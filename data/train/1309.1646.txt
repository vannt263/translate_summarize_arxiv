    "2001 ; goerdt et al .",
    "2010 ; inoue & saitoh 2011 ) .    in connection with this problem , some studies reported observational universalities of dm halos .",
    "strigari et al . (",
    "2008 ) found there exists a common mass scale among dm halos of nearby dwarf galaxies . according to their analysis based on jeans equation for spherical systems ,",
    "the enclosed dm mass within 300pc from the halo centers , @xmath11 , is @xmath12 ( hereafter , strigari relation ) .",

    "donato et al . ( 2009 ) confirmed this result for a larger sample .",
    "the finding of kormendy & freeman ( 2004 ) is also consistent with the observed correlations of core parameters @xmath14 when fitting the observations by burkert halos as confirmed by salucci et al .",

    "more recently , del popolo et al . ( 2013 ) proposed the theoretical interpretation .",
    "the motivation of this work is to investigate the connection between processes transforming cusps to cores and the universalities of dark halo cores .",
    "the outline of this @xmath16 is as follows . in order to understand the meaning of the universalities in the cosmological context , we start in section 2 with an investigation of the dependence of the dark halo concentration paremeter on halo mass and redshift . in section 3",
    ", we argue the @xmath0 relation and cusp  to  core transformation process are connected .",
    "the results derived in section 3 provide information about halo properties , formation redshift and virial mass .",
    "section 4 demonstrates strigari and the @xmath0 relation for nearby dwarf galaxies are linked that also shows both relations are inconsistent for larger and smaller galaxies .",
    "we summarize the results in section 5 .",
    "the concentration parameter of an nfw halo , @xmath17 , is defined by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the radius inside of which the mean density of the dm halo is 200 times of the critical density of the universe and which is called the virial radius .",
    "this is related to the virial mass , @xmath20 , by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the critical density of the universe and redshift , respectively .",
    "if we know the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath20 and @xmath23 , we can determine the parameters of the nfw halo , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for given @xmath20 and @xmath23 .",
    "such dependence , @xmath24 , has been investigated by using cosmological @xmath3body studies ( e.g. , bullock et al .",
    "2001 ; macci et al .",
    "2008 ) , most of which concluded that @xmath17 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath20 and decreasing @xmath23 .",
    "this is a result of the fact that @xmath17 reflects the cosmic density at the formation ( collapse ) epoch of dm halos . in the standard cdm",
    "cosmology , the cosmic density decreases with time , and present massive objects are believed to have collapsed later than smaller ones .",
    "recently , prada et al . ( 2012 , hearafter p12 ) determined @xmath24 .",
    "according to their results , @xmath17 is described by a nearly universal u  shaped function of @xmath20 , and the dependence on @xmath23 is more complex than proposed by bullock et al .",
    "ludlow et al .",
    "( 2012 ) pointed out halos around the minimum of the u  shaped function are not relaxed dynamically and are in the early period of merger events .",
    "the analysis of p12 and ludlow et al .",
    "( 2012 ) was restricted to @xmath25 . in order to determine @xmath24 on less massive scales , we analysed the data of the cosmological simulation , _ cosmogrid _ , performed by ishiyama et al .",

    "using the fitting formula @xmath36 , we study the connection between the cusp  to  core transformation and the @xmath0 relation and estimate some characteristic properties of dm halos . the procedures and assumptions of the analysis are as follows :    * halo formation : we assume that dm halos form following an nfw profile with the @xmath24 of p12 for given @xmath20 and @xmath23 . + * cusp  to  core transformation : we then assume that nfw halos are transformed into burkert halos by the dynamical process quoted in  1 .    0",
    "we then determine the parameters of the burkert profile into which a given dark halo distribution will transform .",
    "for that we impose two conditions . first , we require mass conservation , that is , @xmath20 is conserved during the cusp  to  core transformation .",
    "secondly , we assume that the density distribution is affected only in the inner regions while the outer density distribution is preserved .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption if this transition is a result of variations in the gravitational potential caused by baryons and stellar feedback . from equations ( [ nfw ] ) and ( [ burkert ] )",
    ", this condition requires @xmath37    we show the results in fig .",
    "[ estimation ] which plots @xmath38 vs. @xmath39 . though spano et al .",
    "( 2008 ) assumed an isothermal sphere to derive the core parameters , the difference between a burkert profile and an isothermal sphere is small if the parameters ( i.e. , the central density and the core radius ) are the same . therefore we adopt the data from spano et al .",

    "such a parameter range , the cooling is efficient so that these objects can cool and condense leading to the active star formation .",
    "most of sample galaxies along the @xmath0 relation lie in these regions .",
    "therefore , we find that the scenario proposed in this study , the cusp  to  core transformation , naturally explains the @xmath0 relation . 0",
    "the second one is the critical virial temperature above which dm halos are able to form visible galaxies , @xmath40 .",
    "figure [ estimation ] also shows that the central density , @xmath39 , is nearly constant for each cusp  to  core transformation redshift , @xmath41 , at which the central cusp has been transformed into core .",
    "we assume that dm halos have survived until now without significant change of the virial mass .",
    "assuming that central cusps have been flattened out into cores by mechanisms which involve star formation activities ( e.g. , ogiya & mori 2011 , 2012 ) , @xmath41 corresponds to the formation epoch of dm halos and galaxies , approximately . as shown in fig .",
    "[ c_parameter ] , the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath20 is weak , especially at high redshifts ( see also fig . 12 in p12 ) . using this and the definition of the virial mass , equation ( [ virial_mass ] ) , @xmath42 should be satisfied .",
    "we have defined the scale density , @xmath6 , by the mass profile of nfw profile , @xmath43 ,   \\label{rhos}\\ ] ] and found @xmath6 is almost independent of @xmath20 .",
    "as one of the results of the anasysis , we know that the core radius of burkert halos , @xmath38 , is close to the scale length of corresponding nfw halos , @xmath7 .",
    "this means that @xmath44 since @xmath39 is determined by equation ( [ outskirt ] ) . combining everything",
    ", one can understand why the dependence of @xmath39 on @xmath38 is fairly weak .",
    "[ estimation ] allows us to estimate @xmath41 from @xmath39 .",
    "as expected , the higher the core density , the higher the transformation redshift of the corresponding halo .",
    "halos with small core radii and correspondingly high core densities have small virial masses while large cores reside in massive dark halos .",
    "burkert ( 1995 ) obtained the density profiles of several dm halos .",
    "his sample halos had core radii of @xmath45 .",
    "1 in burkert ( 1995 ) showed their outer density structures correspond to cdm halos formed at @xmath46 .",
    "he also proposed a scaling relation between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and salucci & burkert ( 2000 ) confirmed this relation for a larger sample .",
    "our results match this relation ( blue box ) .",
    "salvadori et al .",
    "( 2008 ) constructed a semi  analytical model to fit the observed features of the sculptor dsph and found its transformation redshift to be about 7 .",
    "our core property estimate for this formation redshift matches nicely the observational measurements ( large triangle ) .",
    "they also derived the virial mass of the sculptor dsph which is about @xmath47 . using the observationally inferred @xmath38 and transformation redshift , @xmath41 , a halo virial mass of @xmath48 which is a perfect match to their result",
    "is derived .    as demonstrated in this section , the cusp  to ",
    "core transformation naturally generates the @xmath0 relation in the context of the cdm cosmology .",
    "we also find that the cusp  to  core transformation redshift , @xmath41 , is closely related to the central density of cored dm halos .",
    "interestingly , the parameters of the burkert profile ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) are almost the same as the scaling parameters of corresponding nfw halos ( @xmath7 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the observed universal correlation between the core parameters has been shaped by the physics of formation of these dm halos , in other words , the cores of dark halos retain a memory of their formation redshift .",

    "as shown in this panel , the dm halos of dsphs have @xmath12 within 300pc .",
    "this is consistent with strigari relation ( black line ) for lower core radii .",
    "independent of this study , faerman et al . ( 2013 ) show burkert profile naturally produces strigari relation for nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , halos of larger galaxies deviate from it .",
    "our theoretical prediction , shown by the solid red line fits the data very well and indicates that strigari relation is just a coincidence resulting from the fact that dwarf galaxies like close to the maximum of @xmath11 versus @xmath38 correlation . as a result",
    "we would predict that halos that are smaller than those typically found around dsphs should have smaller values of @xmath11 as predicted by strigari relation .",

    ", the horizontal axis corresponds to @xmath7 . comparing the solid and dashed red lines",

    "in this study , we have studied the relation between observational universalities of dark matter halos and the cusp  to  core transformation .",
    "we obtained three interesting results :    * we verified the dependence of the concentration parameter of nfw profiles , @xmath17 , on virial mass of halo , @xmath20 , and redshift , @xmath23 , proposed by prada et al .",
    "( 2012 ) using the data of the cosmological simulation performed by ishiyama et al .",
    "according to our analysis , the @xmath24 proposed by prada et al .",
    "( 2012 ) is appropriate down to @xmath27 which is the mass scale of dwarf galaxies . + * the cusp  to  core transformation shapes the @xmath0 relation naturally .",
    "the central density of the burkert profile , @xmath39 , is almost independent of @xmath20 .",
    "we therefore can estimate the formation epoch of the respective halos from @xmath39 .",
    "our estimations are consistent with previous studies .",
    "the @xmath0 relation is a relict of the formation phase of dm halos and keeps a memory of their time of formation . +",
    "* we found that the @xmath0 and strigari relations are consistent with each other among dm halos surrounding dsphs .",
    "however , this consistency breaks down for halos of more massive galaxies that have larger cores .",
    "the @xmath0 relation can be applied to a broader range of halo mass than strigari relation .",
    "we conclude that strigari relation is an indirect evidence of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "the cusp  to  core transformation represents a viable model in order to explain the origin of these universalities . in our analyses",
    ", we assumed a transformation from nfw profiles to burkert profiles .",
    "this assumption requires some mechanisms to flatten the cusps and to create the cores with sizes comparable to the scale lengths of the cuspy halo .",
    "this requirement might allow to distinguish between different models of core formation and might provide important constraints for them .",
    "it is not only the flattening of a cusp but also the formation of a reasonably sized core that these models have to generate .",
    "an interesting question is whether the cusp  to  core transformation also solves the missing satellite ( e.g. , moore et al .",
    "1999b ) problem .",
    "this might be difficult to achieve as obviously the cores are observed in dwarf galaxies that were not disrupted by internal processes or that became invisible because of quenching of star formation but that still experienced major changes in the gravitational potential leading to cores ( see also pearrubia et al .",
    "in addition , it is also intersting about a weak dependence of a halo mass on the @xmath0 relation ( cardone & tortora 2010 ; boyarsky et al .",
    "2010 ; cardone & del popolo 2012 ) .",
    "the subsequent studies will report on these issues .",
    "it is noteworthy that the transformation redshifts of the sextans and the leo ii dsphs , the leftmost points in fig . 2 ,",
    "are beyond the redshift @xmath53 .",
    "in such an early epoch , the gas is almost metal  free , and @xmath54 acts as a prime coolant ( e.g. , galli & palla 1998 ; omukai & nishi 1998 ; bromm & yoshida 2011 and references therein ) .",
