    "as a significant consequence of various candidates of quantum gravity such as string theory , loop quantum gravity , doubly special relativity and black hole physics , the existence of a minimal observable length and/or a maximal observable momentum is suggested in the literature @xcite . this minimal length is of the order of the planck length @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "based on these theories , the heisenberg uncertainty principle is modified to the so - called generalized ( gravitational ) uncertainty principle ( gup ) @xcite . due to this modification , the hamiltonian of the physical systems will be modified which results in the deformation of the physical properties of these systems in both quantum mechanical and classical levels . in the context of the gup framework ,",
