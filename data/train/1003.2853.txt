    "we now understand the solar neutrino problem  @xcite , i.e. , we now know that the deficit of the electron neutrino flux from the sun can be accounted for approximately as the two flavor neutrino oscillations in matter . from the precise experiments , we know the mixing angle of the neutrino oscillations is large . it is called large mixing angle solution .",
    "historically , the so - called small mixing angle solution has also been discussed  @xcite , because it gave good fit to the solar neutrino data in the past . in this case , the nonadiabatic transitions , which are jumping between the different neutrino energy levels in matter , would become important . on the other hand ,",
    "we also understand now the atmospheric neutrino problem  @xcite , i.e. , the deficit of the muon neutrino flux from the cosmic ray can be explained approximately as the two flavor neutrino oscillations .",
    "we also know the oscillation channel of the atmospheric neutrino differ from the solar neutrino .",
    "these lead us to conclude that the neutrino oscillation is described by three flavor neutrino oscillations .    in the case of the environments with high density , such as supernovae ,",
    "it is important to consider the neutrino oscillations with the three flavor exactly , since there can be two energy level crossings .",
    "furthermore , if nonadiabatic transitions occur at each level crossing at all , then we need to take them into account . in this case , there could be two nonadiabatic transitions  @xcite .",
    "the three flavor neutrino oscillations with two nonadiabatic transitions are very complicated in general .",
    "although little is known about the exact solution of this very complicated problem , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite assumes the independent crossing approximation ( ica ) , which regards two nonadiabatic transitions as independent . in this approximation",
    ", we can regard each nonadiabatic transition locally as that between the two levels , and then we can get the total nonadiabatic transition just by multipling each probability of the nonadiabatic transition  @xcite :    @xmath2 .    the reason that ica has been assumed is ( i ) because the two energy ranges which give a resonance do not overlap for the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters and ( ii ) because the energy of the supernovae neutrino is so low and the solar neutrino mixing angle is so large that we would not have nonadiabatic transitions at both of the energy level crossings .",
    "however , if we have new physics beyond the standard model , then the standard matter effect may be modified  @xcite and it becomes unclear whether these reasonings always hold .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine whether ica holds or not in the three flavor neutrino oscillations , and to discuss under which condition ica breaks down . for simplicity",
    "we take only the three flavor case with the standard matter effect as an example and _ we will assume hypothetical neutrino energy and hypothetical values of the oscillation parameters _ to have nonadiabatic transitions at both energy level crossings .    from numerical calculations , we found that ica breaks down for some range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we found that ica breaks down when the ratio @xmath3 is of order one and the mixing angle @xmath1 is large . in the realistic range of the oscillation parameters ,",
    "since @xmath4 is much larger than one and the mixing angle @xmath1 is small , the two neutrino energy ranges for the resonance never overlap .",
    "this is the reason why the treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite is regarded as correct .",
    "however , it turns out that it is not the correct criterion because we find that two level crossings become independent even if the two resonances overlap . instead of using the notion of the overlapping resonances",
    ", we will introduce the new parameters which gives the criterion of ica . with this criterion of ica",
    ", we interpret the breaking of ica as the sign of a large contribution of the extra off  diagonal coefficients .",
    "our numerical calculations confirm this analytic treatment very well .    although we discuss the simplest case only with the neutrino ",
    "electron interaction in this paper , we can apply our treatment to any other cases even if it is not known whether the nonadiabatic transitions are independent or not . for example , even if the effective ratio @xmath5 in the presence of new physics is small , or the effective @xmath6 is large , we can discuss independence of the nonadiabatic transitions .",
    "in this section , we review the standard treatment of the neutrino oscillations with two flavor .",

    "for the nonadiabatic transitions with three flavor , the neutrino can have two jumping points . when these two points are approximately far apart , from the analogy with eq.([eq:2f ] ) , we get the survival probability of the electron neutrino  @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 here , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the jumping probabilities at the lower and higher crossing point each other , and @xmath53 are the elements of the three flavor mns matrix .",

    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "( i ) we refer to the standard value  @xcite for the first three oscillation parameters .",
    "( ii ) we assume that the cp phase @xmath48 is equal to zero .",

    "the result implies that ica is not applicable when @xmath1 is large and when @xmath3 is small .",

    "thus , the new parameter @xmath99 describes the results in tab.[tab : ica ] very well .",

    "it is remarkable that these parameters in eqs.([eq : klhin ] ) are independent of the density profile @xmath54 .",
    "in the previous section , we have investigated whether ica held or not , and the neutrino energy which requires ica to break down ranges in the interval @xmath107 . at high energy , the effect of the absorption of the neutrino by medium",
    "becomes nonnegligible .",
    "let us consider this effect first .",
    "the reaction number of the neutrino @xmath108 is @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the luminosity of neutrino , @xmath111 is the cross section of neutrino  nucleus and @xmath112 is the matter density .",
    "here we estimated the matter density @xmath113 at @xmath114 .",

    "therefore , our hypothesis that high energy neutrinos are emitted at the center of a supernova and are observed outside of the supernova may not make sense .",
    "secondly , in dense matter for which there are two crossing points , the neutrino density @xmath117 becomes large too .",
    "in such a case , the neutrino ",
    "neutrino interaction is strong  @xcite . adding this effect , we need to incorporate @xmath117 , which is time  dependent , into the off ",
    "diagonal parts for @xmath10 ( see eqs.([eq:3flavors ] ) ) .",
    "no formula of the nonadiabatic transitions attended by this effect have been established even the formulae with two flavor . in our study , we have assumed that the two jumping points are far apart from the range where the neutrino  neutrino interactions become important .",
    "in this paper , we addressed the question whether the independent crossing approximation ( ica ) holds or not . ref .",
    "@xcite has focused on the picture of the non  overlapping resonance by which they judge whether two nonadiabatic transitions are independent or not .",
    "one of the purposes of this study is to check whether this interpretation is correct or not .",
    "first of all , we have checked the dependence of ica on the neutrino energy .",
    "namely , we checked the dependence of ica on the distance between the higher and lower crossing points . by numerical calculations , we showed that ica is independent of the neutrino energy , that is , the distance between two crossing points .",
    "secondly , we have checked the validity of the picture of the non  overlapping resonance for ica by varying the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 in the hypothetical ranges .",
    "we found numerically that ica can hold even if two resonances overlap , i.e. , ica does not always break down even if two resonant widths overlap .",
    "finally , we have introduced the new parameters as the criterion of ica . with this criterion of ica",
    ", we interpret the ica breaking as the sign of a large contribution of the off  diagonal coefficients , for example , the contribution of @xmath97 at the lower resonance .",
    "we have shown that the new parameters  the criterion of ica , taking the extra contribution into consideration , describe well whether ica holds or not .    from the recent experiments , we know that the ratio @xmath118 is large  @xcite and the mixing angle @xmath1 is small  @xcite .",
    "therefore the ica breaking is tiny enough for the two nonadiabatic transitions to be regarded as independent , and all we need is just to multiply @xmath119 and @xmath120 which are obtained by the two flavor formalism , as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper , we have dealt with the only the neutrino  electron interaction .",
    "in other cases , for example , where neutrino transition moments couple to the large magnetic fields  @xcite , under the influence of the neutrino ",
    "neutrino interaction  @xcite , or under the influence of the non  standard interaction  @xcite",
