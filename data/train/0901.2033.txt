    "recent advances in observational cosmology have revealed that our universe has experienced at least two different stages of accelerated expansion .",
    "one is the inflation in the very early universe when its tiny patch was superluminally stretched to become our observable universe today .",
    "this can naturally explain why the universe is flat , homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "inflation is driven by a potential energy of a scalar ( or multi - scalar ) called inflaton and its quantum fluctuations turn out to be the primordial density fluctuations which seed the observed large - scale structures ( lss ) and anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "the other one is accelerating expansion driven by dark energy ( de ) which dominates the energy density of the universe currently .",
    "understanding the nature of dark energy is among the biggest problems in modern physics and has been studied actively in the literature .    at present , the high quality observational data , cmb@xcite , lss@xcite and type ia supernovae ( sn ia)@xcite and so on , have provided the stringent constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , current data can constrain the primordial scalar power spectrum index @xmath3 and the energy density of dark energy component @xmath4 to @xmath5 level @xcite . besides the current observations , there are many ongoing projects , such as planck@xcite , lamost@xcite and snls@xcite . these projects",
    "will provide more accurate measurements on cmb temperature anisotropies and polarization , lss matter power spectrum and the luminosity distance , which will be helpful for studies of inflation and dark energy and determinations of cosmological parameters .",
    "generally , the current data analysis bases on the simple parameterizations of the primordial power spectrum and the equation of state ( eos ) of de . however , we note that some inflation models can generate the power spectrum with some modulated wiggles .",
    "this picture can be realized by the inflaton field with a step function of the potential @xciteor oscillating potential@xcite .",
    "the effects from the trans - planckian initial condition can also lead to oscillations which do imprint directly on the primordial scalar power spectrum@xcite .",
    "the bouncing model driven by the quintom@xcite matter can also give rise to some wiggles in the primordial scale - invariant power spectrum , because in this model the universe initially experiences a contracting stage , after the contracting phase it bounces to an inflationary phase , therefore the primordial fluctuations in sub - hubble region would deviate from that generated in bunch - davies vacuum@xcite .",
    "the quintom bounce provide a solution to initial singularity problem , and in this scenario there s no trans - planckian problem since we can choose the initial condition via contracting phase .",
    "the featured primordial scalar perturbation spectrum with local bumps are studied in ref.@xcite .    in some sense , the study for de is similar to inflation , either in model building or data fitting .",
    "the featured eos of de , especially the oscillatory behavior eos can provide us an unconventional evolution of universe .",
    "observationally , these kinds of modulated eos will leave clew on the hubble diagram or the matter power spectrum as well as the temperature power spectrum of cmb , which give us some hints to test such a scenario .",
    "the periodic oscillatory eos can be realized by the two scalar field quintom matter@xcite . and in ref.@xcite , a class of quintom models with an oscillating equation of state have been studied .",
    "in such a scenario , the early inflation and the current acceleration of the universe can be unified , the scale factor keeps increasing from one period to another and leads naturally to a highly flat universe .",
    "the periodic recurs will not lead to big crunch nor big rip and the coincidence problem can be reconciled by the vicissitudinary repetition .",
    "also , the studied relevant to these kind of oscillating de can be found in @xcite .",
    "given the above progress in the astronomical observations and physical motivations , it can potentially lead us to study issues related to the featured structure of primordial spectrum and the eos of de .",
    "in this paper , we aim to study the constraints on such kind of featured parametrization of the primordial spectrum as well as the eos of de .",
    "we perform the global fitting by using the markov chain monte carlo method with the current data from cmb , lss and sn , and also from the simulated future projects , such as planck , 5-year supernovae legacy survey ( snls ) and lamost .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the method of fitting and data we used in our analysis . the results and discussions are given in section iii .",
    "the last section is on the summary .",
    "as mentioned before , there are many theoretical models which can provide the non - trivial structure on the primordial power spectrum and eos of de . in order to study the oscillating primordial scalar power spectrum independent of the specific model , we parameterize the power spectrum @xmath6 as : [ paramtrize_inf ] _ ( k)= a_s(k)+()- , where , @xmath7 is the amplitude of primordial power spectrum",
    ", @xmath8 is the scale pivot and is set as @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 characterizes the tilt of spectrum while @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the contribution of featured oscillation .",
    "comparing with the traditional definition of spectral index , we get n_s = = n_s0+n_amp[par_inf ] , and one can find that for small @xmath12 , this parametrization goes back to the traditional form , i.e. the last term in the right hand side of equation above gives rise to the running of the scalar spectral index .    for the parametrization of de , we take the form given in @xcite : [ par_eos]w(a)=w_0+w_amp . this oscillating behavior in the eos can lead to the modulations on the hubble diagram or a recurrent universe which unifies the early inflation and the current acceleration . in refs.@xcite",
    "some preliminary studies have been presented on this kind of de model .",
    "we noticed that there are some hints on the oscillating behavior for example as shown in the fig .",
    "10 of the snia paper @xcite and see also paper in ref .",
    "our sine function has the advantage of preserving the oscillating feature of the de eos at high redshift measured by the cmb data . for simplicity and focusing on the study at lower redshift , we set @xmath13 to be @xmath14 in order to allow the eos to evolve more than one period within the redshift range of @xmath15 to @xmath16 , where the snia data are most robust . for the @xmath17cdm model , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we extend the publicly available mcmc package cosmomc@xciteby including dark energy perturbation@xcite , and we assume the adiabatic initial condition in our calculation .",

    "if the likelihood function is gaussian , @xmath31 coincides with the usual definition of @xmath32 up to an additive constant corresponding to the logarithm of the normalization factor of @xmath33 .",

    "the supernovae data we use are the recently released  union \" compilation of 307 samples @xcite . in the calculation of the likelihood from snia we marginalize over the relevant nuisance parameter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we make use of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) measurement of the hubble parameter @xmath34h  km  s@xmath35  mpc@xmath35 @xcite by multiplying the likelihood by a gaussian likelihood function centered around @xmath36 and with a standard deviation @xmath37 . we also impose a weak gaussian prior on the baryon density @xmath38 ( 1 @xmath39 ) from the big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite , and a cosmic age tophat prior as 10 gyr @xmath40 20 gyr .",
