    "the galactic center ( gc ) provides a unique laboratory for a detailed study of the interplay between massive star formation and galactic nuclear environment .",
    "particularly interesting is the presence of a young massive stellar cluster around sgr a@xmath1  the super - massive black hole ( smbh ) of the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this cluster , with an integrated mass of @xmath2 , has an age of @xmath3 yrs and a flat initial mass function ; therefore a considerable number of supernovae ( sne ) should have occurred in this region .",
    "the presence of their stellar end - products ( e.g. , pulsars ) and supernova remnants ( snrs ) could be responsible for various high - energy phenomena observed in the gc region and could also have strong impacts on the environment , and hence on accretion onto the smbh ( e.g. , @xcite ; for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , no pulsar has yet been found within @xmath4 of the galactic center .",
    "traditional radio searches at @xmath5 ghz are insensitive to pulsars in this region because interstellar scattering causes severe pulse broadening @xcite . at high frequencies ( @xmath6 ghz ) , where pulse broadening ( @xmath7 ) is not as important , blind pulsar searches are difficult because radio telescope beams are small and because pulsar spectra are typically steep , with correspondingly less flux available . more productive are searches in the hard ( @xmath8 kev ) x - ray band , where young pulsars , their wind nebulae ( pwne ) , and/or snrs can be identified by x - ray imaging . indeed , strong x - ray emission from snr sgr  a  east , near sgr a@xmath1 , has long been known .",
    "in particular , @xcite have suggested that a point - like hard x - ray source cxogc  j174545.5285829 , or `` cannonball '' , is a candidate of a young pulsar , which may have been ejected from the snr .",
    "recently , from the larger gc region @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have detected three x - ray threads associated with nonthermal radio filaments or radio `` wisps '' .",
    "these highly polarized radio features , observed only in the gc , are due to synchrotron radiation from relativistic particles ( electrons and/or positrons ) .",
    "the detection of the x - ray counterparts to these filaments provides strong constraints on the particle acceleration mechanism .",
    "the x - ray emission , if also due to the synchrotron process , must arise from particles accelerated nearly _ in situ_. a possible origin of these particles is pwne , perhaps shaped by the strong magnetic field and/or ram - pressure of the gc @xcite .",
    "alternatively , some of the x - ray threads may represent shocks of young snrs @xcite .",
    "here we report on our study of a prominent nonthermal x - ray feature which probably represents the most convincing case for the presence of a young pulsar in the gc .",

    "the point - like radio emission from the putative pulsar may be too faint to be present in existing observations and may be beamed away from our direction .",

    "this enhancement does not seem to be associated with any stellar complex and shows an unusually low radio recombination to continuum ratio ( shukla , yun , & scoville 2004 ) .",
    "the enhancement seems to be aligned well with the x - ray - emitting  and thus may represent the terminal shock of the downstream flow .",
    "we do not expect a significant accumulation of the radio - emitting synchrotron particles in the pwn , however , because of their efficient ics cooling in the strong ambient photon field (   5 ) .",

    "in addition , younger and more massive stellar clusters , such as arches and quintuplet , are not detected as tev sources in the hess survey .",
    "g359 as a pwn gives a ready explanation for the vhe @xmath77-ray emission , as the well - known example of the crab nebula shows .",
    "interestingly , the only other hess source within the inner @xmath82 region of the gc is a known pwn in snr  g0.9 + 0.1 @xcite .",
    "an one - zone synchrotron plus ics model well describes the data from radio to vhe @xmath77-ray with reasonable physical parameters of the pwn .",
    "we note that @xcite have proposed that the vhe @xmath77-ray radiation from the vicinity of sgr a@xmath1 may be produced by a hypothetic wind nebula , which could be produced by the smbh , in a way similar to a pwn .",

    "this approximation is good for @xmath85 @xcite , i.e. , when the photon energy in the rest frame of the particle is considerably smaller than @xmath86 .",
    "otherwise , the compton recoil ( discrete energy gain ) by the particle must be accounted for , resulting in the so - called klein - nishina ( kn ) effect , or the reduction of the ics efficiency . as a result , the ics of ultraviolet photons , which are abundantly produced by massive gc stars , to the tev regime is strongly suppressed . instead ,",
    "the dominant ics seed photon source for the tev radiation in the vicinity of sgr a@xmath1 is the far infrared ( fir ) emission ( dust - reprocessed stellar light ) with an energy density of @xmath87 and a characteristic photon energy of @xmath88 ev @xcite .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the fir - to - tev ics , assuming that  is located in the vicinity of sgr a@xmath1 .    to check the relative importance of the ics and the synchrotron emission in particle cooling , we also need to consider the photon to magnetic energy density ratio @xmath89 .",

    "we can estimate the tev flux from the ics , based on the observed x - ray synchrotron emission of  (   3 ) .",
    "the differential photon flux of the synchrotron emission as a function of @xmath77 can be approximately expressed as @xmath103 where the index @xmath104 is chosen because both @xmath105 and @xmath106 are likely greater than @xmath107 (  4 ) .",

    "the object could be a binary companion of the pulsar . in this case",
    ", the ambient medium must be relatively dense , because a binary is physically not expected to travel at a speed as high as would be expected for an isolated pulsar . a proper motion of [ oeg99]192 at a few @xmath124  km  s@xmath45 would also have been noticed in existing monitoring observations of the gc . alternatively , the object is not related to the pulsar .",

    "the mere presence of such a coherent feature in this dynamic region is quite extraordinary , where strong winds ( e.g. , from sgr a@xmath1 and the gc cluster ) , or even the turbulent motion of hot gas , may be expected to have high velocities up to @xmath125 . for the ram - pressure confinement to work",
    ", the relative motion between the  pulsar and the ambient medium should have a velocity at least of the same order , unless the pulsar happens to run into a relative dense cloud , which may be indicated by the somewhat higher absorption toward  than toward other sources in the region (   3 ) .",
    "furthermore , to produce the observed orientation this velocity should be in the opposite direction of the  x - ray tail , i.e. , in the similar direction of the expected outward winds .",
    "one possible way to generate such a high velocity is that the  pulsar was ejected dynamically from the close vicinity of the smbh or an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one plausible site for the pulsar ejection from an imbh is the irs 13 complex . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the complex is the remnant core of a massive star cluster and may contain an imbh , which helps to bound the system from a complete disruption by the tidal field of the smbh ( see also @xcite ) . as shown in   3 ,",
    "the comparable x - ray intensities and spectral signatures of irs 13 and sgr a@xmath1 indicate that similar emission processes are involved .",
    "thus , the putative imbh may play a role in the x - ray emission from irs 13 . with the present separation of @xmath126@xmath21  between irs 13 and",
    ", the required travel time of the pulsar is @xmath127  yrs  @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the proper motion of the pulsar ( in units of @xmath130 ) relative to irs 13 . during this period of time",
    ", the irs 13 complex should be moving at @xmath131 under the gravitational pull of the smbh with a mass of @xmath132 .",
    "the complex may have traveled a considerable fraction of the distance that the  has done after the ejection , which may explain a slight misalignment between irs 13 and .",
    "alternatively , this misalignment or the slight bending of the  tail to the west ( fig .  [ ims ] ) may be caused by the momentum impact of the winds from the sgr a@xmath1 and the gc cluster .",
    "the  pulsar , if indeed ejected dynamically from irs 13 , could then be formed much earlier .",
    "this opens up a possible connection between the pulsar / irs 13 and snr sgr  a  east , which has an age of @xmath133 yrs @xcite .",
    "the current separation between the explosion site ( irs 13 ) and the snr could be caused partly by the ambient ram - pressure inserted on the latter .",
    "it is also entirely possible that  is not directly related to irs  13 itself and/or the sgr  a  east snr .",
    "but   may still likely originate in the gc cluster , to which irs  13 belongs , and may be responsible for much of the diffuse and apparently thermal x - ray - emitting structure in the vicinity of sgr a@xmath1 (   3 ) .",
    "the small ionization parameter ( @xmath134  s  @xmath135 ; table  [ tab : spec ] ) indicates that the gas was heated only recently .",
    "the structure may represent heated ejecta of the sn that produced the  pulsar .",
    "the evolution of this snr could have been affected substantially by the winds from both young and old stars and from sgr a@xmath1 as well as by the large differential rotation and the strong magnetic field that thread the ambient medium .",
    "it is , however , beyond the scope of the present work to carefully examine these processes in the remnant evolution , let alone its interaction with the pwn .",
    "if  indeed results from a separate explosion , sgr  a  east is then not the only snr that has recently influenced the gc environment , hence the accretion of the smbh .",
    "while the pwn interpretation of the  can be firmly established only when a periodic signal from the pulsar is detected , observations with fast timing capability are the natural next step . based on the above results , we have estimated the exposure time needed to detect putative pulsations from  using  hrc or _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn observations acquired in the fastest imaging / timing mode . with the limited sensitivity or spatial resolution of these instruments",
    ", however , such an observation will need an exposure in excess of a mega - second .",
    "we thus strongly encourage follow - up timing observations of  in radio , near - ir , or possibly @xmath77-ray .    in conclusion ,  as a ram - pressure",
    "confined pwn provides a natural interpretation for the observed steady x - ray flux , comet - shape morphology , featureless hard nonthermal spectrum , and spectral steepening away from the putative pulsar .",
    "the presence of this pwn may also be responsible for much of the enhanced diffuse x - ray emission and the vhe @xmath77-ray source in the vicinity of sgr a@xmath1 .",
    "an understanding of this energetic nonthermal x - ray feature , whatever its true nature may be , is important for studying the nuclear environment of the galaxy .",
    "we thank r. genzel for providing the sinfoni near - ir image , m. muno , r. sari , and p. goldreich for valuable comments , and the anonymous referee for useful suggestions that led to various improvements in the paper .",
