    "a simple cosmological model , a flat universe with nearly scale - invariant adiabatic gaussian fluctuations , has proven to be a remarkably good fit to ever improving cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data @xcite , large - scale structure data @xcite , supernova data @xcite , cluster measurements @xcite , distance measurements @xcite , measurements of strong @xcite and weak @xcite gravitational lensing effects .",
    "observations of cmb have been playing an essential role in testing the model and constraining its basic parameters .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "satellite @xcite has been measuring temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cmb over the full sky since 2001 . with 7 years of integration ,",
    "the errors in the temperature spectrum at each multipole are dominated by cosmic variance ( rather than by noise ) up to @xmath12 , and the signal - to - noise at each multipole exceeds unity up to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of primary cmb on smaller angular scales has been measured by other experiments up to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the polarization data show the most dramatic improvements over our earlier _ wmap _  results : the temperature - polarization cross power spectra measured by _ wmap _  at @xmath15 are still dominated by noise , and the errors in the 7-year cross power spectra have improved by nearly 40% compared to the 5-year cross power spectra . while the error in the power spectrum of the cosmological @xmath8-mode polarization @xcite averaged over @xmath16 is cosmic - variance limited",
    ", individual multipoles are not yet cosmic - variance limited .",
    "moreover , the cosmological @xmath10-mode polarization has not been detected @xcite .    the temperature - polarization ( te and tb ) power spectra offer unique tests of the standard model .",
    "the te spectrum can be predicted given the cosmological constraints from the temperature power spectrum , and the tb spectrum is predicted to vanish in a parity - conserving universe .",
    "they also provide a clear physical picture of how the cmb polarization is created from quadrupole temperature anisotropy .",
    "we show the success of the standard model in an even more striking way by measuring this correlation in map space , rather than in harmonic space .",
    "the constraints on the basic 6 parameters of a flat @xmath1cdm model ( see table  [ tab : summary ] ) , as well as those on the parameters beyond the minimal set ( see table  [ tab : deviation ] ) , continue to improve with the 7-year _ wmap _  temperature and polarization data , combined with improved external astrophysical data sets . in this paper",
    ", we shall give an update on the cosmological parameters , as determined from the latest cosmological data set .",
    "our best estimates of the cosmological parameters are presented in the last columns of table  [ tab : summary ] and [ tab : deviation ] under the name `` _ wmap_+bao+@xmath0 . '' while this is the minimal combination of robust data sets such that adding other data sets does not significantly improve most parameters , the other data combinations provide better limits than _ wmap_+bao+@xmath0 in some cases .",
    "for example , adding the small - scale cmb data improves the limit on the primordial helium abundance , @xmath17 ( see table  [ tab : yhe ] and section  [ sec : helium ] ) , the supernova data are needed to improve limits on properties of dark energy ( see table  [ tab : darkenergy ] and section  [ sec : darkenergy ] ) , and the power spectrum of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ; see section  [ sec : lrg ] ) improves limits on properties of neutrinos ( see footnotes g , h , and i in table  [ tab : deviation ] and sections  [ sec : massnu ] and [ sec : neff ] ) .",
    "the cmb can also be used to probe the abundance as well as the physics of clusters of galaxies , via the sz effect @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall present the _ wmap _",
    "measurement of the averaged profile of sz effect measured towards the directions of known clusters of galaxies , and discuss implications of the _ wmap _  measurement for the very small - scale ( @xmath18 ) power spectrum recently measured by the south pole telescope ( spt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and atacama cosmology telescope ( act ; * ? ? ?",

    "one possibility is that protons and electrons do not share the same temperature .",

    "<S> the combination of 7-year data from _ wmap _   and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions . by combining the _ wmap _  data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the distribution of galaxies @xcite and the hubble constant ( @xmath0 ) measurement @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the parameters of the simplest 6-parameter @xmath1cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> the power - law index of the primordial power spectrum is @xmath2  ( 68%  cl ) for this data combination , a measurement that excludes the harrison - zeldovich - peebles spectrum by 99.5%  cl . </S>",
    "<S> the other parameters , including those beyond the minimal set , are also consistent with , and improved from , the 5-year results . </S>",
    "<S> we find no convincing deviations from the minimal model . </S>",
    "<S> the 7-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak , which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter - radiation equality epoch . </S>",
    "<S> notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos , @xmath3 , and the effective number of neutrino species , @xmath4  ( 68%  cl ) , which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from _ </S>",
    "<S> wmap_+bao+@xmath0 , without high - redshift type ia supernovae , is @xmath5  ( 68%  cl ) . </S>",
    "<S> we detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring @xmath6  ( 68%  cl ) . </S>",
    "<S> we detect , and show on the map for the first time , the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations , an important test of physical processes at @xmath7 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the 7-year polarization data have significantly improved : we now detect the temperature-@xmath8-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21@xmath9 , compared to 13@xmath9 from the 5-year data . with the 7-year temperature-@xmath10-mode </S>",
    "<S> cross power spectrum , the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity - violating effects has improved by 38% to @xmath11 ( 68%  cl ) . </S>",
    "<S> we report significant detections of the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the measured sz signal agrees well with the expected signal from the x - ray data on a cluster - by - cluster basis . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is a factor of 0.5 to 0.7 times the predictions from `` universal profile '' of arnaud et al . , analytical models , and hydrodynamical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we find , for the first time in the sz effect , a significant difference between the cooling - flow and non - cooling - flow clusters ( or relaxed and non - relaxed clusters ) , which can explain some of the discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> this lower amplitude is consistent with the lower - than - theoretically - expected sz power spectrum recently measured by the south pole telescope collaboration . </S>"
