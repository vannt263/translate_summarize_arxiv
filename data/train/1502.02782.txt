    "<S> charge order has emerged as a generic feature of doped cuprates , leading to important questions about its origin and its relation to superconductivity . </S>",

    "<S> our results argue against an itinerant model for the charge order , implying instead that such order is likely due to coulombic phase separation of the doped holes .    following earlier nmr studies @xcite , recent x - ray experiments on underdoped cuprates have detected short range charge density wave ( cdw ) order with a period of 3 to 5 lattice spacings in ybco @xcite , and in bi based @xcite and hg based cuprates @xcite . for ybco , the doping range where the charge order has been observed @xcite coincides with the doping range where quantum oscillation experiments detect reconstruction of the fermi surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in conventional cdw systems , the charge order is thought to have s - wave symmetry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite and resonant soft x - ray scattering @xcite data have revealed a novel d - wave symmetry , where the two oxygen ions in a cuo@xmath1 unit are out of phase . </S>",
    "<S> this charge order differs from the more robust stripe order seen earlier in la based compounds @xcite , which appears to have s - wave symmetry instead @xcite . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> though , the wavevector is oriented along the bond direction @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the search for d - wave symmetry was motivated by earlier theoretical studies of metlitski and sachdev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have shown that charge order is competitive with d - wave superconductivity in a spin fluctuation model . </S>",
    "<S> this instability has a d - wave form factor , with a diagonal wavevector that spans fermi surface points ( hot spots ) that intersect the antiferromagnetic zone boundary of the undoped phase ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the subsequent observation of charge order in ybco motivated a number of follow up studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of these studies are either based on an expansion around the hot spots , with the fermi surface curvature treated as a perturbation @xcite , or rely on a weak coupling approximation . </S>",
    "<S> so , the question arises whether these results survive in a strong coupling treatment where these approximations are not made .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we solve the strong coupling instability equation for the charge order in the entire brillouin zone including the full momentum and frequency dependence of the bosonic and fermionic spectra . this formalism has been used in the past to study d - wave superconductivity originating from spin fluctuations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been used to study instabilities in the particle - hole channel @xcite . recently </S>",
    "<S> , this formalism was used by us to examine the effect of the pseudogap on spin - fluctuation mediated pairing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the one approximation we make is that the bosonic and fermionic spectra are taken from experiment rather than self - consistently calculated . </S>",

    "<S> this is one of our main results , and differs from an analytic approximation quoted in earlier work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of a log divergence in our case is likely due to the curvature coming from the experimentally determined fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our bosonic spectrum is based on inelastic neutron and x - ray scattering measurements . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we are not in the extreme quantum critical regime considered in ref .  .    </S>",

    "<S> we now turn to the influence of the fermion self - energy . the fermion self - energy in a lowest order approximation is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the bare green s function . since our previous @xmath9 was based on arpes data , we scale it by a factor of two to get an approximation to the bare dispersion , with a bare nodal fermi velocity @xmath403.2ev -  . for the spin - fluctuation interaction , </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath41ev and keep the rest of the parameters the same as before . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling strength renormalizes the nodal fermi velocity to @xmath42ev -  , which is comparable to the experimental value . to keep the shape of the fermi surface intact </S>",
    "<S> , we drop the term proportional to @xmath43 in the self - energy calculation ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : se2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we now use this dressed green s function ( @xmath44 ) for the instability analysis in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : cdw ] . its effect ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tdep : eigenvaluefullg ] ) is to additionally suppress the diagonal charge order ( presumably due to the energy smearing of @xmath7 ) . as a consequence , for experimentally relevant parameters </S>",
    "<S> , only d - wave superconductivity remains as a robust instability in this model .    </S>",
    "<S> our results cast doubt on an itinerant spin fluctuation mediated origin for the observed charge order . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the observed wavevector on doping @xcite is suggestive that the fermi surface is playing some role as in classic cdw systems . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the la based cuprates whose doping dependence is opposite to this , as would be expected from a real space picture where the wavevector is proportional to the doping . in classic cdw systems </S>",
    "<S> like _ 2h_-nbse@xmath1 , phonons play an important role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one could think that this might be the case in the cuprates as well , where anomalies have been seen in both optic @xcite and acoustic @xcite phonon modes near the charge ordering vector . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that @xmath45 phonon modes have been postulated to be responsible for dispersion anomalies seen in photoemission near the antinodes @xcite , and perhaps their d - wave symmetry is related to that of the charge order . in support of this , </S>",
    "<S> several theoretical studies have suggested that coupling of the electrons to such modes can cause d - wave charge order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we examine this idea by including the phonon mediated interaction along with the spin - fluctuation mediated interaction in the cdw instability equation . under the assumption that the electron - phonon interaction is modest , we do not find that its addition has sufficient strength to cause a cdw instability either ( see supplementary material ) .    </S>",
    "<S> none of the above means that spin mediated interactions are irrelevant for the charge order , but our results indicate that an itinerant treatment of the problem in a parameter range appropriate to experiment is not adequate to capture the resulting physics . in that context </S>",
    "<S> , we point to real space treatments of the @xmath46 model like density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) which indicate a strong tendency to bond - centered charge order in the underdoped regime @xcite , with the d - wave structure likely due to coulomb repulsion which acts to enforce charge neutrality in each unit cell .    </S>",
    "<S> _ note added in proof . </S>",
    "<S> _ after the original submission of this work , a critique of it has been offered by wang and chubukov @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their primary criticism revolves around two points - that in the original submission , we neglected the fermion self - energy that they argue lessens the detrimental impact of the fermi surface curvature , and that our value of @xmath18 is too small by an order of magnitude . in regards to the first point , using dressed green s functions , we now find strong suppression of the charge order , even for diagonal wavevectors . in regards to the second point </S>",
    "<S> , our value of @xmath18 is based on experiment , and an order of magnitude larger value would lead to a spin fluctuation energy scale at the @xmath47 point of the zone of 4 ev , in gross disagreement with inelastic x - ray scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> we also comment that the logarithmic temperature divergence of the eigenvalue derived for bond centered charge order in their work is based on analytic approximations which we feel are not valid for experimentally realistic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , we find no evidence for a log in our own numerical studies , even for a @xmath15 as large as 10@xmath25 ( see supplementary material ) . as an additional note , </S>",
