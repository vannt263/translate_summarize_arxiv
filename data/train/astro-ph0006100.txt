    "recent works have emphasized that globular clusters ( gcs ) are stellar systems which exhibit strong dynamical evolution in the potential well of their host galaxy ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 , hereafter go97 , murali & weinberg 1997 ) . since their birth , gcs",
    "suffer internal evolution on their own : at the very beginning gcs evolve rapidly because of the fast stellar evolution of their massive stars ( vesperini & heggie 1997 , portegies zwart et al .",
    "the finite size of the gcs produces two - body relaxation between the member stars ; equipartition of energy heats the lighter stars which diffuse outwards into the halo while the heavier stars sink slowly towards the contracting core ( spitzer & hart 1971 ) . typically , the relaxation time @xmath1 ( hereafter we will refer to the relaxation time at the half mass radius ; see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) in a gc is of the order of @xmath2 yr ( go97 ) , which is significantly less than the age of all galactic globular clusters .    owing to the negative specific heat in self - gravitating stellar systems ( antonov 1962 , lynden - bell & wood 1968 ) ,",
    "related to the virial equilibrium , the core is contracting monotonically during a process called the `` gravothermal catastrophe '' , leading to core collapse , characterized by very high stellar densities ( up to @xmath3 ) .",
    "it has been eventually recognized that this process is not so catastrophic after all , since the cluster core does not collapse for ever but bounces back towards lower stellar density phases ( hnon 1975 ) .",
    "the key role of binaries ( either primordial or formed via encounters during the high stellar density phase ) has been emphasized in the internal dynamics of the gcs : these binaries act as a heating source and slow down the core collapse ( goodman & hut 1989 ) and even reverse it .",
    "many authors have studied numerically the post core - collapse phase , using conducting - gas - sphere , fokker - planck , and n - body codes , in simulations computed well into core collapse and beyond , leading to the discovery of possible post - collapse gravothermal oscillations ( see meylan & heggie 1997 for a review ) .",
    "globular clusters evolve dynamically , even when considering only relaxation , which causes stars to escape , consequently cluster cores to contract and envelopes to expand .    any galaxy through its gravitational potential well influences the dynamical evolution of its globular clusters , accelerating their destruction .",
    "the stars in the globular cluster halo are stripped by the tidal field of the galaxy : the outward diffusion of the stars towards the sub - thermalised halo is speeded up and the core contracts even more ( spitzer & chevalier 1973 ) .",
    "moreover the gravitational shocks heat up the outer parts of the globular cluster , increasing its loss of stars ( aguilar et al .",
    "1988 , weinberg 1994 , kundic & ostriker 1995 , leon et al .",
    "shocks are caused by the tidal field of the galaxy : interactions with the disk , the bulge and , at a lower level , with the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs , see spitzer 1958 ) , heat up the outer regions of each star clusters .",
    "the disk - shocking occurs when the gc crosses the thin disk where it is compressed by the varying z - component of the galactic plane potential ; this has been found to dominate the heating of gcs ( chernoff et al .",
    "a gc globally gains energy during the crossing and exhibits peculiar transient deformation ( leon et al .",
    "2000 ) . the shocks with the bulge and the gmcs are similar in their physical processes :",
    "the gcs suffer an elongation aligned parallel to the density gradient in the bulge or the gmc .",
    "these processes combined with the internal dynamical evolution have probably destroyed an important fraction of the primordial gcs and are still currently at play .",
    "go97 estimate that _",
    "`` half of the present clusters are to be destroyed within the next hubble time''_.",
    "all gcs are expected to have already lost an important fraction of their mass , deposited in the form of individual stars in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "the mass - loss rate is a function of the total mass of the cluster , its structural parameters like the concentration @xmath4 ( where @xmath4 = log ( @xmath5 )   with  and   are the tidal and core radii ) , and its orbital motion around the galactic center .",
    "till recently , the only way to investigate the orbital history of a globular cluster , apart from proper motions , was to derive its tidal radius , which gives an indication of its perigalactic distance .",
    "unfortunately , there are difficulties in defining the tidal radius , both theoretically and observationally ; and , as expected , there are discrepancies between the theoretical and observational values of the tidal radius ( see , e.g. , odenkirchen et al .  1997 ,",
    "scholz et al .  1998 ) .",
    "n - body simulations of globular clusters embedded in a realistic galactic potential ( oh & lin 1992 ; johnston et al .  1997 ; combes , leon & meylan 1999 , hereafter clm99 ) have been performed in order to study the amount of mass loss for different kinds of orbits and different kinds of clusters , along with the dynamics and the mass function in tidal tails .",
    "the 2-d structure of such tidal tails appears to be a good tracer of gravitational shocks and should be a tracer of the potential well",
    ". moreover the detection of unbound stars released by the clusters is the only way to measure directly the mass loss rate of the cluster .",
    "grillmair et al .  (",
    "1995 ) in an analysis of star - count in the outer parts of a few galactic globular clusters found extra - cluster overdensities that they associated partly with stars stripped into the galaxy field .",
    "similar tidal interaction remnants around globular clusters have also been found in external galaxies : grillmair et al.(1996 ) observed three clusters in m31 which exhibit departures from a king profiles .",
    "leon et al .  ( 1999 ) find tidal extensions in the outskirts of interacting binary clusters and isolated clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "not surprisingly , galactic tidal forces play also an essential role in the evolution of smaller - scale galactic clusters , the open clusters : they exhibit tidal tails in their neighborhood ( odenkirchen 1998 ; bergond et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in this work",
    "we study the 2-d structure of the tidal tails associated with 20 galactic globular clusters by using the wavelet transform to detect weak structures at large scale and filter the strong background noise for the low galactic latitude clusters .",
    "we analyze with great care the observational bias which can be very important . in section 2",
    "we present the observations , in section 3 we describe the data reduction , in section 4 we present the results with , for each globular cluster , detailed comments about related observational bias .",
    "section 5 presents the general discussion of all results .",
    ".list of observed globular clusters . about plates / films , eso and src stand for the plates of the corresponding two surveys .",
    "all the other plates / films are from our observations , except the two plates e131 and e1069 which are from the poss  i. [ cols=\"<,<,^,^ \" , ]     let us compare the amount of tidally stripped stars obtained in our simulations and observations . because of the magnitude limitation of the plates and films , it is likely that we underestimate the observed tidal tails .",
    "the mass of the tidal tails in the case of ngc  5139 has been computed for a salpeter law : if we assume a steep slope @xmath6= 2.8 for the mass function in the tidal tails , we get a tail mass equal to about 1  % of the total mass of the cluster , equal to 5.1 10@xmath7 . in spite of the great uncertainty on the star counts of the tidal tails ,",
    "such a large mass is an upper limit for the tidal tail mass from the simulations ( clm99 ) .",
    "it confirms both that ngc  5139 has a genuinely large total mass ( meylan et al .",
    "1995 ) and that the spectrum mass is likely less steep than @xmath8 in the outer part .",
    "all these considerations point toward a mass for the tidal tails between 0.6 and 1.0 % of the total mass of ngc  5139 . from n - body simulation performed by moore ( 1996 )",
    "we can note that the presence of tidal tails is the indication of low dark matter content in globular clusters .",
    "ngc  7492 and pal  12 provide an interesting comparison because of their similar characteristics : low masses ( 6 and 2 @xmath9 @xmath10 , respectively ) , low concentrations ( 1.0 and 0.9 , respectively ) , and large distances from the galactic center ( 23.5 and 14.7 kpc , respectively ) .",
    "they are also both strongly influenced by the galaxy : go97 compute @xmath11 = 77.8 and 17.9 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , their tidal tails appear strongly different , with a very extended structure for pal  12 and very tiny one for ngc  7492 .",
    "the last gravitational shock suffered by ngc  7492 , if any , has to have occured much before the last one for pal  12 .",
    "the long time since the last gravitational shock suffered ngc  7492 has allowed the surface density of the unbound stars to fade along the cluster orbit .",
    "we estimate the last tidal shock suffered by pal 12 to be about 350 myr .",
    "we have observed 20 galactic globular clusters with multi - color schmidt plates and films on wide fields .",
    "field and cluster stars are sorted in the color - magnitude plane . a star - count analysis is performed on the color selected stars to study the overdensities that can be attributed to the stars stripped from the globular clusters by tidal shocks ( disk / bulge ) as well as from internal dynamical evolution .",
    "we use the wavelet transform in order to enhance the weak tidal structures at large scales and in order to filter the high background noise at low galactic latitude . after highlighting the observational biases resulting from dust extinction and background galaxy clustering at faint magnitudes , we reach the following conclusions :    * all the clusters observed , which do not suffer from strong observational biases , present tidal tails , tracing their dynamical evolution in the galaxy ( evaporation , tidal shocking , tidal torquing , and bulge shocking ) . * the clusters in the following sub - sample ( viz .",
    "ngc  104 , ngc  288 , ngc  2298 , ngc  5139 , ngc  5904 , ngc  6535 , and ngc  6809 ) exhibit tidal extensions resulting from a shock , i.e. tails aligned with the tidal field gradient . * the clusters in another sub - sample ( viz .",
    "ngc  1261 , ngc  1851 , ngc  1904 , ngc  5694 , ngc  5824 , ngc  6205 , ngc  7492 , pal  5 , and pal  12 ) present extensions which are likely tracing the orbital path of the cluster with various degrees of mass loss .",
    "* ngc  7492 is a striking case because of its very small extension and its high destruction rate driven by the galaxy as computed by go97 .",
    "its dynamical `` twin '' for such an evolution , namely pal  12 , exhibits , on the contrary , a large extension tracing its orbital path , with a possible shock which happened more than 350  myr . * the velocity diffusion of the stripped stars is tentatively estimated , in one case ( viz .",
    "ngc  6254 ) , to be similar to the cluster velocity dispersion . *",
    "thanks to the relatively small distance of ngc  5139 and its high release of unbound stars during its current disk shocking , we estimate the mass loss to be between 0.6 and 1  % of the cluster total mass , taking into account a possible mass segregation in the cluster halo . this mass loss rate is consistent with our estimates from n - body simulations ( clm99 ) . *",
    "the second break in the surface density slope , apart from the break at the tidal radius ( cf .",
    "the case of ngc  6254 ) could be an indicator of some recent gravitational shocks , with the indicator displaying a range of values between -0.9 and -2 .",
    "the latter is likely overestimated because of the uncorrected crowding towards the clusters .",
    "the use of better quality data , e.g. wide - field ccd observations , combined with the present star - count method will allow in a near future to get rid easily of the observational biases and to obtain a better color selection thanks to a more accurate photometry",
    ". these observations will provide more precise observational estimates of the mass loss rates for different regimes of galaxy - driven cluster evolution . with the help of numerical simulations and accurate proper motions",
    ", it will be possible to constrain efficiently the parameters describing the galactic potential ( disk scale - height , surface density , bulge size ) . in case of a flat dark matter halo ( pfenniger et al.1994 ) , the tidal shock on the globular clusters",
    "would be enhanced , depending on the surface density and the scale - height of this dark matter halo .",
    "pal  2 is a good candidate to probe such dark matter halo flattening , because of its small distance to the galactic plane ( z = -2.2 kpc ) and its relatively large distance to the galactic center ( 21.6 kpc ) , placing this cluster in a region where the tidal shocking by the disk only is expected to be low .",
    "we acknowledge warmly the eso schmidt telescope operators o. and g. pizarro , and the efficiency of the schmidt astronomers b. reipurth and j. brewer for the conduction of the observations .",
    "we would like to think the whole mama team for its efficient support .",
