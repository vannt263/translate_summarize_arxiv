    "the bulk of the infrared ( ir ) emission of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies is due to the thermal emission of the dust heated by the interstellar radiation field .",

    "the dust emitting in the far - ir ( @xmath2 @xmath3 70 @xmath0 m ) is probably composed of big grains ( with a linear radius @xmath4 @xmath3 200  ) of graphite and silicate in thermal equilibrium with the uv and optical photons of the interstellar radiation field ( dsert et al .",

    "the carriers of the uibs and associated continuum , often called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) although this assignment is uncertain , are heated stochastically by absorption of single photons and temporarily reach very high temperatures , at which most of the emission occurs ( dsert et al .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the knowledge of the dust emission properties of the ism strongly increased in the last years thanks to the large amount of data obtained by the iras satellite , which made an all  sky survey in 4 different filters , at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath0 m .",

    "this sample , which includes a large number of galaxies of different morphological type and luminosity , has been selected to be used as a reference for other studies .",
    "furthermore the sample includes objects in the centre and in the periphery of the cluster in order to study the effects of the environment on the dust emission and on the evolution of galaxies . because all the selected galaxies are at the same distance , the construction of a reference sample is quite direct .",

    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "because of time limitations , the sample has been restricted to include only galaxies within a projected distance of 2 degrees from m87 , thus belonging to the core of the cluster , and comparison objects in the cluster periphery .",
    "the cluster periphery is at an angular distance larger than 4 degrees from the position of the maximum projected galaxy density given by sandage et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , but excluding galaxies within 1.5 degrees of the m49 sub  cluster .",
    "the total sample includes 117 objects with morphological types between s0/a and i m and bcds . because of the low visibility of the virgo cluster during the iso mission and because of the low detection rate of small galaxies with isocam ,",
    "the 18 i m and bcds in the cluster core could not be observed .",
    "the resulting sample is still unbiased but includes only 99 objects , with 26 spirals in the cluster core , and 73 spirals , irregulars and bcds in the cluster periphery .",

    "a complete description of the observations and data reduction will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( boselli et al .",

    "40 to 70 integrations per position were used in the first raster position every time the background was expected to change significantely from the previous target , thus for significantly different pointings and for different filters . in order to minimize the overhead time for galaxy pointing and for the stabilisation of the detector , galaxies were observed in a concatenated mode , with a complete sequence of observations of 5 - 10 nearby galaxies in a given ( and fixed ) filter .",
    "all galaxies were observed in 2 filters , lw2 ( @xmath2 = 6.75 @xmath0 m , @xmath11@xmath2=5.00- 8.50 @xmath0 m ) and lw3 ( @xmath2 = 15.0 @xmath0 m , @xmath11@xmath2=12.0 - 18.0 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "images were reduced following the standard cia / idl procedures available at the isocam center at the cea in saclay : images were dark  subtracted , flat - fielded , deglitched , corrected for the transient response of the detector , and combined .",
    "the total fluxes were determined using the imcnts routine in iraf / xray after subtraction of the sky background ; counts were transformed in fluxes using the conversion factors given in the isocam manual .",
    "the absolute fluxes are believed to be accurate to within 30% , mainly due to calibration errors , but the relative fluxes of the observed galaxies are certainly more accurate .",
    "the detection rate is 70% at 6.75 @xmath0 m and 55% at 15.0 @xmath0 m ( see table 1 ) .",

    "in this section we analyse the mid  ir integrated properties of the observed galaxies by comparing the cam observations to data at other wavelengths : far  ir data at 60 and 100 @xmath0 m are taken from iras ( thuan & sauvage @xcite ) , near  ir magnitudes and optical data from boselli et al .",

    "we checked the influence of the environment by comparing the luminosity distribution of galaxies in the cluster core to that of galaxies in the periphery . since dwarf galaxies have been observed only in the periphery of the cluster ( see sect .",
    "2 ) , the present test was performed only for spirals ( sa - sm ) . a survival analysis ( isobe et al .",
    "@xcite ) , done to take into account upper limits , has shown , at least to the first order , no statistically significant differences between the normalized mid - ir emission of spirals in the core and in the periphery of the cluster .",

    "while the mid  ir emission ( per unit mass ) of the spirals and later systems are comparable , the average 6.75 and 15 @xmath0 m to k flux ratio of e , s0 and s0/a galaxies is significantely lower than that of spirals . at 15 @xmath0 m , where the difference is clearer , spirals have on average a mid  ir emission per unit mass higher by more than one order of magnitude than e - s0/a .",

    "optical and near  ir magnitudes are values integrated to the optical diameter at the 25 mag arcsec@xmath33 isophote , determined as described in gavazzi & boselli ( 1996 ) .",
    "optical and near  ir data for spiral galaxies with type @xmath6 sd are corrected for galactic and internal extinction as described in gavazzi & boselli ( @xcite ) . as shown by buat & xu ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the extinction for galaxies with type @xmath38 sd is @xmath1 0.2 mag in the uv at 2000  , thus only @xmath1 0.1 mag at optical wavelengths and even smaller in the near - ir .",
    "for this reason we prefer to not apply any internal extinction correction for sd - sm - im and bcd galaxies .",
    "buat & xu ( @xcite ) have shown that at 2000   the extinction is low ( @xmath1 0.9 mag ) , even in bright spirals ; this is confirmed by the lack of relationship between the uv / k flux ratio and the inclination of the sample galaxies , that we have checked .",
    "because of the large uncertainty in the determination of the extinction in the uv , we prefer to adopt uncorrected values .    in order to compare the sed of galaxies with different luminosities , all fluxes are normalized to the near  ir k flux and displayed in order of increasing morphological type ( see fig .",

    "the uv emission is only important in the latter objects ( gavazzi et al .",
    "the mid  ir emission of early  type spirals can be partly due to the rayleigh - jeans tail of the cold stellar component at least at 6.75 @xmath0 m .",
    "the far  ir emission of spirals and dwarfs seems correlated with the presence of young stars emitting in the uv .",
    "the scds and the sms have the highest mid  ir emission per unit mass , while lower  luminosity ims and bcds , which are characterised by a stronger uv radiation field , have on average a 6.75 and 15 @xmath0 m emission comparable to that of sc galaxies . in all spirals and",

    "we conclude that the mid  ir emission is dominated by the emission of the stars , as also shown by the analysis of the mid ",
    "ir / far  ir colour - colour relation ( boselli & lequeux  @xcite ; madden et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in table 2",
    "we list the average values ( in logarithmic scales ) of the 6.75 @xmath0 m to k , 15 @xmath0 m to k and 6.75 to 15 @xmath0 m flux ratios for the early - type objects in our sample .",
    "@xmath39    the average value found for the early  type sample of virgo galaxies listed in table 2 is similar to that determined for the s0 vcc 1978 ( ngc 4649 ) , whose 6.75 @xmath0 m diffuse emission , contrary to spiral galaxies , is not associated with any event of star formation as traced by the h@xmath40 image , as shown by boselli & lequeux ( @xcite ) .",
    "this observational evidence , along with the fact that most of the seds of the mid  ir emission of the early  type galaxies in the present sample seem to follow the rayleigh - jeans tail of the cold stellar component at about 3500 k , suggests that the average value listed in table 2 can be used , at least as a first approximation , to empirically estimate the stellar contribution to the mid  ir emission of later  type galaxies .",
    "boselli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have shown that there is a clear correlation between the far  ir emission and the uv flux of galaxies , while in the mid  ir the 6.75 and 15 @xmath0 m normalized fluxes are proportional to the star formation rate only for low or moderate activities .",
    "galaxies with strong uv radiation fields have , in general , a lower mid  ir emission .",
    "this result can be seen in fig .",
    "4 , where we plot the distribution of the spectral flux ( a ) and energy ( b ; defined as @xmath41f@xmath18 normalized to the energy in the k band ) for galaxies divided into 4 different classes of uv / k flux ratios .",
    "arbitrary thresholds on the uv / k ratios are chosen to include in each group a similar number of objects .",
    "the difference between the uv to k flux ratio of galaxies belonging to the 4 different classes is not the result of a selection due to the internal extinction in the uv flux , since all galaxies are well mixed in inclination , but is real and reflects the properties of the uv radiation field in their ism .",
    "black bodies with a temperature of t=20000 k , 6000 k and 3500 k are fitted by eye to the uv , optical and near - ir data , while a modified ( @xmath2@xmath33 ) black body with t=30 k is fitted by eye to the cold dust component emitting in the far  ir .",
    "the stellar emission of galaxies with log uv / k @xmath6 -2.8 is dominated by the cold component peaked in the near  ir . a hot stellar component ( t=20000 k ) is not needed to explain the uv emission of these galaxies , which is probably due to stars of intermediate mass and temperature .",
    "the cold stellar component ( @xmath2 @xmath1 1 @xmath0 m ) also dominates the peak of the energy distribution , with an energy balance @xmath1 100:1 between the optical - near - ir and the uv at 2000  .",
    "a typical case is the s0/sapec vcc 1003 .",
    "the mid - ir emission of these galaxies is dominated by the rayleigh - jeans tail of the cold stellar component at about 3500 k. as for galaxies with log uv / k @xmath6 -2.8 , the stellar emission and the energy distribution of galaxies with -2.8 @xmath6 log uv / k @xmath6 -2.0 is dominated by the cold component peaked in the near  ir .",
    "a typical case is the sab(s ) vcc 1727 .",
    "these galaxies are quiescent in the mid  ir and in the far  ir if compared to the intermediate ",
    "class objects ( -2.0 @xmath6 log uv / k @xmath6 -1.0 ) , which are also characterised by a higher contribution of the young stellar component to their global stellar emission ( as for example vcc 1987 ) .",
    "the galaxies with the most intense uv radiation fields ( log uv / k @xmath34 -1.0 ) , whose stellar emission and energy distribution are peaked at optical wavelengths , have the most intense far  ir emission for the sample galaxies .",
    "however their mid ",
    "ir emission is comparable to that of the objects with an intermediate star formation activity .",
    "a typical case is the bcd galaxy vcc 459 .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that in some bcds ( vcc 1 , vcc 24 , vcc 848 ) the emission at 6.75 @xmath0 m follows the sed of a cold stellar component , while at 15 @xmath0 m the dust emission is important .",
    "however if the stellar emission of these galaxies is dominated by hot stars , a black body at 3500 k overestimates the stellar flux at 6.75 @xmath0 m , and there must be some dust emission at this wavelength .    to identify the heating sources of the dust emitting in the mid and far  ir , we plot on fig .",
    "5 the relationships between the 6.75 , 15 and 100 @xmath0 m fluxes normalized to the k flux ( first line ) and to the uv flux ( second line ) versus the uv to k flux ratio , which is widely used as a star formation tracer .",
    "the strong relationship observed between the flux at 100 @xmath0 m and the uv flux confirms that the big grains responsable for the 100 @xmath0 m emission are heated by uv photons .",
    "the ratio of the energies emitted in the far  ir and in the uv is strongly related to the uv flux , is close to unity in low - mass galaxies ( open dots ) , and is @xmath42 10 in high - mass , quiescent early - type spirals ( filled dots ) .",
    "this strong relationship can be partly due to the effect of the extinction , which is expected to be higher in higher - mass , quiescent galaxies ( buat & xu  @xcite ) , and in part to the fact that optical photons might significantely contribute to the heating of the dust grains in the quiescent sample . as shown by boselli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , in low - mass galaxies with a strong star formation activity ( open dots ) the mid - ir emission at 6.75 @xmath0 m and marginally at 15 @xmath0 m , is anticorrelated with the intensity of the uv radiation field , while the fluxes at 6.75 and 15 @xmath0 m are well correlated with the uv flux in massive spirals ( filled dots ) . at the same time , the energy balance between uv photons and the mid  ir emission does not hold in galaxies with an intense uv radiation field because these galaxies are relatively transparent to uv radiation .",
    "the far  ir to uv energy ratio versus uv / k relationship is shared in the mid  ir only by massive spiral galaxies ; in the dwarf population ( open dots ) the relationship between @xmath41@xmath35f@xmath43/@xmath41@xmath44uv , @xmath41@xmath36f@xmath45/@xmath41@xmath44uv and the uv to k flux ratio has steeper slopes , indicating that the relation between the inciding uv photons and the emitting dust grains changes in strong uv radiation fields . the contribution of optical photons to the heating of the dust grains emitting in the mid ",
    "ir is negligible because of their small physical dimensions , thus the mid  ir to uv energy ratio vs. uv / k relationships are probably entirely due to the extinction .",
    "using as template the small sample of early  type galaxies listed in table 2 , we can estimate and remove the average stellar contribution to the total mid ",
    "ir emission of the target galaxies .",
    "we thus obtain that the corrected fluxes at 6.75 and 15 @xmath0 m are given by the relations :    @xmath46    and    @xmath47    as shown in fig .",
    "6 , when the corrected mid  ir values are used , a relationship between the mid  ir and the far  ir emission is observed even at low dust emissions .",
    "given the large uncertainty in the determination of the stellar contribution to the mid  ir emission of early  type galaxies , this method is reliable only for objects whose emission at 6.75 and 15 @xmath0 m is dominated by dust , thus we exclude from the following analysis all objects with log f@xmath35/k @xmath6 -0.55 .",
    "corrected fluxes at 6.75 and 15 @xmath0 m are used throughout the following analyses . in fig .",

    "the same result has been obtained using other less direct star formation indicators such as the b - k and u - b colours , and is valid for galaxies of all morphological types later than sa , spanning a large range in absolute magnitude .",

    "sauvage & thuan ( @xcite ) interpreted this observational evidence as the result of the fact that , at least in galaxies of type e - s0 to sbc , the far  ir colours are mostly controlled by the spatial distribution of dust relative to stars , and not by the star formation activity as in later - type objects . given the large intrinsic dispersion in the far - ir colours in each morphological class , the present data do not exclude that the trend observed by sauvage & thuan ( @xcite ) is present .    as already shown by boselli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the mixed colours f@xmath50/f@xmath52 and f@xmath51/f@xmath49 are anticorrelated with the uv radiation field : galaxies with a strong star formation activity have in general a higher far  ir to mid  ir emission . given the strong inverse relationship between the surface density of young ionizing stars and the luminosity or mass of a galaxy ( gavazzi et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the strong anticorrelation between the flux ratios f@xmath50/f@xmath52 and f@xmath51/f@xmath49 and the uv flux can be translated into a well defined relationship between the flux ratios f@xmath50/f@xmath52 and f@xmath51/f@xmath49 and the mass of a galaxy . a relationship with a larger dispersion",
    "is also observed between the mixed mid to far ",
    "ir colours and the morphological type .",
    "it is interesting to note that it is the near  ir luminosity more than the morphological type that discriminates the behaviour of the mid to far  ir flux ratio of a given object , with luminous and massive galaxies characterized by a given f@xmath50/f@xmath52 and f@xmath51/f@xmath49 flux ratio and low mass objects with smaller mid to far  ir flux ratios .",
    "the availability of an unbiased , optically  selected and complete sample allows us to statistically draw the average mid  ir properties of `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "we present for the first time the mid  ir luminosity distribution at 6.75 and 15 @xmath0 m of a complete , optically - selected sample of late  type galaxies .",
    "the present analysis clearly shows that the mid  ir emission of ellipticals and lenticulars ( morphological range e ",
    "s0/a ) is dominated by the rayleigh - jeans tail of the photospheric emission of the cold stellar component emitting in the near  ir .",
    "this is still true for some early  type quiescent spirals .",
    "figure 3 however does not exclude that some of these early  type objects have dust emitting in the mid  ir .",
    "madden et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , by analysing a large sample of early  type galaxies observed with isocam , have in fact shown that many objects characterized by the presence of atomic or molecular gas , or by nuclear star formation , have a mid  ir emission already dominated by the dust at @xmath2 @xmath34 6 @xmath0 m ( madden et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; madden et al . in preparation ) .",
    "in late - type galaxies the mid - ir emission is generally dominated by dust .",
    "the strong relationship between the integrated uv flux at 2000   and the mid - ir emission ( both normalized to the mass of the galaxy ) observed by boselli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) indicates that the very small dust grains and the uib carriers responsible for the emission at 6.75 and 15 @xmath0 m are heated preferentially by hot , massive stars .",
    "this is also confirmed by the good morphological correspondance between the peaks of the emission at 6.75 and 15 @xmath0 m and the h@xmath40 images of some nearby , bright well  resolved late  type galaxies ( sauvage et al .",
    "1996 , boselli & lequeux 1997 ) .",
    "however these dust grains and uib carriers can also be heated by the visible light of evolved stars if its radiation density is large , as shown for example by the fact that elliptical galaxies with little uv radiation or the bulge of m 31 also exhibit 6.75 and 15 @xmath0 m dust emission ( madden et al . in preparation ; cesarsky d. et al . in preparation ; uchida et al . ,",
    "1997 ) .",
    "however in low - luminosity late  type galaxies boselli et al .",
    "( 1997a ) have shown that the integrated mid  ir emission does not follow the mean uv radiation field : the mid - ir emission of these objects does not increase , and may even decrease for high far - uv fluxes .",
    "figure 7 also shows that for such objects the ratio of the mid - ir flux to the far  ir flux decreases at low k luminosities or small total masses ( and strong far  uv radiation fields ) .",
    "all this points to a lack of very small grains and uib carriers in low - luminosity late  type galaxies , both per unit mass of gas and relative to the big grains that are responsible for the far  ir emission .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this trend .",
    "one can be the effect of metallicity ( sauvage et al .",
    "one expects a lower dust / gas mass ratio for these galaxies since the grains are mostly made of heavy elements , but this does not necessarily imply a lower small grain / large grain ratio .",
    "however such a lower ratio could result from a second  order effect : the lower abundance of carbon with respect to oxygen ( and probably to silicon ) might lower the abundance of carbonaceous grains which are often believed to dominate the mid  ir emission in our galaxy , relative to that of silicate grains which are less efficient emitters ( see e.g. dwek et al . 1997 ) .",
    "then the overall mid ",
    "ir emission will decrease with respect to the far  ir one which is believed to be always dominated by silicates .",
    "the other possible interpretation of the low mid ",
    "ir / far  ir emission ratio has been proposed by boulanger et al .",
    "( 1988 ) who suggested that in radiation fields larger than @xmath1 50 times that in the solar neighborhood up to 80 % of the grains emitting in the mid  ir can be destroyed by uv photons .",
    "such a high radiation field exists in large fractions of the volume of the dwarf galaxies with k @xmath34 10 mag .",
