    "in the present paper we analyze the classic problem of discrete mathematics that is minimization of a quadratic functional depending on the great number @xmath1 of binary variables @xmath3 : @xmath4 this problem arises in a lot of scientific fields of knowledge beginning from physics of magnetic materials and neural networks up to analysis of results of physical experiments and logistics .",
    "usually the connection matrix @xmath5 is supposed to be symmetric one with zero diagonal elements : @xmath6 .",
    "the state of the system as a whole is given by @xmath1-dimensional vector @xmath7 .",
    "such vectors will be called _ configuration vectors _ or simply _",
    "configurations_. the characteristic @xmath8 that has to be minimized will be called _ the energy _ of the state , and the configuration providing the global minimum of the functional ( 1 ) will be called _ the ground state_.    in general the number of local minima of the functional ( 1 ) is exponentially large .",
    "practically all minimization algorithms guarantee finding of a local minimum only .",
    "the exceptions are very rare and , as a rule , they are relied on specific properties of the connection matrix @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the most widespread is the _ random minimization _ @xcite . according this algorithm the spin dynamics",
    "is started from a random configuration . in randomized order",
    "the states of dissatisfied spins are changed . as a result",
    "the dynamic system step by step falls into the nearest local minimum .",
    "we used just the random minimization in our computer simulations ( section 3 ) .",
    "very little is known about properties of the energy surface of the functional ( 1 ) , namely , about the number and the structure of the set of local minima , about the ground state and the probability to find it and so on .",
    "in fact there is only one nontrivial connection matrix for which the ground state of the functional ( 1 ) can be indicated exactly .",
    "this is the hebb matrix in the case when the value of the loading parameter @xmath9 is small : @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "then the global minimum of the functional ( 1 ) is achieved at any of @xmath11 random patterns .    due to discrete character of the problem",
    "its theoretical analysis is very rare . from recent results",
    "let us point out the papers @xcite , @xcite , where the authors succeeded in connecting the depth of the local minimum with the probability of its random finding , and also described some characteristics of the energy surface .    in our work",
    "we introduce a class of _ additive matrices _ whose elements are pair - wise sums of a set of predetermined numbers @xmath12 : @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the kronecker delta symbol .    the additive matrices generalize a special class of hebb s matrices analyzed in @xcite . for the functional ( 1 ) with the connection matrix ( 2 ) the ground state can be obtained exactly .",
    "we succeeded in presentation additive matrices in the form when the dependence of the ground state on external parameters of the problem can be described analytically .",
    "when the ground state is known , interesting results can be obtained with the aid of computer simulation . in the next section we present the theory relating to the problem . in section 3",
    "we give the results of computer simulations .",
    "it can be verified directly that for an additive matrix ( 2 ) the value of the functional ( 1 ) is equal to @xmath15 here @xmath16 is @xmath1-dimensional vector whose coordinates are @xmath12 , and @xmath17 is the `` bisector '' of the principal orthant of the space @xmath18 . from minimization of the functional ( 3 )",
    "one can pass to _ maximization _ of the functional    @xmath19    let us denote by @xmath20 _ the class _ of all configurations @xmath21 for which exactly @xmath22 coordinates are equal `` -1 '' : @xmath23 the class @xmath20 consists of @xmath24 configurations .",
    "for all these configurations the first multiplier in the expression ( 4 ) takes the same value @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , to maximize ( 4 ) _ among configurations from the class _ @xmath20 , it is sufficient to find a vector @xmath26 maximizing the scalar product @xmath27 .",
    "this problem is not so difficult ( see item 3 ) .",
    "suppose , we can find the vector @xmath28 maximizing the scalar product @xmath27 in the class @xmath29 .",
    "let us denote this vector as @xmath30 , and let the value of the functional ( 4 ) for this vector be @xmath31 : @xmath32 when finding all these vectors @xmath30 ( @xmath33 ) , it is easy to find the global maximum of the functional ( 4 ) , since the functional reaches its maximal value on one of the vectors @xmath30 .",
    "note we do not need to compare between themselves all @xmath34 numbers @xmath35 , but the first half of them only .",
    "the reason is that for any @xmath22 the classes @xmath36 and @xmath37 are inversion of each other : @xmath38 . since for any configuration @xmath28 the equality @xmath39 is fulfilled , we obtain that @xmath40 for all values of @xmath22 . combining the cases of even and odd @xmath1 in one formula",
    "we obtain that to find the global maximum of the functional ( 4 ) it is necessary to find the largest of the values @xmath41 , when @xmath42 $ ] : @xmath43.\\ ] ]    * 3 . * without loss of generality the numbers @xmath44 can be put in order according their increase : @xmath45 let us take any @xmath46 .",
    "it is easy to see that the scalar product @xmath47 reaches its maximum inside the class @xmath29 when the configuration vector is @xmath48 indeed , @xmath49 where @xmath50    let @xmath28 be another configuration vector from the class @xmath20 for which numbers of negative coordinates @xmath51 dose not take the first places .",
    "the scalar product @xmath47 is equal to @xmath52 , and inequality @xmath53 is fulfilled since @xmath54 for any set of indices @xmath55 that differs from @xmath56 .",
    "thus , under the condition of ordering ( 5 ) , to find the global minimum of the functional ( 3 ) it is necessary to find the largest among the numbers @xmath57,\\eqno(8)\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are given in eq.(7 ) .",
    "* 4 . * the initial problem ( 1)-(2 ) can be considered as solved : the expressions ( 6 ) restrict the set of configurations among which the ground state of the functional ( 2 ) should be found . to define",
    "which configuration is the ground state it is necessary to calculate @xmath60 numbers ( 8) and find the largest among them .",
    "it reminds unclear under which conditions this or that configuration ( 6 ) would be the ground state . if any of them will be the ground state or not ?",
    "it turned out that these questions can be answered .    without loss of generality let us suppose that the numbers @xmath12 have a special form : @xmath61,\\ t \\ge 0.\\eqno(9)\\ ] ] in this presentation the values @xmath62 are positive numbers from the unit interval , and the positive parameter @xmath63 can take an arbitrary value .",
    "it is not difficult to see that from the point of view of minimization of our functional an arbitrary set of numbers @xmath2 can be reduced to the form ( 9 ) .",
    "for example , let us suppose that @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "then we set @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this means that the numbers @xmath12 have the form ( 9 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "let the initial numbers @xmath68 have different signs and take on arbitrary values : @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "let us normalize these numbers dividing them by @xmath71 : @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "it is clear that the solution of the problem ( 1 ) is the same when we use initial numbers @xmath73 or normalized numbers @xmath12 .",
    "the last numbers can be presented in the form ( 9 ) , if we set @xmath74 and @xmath75 . from our argumentation",
    "it follows that the numbers @xmath12 can always be presented in the form ( 9 ) .",
    "then the following statement is right ( the proof see in the appendix )",
    ".    * theorem .",
    "* when @xmath63 increasing from the initial value @xmath76 , the ground state sequentially coincides with the vectors @xmath30 ( 6 ) in the following order : @xmath77 the jump of the ground state @xmath78 occurs when @xmath63 transfers through the critical value : @xmath79 where analogously of eq.(7 ) @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "when @xmath63 belongs to the interval @xmath82 $ ] , the ground state of the functional is the configuration @xmath30 .",
    "this theorem generalizes the previous results obtained in @xcite .",
    "the theorem describes exhaustively the behavior of the ground state for the problem ( 1)-(2 ) .",
    "depending on the values of external parameters @xmath83 each of the configurations @xmath30 , @xmath84 can turn out to be the ground state of the functional .",
    "for @xmath63 from the interval @xmath82 $ ] the energy of the ground state is the linear function of the parameter @xmath63 . it can be easily seen from the expressions ( 8) substituting the values @xmath2 in the form ( 9 ) : @xmath85 where up to the factor @xmath86 we have : @xmath87     on the parameter @xmath63 for additive matrices of the dimensionality @xmath88 : the upper one is the arithmetical additive matrix , and the lower one is the random matrix ( see the body of the text ) .",
    "the values @xmath89 for the points @xmath90 are marked.,width=384 ]    in fig.1 for @xmath91 it is shown how the energy of the ground state depends on the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "the upper panel corresponds to the case when the values @xmath62 constitute the arithmetical progression : @xmath92 . on the lower panel",
    "the analogous plot is shown for a random additive matrix , when @xmath62 are random numbers from the interval [ 0 , 1 ] . along the abscissa axis",
    "the values of the parameter @xmath63 are shown , along the axis of ordinates we show the energy of the ground state calculated in the points @xmath93 ( 11 ) .",
    "the first value of the parameter @xmath63 for which the energy of the ground state is calculated is equal to zero : @xmath94 . since both plots are very similar , we analyze only one of them ; for example the upper one .",
    "we see that the energy of the ground state is nontrivially depended on the parameter @xmath63 . for small values , @xmath95 ,",
    "very deep minima correspond to the ground state .",
    "then , when @xmath63 increases , the depth of the global minimum decreases very quickly and it reaches a minimal value when @xmath96 . for these values of @xmath63 all matrix elements become negative . during further increase of @xmath63",
    "the depth of the global minimum slowly but steadily increases .",
    "it becomes deeper and deeper .",
    "which properties of the energy surface reflect non - monotone change of the depth of the global minimum ?",
    "what properties are responsible for its minimal depth ? for the time being we can not answer these questions . using formulae ( 10)-(13 ) everyone can be certain of universal character of the curves shown in fig.1 .",
    "up till now we can neither extend these results onto local minima of the functional , nor obtain analytical description of other interesting characteristics such as the number of different minima , distribution of local minima with respect to their depths and distances to the ground state and so on .",
    "however , if the ground state is known , these characteristics can be studied with the aid of computer simulations .",
    "now we turn to presentation of these results .",
    "for given @xmath97 and @xmath98 for each value of @xmath99 we generated an additive matrix .",
    "we did @xmath100 random starts ( see introduction ) and obtained the same number of local minima .",
    "for each minimum we fixed its depth ( the energy@xmath101 ) , the relative hamming distance @xmath102 between the minimum and the ground state and other characteristics .",
    "thus as a result of a great number of random trials for each value of @xmath99 we could estimate : a ) the probability of random finding of the ground state @xmath103 ; b ) the deepest of the obtained minimum and the distance from it to the ground state ; c ) the number of different minima @xmath104 , their distribution over energies and distances from the ground state and so on .",
    "the parameter @xmath99 was varied from zero up to the maximal value @xmath105 . for two dimensionalities @xmath91 and @xmath106 such experiments",
    "were done for both arithmetical and random additive matrices .",
    "the following graphs are shown : on the upper panel is the probability to find the ground state ; on the next panel is the ratio of depth of the deepest found minimum to the depth of the global minimum ; on the next panel is the relative hamming distance between the deepest minimum and the ground state ; on the bottom panel is the number of different energies of local minima.,width=384 ]    in fig.2 for the arithmetical additive matrix of dimensionality @xmath91 the dependence of some of the listed characteristics on the parameter @xmath63 is shown .",
    "let us explain what the graphs shown on different panels of the figure mean .",
    "* on the upper panel * the probability to find the ground state @xmath107 is shown .",
    "we see that in the region of small values of @xmath63 ( @xmath108 ) , where the depth of the global minimum is large , the probability to find the ground state is notably different from zero . on the contrary , in the region of large values of @xmath63 , where the global minimum becomes rather shallow , the probability to find it is equal to zero ( it is less than @xmath109 ) . at the same time it is not important which configuration @xmath30 is the ground state .",
    "apparently , such behavior of the probability @xmath103 is one more confirmation of the law , which was theoretically predicted in @xcite , @xcite : the deeper minimum , the greater probability to find it under the random search .    for the matrix of dimensionality @xmath106 the behavior of the given characteristic is an analogous one .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath63 for which the probability to find the ground state becomes zero , increases up to the value @xmath110 .",
    "* on the second panel from the top * the ratio of the found deepest minimum @xmath111 to the global minimum @xmath112 , @xmath113 , is shown .",
    "this ratio takes on a value from the interval [ 0 , 1 ] . at first , while the ground state still can be found , this ratio is equal to 1",
    ". then in the region of the values @xmath114 this characteristic has a sharp downward excursion , which soon changes to a steady increasing and tends to 1 asymptotically .",
    "the minimal value of this characteristic is @xmath115 .",
    "it shows that in the worst case the objective function is 15% less than the optimal value .    for matrices of dimensionality @xmath106",
    "the behavior of the ratio @xmath113 is absolutely analogous .",
    "the deepest downward excursion of the graph takes place when @xmath110 , and its depth increases noticeably : the minimal value of the ratio is equal @xmath116 . in other words , when the dimensionality of the problem increases the found suboptimal solution will be worse comparing with the global minimum .",
    "note , that for the large values of @xmath117 , when the ratio @xmath113 is close to 1 , the probability to find the ground state as before is equal to 0 .",
    "the same also takes place in the case @xmath118 .",
    "* on the second panel from the bottom * it is shown how the distance @xmath119 between the deepest local minimum and the ground state depends on the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "( by the distance we understand the relative hamming distance @xmath120 $ ] . )    at first , while the ground state still can be found this distance is equal to 0 ( see the beginning of the graph ) .",
    "then in the interval of the `` worst '' values of @xmath121 the distance @xmath119 increases sharply up to the value @xmath122 .",
    "after that the distance between the deepest local minimum and the ground state is stabilized near the value @xmath123 .",
    "let us add that for additive matrices of dimensionality @xmath124 suboptimal solution is far away from the ground state .",
    "this distance is @xmath125 .",
    "the general conclusion is as follows : for rather large values of @xmath121 , when as a result of the random search it is possible to find suboptimal solution only , this solution is sufficiently far from the ground state .",
    "however , the ratio of the minima depths @xmath113 can be of order of 1 ( in fig.2 this situation corresponds to the values of @xmath126 ) .",
    "this combination of properties is possible only if the energy surface consists of a large number of local minima , which depths not strongly differ one from each other and from the global minimum .",
    "we may conclude , that for large values of @xmath121 , when elements of connection matrix are large negative numbers , the construction of the energy surface is as aforesaid .    * on the bottom panel * we show the dependence of the number of different energies of local minima @xmath104 on the value of the parameter @xmath63 . as a rule",
    "each energy is many times degenerated . to estimate the number of different local minima it is necessary to analyze how many different configurations correspond to the same energy",
    "nevertheless , such characteristic as the number of energy levels is also of interest .    for an arithmetical additive matrix of the dimensionality @xmath91 the maximal value of the characteristic @xmath104",
    "is reached in the region @xmath127 .",
    "this maximum is comparatively small , @xmath128 .",
    "however , it turns out that each energy is many times degenerated , and the number of different local minima is an orders of magnitude greater . for a random additive matrix of the same dimensionality the maximal value of the characteristic @xmath129 is equal to tens of thousands ( the graph is not presented ) .    for the additive matrices of the dimensionality @xmath106 the general form of the graph of the characteristic",
    "@xmath104 is analogous . in this case",
    "the maximal value , @xmath130 , is reached in the region @xmath131 . since for each @xmath63",
    "only @xmath100 random starts have been done , this means that each second start leads the system into new local minimum . in other words , for middle values of @xmath63 the number of local minima is very big .",
    "for additive matrices the method of finding of the global minimum of the quadratic binary functional is pointed out .",
    "we propose the @xmath63 -parametrization of additive matrices that allows one to get an exhaustive classification for all variants possible for the ground state .    for not great values of @xmath63 ( let us say for @xmath132 $ ] ) among matrix elements there are positive as well as negative ones ; or all elements are negative , but they are small in modulus . in this case",
    "the depth of the global minimum is very big . here",
    "the probability to find the ground state in random search is rather high : @xmath133 .",
    "it can be supposed that in this case the energy surface has a small number of local minima whose depths noticeably less then the depth of the global minimum .    on the contrary , for the great values of @xmath63",
    "all matrix elements are negative and they are big in modulus . in this case",
    "it is practically impossible to find the ground state with the aid of the random minimization , since the probability to get into the global minimum is negligible small .",
    "apparently in this case the energy surface contains very large number of local minima that only slightly differ from each other in depths . here",
    "the global minimum is only insignificantly deeper than local minima . varying the value of the parameter @xmath63 it is possible to get over from one type of the energy surface to the other one .",
    "so , additive matrices are good models for examining the energy surfaces in the general case .    by this time",
    "additive matrices for large values of @xmath63 can be used for testing of new algorithms of the quadratic binary minimization .",
    "indeed , on the one hand , with the aid of the formulae ( 10)-(13 ) the ground state always can be found . on the other hand , for large values of the parameter @xmath63",
    "it is practically impossible to find the ground state with the aid of the random minimization .",
