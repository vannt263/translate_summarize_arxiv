    "theoretical and observational investigations of solar metallicity g and k giants have led to broad agreement about the changes in surface composition arising from the first dredge - up initiated by the deep convective envelope of the giant .",
    "principal effects are a drastic lowering of the li abundance , a reduction of the @xmath0c abundance , a lowering of the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio and an increase of the @xmath2n abundance with a preservation of the sum of @xmath0c , @xmath1c , and @xmath2n nuclides .    rare examples of g and k giants exhibiting startling departures from the broad agreement shared by the vast majority of the stars highlight the fact that facets of the evolution of these stars from birth to the giant branch have eluded theoretical understanding . weak g band stars ( here , wk gb stars ) are just such a class of exceptional stars .",
    "the discovery of the first of these stars showing weak ch molecular lines in the fraunhofer g band was made by bidelman ( 1951 ) who examined low - resolution spectra of hr885 and remarked ` the spectrum is extraordinarily peculiar , with the line spectrum matching fairly well g5 iii but with no trace of cn or ch absorption ' . a quantitative analysis from coud spectra",
    "was undertaken by greenstein & keenan ( 1958 ) who not only found both ch and cn deficient by about 2 dex but uncovered a second wk gb star  hr6791  with less extreme ch and cn deficiencies .",
    "bidelman & macconnell ( 1973 ) laid the groundwork for an extensive abundance analysis of wk gb stars with a search of objective prism plates aimed at finding ` the brighter stars of astrophysical interest ' which provided a list of 34 stars with ` weak or no g band ' .",
    "the survey forming the basis for the list was focused on the southern hemisphere and , hence , did not include either hr885 or hr6791 .",
    "although the 1973 paper has been followed by several papers discussing aspects of quantitative abundance analyses of wk gb stars , there has , apart from determinations of the li abundance , been no comprehensive analysis of elements and isotopes ( i.e. , c , n , and o in particular ) which should be useful diagnostics of the causes of the weak g band phenomenon .",
    "notably , ( 2012 ) in their compilation of published abundances for 28 wk g band stars list li abundances for 18 stars but c and n abundances for just four stars and o abundances for only two stars ( taken from sneden et  al .",
    "1978 , cottrell & norris 1978 , and day 1980 ) .",
    "the principal aim of our paper is to provide the first thorough abundance analyses of a complete sample of the wk gb stars accessible to us at the w.j .",
    "mcdonald observatory in texas .",
    "our focus is on the determination of the li , c , n , and o abundances and the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio but other elements from na to eu are also included .",
    "such data are considered by us to be a prerequisite to a discussion of likely origins of this class of peculiar red giants . of the variety of origins proposed in the literature",
    ", none seems to account convincingly for the reported abundance data .",
    "we observed 24 wk gb stars with the 2.7 m harlan j. smith telescope at the mcdonald observatory .",
    "the telescope was equipped with the robert g. tull cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph ( tull et  al . 1995 ) and a tektronix 2048x2048 pixel ccd detector .",
    "a majority of the stars was observed with two different setups of the tull spectrograph .",
    "the pair when combined provide coverage of the inter - order echelle gaps .",
    "the _ blue _",
    "setup was centered on 5112in order 68 , while the _ red _ setup is centered on 5178(order 68 ) .",
    "a few stars were observed in what we deem the standard ( std ) setup centered on 5060in order 69 .",
    "for all setups a wavelength range of 390010000was covered with a resolving power of @xmath3 .",
    "the observations are listed in table [ tab : observations ] .",
    "the spectra were reduced in a multiple step procedure .",
    "first flat field and bias corrections were applied .",
    "then the echelle spectra were extracted and wavelength calibrated using thar - lamp comparison exposures taken before or after the observations .",

    "the parameters of the program stars were derived by spectroscopic means using fei and feii lines .",
    "the line selection process included the comparison of different line lists and atomic data .",
    "the original line list composed for this purpose contained about 280 fei and 25 feii lines that we identified in the wk gb spectra by comparison with the solar atlas .",
    "values for the @xmath16values of these lines were taken from nist , the kurucz database ( kurucz & bell 1995 ) , and & barbuy ( 2009 ) . the line equivalent widths ( ews ) were measured with an _ automatic routine for line equivalent widths in stellar spectra _ ( _ ares _ , 2007 ) .",
    "lines not found , or not identified as single lines by _ ares _ , were removed from the list . as a next step ,",
    "the measured ews were plotted against the strength of the lines , i.e. roughly the difference of @xmath16and excitation potential @xmath17 , in order to identify and remove lines , which deviate too strongly from the linear trend .",
    "the resulting line list was then used as input for the spectral synthesis code _ moog _ ( sneden 1973 ) for an abundance analysis .",
    "we made use of input model atmospheres , which were interpolated from a grid of models from castelli & kurucz ( 2004 ) . assuming a one - dimensional , plane - parallel atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , the abundances of the computed lines were force - fitted to match the measured ews .",
    "the derived abundances were plotted vs. the excitation potential of the lines and any trend was flattened by adjusting the effective temperature ( @xmath18 ) of the model atmosphere .",
    "simultaneously , the microturbulence was derived by reducing the trend in the plot of fe abundances and reduced equivalent width ( ew divided by wavelength ) .",
    "the surface gravity was adjusted until abundances derived by fei and feii lines matched within 0.12 dex , which for most of the stars corresponds to the standard deviation of the feii abundance . since all parameters are to some extent interdependent , usually several iterations are needed . in order to minimize the error of the @xmath18determination , the line list was iteratively cleaned of fei and feii lines that showed significant deviations in their abundances compared to the derived average abundance of their species .",
    "this was done until the resulting @xmath19 for the abundance determination was reduced to @xmath20 0.05 .",
    "nlte effects that could affect the determination of fe abundances and stellar parameters are negligible for g and k stars in our metallicity range ( bergemann et  al .",
    "2011 , 2011 ) .",
    "we repeated the procedure for the line lists presented in ramrez & allende prieto ( 2011 ) and takeda , sato , & murata ( 2008 ) .",
    "the former consists of 37 fei and 9 feii lines with @xmath16values from different sources ( e.g the oxford group and allende prieto , lambert , & asplund 2002 , most references can be found in lambert et  al .",
    "1996 ) and was compiled for the determination of the iron abundance of arcturus .",
    "the latter includes 124 fei and 11 feii lines with excitation potential and @xmath16values from & sauval ( 1999 ) , and was used for the determination of stellar parameters of late - g giants .",
    "effective temperatures derived with the line list from ramrez & allende prieto ( 2011 ) agree with the temperatures that were derived with our original large line list . the scatter is less than @xmath21 .",
    "the logarithms of the surface gravities agree within @xmath22 .",
    "the microturbulence derived with the ramrez & allende prieto ( 2011 ) line list is on average higher by about @xmath23 , the metallicity lower by about 0.15dex .    the temperatures derived with the takeda et  al .",

    "the atomic data for the lines that our original list and ramrez & allende prieto ( 2011 ) have in common is almost identical , with differences in the @xmath16values of @xmath26 .",
    "the small discrepancy in the derived parameters is therefore probably a result of the line selection itself .",
    "a higher number of lines of a certain excitation potential could have statistical influence on the observed trend of abundance with @xmath17 . to test the influence of the number of lines included in a line list , we randomly chose a subset of lines from our original list and repeated the parameter determination .",
    "the results , however , did not vary significantly .",
    "we decided to compile a final line list out of the line list from takeda et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) and ramrez & allende prieto ( 2011 ) and include the lines of & barbuy ( 2009 ) for additional feii line data .",
    "the kurucz loggf values are computed and might therefore be less accurate .",
    "the line lists of takeda et al . and ramrez & allende prieto are compiled and tested for giant stars and include reliable loggf values .",

    "the spectroscopic ( sp . )",
    "parameters derived with this line list can be found in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the uncertainties for the temperatures can be estimated from different sources . since we typically derived two temperatures for every star , corresponding to the different observing setups ( see section [ sect : observations ] ) , we take the difference between both derived temperatures as a statistical error . this error is @xmath27 .",
    "in cases where only one setup was available we assume this error to be 50k . for each setup we determined an additional error by varying the temperature and investigating the impact on the slope of the trend between fei abundances and excitation potential .",
    "varying the temperature by more than 50k results in a difference in the fe abundances of lines with low and high excitation potential that is larger than the @xmath28 error derived for the fe abundance with no trend .",
    "we take this as our instrinsic error . adding both errors results in a mean error for the spectroscopic temperatures of 90k ( see table [ tab : parameters ] ) .    for the spectroscopic gravities we estimate a mean error of 0.18dex from the different gravities derived for each star with the different setups .",
    "the metallicities in table [ tab : parameters ] are calculated as the mean value of fei and feii abundances , minus the solar fe abundance of ( 2009 ) , @xmath29 , ] of all setups that were available for a star .",
    "the quoted errors are derived by taking into account the standard deviation of these abundances and the errors for the individual abundance determinations . in cases where only one setup was available we assume an error of 0.1 for the missing abundances .      to check that our line list gives accurate results for the @xmath18of our objects we employed additional methods to determine their temperatures . as described in gray & brown ( 2001 ) , line depth ratios ( ldrs ) of certain elements",
    "are excellent indicators of stellar temperatures for g and k giants .",
    "measuring the depth of temperature sensitive vi lines and comparing them to close - by nii , sii and fei lines , provides a good tool to constrain the temperatures of the stars .",
    "gray & brown ( 2001 ) calibrated the ldrs against the ( b - v ) color index and applied corrections for metallicity and absolute - magnitude variations .",
    "the ( b - v ) colors were then converted into temperatures using the temperature scale of ( 1999 ) .",
    "we use our spectroscopically derived metallicities and parallaxes from the new _ hipparcos _ reduction of ( 2007 ) for the metallicity and absolute - magnitude corrections .    our temperatures determined by the ldrs measured in the wk gb stars are in excellent agreement with our spectroscopically derived temperatures , the mean difference being 13k .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the dependence on an original effective temperature scale limits the accuracy of the determination of absolute temperatures derived by the ldr measurements .",
    "nevertheless , the ranking of the stars according to their relative temperatures is not affected and also agrees well with the temperature sequence found for our spectroscopic temperatures ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "for some stars no ldr temperatures could be derived due to different reasons . for the stars with imprecisely known parallaxes ,",
    "no correction for absolute - magnitude variations could be made . for 37com , hd67728 , and hr1023 , strong line broadening caused difficulties for the ldr measurement .",
    "the ldr method depends on a low @xmath30 and these three stars are rapid rotators .",
    "however , for all stars with measured ldrs the derived temperatures confirm our spectroscopic result and justify our particular choice of line list .",

    "( 2010 ) present spectroscopic temperatures for 25 k giants .",
    "we determined photometric temperatures for their objects and find that the spectroscopic temperatures are higher by about 80k .",
    "these comparisons show that higher spectroscopic temperatures are not specific to the wk gb stars .",
    "their main characteristic , the weak absorption at wavelengths around 4300 , might affect single colors only ( mainly b , and the 42 filter of the ddo system ) .",
    "however , the higher flux in these filters would only increase the photometrically derived temperatures , and thus , minimize the difference between the temperatures .",
    "it should be noted that the differences in the temperatures derived with the different methods presented here are not critical to the analysis and results described in the following sections .",
    "the differences in the derived abundances ( see sections [ sect : carbon]-[sect : otherelements ] ) are subtle and do not affect the overall conclusions derived in these sections and discussed in sections [ sect : discussion ] and [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "we estimated the reddening of our stars similar to the procedure described in luck & heiter ( 2007 ) .",
    "first we calculate the reddening of our stars with the extinct code provided by hakkila et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using the position of our objects and the distances calculated from the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes as input .",
    "then we subtract the reddening calculated for a distance of 75pc accounting for the reddening - free local bubble .",
    "most of our objects are not affected by reddening . over 50% of the sample stars have a reddening lower than @xmath33 which corresponds to a change in @xmath18of @xmath34 for the ( b - v ) colors .",
    "the determination of the reddening in most of the other cases suffers from uncertain parallaxes and large errors in the determined total visual extinction , sometimes far exceeding the actual values .",
    "we therefore continue under the assumption that reddening is negligible .",
    "we calculated luminosities for the program stars with the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes and the gcpd visual magnitudes and their errors .",
    "in the cases where no v magnitude or error estimate was available in the gcpd we take magnitudes and errors from the nomad catalogue .",
    "we applied a bolometric correction according to ( 1999 ) . using both spectroscopic and photometric temperatures we derived the position of the stars in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) .",
    "for some of the stars the errors in the parallaxes are large .",
    "figure [ fig : f2 ] shows the location of the wk gb stars in the hrd and evolutionary tracks from ( 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "the errors of the parallaxes of some of our objects are large . we therefore only plot objects with parallax errors smaller than 75% of the actual parallax .",
    "depending on the set of temperatures used , the positions of the objects lead to different conclusions .",
    "while the hotter spectroscopic temperatures place the objects at positions at the beginning of the giant branch ascent , the photometric temperatures indicate a more advanced evolution .",
    "it is apparent that for the region in the hrd where the wk gb stars can be found , the exact placement of the stars depends critically on the temperature .",

    "after a few preliminaries , it is this aspect which we discuss in the next section .",
    "one of the preliminary remarks concerns the [ fe / h ] distributions of our and luck & heiter s sample .",
    "these are compared in figure [ fig : f12 ] and show that the wk gb stars have a higher proportion of low [ fe / h ] stars ( say , [ fe / h ] @xmath104 ) than do the nearby giants which luck & heiter show have the same distribution as the nearby dwarfs ( luck & heiter 2006 ) with both giant and dwarf distributions having mean values [ fe / h ] @xmath105 .",
    "in contrast , the wk gb sample has a mean value @xmath106 = -0.23 $ ] .",
    "unless the search for wk gb stars was concentrated more heavily on metal - poor giants , this result implies that production of wk gb stars is more readily accomplished among metal - poor stars .",
    "a second preliminary remark concerns the stellar masses .",
    "the normal giants run from about 1@xmath107to about 3@xmath107with the majority of stars falling between 1 and 2@xmath107(luck & heiter 2007 ) .",
    "in contrast , the trigonometrical parallaxes and effective temperatures place the masses of our wk gb sample ( see above ) between 2.5@xmath107and about 5@xmath107 , i.e. , our stars are what are usually referred to as intermediate mass stars and the nearby stars are low mass stars .",
    "this mass difference translates to differences in the evolution of the stars , e.g. , low mass but not intermediate mass stars experience a he - core flash .",
    "but a more significant difference may be the differing distributions of rotational velocity . as kraft ( 1967 ) showed , the mean rotational velocity declines from high values on the upper upper main sequence stars ( @xmath108 ) to low values on the lower main sequence .",
    "thus , the wk gb stars may have left the main sequence as rapid rotators but the majority of luck & heiter s sample of giants departed the main sequence as slow rotators .",
    "if rapid rotation of an intermediate mass star is responsible for the creation of a wk gb star , one may wonder why such a small minority of intermediate mass main sequence stars evolve to wk g stars .",
    "the third preliminary remark concerns the signatures of the h - burning , by the cn - cycle and possibly the on - cycles .",
    "all normal giant stars are expected to have experienced the first dredge - up which brought mildly cn - cycled material into their atmosphere .",
    "low mass stars may have also experienced additional mixing at the luminosity bump on the red giant branch or , perhaps , at the he - core flash .",
    "luck & heiter s sample includes stars on the red giant branch ( pre - he - core flash ) and stars at the red clump ( post - he - core flash ) . intermediate mass giants experience first and second dredge - up but not the he - core flash .",
    "signatures of the addition of mildly cn - cycled material to an atmosphere include a slight reduction of @xmath0c , increase of @xmath1c , increase of @xmath2n with the constraint that the sum @xmath0c+@xmath1c+@xmath2n is conserved . in the first dredge - up for low mass stars ,",
    "the @xmath52o abundance is not changed measurably .",
    "changes of the @xmath53o and @xmath54o abundance are expected .",
    "it is unfortunate that these two heavier o isotopes are not accessible from optical spectra . in the absence of production by the cameron - fowler mechanism",
    ", the atmosphere s li abundance will be lowered severely .",
    "these predictions are confirmed by luck & heiter s sample , as they noted . in particular , comparison of results for nearby dwarfs and giants",
    "showed c in the giants was lowered by about 0.2 dex , n was increased in giants over levels seen in dwarfs such that the c+n sum was conserved , and o abundances among dwarfs and giants were similar .",
    "( the spectral coverage did not allow luck & heiter to determine the carbon isotopic ratio but results in the literature show that the ratio is lowered in giants in qualitative , if not quantitative , agreement with expectation . )",
    "carbon and nitrogen abundances for wk gb and normal giants are compared in figure [ fig : f13 ] with the left - hand panel presenting our results and the right - hand panel showing results for nearby normal giants from luck & heiter ( 2007 ) .    a direct way to examine the assertion that the wk gb stars are unusually rich in cn - cycled material is to plot in figure [ fig : f13 ] the c and n abundances versus [ fe / h ] for the wk gb stars ( left - hand lower panel ) and normal nearby giants ( right - hand lower panel ) .",
    "the contrast between the two samples is striking : the wk gb stars are about a factor of 20 underabundant in c relative to normal giants .",
    "additionally the sum of c and n ( here c is the sum of @xmath0c and @xmath1c ) is about 0.3 dex greater on average for wk gb stars than for the nearby giants over a common range in [ fe / h ] .",
    "a possible explanation for this difference is that , in addition to excessive cn - cycling , some @xmath52o has been processed to @xmath2n through partial on - cycling .",
    "the fact that the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratios are very low is also evidence for cn - cycling .    in terms of the c and n abundances",
    ", there appears a clean distinction between normal and wk gb giants .",
    "this , however , may be an artefact because the discovery of wk gb stars has come almost entirely from visual inspection of low dispersion spectra .",
    "the star with a seemingly intermediate c abundance is hd120171 ( see section [ sect : oxygen ] ) .",
    "lithium in normal giants is generally severely depleted , as predicted because the giant s convective envelope dilutes the lithium that has survived in the main sequence star , the giant s progenitor .",
    "this dilution is illustrated in the right - hand panel of figure [ fig : f14 ] where li abundances for luck & heiter s giants are contrasted with li abundances for dwarfs from lambert & reddy ( 2004 ) .",
    "the non - lte li abundances for wk gb stars ( table [ tab : cno ] ) span the range from the interstellar abundance ( @xmath109 , the star s likely initial li abundance , to severely depleted abundances ( see also left - hand panel of figure [ fig : f14 ] for a comparison of wk gb lte abundances with normal giants and dwarfs ) .",
    "the most direct interpretations of this 1000-fold minimum spread in li abundances is that li dilution by the giant s convective envelope is in some cases offset by internal synthesis of li to an extent that varies greatly from star - to - star despite comparable degrees of contamination by cn - cycle products .      to unravel the links between the composition of wk gb stars and their origins",
    "calls for  first  dissection of the nuclear processes to which their atmospheres has been exposed and  second  identification of the mechanism responsible for transport of the products of these nuclear processes from their site of operation to the stellar atmosphere .",
    "a high n / c ratio and a low @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio are the principal signatures that h - burning cn - cycle products now contaminate a wk gb star s atmosphere . in parallel with the cn - cycle ,",
    "the slower on - cycles and the nena- and mgal - chains may run with observable consequences . finally , lithium production by the cameron & fowler ( 1971 ) mechanism converts available @xmath110he via @xmath48be to @xmath48li . since the atmospheric li abundance depends greatly on the efficiency of transfer of the @xmath48be and @xmath48li to low temperatures in order to avoid destruction by protons , prediction of a wk gb",
    "star s li abundance is fraught with uncertainty .",
    "given that the @xmath49he reservoir is potentially capable of synthesizing li to levels far greater than are observed in wk gb stars , it is intriguing that the maximum observed li abundance is coincident with the interstellar li abundance - see lambert & sawyer ( 1984 ) for a speculative interpretation of this fact .",
    "lithium in the rare examples of li - rich ( normal ) giants can exceed the interstellar abundance by a factor of several ( & balachandran 2000 ; kumar , reddy , & lambert 2011 ) .",
    "thus , little weight should be given the above coincidence .",
    "in contrast to the case of lithium , the relative abundances from the h - burning cycles and chains are predictable with fair certainty from nucleosynthetic arguments , even if aspects of the stellar evolutionary context remain murky .",
    "consumption of protons by the ( slow ) cn - cycle converts four protons to an @xmath103-particle and , after a few cycles , establishes equilibrium abundances of the participating nuclides : @xmath0c , @xmath1c , @xmath2n and @xmath111n with broadly @xmath0c/@xmath1c @xmath112 , @xmath2n/@xmath0c @xmath113 100 , and @xmath2n/@xmath111n @xmath114 20,000 at the temperatures of efficient h - burning . before presenting a semi - quantitative interpretation of the wk gb star cno abundances",
    ", one may note that the abundances ( table 4 ) mirror the above estimates : the n / c ratio is about 100 , and the carbon isotopic ratio is 3 - 4 for many stars .",
    "two boundary prerequisites for the preeminence of the cn - cycle must be recognized .",
    "first , the cn - cycle is in competition for protons with the @xmath115-chains .",
    "the on - cycles process protons more slowly than the cn - cycle and , thus , there is a possibility that the cn - cycle and the @xmath115-chain will complete the conversion of h to he before the on - cycles will have had time to imprint their effect on the cno abundances .",
    "our evaluation of these two conditions is made for a typical wk gb star with [ fe / h ] @xmath116 and initial cno abundances ( i.e. , in the progenitor dwarf ) of approximately c = 8.2 , n = 7.5 and o = 8.6 . ] nuclear reaction rates are taken from the nacre compilation ( angulo et  al .",
    "1999 ) ; recent updates ( adelberger et  al .",
    "2011 ) are unimportant for what follows .",
    "the relative efficiencies of the @xmath115-chains and the cn - cycle in consuming protons are set by the slowest rate for each process : @xmath117 for the @xmath115-chain and @xmath2n(@xmath118o for the cn - cycle .",
    "as is well known , the @xmath115-chains are the principal consumer of protons at ` low ' temperatures and the cn - cycle at ` high ' temperatures . for n = 7.8 ,",
    "the consumption rates are equal at about 20 million degrees .",
    "thanks to the coulomb barrier between the @xmath2n and the proton , the @xmath115-chain rapidly outperforms the cn - cycle as the temperature is lowered below 20 million degrees ; for example , the @xmath115-chain is favored by a factor of @xmath119 at 10 million degrees .",
    "thus , the cn - cycled material present in a wk gb star was processed at temperatures of 20 million degrees or hotter .",
    "the on - cycles consume protons more slowly than the cn - cycle and are unlikely to achieve their equilibrium abundances .",
    "flow through the on - cycles is controlled by the ratio of the reaction rates @xmath111n@xmath120c which closes the cn - cycle and @xmath111n@xmath121o which opens the on - cycles .",
    "this ratio reflecting the relative strengths of the strong to the electromagnetic interaction favors closure of the cn - cycle by a factor of about 1000 .",
    "however , in advance of the on - cycles reaching equilibrium , some @xmath52o is converted to @xmath2n via @xmath53o .",
    "the temperature - dependent cn - cycle equilibrium ratio for n / c may be increased by n from o consumption as @xmath52o is processed to @xmath2n ahead of equilibrium within the on - cycles .",
    "given this contrast between the times for completion of the cn- and on - cycles , one may note two reasons for expecting the cn - cycle products in a wk gb stellar atmosphere not to be accompanied by on - cycle equilibrium products which are @xmath52o - poor and @xmath2n - rich .",
    "first , the episode of h - burning may not be active for the length of time required to run the on - cycle yet able to run the cn - cycle to equilibrium .",
    "second , protons may be totally consumed by the cn - cycle before the on - cycle achieves equilibrium .",
    "for example , for our typical wk gb star with c+n = 8.3 and h / c = 3.7 and four protons consumed per cn - cycle , 1200 ( = @xmath122 ) cycles exhaust the proton supply which would indicate that the on - cycle being a factor of 1000 slower than the cn - cycle will be largely idle .",
    "( at much lower metallicities when the number of c+n catalysts is lower , the cn - cycle must run more cycles to exhaust the protons and , then , o - poor ( and c - poor ) but very n - rich stars may be anticipated . )",
    "a corollary deserves comment .",
    "if the on - cycle has operated in the material mixed into the atmosphere , the atmosphere will become h - poor and he - rich but the wk gb stars are obviously not extremely he - rich .",
    "an accurate determination of their he / h ratio is an elusive goal .",
    "now consider the typical wk gb star with initial abundances c = 8.2 , n = 7.5 , and o= 8.6 or n / c = -0.7 and n / o = -1.1 .",
    "suppose the atmosphere is mixed with a large amount of cn - cycled material , the atmospheric composition tends to equilibrium abundances of the cycle .",
    "then , the n / c becomes 2.1 , 1.9 and 1.6 for temperatures t@xmath123 = 20 , 30 and 50 , respectively , with n / o = @xmath124 for these temperatures . is @xmath125 t k. ] in figure [ fig : f15 ] , we show n / o versus n / c . with the exceptions of 37com and hr1023 having high n / c and n / o , and hd120171 with its high c and low n abundances ,",
    "the wk gb stars fall in a slanted rectangle centered on about n / o @xmath126 and n / c @xmath127 .",
    "the predicted n / cs cross the slanted rectangle but the n / o ratio does not : n / o = @xmath124 is predicted but the stars span the range 0.0 to @xmath1280.6 .",
    "one way to raise the n / o ratio is to assume that the on - cycles have partially converted @xmath52o to @xmath2n in the run up to the never attained condition of on - cycle equilibrium .",
    "suppose that at t@xmath123 = 30 the o abundance was depleted from 8.6 to 8.4 , then n / o = 0.2 and n / c = 2.2 which combination falls within the rectangle ( open circle in figure [ fig : f15 ] ) .",
    "there is evidence for a star - to - star variation in o depletion . in figure",
    "[ fig : f16 ] , we compare [ o / fe ] for wk gb stars and normal giants with a line corresponding to a fit to the latter results . if o depletion is the explanation for the n / o discrepancy , there will be a correlation between the o deficiency as shown in figure [ fig : f16 ] by the amount that [ o / fe ] falls below the line defined by the normal giants ( say , @xmath129[o / fe ] ) and the n / o ratio .",
    "figure [ fig : f17 ] shows the @xmath129[o / fe ] versus n / o relation with the majority of points exhibiting a loose correlation of the expected sign .",
    "there are four outliers : 37com , hr1023 , hd132776 with high n abundances and hd120171 with a low o abundance but not the anticipated n overabundance .",
    "hd67728 with a large negative @xmath129[o / fe ] ( @xmath130 ) may also be an outlier .",
    "if the cn - cycle supplemented by partial operation of the on - cycles has occurred , a sum rule operates , i.e. , the sum of initial c , n , and o nuclei is conserved .",
    "this rule may be checked using the nearby giants to define the initial sum .",
    "figure [ fig : f18 ] shows the cno sum versus [ fe / h ] for wk gb stars and the nearby giants . apart from two outliers among the wk gb stars ( 37com and hr1023 for 37com and & mayor ( 1999 ) give @xmath131 for hr1023 . ] ) , the sum for the wk gb stars may be somewhat systematically greater than for the nearby giants ; the upper envelope for the wk gb stars is approximately 0.1dex greater than for nearby giants of a similar metallicity . perhaps , figure [ fig : f18 ] gives an impression that the cno sums for some wk gb stars maybe greater than for nearby giants .",
    "this is contrary to expectation for contamination of wk gb atmospheres by cno - cycled material , casts doubt on the proposal that on - cycled material is present in some wk gb stellar atmospheres , and directs suspicion to systematic effects in the abundance analysis .",
    "this suspicion should likely be directed at the c abundances which were derived from different spectral signature for the two samples ( see section 4.1 ) : the ch g - band for wk gb stars and ci lines and a c@xmath58 feature for nearby giants .",
    "a systematic error in the derived c abundance translates to an error in the n abundance obtained from cn lines and , thence , into the cno sum .",
    "a change of the cn dissociation energy by 0.05ev ( see section [ sect : nitrogen ] ) would result in a change of @xmath132 in the cno sum .",
    "other h - burning processes occur in parallel with the cn - cycle and redistribution of the relevant catalysts may lead to observable abundance anomalies .",
    "the following discussion is based on the nacre rates ( see , goriely , & jorissen 1999 ) .",
    "the nena chain provides a redistribution of ne isotopes and an increase of the na abundance and the mgal chain offers the possibility of changing the relative abundance of the three stable mg isotopes : @xmath133 mg , @xmath134 mg , and @xmath135 mg .",

    "show that in a solar mix na increases by about a factor of four from running of the @xmath101ne(@xmath136na reaction over the temperature range and proton consumptions levels required for efficient cn - cycling .",
    "such a quantitative estimate of the na increase is dependent on several uncertain reaction rates in the nena chain .",
    "the increase for a wk gb star depends on the intrinsic @xmath101ne vs [ fe / h ] and [ na / h ] vs [ fe / h ] relations .",
    "figure [ fig : f11 ] shows that indeed the wk gb stars are na - rich relative to the normal nearby giants .",
    "this increase results from the nena chain operating in parallel with the cno - cycles .",
    "the mgal chain can lead to the increase of @xmath135 mg and a decrease of @xmath134 mg relative to the dominant isotope @xmath133 mg .",
    "these alterations demand very deep mixing ( i.e. , hotter temperatures than for activation of the nena chain ) and a considerable conversion of h to he before significant alteration of the mg isotopic abundances .",
    "the inspection of our spectra indicates that mgh lines are present in the wk gb stars .",
    "since the c@xmath58 swan lines that are often blended with key mgh lines are not present in the wk gb stars , an isotopic abundance determination is promising and will be a future investigation .",
    "our abundance analysis of a complete sample of known northern wk gb stars allows the illustration of new and comprehensive results about their atmospheric composition including several results which contradict published conclusions , often based on abundances for smaller samples of wk gb stars .",
    "the new results show that the atmospheres are seriously contaminated with products of the h - burning cn - cycle and associated processes .",
    "speculations about episodes in the evolution of these stars which result in the demarcation of wk gb stars from normal giants are here curtailed . these concluding remarks are limited to setting the stage on which the key distinguishing episode in stellar evolution must play .",
    "qualitative and certainly quantitative theoretical exploration of potential episodes are left to others .",
    "a boundary condition generally accepted but not proven decisively from observations is that the striking composition of a wk gb star results from upheavals internal to the star and is not imposed by mass transfer from or induced by an orbiting companion star ( tomkin , sneden , & cottrell 1984 ; griffin 1992 ) . the binary fraction among wk gb stars is thought to be normal in sharp contrast , for example , to the ba ii k giants where all stars are binaries and the peculiar giant was created by transfer of @xmath56-process enriched material from its companion when it was an agb star ( mcclure 1983 ) .",

    "in addition , infrared spectra at 2.3 microns will provide measurements of the co first - overtone bands which will yield a different measure of the c abundance and , hence a check on the suggestion that n has been augmented by partial on - cycle conversion of some @xmath52o to n. a more difficult observation would involve spectra at 4.6 microns and a search for the isotopes @xmath52o and @xmath53o .",
    "third , the search for wk gb stars should be expanded .",
    "one key question concerns the apparent clean distinction between normal and wk gb giants - do stars with intermediate c ( and other ) abundances exist in detectable numbers ? is the wk gb star phenomenon limited to particular metallicities ?",
