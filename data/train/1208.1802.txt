    "quantum transport in semiconductor quantum dots and molecular systems is a subject of intense study nowadays.@xcite these nanoscaled devices provide a formidable environment to study fundamental aspects of quantum physics , involving many - body correlations and light - matter interaction in regimes out of equilibrium.@xcite these systems have a great potential to form a new generation of optoelectronic devices based on the unique electronic structure that arises from the quantum confinement . for instance , quantum dots can produce a wealth of visible colors depending upon its size , even white light with relatively high efficiency@xcite and potential to integrability with nanoelectronics.@xcite additionally , with the great technological advances in the manufacturing of semiconductor quantum dot system , it became possible to coherent monitor and control electron populations in two - level systems via different pump - probe techniques.@xcite in all these experiments the main signature of quantum coherent nonlinearity is rabi oscillations , which has no classical counterpart .",

    "additionally , it was proposed that a photocurrent in a self - assembled quantum dot photodiode can become spin - polarized due to an effective exchange interaction via biexciton state.@xcite this result points out the potentiality of the present system to future spintronic devices .",
    "it was also observed that the double dot structures present the ability to increase the coherence time of indirect excitons.@xcite recently , thermal effects on the excitonic rabi rotations in a quantum dot system were investigated experimentally.@xcite it was evidenced acoustic phonons as the main source of damping of the rabi oscillations .    in the present work",
    "we analyze how the temperature of nearby contacts tunnel coupled to a single quantum dot affects the coherent optical dynamics . applying nonequilibrium green function technique to a microscopic hamiltonian model , we write a set of coupled integrodifferential equations that describes the coherent evolution of the electron - hole populations in the dot , enabling the study of non - markovian effects .",
    "a resonant laser field drives the electron - hole dynamics and generates a photocurrent .",
    "we find two contributions to the current .",
    "the first one comes from electrons in the dot that tunnel to a contact .",

    "the second current component is related to electrons in the reservoir that acquires enough thermal energy to tunnel into the dot .",
    "this second contribution charges the dot , thus generating additional features not yet reported in the literature .",
    "our main findings include the suppression of the rabi oscillation as the temperature of the nearby contact increases , a negative photocurrent due to a backwards charge flow , and a maximum photocurrent value achieved when the laser intensity is comparable to the mismatch between the excited dot level and the contact chemical potential .",
