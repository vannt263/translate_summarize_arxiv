    "atomistically controlled growth of metal and semiconductor crystal surfaces constitutes an important field of research both from technological @xcite and fundamental theoretical @xcite points of view . among all the different growth techniques ,",
    "molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) has a special status since it can be very efficiently used to produce growth in well defined layer - by - layer growth mode .",
    "experiments using the reflection high - energy electron diffraction technique @xcite indicate two main mechanisms of growth in such cases : layer growth by nucleation and spreading of 2d islands on a nominally flat substrate , and step - flow growth of a substrate with steps . in the latter case , it is crucial to be in the regime where the flux of adatoms is small enough , and their diffusion fast enough to avoid island nucleation on terraces .",
    "such a window of the relevant physical parameters may be found experimentally for many materials @xcite .",
    "an important practical realization of the step - flow situation is epitaxial growth on a _ vicinal _ surface that is cut in a direction slightly off from a high - symmetry one .",
    "such surfaces often consist of broad terraces of size separated by monoatomic steps at distance @xmath1 from each other . by changing the miscut angle , the density of the steps and thus @xmath1 may be controlled .",
    "the physics of mbe growth on such surfaces can be in the simplest terms described by the following schematic model ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . there is a flux @xmath2 of adatoms that impinges upon the terraces .",
    "particles on terraces then diffuse around with an associated diffusion constant @xmath3 , and may be desorbed after a time @xmath4 . upon approaching step edges",
    ", particles can either cross them from above or below , be reflected from them , or be incorporated into the growing ledge .",
    "attachment is usually characterized by arrhenius type rate constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 which refer to the average rates of particles arriving at the ledge from below or above , respectively .",
    "this simplified picture of step flow growth was first introduced by burton _",
    "more recently , attention has been drawn to the fact that in many real systems , @xmath5 and @xmath6 need not be equal @xcite because of the existence of _ step edge barriers _",
    "these barriers may often be present at step edges due to reduced coordination of atoms .",
    "recent theoretical work shows that the step barriers play an important role in controlling growth under mbe situations @xcite .",
    "in particular , if these barriers are high adatoms can not cross steps , and the particle current will be in the direction of ascending steps . for vicinal surfaces ,",
    "this stabilizes the step flow growth mode when nucleation on terraces is neglected .",
    "if the average distance between nucleation centers is @xmath7 , step flow growth requires that @xmath8 .",
    "most of the recent work dealing with step growth has concentrated on the global properties and kinetic roughening of growing surfaces with steps under mbe conditions @xcite . however , attention has also been paid on the properties of individual steps under growth @xcite .",
    "it is a well known property of ideal , isolated 1d steps that they are thermally rough above zero temperature due to kinks . using linear stability analysis ,",
    "bales and zangwill @xcite have shown that in a system with unequal attachment rates @xmath9 , a straight terrace ledge can become unstable when @xmath10 .",
    "this kind of growth - driven instability is particularly interesting since it may lead to the appearance of `` wavy '' patterns of the ledges .",
    "more recently , salditt and spohn @xcite have argued that in addition to the instability , there is a regime for isolated steps ( in the case of strong step edge barriers ) where the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite theory of kinetic roughening is valid . in this regime ,",
    "the width of the ledge eventually roughens as @xmath11 in analogy to many 1d surface deposition models @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the nature of ledge or step edge morphologies , and the question of their roughening behavior in a simple but nontrivial model of isolated steps .",
    "this model is in part motivated by the energetics of adatoms on si(001 ) surfaces with widely separated steps . in the model , we assume infinitely strong step edge barriers , and biased diffusion both on the terrace and at the ledge . as expected @xcite , the ledge always becomes morphologically linearly unstable due to the dominance of the one - sided diffusion field . through a combination of analytic arguments and computer simulations",
    "we show that the ledge develops finger - like structures and its roughness grows linearly in time , in contrast to the kpz type of roughening predicted by salditt and spohn @xcite in the stable regime .",
    "in addition , we study the lateral coarsening of these fingers and show that it follows a @xmath0 behavior .",
    "we develop scaling arguments to study the influence of the finite width and finite length of the terrace on the growth .",
    "finally , we discuss the relevance of these results with respect to experiments on ledge roughening under mbe growth @xcite .",
    "the model is defined on a two dimensional square lattice where there is a single growing step .",
    "the average direction of the ledge is along the @xmath12 axis where the width is @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "initially at time @xmath14 the step at @xmath15 is completely straight with no thermal fluctuations present .",
    "growth of the ledge is initiated by depositing a single particle randomly on an empty , randomly chosen terrace site in front of the ledge at @xmath16 . after this",
    ", the particle performs random walk and drifts towards the ledge by jumping @xmath17 lattice sites in the @xmath18 direction at every random walk step on the average .",
    "this means that during each step , the particle moves in the @xmath18 direction with a probability @xmath19 , while for the other three directions the probability is @xmath20 .",
    "the ledge acts as an absorbing boundary to the particle with the following rules ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : ( i ) if the particle arrives at the `` top '' ( a section along the @xmath12 direction of the step ) , it is incorporated into it and becomes immobile ; ( ii ) if the particle arrives at the `` side '' ( a section along the @xmath21 direction of the step ) , it will instantaneously slide down along the ledge to the @xmath18 direction until it reaches the corner site where it is permanently incorporated into the step .",
    "these rules guarantee that the set of step heights @xmath22 as measured from @xmath15 obey the solid - on - solid restriction , and the step forms a compact structure .",
    "after the particle has been incorporated into the step , a new particle is deposited and the process is repeated .",
    "time in the model is measured in terms of the average height of the growing step edge .",
    "we note that the size of the terrace in the @xmath21 direction is not fixed , but is chosen in such a way that the distance from the highest point of the step @xmath23 is kept at a constant value . the corresponding boundary above @xmath24 is completely reflecting and remains straight .",
    "this means that a particle at @xmath25 that takes a step in the @xmath21 direction , is immediately reflected back .",
    "an important feature of the growth model is the deposition of adatoms on the lower terrace only .",
    "this is tantamount to assuming that the step barriers are infinitely high with @xmath26 so that adatoms are reflected from a downward step leading to an average particle current in the @xmath18 direction towards the up steps .",
    "the drift term @xmath27 is defined only in an average macroscopic sense and will depend on the deposition flux and the concentration of adatoms on the terrace in front of the step . also , since we assume that there is no desorption of adatoms ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath27 also depends on the velocity of the step which in turn depends on the terrace length @xmath29 .",
    "thus @xmath27 is , in principle , determined self - consistently by the other parameters of the model but we regard it as an independent parameter which may be varied externally @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the growth rules of the model are in part motivated by adatom dynamics on si(001 ) surfaces with widely separated steps @xcite under typical mbe conditions .",
    "namely , on si(001 ) diffusion is spatially anisotropic both on the terrace @xcite and at the step edges @xcite .",
    "however , at least for the case of single - height steps on si(001 ) , microscopic calculations @xcite and experiments @xcite indicate that there is no significant step edge barrier .",
    "thus , we make no attempt to realistically model the complicated adatom dynamics in this system , since the main motivation here is to study the generic features of the unstable regime for isolated steps .",
    "a straightforward monte carlo simulation of the growth model proposed here is in principle possible , but very difficult for large values of @xmath30 and small drifts .",
    "this is because particles landing on the terrace may wander arbitrarily far from the step edge , and thus the time for a particle to become incorporated into a growing step may become very large . this problem can be solved by considering the properties of 2d random walkers on a finite or semi - infinite plane . for such cases ,",
    "it is possible to calculate analytically the spatial and temporal probability distributions for the walkers .",
    "the idea then is that for particles that initially land on the terrace with @xmath31 ( which is always the case if @xmath32 ) , the simulation can be started by releasing them from an imaginary line that runs along the @xmath12 direction just one lattice site above the highest step , _",
    "i.e. _ at @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "if the particle crosses the line again in the @xmath34 direction while performing random walk , it is immediately returned to it with a new @xmath12 coordinate chosen from the appropriate spatial distribution which will be derived below . in the appendix",
    "we also calculate the mean arrival ( first passage ) time of a walker and indeed show that this time becomes very large for small values of @xmath17 and large @xmath30 .    more specifically , to implement the simulation algorithm described above , we need to calculate the spatial probability distribution function @xmath35 which is used to obtain the new position for a walker that crosses the line @xmath33 at any point . in other words ,",
    "a walker crossing the line being at @xmath36 with any @xmath37 , is put back to the new site @xmath38 with the probability @xmath39 where we assume for simplicity that @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . for a discrete walker",

    "( [ contfrac ] ) must be solved numerically in general . even in the zero drift case",
    "the expansion converges rapidly , as discussed in the appendix . in the special case of an infinitely long terrace @xmath32 , @xmath50 , and eq .",
    "( [ contfrac ] ) gives    @xmath51    in fig .",
    "3 we show the behavior of @xmath52 for various values of @xmath30 and @xmath17 . in the continuum limit , the tail of this function goes as @xmath53 for the case of zero drift .    in practice",
    ", we also need the propagator for a periodic system with a finite width @xmath13 .",
    "this is most easily obtained in the fourier space by    @xmath54    numerically , eq .",
    "( [ plxly ] ) is easy to implement using the fast fourier transform algorithm .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to write down a continuum description by using the diffusion equation ( an electrostatic analogy @xcite can also be employed ) .",
    "the probability density of a random walker @xmath55 obeys the biased diffusion equation with a source term @xmath56 :    @xmath57    using the distribution of the biased random walk , we can derive expressions for the drift term @xmath58 and the diagonal elements of the diffusion tensor @xmath59 ( @xmath60 to be @xmath61 , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we note that in the model , diffusion is always only slightly anisotropic for @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the source term @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ continuum ] ) is constant over the whole terrace .",
    "the boundary conditions are that for the step edge @xmath68 , and for the reflecting boundary @xmath69 . also , the arrival probability of a random walker at the step edge is proportional to the normal derivative of the probability field @xmath70 . with zero drift ( @xmath71 ) , eq .",
    "( [ continuum ] ) reduces to the poisson equation obeyed by many growth models ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "the present sticking rules guarantee that the growing step forms a compact structure , in contrast to the typical diffusion limited aggregation models @xcite .",
    "it is also evident from the stability analysis of salditt and spohn @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the one - sided diffusion field is highly destabilizing , and the step edge morphology is always controlled by the instability rather than described by the nonlinear kpz equation @xcite .",
    "we have performed extensive monte carlo simulations of the model with the algorithm described in sec .",
    "ii . in this work ,",
    "we consider the case of finite @xmath17 only @xcite .",
    "first , we discuss results for the roughness of the growing ledge on an infinitely long terrace ( @xmath72 ) with a large value of @xmath73 . in this case , after a short initial transient the undulations of the ledge grow and finger - like structures emerge , separated by deep cracks . the cracks",
    "deepen and the fingers themselves coarsen at the expense of other fingers . in fig .",
    "4 , we show a sequence of typical successive configurations for different values of @xmath17 . we find that the width @xmath74 of the interface associated with the ledge follows power law behavior    @xmath75 ^ 2 } \\rangle^{1/2 } = a t^{\\beta_1},\\ ] ]    where the brackets and the overbar denote an average over the configurations and over each finite system , respectively .",
    "the height variable @xmath76 is the column height of the ledge as measured from @xmath15 .",
    "numerically , we find that the width @xmath74 grows linearly with @xmath77 and its slope @xmath78 depends on the drift @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "linear growth can be understood qualitatively , since particles arriving at the vertical section of the ledge do not contribute significantly to the ledge roughness .",
    "the increase in the roughness is mainly due to particles that stick on top of the columns , and thus the width grows proportional to the total particle number , _",
    "i.e. _ time .",
    "the change in the growth rate is also easy to explain qualitatively . with small drifts ,",
    "only the top of the finger grows and very few particles reach the bottom of the cracks . with larger drifts , the probability of reaching the bottom increases , and",
    "thus @xmath79 increases more slowly ( see also fig .",
    "the value of @xmath80 is consistent with the theory of elkinani and villain @xcite for a simple 1d zeno model of mbe growth with step edge barriers . instead of ledges ,",
    "they consider deposition of adatoms on a stepped surface with diffusion .",
    "they show that with strong step edge barriers , deep cracks are formed on the surface whose depth grows linearly in time . in this case , the deposition noise is not relevant and this result can be obtained from a deterministic model .    to study the effect of a finite terrace length @xmath81 , we have simulated the model with @xmath82 , @xmath73 , and @xmath83 50 , 70 , 100 , 140 , 200 , and 500 . due to the fact that in such finite systems the relative proportion of the flux deposited in between the fingers increases with time , the width @xmath74 eventually saturates to an @xmath30 dependent value , but does _ not _ saturate as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "we find that the width satisfies the scaling _",
    "ansatz _ of family - vicsek @xcite :    @xmath84    where the scaling function @xmath85 behaves as    @xmath86    the exponent @xmath87 characterizes the surface morphology in the saturated regime @xmath88 , and the crossover time @xmath89 determines where the saturation takes over .",
    "the growth exponent for @xmath90 is @xmath91 .",
    "we find that setting @xmath80 , @xmath92 collapses our data best to a single scaling function shown in fig .",
    "we have also obtained the exponent @xmath87 by fitting to the saturated width @xmath93 and find that @xmath94 .      in our model diffusion along the ledge",
    "is limited by infinitely strong barriers , since the particles can never go around corners .",
    "this is basically the same effect as step barriers along the surface of the 1d zeno model .",
    "however , since in our model there is a real diffusion field surrounding the fingers on the terrace , additional _ finger coarsening _",
    "@xcite takes place as is evident in the configurations of fig .",
    "4 . for a finite system with @xmath95",
    ", this eventually leads to a configuration where there is only one finger present . to investigate the temporal scaling of the thickness of the fingers ,",
    "we have studied how the first zero of the green s function at @xmath96    @xmath97    behaves as a function of time .",
    "the behavior of @xmath98 should indicate the existence of a characteristic , time - dependent correlation length in the direction perpendicular to the direction of growth . in fig .",
    "7 we show @xmath98 for several values of @xmath17 when @xmath73 and @xmath32 . to a good degree of accuracy , we find that @xmath99 , with the value @xmath100 for drifts varying from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "there is , however , a long crossover regime at the beginning of the growth that depends on the drift , being longer for larger drift values .",
    "it is also interesting to study the scaling of the green s function .",
    "asymptotically , we expect @xmath103 to scale as @xcite    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is a new scaling function associated with the coarsening process . in fig .",
    "8 we show scaling of the data for @xmath103 , with a very good data collapse obtained with @xmath80 and @xmath106 @xcite . it is interesting to note that the finger coarsening in the present model follows the same power law of 1/3 as model b , which describes domain coarsening due to long range diffusion @xcite .",
    "however , although qualitatively similar , the present scaling function depicted in fig .",
    "8 is quantitatively different from that of model b @xcite .",
    "the exponent 1/3 also appears in models of noise - driven coarsening of mounds in 1d surface growth where slope selection occurs because of step edge barriers @xcite .",
    "the finite - size scaling of @xmath107 is different from that of the width @xmath79 , since for a system with a finite terrace width @xmath95 but with @xmath32 , the late - time configuration consist of one finger only , whose vertical roughness @xmath79 keeps on growing linearly but whose @xmath107 saturates .",
    "this introduces a new exponent @xmath108 that controls the saturation of @xmath107 in the @xmath12 direction . on the other hand , for @xmath40 and @xmath49 ,",
    "_ both _ @xmath79 _ and _ @xmath107 saturate , and their saturation must be characterized by the same exponent @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ wlyt ] ) .",
    "thus , for the general case of both @xmath110 , we expect the following scaling form to hold :    @xmath111    we will not study the whole scaling function @xmath112 here but consider the effects of a finite @xmath13 and @xmath30 separately @xcite .",
    "for @xmath32 , we can again write down the family - viscek form as    @xmath113    where now @xmath114 , and the scaling function @xmath115 has the same limits as @xmath116 , but now with a new roughness exponent @xmath117 . we have simulated the model with @xmath118 20 , 50 , 100 , and 200 using the drift @xmath119 . because of the single finger final configuration , there are large fluctuations in the data and thus we have determined the saturation exponent @xmath117 by estimating the saturated width @xmath120 directly for various values of @xmath13 . from the data ,",
    "our best estimate is @xmath121 , _",
    "i.e. _ the width of the final finger grows as the horizontal system size .",
    "together with @xmath122 this implies that @xmath123 .    in the case of a finite @xmath30",
    ", we expect that the scaling form satisfies    @xmath124    where @xmath125 must now satisfy the relation @xmath126 , with @xmath127 being another new roughness exponent .",
    "the limits of @xmath128 and @xmath116 are again of the same form . by using system sizes",
    "@xmath83 50 , 70 , 100 , 140 , 200 , and 500 with the drift @xmath129 , our data collapses to the scaling form shown in fig . 9 with @xmath130 and @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , we have obtained another estimate of the new saturation exponent @xmath127 by estimating the saturated width @xmath131 and indeed verify that @xmath132 .",
    "in summary , we have in this work introduced and examined a very simple model for the growth of an isolated step with infinitely strong step edge barriers .",
    "the destabilizing effect of the one - sided biased diffusion field coupled with strongly anisotropic adatom dynamics makes the ledge morphologically unstable , with finger - like structures developing separated by deep cracks . after an initial early - time transient",
    "the fingers coarsen as @xmath0 and the width of the ledge grows linearly . for an infinitely wide and long terrace ,",
    "the fingers eventually become needle - like .",
    "we have also studied the finite - size scaling of both the coarsening and the width of the ledge in detail , and determined the corresponding scaling exponents .",
    "recently , pierre - louis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have considered in detail a more realistic model of step train growth in the case of weak desorption , and one - side attachment . as in the present case",
    ", they find that the step morphology is linearly unstable , but now the individual step widths grow @xmath133 , with the steps `` locked in '' together . in this regime , there is no step coarsening , either .",
    "thus , we expect our model to be relevant only for the case where the steps are well isolated , and detachment from step edges can be neglected .    experimentally ,",
    "growth of steps on slightly miscut si(001 ) surfaces has been studied , with the claimed result that the step roughening is consistent with the kpz prediction @xcite . however , at least superficially the steps depicted in ref . @xcite",
    "appear to develop finger - like structures separated by deep grooves characteristic of the unstable regime studied here and in ref .",
    "it would be interesting to carry out more systematic studies of roughening of widely spaced steps on semicondutor surfaces to characterize the nature of the instability .          in this appendix",
    ", we calculate explicitly the average arrival time @xmath135 of a walker to demonstrate the need to use the present algorithm .",
    "we will also discuss the convergence of the probability distribution for finite terraces with @xmath49 . to begin with",

    "again , @xmath141 when @xmath142 and @xmath143 can be obtained .",
    "the average arrival time is proportional to the first derivative of the characteristic function at @xmath144 by    @xmath145 \\nonumber \\\\   & =   & { { d \\widetilde p_{ly}(\\omega)}\\over{d\\omega}}\\vert_{\\omega=0}= -2ia \\sum_{n=1}^{ly } ( { { 1}\\over{b } } ) ^n % \\nonumber \\\\   % & = & 2a[{{1-({1\\over{b}})^{ly+1}}\\over{1-{1\\over{b } } } } - 1 ] \\nonumber \\\\   & = & ( 1+{1\\over{\\ell_d}})[1-{1\\over{(1 + 4\\ell_d)^{ly}}}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when @xmath146 . in the infinite terrace limit ( @xmath147 ) , @xmath148 , while for @xmath71 it is easy to show that @xmath149 .",
