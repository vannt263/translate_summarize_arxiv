    "thermal sputtering , evaporation in grain - grain collision , thermal sublimation or desorption are some examples of destruction processes , but the most important mechanism for cycling dust back to the gas phase resides in supernova shocks ( jones et al .",

    "we obtain a reasonable agreement between the model and the data for both si / zn and si / s ratios .",
    "this suggests that the dust contribution of accretion together with dust production by type ii sne and agb is able to explain the depletion pattern of silicon observed in dla systems .",

    "the observed iron depletion tends to vanish at the lowest metallicities , suggesting that the mechanisms of production of iron - rich dust take place on longer time scales than those typical of type ii sne .",
    "the gap between the total ism model and the gas - phase data increases with metallicity , indicating that the mechanisms of production of iron - rich dust must be metallicity - dependent .",
    "however , at variance with the case of silicon , the gas - phase model ( black solid line ) does not fit at all the gas - phase fe / s and fe / zn data .",
    "in fact , the model lies much higher than the data , suggesting that the adopted model predicts too little iron in dust . in this model ,",
    "only the accretion process plays a significant contribution , whereas the dust production by type ii sne and agb stars leads to a negligible fraction with respect to the total iron abundance in the ism . even if we invoke a major contribution by either type ii sne or agb stars , the total iron in dust would be still negligible with respect to the huge iron amount ejected by type i a sne in the gas phase .",
    "for this reason , the model can not predict any appreciable iron depletion until the metallicity becomes high enough to make the accretion process important .",
    "it is evident that an extra source of iron dust production must be added to the model to reduce the discrepancy with the data .",
    "we considered two possibilities .",

    "the results are shown as black short dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ref_vol ] .",
    "one can see that this model is unable to follow the trend of the measured iron abundance ratios . as a second possibility",
    ", we assumed that the bulk of iron is incorporated in a solid component , different from silicates , characterized by a high accretion efficiency .",
    "the existence of an iron dust population is suggested by other work ( see session  [ discussion ] ) . in particular , the existence of iron - rich , metallic nano - particles is considered in recent studies ( draine @xmath1 hensley , 2012 - 2013 ) .",
    "such particles might have sizes one order of magnitude smaller than the standard size of silicate particles adopted in eq .",
    "( [ asano_accr ] ) .",
    "the same equation predicts that the accretion time scale should be correspondingly smaller .",
    "therefore , to increase the efficiency of iron accretion we reduced the accretion time - scale by a factor 5 and 10 . with such prescriptions we obtain a better match to the data ( green short dotted lines and blue dashed - dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ref_vol ] , respectively ) .",
    "all the models that we have considered trace each other in the low metallicity range ( early epochs ) , while they evolve in a substantially different way at metallicities above @xmath133 and @xmath134 for sulfur and zinc respectively .",
    "this is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ asano_accr ] ) and what we explained in section  [ following_paragraph ] : the dust accretion becomes important as the metallicity increases and , in particular , when it reaches a critical value .",
    "in our work we have reproduced the depletion pattern of silicon and iron in the ism of dla systems : we show that when we consider dust accretion and formation from type ii sne and agb stars , a good agreement is obtained for silicon , but not for iron . the results that we have found support a scenario in which iron and silicon undergo a different history of dust formation and evolution .",
    "iron and silicon are believed to be coupled in silicate species , mostly in olivine ( @xmath135 ) and pyroxene ( @xmath136 ) compounds .",
    "the absorption of silicate features at 9.7 and 20 @xmath137 m has been observed in a variety of environments , such as the diffuse ism , cold and dark interstellar clouds , planetary nebulae and also in dla systems ( nuth @xmath1 hecht 1990 , swamy 2005 , kulkarni et al.2007 ) .",
    "observations in the local interstellar clouds by kimura et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested an iron enrichment in the cores of silicate grains composed by triolite ( fes ) , kamacite ( feni ) or oxides ( feo ) .",
    "additional interstellar observations suggest the existence of a dust species decoupled from silicates : fe and si depletion in the small magellanic cloud often diverges ( sofia et al .",
    "2006 ) , indicating that iron is not tied to the same grains as silicon .",
    "voshchinnikov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) studied dust depletion in 196 different sight lines of the milky way , arguing that silicates grains can not be a composition of olivines and pyroxenes only , but some amount of iron should reside in another dust population .",
    "iron needles could represent an important additional dust species , having an appreciable contribution in the total amount of iron dust : dwek ( 2004 ) argued that iron needles contribute to the unexpected extinction law in the mid - infrared observation ( @xmath138 ) of the galactic center .",
    "in addition , theoretical prescriptions ( hoyle 1999 ) , different abundance ratio in various physical conditions ( voshchinnikov et al . 2010 ) and possible contribution of iron needles in cas a ( dwek 2004 ) and sn 1987a ( wickramasinghe @xmath1 wickramasinghe 1993 ) may suggest that : 1 ) those needles can be readily created in sne environments and , 2 ) the destruction of silicates grains in the warm medium is more effective than for fe - rich grains or , in other words that iron particles are more resistant in the harshest ism conditions .",
    "whilst the existence of a form of iron dust decoupled from silicates is suggested by many authors , its origin and nature are still under debate ( vladilo 2004 ) .",
    "the iron dust problem arises from the fact the bulk of this element is produced by type ia sne , but at the same time there is no evidence of iron dust particles in these sne ( see end of section  [ sformation ] ) . in our work",
    "we suggest that this iron species may originate directly in the ism .",
    "further evidence of iron dust accreting in the ism is provided by dwek ( 2016 ) . here",
    ", we demonstrate this possibility in a chemical evolution context .",
    "draine @xmath1 hensley ( 2012 - 2013 ) also investigated the same possibility : they show that the sub millimeter and millimeter excess observed in low - metallicity galaxies might be explained by the presence of magnetic nano - particles , with radius @xmath139 , which include a large fraction of interstellar fe .    if future observations will prove the existence of metallic nano - particles , the possibility that such solid component is partly produced by type ia sne could be addressed with specific observational tests . as far as models are concerned , new algorithms for the production of metallic nano - particles by type ia sne may be added to the efficient accretion in the ism in order to improve the fit to the observed gas phase abundances in dla systems .",
    "this possibility will be explored in a future work .",
    "in this work we have presented a chemical evolution model which takes into account the presence of dust utilizing new updated prescriptions .",
    "dust formation is treated in the same way as first done by dwek ( 1998 ) , but with the inclusion of improved condensation efficiencies of piovan et al .",
    "with respect to other models such as those of calura et al .",
    "( 2008 ) or grieco et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we have also changed the accretion and destruction prescriptions , which are two very important processes in dust evolution .",
    "we have applied our model to dwarf irregular galaxies and dla systems .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we studied the dust production rate and the processes occurring in the ism during the galactic lifetime of a typical irregular galaxy .",
    "we have computed the evolution of dust by considering dust production ( type ii sne , agb stars ) , destruction and accretion processes .",
    "it is worth noting that we excluded the type ia sne as dust producers since there is no observational evidence for that .",
    "we have found that dust accretion plays a fundamental role in dust evolution and in certain phases it becomes the dominant process , governing the evolution of the dust mass in the ism , as predicted by asano et al .",
    "moreover our model reproduces the observed dust - to - gas ratios as function of metallicity in such galaxies .",
    "we investigated the impact of the cut - off of high mass stars ( from @xmath140 to @xmath141 ) on the chemical evolution of a typical irregular galaxy .",
    "we fail in reproducing the metallicity values observed in dwarf irregulars when the cut - off mass is assumed to be in the range 18 - 25@xmath16 . on the other hand",
    ", this effect does not deeply affect the predicted range of dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "we compared the dust formation when both p11 and d98 condensation efficiencies are adopted .",
    "we found that the rate production of carbon is almost the same using different prescriptions , while the main differences concern silicates : using d98 condensation efficiencies , type ia sne play a significant role and , in addition , a major contribution is given by type ii and lims .",
    "4 .   dust destruction represents a negligible process in dwarf irregulars , whereas the galactic wind is an important mechanism which can affect dust evolution : we showed that it can be the main responsible for stopping the accretion process in the ism .",
    "we compared our model for irregulars with the data of dla systems and we found that these objects can indeed be irregular galaxies , as already suggested in previous papers .",
    "we found a particular combination of parameters which best fit the dlas .",
    "in particular , our comparison shows that the depletion pattern of silicon in these objects is well reproduced by the dust contributions of type ii sne , agbs and by the accretion process .",
    "6 .   in the case of iron , at variance with the case of silicon",
    ", we find a good agreement with the data only when an extra dust source is considered : in particular , we tested the case of dust production by type ia sne and the case of a more efficient accretion in the ism . the different behavior of iron and silicon that we find brings new evidence that a significant fraction of iron has to be incorporated into a dust population different from silicates , as suggested by previous works .",
    "furthermore , as part of iron dust should be decoupled from silicates , it is possible that such species could originate in a different way : in particular , our results are consistent with a metallicity - dependent accretion of iron nano - particles .",
