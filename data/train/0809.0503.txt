    "m67 ( ngc 2682 ) is one of the best studied open clusters .",
    "it is also one of the oldest known galactic clusters , with an estimated age of about 4 gyr .",
    "other parameters of the cluster are : @xmath2 and distance modulus @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "m67 contains a high percentage of blue stragglers , stars which are bluer and more luminous than the main sequence turnoff point of the cluster . for m67",
    ", the turnoff occurs near @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the formation mechanism of blue straggles is still debated , but the most probable scenario is via mass transfer or mergers in close binaries @xcite .",
    "several blue stragglers in m67 are known to be eclipsing binaries , which supports this hypothesis .",
    "the large number of close binaries in m67 is suggested by the relatively large number ( 25 ) of x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "in such an old cluster , the x - ray sources can not be single rapidly - rotating stars , but ",
    "more likely  are tidally locked components of close binaries . in addition , long - term spectroscopic surveys of m67 @xcite revealed among the blue stragglers , 5 spectroscopic binaries with orbital periods between 850  5000 days .    in this paper , we present two time series of rapid , quasi - continuous photometry for selected targets in m67 obtained with the most ( microvariability & oscillations of stars ) satellite in 2004 and 2007 .",
    "the targets were selected primarily to study two domains of cluster objects accessible to a small telescope like most : the upper main sequence ( mostly blue stragglers ) and red giants . here",
    "we describe the results for the former group of objects , including two @xmath1  scuti , while a future paper ( kallinger et al . , in preparation ) will describe analyses and asteroseismology of the p - mode pulsations of the red giants in the cluster .",
    "the main goals of the observations in the context of this paper were twofold : ( i )  a search for new variables with very small amplitudes , and ( ii )  obtaining high - quality light curves , particularly for blue stragglers with periods close to one day which are difficult to sample properly with ground - based observations . as we describe in section",
    "[ observe ] , the 2004 observations were experimental and short ( compared to other most runs ) , while the scope of the 2007 observations was much expanded to include time series photometry of a large number of guide stars in the m67 field .",
    "the photometric observations of most have been augmented by medium - dispersion spectroscopy performed at the david dunlap observatory ( ddo ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ observe ] presents most time - series photometry and spectroscopic observations performed at the ddo .",
    "the light variations are described in section  [ lightcurves ] while a detailed discussion of individual binary systems known or found to be variable is given in section  [ results ] .",
    "the @xmath1  scuti pulsating stars are discussed separately in section  [ deltascuti ] .",
    "the paper is concluded with the summary of the results in section  [ sum ] .",
    "most ( microvariability & oscillations of stars ) is a microsatellite housing a 15-cm telescope which feeds a ccd photometer through a single , custom , broadband optical filter ( 350 - 700 nm ) .",
    "the pre - launch characteristics of the mission are described by @xcite and the initial post - launch performance by @xcite .",
    "most is in a sun - synchronous polar orbit ( 820 km altitude ) from which it can monitor some stars for as long as 2 months without interruption .",
    "the instrument was designed to obtain highly precise photometry of single , bright stars through fabry lens imaging . since the launch , the satellite capabilities have been expanded to obtain direct imaging photometry of fainter stars in sub - rasters of the open area of the science ccd , and to obtain photometry of the guide stars used to orient the spacecraft . both observing modes yield the same time sampling and coverage as the primary science target in the most field .",
    "most was never originally intended to obtain photometry of stars fainter than @xmath6 , nor of multiple targets in a stellar cluster field .",
    "its pre - launch mission goals were asteroseismology of bright solar - type stars , wolf - rayet and magnetic pulsating stars . the lack of multicolour measurements with most limits detailed modelling of the light curves of eclipsing binaries , particularly with components of very different spectral types . however , the ability to monitor such systems nearly continuously for weeks at a time leads to excellent light curves which are useful for variable star detection and for studies of variables whose periods are close to an integer number of days .    with 3 arcsec pixels and the @xmath7 ccd detector ,",
    "the field of view of the open area of the most science ccd is about @xmath8 ( part of the field is taken by the fabry lenses ) .",
    "this is larger than the size of the inner part of the m67 cluster as defined by its brightest stars . as a result",
    ", we could include as guide stars and obtain photometry for several stars which are close to m67 , but are not members of the cluster .",
    "two of these stars ( hd  75638 and gsc  814 - 323 ) were found to be eclipsing binaries ( or multiple systems containing an eclipsing binary ) .",
    "the first series of m67 observations was 10 days long , during 13 - 23 february 2004 and was designed as a test of most extended capability . in this run , 30 objects were observed in the direct imaging mode in small sub - rasters of various sizes .",
    "the second run covered 30 days during 12 february - 14 march 2007 .",
    "the pointing performance of the spacecraft had been dramatically improved by this time , and the guide star photometric capability had been implemented . in this run",
    ", about 40 guide stars were monitored with an additional 6 stars observed as direct imaging targets .",
    "about 3/4 through this second observing run ( on 5 march 2007 ) , the roll angle of the satellite was changed to reduce the amount of scattered earthshine on the most focal plane . as a result of the change in focal plane orientation ,",
    "38 of the original 42 guide stars could be retained , and 6 new ones were added for the remainder of the run .",
    "there was no change in the selection of direct imaging targets after the roll change .",
    "all the most m67 targets are marked in the colour  magnitude diagram of m67 in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "most guide star photometry was processed on board the satellite .",
    "direct imaging data were processed on the ground , after downloading of the six @xmath9-pixel sub - rasters ( for the 2007 run ) centred on target stars , much like conventional ccd photometry . in january 2006 , most lost use of its startracker ccd due to a severe charged particle strike , and since then , both satellite attitude control and science functions have been shared by the science ccd .",
    "this means that individual exposures must be now relatively short ( less than 3.5 sec ) to update the pointing information sufficiently rapidly .",
    "hence , we stack exposures on board to achieve high @xmath10 values . during the 2007 run ,",
    "stacks consisted typically of 14 exposures , each 1.5 sec long . for the faintest stars ,",
    "the cumulative ccd readout noise for the stacked exposures is the dominant noise source .",
    "a list of the observed stars is given in table  [ tab01 ] .",
    "all the raw data and the reduced light curves presented in this paper are available in the most public data archive , accessed through the science page of the most mission web site at www.astro.ubc.ca/most .    in 2007 , six known blue stragglers ( sanders 1036 , 1082 , 1263 , 1280 , 1282 , 1284 ) were observed in the direct imaging mode .",
    "s1082 ( es  cnc ) was monitored as a guide star and in the direct imaging mode .",
    "the latter mode , being similar to conventional ccd area photometry , produces the more precise photometry .",
    "an attempt was made to analyse photometry of five guide stars ( hd 75784 , bd + 13@xmath112006 , hd 75717 , sao 98164 and gsc  816 - 2629 ) used for the 2004 run , but the short exposures ( and lack of onboard stacking ) and the larger pointing wander experienced earlier in the most mission , meant a relatively large photometric scatter for those targets .",
    "the focal plane scale of 3 arcsec per pixel , the pointing wander of a few pixels in the 2004 data and the typical fwhm of 2.5 pixels led to blending of images which was a serious concern for visual pairs separated by less than 1015 arcsec .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,>,>,>,>,<,^,^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      ev  cnc ( s1036 , mmj  5833 , spectral type f3 ) is another blue straggler binary .",
    "the system is very probably close to contact or perhaps already in contact , and is seen at low inclination .",
    "the light curve of the system is rather unusual : although the light curve is continuous , indicating the contact binary nature of the system , the depths of minima are significantly different , hardly consistent with the components being in contact . also , the maximum following the primary minimum is about 0.025 mag brighter than the other maximum .",
    "the system was initially detected by @xcite and extensively studied by @xcite , who improved the ephemeris for minimum light to @xmath12 . their grid - search approach to find the most probable geometric and spot parameters led to a fairly uncertain result , exacerbated by the lack of a spectroscopic mass ratio , @xmath13 .",
    "if the system is in contact , its inclination angle is @xmath14 , its mass ratio is @xmath15 and at least two dark spots are required to reproduce the light curve .",
    "@xcite noted small variations in the shape of the phase diagram on timescales of about a month .",
    "our most photometry allowed us to determine reliably 10 new times of minimum for ev  cnc ( table  [ tab03 ] ) . combining our new minima with the published ones leads to an improvement of the ephemeris to @xmath16 .",
    "our light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) , shows a very similar shape to that of @xcite or @xcite , indicating very stable surface structures , similar to the behaviour found in the contact binary ag  vir @xcite .",
    "we attempted to model the light curve of ev  cnc but we found that there are many combinations of parameters leading to similar quality fits .",
    "thus , we could add little to the discussion of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we found that the temperature of the secondary component @xmath17 can not be determined reliably because of the strong correlation between @xmath17 , the fill - out factor , and the inclination angle .",
    "any further progress in understanding ev  cnc requires a dedicated spectroscopic study providing a reliable mass ratio .",
    "hv  cnc ( s986 , mmj  5624 ) is very probably a member of m67 @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations by @xcite show that the system is a single - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb1 ) with a circular orbit and a period of 10.3386 days .",
    "eclipses were observed later by @xcite .",
    "the authors found another component in the spectra which they identified with a third star in the system , contributing about 11.5% to the total light . through a deconvolution of the photometry of all three stars",
    ", it was found that the primary is hotter than the turn - off point of the cluster so it is a blue straggler .",
    "hv  cnc was observed by the most satellite only during the 2004 observing run .",
    "one primary minimum at hjd 2453055.828 was observed .",
    "the minimum occurred very close to the time predicted by the ephemeris of @xcite , at phase 0.99928 , proving that the orbital period is very stable .",
    "no mass transfer or stronger interactions of components is possible for such a relatively long orbital period .",
    "hv  cnc is rather faint for most photometry ( @xmath18 = 12.73 ) , especially early in the mission , and the data show a scatter as large as 0.02 mag , so that secondary minima could not be detected .",
    "no spectra of hv  cnc were obtained at ddo because the system is too faint for the 1.88 m telescope .",
    "gsc  814 - 323 ( s1522 , bd + 12@xmath111929 ) is most probably not a member of m67 @xcite .",
    "it is , however , a visual pair ( wds 08522 + 1217 ) consisting of stars with @xmath19 and @xmath20 separated by @xmath21 = 14.4 arcsec at a position angle @xmath22 = 140@xmath11 .    the most photometry revealed a single , well - defined , partial eclipse centred at hjd 2454154.481 and lasting about 9 hours .",
    "the brightness of the system dropped by 0.33 mag ( fig  [ fig04 ] ) .",
    "since the system was observed in the guide star mode ( processed on board the satellite ) and the most focal plane scale is 3 arcsec / pixel , the photometry is expected to include both visual components . if the brighter component is the eclipsing binary , then the corrected amplitude of the eclipse would be about 0.48 mag .",
    "the fainter component can not be responsible for the eclipse because even its total exclusion would result in a drop of 0.34 mag in brightness .",
    "unfortunately , only one eclipse was recorded during the first part of the most 2007 run , setting a lower limit on the orbital period of about 11 days .",
    "the system was not detected as a variable during the asas nor the nsvs variability surveys .",
    "there is a single radial velocity measurement of gsc  814 - 323 at hjd 2441321.88 published by @xcite , giving @xmath23 km  s@xmath24 .",
    "the measurement probably refers to the brighter component of the visual pair .",
    "two spectra taken at ddo suggest that the system is a double - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb2 ) ; see fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] .",
    "the ratio of intensities , as estimated from the bfs when the components are split , is about @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , we could expect secondary eclipses about 0.09 mag deep .",
    "more spectra are needed to find the orbital period and to characterise this triple system .",
    "hd75638 ( gsc  814 - 601 , bd + 12@xmath111925 ; spectral type f0 ) is another field star close to m67 .",
    "the star is , in fact , a known visual triple system ( wds 08515 + 1208 ) consisting of components a  ( @xmath26 ) , b  ( @xmath27 ) and c  ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "while the pair ab is rather tight ( @xmath21 = 1.4 arcsec ) , the faintest component c is separated by 15.1 arcsec from the brightest one ; it is too far to contribute to the aperture photometry used for the most data .",
    "hd  75638 ( components",
    "ab ) was found to be an sb3 system in the survey of @xcite .",
    "analysis of 13 spectra showed two measurable components with @xmath29 = 80 km  s@xmath24 and @xmath30 = 10 km  s@xmath24 , temperatures @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , and a luminosity ratio of 0.10 .",
    "a preliminary orbit for the fainter component was given : @xmath33 = 5.8167(9 ) days , @xmath34 = 11.05(91 ) km  s@xmath24 , @xmath35 = 28.9(12 ) km  s@xmath24 , @xmath36 = 0.083(56 ) , and @xmath37 = 322(28 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic orbit most likely corresponds to the motion of the blend of a faint pair seen as component b.    the system was used as a guide star in the most 2007 observations of m67 .",
    "the photometry covers three consecutive eclipses .",
    "the eclipse depth is very shallow ( only about 0.013 mag ) and the eclipses are total ( see fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] ) .",
    "it is very probable that it is the fainter component of the close visual pair ( component b ) which is the eclipsing binary with its light being diluted by the brighter component .",
    "in such a case , the original , undiluted amplitude of eclipses would be 0.09 mag .",
    "since the eclipses are total , the ratio of radii can be determined to be @xmath38 .",
    "the preliminary mid - eclipse ephemeris is hjd @xmath39 days .",
    "our spectroscopy included the ab pair , which could not be separated at the spectrograph slit because the typical seeing at the site ( @xmath402 arcsec ) is larger than the separation of the pair .",
    "the broadening functions ( fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) show the brighter , rapidly - rotating component ( @xmath41 km  s@xmath24 ) to be stationary in radial velocity ; this star is most likely the a component of the visual pair .",
    "the fainter component shows radial velocity variations and is definitely responsible for the eclipses .",
    "our three spectra show that the features of the eclipsing pair are always blended , suggesting that high - resolution spectroscopy will be necessary to reliably define orbits of both components .",
    "the quality of the most data varied over the two runs and depended on the position of the target on the ccd chip mainly because of time and spatial dependence of the stray light and/or background . for faint pulsating stars observed in the m67 field",
    ", the instrumentally introduced periodicities affected the period analysis and its conclusions and limited our ability to detect very small amplitude pulsations .",
    "the direct imaging objects could in general be followed through the whole satellite orbit so that the data were entirely suitable for the period analysis but for the guide stars , the background variation led to exclusion of about 20% of the satellite period . for both sets of data , however , intermittent gaps occurred hence we used the method of @xcite of period finding with fourier transform of unevenly spaced data points .",
    "it turned out that all stars observed in the guide star mode were unsuitable for a sound periodic analysis .",
    "thus , we can not say anything about any of the remaining observed blue stragglers , sanders 752 , 968 , 977 , 1066 , and 1466 , which show the frequency spectrum dominated by the satellite orbital frequency 14.1994 c / day and its integer multiples .",
    "the second strong periodicity in the data ( 1 c / day ) arises from the periodic returns of the satellite to the earthshine illumination conditions , which determine the background level .",
    "thus , for these stars , any intrinsic variability must have amplitudes smaller than about 0.001 mag ; this limit also applies to sanders 1263 which was observed in the raster mode .    because the direct imaging observations were almost continuous , the spectral window for such observations is virtually free of aliasing .",
    "the spectral window for the guide stars shows strong side - lobes corresponding the orbital frequency of the satellite .",
    "ex  cnc ( s1284 , mmj  6504 ) is very probably member of m67 @xcite .",
    "its variability was discovered by @xcite and later studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most detailed investigation of this @xmath1  sct variable resulted from the large multi - site campaign of @xcite .",
    "the authors presented photometric data from eight sites using nine telescopes of 0.6 m to 2.1 m , performed over 43 days .",
    "the authors were able to detect 26 frequencies in their data , but the spectral window was poor and contained rather strong side - lobes .",
    "ex  cnc was observed by the most satellite almost continuously over 30 days in 2007 .",
    "the pulsations and their beating are directly visible in the data ( see fig .  [ fig05 ] ) . after the change of the satellite roll angle during the 2007 run ,",
    "the data were of lower quality .",
    "for that reason , only the best and the least interrupted continuous part of the run was selected for the period analysis within @xmath42 . although the per - point error is about 0.01 mag , the run is homogeneous and the spectral window is practically single peaked ; the only side - lobes with less than 10% strength correspond to the satellite orbital cycle at the frequencies @xmath4314.2 c / day .",
    "the amplitude spectrum and the corresponding spectral window are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] .",
    "the total number of reliably detected frequencies for ex  cnc is over 20 with most corresponding to 26 frequencies detected by @xcite .",
    "the accord between the results is surprisingly good : out of the 22 strongest frequencies detected by @xcite we could find 20 . because our useful observing window is shorter , we could not resolve several close pairs of frequencies resolved by the authors . except for the frequencies found by the authors",
    ", we found few additional modes at 20.855 c / day , 29.385 c / day , 13.205 c / day and 15.19 c / d .",
    "the last two , however , could be connected with the orbital period of the satellite .",

    "<S> we present two series of most ( microvariability & oscillations of stars ) space - based photometry , covering nearly continuously 10 days in 2004 and 30 days in 2007 , of selected variable stars in the upper main sequence of the old open cluster m67 . </S>",
    "<S> new high - precision light curves were obtained for the blue - straggler binary / triple systems ah  cnc , es  cnc and ev  cnc . </S>",
    "<S> the precision and phase coverage of es  cnc and ev  cnc is by far superior to any previous observations . </S>",
    "<S> the light curve of es  cnc is modelled in detail , assuming two dark photospheric spots and roche geometry . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the light curve of ah  cnc indicates a low mass ratio ( @xmath0 ) and a high inclination angle for this system . </S>",
    "<S> two new long - period eclipsing binaries , gsc  814323 and hd  75638 ( non - members of m67 ) were discovered . </S>",
    "<S> we also present ground - based ddo spectroscopy of es  cnc and of the newly found eclipsing binaries . </S>",
    "<S> especially interesting is hd  75638 , a member of a visual binary , which must itself be a triple or a higher - multiplicity system . </S>",
    "<S> new light curves of two @xmath1  scuti pulsators , ex  cnc and ew  cnc , have been analyzed leading to detection of 26 and 8 pulsation frequencies of high temporal stability .    </S>",
    "<S> [ firstpage ]    stars : close binaries - stars : eclipsing binaries  stars : variable stars </S>"
