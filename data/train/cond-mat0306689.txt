    "in the last decade , a lot of research activity took place to unveil the properties of granular materials@xmath2 , primarily because of their industrial importance , but also due to their fascinating properties .",
    "this has unraveled many interesting and so far unresolved phenomena ( for example , clustering , size - segregation , avalanches , the coexistence of gas , liquid and solid , etc . ) . under highly excited conditions , granular materials",
    "behave as a fluid , with prominent _ non - newtonian _ properties , like the normal stress differences@xmath3 . while the normal stress differences are of _ infinitesimal _ magnitudes in a simple fluid ( e.g.  air and water ) , they can be of the order of its isotropic pressure in a dilute granular gas@xmath4 . from the modelling viewpoint ,",
    "the presence of such large normal - stress differences readily calls for higher - order constitutive models@xmath5 even at the _ minimal _ level .",
    "studying the non - newtonian behaviour is itself an important issue , since the normal stresses are known to be the _ progenitors _ of many interesting and unique flow - features ( e.g.  rod - climbing or weissenberg - effect , die - swelling , secondary flows , etc.@xmath6 ) in non - newtonian fluids .",
    "also , normal stresses can support additional instability modes ( for example , in polymeric fluids and suspensions@xmath7 , which might , in turn , explain some flow - features of granular fluids .",
    "for example , particle - clustering@xmath8 has recently been explained from the instability - viewpoint using the standard newtonian model for the stress tensor@xmath9    the kinetic theory of jenkins & richman@xmath10 first showed that the _ anisotropy _ in the second moment of the fluctuation velocities , due to the inelasticity of particle collisions , is responsible for such normal stress behaviour .",
    "they predicted that the first normal stress difference ( defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the streamwise and the transverse components of the stress deviator , respectively , and @xmath14 is the isotropic pressure , see section iib ) is maximum in the dilute limit , decreases in magnitude with density , and eventually approaches zero in the dense limit .",
    "goldhirsch & sela@xmath4 later showed that the normal stress differences appear only at the burnett - order - description of the chapman - enskog expansion of the boltzmann equation .",
    "their work has clearly established that the _ origin _ of this effect ( in the dilute limit ) is _ universal _ in both atomic and granular fluids , with inelasticity playing the role of a _ magnifier _ and thus making it a sizeable effect in granular fluids . while the _ source _ of the normal stress differences in the dilute limit has been elucidated both theoretically and by simulation ,",
    "its _ dense _ counterpart has not received similar attention so far .",
    "this is an important limit since the _ onset _ of _ dilatancy _ ( volume expansion due to shear@xmath15 ) , crystallization , etc .",
    "occur in the dense regime , which in turn would influence the normal stress differences .",
    "previous hard - sphere simulations@xmath16 did look at the normal stress differences , but they did not probe the _ dense _ limit in a systematic way .",
    "these simulations showed that the first normal stress difference vanishes in the dense limit , in line with the theoretical predictions of jenkins & richman@xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "the soft - sphere simulations of walton & braun@xmath17 , with frictional particles , showed that this quantity can change sign in the same limit .",
    "our work with smooth inelastic hard - disks unequivocally demonstrates that @xmath0 , indeed , changes its sign at some critical density in the dense regime , due to the sign - change of its collisional component at a critical density , which depends on the value of the coefficient of restitution ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "more importantly , we show that the origin of @xmath0 in the dense limit is distinctly different from that in a dilute granular gas . at the _ microstructural_-level , certain topological changes in the _ anisotropic _ structure of the collision - angle distribution with density are responsible for the observed sign - reversal of @xmath0 .",
    "we use the familiar smooth hard - disk model for an event - driven simulation@xmath19 of the uniform shear flow configuration , focussing mainly on the normal stress behaviour and the microstructure formation as functions of the density and inelasticity .",
    "the details of the simulation technique and the relevant macroscopic quantities are described in section  [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "the simulation results on the first normal stress difference , the radial distribution function , the collision angle distribution and the crystalline - structure are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "possible modelling approaches to incorporate the normal stress differences are discussed in section  [ sec : nonnewtonian ] . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our findings , with suggestions for possible future work .",
    "we consider a collection of smooth inelastic hard - disks in a square box of size @xmath20 under uniform shear flow  let @xmath21 and @xmath22 be the streamwise and transverse directions , respectively , with the origin of the coordinate - frame being positioned at the centre of the box . the snapshot of a typical simulation , with non - dimensional coordinates , is shown in fig .",
    "1(@xmath23 ) .",
    "note that the dimensional quantities are denoted by tildes , and the reference length , time and velocity scales for non - dimensionalization will be specified later in this section .",
    "let the diameter and the mass of the particle be @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the pre- and post - collisional particle velocities of particle @xmath26 are denoted by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "hence , the velocity of particle @xmath29 relative to @xmath26 is @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the unit vector directed from the center of particle @xmath29 to that of particle @xmath26 at contact .",
    "the pre- and post - collisional velocities are related by the expression : @xmath32 where @xmath18 is the coefficient of normal restitution , with @xmath33 ; note that we restrict ourselves to perfectly smooth particles .",
    "the expression for the collisional impulse is @xmath34 directed along @xmath35 .",
    "the system is periodic in @xmath21-direction , i.e.  a particle crossing the left / right boundary re - enters the system through the opposite boundary at the same vertical position with unchanged velocities . to impose a uniform shear rate ( @xmath36 ) in the @xmath22-direction , the top and bottom image boxes , bounding the central box ,",
    "are set in motion with velocities @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , in the streamwise direction .",
    "this is the standard approach to attain the state of uniform shear flow ( usf ) by imparting momemtum transfer by shearing , originally introduced by lees & edwards@xmath39 .",
    "overall , this system represents an _ extended doubly - periodic _ system where the periodicity in the transverse direction is in the local lagrangian frame . in a typical simulation , the disks are initially placed randomly in the computational box , and the initial velocity field",
    "is composed of the uniform shear and a small gaussian random part .",
    "an event - driven algorithm is then used to update the system in time , the details of which may be found in alam & luding@xmath40 .    to ascertain whether the system has reached the statistical steady - state , the time evolution of the average fluctuation kinetic energy ( ` granular ' energy , defined in the next section ) is monitored , see fig .",
    "1(@xmath41 ) .",
    "due to the balance between the shear work and the collisional dissipation under homogeneous shear deformation , the granular energy attains a constant value at the steady state .",
    "depending on the value of the coefficient of restitution and the number of particles , it takes about thousand collisions per particle to reach such a statistical steady - state  the lower the value of @xmath18 , the more quickly the system reaches the steady state and _ vice versa_. the simulation is then allowed to run for another @xmath42 collisions per particle to gather data to calculate the macroscopic quantities .",
    "a few longer runs ( 30000 collisions per particle ) were also checked , with no significant change on the measured quantities . another quantity which was simultaneously monitored , along with granular energy , is the linearity of the streamwise velocity profile across the couette gap , and we found that the calculated shear rate ( i.e.   the slope of the velocity profile ) fluctuated around the imposed shear rate by at most @xmath43 at densities where crystallization is not evidenced .      with @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath25 , used as the reference length , time , velocity , and mass , respectively , the relevant dimensionless quantities are : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the ` hydrodynamic ' velocity , @xmath48 the fluctuation ( peculiar ) velocity of particles , @xmath49 the material density of particles , @xmath50 the stress tensor , and @xmath51 the granular energy .",
    "the macroscopic stress , as measured in discrete particle simulations , is a byproduct of the particle - level mechanisms of momemtum transfer . as in the hard - core model of dense gases ,",
    "the stress is the sum of its kinetic and collisional components .",
    "the former arises from the transport of momentum as the particles move through the system carrying their momentum , while the latter is due to the direct interparticle collisions .",
    "the homogeneity of the uniform shear flow allows us to calculate the stress by averaging it over the whole computational box@xmath52 .",
    "the stress , defined in the _ compressive _ sense , may be decomposed in the standard way : @xmath53 where @xmath14 is the pressure , @xmath54 the pressure deviator and @xmath55 the unit tensor . from the off - diagonal components of the pressure deviator",
    ", we can calculate the _ shear viscosity _ which relates the rate of strain to the shear stress : @xmath56 for the steady uniform shear flow , thus , the dimensionless shear viscosity can also be interpreted as the shear stress due to our adopted scaling , @xmath57 .",
    "the diagonal components of the pressure deviator can be non - zero , giving rise to normal stress differences .",
    "the first normal stress difference is defined as @xmath58 note that we have scaled this quantity by pressure to ascertain its relative magnitude with respect to pressure . for a standard newtonian fluid , @xmath59 and",
    "thus @xmath0 is an indicator of the _ non - newtonian _ character of the fluid .",
    "@xmath0 can be decomposed into kinetic and collisional parts : @xmath60    note that the _ sign _ of @xmath0 crucially depends on the convention used to define the stress tensor .",
    "for example , in the rheology literature , stress is typically defined in the _ tensile _ sense@xmath6 .",
    "a positive @xmath0 for the compressive case is equivalent to its negative value for the tensile case and vice versa .",
    "this point should be kept in mind while making any comparison with data in the rheology literature .    from the trace of the kinetic stress tensor , @xmath61",
    ", one can calculate the granular energy , @xmath62 , \\label{eq : genergy1}\\ ] ] which is a measure of the random motion of the particles with respect to the mean motion .",
    "there are two dimensionless control parameters : the volume fraction of particles ( @xmath63 ) and the coefficient of normal restitution ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the shear rate is also a control parameter , however , due to normalization we have @xmath64 , and changing the value of @xmath65 does not influence the reported results ; the imposed shear rate @xmath66 is thus kept fixed at unity .",
    "the simulations are carried out for the whole range of solid volume fractions , varying from the dilute to the dense limit , over a large range of values for the coefficient of restitution ( @xmath67@xmath68 ) . for most of the simulations ,",
    "the number of particles are fixed to @xmath69 , and increasing the value of @xmath70 by fourfold ( @xmath71 ) did not affect the reported quantities noticeably ; for example , the change in @xmath0 was about @xmath72 and @xmath73 at @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , for a restitution coefficient of @xmath76 .",
    "we note here that the system - size dependence of the rheological quantities ( pressure and viscosity ) is known to be strong only for a small number of particles ( @xmath77)@xmath78 .    for the typical simulation in fig .",
    "1(@xmath23 ) , at steady - state , after @xmath79 collisions , the parameter values were @xmath80 , @xmath69 and @xmath81 .",
    "the variations of the granular energy @xmath51 and the calculated shear rate @xmath82 with time are shown in fig .",
    "1(@xmath41 ) , along with corresponding initial variations in two insets . ( the data represent the instantaneous values of @xmath51 and @xmath82 sampled at a regular interval of @xmath83 collisions  no time averaging is involved here . )",
    "note that @xmath82 was computed by binning the system into @xmath84 equal - size bins in the transverse direction and taking averages over all particles in each bin .",
    "it is observed that the granular energy reaches its steady value ( @xmath85 ) quickly after the initial transients and the calculated shear rate fluctuates around its imposed value ( @xmath86 ) by about @xmath87 .",
    "the fluctuations in both @xmath51 and @xmath82 at steady - state are due to the finite - size of the system and diminish with increasing number of particles as @xmath88 .",
    "for detailed results on the quantities pressure , shear viscosity and granular energy , and for their comparison with kinetic theory predictions , we refer to our recent study@xmath89 . here , we will mainly focus on the behaviour of the first normal stress difference and its kinetic and collisional components .",
    "we also present results on the pair distribution function and the collision angle distribution to characterize microstructures .",
    "lastly we will present results on _ crystal_-formation at high densities , signalling the coexistence of fluid and solid , complementing recent results in non - sheared systems@xmath90 .",
    "figure 2(@xmath23 ) shows the variation of the first normal stress difference ( @xmath0 ) with density for two values of the coefficient of restitution .",
    "it is observed that @xmath0 is maximum at the dilute limit and decreases thereafter with @xmath63 .",
    "the overall variation of @xmath0 with density looks similar at other values of the coefficient of restitution , with a difference in the magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "2(@xmath23 ) shows that @xmath0 decreases quite sharply in the dense limit and becomes negative at some density ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "increasing the value of the restitution coefficient decreases this critical density @xmath92 .",
    "the arrows on the left - ordinate indicate the asymptotic values of @xmath0 for a two - dimensional granular gas in the dilute limit@xmath4 : @xmath93 the anisotropy in the second moment of the fluctuation velocity is _ primarily _",
    "responsible for the finite normal stress difference in the dilute limit@xmath94 and this shows up only at the burnett - order of the chapman - enskog expansion@xmath4 .",
    "we should mention here that the limit @xmath95 is singular and the normal stress difference survives even in the elastic limit as pointed out by goldhirsch & sela@xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding expression for @xmath0 in a molecular gas is : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the mean free path and @xmath98 is the rms of the velocity fluctuations .",
    "however , because of its extremely small magnitude under normal conditions , the normal stress difference is not _",
    "measurable _ in a molecular fluid .",
    "previous hard - sphere simulations of campbell and coworkers@xmath99 are in _ variance _ with our result in that they found @xmath100 as @xmath101",
    ". however , the soft - sphere simulations of walton & braun@xmath17 , with frictional particles , support our observation that @xmath0 indeed undergoes a _ sign - reversal_. to better understand what is responsible for the sign - reversal of @xmath0 , we look at the kinetic and collisional components of the first normal stress difference . figure 2(@xmath41 ) shows the variations of @xmath102 and @xmath103 with density at @xmath81 .",
    "we observe that @xmath102 is maximum at the dilute limit and decreases monotonically to zero as @xmath63 approaches the packing limit . except for the dense limit",
    ", the overall behaviour of @xmath102 represents that of the total normal stress difference .",
    "the collisional component , @xmath103 , shows a _ non - monotonic _ variation with density : @xmath103 is zero in the dilute limit , increases with increasing @xmath63 , remains almost constant for intermediate densities , and then decays sharply in the dense limit .",
    "interestingly , @xmath103 becomes negative at some critical density ( @xmath91 ) beyond which the behaviour of @xmath103 mirrors that of @xmath0 ( see inset ) .",
    "thus the normal stress behaviour in the dense regime is clearly due to the anisotropy in the collisional stress .",
    "recall that the kinetic theory of jenkins & richman@xmath94 predicts that @xmath100 in the dense limit .",
    "the predictions of the revised enskog theory of santos _",
    "et al._@xmath104 are in line with that of jenkins & richman , even though their kinetic model is claimed to be valid even in the crystalline - phase . since the source of normal stress differences in all these theories",
    "is linked to the anisotropy in the second moment of velocity fluctuations ( which vanishes as @xmath101 ) , they are unable to predict the correct behaviour of normal stresses in the dense limit .",
    "we would like to stress here that , as mentioned in the introduction , many fascinating non - newtonian effects@xmath6 are primarily determined by the first normal stress difference and its sign .",
    "for example , the rod - climbing effect can occur in a granular fluid if @xmath105 , _ i.e. _ only in the dense limit ( assuming that the second normal stress difference is negligible ) . furthermore , having a constitutive model which reproduces the correct sign of @xmath0 is also important , since it is well known in the rheology literature that the _ odd _ sign for @xmath0 leads to the _ instability _ of the rest state@xmath106 .",
    "the sign - reversal of @xmath103 can be succinctly presented as a phase - diagram in the ( @xmath107)-plane by plotting the zeros of @xmath103 as a function of the coefficient of restitution , see fig .",
    "below the solid line , @xmath103 is positive , and negative above it .",
    "also plotted in this figure is the line for the zeros of @xmath0 which , as expected , lies slightly above .",
    "thus , the first normal stress difference is zero along the solid line which may be called the _ symmetry - line_. it is observed that decreasing the coefficient of restitution increases the critical density ( @xmath92 ) at which @xmath103 changes sign . as we approach the elastic limit , @xmath92 depends strongly on the value of @xmath18 .",
    "we further note that as @xmath95 , @xmath108 which is well below the freezing - point density of a 2d hard - disk fluid , @xmath109@xmath90 .    we need to mention here that the _ sign - change _ of @xmath0 is not uncommon in other non - newtonian fluids .",
    "for example , in non - brownian viscous suspensions , @xmath0 changes sign at high peclet number@xmath110 .",
    "however , the reason for this effect is quite different in granular fluids as we show below .      to understand the microstructural mechanism for the origin of the first normal stress difference and its sign - reversal , here we probe several microstructural features of a dense granular fluid .",
    "typical snapshots of the system in the dense regime are shown in fig . 4 at four different densities with @xmath81 .",
    "note that the density for the subplot 4(@xmath111 ) is @xmath112 for which @xmath113 .",
    "looking at the corresponding distribution of granular energies ( not shown here for brevity ) , we could find signatures of clusters ( group of particles ) with lower energies surrounded by particles with higher energy . to understand the flow - microstructures and their energetics at such high densities , we need to probe the pair distribution function and similar measures for the structure of the packing .",
    "figure 5(@xmath23-@xmath114 ) shows the radial distribution function @xmath115 at four densities , with parameter values as in fig .",
    "4 . the thin , dotted lines are data from a non - sheared , homogeneous , elastic system@xmath90 , whereas the thick , solid lines represent a sheared situation with rather strong dissipation @xmath81 .",
    "( note that the elastic distribution function has been measured under non - sheared periodic boundary conditions ; also for @xmath18 somewhat smaller than unity , the same results were obtained as long as the system remains homogeneous . )",
    "we observe that the weak difference at low density @xmath116 grows with increasing density , concerning two aspects : + ( i ) the peak value of contact in the sheared systems is always larger than that in a homogeneous system of the same density , and the difference increases strongly with density , another indicator for clustering@xmath117 .",
    "+ ( ii ) the peaks and valleys , which allow to distinguish between different lattice structures , are different in the sheared case when compared to the non - sheared situation . in the former case ,",
    "peaks at @xmath118 are observed , signalling shell - formation about any test - particle . in the latter case ,",
    "the peaks at @xmath119 indicate a crystallization transition and the development of a triangular lattice .    the peaks in the sheared situation ,",
    "e.g.  at @xmath120 , become sharper as the density is increased , but the one at @xmath121 is not well - defined even at @xmath122 ; higher order peaks are almost invisible , indicating long - range disorder due to the shearing in contrast to the long - range order that evolves in the non - sheared system .",
    "the comparison between the sheared and non - sheared cases suggest that the structure - formation is much slower in a sheared fluid which , in turn , implies that , as expected , the freezing - point density of the former would be larger than that of the latter .",
    "the splitting of the second - peak in the non - sheared case corresponds to the _ onset _ of freezing transition@xmath123 ; with increasing density this splitting becomes much more prominent , with similar structural - features appearing at the successively higher - order peaks .",
    "for the sheared system , however , we do not observe similar splitting , rather we see a _",
    "sharp _ second - peak .",
    "this also occurs for a highly inelastic sheared fluid at a much lower density@xmath117 ; hence , a sharp second peak is a signature of short - range ordering due to the dissipative particle - clustering .",
    "the higher - order peaks in the sheared case become prominent only if we go beyond @xmath124 , which corresponds to the limit of perfect square - packing , but it is difficult to maintain homogeneous - shearing at such high densities , because the system splits into two parts , a dense , cold , crystalline area and a dilute , hot , fluid area ",
    "see below for details .",
    "figure 6 shows the variations of the pressure and viscosity functions ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively ) with density at a restitution coefficient @xmath81 .",
    "we observe that both increase _ monotonically _ with density , much beyond @xmath127 , and we did not find the _",
    "hysteretic _ van - der - walls loop in our pressure data upto @xmath124 , another indication that the crystallization is hindered / delayed by shear .",
    "these observations , together with our result that in the elastic limit @xmath0 changes sign at a much lower density ( @xmath128 , see fig .",
    "3 ) than the corresponding freezing - density , suggest that the sign - reversal of @xmath0 is not related to the freezing - transition .      associated with the _ sign - reversal _ of the first normal stress difference",
    "is a change in the relative magnitudes of the normal stress components ( @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) .",
    "subtle changes in the direction and magnitudes of the collisional - mode of momemtum transfer could influence the individual components of the stress tensor . in order to test this hypothesis",
    ", we focus on the collision angle distribution function , @xmath131 , which is defined such that @xmath132 is the probability of collisions occuring at an angle lying between @xmath133 and @xmath134 , with the angle @xmath133 being measured in the anticlockwise direction from the positive @xmath135-axis ( see fig . 13 ) . for a fluid in equilibrium ,",
    "all collisions are equally likely , and hence @xmath131 is a uniform function of @xmath133 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath136 . for a non - equilibrium system ( e.g. shear flow ) , however , preferred collisions are dictated by the nature of the external field , leading to an anisotropic distribution for @xmath131@xmath137 . following savage & jeffrey@xmath138 and campbell & brennen@xmath139 , an explicit expression for @xmath140",
    "can be derived for the case of uniform shear flow as detailed in the appendix .",
    "note that the angular dependence of @xmath141 will be modified by both the density and the restitution coefficient .",
    "figure 7 shows the comparison of our simulation data on @xmath131 with the theoretical predictions of equation ( [ eqn_colang1 ] ) for two different values of the restitution coefficient at a density @xmath116 .",
    "it is observed that the probability of collisions is higher on the _ upstream_-faces of the colliding particles , i.e. for @xmath142 $ ] and @xmath143 $ ] ( i.e. the hatched - areas on the test - particle in fig .",
    "this is a consequence of the imposed shear - field which compresses the flow - structure along the @xmath144-direction and stretches it along the @xmath145-direction . regarding the comparison with theory , there is , clearly , a phase - difference between theory and simulation , and the overall agreement is only qualitative .",
    "note in fig .",
    "7 that the probability of collisions on the upstream - faces increases further as the restitution coefficient increases .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that particle motion becomes more _ streamlined _",
    "( i.e. along the streamwise direction ) with increasing dissipation levels , which will naturally lead to a reduction in the transverse component of the fluctuation velocities of the particles .",
    "thus , the _ macroscopic _ manifestation of such _ microscopic _ streamlined - motion would be an increase in the magnitude of the kinetic component of the first normal stress difference ( @xmath102 ) .    turning our attention to the range of densities where @xmath0 undergoes a sign - reversal ,",
    "we show the collision angle distributions @xmath131 in fig .",
    "8 as polar plots with @xmath81 ; the corresponding densities are as in the subplots of fig .",
    "it is observed that the _ anisotropic _ structure of @xmath131 gets further modified in this regime , with distinct peaks appearing near @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( see subplot @xmath41 ) .",
    "while the peak at @xmath146 corresponds to _ head - on _ collisions between particles in the same - layer , the one at @xmath148 clearly signals the _ onset _ of triangular - structure formation .",
    "another noteworthy point is that the collisions on the downstream - faces of the colliding particles are _ rare _ at these densities and hence @xmath131 can be approximated solely by its contributions from the second- and fourth - quadrants ( @xmath142 $ ] and @xmath149 $ ] , respectively ) .",
    "since the momentum transfer occurs mainly due to collisions in the dense regime , the stress tensor can be approximated by @xmath150 where @xmath35 is the unit vector joining the line of centres of the two colliding disks .",
    "assuming now that all the collisions would occur at some average collision angle @xmath151 so that @xmath152 , and recalling that @xmath131 is well represented in this regime by restricting @xmath133 only in the second- and fourth - quadrants , the expression for the first normal stress difference simplifies significantly to @xmath153_{\\theta=\\theta_{av } } c(\\theta_{av}).\\ ] ] it is trivial to check that @xmath59 at @xmath154 . from our simulation data ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath151 by averaging @xmath131 over the second- and fourth - quadrants , whose variation with density is plotted in fig .",
    "9 for two restitution coefficients .",
    "it is observed that @xmath151 crosses through @xmath155 ( i.e. @xmath144 ) at around the critical density @xmath156 for all restitution coefficients .",
    "for example , @xmath157 and @xmath158 at @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively , where @xmath0 changes sign .",
    "thus , the microstructural signature of the sign - reversal of @xmath0 is directly correlated with the _ average _ collision angle being greater or less than @xmath155 ( or @xmath144 ) .",
    "figure 10(@xmath23 ) shows a snapshot of the system at the steady state with parameter values being set to @xmath161 and @xmath76 .",
    "it is observed that a solid - layer coexists with two fluidized zones on either side of it",
    ". a closer look into the solid - layer reveals that the particles are arranged in a triangular - packing , representing a _ crystal _ , and thus we have a clear evidence for _ fluid - solid _ coexistence . the corresponding _ instantaneous _ streamwise velocity profile at @xmath162 ( i.e. the image - boxes have moved @xmath163 strain units from their original position ) is shown in fig .",
    "10(@xmath41 ) ; the coarse - graining is done by binning the system into 20 equal - size bins in the transverse direction and then taking averages over all the particles in each bin .",
    "clearly , the shearing is _ inhomogeneous _ across the couette - gap : the crystal is aligned along the streamwise direction and hence we call it a _",
    "layered_-crystal ; the shear - rate in the fluidized regimes on either side of the crystal is almost uniform .",
    "note that the _ asymmetric _ nature of the velocity profile also signals the breakdown of the lees - edwards boundary condition as a motor for the homogeneous shear .",
    "the formation and the time - evolution of this crystal can be ascertained from fig .",
    "10(@xmath111 ) which shows the corresponding evolution of the streamwise velocity at early times .",
    "we observe that the crystal has fully formed at @xmath164 , and the velocity profile remains antisymmetric about @xmath165 till @xmath166 . with further time - evolution ,",
    "however , the crystal does not remain stationary in the transverse direction , rather it moves slowly with particles diffusing across the fluid - solid interface .",
    "the overall life - time of this crystal is several orders of magnitude larger than the external time - scale @xmath167 , imposed by the shear .",

    "note that the peak at @xmath169 does not exist in the fluid phase ( refer to figs .",
    "8@xmath23 ) , and this provides evidence that the particles in the crystalline - phase are arranged in the triangular - packing structure .",
    "the large area of the crystalline phase as well as its relatively large value of solids fraction ( hence , small mean free time ) further suggest that most of the collisions occurred in the crystalline - phase .",
    "we should remark here that , at such high densities , the _ inelastic collapse_@xmath170 would eventually terminate the evolution of the system .",
    "we used the tc - model@xmath171 to avoid inelastic collapse , but could not altogether eliminate it within the crystal after some time .",
    "but the important point to note is that the crystalline - phase can be maintained for a long period of time ( @xmath172 strain units ) , and hence the reported results are not transient effects .",
    "analogous plots for a nearly elastic system ( @xmath173 ) are shown in fig .",
    "11(@xmath23@xmath111 ) for the same density @xmath161 .",
    "the overall features are similar to that for @xmath76 , but the width of the crystalline zone is a little larger . by decreasing the dissipation - level to @xmath81 , we did not observe crystal formation , with other parameters being fixed ; by increasing the system - size to @xmath71 , however , we observed layered crystal at @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the formation of such layered - crystalline structure depends crucially on the system size and the dissipation level : _ the larger the system - size and/or the weaker the dissipation , the more susceptible the system is to crystallize_.    note that even if we are well below the limit of perfect square - packing ( @xmath174 ) , the system could crystallize if the dissipation - levels are low ; for example , we observed layered crystalline structures at @xmath122 with @xmath173 and @xmath71 .",
    "decreasing the coefficient of restitution to @xmath76 , the flow - field remained homogeneous .",
    "thus , our layered crystalline structures appear to be tied to a _ long - wave _ instability of the elastic hard - sphere fluids@xmath175 . since our results are not driven by the inelastic dissipation , they are distinctly different from the layered shear - banding patterns , as predicted by the kinetic theory models@xmath176 , in granular couette flows .",
    "having said that we need to mention that such _ dissipative _ layering patterns ( i.e. those which become stronger with increasing dissipation levels@xmath177 ) were also found in simulations of a dilute sheared granular fluid@xmath178 , but the simulations were allowed to evolve from an _ unsheared _ initial configuration with a special kind of boundary condition . in contrast , all our simulations started from a uniform shear condition . in the present contribution , we have mainly focussed on the non - dissipative layering in the dense limit , and the related issues of dissipative layering are relegated to a future study .    before moving further",
    ", we make a qualitative comparison with the earlier simulation work of campbell & brennen@xmath139 on the bounded couette flow of inelastic , frictional hard disks .",
    "they also reported similar layered - microstructure but due to the small system - size ( @xmath179 ) and boundary - effects ( they considered a shear - flow bounded by frictional walls ) , the distinct shear - band formation that we have reported is not evident in the snapshots of their simulations .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that our results are akin to that reported by campbell & brennen .",
    "one of the referees has drawn our attention to the recent work of campbell@xmath180 who probed the dense limit of a three - dimensional couette shear flow using soft - sphere simulations .",
    "he was able to maintain uniform shearing even at a density of @xmath181 , but beyond that he reported shear - band formation in that the flow - field degenerates into sheared and non - sheared zones in the gradient direction .",
    "this simply suggests that one can maintain uniform shearing in a three - dimensional geometry even beyond the analogous square - packing limit ( @xmath182 ) since the particles have now an additional degree of freedom , orthogonal to the shear plane , to rearrange themselves .",
    "moreover , most of campbell s simulations were done with @xmath183 particles ( equivalently , @xmath184 particles in 2d ) at a restitution coefficient of @xmath185 . with these parameter values ,",
    "we did not find layered crystals at @xmath161 in two - dimensions ( see discussion in the next section ) .",
    "one of the referees has drawn our attention to the recent work of lutsko@xmath186 who studied the shear - induced ordering in a low - density ( @xmath187 ) elastic hard - sphere fluid .",
    "the earliest simulations of erpenbeck@xmath188 on 3d elastic hard - sphere fluids showed that at high shear rates the system breaks down into orderded ( solid ) and disordered ( fluid ) phases in the direction of the mean vorticity ( i.e. normal to the shear - plane ) .",
    "this induces a long - range two - dimensional ordering , called a _ string - phase _ , in the shear - plane .",
    "more importantly , such ordering occurs only for a range of shear - rates the lower the density , the larger this shear - rate interval .",
    "however , the latter work of evans and morriss@xmath189 showed that the disorder - order transition of erpenbeck arises due to the profile - biased - thermostat@xmath189 since the string - phase vanishes completely when a profile - unbiased - thermostat@xmath189 is used .",
    "thus , the shear - induced - ordering in elastic hard - sphere fluids appears to depend on the choice of the thermostat .",
    "note further that all the above works probed moderately dense systems only , well below the corresponding square - packing limit . now to compare these results with our observations in granular fluids , we first need to define an equivalent shear rate since the granular energy and the shear rate are dependent on each other for the latter system . from the energy balance equation ,",
    "it is trivial to show that the granular energy has the following functional relation with the shear rate and the restitution coefficient : @xmath190 where @xmath191 is defined as the _ reduced shear rate_. in the quasielastic limit ( @xmath95 ) the reduced shear rate ( and hence the granular energy ) approaches infinity , which is equivalent to the high shear - rate limit of an elastic hard - sphere fluid . since we observed layered crystalline structures only in the quasielastic limit , we may thus conclude that such structures would also persist in elastic hard - disk fluids at large shear rates .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the layered crystalline - structures of figs . 10 and 11 are , in any way , related to the concept of the reynold s dilatancy@xmath15 which is explained schematically in fig .",
    "the top two sketches depict the classical _ constant - load_@xmath192 shear - cell experiment ( in two - dimensions ) in which the material is subjected to a constant normal load .",
    "12(@xmath23 ) corresponds to an ideal situation of maximum packing , with the particles being arranged in a triangular lattice ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "clearly , in this situation the top and the bottom plates of the shear cell will simply slide over the material , without deforming it .",
    "however , if one of the plates is allowed to move in the vertical direction and thereby allowing the particles to rearrange themselves , e.g. as in fig .",
    "12(@xmath41 ) , the material can be deformed even homogeneously ( if @xmath194 ) .",
    "this is the _ shear - coupled volume change _ , commonly known as the reynold s dilatancy .",
    "note , however , that our simulations mimic _ constant - volume _ experiments , since the volume of the computational box remains fixed ( see figs . 12@xmath111 and 12@xmath114 ) ; but , of course , now the pressure ( i.e. normal load ) can vary in response to particle motions inside the shear cell . for this case also , the uniform shearing is possible if and only if the overall density remains below the square - packing limit ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "however , for densities above this value ( @xmath196 ) , the shearing can be started only if we allow the particles to rearrange themselves .",
    "this is possible if a part of the system becomes denser , allowing _",
    "free _ volumes to the rest of the system which is nothing but reynold s dilatancy too .",
    "hence , we will end up with a crystalline - phase coexisting with a fluid phase , a typical example of which is shown schematically in fig .",
    "12(@xmath114 ) .",
    "thus the phenomenon of reynold s dilatancy , for densities @xmath196 , would make the _ ordering _ transition , as depicted in figs .",
    "10 and 11 , more prominent , and this effect would be much stronger in two - dimensions .",
    "here we attempt to describe the normal - stress behaviour of a granular fluid using the standard relaxation - type models .",
    "prior literature on the dense - gas kinetic theory , which forms the foundation of theoretical developments of granular fluids in the _ rapid - shear _ regime , indicates that such a stress relaxation mechanism does also exist in granular fluids@xmath197 .",
    "the relaxation - type models are routinely used to describe the non - newtonian behaviour of viscoelastic / viscoplastic materials , and hence might be apt for granular fluids in the dense limit as well .",
    "the recent work of zhang & rauenzahn@xmath198 clearly shows that such viscoelastic stress relaxation mechanism exists in dense granular flows . following a rigorous statistical mechanical procedure , they derived an evolution equation for the collisional stress tensor which boils down to a frame - indifferent viscoelastic model , with the jaumann derivative appearing directly without appealing to objectivity arguments .",
    "let us consider the viscoelastic relaxation approximation suggested recently by jin & slemrod@xmath199 to regularize the burnett order equations of sela & goldhirsch@xmath200 for a low - density granular fluid .",
    "their proposed equation for the pressure deviator , in our notation , is @xmath201 where @xmath202 here @xmath203 and @xmath204 are relaxation times , @xmath114 the dimensionality of the system , @xmath205 is the velocity gradient , @xmath206 the deviatoric part of the rate of strain tensor , @xmath207 the shear viscosity , @xmath208 the bulk viscosity and @xmath209 the identity tensor ; @xmath210 and @xmath211 are higher order terms , explicitly written down in jin & slemrod@xmath199 .",
    "note that both relaxation times are proportional to the ratio of the shear viscosity and the pressure , and hence proportional to the mean free time . in the limits of @xmath203 , @xmath212 and @xmath210 , @xmath213",
    ", we recover the standard newtonian model for the stress tensor .    neglecting the higher - order terms , an expression for the first normal stress difference",

    "it is important to note that the above evolution equation does not satisfy the _ principle of material frame indifference _ ( mfi ) which states that the constitutive laws should be _ invariant _ under rigid - rotation@xmath215 .",
    "the scalar field @xmath216 , the vector field @xmath217 and the tensor field @xmath218 are called _ frame - indifferent _ or _ objective _ if the following relations hold for all @xmath219 : @xmath220 where @xmath216 , @xmath217 & @xmath218 and @xmath221 , @xmath222 & @xmath223 are defined in two different frames @xmath224 and @xmath225 , respectively , and @xmath226 is a proper orthogonal tensor .",
    "here @xmath227 , with @xmath228 denoting the set of all frames obtainable from a given frame @xmath224 by observer transformations .",
    "that the stress - tensor in a granular gas is not a frame - independent quantity ( as in the hard - sphere gas@xmath229 ) is well - known .",
    "since the kinetic component of the first normal stress difference remains positive at all densities , the kinetic stress tensor can be modelled using a non - objective equation as discussed above .",
    "for the collisional stress tensor , one can postulate a similar evolution equation as in eqn .",
    "( 11 ) , but @xmath203 must be multiplied by a factor which must change sign at the critical density . however , this equation would remain frame - dependent even in the dense limit .",
    "thus , if one has to recover the boltzmann - limit of relaxation - type equations , a frame - indifferent approach does not appear to work .",
    "a question now arises as to the possibility of modelling normal stress differences using the standard frame - indifferent relaxation type models .",
    "the simplest way is to use either the _ lower - convected _ or the _ upper - convected _",
    "equations for the pressure deviator : @xmath230 respectively . here",
    "@xmath231 is an empirical constant , dependent on both the density and restitution coefficient . for both cases , the first normal stress difference is @xmath232 clearly ,",

    ", we conclude that the loss of frame - indifference shows up as a _ sign - change _ of the first normal stress difference",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate whether one could relax the sela - goldhirsch equations@xmath233 using a frame - indifferent approach without violating the entropy inequality@xmath199 .",
