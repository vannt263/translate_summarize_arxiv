    "<S> we show how to control the field profile on a sub - wavelength scale using a customised permittivity variation in a functional medium , thus avoiding the need to e.g. synthesize the shape from its fourier harmonics . for applications such as beam dynamics , requiring field profile shaping in free space , we show that it is possible to achieve this despite using a slot in the medium .    </S>",
    "<S> we show how we can use layered or varying material properties to sculpt the electric field profile along the propagation direction . here </S>",
    "<S> we use _ sub - wavelength _ variation as a means of controlling the internal field profile @xcite , in contrast to the typical uses of layered @xcite or chirped @xcite 1d photonic crystals , whose focus is primarily on manipulating the band structure , reflectivity , or transmission properties . up to now </S>",
    "<S> most of the work has concentrated on photonic band gaps in photonic crystals , and the transmission or reflection coefficients at various angles or frequencies of an incident wave @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our method is also distinct from the synthesis of optical waveforms by combining carefully phased harmonics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> many possibilities are unlocked by our ability to design field profiles with sub - wavelength customization . </S>",
    "<S> we might imagine enhancing ionization in high harmonic generation ( hhg , see e.g. @xcite and citations thereof ) , where the field profile aims to give a detailed control of the ionized electrons trajectory and recollision . </S>",
    "<S> further , we might create localized peaks in the waveform , so that the concentration of optical power enhances the signal to noise ratio , or gives a larger nonlinear effect . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , flatter profiles could help minimise unwanted nonlinear effects , or better localise the sign transition as happens for a square wave signal . in accelerator applications </S>",
    "<S> , there is much interest in controlling the size and/or shape of electron bunches ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or for pre - injection plasma ionisation for laser wakefield acceleration @xcite ; sculpted electric field profiles are one way of achieving the desired level of control .    of course , when using customised field profiles to control an electron bunch in an accelerator or synchrotron , we need that field profile to be present in free space . </S>",
    "<S> we address this important case using a gap between two slabs of the necessary customised medium , and use @xcite simulations of this arrangement to demonstrate that the desired field profile is still present within the slot . </S>",
    "<S> a slot also enables probes to be placed to measure the electric field , and can increase the transmission of external fields into the medium .    to motivate our scheme we first consider assuming ( or guessing ) some promising dielectic function @xmath0 , and solving the wave equation for @xmath1 under those conditions , and varying the parameters to search for a suitable field profile . by selecting a simple material variation </S>",
    "<S> we could make use of existing solutions ; notably repeating two - layer structure would allow us to repurpose work on ( e.g. ) bragg reflectors . </S>",
    "<S> more interesting would be to assume a sinusoidal variation in permittivity , which has a wave equation that matches that for mathieu functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the periodic mathieu functions depend on two parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the @xmath5-th characteristic value . </S>",
    "<S> these give solutions of the differential equation for @xmath6   @xmath7    a_{n , q}(z ) & =    0 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] sample mathieu functions , with parameters chosen to give both flat - topped and triangular profiles are shown compared to other similar ( but explicitly designed ) profiles on fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_both ] .    </S>",
    "<S> however , although mathieu functions and the like are powerful sources of inspiration , we prefer to follow a design - lead scheme where we first specify the desired field profile @xmath1 , then use the wave equation to calcuate what the position dependent dielectric properties @xmath0 needs to be . in principle </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to directly calculate the material function needed to support almost any electric field profile we might want .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the single frequency transverse mode with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , together with the permittivity @xmath11 and vacuum permeability @xmath12 . then maxwell s equations , where @xmath13 , give @xmath14    in principle almost any electric field profile is possible . </S>",
    "<S> however , for some field profiles , the solution in requires the presence of negative permittivities , possibly with a very high absolute value ; in others @xmath15 is undefined .    </S>",
    "<S> further , in order to design a simpler structure for the numerical simulations , we choose our permittivity function so that @xmath16 , and that @xmath17 does not change rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the @xmath18 and that when @xmath19 then @xmath20 , i.e. a point of inflection . to simplify the modelling we restrict ourselves to modes with odd symmetry about @xmath21 and @xmath22 and hence even symmetry about @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the desired wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath25 thus it is only necessary to specify @xmath26 for @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry requirements imply @xmath28 and @xmath29 . from & one </S>",
    "<S> see that @xmath17 has period half that of @xmath30 , and has even symmetry about @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is advantageous for the electric field to be composed of piecewise sections which are either sinusoidal , and hence correspond to constant @xmath17 , or linear , which correspond to @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> following this theoretical design step , we validate our scheme using 3d cst simulations based on a rod - like unit cell oriented along @xmath33 , with a nearly square cross section in @xmath34 and @xmath35 . on the @xmath34 boundary we set a perfect magnetic conductor ( i.e. @xmath36 ) , and on the @xmath35 boundary we have a perfect electric conductor ( i.e. @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath33 boundary conditions are periodic with a phase shift of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we choose these boundary conditions since if we instead used all periodic conditions , then spurious modes with finite @xmath39 or @xmath40 transverse to the variation ( in @xmath33 ) would appear .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we confine ourselves to consider only material variation that has a strictly positive - valued permittivity everywhere . in part </S>",
    "<S> , this is because materials with negative permittivity are typically strongly dispersive , and so there may be  at the very least  </S>",
    "<S> stringent bandwidth limitations . with this constraint , and for some choices of profile </S>",
    "<S> , it can be more difficult to construct the permittivity function that supports an electric field with sufficient accuracy .    nevertheless , by using materials with very low permittivity @xmath41 ( epsilon near zero , enz ) </S>",
    "<S> , one can construct profiles which are ( e.g. ) almost flat for a significant proportion of the mode , or which have near constant gradient  both being shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_both ] . </S>",
    "<S> these profiles were inspired by mathieu functions of similar appearance , but as we found , that general appearance does not require the specific sinusoidal @xmath41 variation needed for the mathieu functions themselves . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , profiles with strongly localised peaks can be achieved by combining two materials of significantly different permittivities , and if one is prepared to tolerate less precise profiles , it may be possible to construct reasonable flat - top and triangular profiles using only materials with @xmath42 . for brevity , here we will consider only the four representative profiles indicated in table [ trans_table ] .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1 # 1    a flat - topped , or quasi square - wave profile is a familiar waveform , and is often encountered in digital switching circuits , being naturally of a binary ( two - level ) form . </S>",
    "<S> the fast square - wave transitions are ideal for triggering actions at precisely determined intervals ; alternatively its periods of near constant field are ideal for applying a ( nearly ) identical force to each charged particle in a bunch . </S>",
    "<S> however , to synthesize this profile directly from its many harmonic components would require a significant effort , esecially if attempting to build an optical square wave ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , using our technique we can sidestep that effort by constructing instead a designer functional material that quite naturally supports such waveforms . </S>",
    "<S> we can generate our flat - top wave profile using   @xmath43 for @xmath44 , with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> we implemented this structure in , based on a unit cell with cross section @xmath46 mm , @xmath47 mm and length @xmath48 mm . </S>",
    "<S> the slot , when present , was @xmath49 mm wide . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_both ] demonstrates that the designed - for field profile is achievable even in a 3d simulation ; a 3d visualization is given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_both_cst ] .    a field profile with a triangular form , just like a square wave or indeed any waveform can be synthesized from its harmonics . in comparison to the square wave in particular , though , the proportion of higher harmonics falls off more rapidly , so any synthesis would in practise be easier . this ramped field profile could also be used to impart a well - managed linear chirp to charged particles in a bunch .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , here we can design a structure which naturally supports triangular waves , which is given by @xmath50 where @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , and let @xmath51 be the lowest solution to @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we implemented this structure in , based on the same unit cell as for the flat - top wave ; except that when present the slot width was @xmath53 mm . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_both ] demonstrates that the designed - for field profile is achievable even in a full 3d simulation . </S>",
    "<S> a 3d visualization is given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_both_cst ] .    </S>",
    "<S> a saw - tooth profile could be created in a similar manner by using an enz material for the linearly increasing section of the wave , and then a relatively high permittivity segment for the short near - vertical connecting part . </S>",
    "<S> such a wave profile was suggested as a gradient gating way of optimising hhg @xcite ; the idea being that the initial strong field could ionize a gas atom and accelerate the electron away , before returning to the nucleus to recombine and emit high - energy photons . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent work has focussed on optimising the field profiles on the basis of detailed models of the ionization process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given such a wave profile , our method could be used to design a structure to generate it  although tolerating the intense laser pulses used would be a challenge .    </S>",
    "<S> waveforms with strongly localized peaks can also be useful , particularly where an amplitude and/or intensity threshold is the chosen discriminator . </S>",
    "<S> however , just like any wave with distinct or localized features , they have a significant harmonic content and we might therefore prefer not to synthesize them directly . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , as we have noted , long intervals of a near - constant electric field in a waveform require very small permittivity values ( i.e. the enz regime ) . to avoid this complication </S>",
    "<S> , we might replace an idealized near - constant region with many low - amplitude rapid oscillations that are assumed to cycle - average to zero .      </S>",
    "<S> we might also want to generate a peaked profile with many fewer minor oscillations per half - period . </S>",
    "<S> however , this can not be achieved with only slabs of constant @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , something closer to the design goal _ can _ be made if we construct an @xmath26 using two sinusoidal regions and a quadratic bezier function @xmath58 to interpolate between them . with @xmath59 from , </S>",
    "<S> this profile is @xmath60 for this construction the challenge now becomes that the permittivity becomes very large in a small region ; the required @xmath17 can be seen in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_peak_2o ] . </S>",
    "<S> further , even before any difficulties of fabricating an experimental structure are considered , generating numerical results for this is problematic . </S>",
    "<S> we can see in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_peak_2o ] the results of using to generate a field profile in comparison to the designed - for wave shape  there are significant regions where the match is rather poor . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the general character of the desired wave profile is achieved , and the important high - field peaks _ are _ closely matched .    </S>",
    "<S> having first considered theoretical structures based on an infinitely periodic representation , we now move to the finite structures of the kind most likely to be built . </S>",
    "<S> one practical feature of our scheme  the free space field wave profile shaping using a slot  has already been demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves two important issues : ( a ) to what extent does the profile shaping persist for a small or finite number of repetitions ? ( b ) will an incident field be transmitted effectively into the structure for modulation ? </S>",
    "<S> since the structural periodicity is a good match to the incident wavelength , any device _ might _ be expected to act more like a bragg mirror . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we adapted our simulations to treat finite - period structures .    </S>",
    "<S> the left hand panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_flat_bandtrans ] shows a comparision of the bandstructures for the flat - top wave structure with and without a slot . </S>",
    "<S> we can easily see that the character of the bandstructures is preserved and that the slot - induced upward frequency shift is relatively small . </S>",
    "<S> this trend was repeated in simulations for our other slotted structures .    </S>",
    "<S> since the field profiles and bandstructure do not deteriorate when a slot is present , we can turn to the second question , i.e. whether or not an incident field of the correct / desired operating frequency will be transmitted through the structure and be modulated in the desired way . that we _ can _ do this </S>",
    "<S> is shown by the right hand panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_flat_bandtrans ] , where we see the reflectivity spectrum for a multiple period structures with and without a slot . as a direct result of our design process , we see that the presence of a slot  and perhaps despite its sub - wavelength width  </S>",
    "<S> enhances transmission into the structure .    _ in summary , </S>",
    "<S> _ we have demonstrated a considerable freedom to customise electric field profiles , even in free - space , and without resorting to harmonic synthesis . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by the use of a customised periodic structure with an engineered permittivity profile based on functional materials . </S>",
    "<S> the material permittivity function needed can be based either on known solutions , such as specific mathieu functions , or more generally calculated directly from the wave equation . </S>",
    "<S> we have validated our theoretical conception by implementing sample structures in , checked that ( i ) they generate a field profile that matches the design , ( ii ) that the profiling can be achieved in free - space by means of a slotted structure , and ( iii ) that the desired field modes inside the structure can be excited .    </S>",
    "<S> in future work we aim to investigate more realistic models of our structures . </S>",
    "<S> further , it seems likely that this scheme can be adapted to other fields such as acoustics . </S>"
