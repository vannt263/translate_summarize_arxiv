    "the moons of giant planets in the solar system can be divided into several categories .",
    "the _ regular _ moons are large , roughly spherical satellites on nearly circular orbits that are aligned with the host planet s equator .",
    "they are thought to have formed by complex accretion processes in the circumplanetary disk ( canup & ward 2002 , mosqueira & estrada 2003 ) .",
    "irregular _ moons are smaller , irregularly shaped satellites with large , eccentric , inclined , and often retrograde orbits .",
    "they are though to have been captured from heliocentric orbits ( e.g. , nesvorn et al .",
    "in addition , there are the ring moons , neptune s triton , etc . , which are not the main focus here .",
    "saturn s moon iapetus has a special status among the planetary satellites .",
    "its physical properties , including the large size ( diameter @xmath7 km ) , nearly spherical figure and synchronous rotation , are characteristic of a regular moon .",
    "its orbit , however , is unusual in that it is transitional between those of the regular and irregular satellites .",
    "the regular moons , on one hand , have their orbital precession controlled by the quadrupole potential of the host planet s equatorial bulge , and by their mutual interaction .",
    "the irregular moons , instead , have their orbital precession driven by solar gravity .",
    "the transition between these two regimes occurs near the laplace radius , @xmath8 , defined as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are planet s mass , physical radius , semimajor axis and eccentricity , @xmath14 is the solar mass , and @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the quadrupole coefficient , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mass and semimajor axis of a satellite , and index @xmath19 goes over @xmath20 inner satellites",
    ".    for saturn , @xmath21 , and for iapetus , @xmath22 , mainly contributed by titan . with the semimajor axis @xmath23 @xmath11 , iapetus is therefore just outside the laplace radius , @xmath24 @xmath11 .",
    "none of other regular or irregular satellites is as close to the laplace radius .",
    "the regular satellites have @xmath25 , and their nodal precession is roughly uniform with respect to the planet s equator .",
    "the irregular satellites have @xmath26 and their nodal precession is roughly uniform with respect to the orbital plane of their host planet .    in the transition region , @xmath27 ,",
    "the uniform precession occurs with respect to a surface , known as the _ laplace surface _",
    ", that is intermediate between the equatorial and orbital planes .",
    "the angle between the planetary spin axis and the normal to the laplace surface , @xmath28 , is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the host planet obliquity ( tremaine et al .",
    "2009 ) . for saturn s present obliquity , @xmath31 , and the orbital distance of iapetus ,",
    "this gives @xmath32 , roughly half way between the equatorial and orbital planes .",
    "the mean orbital eccentricity of iapetus is @xmath330.03 and its mean inclination to the laplace surface is @xmath338@xmath6 ( figure [ real ] ) .",
    "if it formed from a circumplanetary disk , one would expect iapetus to have zero eccentricity and inclination relative to this surface .",
    "it thus appears that some process has pumped up iapetus s inclination while leaving its eccentricity near zero .",
    "ward ( 1981 ) pointed out that the shape of the laplace surface is affected by the mass of the circumplanetary disk , and suggested that the current orbit of iapetus reflects its shape before the disk dispersed .",
    "however , this scenario requires a fast dispersal of the disk in @xmath34  yr .",
    "if the dispersal were slower , the inclination relative to the laplace surface would behave as an adiabatic invariant and would thus remain near zero .",
    "the excitation of iapetus s inclination could have instead occurred when saturn obtained its substantial obliquity .",
    "for this to work the obliquity would need to be tilted on a timescale comparable to iapetus s nodal precession period ( currently @xmath35 yr ) .",
    "unfortunately , all processes proposed thus far to explain saturn s obliquity act too fast ( tremaine 1991 ) or too slow ( hamilton & ward 2004 , ward & hamilton 2004 ) for this to be plausible .    here",
    "we study the possibility that iapetus s inclination was risen to its current value during the ( hypothesized ) dynamical instability in the outer solar system when scattering encounters of saturn with ice giants happened ( tsiganis et al .",
    "2005 ) . our model for dynamical perturbations of the satellite orbits in realistic instability simulations",
    "is explained in section 2 .",
    "the results are discussed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we study the subsequent evolution of iapetus s orbit to the present epoch .",
    "section 5 concludes this paper .",
    "several properties of the solar system , including the wide radial spacing and orbital eccentricities of the giant planets , can be explained if the early solar system evolved through a dynamical instability followed by migration of planets in the planetesimal disk ( malhotra 1993 , thommes et al . 1999 , tsiganis et al .",
    "recently , we developed new instability / migration models ( nesvorn & morbidelli 2012 ; hereafter nm12 ) , whose initial conditions were tightly linked to our expectations for planet formation in the protoplanetary nebula .",
    "we recently used these models to study the orbital behavior of the terrestrial planets during the instability ( brasser et al . 2013 ) , capture of jupiter trojans and irregular satellites ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2013 , 2014 ) , and survival of the galilean satellites at jupiter ( deienno et al . 2014 ) .",
    "here we work with ten cases taken from nm12 .",
    "cases 1 , 2 and 3 were illustrated in nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2013 , their figures 1 - 4 ) .",
    "figure [ case8 ] shows the evolution of planets in case 4 .",
    "table [ ten ] lists the main properties of these simulations .",
    "note that these cases were selected solely based on their success in reproducing the orbital properties of the solar system planets ( see nm12 ) .",
    "we therefore did not have any a priori knowledge of what consequences to expect in these cases for the satellite orbits .",
    "in all cases considered here , the solar system was assumed to have five giant planets initially ( jupiter , saturn and three ice giants ) .",
    "this is because nm12 showed that having five planets initially is a convenient way to satisfy constraints .",
    "the third ice giant with the mass comparable to that of uranus or neptune is ejected into interstellar space during the instability ( see also nesvorn 2011 , batygin et al .",
    "a shared property of the selected runs is that saturn undergoes a series of encounters with the ejected ice giant .",
    "for each planetary encounter ( in all selected cases ) we recorded the position and velocity vectors of all planets . only encounters with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the distance of planets during the encounter , and",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are their hill radii , were considered .",
    "the number of these encounters for saturn is shown in table [ ten ] . in cases 6 and 10 ,",
    "saturn had the lowest ( 14 ) and highest ( 64 ) number of encounters , respectively . to determine the effect of these encounters on iapetus , we used the recorded states and performed a second set of integrations where iapetus and titan were included .",
    "this was done as follows .",
    "first , planets were integrated backward in time from the first encounter recorded in the previous integration .",
    "this new integration was stopped when @xmath40 au . at this point ,",
    "titan and iapetus were inserted in the integration .",
    "we assumed that the initial orbits of both satellites were perfectly circular and on the laplace surface .",
    "the semimajor axes were set to their current values ( @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath42).10% during scattering encounters , because the results obtained with slightly different initial semimajor axis values are found to be similar . ]",
    "saturn s oblateness and gravity of the inner moons up to enceladus were included in the forward simulation via the effective quadrupole term @xmath44 ( eq . [ j2prime ] ) .",
    "the orbits of planets and satellites were propagated forward in time , through the encounter , and up to the point when @xmath40 au again .",
    "we used the bulirsch - stoer integrator with a step @xmath45  days , which is roughly 1/100 of titan s orbital period .",
    "once this part was over , we removed the ice giant that participated in the encounter ( to avoid any additional encounters during the interim period ) , and continued integrating the orbits of planets and satellites toward the next encounter .",
    "ideally , we would like to smoothly join this integration with that corresponding to the next encounter .",
    "this is , unfortunately , impossible with our current setup that ignores the gravitational effects of planetesimals ( while planetesimals were included in the original simulations ) .",
    "therefore , even if we integrated the planetary orbits all the way to the next encounter , the position and velocity vectors at that time would not be the same as the ones in the original simulation .    as a compromise",
    ", we opted to respect the recorded time interval to the next encounter , @xmath46 , if @xmath47 yr , or integrate to @xmath48 - 7000 yr if @xmath49 yr .",
    "the integration time cutoff was implemented to economize the cpu time .",
    "this should be correct as long as the timing of encounters is uncorrelated with the orbital phase of the two satellites , which should be a reasonable assumption .",
    "the integration was terminated randomly between @xmath48 and 7000 yr to assure that the timing of the next encounter was uncorrelated with the phase of iapetus s nodal recession .",
    "the orbits of satellites at the end of each integration were used as the initial orbits for the next encounter . to minimize possible discontinuities at this transition we preserved the osculating values of angles @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are nodal longitudes of the two satellites with respect to the local laplace planes , and @xmath54 is saturn s nodal longitude with respect to the invariant plane of the outer solar system .",
    "angle @xmath55 remained unchanged because we maintained the orientation of orbits of titan and iapetus with respect to saturn s orbital plane .",
    "angle @xmath51 was preserved by applying a rotation on the position and velocity vectors of planets before each encounter .",
    "this procedure assured that the secular evolution of @xmath56 and @xmath57 did not suffer any artificial discontinuities during transitions from one encounter to another .",
    "we check on that and the discontinuities in @xmath57 were found to be @xmath58 , which should be insignificant .",
    "saturn s obliquity at the time of planetary encounters is unknown and we therefore treated it as an unknown parameter in our model . in each of the ten selected cases",
    ", we performed two sets of simulations with saturn s obliquity @xmath59 and @xmath31 . in the later case",
    ", it is assumed that saturn s obliquity was excited _ before _ the instability ( ward & hamilton 2004 , hamilton & ward 2004 ) . in the former case",
    ", it is assumed that saturn s equator was aligned with the orbital plane at the onset of the instability .",
    "this is plausible , because it has been suggested that saturn s current obliquity was excited by a secular spin - orbit resonance _",
    "after _ the instability ( bou et al . 2009 ) . it is also possible that saturn s obliquity had a value intermediate between these two extremes .",
    "we do not study these intermediate values here , because it turns out that satisfactory results can be obtained for both @xmath59 and @xmath31 ( section 4 ) .",
    "we therefore do not have a good motivation to investigate the intermediate values .    for each case and obliquity value",
    ", we performed 1000 integrations where the initial orbital phase of satellites and the initial azimuthal orientation of saturn s pole was chosen at random .",
    "these integrations should be considered statistically equivalent , because the orbital and precessional phases at the onset of instability are unknown .",
    "spin vector was assumed to be fixed in inertial space , which should be a reasonable approximation , because the stage of encounters typically lasts @xmath60 yr , while the precession period of saturn s spin axis is much longer ( @xmath61 yr at present ) . also , note that planetary encounters themselves can not significantly change the orientation of saturn s spin axis ( lee et al . 2007 ) .",
    "while the global orbital evolution of the planets was similar in the ten selected cases , the history of saturn s encounters with an ice giant varied from case to case .",
    "these differences are important for perturbations of iapetus s orbit and is why different cases were considered in the first place .",
    "the statistics of encounters is reported in table [ ten ] .",
    "there are between 14 ( case 6 ) and 64 ( case 10 ) recorded encounters in each case , a small fraction of which shows a minimal distance @xmath62 au ( column 5 in table [ ten ] ) .",
    "these very close encounters are obviously the most important for the regular satellites .",
    "the closest encounter of all occurred in case 6 ( @xmath63 au ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the closest encounter in case 1 had @xmath64  au . for reference ,",
    "the semimajor axes of titan and iapetus are 0.0081 au and 0.024  au , respectively .",
    "cases 2 , 6 and 10 had at least five encounters with @xmath62 au , while case 5 had one close encounter with @xmath65 au .",
    "these cases generated very large perturbations of orbits of iapetus and titan .",
    "in most trials , iapetus was ejected onto a heliocentric orbit . in those in which the orbit remained bound , the eccentricity and inclination ended up",
    "implausibly large .",
    "in addition , perturbations of titan s orbit often produced a very large inclination that , again , can not be reconciled with the present orbit ( because there is no obvious means to damp titan s inclination back down ; section 3 ) .",
    "we therefore believe that these cases are implausible .",
    "this is interesting because it shows that saturn s regular satellites pose important constraints on the instability calculations .",
    "deienno et al .",
    "( 2014 ) used cases 1 , 2 and 3 from nm12 discussed here and considered constraints from the galilean satellites of jupiter .",
    "they found case 2 implausible , because perturbations of the orbits of the galilean satellites were clearly excessive .",
    "this finding correlates with the constraints from the saturnian satellites considered here , which also allow us to rule out case 2 .",
    "table [ final ] shows the orbital elements of titan and iapetus after the last planetary encounter in cases 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 and 9 .",
    "the range of the results is broad , starting from relatively small perturbations such as those in case 7 , where iapetus inclinations ended up being @xmath66 on average .",
    "only @xmath3310% of trials in this case exceeded @xmath67 .",
    "we therefore find that dynamical perturbations in case 7 are not large enough to explain iapetus s present inclination .",
    "this would imply that iapetus would need to have a significant inclination before the stage of encounters .",
    "cases 1 , 3 , 4 , 8 and 9 appear to be more interesting .",
    "we now discuss these cases in detail . in general",
    ", the results show a dependence on the obliquity value of saturn . in case 1 ,",
    "for example , iapetus s orbit reached inclination @xmath68 deg for @xmath59 , while @xmath69 deg for @xmath31 .",
    "this trend of increasing @xmath57 with increasing @xmath70 is expected because of the following arguments . with @xmath59",
    "the main source of the inclination excitation is the direct torque of the ice giant on the satellite orbit .",
    "if @xmath70 is non - zero , however , the inclination with respect to the laplace surface can be changed by several additional effects .",
    "these additional effects are _ indirect _ in that they do not change the orientation of the satellite orbital plane in the inertial reference frame .",
    "instead , they affect the tilt of the laplace surface .",
    "a change of the semimajor axis of a satellite , for example , implies a change of @xmath28 according to eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) . if the semimajor axis immediately changed back during the next planetary encounter , the original orbital inclination would be recovered .",
    "if , instead , the next encounter happens only after a significant fraction of the nodal period , satellite s orbital plane has time to recess around the laplace surface , and the original inclination is not recovered .",
    "both these cases occur in reality as there are typically a few dozens of encounters spread over @xmath60 yr ( while @xmath71 yr ) .",
    "therefore , as the semimajor axis changes as a result of encounters , the inclination will random walk with respect to the laplace surface .",
    "this effect adds to that produced on the satellite orbit by the direct torque .",
    "additional changes of satellite s orbital inclination relative to the laplace surface are produced as _",
    "saturn s _ orbit is modified by scattering encounters with ice giants .",
    "they are a consequence of changes of saturn s orbital inclination and the dependence of @xmath28 on saturn s semimajor axis in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . for example , @xmath72 at 59 @xmath42 for saturn s initial semimajor axis @xmath73 au ( figure [ case8 ] ) , while @xmath74 with the present value @xmath75 au .",
    "figure [ case1 ] shows the final distribution of orbital elements of iapetus and titan obtained in case 1 and @xmath31 .",
    "this result is encouraging for several different reasons .",
    "first , the final @xmath76 in about 30% of all trials .",
    "the probability that iapetus obtained its present orbital inclination ( @xmath0 ) is therefore significant .",
    "second , titan s inclination to the laplace surface was excited to values between 0.1@xmath6 and 0.6@xmath6 , with the distribution peaking at @xmath77 .",
    "this is consistent with the present inclination of titan ( @xmath78 mean ) .",
    "third , the orbital eccentricity of iapetus remained low .",
    "there is thus no need in this case for invoking tides or other effects to bring the eccentricity down .",
    "figure [ example1 ] shows the orbital elements of satellites at the end of each encounter in one trial integration in case 1 .",
    "this trial was selected and is shown here because it leads to the final values of the orbital elements that are fully consistent with the present orbits of titan and iapetus .",
    "the semimajor axis values remained nearly unchanged , eccentricities remained small,0.03 of titan and iapetus were produced by a different process that can pre - date the time of the planetary instability . ] and inclinations reached the required values .",
    "many trial integrations in case 1 shows a similar result .",
    "the results in case 1 and @xmath59 are less ideal , because only @xmath3315% of trials lead to @xmath76 .",
    "this is a consequence of the general dependence of the results on saturn s obliquity discussed above .",
    "we conclude that a significant initial obliquity of saturn before the stage of planetary encounters helps to obtain better results in case 1 .",
    "very similar results were obtained in case 3 .",
    "we therefore do not explicitly discuss case 3 here .",
    "case 4 tells a different story . in this case",
    ", the closest encounter occurred at a distance @xmath79 au , which is only @xmath331.3 times the semimajor axis of iapetus .",
    "this encounter itself generated larger perturbation of satellite orbits than all encounters in cases 1 and 3 .",
    "iapetus s inclination ended up being @xmath80 deg for @xmath59 ( figure [ case4 ] ) and @xmath81 deg for @xmath31 .",
    "both these results match the present inclination of iapetus comfortably within 1@xmath82 .",
    "interestingly , titan s inclination was excited to @xmath83 deg for @xmath59 and to @xmath84 deg for @xmath31 .",
    "so , based solely on this result , low saturn s obliquity would be preferred in case 4 , because titan s inclination ends up matching it present value better with @xmath59 than when the obliquity is large .",
    "this is opposite to what we have found for cases 1 and 3 ( see above ) .",
    "in addition , unlike in cases 1 and 3 , the eccentricity of iapetus became significantly excited in case 4 ( to @xmath85 for @xmath59 and to @xmath86 for @xmath31 ) .",
    "this case would thus require significant eccentricity damping in times after the planetary instability ( section 4 ) .",
    "figure [ example2 ] illustrates the orbital elements of iapetus and titan in one trial integration in case 4 .",
    "cases 8 and 9 bear similarities to case 4 ( table [ final ] ) .",
    "both these cases generated the required excitation of iapetus s inclination , but led to significant eccentricity that would need to be damped after the epoch of planetary encounters .",
    "titan s inclination obtained in these simulations was roughly correct , perhaps only a bit larger than what we would ideally like ( column 5 in table [ final ] ) .",
    "titan s eccentricity remained essentially unchanged .",
    "these results should be seen in positive light .",
    "we were only able to consider ten instability cases thus far .",
    "our resolution of the initial conditions leading to the instability and planetary encounters is therefore grainy . given the sensitivity of these results to the detailed history of planetary encounters , we then find it quite possible that our tests are somewhat inadequate to get everything right .",
    "a more thorough investigation of parameter space will need a massive use of cpus or a different approach ( vokrouhlick et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "it is hypothesized that planetary instability occurred @xmath87 gyr ago ( e.g. , gomes et al . 2005 ) .",
    "here we studied several dynamical processes that may have altered iapetus s orbit during gigayears after the instability .",
    "we looked into several mechanisms : ( 1 ) dynamical effects of flybyes of 100-km class planetesimals , ( 2 ) dynamical friction from captured irregular satellites and their debris , and ( 3 ) tides .",
    "our tests showed that the effects of ( 1 ) are completely negligible .",
    "mechanism ( 2 ) would be effective in damping iapetus s eccentricity only if the mass captured in ( or evolved to ) the neighborhood of iapetus s orbit were @xmath88 , where @xmath89 kg . for comparison ,",
    "the mass of the original population of irregular satellites captured at saturn is estimated to be @xmath90 kg ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2014 ) , more than two orders of magnitude lower then needed .    to study ( 3 )",
    ", we adopted a model for tides developed in mignard ( 1979 , 1980 ) , where the tidal accelerations of satellites are given as functions of the planetocentric cartesian coordinates ( eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in lainey et  al .",
    "the tidal evolution of satellite s orbit was studied by direct numerical integrations of orbits with a symplectic @xmath91-body code known as swift_rmvs3 ( levison & duncan 1994 ) that we modified to include mignard s tidal acceleration terms .",
    "the satellite rotation was assumed to be synchronous . of",
    "that dissipated by satellite s librations ( e.g. , murray & dermott 1999 , chapter  4 ) . ]",
    "the dissipation effects were parametrized by the standard tidal parameter @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the quadrupole love number and @xmath94 is the quality factor ( assumed constant here ) . as for saturn ,",
    "previous theoretical work indicated the @xmath95 values at least of the order of @xmath96 ( e.g. , peale et al .",
    "1980 , zhang & nimmo 2009 ) , but lainey et al .",
    "( 2012 ) recently suggested from the astrometric modeling of cassini s observations that @xmath97 ( with about 30% uncertainty ) .",
    "we use this later value but point out that our main conclusions ( related to the eccentricity of iapetus ) are essentially independent of saturn s @xmath95 .",
    "instead , the strength of tidal damping of the eccentricity of iapetus sensitively depends , via the secular orbital coupling of iapetus to other moons , on the dissipation of tidal energy in titan and the inner satellites .",
    "we find that it is problematic to quantify this process , because @xmath95 values of saturn s satellites are poorly known .",
    "we therefore performed several numerical integrations with widely ranging values of @xmath95 .",
    "all satellites between mimas and iapetus were included .",
    "the principal result of these integrations is that the secular coupling of iapetus to titan and the inner moons , and the tidal dissipation in titan and the inner moons , would potentially be capable of reducing iapetus s eccentricity only if @xmath98 ( figure [ tides ] ) .",
    "this low value of @xmath95 , however , appears to be implausible .",
    "for example , dynamical constraints suggest that @xmath99-@xmath96 for enceladus and dione ( zhang & nimmo 2009 ) . for titan , theory indicates that the strength of tidal dissipation should sensitively depend on its interior structure ( e.g. , sohl et  al . 1995 ) , but is unlikely as low as needed here .",
    "measurements elsewhere in the solar system suggest @xmath100 for io ( lainey et al .",
    "2009 ) and @xmath101 for the moon ( khan et  al .",
    "2004 ) .    in summary",
    ", we find that if the orbital eccentricity of iapetus would have become excited during planetary encounters , it would probably stay high to the present epoch .",
    "this result has important implications for the interpretation of our scattering experiments ( section 3 ) , because it shows that only 3 out of 10 instability cases considered here ( numbers 1 , 3 and 7 in table 2 ) appear to be plausible based on iapetus s eccentricity constraint .",
    "we also find that titan s and iapetus s orbital inclinations , if excited by planetary encounters , would remain essentially unchanged during the subsequent tidal evolution .",
    "titan s inclination ( current mean @xmath102 ) does not appear to be a problem because it stays low during the scattering phase in all three cases mentioned above . while case 7 would require that iapetus s inclination was excited already before the scattering phase , cases 1 and 3 are capable of generating iapetus s inclination during the scaterring phase ( figure [ example1 ] ) .",
    "the orbital inclination of iapetus is a long standing problem in planetary science .",
    "the inclination should be @xmath1 if iapetus formed from a circumplanetary disk on the laplace surface , but it presently is @xmath0 .",
    "here we investigated the possibility that iapetus attained its significant orbital inclination during a hypothesized instability in the outer solar system when saturn had close encounters with an ice giant .",
    "we found that roughly 50% of instability cases that satisfy other constraints ( see nm12 ) are capable of exciting iapetus s ( and titans s ) inclination to the present value .",
    "for most of these cases to be plausible , however , some dissipation mechanism is required to damp the orbital eccentricity of iapetus that is typically excited by encounters to @xmath30.1 . in only 2 out of 10 instability cases studied here ,",
    "the eccentricity of iapetus remained low while the orbital inclination of iapetus was significantly excited ( such that @xmath76 in at least 30% of trials ; cases 1 and 3 ) .",
    "these different outcomes depend on the number and minimum distance of the encounters , and on their geometry .",
    "one of our main motivations for this study was the question of whether it is possible to have a history of encounters between saturn and an ice giant that leads to capture of the irregular satellites at saturn via the mechanism described in nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) _ and _ to satisfy constraints from saturn s regular satellites .",
    "here we demonstrated that it is indeed possible to satisfy these constraints simultaneously ( e.g. , in cases 1 and 3 ; see nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for irregular satellite capture in these cases ) .",
    "moreover , we found that the orbital perturbation of the regular satellites mainly results from a few closest encounters .",
    "the results are therefore expected to be highly variable . as a rough criterion",
    ", we find that the closest encounter of the ice giant to saturn can not be closer than 0.05 au or about 2 times the semimajor axis of iapetus ( or 0.02 au if the eccentricity constraint is relaxed ) .",
    "capture of irregular satellites , on the other hand , mainly depends on the bulk of distant encounters , and is expected to occur generically .",
    "the regular and irregular satellites thus represent somewhat different , and not mutually exclusive constraints .",
    "our final remark is related to the orbital perturbations of regular satellites at jupiter , uranus and neptune .",
    "deienno et al .",
    "( 2014 ) already demonstrated that the orbits of the galilean satellites remain unchanged in case 3 studied here , while they suffer implusibly large excitations in case 2 . also , according to deienno et al .",
    ", from the perspective of the galilean moons , the case 1 is intermediate between cases 2 and 3 . our tests for jupiter , using the same methodology",
    "as described for saturn in section 2 , confirm these results and show , in addition , that cases 4 , 7 , 8 , and 10 generate only modest ( and plausible ) perturbations of the galilean satellite orbits .",
    "therefore , while there is a hint of correlation of the results for jupiter and saturn , there are also cases such as the case 10 , where the galilean moons survive essentially undisturbed while saturn s regular satellites , including titan , plunge in disorder",
