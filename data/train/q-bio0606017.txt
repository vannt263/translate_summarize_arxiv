    "one of the most common tasks in microarray analysis is to identify a list of genes that are differentially expressed under two conditions , such as being affected by a disease vs. normal , before vs. after a medical treatment , and one vs. another disease subtype .",
    "the number of genes on the top - ranking list is usually much smaller than the total number of genes on the chip , @xmath2 .",
    "if the same type of microarray chip is used for two different studies ( e.g. disease - a vs. control , and disease - b vs. control ) , two differentially expressed gene lists can be obtained , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 genes .",
    "researchers often find the same genes appear in both lists and hypothesize that these common genes are involved the etiology of both diseases .",
    "however , for such a hypothesis to be convincing , one has to first estimate the probability for overlapping genes by chance alone . in other words ,",
    "if two lists of genes are selected out of @xmath2 genes randomly , we would like to calculate the probability for @xmath5 genes in common in the two lists , with the lengths of the two lists being @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this overlapping probability is known to follow the hypergeometric distribution .",
    "the name hypergeometric distribution was first used in @xcite , and was popularized by its role in fisher s exact test @xcite .    in microarray analysis ,",
    "overlapping probability and hypergeometric distribution mainly appear in testing the enrichment of genes in certain functional category @xcite . in this application ,",
    "the first list is the top - ranking differentially expressed genes , and a gene selection process is involved .",
    "the second list is nevertheless given : @xmath4 genes are known to be in a pathway , a member of a protein family , described by a gene ontology term , etc .",
    "one asks the question on chance probability for @xmath5 out of @xmath3 selected genes to be in a given pathway , a protein family , and describable by a gene ontology term .",
    "fixing @xmath4 or not is the main difference between their application and ours .    when a different gene selection criterion is used , the number of genes in the two top - ranking lists of two studies ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) will also change . because the stringency of a gene selection criterion is always adjustable and to some extent arbitrary",
    ", we would like to examine whether these changes will affect the overlapping probability . at two extreme situations , very small @xmath6 and very large @xmath7 ,",
    "it is clear that the number of overlapping genes is @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these @xmath5 values appear 100% of the times , so the corresponding @xmath0-value is equal to 1 , i.e. , not significant . for intermediate @xmath10 values , it is not clear what the overlapping probability and significance will be , and it is the topic of this abstract .",
    "given integers @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) ) , the hypergeometric distribution is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of possibilities of choosing @xmath5 objects out of @xmath2 objects : @xmath15 $ ] .    when @xmath3 genes are randomly chosen from the total of @xmath2 genes , and another random sampling leads to @xmath4 genes , the probability that the two lists of genes have @xmath5 in common is exactly the hypergeometric probability @xmath16 .",
    "this can be proven by the following steps : 1 ) the total number of possible choices for the two lists of genes is @xmath17 .",
    "2 ) there are @xmath18 possibilities for choosing the first list .",
    "3 ) among the @xmath3 genes in the first list , there are @xmath19 possibilities for choosing @xmath5 genes to be in common with the second list .",
    "4 ) in the second list , besides the @xmath5 genes that are in common with the first list , the remaining @xmath20 genes are chosen among the @xmath21  leftover \" genes not in the first list , thus @xmath22 possibilities . the @xmath16 is simply ( # 2 @xmath23 # 3 @xmath23 # 4 ) / # 1 . note",
    "that @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be switched without changing the @xmath16 value .",
    "it is usually more interesting to calculate the sum of @xmath16 for @xmath5 s equal or larger than the observed value ( i.e. , the @xmath0-value ) : @xmath24 in statistical package @xmath25 ( _ http://www.r-project.org/_ ) , there are at least two ways to calculate the overlapping @xmath0-value .",
    "the first is to use the accumulative distribution of hypergeometric distribution , _",
    "phyper(m , @xmath3 , @xmath21 , @xmath4 ) _ : @xmath0-value @xmath26 if @xmath27 , and @xmath0-value=1 if @xmath8 .",
    "the second method is to use the @xmath0-value from the fisher s exact test on the following 2-by-2 table : @xmath28 the two approaches lead to the identical result .    -90",
    "in hypergeometric distribution , the number of overlapping elements @xmath5 is an independent variable from the the list lengths @xmath29 . in order to get a rough idea on how @xmath5 changes with the list lengths , we use three real microarray datasets .",
    "theese studies concern three autoimmune diseases : rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , and psoriatic arthritis ( psa ) , described in details in @xcite .",
    "the number of controls ( c ) and patients ( p ) in these three datasets are ( c=39 , p=46 ) , ( c=41 , p=81 ) , and ( c=19 , p=19 ) , respectively .",
    "the total number of genes / probe - sets is @xmath3022283 , and the expression levels are log transformed .",
    "genes are ranked for their degree of differential expression which can be measured by various tests or models , such as @xmath1-test and logistic regression .    for any pair of studies , with a fixed number of top - ranking gene lists @xmath31",
    ", one can count the number of overlapping genes @xmath5 and the proportion @xmath32 .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] ( left column ) shows this proportion as a function of @xmath31 for three study - pairs ( ra - sle , sle - psa , ra - psa ) as well as for two ranking methods ( @xmath1-test and logistic regression ) .",
    "similar overlapping proportion of two random shuffled lists is also indicated in fig.[fig1 ] as crosses .    when @xmath31 is small , @xmath5 is more likely to be zero , so the proportion is also zero .",
    "when @xmath31 approaches the total number of genes , @xmath2 , all genes are overlapping genes , and the proportion is 1 . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] indeed shows these trends at the two extreme points . in order to check behavior in - between ,",
    "we draw a reference line in fig.[fig1 ] ( left column ) that assume a linear relationship between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "most of the points on fig.[fig1 ] are above this line , and the overlapping proportion of two random lists is exactly on this line .",
    "to have an idea of the absolute number of common genes more than expected by random chance , fig.[fig1 ] ( right column ) plots the observed @xmath5 subtract the expected @xmath35 as a function of @xmath31 . the maximum difference between the observed and expected",
    "is reached between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the difference of observed and expected @xmath5 s can be as much as 600800 .    -90",
    "the overlapping @xmath0-value corresponding to the @xmath5 counts plotted in fig.[fig1 ] was calculated by the hypergeometric distribution , and is shown in fig.[fig2 ] : @xmath38-axis is @xmath39-value ) , and @xmath40-axis is @xmath31 .",
    "six lines are shown for three comparisons ( ra - sle , sle - psa , ra - psa ) and two measurements of the differential expression ( @xmath1-test and logistic regression ) .",
    "zero @xmath0-values are converted to 2.2 @xmath41 which is the minimum value reported by @xmath25 program .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows that besides the two ends ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) where the @xmath0-value is 1 , the overlapping significance quickly increases with the length of top - ranking gene list @xmath44 ) , and can be extremely significant when a large number of genes are kept in the two lists for comparison .",
    "this result confirm our previous suspicion that overlapping significance is a function of the gene list lengths .",
    "if the selection of @xmath29 is arbitrary , the overlapping significance thus calculated is also arbitrary .",
    "it is not surprising that overlapping significance may keep increasing ( or , @xmath0-value decreasing ) with the increase of @xmath31 , because @xmath0-value in general depends on the sample size .",
    "when a signal is real ( true positive ) , @xmath0-value will monotonically decrease with the sample size . on the contrast , if a true signal is absent , the sample size does not affect the conclusion . as can be seen in fig.[fig2 ] , the overlapping significance for two random lists does not really change with @xmath31 .    one may argue that it is unlikely to consider top 5000 genes as being differentially expressed , because by a typical selection criterion ( e.g. @xmath0-value of @xmath1-test smaller than 0.01 , with or without multiple testing correction ) , the number of genes selected is less than a few hundreds . however , as can be seen in fig.[fig2 ] , even in the range of 10500 , the overlapping @xmath0-value changes dramatically .",
    "this pitfall of gene - list - length dependence of overlapping @xmath0-values has not been noticed before perhaps because in other application of hypergeometric distribution for calculating overlapping probability , the length of the second list @xmath4 is fixed , for example , in the study of overrepresentation of genes in certain pathway .",
    "the number of overlapping genes @xmath5 is then constrained from above by @xmath45 even though the length of the first list , @xmath3 , might increase by relaxing the gene selection criterion .    -90",
    "there are many genes / probe - sets on the microarray chip that do not register much signal .",
    "since these low - expressed genes are lowly expressed in both control and patient samples , they usually do not appear in the top - ranking differentially expressed gene list .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] shows @xmath39-value ) of each gene of 3 @xmath1-tests sorted by average expression ( log - transformed ) across all 245 samples in 3 datasets ( for both cases and controls ) .",
    "although we can not use the average expression level to predict the degree of differential expression , there is a general trend for low - expressed genes to rank lower in the differentially expressed list as seen from fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "we removed 7000 genes with lower overall expression across all samples , leaving @xmath46 genes .",
    "figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] are reproduced in fig.[fig4 ] for the dataset with a reduced gene pool . as in figs.[fig1 ] and",
    "[ fig2 ] , the observed number of overlapping genes @xmath5 is much larger than the expected , though the difference peaks at 400600 , as versus 600 - 800 in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the overlapping significance as measured by @xmath47-value ) again quickly moves up with @xmath31 as shown in the last column of fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the qualitative similarity between figs.[fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and fig.[fig4 ] indicates that the presence of low - expressed genes does not affect our conclusion .",
    "using the hypergeometric distribution to calculate the overlapping probability between two top - ranking differentially expressed genes in two studies , we have shown that the overlapping significance depends on the stringency of gene selection criterion , or equivalently , the length of the gene lists .",
    "this observation presents a problem when an overlapping @xmath0-value is reported but the gene selection criterion is not specified . on the other hand , the increase of the overlapping significance with the gene list length can be an indication that the significant overlapping of genes is a true signal .",
    "the overlapping probability calculated here assumes the two top - ranking gene lists are selected from the same pool of @xmath2 genes .",
    "if the two studies are based on different chip platforms , the two initial gene pools are not identical , though there are perhaps certain common genes .",
    "we plan to derive the overlapping distribution for this situation .",
    "we also plan to study the probability for genes appearing in three top - ranking gene lists .",
    "although a permutation based approach comparing multiple studies was proposed in @xcite , there is no analytic formula available .",
