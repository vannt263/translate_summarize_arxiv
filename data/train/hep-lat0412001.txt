    "it is well known that spectral flow of the massless dirac operator ( @xmath0 ) is related to the topology of the background gauge fields . when massless fermions are coupled to yang - mills fields with non - trivial topology ,",
    "one or more eigenvalues of the corresponding dirac operator necessarily vanish .",
    "this is formally given by the atiyah - singer index theorem @xcite @xmath1 where q is the topological charge of the gauge field and @xmath2(@xmath3 ) are the numbers of left(right ) zero eigenmodes of the dirac operator .",
    "on the other hand , until recently it was believed that staggered fermions do not feel gauge field topology @xcite because of the lack of zero eigenmode of the operator at finite lattice spacing .",
    "this unpleasant feature of staggered fermions was further revealed in comparisons of the infrared eigenvalue spectrum obtained in simulations with the predictions of random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum in all topological charge sectors was found to be consistent with the prediction of rmt for topological charge equal to zero @xcite .    in the past year",
    "this problem has been revisited and the situation has changed .",
    "recent calculations @xcite show that with staggered operator improvement for staggered fermions the correct response to qcd topology , governed by the index theorem , can be obtained . in @xcite",
    "we presented some of our results in a preliminary form . here",
    "we give our final results along with the study of some systematic effects not included in our earlier work .",
    "the failure of unimproved staggered fermion actions to show the proper topological features is due to lattice artifacts , in particular flavour - changing interactions .",
    "this was already suggested in ref .",
    "the staggered quark action describes four quark flavours in the continuum limit and the eigenvalue spectrum has a 4-fold degeneracy in this limit . at finite lattice spacing ,",
    "the flavour - changing interactions break the flavour symmetry and the degeneracy is lifted .",
    "consequently , staggered fermions do not have exact zero modes at finite lattice spacing because the continuum chiral modes ( if there are any ) are scattered on the lattice .",
    "one thus expects staggered fermions to show better topological properties if flavour - changing effects can be suppressed .",
    "in addition to lattice artifacts , the spectral density in the infrared limit also depends sensitively on the volume of the lattice .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that , because the topological susceptibility defined by @xmath4 is independent of the volume @xmath5 , the ensemble average @xmath6 scales approximately with @xmath5 .",
    "for example , previous studies @xcite on the spectral properties of the overlap operator have revealed this strong finite volume effect ( in contrast with the staggered dirac operator , the overlap fermion operator @xcite has exact chiral symmetry @xcite on the lattice and has true zero modes even at finite lattice spacing , see section [ sec_propover ] ) . in particular , it has been shown that satisfactory agreement with the predictions of rmt can be achieved only when the physical volume of the lattice exceeds @xmath7 . on smaller volumes",
    "the agreement is less appealing and the sensitivity to topology disappears .",
    "both of these issues have been examined in this project by studying the spectral flow in the infrared limit for a variety of improved staggered operators .",
    "the improved staggered operators are designed to suppress flavour - changing interactions by smoothing out the quark - gluon interaction vertex @xcite .",
    "four different sources of systematic effects have been considered :    * improvement in the staggered operator * improvement in the gauge field action * lattice spacing * lattice volume .    simulations are done both with the standard wilson gluon action and the @xmath8 accurate tadpole improved gluon action @xcite for a range of lattice spacings and volumes .",
    "it is observed that eigenmodes with small eigenvalues and large chirality appear as the level of improvement increases @xcite .",
    "these small eigenmodes can be identified as the chiral zero modes associated with the topology of the background gauge fields",
    ". our results also show the expected strong dependence on volume .",
    "only a few `` zero modes '' are observed when the physical volume is small and the number increases as the volume increases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the improved staggered operators and their properties will be reviewed in the next section .",
    "a similar review on the overlap operator is given in section [ sec_propover ] .",
    "details of the simulations are discussed in section [ sec_simulation ] and results will be presented in section [ sec_results ] . after successfully identifying the `` zero modes '' , distribution of the remaining non - chiral modes",

    "a variety of improvement schemes are considered here .",
    "the basic improved version is the @xmath11 tree - level improved asq operator @xcite , which includes an additional 3-link naik term and replaces the gauge field in ( [ unimpaction ] ) with fat7 effective links ( sum of the original link and the nearby paths , up to 7-link staples ) .",
    "tadpole improvement of the @xmath12 operator gives the @xmath8 accurate @xmath13 operator .",
    "this is the staggered fermion operator which has been used in recent dynamical fermion simulations @xcite .",
    "it has been found that there are alternate improvement schemes that can suppress flavour - symmetry breaking lattice artifacts even more than asq improvement .",
    "one such scheme is based on unitarized fat7 ( ufat7 ) links .",
    "the usefulness of ufat7 smearing was first discussed by lee @xcite and a staggered action which iterates this fattening procedure giving the improved asq operators @xmath14 was studied by follana _",
    "the hyp - improved operators @xmath15 @xcite are constructed from unitarized fat links also but only those links within the hypercubes containing the original link are included in the fattening process .",
    "readers are referred to the respective papers for further details .",
    "the staggered dirac operator is anti - hermitian and since @xmath16 where @xmath17 , the eigenvalues of @xmath18 are pure imaginary and come in pairs @xmath19 .",
    "the commutation relation @xmath16 is a remnant of the continuum global chiral symmetry on the lattice .",
    "in addition , it is well known that @xmath20 connects only even - even ( @xmath21 ) or odd - odd ( @xmath22 ) sites on the lattice .",
    "in this project , we choose to compute the eigenvalues of @xmath21 in favour of @xmath18 since it is hermitian and has real eigenvalues @xmath23 .",

    "it is useful to understand how the low - lying non - chiral modes scale with the various systematics .",
    "this explains the scales used in the spectral plots given later in section [ sec_results ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite , kalkreuter computed the complete spectrum of the unimproved staggered dirac operator on @xmath24 lattices at several lattice spacings .",
    "results show an accumulation of small eigenvalues with increasing lattice spacing .",
    "in addition , the number of eigenvalues increases when the volume of the lattice increases .",

    "when lattice spacing decreases , i.e. , one goes closer to the continuum limit , an increase in the magnitude of the low - lying non - chiral modes is expected . the same should happen as we come closer to the continuum by improving the action .",
    "these scaling properties will be reflected in the choice of axes for the spectral graphs .",

    "the following criteria are used for an eigenstate to be identified as a `` zero mode '' : i ) it is at least a factor of two smaller in eigenvalue than the smallest non - chiral mode and ii ) the chirality is at least five times larger than that of the smallest non - chiral mode .",
    "one can see also that as the level of improvement increases , the continuum fourfold degeneracy emerges where the scattered eigenmodes begin to form quartets .",

    "this large renormalization was also observed in previous studies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the `` zero modes '' can be identified without any difficulty in most of the cases for the @xmath50 and hyp operators .    to quantify the separation between the `` zero modes '' and the non - chiral modes , the distribution of the ratios of eigenvalues between the smallest non - chiral mode and the largest `` zero mode '' is plotted in fig .",

    "the identification of the topological charge index for a given gauge filed configuration is not unique .",
    "because of lattice artifacts and the different ways the staggered operator is improved , it can be expected that the topological charge indices obtained by using different operators do not always agree on a configuration by configuration basis .",
    "it is only when one is close to the continuum limit that the results agree . even with the overlap operator previous studies @xcite showed that the topological indices do not agree on a configuration by configuration basis when ,",
    "for example , a different mass parameter is used in the kernel . in the present case , we find that the topological charge indices determined by the different operators agree about 60 - 70% of the time , compared to 28% if the values were completely random .",

    "[ fig_unimpglue_b5.85_v10_qdist ] .",

    "as discussed in the introduction , we expect a strong dependence of the spectral density on the volume @xmath5 of the lattice and the topological charge average @xmath6 should scale with @xmath5 . in fig .",

    "results from previous sections showed that `` zero modes '' should be visibly separated from the non - chiral modes at this spacing for configurations generated by the improved gauge action .",
    "this is the case when the volume is @xmath62 .",
    "a similar volume effect has been seen with the overlap fermion operator also @xcite .",
    "a reasonable assumption is that this minimum volume effect is related to a property of the gauge field , perhaps some minimum volume is necessary before the topological structure is fully formed .",
    "as the lattice volume increases the number of eigenvalues increases and one may expect the gap between the zero modes and the non - chiral modes to scale as @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the net result is that there are more low - lying non - chiral modes as volume gets bigger . as fig .",
    "8 shows , a certain volume is necessary before the would - be `` zero modes '' show up and sensitivity to topology is established .    as the volume",
    "is increased even further the number of chiral `` zero modes '' increases roughly as @xmath64 as can be inferred from fig .",
