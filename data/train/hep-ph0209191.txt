    "rare @xmath8 decays involving flavour - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) transitions , such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , have received a lot of theoretical interest @xcite , especially after the first measurements reported by the cleo collaboration @xcite of the @xmath14 decay .",
    "the current world average based on the improved measurements by the cleo @xcite , aleph @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations , @xmath15 , is in good agreement with the estimates of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , which we shall take as @xmath16 , reflecting the parametric uncertainties dominated by the scheme - dependence of the quark masses .",
    "the decay @xmath14 also provides useful constraints on the parameters of the supersymmetric theories , which in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) have been recently updated in @xcite .",
    "exclusive decays involving the @xmath12 transition are best exemplified by the decay @xmath17 , which have been measured with a typical accuracy of @xmath18 , the current branching ratios being @xcite @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these decays have been analyzed recently @xcite , by taking into account @xmath2 corrections , henceforth referred to as the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) estimates , in the large - energy - effective - theory ( leet ) limit @xcite .",
    "as this framework does not predict the decay form factors , which have to be supplied from outside , consistency of nlo - leet estimates with current data constrains the magnetic moment form factor in @xmath17 in the range @xmath21 .",
    "these values are somewhat lower than the corresponding estimates in the lattice - qcd framework , yielding @xcite @xmath22 , and in the light cone qcd sum rule approach , which give typically @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "( earlier lattice - qcd results on @xmath17 form factors are reviewed in @xcite . )",
    "it is imperative to check the consistency of the nlo - leet estimates , as this would provide a crucial test of the ideas on qcd - factorization , formulated in the context of non - leptonic exclusive @xmath8-decays  @xcite , but which have also been invoked in the study of exclusive rare @xmath8-decays @xcite .",
    "the exclusive decays @xmath4 , @xmath24 have also been studied in the nlo - leet approach in @xcite . in this case , the leet symmetry brings an enormous simplicity , reducing the number of independent form factors from seven to only two , corresponding to the transverse and longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon in the underlying process @xmath25 , called hereafter @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the same symmetry reduces the number of independent form factors in the decays @xmath1 from four to two .",
    "moreover , in the @xmath28-range where the large energy limit holds , the two set of form factors are equal to each other , up to @xmath3-breaking corrections , which are already calculated in specific theoretical frameworks .",
    "thus , knowing @xmath29 precisely , one can make theoretically robust predictions for the rare @xmath8-decay @xmath4 from the measured @xmath30 decay in the sm .",
    "the leet symmetries are broken by qcd interactions and the leading @xmath2 corrections in perturbation theory are known @xcite .    in this talk we present the results of  @xcite , where a systematic analysis of the various independent helicity amplitudes in the decays @xmath4 and @xmath1 were performed in the nlo accuracy in the large energy limit .",
    "we recall that a decomposition of the final state @xmath31 in terms of the helicity amplitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 , without the explicit @xmath2 corrections , was undertaken in a number of papers @xcite . combining the analysis of the decay modes @xmath4 and @xmath1 ,",
    "we show that the ratios of differential decay rates involving definite helicity states , @xmath10 and @xmath34 , can be used for testing the sm precisely .",
    "at the quark level , the rare semileptonic decay @xmath35 can be described in terms of the effective hamiltonian @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the ckm matrix elements @xcite and @xmath38 is the fermi coupling constant . following the notation and the convention used in ref .",

    "<S> we calculate the independent helicity amplitudes in the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the so - called large - energy - effective - theory ( leet ) . taking into account the dominant @xmath2 and @xmath3 symmetry - breaking effects , we calculate various single ( and total ) distributions in these decays making use of the presently available data and decay form factors calculated in the qcd sum rule approach . </S>",
    "<S> differential decay rates in the dilepton invariant mass and the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath4 are worked out . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the ratios @xmath5 , involving the helicity amplitudes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , as precision tests of the standard model in semileptonic rare @xmath8-decays are emphasized . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be used to determine the ckm ratio @xmath11 and search for new physics , where the later is illustrated by supersymmetry . </S>"
