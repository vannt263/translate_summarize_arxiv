    "savannas ecosystems are characterized by the long - term coexistence between a continuous grass layer and scattered or clustered trees @xcite .",
    "occurring in many regions of the world , in areas with very different climatic and ecological conditions , the spatial structure , persistence , and resilience of savannas have long intrigued ecologists @xcite . however , despite substantial research , the origin and nature of savannas have not yet been fully resolved and much remains to be learned .",
    "savanna tree populations often exhibit pronounced , non - random spatial structures @xcite .",
    "much research has therefore focused on explaining how spatial patterning in savannas arises @xcite . in most natural plant systems",
    "both facilitative and competitive processes are simultaneously present @xcite and hard to disentangle @xcite .",
    "some savanna studies have pointed toward the existence of short - distance facilitation @xcite , while others have demonstrated evidence of competition @xcite , with conflicting reports sometimes arriving from the same regions .",
    "different classes of savannas , which can be characterized by how much rainfall they typically receive , should be affected by different sets of processes .",
    "for example , in semiarid savannas water is extremely limited ( low mean annual precipitation ) and competition among trees is expected to be strong , but fire plays little role because there is typically not enough grass biomass to serve as fuel .",
    "in contrast , humid savannas should be characterized by weaker competition among trees , but also by frequent and intense fires . in - between these extremes , in mesic savannas , trees likely have to contend with intermediate levels of both competition for water and fire @xcite .",
    "competition among trees is mediated by roots that typically extend well beyond the crown @xcite .",
    "additionally , fire can lead to local facilitation due to a protection effect , whereby vulnerable juvenile trees placed near adults are protected from fire by them @xcite .",
    "we are particularly interested in how the interplay between these mechanisms governs the spatial arrangement of trees in mesic savannas , where both mechanisms may operate . on the other side ,",
    "it has frequently been claimed that pattern formation in arid systems can be explained by a combination of long - distance competition and short - distance facilitation @xcite .",
    "this combination of mechanisms is also known to produce spatial structures in many other natural systems @xcite .",
    "although mesic savannas do not display the same range of highly regular spatial patterns that arise in arid systems ( e.g. , tigerbush ) , similar mechanisms might be at work .",
    "specifically , the interaction between long - range competition and short - range facilitation might still play a role in pattern formation in savanna tree populations , but only for a limited range of parameter values and possibly modified by demographic stochasticity .",
    "although the facilitation component has often been thought to be a key component in previous vegetation models @xcite , rietkerk and van de koppel @xcite , speculated , but did not show , that pattern formation could occur without short - range facilitation in the particular example of tidal freshwater marsh . in the case of savannas ,",
    "as stated before , the presence of adult trees favor the establishment of new trees in the area , protecting the juveniles against fires . considering this effect , we take the facilitation component to its infinitesimally short spatial limit , and study its effect in the emergence of spatially periodic structures of trees . to our knowledge , this explanation , and the interrelation between long - range competition and local facilitation , has not been explored for a vegetation system",
    ". one of our main results is that when considering the limit of local facilitation and nonlocal competition , clustering of trees appears .",
    "here we develop a minimalistic model of savannas that considers two of the factors , as already mentioned , thought to be crucial to structure mesic savannas : tree - tree competition and fire , with a primary focus on spatially nonlocal competition .",
    "employing standard tools used in the study of pattern formation phenomena in physics ( stability analysis and the structure function ) @xcite , we explore the conditions under which the model can produce non - homogeneous spatial distributions .",
    "a key strength of our approach is that we are able to provide a complete and rigorous analysis of the patterns the model is capable of producing , and we identify which among these correspond to situations that are relevant for mesic savannas .",
    "we further examine the role of demographic stochasticity in modifying both spatial patterns and the conditions under which trees persist in the system in the presence of fire , and discuss the implications of these results for the debate on whether the balance of processes affecting savanna trees is positive , negative , or is variable among systems .",
    "this is the framework of our study : the role of long - range competition , facilitation and demographic fluctuations ( in the second part of the paper ) in the spatial structures of mesic savannas . to complete our work",
    "we include an appendix where we study the effect of external fluctuations ( mimicking for e.g. rainfall ) on savanna dynamics .",
    "our model is inspired by the one presented by calabrese et al . in @xcite .",
    "it complements theirs by providing further analytical results that clearly demonstrate that this simple system , where we focus on the local limit of facilitation , can produce the full spectrum of spatial patterns reported from models employing both short - range facilitation and long - range inhibition ( competition ) .",
    "in this section we derive the deterministic equation for the local density of trees , such that dynamics is of the logistic type and we only consider tree - tree competition and fire .",
    "we study the formation of patterns via stability analysis and provide numerical simulations of our model , showing the emergence of spatial structures .",
    "calabrese et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a simple discrete - particle lattice savanna model that considers the birth - death dynamics of trees , and where tree - tree competition and fire are the principal ingredients .",
    "these mechanisms act on the probability of establishment of a tree once a seed lands at a particular point on the lattice . in the discrete model ,",
    "seeds land in the neighborhood of a parent tree with a rate @xmath0 , and establish as adult trees if they are able to survive both competition neighboring trees and fire .",
    "as these two phenomena are independent , the probability of establishment is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the probability of surviving the competition , and @xmath3 is the probability of surviving a fire event . from this dynamics",
    ", we write a deterministic differential equation describing the time evolution of the global density of trees ( mean field ) , @xmath4 , where the population has logistic growth at rate @xmath0 , and an exponential death term at rate @xmath5 .",
    "it reads : @xmath6    generalizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : mf ] ) , we propose an evolution equation for the space - dependent ( local ) density of trees , @xmath7 : @xmath8 we allow the probability of overcoming competition to depend on tree crowding in a local neighborhood , decaying exponentially with the density of surrounding trees as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a parameter that modulates the strength of the competition , and @xmath11 is a positive kernel function that introduces a finite range of influence .",
    "this model is related to earlier models of pattern formation in arid systems @xcite , and subsequent works @xcite , but it differs from standard kernel - based models in that the kernel function accounts for the interaction neighborhood , and not for the type of interaction with the distance . note also that the nonlocal term enters nonlinearly in the equation .",
    "following @xcite , @xmath12 is assumed to be a saturating function of grass biomass , @xmath13 , similar to the implementation of fire of jeltsch _ et al . _ in @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 governs the resistance to fire , so @xmath16 means no resistance to fires .",
    "notice how our model is close to the one in @xcite through the definitions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , although we consider the probability of surviving a fire depending on the local density of trees , and in @xcite it depends on the global density .",
    "the deterministic differential equation that considers tree - tree competition and fire for the spatial tree density is @xmath17 where @xmath18    thus , we have a logistic - type equation with an effective growth rate that depends nonlocally on the density itself , and which is a combination of long - range competition and local facilitation mechanisms ( fire ) .",
    "the probability of surviving a fire is higher when the local density of trees is higher , as can be seen from the definition in equation ( [ probfire ] ) .    in figure [ transition ]",
    "we show numerical solutions for the mean field equation ( [ eq : mf ] ) ( lines ) and the spatially explicit model ( equation [ sav1 ] ) ( dots ) in the stationary state @xmath19 using different values of the competition . we have used a top - hat function as the competition kernel , @xmath11 ( see section [ lsa ] for more details on the kernel choice ) .",
    "we observe a very good agreement of both descriptions which becomes worse when we get closer to the critical point @xmath20 , where the model presents a phase transition from a tree - grass coexistence to a grassland state .",
    "this disagreement appears because while the mean field equation describes an infinite system , the eq .",
    "( [ sav1 ] ) description forces us to choose a size for the system .",
    "the model reproduces the long - term coexistence between grass and trees that is characteristic of savannas . to explore this coexistence , we study the long - time behavior of the system and analyze the homogeneous stationary solutions of eq .",
    "( [ sav1 ] ) , which has two fixed points .",
    "the first one is the absorbing state representing the absence of trees , @xmath21 , and the other can be obtained , in the general case , by numerically solving @xmath22 in the regime where @xmath23 is small ( near the critical point ) , if competition intensity , @xmath10 , is also small , it is possible to obtain an analytical expression for the critical value of the probability of surviving a fire , @xmath20 , @xmath24 outside of the limit where @xmath25 , we can solve eq .",
    "( [ steq ] ) numerically in @xmath23 to show that the critical value of the fire resistance parameter , @xmath20 , does not depend on competition .",
    "a steady state with trees is stable for higher fire survival probability ( fig .",
    "[ transition ] ) .",
    "the model , then , shows a transition from a state where grass is the only form of vegetation to another state where trees and grass coexist at @xmath20 . in what follows ,",
    "we fix @xmath26 , so we choose our temporal scale in such a way that time is measured in units of @xmath5",
    ". this choice does not qualitatively affect our results .",

    "the stability analysis is performed by considering small harmonic perturbations around @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",

    "therefore , it determines the length scale of the spatial pattern .",
    "these two equations yield the values of the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath15 at which the maximum of the curve @xmath41 , right at @xmath39 , starts becoming positive .",
    "this signals the formation of patterns in the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ sav1 ] ) . as eq .",
    "( [ eq : sec ] ) is explicitly written as @xmath42 the most unstable wavenumber @xmath39 can be obtained by evaluating the zeros of the derivative of the fourier transform of the kernel .",
    "equation  ( [ reldisper ] ) shows that competition , through the kernel function , fully determines the formation of patterns in the system .",
    "the local facilitation appears in @xmath43 and it is not relevant in the formation of spatial structures .",
    "if the fourier transform of @xmath44 never takes positive values , then @xmath45 is always negative and only the homogeneous solution is stable . however , when @xmath46 can take negative solutions then patterns may appear in the system .",
    "what does this mean in biological terms ?",
    "imagine that we have a family of kernels described by a parameter @xmath47 : @xmath48 ( @xmath49 gives the range of competition ) .",
    "the kernels are more peaked around @xmath50 for @xmath51 and more box - like when @xmath52 .",
    "it turns out that this family of functions has non - negative fourier transform for @xmath53 , so that no patterns appear in this case .",
    "a lengthy discussion of this property in the context of competition of species can be found in @xcite .",
    "thus , the shape of the competition kernel dictates whether or not patterns will appear in the system .",
    "if pattern formation is possible , then the values of the fire and competition parameters govern the type of solution ( see below ) .",
    "our central result for nonlocal competition is that , contrary to conventional wisdom , it can , in the limit of infinitesimally short ( purely local ) facilitation , promote the clustering of trees . whether or not this occurs depends entirely on the shape of the competition kernel . for large @xmath47",
    "we have a box - like shape , and in these cases trees compete strongly with other trees , roughly within a distance @xmath49 from their position .",
    "the mechanism behind this counterintuitive result is that trees farther than @xmath49 away from a resident tree area are not able to _ invade _ the zone defined by the radius r around the established tree ( their seeds do not establish there ) , so that an exclusion zone develops around it . for smaller @xmath47",
    "there is less competition and the exclusion zones disappear .    for a more detailed analysis",
    ", one must choose an explicit form for the kernel function .",
    "our choice is determined by the original @xmath54 taken in @xcite , so that it decays exponentially with the number of trees in a neighborhood of radius @xmath49 around a given tree .",
    "thus , for @xmath44 we take the step function ( limit @xmath55 ) @xmath56 as noticed before , the idea behind the nonlocal competition is to capture the effect of the long roots of a tree .",
    "the kernel function defines the area of influence of the roots , and it can be modeled at first order with the constant function of equation ( [ kerneldd ] ) .",
    "thus the parameter r , which fixes the _ nonlocal _ interaction scale , must be of the order of the length of the roots @xcite .",
    "since the roots are the responsible for the adsorption of resources ( water and soil nutrients ) , a strong long - range competition term implies strong resource depletion . for this kernel",
    "the fourier transform is @xcite @xmath57 and its derivative is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the @xmath61-order bessel function . since @xmath34 can take positive and negative values , pattern solutions may arise in the system , that will in turn depend on the values of @xmath10 and @xmath15 .",
    "the most unstable mode is numerically obtained as the first zero of @xmath62 , eq .",
    "( [ derlam ] ) , which means the first zero of the bessel function @xmath63 .",
    "this value only depends on @xmath49 , being independent of the resistance to fires and competition , and it is @xmath64 . because a pattern of @xmath65 cells is characterized by a wavenumber @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the system size , the typical distance between clusters , @xmath68 , using the definition of the critical wavenumber is given by @xmath69 .",
    "in other words , it is approximately the range of interaction @xmath49 .",
    "this result is also independent of the other parameters of the system .",
    "since we are interested in the effect of competition and fire on the distribution of savanna trees , we will try to fix all the parameters but @xmath15 and @xmath10 .",
    "we will explore the effect of different values of these parameters on the results .",
    "first , we have chosen ( as in @xcite ) the death rate @xmath26 , and solving eq .",
    "( [ steq ] ) we will roughly estimate the birth rate , @xmath0 .",
    "we will work in the limit of intermediate to high mean annual precipitation , so water is non - limiting and thus we can neglect the effects of competition ( @xmath70 ) . at this intermediate to high mean annual precipitation",
    "the empirically observed upper limit of savanna tree cover is approximately @xmath71 @xcite . to reach this upper limit in the tree cover ,",
    "disturbances must also be absent , implying no fire ( @xmath72 ) . in this limit ,",
    "the mean field equation ( [ eq : mf ] ) is quantitatively accurate , as it is shown in figure [ transition ] , and the stationary mean field solution of the model depends only on the birth rate @xmath73 it can be solved for @xmath0 for a fixed @xmath71 , and it yields @xmath28 @xcite . in the following we just consider the dependence of our results on @xmath10 and @xmath15 .",

    "the previous analysis provides information , depending on the competition and fire parameters , about when the solution is spatially homogenous and when trees arrange in clusters .",

    "similarly to what has been observed in studies of semiarid water limited systems @xcite , different structures , including gaps , stripes , and tree spots , are obtained in the stationary state as we increase the strength of competition for a fixed value of the fire parameter or , on the other hand , as we decrease the resistance to fires for a given competition intensity . in both equivalent cases",
    ", we observe this spectrum of patterns as far as we go to a more dry state of the system , where resources ( mainly water ) are more limited ( see figs .  [ patterns](a)-[patterns](c ) ) and competition is consequently stronger .",
    "this same sequence of appearance of patterns has been already observed in the presence of different short - range facilitation mechanisms @xcite .",

    "the main difference is that the facilitation provided by the protection effect of adult trees against fires in our savanna model takes the short - range facilitation to its infinitesimally short limit ( i.e , local limit ) . under this assumption",
    "we have studied the conditions under which our model could account for patterns .",
    "we have shown that nonlocal competition combined with local facilitation induces the full range of observed spatial patterns , provided the competition term enters nonlinearly in the equation for the density of trees , and that competition is strong enough .",
    "the key technical requirement for this effect to occur is that the competition kernel must be an almost constant function in a given competition region , and decay abruptly out of the region .",
    "we verify this condition working with supergaussian kernel functions . in practice",
    ", this means that competition kernels whose fourier transform takes negative values for some wavenumber values , will lead to competition driven clustering .",
    "the other mechanism we have considered for a minimalistic but realistic savanna model , fire , has been shown to be relevant for the coexistence of trees and grass and for the shape of the patterns . however , competition is the main ingredient allowing pattern solutions to exist in the model .",
    "if the shape of the kernel allows these types of solutions , then the specific values of fire and competition parameters determine the kind of spatial structure that develops .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that one can observe the full spectrum of patterns in the limit where fires vanish ( @xmath72 ) , so there is no facilitation at all , provided competition is strong enough .",
    "however , when there is no competition , @xmath70 , no patterns develop regardless of the value of the fire term .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the nonlocal competition term is responsible for the emergence of clustered distributions of trees in the model , with the fire term playing a relevant role only to fix the value of the competition parameter at which patterns appear . in other words , for a given competition strength , patterns appear more readily when fire is combined with competition . a similar mechanism of competitive interactions between species has been shown to give rise to clusters of species in the context of classical ecological niche theory .",
    "scheffer and van nes @xcite showed that species distribution in niche space was clustered , and pigolotti et al .",
    "@xcite showed that this arises as an instability of the nonlocal nonlinear equation describing the competition of species .",
    "long - distance competition for resources in combination with the local facilitation due to the protection effect of adult trees in the establishment of juvenile ones can explain the emergence of realistic structures of trees in mesic savannas .",
    "in these environmental conditions , competition is limited , so we should restrict to small to intermediate values of the parameter @xmath10 , and the effect of fires is also worth to be taken into account . however , these two ingredients give a full range of patterns observed in vegetated systems , but not in the particular case of savannas .",
    "it is necessary to consider the role of demographic noise , which is present in the system through the stochastic nature of the birth and death processes of individual trees . in this complete framework",
    "our model shows irregular patterns of trees similar to the observed in real savannas .",
    "the other important feature of savannas , the characteristic long - time coexistence of trees and grass is well captured with our model ( figures [ transition ] and [ noisy - transition ] ) .",
    "besides , the presence of demographic noise , as it is shown in figure [ noisy - transition ] , makes our approach much more realistic , since the persistence of trees in the face of fires is related to the water in the system . on the other hand ,",
    "demographic stochasticity causes tree extinction at lower fire frequencies ( larger @xmath15 ) than in the deterministic case .",
    "this is because random fluctuations in tree density are of sufficient magnitude that this can hit zero even if the deterministic stationary tree density ( for a given fire frequency ) is greater than zero .",
    "this effect vanishes if we increase the system size .",
    "the demographic noise is proportional to the density of trees ( proportional to @xmath111 ) , so fluctuations are smaller if we study bigger patches of savannas . as usually happens in the study of critical phenomena in statistical mechanics , the extinction times due to demographic noise increase exponentially with the size of the system for those intensities of competition and fire that allow the presence of trees in the stationary state . over the critical line ,",
    "this time will follow a power law scaling , and a logarithmic one when the stationary state of the deterministic model is already absorbing ( without trees ) @xcite .",
    "we have shown the formation of patterns in a minimal savanna model , that considers the combination of long - range competition and local facilitation mechanisms as well as the transition from trees - grass coexistence to a grass only state .",
    "the salient feature of the model is that it only considers nonlocal ( and nonlinear ) competition through a kernel function which defines the length of the interaction , while the facilitation is considered to have an infinitesimally short influence range .",
    "our model thus differs from standard kernel - based savanna models that feature both short - range facilitation and long - range competition .",
    "the same sequence of spatial patterns appears in both approaches , confirming rietkerk and van de koppel s @xcite suggestion that short - range facilitation does not induce spatial pattern formation by itself , and long - distance competition is also needed .",
    "it also suggests that long - range competition could be not only a necessary , but also a sufficient condition to the appearance of spatial structures of trees .    inspired by @xcite",
    ", we have proposed a nonlocal deterministic macroscopic equation for the evolution of the local density of trees where fire and tree - tree competition are the dominant mechanisms .",
    "if the kernel function falls off with distance very quickly ( the fourier transform is always positive ) the system only has homogenous solutions . in the opposite case",
    ", patterns may appear depending on the value of the parameters ( @xmath10 and @xmath15 ) , and in a sequence similar to the spatial structures appearing in standard kernel - based models . under less favorable environmental conditions ,",
    "trees tend to arrange in more robust structures to survive ( fig .",
    "[ patterns](d ) ) .",
    "biologically , trees are lumped in dense groups , separated by empty regions .",
    "entrance of new trees in these _ exclusion zones _ is impossible due to the intense competition they experience there .",
    "a great strength of our approach is that our deterministic analysis is formal , and we have shown the different spatial distributions of the trees that occur as competition becomes more intense , concluding that self organization of trees is a good mechanism to promote tree survival under adverse conditions @xcite .",
    "trees tend to cluster in the high competition ( low resources ) limit ( fig .",
    "[ patterns](d ) ) , due to the formation of exclusion zones caused by non - local competition , and not as a result of facilitation . however , because we are dealing with a deterministic model , the patterns are too regular and the transition between the grass - only and a tree - populated states is independent of tree competition .",
    "we therefore considered stochasticity coming from the stochastic nature of individual birth and death events , to provide a more realistic description of savanna dynamics .",
    "calabrese et al .",
    "@xcite also noted that savanna - to - grassland transition was independent of competition intensity in the mean field approach , but not when demographic noise was included . in the present model , both the grassland to savanna transition and",
    "the spatial structures that develop are influenced by demographic stochasticity . in the case of spatial structures ,",
    "demographic noise is specially relevant , since it turns much of the unrealistic patterns of the deterministic model into more realistic ones , that remind the observed in real savannas .",
    "it also allows the existence of periodic arrangements of trees in more humid systems , which means environmental conditions closer to mesic savannas .",
    "we have quantified the characteristic spacing of spatial patterns through the structure function .",
    "the irregular patterns produced by the stochastic model still have a dominant wavelength whose value is the same as in the deterministic model and depends only on the value of the range of the interaction , @xmath49 , in the kernel function .",
    "the match between the typical spatial scale of the patterns and the characteristic distance over which nonlocal competition acts indicates that competition is responsible for the presence of clustered spatial structures .",
