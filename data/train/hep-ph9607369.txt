    "as it is well known , the most popular theoretical description of the symmetry breaking sector ( sbs ) of the standard model ( sm ) , is given by the minimal standard model ( msm ) which is nothing but an @xmath4 gauged linear sigma model .",
    "indeed , the hidden sector displays an @xmath5 _ global _ symmetry which is spontaneously broken down to @xmath6 .",
    "this mechanism is responsible for the the spontaneous breaking of the _ gauge _ symmetries of the complete model . in this scheme",
    "we have three would - be goldstone bosons , which will give masses to the @xmath7 and @xmath8 through the higgs mechanism .",
    "they parametrize the space spanned by the three broken generators , i.e. the coset @xmath9 there is however a particle which survives the higgs mechanism , which is known as the higgs boson .",
    "this particle is the only missing piece of the msm and for this reason it is very important to be able to predict its behaviour in order to confirm or reject the msm experimentally .    at tree level",
    "the dynamics of the higgs sector is controlled by its self - coupling @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , its mass is related with this constant by the simple equation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 gev is the vacuum expectation value .",
    "notice that this equation suggests that a heavy higgs will give rise to a strongly interacting higgs sector ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that for large @xmath10 the above equation does not hold any more , since perturbation theory is not reliable . as a matter of fact",
    ", the tree level amplitudes break unitarity for higgs masses around @xmath13 tev @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems clear that a more complex dynamics should emerge for large coupling .",
    "at the same time , there are strong hints supporting the triviality of the minimal higgs sector ( see @xcite for a review ) , which means that it should be considered as some kind of effective theory which can be applied only for energies well below some cutoff @xmath14 .",
    "in such case , the higgs mass becomes a decreasing function of this cutoff in such a way that , at some point around 1 tev , one has @xmath15 .",
    "this fact is usually interpreted as an upper bound for the higgs mass , since it should not be larger than the cutoff @xmath14 of the effective theory .    from the practical point of view",
    "the natural place to probe this dynamics is gauge boson scattering . as it is well known , the longitudinal components of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 gauge bosons are related with the three would - be goldstone bosons .",
    "the precise relation is given by the equivalence theorem ( et ) @xcite , which states that at high energies the @xmath16-matrix elements of longitudinal gauge bosons are the same as those of their corresponding gb . this theorem is very useful since it is far easier to work with the would - be goldstone bosons than with gauge bosons .",
    "the et has been widely used in many studies concerning the discovery of the higgs boson at the future large hadron collider ( lhc ) ( see @xcite and references therein ) . with its help and at _ lowest order _ in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath4 gauge couplings , it is possible to reduce the study of longitudinally polarized gauge boson dynamics to the _ non - gauged _",
    "@xmath19 linear sigma model .",
    "nevertheless , the tree level , or even the one - loop approximation @xcite , does not provide a complete description of the expected behaviour of the physical higgs @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the strong interacting regime , i.e. for large @xmath10 , the standard perturbation theory does not work . in particular",
    "it is not able to reproduce properly the position and the width of a heavy higgs .",
    "for this reason some non - perturbative techniques have been studied in the literature like the @xmath20 method ( see @xcite and @xcite ) or the pad approximants @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to those listed above is the so called large @xmath0 limit @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to extend the @xmath19 symmetry breaking pattern of the linear sigma model to @xmath21 .",
    "once this is done , the amplitudes are obtained to lowest order in the @xmath22 parameter @xcite .",
    "the relevant point is that in this simple manner it is possible to study some properties of the higgs dynamics , which are expected theoretically , but that can not be reproduced with more conventional techniques .",
    "in particular , the would - be goldstone boson elastic scattering amplitudes are unitary ( up to @xmath23 corrections ) and satisfy the weinberg low - energy theorems coming from the @xmath24 symmetry @xcite .",
    "moreover , the higgs propagator has a pole in the second riemann sheet that has to be understood as the physical higgs .",
    "the position of this pole is a function of the renormalized higgs mass @xmath25 but its real part is never bigger than some value around 1.5 tev , even in the @xmath26 limit .",
    "the fact that there is a saturation value for the higgs mass is consistent with the assumed triviality of the @xmath19 model and has also been found in other non - perturbative approaches like the above mentioned @xmath20 method or the pad approximants .    in this work",
    "we have applied the large @xmath0 techniques to an @xmath21 linear sigma model which has been gauged with the @xmath27 symmetry of the sm .",
    "the aim of this generalization is twofold . first it will be possible to compute the elastic gauge boson scattering amplitudes _ without _ using the et",
    "this is very important since then we can apply our results at low energies too .",
    "nevertheless we show how the et works remarkably well in the large @xmath0 approach , which is also a nice check of our computations at high energies .",
    "second , by gauging the linear sigma model , we are able to to include systematically the @xmath17 and @xmath18 corrections keeping at the same time the very good properties of the standard large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we will show that this approach is very easy to implement and for this reason it is appropriate to describe the higgs phenomenology at the lhc .",
    "the plan of the paper goes as follows . in section two",
    "we introduce the @xmath28 gauged @xmath21 linear sigma model . in section three",
    "we study the main properties of the physical higgs boson in this approximation . in the fourth",
    "we check our method with the equivalence theorem and how it is satisfied in the large @xmath0 limit . in the fifth",
    "we show our numerical results , which are relevant for the lhc phenomenology . finally in section six we give the main conclusions of our work .",
    "we start from the @xmath27 gauged version of the linear sigma model @xmath29 generalized to the coset @xmath21 .",
    "the classical lagrangian is then given by @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "as usual , @xmath33 is the standard @xmath34 yang - mills term and the covariant derivatives are defined as @xmath35 where the @xmath36 and the @xmath37 generators are @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 where all the non written entries vanish .",
    "the potential is given by @xmath41 whose tree level minimum is reached whenever @xmath42 . as a consequence",
    "once we choose a vacuum to quantize the theory , the original @xmath43 symmetry will be broken down to @xmath24 . with the standard choice @xmath44 and defining the higgs field as @xmath45",
    ", we can write @xmath46 where the tree level higgs mass is given by @xmath47 .    in order to obtain a well defined perturbation theory",
    ", one has to add a gauge fixing and a faddeev - popov term to the lagrangian in eq.[lagra ] . as far as we are dealing with a gauge theory which is spontaneously broken , it is specially useful to choose an @xmath48 gauge , where now @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be directly identified with the would - be goldstone bosons . with the complete lagrangian at hand it is possible to derive the feynman rules following the usual procedures . for convenience ,",
    "we will be working all the time in the landau gauge , which simplifies the calculations since the ghosts do not couple directly to the @xmath51 fields and their propagator does not have a mass term .",
    "in order to study the main properties of the higgs resonance in the large @xmath0 limit of the model defined above , we will start by setting @xmath52 , i.e. we will turn off the gauge interactions .",
    "thus the only fields we have to consider are the @xmath0 goldstone bosons @xmath51 and the higgs @xmath53 .",
    "thanks to the remaining @xmath24 symmetry as well as to crossing symmetry , the scattering amplitude for the process @xmath54 can be written as @xmath55    ( 20000,20000 )    ( 7500,20000)[6000 ] by 150 ( , ) by -150 ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) [ 3000 ]    ( 4000,)a )    ( 6700,20000)@xmath56 ( 6700,15000)@xmath56 ( 12300,20000)@xmath56 ( 12300,15000)@xmath56    by 5000 by -500    ( , ) @xmath57 by 500    by 5000    ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) [ 3000 ]    ( 16700,20000)@xmath56 ( 16700,15000)@xmath56 ( 22300,20000)@xmath56 ( 22300,15000)@xmath56    by 5000 by -500 ( , ) @xmath58 by 500 by 5000    ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) [ 3 ] ( , 18300)@xmath53 ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) [ 3000 ]    ( 26700,20000)@xmath56 ( 26700,15000)@xmath56 ( 38000,20000)@xmath56 ( 38000,15000)@xmath56    ( 7500,13000)[6000 ] by 150 ( , ) by -150 ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) [ 3000 ]    ( 4000,)b )    ( 6700,13000)@xmath56 ( 6700,8000)@xmath56 ( 12300,13000)@xmath56 ( 12300,8000)@xmath56    by 5000 by -500    ( , ) @xmath58 by 500    by 5000    ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) [ 3000 ]    ( 16700,13000)@xmath56 ( 16700,8000)@xmath56 ( 24300,13000)@xmath56 ( 24300,8000)@xmath56    by 5000 by -500 ( , ) @xmath58 by 500 by 5000    ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) ( , ) [ 3000 ] ( , ) [ 3000 ]    ( 28800,13000)@xmath56 ( 28800,8000)@xmath56 ( 38000,13000)@xmath56 ( 38000,8000)@xmath56    by 4000 by -250 ( , ) @xmath59    ( 4000,5000)c )    ( 6500,5000)[4 ]    by 300 ( , 5300)@xmath53 by -300 ( , 5300)@xmath53 by 300 ( , )    by 2000 by -250 ( , ) @xmath60 by 250 by 2000    ( , ) [ 3 ]    ( , 5300)@xmath53    by 2000 by -250 ( , ) @xmath58 by 250 by 2000    ( , ) [ 2 ] by 300 ( , 5300)@xmath53 by 1100 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) [ 2 ] by -300 ( , 5300)@xmath53    ( 9000,1250)@xmath58 ( 11000,1500)[2 ] by 300 ( , 1700)@xmath53 by 1000 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) [ 2 ] by -300 ( , 1700)@xmath53    by 2000 by -250 ( , ) @xmath58 by 250 by 2000    ( , ) [ 2 ] by 300 ( , 1700)@xmath53 by 1000 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) by 1000 ( , ) [ 2 ] by -300 ( , 1700)@xmath53    by 2000 by -250 ( , ) @xmath59    the tree level contributions to the @xmath61 function @xmath62 are obtained from the diagrams in fig.1.a @xmath63 and therefore they only depend on @xmath64 . in the large @xmath0 limit , the relevant diagrams are those shown in fig.1.b , which are known as bubble diagrams . each of the loops contributes with the same factor and the sum of all those diagrams can be seen as a geometric series which amounts to @xmath65 where the divergent one - loop integral @xmath66 can be calculated using dimensional regularization .",
    "the result is @xmath67 where as usual @xmath68 and @xmath69 is an arbitrary renormalization scale .",
    "thus , in the large @xmath0 limit the @xmath61 function only depends on @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath70 divergencies appearing in @xmath66 can be absorbed in the renormalized higgs mass @xmath71 which can be defined as @xmath72 so that we find @xmath73 in this approach the higgs mass is the only parameter that needs renormalization and in particular there is no wave function renormalization .",
    "thus the above amplitude is an observable and @xmath69 independent quantity .",
    "this fact can be used to find the dependence of the renormalized higgs mass @xmath74 on the renormalization scale @xmath69 which turns out to be @xmath75 the renormalized coupling @xmath76 can be defined in order to keep the tree level relation @xmath77 and then its running can be easily obtained from the above evolution equation . in practice it is useful to introduce the mass parameter @xmath78 defined by the equation @xmath79 and then @xmath80 so that @xmath81 from this formula we can obtain the position @xmath14 of the landau pole in this approximation which is given by @xmath82    therefore , for @xmath52 the mass parameter is the only free parameter of the model and all the observables can be obtained in terms of it . however",
    ", this mass should not be confused with the physical higgs mass .",
    "the physical mass is the mass of the resonance appearing in the scattering channel with the same quantum numbers as the higgs particle .    in the real world ,",
    "where @xmath83 , the coset space is @xmath84 and thus the interactions are @xmath6 symmetric ( weak isospin group ) .",
    "hence there are three goldstone bosons and the scattering channels can be labelled by the third component of the isospin which can take the values @xmath85 . for an arbitrary @xmath0 it is still possible to define the appropriate generalization of the above mentioned channels which are then given by @xcite @xmath86 let us now recall that in eq.[alargen ] we had found that @xmath87 and therefore @xmath88 is the only non zero isospin channel in the large @xmath0 limit . fortunately , that is precisely the channel where the higgs would appear .",
    "customarily the amplitudes are also projected in definite total angular momentum states , leading to partial waves @xmath89 .",
    "it is also obvious that in this case only the @xmath90 survives since @xmath91 only depends on @xmath64 .",
    "indeed @xmath92 this partial wave has some properties which make the large @xmath0 limit a sensible approximation to higgs physics .",
    "first , at low energies we find @xmath93 in agreement with the weinberg low - energy theorems .",
    "second , this partial wave has the correct unitarity cut along the positive real axis of the @xmath64 variable .",
    "indeed , it can be easily checked that for physical @xmath64 values , which are located right on the unitary cut where @xmath94 , we have @xmath95 which is the elastic unitarity condition .",
    "-2.2 cm    -.5 cm     evolution of the position of the @xmath96 pole in the @xmath97 complex plane .",
    "we display the lower half of the second riemann sheet as a function of the @xmath25 parameter .",
    "notice how the distance to the real axis grows with @xmath25 , whereas the real part of the position remains bounded .",
    "the scale is the same for the three figures .",
    ".5 cm    finally , we want to remark that it is possible to find numerically that the partial wave in eq.[pawa ] has a pole in the second riemann sheet .",
    "this pole can be understood as the physical higgs resonance . in fig.2",
    "it is shown the position of this pole in the complex plane for different @xmath25 values .    for low @xmath25 values",
    "the physical higgs resonance is narrow and the standard breit - wigner description of the resonance can be safely applied .",
    "then the physical mass is just given by @xmath25 whereas the width is @xmath98 which is the tree level result .",
    "however , when @xmath25 increases , the higgs resonance becomes broader and broader .",
    "the pole migrates down in the complex plane and the breit - wigner description can not be used any more .",
    "however , the real part of the pole position remains bounded even for very large @xmath25 as can be seen in fig.4 .",
    "this feature is usually called `` saturation '' and it has also been observed in other non - perturbative approaches to the higgs dynamics . in particular this behaviour",
    "was obtained using the @xmath20 method in @xcite and @xcite , using the pad approximants in @xcite and using the large @xmath0 limit in @xcite .    -2 cm     @xmath99 versus @xmath100 for different values of the higgs mass parameter @xmath25 as defined in eq.[masspara ] . even for values as large as @xmath101 , the position of the resonance is not higher than @xmath102 .",
    "we have already stated that our aim in this work is to study the large @xmath0 limit of the higgs sector including the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "more precisely we are considering the @xmath103 limit but keeping @xmath2 and @xmath3 constant .",
    "we will see that such an approach to the gauged higgs sector turns out to be very useful since it provides a sensible description of gauge boson interactions that still allows easy calculations .",
    "in the following we will concentrate in the elastic scattering process @xmath104 where @xmath105 . in order to obtain the leading contribution in the approximation defined above",
    ", the first observation is that the diagrams at tree level are @xmath106 ( or @xmath107 ) . due to the particular way in which the large @xmath0 limit has been defined ,",
    "those graphs are @xmath108 too . to find the complete set of diagrams contributing to the large @xmath0 leading order",
    ", we have to include into the tree diagrams any possible internal loop without increasing their @xmath109 or @xmath22 power dimensions .",
    "it is fairly simple to see that that can not be accomplished with gauge boson loops . concerning the scalars",
    ", the relevant observation is that gauge bosons are only coupled to the three first @xmath51 , whereas the higgs interacts with all them .",
    "thus , the only @xmath56 loops appearing in the large @xmath0 limit are those coupled to the higgs field .",
    "the main effect of those @xmath56 loops is to contribute to the higgs propagator as it is shown in fig.1.c .",
    "note that , as far as we are working in the landau gauge , where all the @xmath56 fields are massless , many other possible @xmath56 loop diagrams vanish , since they are proportional to @xmath110 which is zero when using dimensional regularization .",
    "it is not very difficult to calculate the diagrams in fig.1.c . using the renormalization prescription of the previous section for the renormalized higgs mass , we find the higgs propagator @xmath111 where @xmath112 is defined in eq.[mr ] .",
    "it is obvious that this @xmath113 has exactly the same pole in the second riemann sheet than the @xmath90 partial wave amplitude in eq.[t00 ] , which corresponds to the physical higgs resonance . at the same time , for small @xmath25 , we find @xmath114 and thus we recover the standard perturbative ( tree level ) behavior of the higgs resonance whose width would then be given by eq.23 .",
    "therefore the above propagator describes properly the higgs resonances both in the perturbative ( light higgs ) and the non - perturbative regime ( heavy higgs ) .",

    "an important test for the consistency of the approximation is provided by the equivalence theorem ( et ) .",
    "this theorem states that the @xmath16-matrix elements of longitudinal electroweak gauge boson are the same as those of their associated would - be goldstone bosons , up to @xmath121 corrections , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 is the typical c.m .",

    "thus , on the one hand , at high energies the scattering of longitudinal gauge bosons provides information about the higgs sector of the sm . on the other hand ,",

    "one potential problem that could appear when using the et comes from the different renormalization of the gauge boson and @xmath56 wave functions @xcite .",
    "fortunately , at leading order our @xmath22 expansion does not need wave function renormalization and the et can be safely applied .    in order to illustrate the above discussion and to check our computational methods",
    "we have displayed in fig.5 the scattering cross section of @xmath140 versus that of @xmath126 .",
    "the former is represented by a continuous line whereas the latter has been drawn discontinuously .",
    "notice that to all means and purposes they overlap _ at high energies _",
    "( @xmath141 tev ) .    from fig.5 we can observe that either with or without the et , the large @xmath0 approximation is able to reproduce a well shaped higgs resonant behaviour and very good high energy properties .",
    "the small numerical differences up to almost 1.2 tev are simply due to the fact that the et is neglecting the @xmath124 contributions .",
    "thus we can summarize these two last sections by saying that the large @xmath0 meets in a very simple way all the known theoretical constraints to the sm higgs sector , like the low - energy theorems , unitarity , the saturation property and the et .",

    "the main practical application of the approach described above is of course the description of the lhc phenomenology . for this reason",
    "it will be used in this section to obtain predictions in terms of the renormalized higgs mass under the hypothesis that the msm provides the right model for the electroweak symmetry breaking . in particular",
    "we will concentrate on @xmath142 pair production , since this final state is the most sensible to the higgs resonance properties and at the same time gives rise to a very clear experimental signature .",
    "we consider both final gauge bosons decaying into the cleanest leptonic channels : @xmath143 . indeed",
    ", we have obtained the number of these events as the total number of @xmath142 pairs times the branching ratio @xmath144 .",
    "we have computed the total @xmath142 number of events at the lhc with the help of the monte - carlo vegas code @xcite . in order to relate the subprocesses cross sections to the @xmath145 initial state , we have used the effective @xmath146 approximation @xcite ( which is based on the weizsaker - williams approximation @xcite ) and the mrsd @xcite proton structure functions , which are in good agreement with recent experimental results at hera .",
    "the different subprocesses contributing to @xmath142 production that we have evaluated are @xmath147 all these channels have been calculated using the msm feynman rules within the large @xmath0 limit , which modifies the higgs boson mass and width according to our previous discussion . consequently we have used the higgs propagator given in eq.[nprop ] , so that @xmath25 remains as a free parameter .",
    "we have evaluated most of the cross sections shown in eq.[eq : procesos ] at tree level , although gluon - gluon fusion is calculated to one - loop @xcite , since it occurs via quark loops . as a consequence",
    "this cross section is quite sensitive to the top quark mass , that has been set to @xmath148 gev .    in order to compute the total number of events of the subprocesses in eq.[eq : procesos ]",
    "we have set the following expected values for the lhc parameters : the @xmath145 center of mass energy , @xmath149 tev and an integrated luminosity @xmath150 .",
    "in addition , we choose the following kinematical cuts on the maximum @xmath142 invariant mass ( @xmath151 tev ) , the minimum transverse momentum ( @xmath152 gev ) and the maximum rapidity @xmath153 . finally , in order to test the dependence on the renormalized mass parameter , we have chosen different input values for @xmath25 : @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 gev as defined in eq.[masspara ] , which cover a wide variety of regimes , from weak to strongly interacting .",

    "the contributions from different initial subprocesses are shown explicitly , although those events coming from other gauge boson pairs are listed together .",
    "the top quark mass has been fixed to @xmath148 gev .",
    "we have studied the main properties of the standard model higgs sector in the large @xmath0 limit , i.e. for a large number of would - be goldstone bosons , including the @xmath166 interactions , keeping @xmath167 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 constant . by using this approximation",
    "we have confirmed the expected behaviour from other non - perturbative approaches , both in the weak and the strong interaction regime .",
    "in particular the higgs mass saturation property .",

    "the corresponding partial wave has very good unitarity properties and it is compatible with the low - energy theorems .",
    "furthermore , the explicit introduction of gauge fields as well as the simplicity to implement this approach allow us , in contrast to most of the previous approaches , to obtain the @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath169 scattering amplitudes by means of very simple calculations , even _ without _ the help of the equivalence theorem , which nevertheless has been used to check our results . as an illustration we have applied the large @xmath0 approximation to estimate the number of @xmath142 events with the cleanest signature at the lhc , including all relevant backgrounds .",
    "the results can be found in the table .",
    "as it can be seen there , the sensibility of the number of events to the higgs mass parameter is not very large .",
    "however , it could by considerably increased with jet tagging , which could help to separate the more interesting pure fusion events from the background .",
    "we have therefore shown how the large @xmath0 , despite its simplicity ( only the propagator has to be changed ) , yields a consistent description of the higgs sector non - perturbative problems , thus improving previous approaches used to obtain predictions for the lhc",
