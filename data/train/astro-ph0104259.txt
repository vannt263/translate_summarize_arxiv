    "the nature of the galactic magnetic field has been revealed from observations of pulsar dispersion measures , starlight polarization and synchrotron emission ( heiles 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "it is composed of uniform and random components .",
    "their estimated strengths at the solar neighborhood are of order a few @xmath0 g .",
    "the scale of irregularities of the random component measured by rand & kulkarni ( 1989 ) is about @xmath1 pc .",
    "the magnetic energy density is comparable to those of other energy contents such as cosmic - rays , turbulence and gravity .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field forms one of the important constituents of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and plays a key role in its evolution . parker ( 1966 ) demonstrated that the ism is unstable due to magnetic buoyancy .",
    "the instability , referred to as the _ parker instability _",
    ", is an example demonstrating that the magnetic field is important in the dynamics of the ism .",
    "two different approaches are employed to investigate the nature of instabilities .",
    "one is the linear stability analysis , which enables us to find unstable modes and estimate their growth rate .",
    "parker ( 1966 , 1967 ) himself used this approach to show the existence of the instability . later , other authors elaborated on the instability with the same approach .",
    "a partial list includes the studies on the effects of galactic rotation ( shu 1974 ; zweibel & kulsrud 1975 ; foglizzo & tagger 1994 , 1995 ) , magnetic micro - turbulence ( zweibel & kulsrud 1975 ) , a skewed configuration of magnetic field ( hanawa , matsumoto , & shibata 1992 ) , a non - uniform nature of externally given gravity ( horiuchi et al . 1988 ; giz & shu 1993 ; kim , hong , & ryu 1997 ; kim & hong 1998 ) , the galactic corona ( kamaya et al .",
    "1997 ) , and multiple gas components ( kim et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "according to the linear analysis , the instability is broken down into two distinct modes : _ undular _ and _ interchange _ ( hughes & cattaneo 1987 ; kim et al .",
    "the former , whose perturbations are defined in the plane of gravitational field and unperturbed magnetic field , undulates magnetic field lines and induces gas to slide down along the field lines into magnetic valleys .",
    "the latter interchange mode , whose perturbations are defined in the plane perpendicular to the direction of unperturbed magnetic field , generates alternating dense and rarefied regions along the radial direction perpendicular to both the gravity and field directions and has a maximum growth rate at infinite radial wavenumber , indicating it is a rayleigh - taylor type .",
    "when perturbations are allowed in all three spatial dimensions , the _",
    "mixed mode _ of the undular and interchange modes appears ( matsumoto et al .",
    "1993 ) , which has a maximum growth rate at infinite radial wavenumber too .",
    "the other approach is through numerical simulations , where the nonlinear evolution of instabilities is studied . since the first one - dimensional study by baierlein ( 1983 )",
    ", many studies on the parker instability under different conditions have been done : matsumoto et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and matsumoto & shibata ( 1992 ) explored the nature of the undular and mixed modes in accretion disk environments .",
    "shibata et al .",
    "( 1989a , 1989b ) , kaisig et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and nozawa et al .",
    "( 1992 ) considered the parker instability as the driving mechanism for emergent flux tubes in the sun , and tried to explain several features of the solar activity .",
    "basu , mouschovias , & paleologou ( 1997 ) and kim et al . ( 1998 ) performed multi - dimensional simulations of the instability in a thin gaseous disk under the influence of a simplified uniform gravity and addressed the issue of the origin of the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "santilln et al .",
    "( 2000 ) simulated the evolution of the parker instability in a more realistic galactic disk with multiple gas components .",
    "especially , kim et al . (",
    "1998 ) used high - resolution three - dimensional simulations to follow the nonlinear evolution of the mixed mode .",
    "they found that after linear growth perturbations become saturated in the nonlinear stage while forming chaotic structures . on top of that",
    ", alternating regions of magnetic arches and valleys are developed .",
    "the chaotic motions induce reconnection , especially in the valley regions , which allows gas to cross field lines . as a result ,",
    "gas and magnetic field are redistributed into a stable system in the relaxed stage .    in this paper",
    "we begin to investigate the effects of rotation on the nonlinear parker instability . for simplicity",
    ", we consider _ uniform rotation_. eventually , it is necessary to address the effects of _ differential rotation_. but we will leave it for a future work .",
    "it is known through linear analyses ( shu 1974 ; zweibel & kulsrud 1975 ) that uniform rotation reduces the growth rate of the undular mode .",
    "it is the coriolis force that prevents the lateral motion and reduces the growth rate .",
    "however , as shown in  2 , the coriolis force affects less the linear growth of the three - dimensional mixed mode .",
    "the reason is the following : the normal modes have small wavelengths along the radial direction , and the most unstable mode has a vanishing wavelength .",
    "hence , the perturbed velocity in the linear stage is predominantly along the vertical direction , the direction of the rotation vector , so it does not interfere with the rotation .",
    "but yet , from this it is not clear how the coriolis force affects the nonlinear evolution .",
    "related to that , chou et al .",
    "( 1997 ) studied rotating flux tubes numerically , modeling the evolution of the emergent magnetic flux sheet .",
    "they demonstrated that the emergent flux sheet becomes twisted due to the coriolis force , and explained the tilted active regions observed in the sun in terms of twisted flux sheets .",
    "they , however , chose perturbations with a pair of finite horizontal wavelengths that do not correspond to the mode of the maximum growth rate , and performed numerical experiments with low resolution .",
    "miller & stone ( 2000 ) studied in the environment of accretion disks the effects of differential rotation .",
    "they focused on the role of the magneto - rotational instability , but also commented on the role of the parker instability too . here , we study the nonlinear evolution of the parker instability in the environment of the galactic disk , which is initiated by _ random perturbations _ , through _ high - resolution _ , three - dimensional numerical simulations of the parker instability .",
    "high - resolution and three - dimensions are required to resolve the small - scale structures of the mixed mode .",
    "random perturbations are necessary to find the mode preferred by the system .    the parker instability has been thought to be a mechanism in forming the gmcs in the galaxy ( appenzeller 1974 ; mouschovias , shu , & woodward 1974 ; blitz & shu 1980 ; shibata & matsumoto 1991 ; handa et al .",
    "1992 ; gomez de castro & pudritz 1992 ) .",
    "the conjecture is based on the results from two - dimensional linear analyses of the undular mode that the growth time and wavelength of the most unstable mode are comparable to the life time and the separation of the gmcs .",
    "however , it has been known from earlier work by parker ( 1967 ) that the instability initiated by three - dimensional perturbations develops the mixed mode at its maximum growth rate with vanishing wavelength along the radial direction .",
    "in addition , kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed in three - dimensional simulations that sheet - like structures with smallest scale along the radial direction , whose shape is different from that of observed gmcs , form at the developing stage of the instability and persist during the nonlinear stage .",
    "furthermore , they showed that the enhancement factor of column density relative to its initial value is only @xmath2 , which is too small for the gmc formation .",
    "we will revisit the issue of the gmc formation by the parker instability with the results on the effects of rotation on the instability .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we summarize the problem including numerical set - up and linear analysis . in  3 ,",
    "results of numerical simulations are presented .",
    "summary and discussion follow in  4 .",
    "in order to describe the effects of rotation on the parker instability at the solar neighborhood , we introduce a local cartesian coordinate system , which is rotating with the galactic angular velocity @xmath3 at the sun s position , @xmath4 . in this local frame , the coordinates are defined as @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , and their directions are parallel to radial , azimuthal , and vertical directions of the galaxy , respectively . assuming a constant angular speed , the isothermal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations with a downward uniform gravity ( @xmath8 ) are : @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an isothermal sound speed and other notations have their usual meanings .",
    "note that we do nt take into account the centrifugal force in eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) , since the force is canceled out by the radial component of the gravitational force .",
    "the above equations are the same as those solved in kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) except the coriolis force term in the momentum equation .    as in kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the initial distributions of gas and magnetic field have been set up in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "dropping the terms containing time derivative and velocity in eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) and assuming i ) uni - directional horizontal magnetic field ( @xmath13\\hat{y}$ ] ) , and ii ) a constant ratio of magnetic to gas pressures @xmath14/(8\\pi \\rho_0[z]a^2 $ ] ) , then density and magnetic pressure are described by an exponential function , @xmath15 where the scale height of the gas is defined as @xmath16 .",
    "a computational cube with @xmath17 is placed at the solar neighborhood , where @xmath18 is the azimuthal wavelength of the maximum linear growth for the undular mode ( see the next subsection ) . to initiate the instability , random velocity perturbations are added .",
    "the standard deviation of each velocity component is set to be @xmath19 .",
    "boundaries are periodic along the radial and azimuthal ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) directions and reflecting along the vertical ( @xmath7 ) direction . as the result ,",
    "fluid quantities are conserved and expulsion of magnetic flux through the upper boundary is prohibited .",
    "the above isothermal mhd equations are solved by an mhd code described in kim et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which is the isothermal version of the mhd code based on the explicit , finite - difference total variation diminishing ( tvd ) scheme ( ryu & jones 1995 ; ryu , jones , & frank 1995 ) .",
    "three - dimensional simulations have been performed for the cases with and without rotation , using different resolutions .",
    "model parameters of the simulations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "model @xmath22 are the cases without rotation .",
    "the highest resolution case , model 3 , is the same one as that reported in kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) except that model 3 extends to a longer end time , @xmath23 .",
    "we note that model 3 does not simply extend that of kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but has been re - calculated with a different set of initial random numbers . the case with rotation , model 4 , has the angular velocity @xmath24 , which is consistent with the galactic circular speed ( 27 km s@xmath25 kpc@xmath25 ) based on hipparcos data ( feast & whitelook 1997 ) .",
    "all models are assumed to have @xmath26 , so that magnetic pressure is initially the same as gas pressure .",
    "physical quantities of length , speed , density and magnetic field are given in units of the density scale height , @xmath27 , the isothermal sound speed , @xmath12 , the initial density at @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the initial field strength at @xmath28 , @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "for the typical values of @xmath31 km s@xmath25 and @xmath32 pc ( falgarone & lequeux 1973 ) , the resulting time unit , @xmath33 , becomes @xmath34 years .",
    "it is well known that the real interstellar medium is composed of multiple components with various scale heights .",
    "some of them have the scale heights different from our choice , 160 pc ( see eq . [ 5 ] in kim et al .",
    "so our single gas component model under uniform gravity would be too simplistic .",
    "however , it is the model which has been most extensively used since the pioneering work done by parker ( 1966 ) . especially , the effect of uniform rotation on the instability was already investigated through linear analyses using the same model ( see next subsection ) .",
    "choosing the well - studied model would enable us to single out the consequences of rotation on the parker instability in the numerical simulations , which is the primary goal of this paper .",
    "we note that two - dimensional numerical simulations of the parker instability under a more realistic galactic disk model were performed in santilln et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as noted in the introduction .",
    "criteria for the parker instability are given in terms of an effective adiabatic index .",
    "if the adiabatic index is less than a critical value , the above system becomes unstable ( parker 1966 , 1967 ; hughes & cattaneo 1987 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "the critical adiabatic index for the undular mode is @xmath35 , while that for the interchange mode is @xmath36 .",
    "the critical adiabatic index for the mixed mode is @xmath37 .",
    "our consideration of isothermality corresponds to @xmath38 and the models have @xmath26 .",
    "so the initial system is unstable against the undular mode as well as the mixed mode , but stable to the interchange mode .",
    "dispersion relations from linear stability analyses provide the growth rate and wavelength of unstable modes and help set the size of the computational cube . in fig .",
    "1 , the dispersion relations for the exponentially - stratified magnetized disk are reproduced ( see , parker 1966 , 1967 ; shu 1974 ; zweibel & kulsrud 1975 ) .",
    "the solid line represents the unstable undular mode , which is initiated by two - dimensional ( @xmath21 and @xmath7 ) perturbations , without rotation .",
    "perturbations undulate azimuthal field lines and induces gas to slide down along the field lines into magnetic valleys .",
    "the undular mode has a preferred wavelength ( @xmath39 ) along the azimuthal direction , which has been set as the size of our computational cube .",
    "inclusion of rigid - body rotation in the undular mode reduces the growth rate as well as the wavelength of the most unstable mode ( see the dashed line ) , because lateral motion along the field lines is hampered by the coriolis force .",
    "when additional radial perturbations are applied , both the undular and interchange mode work together , and the resulting mixed ( undular + interchange ) mode becomes more unstable than the undular mode alone . in the extreme case with infinite radial wavenumber ,",
    "the growth rates do not depend on angular speed ( see the dotted line ) .",
    "this is because the perturbations with large radial wavenumbers generate mostly vertical motions , which do not interfere with the coriolis force . with infinite radial wavenumber ,",
    "the growth rate of the most unstable mode is @xmath40 and its wavelength is @xmath41 .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the dispersion relation with radial wavelength equal to @xmath42 , about a quarter of the box size .",
    "the maximum growth rate @xmath43 , in this case , is slightly smaller than that for vanishing radial wavelength , but the wavelength of the most unstable mode is similar in the two situations .",
    "our simulations correspond to conditions somewhat between the dotted and dot - dashed lines .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the pure interchange mode is stable , we see the characteristics of the interchange mode in the dispersion relation of the mixed mode .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "when three - dimensional perturbations are applied to the initial system , it quickly adjusts itself by forming alternating regions of compression and rarefaction along the radial direction .",
    "both alternating regions are now subject to the undular instability . for smaller wavenumbers ,",
    "the undular instability in each rarefied region develops faster with the help of buoyancy due to the neighboring dense regions .",
    "that is why the fastest growing mode has @xmath44 .",
    "the dispersion relations in fig .",
    "1 have shown that the most unstable mode has vanishing wavelengths along the radial direction .",
    "this has guided us to use the highest resolution ( using up to @xmath45 grid zones ) achievable with our computing resources .",
    "even with the highest resolution , it is however not possible to resolve all the small scale structures that are expected to form in the simulations .",
    "bearing this fact in mind , we compare in fig .",
    "2 isodensity surfaces at the same epoch ( @xmath46 ) but with different resolutions using @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath45 zones ( model 1 , 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the computational boxes are oriented in such a way that the radial ( @xmath20 ) , the azimuthal ( @xmath21 ) , and the vertical ( @xmath7 ) directions are from left to right , from near to far , and from bottom to top , respectively . a gray surface with equal density @xmath49 is included in each box , which was initially a flat surface at @xmath50 .",
    "the first impression is that the density structure in the low - resolution ( @xmath47 zones ) simulation looks very different from that in the high - resolution ( @xmath45 zones ) .",
    "similarly , it looks like large - scale , ordered structures are formed in the low - resolution . on the other hand , small - scale ,",
    "chaotic structures are clear in the high - resolution , which are expected from linear stability analyses .",
    "this justifies the usage of resources to perform high - resolution simulations . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss only the results of high - resolution simulations , model 3 and 4 .",
    "since the instability has been initiated by random perturbations , no preferred wavelength has been introduced .",
    "but the upper and lower limits of available wavelengths are set by the finite size of the computational box , which is @xmath18 , and the numerical resolution of the code , respectively . in general",
    ", the number of grid zones required to resolve one wavelength is different from problem to problem and from code to code .",
    "it is our experience that our code needs @xmath51 grid zones along one direction to cover one wavelength in the current simulations without excessive numerical dissipation . with 256 zones ,",
    "the smallest wavelength that can be resolved would be @xmath52 , and @xmath53 wavy structures are accommodated along one direction .",
    "3 plots the time evolution of the rms velocity ( volume averaged , not mass averaged ) in the simulations for the case without rotation ( @xmath54 , left panel ) and with rotation ( @xmath55 , right panel ) .",
    "the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath7 components are drawn with dotted , short dash , and long dash lines , respectively . the solid line corresponds to the maximum linear growth rate , 0.41 . during the initial transient stage ( @xmath56 ) ,",
    "random perturbations adjust themselves by generating one - dimensional magnetosonic waves , which move vertically , as pointed out in kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and santilln et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . on top of the magnetosonic waves ,",
    "there are slow mhd waves that eventually develop into the unstable mode ( shu 1974 ; kim et al .",
    "as the slow mhd waves grow , the fluctuating and propagation features of the magnetosonic waves gradually diminish .    as in kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the evolution can be divided into three stages : _ linear _ , _ nonlinear _ , and _ relaxed_. the linear stage lasts until @xmath57 for @xmath54 and @xmath58 for @xmath55 . in both cases ,",
    "the slope of linear growth is close to 0.41 .",
    "this demonstrates that numerical resolution is fine enough to follow the modes that have small radial wavelengths . at the end of the linear stage",
    ", the rms of @xmath59 is saturated near @xmath60 , which is comparable to the isothermal sound speed .",
    "this implies that the linear approximation goes well beyond its conventional limit .",
    "after saturation , the evolution enters the nonlinear stage . as pointed out in kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , due to the manifestation of the interchange mode , the structures formed in the nonlinear stage are characterized as chaotic ( see  3.4 ) . on top of the chaotic structures ,",
    "the undular mode causes magnetic field lines to drop at valley regions and rise at arch regions . along",
    "those undulated field lines , gas supersonically falls toward valley bottoms and is stopped by shock waves .",
    "the gas ends up forming condensations at the valley bottoms . in the case without rotation ,",
    "the condensations become over - compressed due to the continual falling of the gas .",
    "this is apparent in the left panel of fig . 3 for @xmath54 around @xmath61 , when the rms of @xmath62 shows its local minimum .",
    "after that , the increased pressure pushes the valley matter back to the upper regions .",
    "this is recurrent , but with the rms of @xmath62 decreasing .",
    "at the same time , reconnection , enhanced by chaotic motions , allows re - distribution of mass and magnetic field and the system evolves into a new equilibrium state described in kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that is stable against the instability . for this reason @xmath63",
    "is labeled as the relaxed stage . however , in the case with rotation , the in - falling gas speed is reduced by the coriolis force , and so the signature of a local minima is not quite so dramatic .",
    "hence , distinguishing the relaxed stage from the nonlinear stage is less obvious .    a close examination of fig .",
    "3 reveals the following further differences between the two cases .",
    "i ) the rms of @xmath59 reaches its peak value 0.78 at @xmath64 for @xmath54 , while the peak value reaches 0.74 at @xmath57 for @xmath55 .",
    "the difference is not large because the velocity has been small prior to the nonlinear stage .",
    "but it is the coriolis force that makes the rms variations saturated at a lower level and at an earlier time epoch in the case with rotation .",
    "ii ) the rms values of both @xmath65 and @xmath62 become converged in the case without rotation , while the rms of @xmath62 is always larger than that of @xmath65 in the case with rotation .",
    "this is because the coriolis force affects only the horizontal flow .      to examine the global properties of the instability further",
    ", we have followed the evolution of kinetic , magnetic , gravitational , and heat energies , which are defined as @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 where integrals cover the whole computation box , @xmath70 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath71 is the gas pressure ( mouschovias 1974 ) .",
    "we take @xmath72 as the normalization unit for the energies .",
    "time evolution of the normalized energies is plotted in fig .",
    "4a by solid lines for @xmath54 and dotted lines for @xmath55 .",
    "the general behavior has a distinct feature at each evolutionary stage .",
    "the energies remain unchanged during the linear stage , show significant variation during the nonlinear stage , and then slowly converge to final values in the relaxed stage . during the linear stage , velocity is less than the isothermal speed , and the coriolis force is relatively small .",
    "so we can not notice any visible difference in energies between the two cases with and without rotation .",
    "however , as the coriolis force becomes stronger in the nonlinear stage , differences appear .",
    "variation for @xmath55 is less severe , showing a slower increase or decrease than that for @xmath54 .",
    "this is because the flow induced by the instability has been slowed down by the coriolis force . but",
    "the increase or decrease of energies lasts longer .",
    "hence , the energies eventually converge to the same final values in both cases in the relaxed stage .",
    "this implies the final energetics of the instability is insensitive to rotation .    in fig .",
    "4a , we see a bump in the curve of the kinetic energy , @xmath73 .",
    "it is barely noticeable , although the rms velocities are comparable to the isothermal speed during the nonlinear stage ( see fig .",
    "this is because most flow activities either occur in the upper , low density regions or are localized in the magnetic valleys . as gas in higher positions accumulates into the magnetic valleys , gravitational energy , @xmath74 , is released and becomes available to the system .",
    "some of it is used to increase the kinetic energy , and other is converted to work done by gas .",
    "the heat energy , @xmath75 , measures the amount of this work ( mouschovias 1974 ) .",
    "the total magnetic flux is conserved in our simulations due to the imposed boundaries , but the magnetic energy , @xmath76 , decreases .",
    "the reason is the following . as the instability develops , although it becomes compressed in a localized regions of magnetic valleys , the magnetic field , which is initially concentrated around the equatorial plane ( see eq .",
    "4 ) , spreads upwards overall .",
    "this is because magnetic field lines manage to slip away mass due to enhanced reconnection .",
    "a given amount of magnetic flux that is less concentrated has less energy .",
    "the final , converged value of the magnetic energy will be the energy of uniformly distributed magnetic field whose flux is same as the initial flux .",
    "mouschovias ( 1974 ) defined the energy integral of the system described in  2.1 as @xmath77 and showed that it is a constant of motion .",
    "that is , the energy released from certain forms should end up to increase the energy in other forms .",
    "matsumoto et al . (",
    "1990 ) showed , however , that the energy integral in their simulations of the parker instability in a point - mass - dominated gravity is not a conserved quantity when shocks are generated .",
    "our simulations have confirmed this .",
    "the curves labeled with @xmath78 in fig .",
    "4b are constant up to the end of the linear stage , since no shock has been developed yet",
    ". however , as soon as the nonlinear stage begins ( so the increase in the kinetic energy becomes noticeable ) , shocks form in the valley regions , so the energy integral starts to decrease .",
    "when the system enters the relaxed stage , it gradually settles to the final equilibrium state where all shocks have disappeared .",
    "then , the energy integral stays constant again .      to illustrate the structures resulting from the instability ,",
    "three - dimensional images are shown in fig .",
    "the perspective images of density structure and magnetic field lines are at two epochs of the linear stage ( @xmath79 , upper panels ) and the nonlinear stage ( @xmath80 , lower panels ) , respectively .",
    "the images only for @xmath55 are presented , since the corresponding images for @xmath54 look similar . also refer to the images for @xmath54 in fig . 2 and in kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , although they are drawn at different epochs .",
    "a gray surface with density @xmath49 is depicted in each left panel as in fig .",
    "2 , while 64 field lines , whose starting points lie along the line of @xmath50 and @xmath81 , are drawn in each right panel . at @xmath82 ,",
    "the field lines are straight and lie in the @xmath50 plane .",
    "as mentioned in  2.2 , in the linear stage , the interchange mode induces alternating regions of compression and rarefaction along the @xmath20-direction , while the undular mode bends magnetic field lines vertically .",
    "those features are clearly seen in the images of the linear stage .",
    "the isodensity surface in the left upper panel of fig .",
    "5 is corrugated along the @xmath20-direction , which is the defining feature of the interchange mode .",
    "the field lines in the right upper panel go up and down along the @xmath21-direction making valley and arch regions , which is the distinguishing feature of undular mode .",
    "as the instability develops , the alternating structures become complicated . at the same time",
    ", the density contrast between valley and arch regions becomes large .",
    "the isodensity surface in the left lower panel shows bumps at the valley and dents at the arch regions .",
    "there is no regular occurrence pattern of the bumps and dents , even though the corrugations of the surface along the @xmath20-direction are still preserved in this stage .",
    "the distribution of the field lines becomes complicated too .",
    "as more gas moves along field lines from the arch to the valley , the arch field lines move to even higher positions and the valley field lines move down to lower positions , as clearly shown in the right lower panel .",
    "an effect of rotation on nonlinear structures is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , where two field lines together with velocity vectors along them are plotted at @xmath83 .",
    "both are examples of valley and arch field lines .",
    "flow velocity along those undulated field lines becomes large in the nonlinear stage .",
    "so flows are under the strong influence of the coriolis force .",
    "as gas in - falls along the valley field line , flow velocity increases and reaches its maximum around the bottom of the valley .",
    "the near side gas along the left field line in fig .",
    "6 experiences the force in the @xmath84 direction , while the far side gas experiences the oppositely directed force .",
    "these forces induce the largest oppositely twisting velocities around the bottom , which cause the bottom part of the undulated field line to become twisted .",
    "a similar situation occurs along the arch field line in the right side of fig .",
    "this time , the near side gas from the arch is deflected toward the @xmath85 direction and the far side gas is deflected toward the @xmath84 direction . however ,",
    "the flow velocity is smaller around the tip of the arch , so the field line is not twisted .",
    "comparing the field lines at the valley and arch regions , we find that the curvature of the arch field is larger than that of the valley field .",
    "note we have started our simulations only with uniform magnetic field . but",
    "the field lines , which have been bent in magnetic valley regions , get twisted due to the coriolis force .",
    "since the direction of twisted lines changes rapidly , they may be regarded as a `` random '' field .",
    "so the coriolis force has played a role of converting the uniform component of magnetic field into the random one .",
    "assuming that the scale of the twisting is comparable to the size of condensations formed in valley regions , 100 pc ( see the next subsection ) , it is not far from the single - cell - size of the galactic random field measured in rand and kulkarni ( 1989 ) .",
    "the structures formed are further illustrated by examining the column densities defined by @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 we have kept track of the evolution of the vertical column density , @xmath89 , and plotted in fig . 7 its minimum and maximum as functions of time .",
    "solid lines correspond to @xmath54 and dotted lines to @xmath55 .",
    "both cases show a similar trend of evolution .",
    "initially @xmath89 stays close to unity for all @xmath20 and @xmath21 . as gas starts to fall into valleys in the linear stage , the contrast between the minimum and maximum increases .",
    "it reaches peaks in the nonlinear stage and decreases during later evolution .",
    "in addition , there are differences between the two cases : i ) the peak of the maximum @xmath89 for @xmath55 ( 1.5 ) is smaller than that ( 2.1 ) for @xmath54 , indicating the nonlinear structures are less acute , ii ) the maximum @xmath89 for @xmath55 peaks at later time , indicating the nonlinear structures develop more slowly , iii ) the maximum @xmath89 for @xmath55 is broader , indicating the nonlinear activity lasts longer .",
    "all these are attributed to the effects of the coriolis force , and agree with the descriptions in  3.2 and 3.3 .    at @xmath46 for @xmath54 and @xmath90 for @xmath55 around the peaks of the maximum @xmath89 , the distributions of @xmath89 in the @xmath91 plane",
    "are drawn in fig .",
    "8 . in each panel ,",
    "equal column - density contours overlie a gray - scale map .",
    "thick solid lines that correspond to @xmath92 trace out the boundaries of over and under - dense regions .",
    "over - dense regions are labeled with thin solid lines and dark grays , whereas under - dense regions are labeled with dotted lines and light grays . in the case without rotation ( see fig .",
    "8a ) sheet - like structures form , whose long dimension is aligned with the initial field ( @xmath21- ) direction , as pointed out in kim et al .",
    "similar structures are formed in the case with rotation , but the long dimension is a bit tilted with respect to the @xmath21-direction and the shape is a bit rounder ( see fig .",
    "the tilting is of course the consequence of the coriolis force , @xmath93 .",
    "note that due to the periodic nature of our boundaries , the allowed angle for tilting is quantized and given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 s can have the values of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 ( @xmath18 is the box size ) .",
    "8b shows that @xmath100 is close to @xmath101 , corresponding to @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "those coincide with ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) of the structure most visible in the figure .    while the @xmath89 map illustrates the vertically developed structures , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are more closely compared with observations in the galaxy .",
    "considering that the initial field direction is parallel to @xmath21-direction and the sheet - like structure is almost aligned with that direction , @xmath106 and @xmath107 represent two extremes : the line - of - sight is perpendicular ( @xmath106 ) to and parallel ( @xmath107 ) to the mean field direction",
    ". the observed column density would be somewhere between the two .",
    "contours with equal @xmath106 and @xmath107 are plotted in left and right panels of fig .",
    "9 , respectively , for the case with rotation at @xmath80 .",
    "we have chosen 10 contours whose column densities are @xmath108 of the initial midplane value .",
    "so initially the contours were straight and equally spaced .",
    "each contour in the left panel shows one or two bumps along the @xmath21-direction , which are attributed to the manifestation of the undular mode . on the other hand ,",
    "the counterpart in the right panel is more irregular and shows many bumps along the @xmath20-direction , which are attributed to the manifestation of the interchange mode .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the parker instability in non - rotating and uniformly rotating magnetized disks through high resolution numerical simulations ( using up to @xmath45 grid zones ) . the main purpose of this paper is to address the effects of rotation on the instability by comparing the two cases . here",
    "our findings are summarized .",
    "first , the overall evolution of the instability in a uniformly rotating disk is similar to that in a non - rotating disk . as in the case without rotation ( kim et al .",
    "1998 ) , the evolution in the case with rotation is divided into three stages : linear , nonlinear , and relaxed . in the linear stage , the mixed mode regulates the evolution , as predicted in linear stability analyses .",
    "that is , exponentially growing perturbations have a preferred scale along the azimuthal direction but have the smallest possible scale along the radial direction . in the nonlinear stage",
    ", the growth is saturated . the undular mode bends magnetic field lines , forming valleys and arches , but overall flow motions appear chaotic . after becoming fully developed",
    ", the nonlinear oscillatory structures damp out , and at the same time , reconnection enhanced by chaotic motions allows re - distribution of mass and magnetic field . at this stage , the system enters the relaxed stage , although the boundary between the nonlinear and relaxed stages is not as clear as in the case without rotation .",
    "second , the coriolis force introduces a couple of visible differences .",
    "one of them is the twisting of magnetic field lines in valley regions . in the case with rotation ,",
    "gas is subject to the coriolis force , whenever there are lateral motions .",
    "but the force is especially strong in valley regions , because the falling speed of gas toward those regions becomes comparable to or faster than the isothermal sound speed .",
    "flows approaching valleys from two sides along the field lines experience the oppositely directed coriolis forces , so the field lines there get twisted .",
    "the scale of the twisting is comparable to the size of the valleys , and is @xmath109 pc or less .",
    "it is noticeable that this scale of twisting is compatible with `` single - cell size '' of random magnetic field measured by rand & kulkarni ( 1989 ) .",
    "third , we have found that the maximum enhancement factors of vertical column density are 2.1 for the case without rotation , and 1.5 for the case with rotation . in the former case ,",
    "the enhanced sheet - like structures , viewed from the vertical column density map , are aligned with the direction of mean magnetic field . on the other hand , in the latter case",
    ", the structures are slightly tilted with respect to the field direction and a bit rounder .",
    "this is because the lateral motions of gas are affected by the coriolis force .    in our previous study of kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we concluded that it is difficult to regard the parker instability _",
    "alone _ as the formation mechanism of gmcs , because i ) the sheet - like shape of the structures formed is different from the shape of gmcs and ii ) the density enhancement factor is too small .",
    "the inclusion of rotation does not change this conclusion .",
    "however , we do not completely rule out the role of the parker instability in the formation of gmcs .",
    "inclusion of radiative cooling and self - gravity may result in thermal and gravitational instabilities , which certainly increase the density enhancement factor far more than the one brought by the parker instability alone and shape structures in a different way . in the context of a more complicated system with cooling and self - gravity , the parker instability agglomerates diffuse gas into magnetic valley regions , which provide a more conducive environment to both thermal and gravitational instabilities .",
    "afterward , they may override the parker instability , especially in each magnetic valley region , and govern later evolution .",
    "here we want to emphasize that other physical processes , such as thermal and gravitational instabilities , are required to get more than factor of 2 increase in vertical column density .    because of the sheet - like shape of the nonlinear structures aligned with the mean magnetic field , the horizontal column density , which is an observable quantity in the galaxy , depends on the angle between the line - of - sight and the field direction .",
    "when they are aligned with each other , the column density map illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "9 shows vertical filamentary structures .",
    "so we suggest that the parker instability would be a possible mechanism for the formation of the interstellar filamentary structures .",
    "the `` filament 1 '' revealed in a h@xmath110 survey ( haffner , reynolds , & tufte 1998 ) is the most plausible observed candidate that may have been induced by the parker instability .",
    "it is about kpc - long , has arc - shaped morphology , and resides at high latitude .",
    "these are essentially the attributes of the parker instability .",
    "it is , however , difficult to make a direct comparison between our simulations and their observations , because the galactic environment at the location ( about 1 kpc away from the sun to the direction of @xmath111 ) of the `` filament 1 '' could be different from that in the solar neighborhood .",
    "it may be an interesting project to perform a direct numerical modeling for the filament 1 .    in this paper",
    ", we have studied the effects of uniform rotation , although differential rotation is a proper description of the galactic rotation law .",
    "inclusion of differential rotation into magnetized gas disks would complicate the situation , because not only the parker instability but also the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; balbus & hawley 1991 ; hawley & balbus 1991 ) can come into existence .",
    "the evolution of the two instabilities in accretion disks was studied , for instance , by miller & stone ( 2000 ) through three - dimensional simulations .",
    "however , the mri in the galactic disk is not as active as in accretion disks or even can be stabilized , because the galactic magnetic field is very strong .",
    "but it is not clear whether the mri is completely suppressed for the following reason .",
    "as the parker instability proceeds , high-@xmath110 arch regions and low-@xmath110 valley regions are segregated .",
    "the arch regions are stable to the mri , due to even stronger magnetic fields , but the valley regions may be subject to the mri .",
    "the action of the two instabilities on magnetic field is different . the parker instability pumps field lines vertically , while the mri stretches them radially .",
    "together these instabilities and differential rotation , along with dissipation and/or reconnection mechanisms of magnetic field may serve as the ingredients of the galactic dynamo ( tout & pringle 1992 ) .",
    "this line of approach on the galactic dynamo would be worthy of further detailed investigations .",
    "we would like to thank don cox and bob benjamin , who reviewed this paper .",
    "they picked up a mistake in fig . 4 and provided several suggestions / comments which improved the paper .",
    "the work by dr was supported in part by the grant krf-99 - 015-di0113 .",
    "the work by twj was supported in part by the nsf through grants int95 - 11654 and ast96 - 19438 , by nasa grant nag5 - 5055 and by the university of minnesota supercomputing institute ."
