    "since their discovery in 1956 , neutrinos have always surprised physicists due to their unexpected properties , often challenging our basic understanding of the standard model of particle physics ( in the remainder of the article , it will be called simply the standard model ) and the properties of elementary particles . in particular",
    ", the discovery of neutrino flavour oscillations stands as one of the most convincing proofs that the standard model is incomplete as it does not explain all the known experimental properties of the fundamental particles .",
    "the neutrino research success has been made possible mostly due to many dedicated experiments performed during the last fifty years .",
    "it is worth highlighting the contributions of some pioneering experiments , among others , such as the super - kamiokande detector  @xcite where the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos was discovered , and the sno detector  @xcite where the fluxes of all neutrino flavour species produced in the sun s core were measured for the first time .",
    "many other experiments done during the previous decades have contributed for the success of this story , in particular , the solar neutrino experiments . despite their technical complexities",
    ", these experiments were able to measure the electron neutrino fluxes coming from the sun and played a major role in the establishment of the so - called solar neutrino problem  a discrepancy between the theoretical prediction of neutrino fluxes and their experimental measurements : the experimental value being one third of the predicted value .",
    "this fact was evidenced for the first time by the homestake experiment of ray davis  @xcite , and confirmed by many other experiments that followed .",
    "it was the solar neutrino problem that prompted the development of the neutrino flavour oscillation model .",
    "if indeed the previous generation of solar neutrino detectors has been one of the beacons of particle physics , both by leading the way in uncovering the basic properties of particles , including the nature of neutrino flavour oscillations , and by being responsible for developing pioneering techniques in experimental neutrino detection  @xcite , the next generation of detectors is equally promising in discovering new physics . among various",
    ", some of which will be looking for evidence of neutrino new physics we can mention the following future detectors : the low energy neutrino astronomy  ( lena , * ? ? ? * ) , the jiangmen underground neutrino observatory  ( juno , * ? ? ? * ) , the deep underground neutrino experiment  ( dune , * ? ? ? * ) , the no@xmath6a neutrino experiment  ( no@xmath6a , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the jinping neutrino experiment  ( jinping , * ? ? ?",
    "these detectors will measure with high precision the neutrino fluxes and neutrino spectra of a few key neutrino nuclear reactions , such as the @xmath7b electron - neutrino ( @xmath7b@xmath8 ) spectrum produced by the @xmath9-decay process in the @xmath7b solar ( chain ) reaction : @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to probe in detail the sun s core , including the search for new neutrino physics interaction or even new physics processes .",
    "moreover , the high quality of the data will enable the development of inversion techniques for determining basic properties of the solar plasma  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "specific examples can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "equally , solar neutrino data can be used to find specific features associated with possible new physical processes present in the sun s interior  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such as the possibility of an isothermal solar core associated with the presence of dark matter  @xcite .    today , the basic principles of neutrino physics are firmly established , neutrinos are massive particles with a lepton flavours mix .",
    "the parameters describing neutrino flavour oscillations are measured with great accuracy and precision , which has been possible due to the extensive studies made by many different types of neutrino experiments : solar and atmospheric neutrino observatories , nuclear reactors and experimental particle accelerators  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "section  [ sb - nodp ] presents the status of the current neutrino oscillation parameters obtained from up - to - date experimental data .    even if many properties of neutrinos are known , many others are still a mystery :    - firstly , are neutrinos majorana or dirac fermions ?",
    "i.e. , are neutrinos their own anti - particle ?",
    "although the theoretical expectation favours the first option , only experimental evidence can settle this question ;    - secondly , what is the mass hierarchy of neutrinos ?",
    "in other words , does the order of neutrino masses between the different particle families follow a _",
    "normal hierarchy _  two light neutrinos followed by a heavier one , or an _ inverted hierarchy _  one light neutrino follow by two heavier ones ?    together with the cp violation in the lepton sector , these are the most important questions of neutrino physics . some of these questions will be answered by the next generation of neutrino experiments  the long baseline neutrino experiments and solar neutrino telescopes .",
    "nevertheless , it is necessary to improve the current neutrino flavour model to take full advantage of the forthcoming experimental data .    despite the success of the current neutrino physics model in explaining most of the neutrino",
    "s known observed properties , the solution encountered clearly indicate the existence of new physics beyond the standard model . as such , this implies that within the current particle physics theoretical framework , experiments can study neutrinos in other types of interactions .",
    "when such processes occur , these lead to important modifications of the physical mechanisms by which neutrinos are created , propagate and interact with other particles of the standard model .",
    "this new class of neutrino interactions is usually known as non - standard interactions ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the non - standard interactions of neutrinos have been extensively studied in the literature , among others reviews on this topic , see for instance  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the constraints on the @xmath11 parameters and their effects for low energy neutrinos have been derived from a great variety of experimental results . until now",
    "no definitive evidence of non - standard interactions has been provided by the experimental data . actually , all observations made as yet can be explained in terms of the standard interactions of the three known neutrinos , although some of them need the help of sterile neutrinos .",
    "nevertheless , in some cases the non - standard interactions of neutrinos provide an interesting and valid alternative  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )    in this work we are mostly concerned with the non - standard interactions of solar neutrinos .",
    "these interactions can affect the neutrino production inside the sun , the detection of neutrinos by experimental detectors and the neutrino propagation in the earth s and sun s interiors .",
    "in particular , our study focus on the propagation of neutrinos through baryonic matter in the sun s interior , a process usually known as the generalized mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( @xmath12 ) oscillation mechanism , or generalized matter effect oscillations .",
    "our goal is to make predictions about the modifications imprinted by this new generalized @xmath12 on the shape of the solar neutrino spectrum produced by some of the ( pp ) and carbon - nitrogen - oxygen ( cno ) key nuclear reactions , like @xmath0 and @xmath1 neutrino spectra .",
    "the high quality of the standard solar model in reproducing the measured solar neutrino fluxes , and the observed acoustic frequency oscillations , make it a privileged tool to look for the new interactions within a generalized mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein mechanism occurring in the sun s interior . the standard solar model  ( ssm , * ? ? ? * ) partly validated by helioseismology , predicts that the density inside the sun varies from about 150 @xmath13 in the centre of the star , to 1 @xmath14 at half of the solar radius .",
    "the variation of density of matter with the solar radius is followed by identical variations on the local quantities of electrons and quarks .",
    "moreover , the different type of quarks will also be affected by the local distribution of chemical elements ( most noticeably hydrogen and helium ) which lead to a not obvious distribution of up- and down - quarks .",
    "therefore , we can anticipate that the current standard solar model combined with data coming from the next generation of the solar neutrino detections , will allow us to put much stronger constraints in the non - standard interactions of neutrinos .",
    "in the next section , we review the current status of the standard solar model and neutrino production in the sun s core , in section  [ sec - mnpo ] , we present a summarised discussion about the current standard neutrino oscillation flavour model , and a generalized model for which neutrinos have new types of interactions with standard particles . in section  [ sec - semns ] , we compute the neutrino spectra resulting from these new types of interactions . in the final section",
    "we discuss the results and their implications for the future neutrino experiments .",
    "( with @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is drawn as a function of the fractional radius @xmath17 for which @xmath18 is the flux in @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the total flux for this neutrino type .",
    "the neutrino sources noted with the symbol @xmath21 correspond to spectral lines .",
    "the same colour scheme is used in figures  [ figure:4 ] and  [ figure:5 ] . ]      during the last three decades helioseismology has provided solar physics with a tool that describes with unprecedented quality the internal structure of the sun from its surface up to the deepest layers of the sun s interior .",
    "this has allowed astronomers to characterise with great precision the different solar neutrino sources .",
    "equally , this discipline has stimulated the development of inversion techniques to probe the internal solar dynamics .",
    "today an impressive agreement has been reached between the neutrino flux predictions and the neutrino flux measurements made by the existing neutrino detectors .",
    "the high quality of the helioseismology data has allowed to compute an exceptionally accurate model of the sun s interior - the standard solar model .",
    "the neutrino fluxes predictions of the solar model have an accuracy comparable to the current measurements made by particle accelerators or nuclear reactors .    the standard solar model in this study",
    "is obtained using a version of the one - dimensional stellar evolution code cesam  @xcite .",
    "the code has an up - to - date and very refined microscopic physics ( updated equation of state , opacities , nuclear reactions rates , and an accurate treatment of the microscopic diffusion of heavy elements ) , including the solar mixture of  @xcite .",
    "this solar model is calibrated to reproduce with high accuracy the present total radius , luminosity and mass of the sun at the present @xmath22  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "this model is required to have a fixed value of the photospheric ratio @xmath23 , where x and z are the mass fraction of hydrogen and the mass fraction of elements heavier than helium .",
    "this solar standard model shows acoustic seismic diagnostics and solar neutrino fluxes similar to other models found in the literature   @xcite    this solar model is calibrated for the present day solar data with a high accuracy",
    ". therefore slightly different physical assumptions , will lead to different radial profiles of temperature , density and chemical composition , among other quantities .",
    "these changes result from readjustments of the sun s internal structure caused by the need to obtain the same total luminosity . in particular ,",
    "the neutrino fluxes and sound speed profile will be very sensitive to the radial distributions of the previous quantities .",
    "as such , using the high precision data from helioseismology , it is possible to put strong constraints to the internal structure of the sun and its neutrino fluxes  @xcite .    the current uncertainty between the square of the sound speed profile inferred from helioseismology acoustic data and the one obtained from the standard solar model using the up - to - date photospheric abundances  @xcite is smaller than 3% for any layer of the sun s interior .",
    "although there is a difference between the sound speed profile computed using an older mixture of abundances by  @xcite or the new mixture of  @xcite , for this study these effects are negligible on the radial variation of electrons , protons and neutrons .",
    "this is even more so , since recent measurements of the solar metallicity abundances suggest that the sound speed difference of helioseismic data and standard solar model is reduced further  @xcite .",
    "particularly relevant for our study is the radial profile of the electron , proton and neutron densities inside the sun , since these quantities are fundamental ingredients to test the non - standard neutrino physics theories .",

    "]      the neutrino fluxes produced in the nuclear reactions of the pp chains and cno cycle have been computed for an updated version of the solar standard model , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "figure  [ figure:1 ] shows the location of the different neutrino emission regions of the nuclear reactions for an up - to - date ssm . in the sun s core",
    ", the neutrino emission regions occur in a sequence of shells , following closely the location of nuclear reactions , orderly arranged in a sequence dependent on their temperature . the helioseismology data and solar neutrino fluxes guaranties that such neutrino shells are known with a great accuracy .",
    "the leading source of the energy in the present sun are the pp chains nuclear reactions , since the cno cycle nuclear reactions contribute with less than 2% .",
    "the first reaction of the pp chains is the @xmath4-@xmath6 reaction which has the largest neutrino emission shell , a region that extends from the centre to 0.30 @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath30-@xmath6 reaction has a neutrino emission shell which is similar to the @xmath4 reaction , but with a shell of 0.25 @xmath29 .",
    "these nuclear reactions are strongly dependent on the total luminosity of the star .",
    "alternatively , the neutrino emission shells of @xmath1-@xmath6 and @xmath31-@xmath6 extend up to 0.15 @xmath29 and 0.22@xmath29 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the maximum emission of neutrinos for the pp chains nuclear reactions , follows an ordered sequence ( see figure  [ figure:1 ] ) : @xmath1-@xmath6 , @xmath31-@xmath6 , @xmath30-@xmath32 and @xmath4-@xmath6 with the maximum emission located at 0.05 , 0.06 , 0.08 and 0.10 @xmath29 .",

    "accordingly , the density of up and down quarks will be computed from a relation analogous to @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 ) where @xmath40 is the mean molecular weight per quark given by @xmath41^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 with @xmath42 .",
    "the distribution of electrons and up and down quarks , as a function of the radius of the sun for the standard solar model , is shown in figure  [ figure:2 ] . the mean molecular weight per quark",

    "in the standard model , neutrinos interact with other particles only via weak standard interactions @xmath46 , which are described by the lagragian @xmath47 which can be decomposed into components describing the charged and neutral interactions  @xcite . nevertheless , in the current study",

    "all the different neutrino interaction models have several common features . in general",

    "it is only for neutrinos with intermediate energy that it is possible to distinguish between the different models ( cf .",
    "figure  [ figure:4 ] ) .",
    "for neutrinos in this energy interval it is possible to distinguish two effects : one relates with the location of the different neutrino sources , and a second effect relates with the parameter values ( @xmath217 ) of the neutrino interaction model . in the former effect , the @xmath216 differentiation results from the fact that @xmath213 are located at different solar radius , as shown in figure  [ figure:1 ] .",
    "such effect arises equally in @xmath202 and @xmath203 neutrino interaction models .",
    "the second effect occurs only for @xmath203 neutrino interaction models , and it is related with the radial distribution of up- and down - quarks ( cf .",
    "figure  [ figure:2 ] ) .    this latter effect is shown in figures  [ figure:4 ] and  [ figure:5 ] for the two fiducial models adopted in this study : a pure neutrino up - quark model ( @xmath218 ) and a pure neutrino down - quark model ( @xmath219 ) .",
    "accordingly , for neutrinos with an intermediate energy , the @xmath216 corresponding to the neutrino up - quark interaction model has an impact of larger amplitude than the neutrino down - quark interaction model ( compare middle and bottom panels in figure  [ figure:5 ] ) .",
    "for instance , this effect is very significant for the @xmath224 .",
    "nevertheless , these preliminary results should be interpreted with caution , since each neutrino source only produces neutrinos within a limited range of energy , as such the @xmath203effect of @xmath225 shown in figure  [ figure:5 ] can be significantly reduced in the final neutrino spectrum of some solar neutrino sources .",
    "indeed , we remind that the neutrinos emitted by @xmath211 are limited to a specific energy range for each @xmath226 nuclear reaction . as such only an energy portion of @xmath216 affects the final emitted neutrino spectrum .",
    "this point will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "the solar energy spectrum of electron neutrinos from any specific nuclear reaction is known to be essentially independent of solar parameters , that is , the energy spectrum created by a specific nuclear reaction is the same independently of whether neutrinos are produced in an earth laboratory or in the core of the sun .",
    "therefore , the neutrino energy spectrum of the different nuclear reactions , can be assumed to be equivalent to its earth laboratory counterpart .",
    "a typical example of such spectra is the @xmath7b neutrino energy spectrum emitted by the @xmath7b nuclear reaction of the pp chains in the sun s core .",
    "this solar neutrino spectrum has been shown to be equivalent to several experimental determinations of the @xmath7b neutrino spectrum  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , among others , have shown that the @xmath7b neutrino spectrum emitted in the sun s core is equal to the spectrum measured in the laboratory , as the surrounding solar plasma does not affect this type of nuclear reaction .",
    "the @xmath7b neutrino spectrum measured in the laboratory agrees remarkably well with its theoretical prediction for neutrinos with an energy below 12 mev , a small difference appearing only for high energy neutrinos .",
    "the experimental @xmath7b neutrino spectrum deduced from four laboratory experiments shows a difference with the theoretical prediction at most of 1%  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we will consider that the electron neutrino energy spectrum of a solar nuclear reaction at the specific location where these neutrinos are created is identical to the equivalent neutrino spectrum measured in the laboratory .",
    "all neutrinos produced in the sun s nuclear reactions are of electron neutrino type .",
    "it is only during the propagation phase that these neutrinos vary their flavour between electron , @xmath108 and @xmath107 .",
    "suitably , we define the original energy spectrum of electron neutrinos by @xmath227 and the end energy spectrum of neutrinos after the neutrino flavour oscillations by @xmath228 . the first spectrum , which is identical to the neutrino spectrum obtained in an earth s laboratory , relates to the neutrinos produced in nuclear reactions ( see figure  [ figure:1 ] ) .",
    "the latter spectrum corresponds to neutrinos that have their flavour modified by the vacuum oscillations and the generalized msw oscillation mechanism .",
    "conveniently , the neutrino spectra @xmath227 and @xmath228 associated to each of the different solar nuclear reactions of the @xmath229-chain and cno - cycle are labelled by an unique subscript @xmath212 which can take one of these values : @xmath4 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath5 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the two previous neutrino energy spectra have a simple relation , it reads @xmath230 where @xmath216 is the survival probability of an electron neutrino of energy @xmath231 . figure  [ figure:6 ] shows the shape of several neutrino spectra @xmath232 . the final neutrino energy spectrum @xmath232 is significantly different from the original spectrum @xmath233 .",
    "indeed , while @xmath233 depends only on the properties of the nuclear reaction , @xmath232 becomes distinct from @xmath233 due to the contribution of neutrino flavour oscillations .",
    "specifically , the @xmath232 depends on the fundamental parameters related with the neutrino vacuum oscillations through the ( generalized ) msw oscillation mechanism , which depends on the local densities of electrons and quarks , and the @xmath203 coupling constants  @xcite . as discussed previously ,",
    "all these effects are taken into account in @xmath215 ( equation  [ eq : pnuej ] ) . in this study",
    ", we do not include the mono - energetic spectral lines of pp chains nuclear reactions @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "although , the previous result ( equation  [ eq - psie ] ) also holds for these two neutrino sources ( corresponds to the sources marked with the subscript ( @xmath234 ) in figure  [ figure:1 ] ) , we opt for not including them in this study , since for these neutrino sources other solar plasma properties contribute to change the shape of the neutrino spectral lines .",
    "figure  [ figure:6 ] shows the spectra of electron neutrinos for some of the leading nuclear reactions of the sun s core .",
    "the general shape of the spectra @xmath232 ( equation  [ eq - psie ] ) is a combination of the neutrino spectrum of the nuclear reaction @xmath232 , and @xmath215 which depends of local density of electrons , down - quarks and up - quarks , as well as of the @xmath11- parameters of the generalized msw mechanism . for the specific set of @xmath11-parameters discussed in this study ,",
    "clearly the @xmath0 and @xmath1 neutrino emission shows the larger variation of the shape of their spectra .    in both cases",
    "the interaction of neutrinos with ( up- and down- ) quarks leads to neutrino spectra with quite distinct shapes ( blue and green areas in figure  [ figure:6 ] ) from the ones found in the standard msw neutrino interaction ( red area in figure  [ figure:6 ] ) . equally important is the fact that it is possible to distinguish between the two neutrino models of interaction with quarks , since each model depends differently of the neutrino energy .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 nuclear reactions also show neutrino spectra with different shapes , although in this case the impact of the @xmath203 interactions is much less pronounced than in the previous case , at least for the current set of parameters .",
    "for the two other nuclear reactions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the impact of the @xmath203 interactions is very small .",
    "this is somehow expected since the energy of the neutrinos emitted in these nuclear reactions is relatively small . for this neutrino energy range",
    "the flavour oscillations are dominated by vacuum oscillations and are almost independent of matter oscillations .",
    "is the electron solar neutrino spectrum for the standard msw effect ( red area ) with the error bar computed for the forthcoming lena experiment .",
    "the error ( black lines ) in the spectrum shape is computed assuming the error in the survival probability is @xmath235 , which corresponds to 5 years of the lena measurements .",
    "the coloured curves follow the same colour scheme shown in figure  [ figure:6 ] . for clarity",
    "we have not included the error bar in the two other curves .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the error bars for the other curves are identical to this one . ]",
    "in this study we have computed the expected alteration in the shape of some leading solar neutrino spectra resulting from neutrinos having a new type of interactions with up- and down - quarks , identical to the msw oscillations of neutrinos with electrons .",
    "this new type of matter interaction , also known as generalized msw oscillations , depends of the specific properties of the neutrino interaction model but also of the local thermodynamic properties of the sun s interior .",
    "the study shows that the neutrino spectra of the different solar nuclear reactions have quite distinct sensitivities to the new neutrino physics .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 neutrino spectra have their shapes more affected by the new interaction between neutrinos and quarks .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 neutrino spectra also have a small alteration to their shapes , but these effects are much less pronounced than in the previous case .",
    "the impact of new physics in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 spectra is also very small .    the new generation of neutrinos experiments such as low energy neutrino astronomy  ( lena , * ?",
    "* ) , jiangmen underground neutrino observatory  ( juno , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and no@xmath6a neutrino experiment  ( no@xmath6a , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will allow to test some of new neutrino physics theories .",
    "the most promising evidence to discover @xmath203 in solar neutrino data is the precise measurement of the @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "conveniently , we have estimated how the experimental error of the next generation of detectors like lena  @xcite could affect our conclusion . in figure  [ figure:7 ]",
    "is show an error bar estimation on the @xmath1 spectrum computed assuming the error in the survival probability is @xmath235 , which is the precision possible to be obtained for the electron neutrino survival probability after 5 years of lena measurements  @xcite . even in a relatively short period of 5 years of neutrino observations",
    ", it is already possible to find if neutrinos are experiencing flavour oscillations due to their interaction with quarks .",
    "indeed , the identification by a future solar neutrino detector of a strong distortion in the shape of the solar neutrino spectrum , like the @xmath1 neutrino spectrum compared to the one predicted by the standard solar model , will constitute a strong indication for the existence of interactions between neutrinos and quarks in the sun s core .",
    "the location and magnitude of the distortion of the solar spectrum should give us some indication about the type of interaction ( i.e. , up- and down - quarks or both ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that in the near future neutrino spectroscopic measurements will be used to infer the new interaction between neutrinos and quarks .",
