    "therefore , since @xmath187% , we require @xmath199  ppm ( @xmath200 of @xmath19_{\\odot}}$ ] ) for si / sio@xmath1 grains . in figure [ fig : pdlnt_dism_sisio2 ] we plot the temperature probability distribution functions for these grains , and ir emission spectra are shown in figure [ fig : emsn_dism_sisio2 ] .",
    "results are also summarized in table [ tab : rst ] .    evidently , the dirbe photometry rules out @xmath201  ppm in si / sio@xmath1 nanoparticles ( both neutral and charged ) with radii @xmath202 .",
    "the dirbe photometry places an upper limit @xmath203  ppm on the abundance of the @xmath204 particle size which appears to be required by the observed wavelength of peak emission in the diffuse ism .",
    "thus , we conclude that free - flying snps can account for no more than 13% of the observed ere from the diffuse ism .    sirtf will be able to obtain diffuse interstellar cloud emission spectra which should either detect the 16.4 or 20@xmath47 spectral features , or place much stronger constraints on the abundance of snps .",
    "si / sio@xmath1 core - mantle grains are heated primarily by absorption by the si core ( the photoluminescence of which is responsible for the ere ) , since the sio@xmath1 mantle is almost nonabsorptive for @xmath205 ; the core - mantle grains are cooled primarily by the sio@xmath1 mantle , since @xmath206 is so small for si in the infrared ( see figure [ fig : opct ] ) . therefore ,",
    "increasing the amount of sio@xmath1 present ( while holding the pure si cores constant ) will lead to only small changes in the ir emission resulting from the small decrease in average grain temperature ( e.g. , si / sio@xmath1 grains with equal numbers of si atoms in the core and in the mantle [ @xmath207 in ngc 2023 [ @xmath95=2000 ] have a steady - state temperature @xmath208k in comparison with @xmath20996k for grains with @xmath163 ) .",
    "the limits on @xmath4 will be only slightly affected by increasing the thickness of the sio@xmath1 mantles .    in  [ sec :",
    "results ] the grains are modelled as spherical . to investigate the sensitivity to shape variations , we have also calculated the ir emission spectra for ( 1 ) 5:1 prolate grains ; ( 2 ) 5:1 oblate grains ; ( 3 ) grains with a distribution of spheroidal shapes with @xmath210 ^ 2 $ ] ( ossenkopf , henning , & mathis 1992 ) where @xmath211 is the so - called `` depolarization factor '' parallel to the grain symmetry axis ( for spheres @xmath211=1/3 ) ; this shape distribution peaks at spheres and drops to zero for the extreme cases @xmath212 ( infinitely thin needles ) or @xmath213 ( infinitely flattened pancake ) . for core - mantle grains , we assume confocal geometry , with the above @xmath214 applying to the outer surface . for illustration , we present in figure [ fig : shape ] the ir spectra calculated for neutral si / sio@xmath1 grains illuminated by the ngc 2023 radiation field .",
    "it is clear that the shape effects are minor : the major change is a slight shift of the peak wavelength of the 20@xmath107 m si - o feature .    in a reflection nebula such as ngc 2023 , the ir surface brightness due to snps @xmath215 .",
    "while the fraction of the ir power radiated in the @xmath216 sio@xmath1 feature ( or the @xmath144 si feature in the case of pure si nanoparticles ) depends on @xmath95 ( through the grain temperature ) , this dependence is relatively weak for modest changes in @xmath95 .",
    "therefore the upper limits on the 16.4 and 20@xmath47 features in ngc 2023 give upper limits on @xmath217 ; these limits , plus the observed ere @xmath218 then give lower limits on @xmath4 , independent of the actual values of @xmath114 and @xmath219 , and only weakly dependent on the value of @xmath95 .",
    "one considerable uncertainty in our analysis concerns the uv absorption properties of nano - si material . in the literature",
    ", it is often stated that , as a result of quantum confinement , the optical - uv absorption of nano - si is substantially reduced in comparison with those of bulk - si . if this is true , the snp model would require an even larger si abundance to account for the ere , and the limitations placed on this model would be even more severe .",
    "another uncertainty concerns the ir emission properties of nano - si crystals and nano - sio@xmath1 , which have not yet been experimentally investigated . in the present work ,",
    "our results are mainly based on the ir emissivities of bulk si and bulk sio@xmath1 .",
    "nano - materials are expected to be more ir - active than their bulk counterparts ( due to the symmetry - breaking surfaces ) and therefore the detailed emission spectrum will be modified .",
    "however , the starlight energy absorbed by the grains has to be reradiated in the infrared , so the absence of detected spectral features implies upper limits on the snp abundance .",
    "our analysis of ngc 2023 required the value of the foreground extinction @xmath119 to `` deredden '' the ere measurements .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath119 has not been directly measured at the location where the ere observations have been made .",
    "it would be extremely valuable to have ere measurements made at a position where a reliable extinction has been determined  such as the emission bar 80@xmath56 s of hd 39037  or to have both ir and far - red observations of @xmath104 emission ( allowing @xmath119 to be determined ) at a location where the ere has been measured .",
    "our modelling has assumed isolated `` free - flying '' snps ; we have demonstrated that existing dirbe photometry for the diffuse ism rules out the hypothesis that the observed ere is due to such particles .",
    "since isolated snps are ruled out , it is important to note that in the laboratory , photoluminescence is observed for snps located on a substrate ( ledoux et al .",
    "an snp located on the surface of a large interstellar grain would have its temperature  and therefore its infrared emission  determined by the temperature of the `` host '' grain . in the case of ngc 2023 , the radiation field is so intense that the `` host '' temperature would probably be similar to the temperature of the si / sio@xmath1 snps , so the 20@xmath47 sio@xmath1 emission feature should still be prominent , though its strength could be increased or decreased , depending on the optical properties of the `` host '' grain .",
    "if the snps are pure si , however , the 16.4@xmath47 emissivity would be reduced if the snps are attached to a host , since the host grain would not be as hot as the si snps , which are poor thermal emitters . in the diffuse ism , the 16.4 and 20@xmath47 emission",
    "would be completely suppressed if the snps are attached to larger host grains , with temperatures @xmath220 .",
    "thus snps attached to larger host grains may be a viable explanation for the observed ere .",
    "the photoexcitation rate @xmath221 for snps on the surfaces of @xmath222 grains would probably be lower than for free - flying snps , which would in turn increase the abundance of si in snps required to explain the observed ere . since 42% or more of @xmath19_{\\odot}}$ ] is required even for free - flying snps",
    ", the si abundance demands would be difficult to accommodate if the snps are attached to @xmath222 grains .",
    ".ere emissivities of snps [ tab : rst ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +",
    "table [ tab : zsi ] summarizes our results for the abundances of snps : upper limits based on nondetection of 16.4 and 20@xmath47 features , and lower limits ( since @xmath223 ) if neutral snps are to account for the observed ere .",
    "note charged snps are not able to emit ere ( smith & witt 2001 ) .    for pure ( both neutral and charged ) si snps",
    ", nondetection of a 16.4@xmath107 m emission feature in ngc 2023 implies @xmath224 .",
    "thus for @xmath225 , pure neutral si snps could account for the observed ere in ngc 2023 provided @xmath226 , but if @xmath227 , @xmath228 would be required to account for the ere .",
    "we note in the laboratory high photoluminescence efficiencies are seen only when the si surfaces are `` passivated '' by an oxide coating .",
    "an oxide coating , however , will introduce a strong emission feature at 20@xmath107 m which is not seen in ngc 2023 . for si",
    "/ sio@xmath1 nanoparticles to explain the ere , nondetection of the 20@xmath107 m feature requires a luminescence efficiency @xmath229 .",
    "photoluminescence efficiencies as high as 50% have been reported for si / sio@xmath1 nanoparticles ( wilson , szajowski , & brus 1993 ) , and in principle @xmath4 could approach 100% . however ,",
    "if @xmath230 , the ere could not be due to si / sio@xmath1 nanoparticles since the required @xmath4 would then exceed 100% .",
    "the ere emissivity of the diffuse ism ( gordon et al .  1998 ; szomoru & guhathakurta 1998 ) requires @xmath231_{\\odot}}$ ] in neutral si / sio@xmath1 snps , even for photoluminescence efficiency @xmath232 .",
    "such a high abundance of snps in the diffuse ism is difficult to reconcile with the evidence that a substantial fraction of interstellar si is in fact locked up in amorphous silicate grains ( e.g. , see weingartner & draine 2001 ) .",
    "this difficulty is exacerbated if interstellar abundances are significantly subsolar , as has been argued ( see snow & witt 1996 ) .",
    "we have calculated the ir emission which such particles would produce if they are free - flying . existing dirbe 25@xmath47 photometry appears to already rule out such high abundances of snps , indicating that if snps are responsible for the ere from the diffuse ism , they must either be in @xmath233 clusters , or attached to larger `` host '' grains .",
    "future observations by sirtf will be even more sensitive to the abundance of free - flying snps in the diffuse interstellar medium .    in light of the controversy over the optical properties of nano - si material , we call for further experimental studies to determine the dielectric functions of nano - si material either directly from nano - si crystals , or from porous - si with the effects of voids and surface oxidation well determined and removed .",
    "finally , we also note that , if the surface dangling bonds of si grains are passivated by h atoms and if they are present in interstellar space in quantities sufficient to account for the observed ere , we would expect to see the si - h 15.6@xmath107 m wagging , 11.6@xmath107 m bending , and even 5@xmath107 m stretching bands ( adachi 1999 ) .",
