    "solid state systems are now attracting much attention as potential components for quantum computers , in part because of their potential scalability , and because the parameters of a solid state qubit can be engineered with considerable freedom .",
    "this freedom allows one to add different building blocks to the quantum computer , each block bringing the design closer to satisfying the criteria required for quantum computation ( qc ) @xcite and , in particular , enabling universal qc according to the ( non fault - tolerant ) `` standard paradigm '' @xcite . in this standard paradigm ,",
    "all single - qubit operations [ generating @xmath4 plus an entangling two - qubit operation ( e.g. , controlled - not , denoted cnot ) are necessary to achieve universal quantum computation .",
    "alternatively , one can use a discrete set of single - qubit operations ( e.g. , hadamard and @xmath5 ) together with cnot in order to approximate to arbitrary accuracy any quantum circuit @xcite , a method that is compatible with fault - tolerant quantum error correction @xcite . while the different building blocks help in reaching universality , each one comes with its fabrication difficulties and adds a potential source of noise and decoherence to the system .",
    "it was realized recently that some of these building blocks can be replaced by ` software ' means @xcite .",
    "more specifically , by encoding a logical qubit into a few physical qubits , the design of the quantum computer can be simplified without compromising universality .",
    "this approach is known as encoded universality @xcite .",
    "e.g. , it is possible to remove difficult - to - implement single - qubit operations @xcite .",
    "this simplification has the advantages of facilitating fabrication and reducing some sources of decoherence and noise .",
    "interesting alternatives to encoding that also aim to reduce design constraints , some by replacing logic gates with measurements , were recently presented in @xcite .",
    "studies of simplifying encodings have so far been performed primarily for exchange - type hamiltonians in spin - coupled solid state quantum computer designs @xcite , and in nmr @xcite . here",
    "we extend this study to superconducting phase qubits .",
    "superconducting phase qubits are among the leading solid state qubit candidates , in part due to recent experimental progress @xcite .",
    "several designs of phase qubits have been suggested in the literature ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . in this work ,",
    "we first focus on the d - wave grain boundary qubits @xcite and recall the relevant system hamiltonian .",
    "a simplification of the design suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite will yield a system hamiltonian which is not versatile enough to be universal , according to the standard paradigm @xcite , because it lacks certain single - qubit operations .",
    "we will show how universality can be recovered by using a simple encoding and recoupling techniques .",
    "the encoding will suggest the use of a `` bus qubit '' , a concept that could be useful for other quantum computer designs .",
    "in particular , we explore the possibility of using these concepts with the other superconducting phase qubit designs .",
    "finally , application of the dynamical decoupling technique to decoherence reduction will be examined .",
    "the d - wave grain boundary qubit ( dgb qubit ) , figure  [ fig_gbqb ] , has the following system hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 and where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are the pauli matrices . in this system , coherent tunneling of the phase",
    "is only possible when the energy levels are in resonance . as a result",
    ", when a bias or josephson coupling is turned on , the tunneling matrix element(s ) @xmath12 for the corresponding qubit(s ) is exponentially suppressed .",
    "we therefore take _ only one _ of the terms ( [ h_x ] ) , ( [ h_z ] ) or ( [ h_zz ] ) to be on at any given time .    moreover , for the dgb qubit , turning on the bias or josephson coupling is the only way to control the value of the tunneling matrix element .",
    "the latter can then effectively only be turned on or off , without continuous control over its magnitude .",
    "this magnitude is determined at fabrication time by the asymmetry between the d - wave superconductors forming the qubit and by the width of the junction @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that by connecting an external capacitor to the qubit circuit , the magnitude of @xmath13 could be controlled independently @xcite .",
    "however , this design complicates fabrication and connects the qubit to another potential source of decoherence .",
    "since the tunneling matrix elements depend exponentially on their parameters , small noise on these parameters can have dramatic effect on the coherence of the system . in this paper , we are interested in simplifying fabrication demands on the design and reducing sources of decoherence , hence this possibility will not be considered further .",
    "we now come to our main simplification : _ in this work we reduce the constraints on fabrication by removing the possibility of applying bias @xmath14 on individual qubits_. this bias requires , e.g. , the possibility of applying a local magnetic field on each qubit , and is experimentally very challenging to realize .",
    "we do retain the josephson couplings @xmath15 between the qubits , as these are necessary to produce entanglement .",
    "these couplings are realized by connecting pairs of qubits by a superconducting single electron transistor ( sset ) @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath16 can , to some extent , be tuned continuously by the sset s gate voltage .",
    "the sign of this energy could be changed by inserting a strong @xmath17-junction .",
    "again , with simplification of design in mind , the sign of @xmath15 will hereafter be considered fixed .",
    "the effective system hamiltonian that we consider in this paper is therefore : @xmath18 where we have _ continuous _ control over @xmath15 . as mentioned above , when the josephson coupling @xmath15 is non - zero , the corresponding matrix elements necessarily vanish : @xmath19 . in the idle state ,",
    "@xmath20 is non - zero and the qubit undergoes coherent tunneling .",
    "we proceed to show how universal qc can be performed given the outlined constraints .    , a@xmath21 and b are d - wave superconductors , pk ( parity key ) represent the ssets , @xmath22 is the mismatch angle between the lattices of a@xmath23 and b. positive lobes of the d - wave order parameter are shaded .",

    "@xcite , it was shown how to perform universal quantum computation on the dgb qubit in the case where individual control of the bias @xmath24 is possible . here",
    ", we do not allow for this possibility and , since @xmath25 and @xmath26 are insufficient for universal qc on the physical qubits , the techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite will have to be supplemented .",
    "this is achieved by encoding a pair of physical qubits as one logical qubit in the following way :    @xmath27    for the @xmath28 logical qubit with @xmath29 and where there are a total of @xmath0 physical qubits .",
    "it is easy to check that any other encoding into two qubits is not preserved under @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath31 terms are allowed to act then the encoding of eq .",
    "( [ eq : encoding ] ) is not preserved either .",
    "we address this issue below .",
    "initialization of each encoded qubit can be done by measurement .",
    "this will project on the physical qubit s computational basis . hence measuring",
    "the @xmath32 physical qubit will yield either @xmath33 or @xmath34 physical qubit will have to be repeated until the outcome @xmath35 is obtained .",
    "since tunneling will cause bit - flips immediately following the measurement , a good strategy is to simultaneously measure both these physical qubits , and repeat the measurement of the @xmath36 physical qubit ( projecting on the computational basis every time ) until that of the @xmath37 physical qubit has converged on @xmath38 .",
    "alternatively , initialization can be performed by field - cooling the qubits . by choosing the proper orientation for the external field",
    ", all physical qubits can be prepared in the @xmath39 state and , therefore , all logical qubits in the @xmath40 state .",
    "this strategy will most probably not be of practical use during computation but can serve to provide an initial supply of fresh qubits . for the dgb qubits , a current in terminal b can also be used to initialize all qubits to the @xmath40 state @xcite .",

    "only odd - numbered physical qubits are involved in this gate .",
    "we now have all the ingredients for universal qc . however , there are some subtleties and potential simplifications , to which we now turn .",

    "if we replace the @xmath58 qubit by a fixed bus qubit @xmath59 then the only change necessary is @xmath60 .",
    "i.e. , we need to be able to turn on / off a josephson coupling between all odd - numbered qubits and the bus qubit .",

    "`` encoded decoupling '' ( i.e. , acting on encoded qubits ) of the type we discuss below has been previously suggested for solid - state @xcite and nmr @xcite qc proposals .",

    "@xcite , but access to single - qubit @xmath183 operations was assumed .",
    "we extend and generalize this discussion here .",
    "the total hamiltonian of a qubit system ( @xmath226 ) and bath ( @xmath62 ) can be written as @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the system - bath coupling . in order to use the bb method",
    "one makes two assumptions : first , ( as in the threshold result of fault tolerant qc @xcite ) that a controllable part of @xmath229 can be made so strong that we can make @xmath230 approximate that part of @xmath229 to arbitrary precision .",
    "this is needed so that @xmath228 can be neglected during the pulse .",
    "second , that one can pulse this controllable part of @xmath229 with a pulse repetition time that is much shorter than the inverse of the bath frequency cutoff .",
    "this requirement arises since in between bb pulses the bath should not change , or else it will acquire phases that , when the bath is traced over , will result in decoherence in the system @xcite .",
    "we will take the interaction term to have the linear form @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is the vector of pauli matrices acting on the system , and @xmath233 are corresponding bath operators .",
    "this can represent the interaction of a qubit with a fluctuating control field .",
    "for example , for the superconducting phase qubit , a term @xmath234 arises due to fluctuation of local magnetic field .",
    "the relation of @xmath228 to the parameters of the system and bath can be analyzed in detail @xcite .",
    "our approach to decoherence suppression depends on the time - scales that emerge from this analysis , and on the symmetry of the system - bath interaction .",
    "suppose that @xmath235 so that the strong parts of @xmath229 are @xmath236 which we can turn on and off freely .",
    "if @xmath228 is of the general form @xmath237 , then @xmath238 obviously is not enough to eliminate @xmath228 by decoupling methods , since it commutes with the @xmath239 terms .",

    "there will be an error proportional to the ratio of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath228 by the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath229 .",
    "the important point is that this type of axially symmetric system - bath interaction can be suppressed _ without any extra resources _ , simply by using the already available josephson coupling .",

    "( [ eq : axsym ] ) commutes with all @xmath244 , @xmath245 and with all @xmath246 such that @xmath247 .",
    "all these logical operations can therefore be executed in parallel with this decoupling procedure . however , since the decoupling pulses anticommute with @xmath248 this logical operation is eliminated if it is turned on during decoupling .",
    "hence we must alternate suppressing decoherence on the @xmath249 qubit and performing logical @xmath162 operations on it .",
    "this implies that this qubit will suffer some decoherence while @xmath248 is applied to it , unless we protect it by other means , such as active quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath250 and @xmath251 on and off , and while we do so @xmath228 becomes negligible .",
    "the only effect of @xmath228 is to decohere the qubit system when it evolves freely , i.e. , under @xmath252 .",
    "now suppose the system - bath interaction has a symmetry so that @xmath253 note that , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) , a term of the form @xmath254 can be rotated to @xmath255 : @xmath256 = \\exp \\left ( i\\theta \\sigma ^{y}\\right ) .\\ ] ] hence @xmath257 = \\\\",

    "again , there is the implicit assumption that during the on - time of the tunneling and josephson operations @xmath228 is negligible .",
    "regarding computation , similar comments as in the previous subsection apply , i.e. , those logical operations that commute with the decoupling pulses can be turned on simultaneously with the latter , while those that anticommute can not .",
    "however , the cases @xmath263 and @xmath264 can not be dealt with using this decoupling method , given the available interactions . to treat these cases we must introduce an additional short - time assumption , which may or may not be more severe than the usual bb assumption .",
    "suppose again that @xmath265 .",
    "unlike the previous cases , where there was a symmetry in @xmath228 , we now have to resort to a small time approximation in order to expand the time evolution .",
    "namely @xmath266 to see how this is useful , assume that we leave the system - bath interaction on for a short time , so that : @xmath267 which can be partly decoupled using the josephson interaction . first : @xmath268 = \\\\ e^{i\\sigma _ { i}^{x}b_{i}^{x}t / n } e^{i\\sigma _ { i}^{y}b_{i}^{y}t / n } e^{-i\\sigma _ { i}^{z}b_{i}^{z}t / n}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore :    @xmath269 = \\\\ e^{-i\\sum_{i}\\sigma _ { i}^{z}b_{i}^{z}t / n}+o(n^{-2 } ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the remaining term can be decoupled using the tunneling hamiltonian : @xmath270 = i+o(\\frac{1}{n^2}).\\ ] ] this procedure requires pulses that are short not only on the time scale of the bath inverse frequency cutoff ( for the bb procedure ) , but also on the time scale of the system - bath interaction [ in order to justify the expansion of the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) ] .",
    "we see once more that some decoherence reduction can be performed without using more resources than is required for computation .",
    "by encoding two physical qubits into one logical qubit , or three physical qubits into two logical qubits , we have shown how some of the building blocks that have so far been considered indispensable in superconducting phase - qubit quantum computers , can in fact be eliminated . moreover , by grouping the code s ancilla qubits into a single `` bus qubit '' , we were able to further simplify the engineering constraints on the fabrication of this important class of solid - state qubits .",
    "an important additional advantage of the encoding is that it allows one to eliminate potential external sources of noise and decoherence .",
