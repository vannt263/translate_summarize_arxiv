    "extra gauge bosons , both charged ( @xmath1 ) and/or neutral ( @xmath3 ) , arise in many models of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "examples include extended gauge theories such as grand unified theories @xcite and left - right symmetric models @xcite along with the corresponding supersymmetric models , and other models such as those with finite size extra dimensions @xcite . to elucidate what physics lies beyond the standard model it is necessary to search for manifestations of that new physics with respect to the predicted particle content .",
    "such searches are a feature of ongoing collider experiments and the focus of future experiments .",
    "the discovery of new particles would provide definitive evidence for physics beyond the standard model and , in particular , the discovery of new gauge bosons would indicate that the standard model gauge group was in need of extension .",
    "there is a considerable literature on @xmath3 searches . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on @xmath1 searches , for which less work has been done .",
    "limits have been placed on the existence of new gauge bosons through indirect searches based on the deviations from the sm they would produce in precision electroweak measurements . for instance , indirect limits from @xmath4-decay constrain the left - right model @xmath1 to @xmath5 gev @xcite . a more severe constraint",
    "arises from @xmath6 mass - splitting which gives @xmath7  tev @xcite , assuming equal coupling constants for the two @xmath8 gauge groups .",
    "new gauge boson searches at hadron colliders consider their direct production via the drell - yan process and their subsequent decay to lepton pairs . for @xmath1 bosons ,",
    "decays to hadronic jets are sometimes also considered .",
    "the present bounds on @xmath1 bosons from the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron @xmath9 collider at fermilab are @xmath10  gev @xcite .",
    "the search reach is expected to increase by @xmath11  gev with 1  fb@xmath12 of luminosity @xcite .",
    "the large hadron collider is expected to be able to discover @xmath1 s up to masses of @xmath13  tev @xcite .",
    "these @xmath1 limits assume sm strength couplings and decay into a light stable neutrino which is registered in the detector as missing @xmath14 .",
    "they can be seriously degraded by loosening the model assumptions .",
    "there are few studies of indirect searches for @xmath1 bosons at @xmath15 colliders . in a recent paper we examined the sensitivity of the reaction @xmath16 to @xmath1 and @xmath3 bosons@xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we found it was sensitive to @xmath1 s up to several tev in mass , depending on the model , the centre of mass energy , and the integrated luminosity .    clearly",
    ", if deviations from the standard model are observed , it will take many different measurements to disentangle the nature of the new physics responsible . in this paper",
    "we present the results of a study of the sensitivity of the process @xmath17 to @xmath1 bosons .",
    "we find that this process is sensitive to @xmath1 masses up to several tev , in many cases more sensitive than the process @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , we find that it is far more sensitive to the un - unified model ( uum ) @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath19 is sensitive to both the quark and lepton couplings to the @xmath1 and , furthermore , does not have the complication of contributions from @xmath3 bosons .",
    "it can therefore contribute information that complements that obtained from @xmath16 , helping to build a picture of the underlying physics .",
    "we consider various extended electroweak models .",
    "the first is the left - right symmetric model @xcite based on the gauge group @xmath20 which has right - handed charged currents .",
    "the second is the un - unified model @xcite which is based on the gauge group @xmath21 where the quarks and leptons each transform under their own @xmath8 .",
    "the final type of model , denoted as the kk model , contains the kaluza - klein excitations of the sm gauge bosons which are a possible consequence of theories with large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "we give the relevant couplings for those models in section ii but refer the reader to the literature for more details .",
    "additionally , we study discovery limits for a @xmath1 boson with sm couplings .",
    "although it is not a realistic model , this so - called sequential standard model ( ssm ) has been adopted as a benchmark to compare the discovery reach of different processes .",
    "we will find that the process @xmath19 can indeed extend the discovery reach for @xmath1 s significantly beyond @xmath22 , with the exact limit depending on the specific model .",
    "additionally , if extra gauge bosons are discovered which are not overly massive , the process considered here could be used to measure their couplings .",
    "this would be crucial for determining the origins of the @xmath1 .",
    "as such , it would play an important complementary role to the lhc studies .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the details of our calculations .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 discovery limits and projected sensitivities for @xmath1 couplings are given in section iii .",
    "we conclude with some final comments .",
    "we are interested in the process @xmath23 where the photon arises from either a backscattered laser @xcite or from weizs@xmath24ker williams bremsstrahlung @xcite from the incident @xmath25 beam .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams are given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this process",
    "it is diagrams 1(a ) and 1(b ) with the @xmath1 exchanged in the t - channel which are most sensitive to the effects of the @xmath1 .",
    "the contribution of these diagrams can be enhanced by imposing the kinematic cut that one of either the @xmath26 or the @xmath27 is collinear to the beam axis . in this kinematic region",
    "the process @xmath28 is approximated quite well by the simpler process @xmath29 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the quark is described by the quark parton content of the photon , the so - called resolved photon approximation @xcite .",
    "this has been verified numerically by comparing kinematic distributions of the outgoing quark calculated using both process [ process1 ] and process [ process2 ] for a given detector acceptance where the outgoing @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is constrained to @xmath30 and in addition for process [ process1 ] @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 ) , i.e.  in process 1 , one jet is observed while the other is lost down the beam pipe .",
    "we use the process @xmath33 to obtain limits as it is computationally much faster and the discovery limits obtained using this approximation are in good agreement with those using the full process .",
    "the reliability of the limits have been further checked by using different photon distribution functions .",
    "the expression for the unpolarized cross section is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the photon distribution , @xmath36 the distribution for the quark content in the photon , and @xmath37 is the cross section for the parton level process given by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 } \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the usual mandelstam variables for the parton level process .",
    "we take @xmath44 in @xmath45 and the scale @xmath46 in @xmath47 is only relevant for photons produced via the weizs@xmath2cker williams process .",
    "the process @xmath48 also contributes to the same experimental signature .",
    "its cross section is given by eq .",
    "[ dsdt ] but with @xmath41 and @xmath43 interchanged in eq .",
    "[ fsu ] such that @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , for the processes @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which contribute in the case the of the weizs@xmath2cker williams process , the cross section is given with @xmath52 and @xmath53 in eq .",
    "[ fsu ] respectively .",
    "our conventions for the couplings , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , follow from the vertices @xmath56 thus , in the sm , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "a @xmath1 in the ssm also has these sm couplings . in the case of the kk model ,",
    "the couplings are enhanced by a factor of @xmath59 such that @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . in the lrm",
    ", the extra @xmath62 has only right - handed couplings such that @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . here",
    "the parameter @xmath65 is the ratio of the coupling constants of the two @xmath8 gauge groups . since we will ultimately find that the process under consideration here is not as sensitive to a @xmath62 as some other processes",
    ", we will only consider the lr model for @xmath66 .",
    "we also take the ckm matrix elements for right - handed fermions to be equal to those of left - handed fermions . in each of the models mentioned so far , the couplings of the @xmath1 to the quarks and the leptons are equal . in the case of the uum",
    ", we have instead @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "the uum is parametrized by an angle @xmath70 , which represents the mixing of the charged gauge bosons of the two @xmath8 groups .",
    "the process we consider is actually insensitive to the parameter @xmath70 because @xmath71 and @xmath72 always multiply each other in the expressions for the cross section .",
    "the polarized cross sections may be inferred from the coupling structure in eq .",
    "( [ fsu ] ) .",
    "we begin by showing and discussing the total cross sections and the differential cross sections @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we do not show the angular distribution as it gives lower limits than do the @xmath75 and @xmath76 distributions .",
    "we take the sm inputs @xmath77 gev , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 @xcite . since we work only to leading order",
    ", there is some arbitrariness in the above input , in particular @xmath80 .    to take into account detector acceptance , the angle of the observed jet , @xmath81 , has been restricted to the range @xmath82 in extracting limits we will also restrict the jet s transverse momentum to reduce hadronic backgrounds which we discuss below .",
    "the unpolarized cross sections , @xmath83 , for photons coming from the backscattered laser photon distribution and the weizs@xmath2cker williams distributions are shown in fig .",
    "we have included @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87-quark contributions and used the leading order grv distributions in calculating these cross sections @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the use of other parametrizations below .",
    "for the case of the backscattered photon we included the subprocesses @xmath88 and @xmath89 where the @xmath26 could be either @xmath84 or @xmath87 and the @xmath27 could be a @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",
    "for the weizs@xmath2cker williams case the photon can be radiated from either the @xmath92 or @xmath93 so we must also include the subprocesses @xmath51 and @xmath94 .",
    "the cross section is shown for the sm , lrm ( @xmath95 ) , uum , ssm , and kk model , with @xmath96 gev in each case .",
    "the mass choice is rather arbitrary , made to illustrate general behaviour .",
    "we do not show cross sections for polarized electrons .",
    "the cross section for right handed electrons ( @xmath97 ) only couples to @xmath1 s in the lr model . in all other cases considered here , @xmath98 is zero .",
    "one first notes that the cross sections for the backscattered laser case are somewhat larger than those for the @xmath15 case with ww photons .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the harder photon spectrum in the case of the former .",
    "the cross sections are typically of the order of several picobarns . for the luminosities expected at high energy @xmath15 colliders",
    "this results in statistical errors of less than a percent . with systematic errors expected to be of the order of 2%",
    "we therefore expect systematic errors to dominate over statistical errors . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] one also sees that , at least for the example shown , the deviations due to a @xmath1 are significantly larger than the expected measurement error .",
    "thus , it appears that this process will provide a sensitive probe for @xmath1 bosons .",
    "we are interested in reactions in which only the quark ( or antiquark ) jet is observed .",
    "the kinematic observables of interest are therefore , the jet s energy , @xmath75 , its momentum perpendicular to the beam axis , @xmath76 , and its angle relative to the incident electron , @xmath99 , all defined in the @xmath15 center - of - mass frame .",
    "the differential cross sections , @xmath74 and @xmath73 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the standard model and the ssm , lrm , uum , and kk models for the backscattered laser case with @xmath100 gev and @xmath96  gev .",
    "we do not show the angular distribution as we found that the @xmath74 and @xmath73 distributions were more sensitive to @xmath1 s .",
    "we see that extra @xmath101 bosons result in larger _ relative _ deviations from the sm in the high @xmath75 or @xmath76 regions but since the lower @xmath75 or @xmath76 regions have higher statistics the result is roughly similar in significance in both kinematic regions although the high @xmath76 ( @xmath75 ) region will be less affected by systematic error . to maximize the potential information we divide the distributions into 10 equal sized bins and calculate the @xmath102 by summing over the bins .    before proceeding to our results",
    "we must deal with the issue of backgrounds .",
    "the dominant backgrounds arise from two jet final states where one of the jets goes down the beam pipe and is not observed .",
    "processes which contribute two jet final states are : @xmath103 , the once resolved reactions @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and the twice resolved reactions @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 ... @xcite .",
    "in addition there are backgrounds involving t - channel exchange of massive gauge bosons but these are suppressed relative to the backgrounds already listed . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the @xmath76 distributions for these backgrounds with only one of the jets observed and the other going down the beam pipe for @xmath109  gev for the backscattered laser case .",
    "we use the criteria that , to be seen , the parton must satisfy @xmath110 .",
    "it is likely that these cuts would be more stringent in a real detector and with veto detectors close to the beam pipe .",
    "however , other issues such as spread of the hadronic jets and the remnants of the photon complicate the analysis and must be carefully considered . in the absence of a detailed detector simulation",
    "we feel that the chosen detector cuts will give a reasonable representation of the situation for the purposes of estimating the discovery potential of this process .",
    "to extract limits from real data these effects must , of course , be studied in detail . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the constraint that @xmath111  gev effectively eliminates these backgrounds .",
    "similarly , for @xmath112  tev we take @xmath113  gev and for @xmath114  tev we take @xmath115  gev .",
    "the best discovery limits were in general obtained using the observable @xmath116 with @xmath117 being only slightly less sensitive .",
    "we found that limits obtained using other observables such as the total cross section , forward backward asymmetry and @xmath118 were less sensitive so the results we present will be based on the @xmath76 distributions .",
    "in addition , for the backscattered laser case limits were obtained for the lr model using the right - handed polarized cross section , @xmath98 and the left - right asymmetry , @xmath119 for 100% polarization and only including statistical errors one obtains reasonable limits for the lrm @xmath1 . however , for more realistic polarizations of 90% these limits are seriously degraded and only slightly greater than those obtained from unpolarized @xmath76 and @xmath75 distributions . once systematic errors are included , even though they were only one half those used in the @xmath116 calculation ( since one expects some cancellation of errors between the numerator and denominator in @xmath120 ) , we find that the sensitivity of @xmath120 is less than those obtained from the @xmath76 and @xmath75 distributions while the sensitivity of @xmath98 is roughly comparable to the sensitivity of the distributions .",
    "we therefore only report limits obtained from the distributions in tables i and ii .    in obtaining the @xmath102 for @xmath116 , we used 10 equal sized bins in the range @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is given by the @xmath76 cut chosen to reduce the two jet backgrounds and @xmath123 is taken to be the kinematic limit .",
    "we have @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the error on the measurement .",
    "analogous formulae hold for other observables .",
    "one sided 95% confidence level discovery limits are obtained by requiring @xmath126 for discovery .",
    "systematic errors , when included , were added in quadrature with the statistical errors .",
    "the discovery limits for all five models are listed in table  [ limitstabbl ] for the backscattered laser case and in table  [ limitstabww ] for the @xmath15 case with ww photons .",
    "results are presented for @xmath127 , 1.0 and 1.5 tev , using the same input parameters as for the cross sections presented in the previous section .",
    "for each center - of - mass energy , two luminosity scenarios are considered and we present limits obtained with and without systematic errors .",
    "our prescription is to include a 2% systematic error per bin .",
    "this number is quite arbitrary but seems reasonable .",
    "in addition to detector systematics , which we expect will dominate , there are uncertainties associated with the beam luminosity and energy , which will be spread over a range .",
    "other systematic errors are associated with background subtraction as well as radiative corrections .",
    "thus , the 2% number should not be taken too seriously except to highlight the fact that a precision measurement is required to take full advantage of the large event rate .",
    "the discovery limits are substantial and compare favourably in most cases to those obtained from the previously studied process @xmath128 .",
    "in all cases , the limits for the ww process are significantly lower than with the backscattered laser .",
    "this enhanced reach is an argument in favour of @xmath129 colliders . as expected ,",
    "when systematic errors are not included there is a significant improvement in the limits with the higher luminosity .",
    "when 2% systematic errors are included the improvement for the high luminosity scenario is not as dramatic .    in every case for the process considered here , the ssm and uum yield the same discovery limits",
    "this occurs because the two processes represent positive and negative interferences of equal strength , respectively , with the sm .",
    "the limits obtained here for the backscattered laser case for the ssm are similar to those from the process @xmath128 before a systematic error is included . however , the limits here are downgraded less than for the previous process when a 2% systematic error is included , resulting in a higher discovery reach for this process .",
    "the behaviour is similar for the lrm .",
    "the limits , for the backscattered laser case , including systematic errors , are similar to those obtained for @xmath130 .    for both the kk model and the uum",
    ", this process offers a significant improvement over the process @xmath131 .",
    "for the backscattered laser case , the kk @xmath1 limits are typically 2 times higher when a systematic error is included than for the previous process .",
    "similarly , the limits obtained for the uum with the process considered here are a factor of 3 better than for the equivalent case in the previous process .    beam polarization of 90% does not improve the limits .",
    "the only model studied which would benefit from polarization is the lrm for which the @xmath1 is right - handed .",
    "the process @xmath132 proceeds via t - channel @xmath101-exchange .",
    "the sm contribution is totally left - handed so that for 100% right - handed polarization a @xmath62 would show up quite dramatically .",
    "however , the cross - section for @xmath62 s which are not unrealistically light is orders of magnitude smaller than the left - handed cross section .",
    "so even a small pollution of left - handed electrons would largely overwhelm the right - handed cross section .",
    "the signal from right - handed @xmath1 s is further eroded when systematic errors are included .",
    "quantitatively we found for the back scattered laser case with @xmath109  gev and @xmath133  fb@xmath12 using 100% right - handed electrons a discovery limit of 1.7  tev .",
    "this was degraded to @xmath134  gev when 90% polarization was used and was further degraded to @xmath135  gev when a 2% systematic error on the cross section was included .",
    "this is only slightly higher than what is obtained using the @xmath76 distribution with unpolarized electrons .",
    "the uum is an interesting case .",
    "first , as noted above , the process @xmath136 is considerably more sensitive to a uum @xmath1 than the process studied previously , @xmath131 . in addition",
    ", the dependence on the mixing angle between the two @xmath8 groups cancels in the process we are studying",
    ". the cross section exhibits a straightforward destructive interference of the @xmath1 exchange with the sm @xmath101 exchange , rather than the complicated @xmath70 dependence of the process @xmath131 .",
    "this is an example of how the two processes complement each other .",
    "as indicated above , we also derived discovery limits using another parametrization of the photon distribution functions , that of schuler and sjstrand @xcite .",
    "that particular distribution results in lower cross sections than does the grv parametrization . however , the discovery limits were consistently within 50 - 100  gev of those reported in the tables .      in this section ,",
    "we consider constraints on the couplings of an extra @xmath1 from the process @xmath17 .",
    "all constraints are shown for the backscattered laser case .",
    "these constraints are significant only in the case where the mass of the corresponding extra gauge boson is considerably lower than its search limit in this process .",
    "we assume here that a signal for an extra gauge boson has been detected by another experiment , such as at the lhc .",
    "given such a signal , we derive constraints ( at 95% c.l . ) on the couplings of extra gauge bosons .",
    "we present the constraints in terms of couplings @xmath54 and @xmath55 which are normalized as in eq .",
    "[ wcoup ]    the constraints correspond to @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the prediction for the observable @xmath139 in the sm , @xmath140 is the prediction of the extension of the sm and @xmath141 is the expected experimental error .",
    "the index @xmath142 corresponds to different observables such as @xmath83 , @xmath98 , @xmath120 , or @xmath116 where one sums over all bins as in eq .",
    "[ sumbin ] for the latter .",
    "we examined the sensitivity to polarized beams with the assumption that for single beam ( @xmath92 ) polarization , we have , as in the previous section , equal running in left and right polarization states .",
    "we found , as before , that polarized beams with realistic polarization , offer little improvement over the case of unpolarized beams .    in figs .",
    "[ fig6]-[fig9 ] we present our constraints on @xmath1 couplings .",
    "the sm corresponds to the origin and we vary the @xmath1 couplings about it , showing the contours corresponding to a 95% cl deviation .",
    "thus , @xmath1 couplings lying within the limits would be indistinguishable from the sm while those outside would indicate statistically significant deviations from the sm . for simplicity",
    "we have taken @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "this assumption is satisfied for the ssm , the lrm and the kk model .",
    "we indicate the couplings corresponding to those three models with a full star , a dot , and an open star , respectively . if one were making simultaneous measurements with different processes one could extract lepton couplings from one measurement and then use those as input to constrain the quark couplings with this process .",
    "we also point out that the couplings are normalized differently here than in ref.@xcite . for comparison ,",

    "these limits compare very favourably with other processes , including measurements at the lhc . for the @xmath15 process with ww photons ,",
