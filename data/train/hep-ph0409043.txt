    "there have been many experimental results in neutrino physics @xcite which have established the pattern of neutrino oscillation and masses , clearly requiring physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) to explain it . in general",
    ", neutrino oscillations are parametrized by three mixing angles , with two of them large , as opposed to the quark sector where the mixing angles are all small .",
    "moreover , neutrino oscillations depend also on the mass squared differences , and we have learned that the mass difference corresponding to the atmospheric neutrino oscillations is much larger than the corresponding one to the solar neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the solar neutrinos leads to the @xmath1 level limits @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath2 while the atmospheric neutrino data shows that @xmath3    despite the lack of direct experimental evidence on supersymmetry ( susy ) , supersymmetric models are promising candidates for physics beyond the sm .",
    "it is an experimental fact that susy must be broken if it is realized in nature . here , we consider the anomaly  mediated susy breaking scenario ( amsb ) where the supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector is transmitted into the observable sector by the super - weyl anomaly @xcite . below the compactification scale",

    "it has been suggested a long time ago that supersymmetry and neutrino masses and mixings may be deeply tied together @xcite .",
    "one way of giving mass to the neutrinos in supersymmetric models is via bilinear @xmath0parity violation ( brpv ) : in such model , bilinear terms which violates lepton number as well as @xmath0parity are introduced in the superpotential @xcite . as a consequence , one neutrino acquires mass at tree level due to a low energy",

    "the other two neutrinos become massive via one  loop corrections to the neutralino  neutrino mass matrix @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that brpv can be successfully embedded into models with amsb @xcite giving rise at tree level to a neutrino mass compatible with the atmospheric neutrino mass scale . here",
    ", we generalize this model including lepton number violating interaction in the three generations and we show that the inclusion of one  loop corrections to the neutralino  neutrino mass matrix leads to a neutrino spectrum and mixings compatible with the available data .",

    "trivial since the radiative corrections depend on the susy spectrum and it is not clear _ a priori _ that the corrections will have the required properties after we impose the existing limits on the susy mass spectrum .",

    "the scalar potential of brpv models is such that the sneutrino fields acquire a non zero vacuum expectation value @xmath11 that leads to the generation of neutrino mass and mixing angles . even in the basis where the @xmath4 terms are removed from the superpotential ,",
    "the sneutrino fields acquire non - zero vev s @xmath12 @xcite which , from the minimization of the scalar potential , can be shown to satisfy @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 . since there is no reason to assume that these differences are zero _ at the weak scale _ , the sneutrino vev s are not zero either .",

    "it is advantageous to trade @xmath19 by a parameter more directly connected to the neutrino physics observables , therefore , we shall choose the parameters @xmath20 defined below instead of @xmath19 as input parameters .",

    "since the values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 are much smaller than @xmath73 in our reference model , the @xmath61 term gives rise to the most important contribution .",
    "the two neutrino masses in eq .",
    "( [ numasses ] ) are hierarchical , therefore the squares of @xmath74 and @xmath75 are a good first approximation to the atmospheric and solar mass squared differences .",
    "let us initially analyze the dependence of the neutrino masses and mixings upon the amsb parameters . in fig .",
    "[ m0 - 1 ] it is shown the dependence on the scalar mass @xmath17 of the predicted atmospheric neutrino mass squared difference @xmath76 ( red solid line ) and the solar neutrino mass squared difference @xmath77 ( blue dashed line ) , for fixed values @xmath78 tev , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 and for the brpv parameters given in ( [ basic : brpv ] ) . as we can see from this figure , @xmath76 is a decreasing function of @xmath17 while @xmath77 has a more complex behavior .",
    "when the scalar mass @xmath17 increases the masses of the scalar susy particles grow , and consequently , decoupling effects make the @xmath61 term to diminish .",
    "in fact all three terms @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 in the texture ( [ texture ] ) decrease with @xmath17 .",
    "this explains why the atmospheric mass decreases monotonically with @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ m0 - 1 ] .",
    "nevertheless , this phenomenon does not happen for the solar mass due to the minus sign in eq .",
    "( [ numasses ] ) which causes the complex behavior .",
    "for instance , at large @xmath17 the square root decreases a slightly faster than the term outside the square root , increasing the solar mass as observed in fig .",
    "[ m0 - 1 ] .",
    "we can also see from fig .",
    "[ m0 - 1 ] that @xmath76 is within the present experimental bounds for @xmath84 tev while @xmath85 satisfies the experimental constraints for @xmath86 gev and @xmath87 tev . therefore",
    ", our models lead to acceptable neutrino masses provided @xmath86 gev or @xmath88 tev for all other parameters fixed at their reference values .",
    "it is also important to notice that the heaviest neutrino state has a mass of the order of @xmath89 ev for our reference point and that it decreases as @xmath17 increases .",
    "moreover , the radiative corrections lead to a contribution of @xmath90 , therefore , the tree  level result for the neutrino mass is a good order of magnitude estimative .",
    "we depict in fig .",
    "[ m0 - 3 ] the tangent squared of the atmospheric ( solar ) angle @xmath91 as a function of @xmath17 for our reference point .",
    "as we can see from this figure , there is a small dependence on @xmath17 of the atmospheric mixing angle and a milder one of the solar mixing . due to the importance of one  loop corrections , the lowest order approximated expressions ( [ mix : atm ] ) and ( [ mix : solar ] ) do not describe the dependence of the solar and atmospheric mixings on the scalar mass @xmath17 ; in order to understand this behavior we should use the full one  loop approximation ( [ tanatmapp ] ) . for @xmath73 ,",
    "this expression reduces to @xmath92    we checked that there is a clear decrease of the parameter @xmath61 with @xmath17 , while @xmath62 slightly increases , explaining the slope in the atmospheric angle curve .",
    "we verified further that a similar effect happens for @xmath18 , , a very mild dependence of the solar angle and a slight decrease of @xmath93 with increasing @xmath18 , since its tree level contribution to @xmath61 is inversely proportional to the gaugino masses .",
    "note from eqs .",
    "( [ tanatmapp ] ) and ( [ tanatmapp2 ] ) that the fact that @xmath71 and @xmath72 have different signs is responsible for preventing the atmospheric angle to be maximal since @xmath73 in our reference model .    in fig .",
    "[ m32 - 1 ] we display the dependence of the atmospheric and solar mass squared differences on the gravitino mass @xmath18 for the other parameters assuming their reference values .",
    "first of all , the observed dependence is much stronger compared to the dependence on @xmath17 ; this is expected due to the large impact of @xmath18 on the soft gaugino masses , which together with @xmath94 define the tree ",
    "level neutrino mass matrix .",
    "moreover , the susy spectrum has a large impact on the one  loop corrections increasing the sensitivity to @xmath18 .",
    "both solar and atmospheric squared mass differences are too large in the region of small gravitino masses , however , this region is already partially ruled out since it leads to charginos lighter than the present experimental bounds for @xmath95 tev .",
    "conversely , there is no acceptable solution for the neutrino masses at large @xmath18 , again a region partially ruled out by data since the staus are too light in this region .",
    "furthermore , we can see from this figure that our amsb ",
    "brpv model leads to acceptable neutrino masses for a small window of the gravitino mass ( @xmath96 ) given our choice of parameters .",
    "this is far from trivial since we have no _ a priori _ guaranty that we can generate the required neutrino spectrum , specially the radiative corrections , satisfying at the same time the experimental constraints on the superpartner masses .    in fig .",
    "[ tgb-1 ] we present @xmath76 and @xmath97 as a function of @xmath98 with all other parameters fixed at their reference values .",
    "clearly , @xmath76 has a very mild dependence upon @xmath98 since it is dominated by the tree level contributions .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath85 presents a strong dependence on this parameter , exhibiting an acceptable solution only for a very narrow range @xmath99 .",
    "this is a consequence of the strong dependence of the radiative corrections on @xmath100 .",
    "the effective interaction @xmath101 generated after the diagonalization of the neutralino  neutrino mass matrix has a coupling @xmath102 that exhibits a term proportional to @xmath98 , leading to the observed strong dependence .",
    "in other words , the neutrino mixes with the higgsino , which couples to bottom - sbottom via the bottom yukawa coupling which increases with @xmath100 . at large @xmath100 ,",
    "the lightest stau become lighter than the present experimental bounds , therefore , this region is already experimentally excluded .",
    "the neutrino masses and mixings present a rich structure when we vary the brpv parameters .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ eigen ] the neutrino masses as a function of @xmath71 keeping all other parameters fixed at the reference value ; the smallest mass eigenvalue is not displayed and it is usually smaller than @xmath103 ev .",
    "as we can see , there is one eigenvalue of the effective neutrino mass matrix that is approximately constant since it is associated to the tree level neutrino mass .",
    "however , as @xmath104 grows the radiative corrections start to become important and even to dominate ; we observe the same behavior of the neutrino masses with @xmath105 and @xmath72 .",
    "this is the origin of the level crossing that we see in this figure .",
    "[ e2:dm ] presents the dependence on @xmath71 of the predicted atmospheric neutrino squared mass difference @xmath76 ( red solid line ) and the solar neutrino squared mass difference @xmath97 ( blue dashed line ) for all other parameters fixed at the reference values .",
    "the cusps we observe in this figure are due to the crossing of eigenvalues of the effective neutrino mass matrix and the fact that we order the neutrino masses @xmath106 .",
    "moreover , it is clear from this figure that the solar neutrino squared mass difference excludes a larger fraction of the parameter space than the corresponding atmospheric difference ; not only the solar squared mass difference is more precisely known , but also the radiative corrections exhibit a strong dependence on @xmath71 . nevertheless , there are still two regions where both constraints are satisfied simultaneously . in the region of this figure where the values of @xmath104 are small",
    "we can understand the observed dependence on @xmath71 : the key element is the fact that the term dependent on @xmath62 in the square root in eq .",
    "( [ numasses ] ) is numerically smaller than the term dependent on @xmath61 .",
    "when this condition is fulfilled the following approximated expressions for the two heaviest neutrinos are valid for @xmath73 @xmath107 and as before , we approximate the atmospheric and the solar mass differences by @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively . in this way ,",
    "the quadratic growing of the solar mass with @xmath71 is clear , and the quadratic decreasing of the atmospheric mass is also clear knowing that the term proportional to @xmath61 is positive and larger than the negative term proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ e2:tan ] the mixings @xmath110 as a function of @xmath71 for our reference point .",
    "once again , we can see clearly the crossing of the eigenvalues of the effective neutrino mass matrix that leads to the cusps in this figure .",
    "furthermore , we observe a sharp peak on the solar angle at small values of @xmath71 which is well explained by eq .",
    "( [ mix : solar ] ) that predicts that @xmath111 diverges for @xmath112 , _ i.e. _ @xmath113 gev for our reference point . the one  loop approximation ( [ mix : solar ] ) also describes well the solar mixing for our reference point predicting that @xmath114 .",
    "conversely , the behavior of @xmath115 with @xmath71 is well described by the approximated expression ( [ tanatmapp2 ] ) which predicts @xmath116 ( 1 ) for our reference point ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "lastly , radiative corrections are also important for @xmath118 to satisfy the chooz bounds since , for our reference point , the tree ",

    "<S> we show that a supersymmetric standard model exhibiting anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking can generate naturally the observed neutrino mass spectrum as well mixings when we include bilinear @xmath0parity violation interactions . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> one of the neutrinos gets its mass due to the tree level mixing with the neutralinos induced by the @xmath0parity violating interactions while the other two neutrinos acquire their masses due to radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> one interesting feature of this scenario is that the lightest supersymmetric particle is unstable and its decay can be observed at high energy colliders , providing a falsifiable test of the model . </S>"
