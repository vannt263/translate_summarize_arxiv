    "<S> it is also an upper bound for the measured relative entropy distance of the state to its reconstructed version . </S>",
    "<S> the main ingredient of the proof is the fact that the conditional mutual information is the optimal quantum communication rate in the task of state redistribution .    .75ex    </S>",

    "<S> one of the central quantities of the classical information theory that directly generalizes to quantum information is the conditional mutual information ( cmi ) . for a tripartite state @xmath0 it is defined as    @xmath1    with @xmath2 as von neumann entropy . </S>",

    "<S> the main idea is the following : suppose that in the state redistribution protocol bob does not receive any quantum communication from alice , but instead he `` mocks '' the communication ( locally preparing the maximally mixed state in @xmath79 ) and applies the decoding map @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> it will follow that even though the output state might be very far from the target one , the relative entropy per copy of the output state and the original one can not be larger than twice the amount of communication of the protocol ( which is given by the conditional mutual information ) .

    "<S> let @xmath83 be the state after the encoding operation .    using the operator inequality @xmath84 , valid for every state @xmath85 </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath86 with @xmath87 as the maximally mixed state on @xmath77 and @xmath79 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we used @xmath88 , which holds true since @xmath89 only acts nontrivially on @xmath90    let @xmath91 be the decoding operation of bob in state redistribution ( see lemma [ lemredistribution ] ) and define @xmath92 , with @xmath93 the depolarizing channel mapping all states to the maximally mixed . since @xmath94 is completely positive , using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ opineqphi ] ) we get @xmath95    from the operator monotonicity of the @xmath96 ( see lemma  [ opmon ] in the supplemental material ) , @xmath97    eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ correctenessstateredistribution ] ) gives @xmath98    because @xmath99 ( with @xmath100 the maximally mixed state on @xmath101 ) , lemma  [ audenaerte ] in the supplemental material gives @xmath102 and so @xmath103    even though we do not know whether    @xmath104    it turns out that a similar inequality holds true if we replace the relative entropy by its measured variant ( see sec . </S>",
    "<S> b in the supplemental material ) : for every state @xmath0 one has    @xmath105    * discussion and open problems . * </S>",

    "<S> we can ask whether eq .   holds with equality . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that this is false and can be disproved using pure states of dimension @xmath107 and the transpose channel , defined for a tripartite state @xmath0 as @xmath108    .[fig : numerics],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig .  </S>",
