    "heavy quarkonium is a multiscale system , which offers a good testing ground for investigating the qcd in both perturbative and nonperturbative regimes . the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite as a rigorous theoretical framework to describe the heavy quarkonium production and decay has been widely investigated both in experimental and theoretical aspects .",
    "people believe that nrqcd , the only effective field theory allowing for consistent qcd - based calculations beyond the born approximation , may be the most promising theory to describe the heavy quarkonium physics .    through efforts from both the experimental and theoretical sides ,",
    "substantial progress has been achieved in heavy quarkonium physics , many processes have been calculated to next - to - leading order(nlo ) in @xmath6 @xcite . for the prompt @xmath5 production ,",
    "almost all the relevant observable predictions are available at the nlo , and based on different philosophies , the color - octet(co ) long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) of @xmath5 have been extracted by three groups independently .",
    "it has been found that for quarkonium production and decay in the framework of nrqcd in many cases the leading order(lo ) calculation is inadequate and the nlo qcd corrections are crucial .",
    "the discrepancies between lo calculations and unpolarized experimental results are fairly well described by the nrqcd theory through including higher order corrections@xcite .",
    "but for polarization production , though the nlo corrections have been considered , people are not able to fully explain the polarization production by theoretical analyses in a way consistent with the world data on the unpolarized yield , and the polarization puzzle still poses a challenge to the heavy quarkonium physics@xcite",
    ".    therefore , a further test the mechanism of quarkonium production is needed , and more processes of heavy quarkonium production and decay should be investigated .",
    "the study of the production for excited charmonium other than @xmath5 may also be valuable , not only is the study of excited heavy quarkonium production important for @xmath5 production for the excited heavy quarkonium to be able to radiatively decay to @xmath5 , but also the study of excited heavy quarkonium production itself can directly deepen our understanding about qcd .",
    "many processes of @xmath0 @xmath7 production at the tevatron and lhc have been studied up to the nlo , and the @xmath8>}{<{\\cal o}^{\\chi_{c0}}[^3p_0^{(1 ) } ] > } $ ] has been given by using the tevatron data , lhcb data and cms data .",
    "but its accuracy is not very satisfying ; the @xmath9 value can be varied from @xmath10 to @xmath11 in fitting different data with different hypotheses @xcite .    at the lhc , the latest estimations for @xmath12 range from @xmath13 pb  @xcite to @xmath14 pb  @xcite for @xmath15 gev and @xmath16 tev .",
    "therefore , it is significant to perform detailed study of heavy quarkonium production from top - quark decay at the lhc .",
    "many heavy quarkonium productions from top - quark decay processes have been calculated at the lo@xcite , and the decay widths of top quark to s - wave @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 bound states at the nlo are available now@xcite . for the investigation of @xmath20 processes may provide important information not only for the @xmath5 associated with @xmath1 production from top - quark decay but also can provide an excellent platform to extract the universality ldmes of @xmath0 . in this paper",
    ", we will calculate the @xmath20 processes up to the nlo in @xmath6 within the nrqcd framework by applying the covariant projection method@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we present the details of the calculation strategies , and sec.iii is arranged to present the numerical results .",
    "finally , a short summary and discussions are given .",
    "in this section , we present the calculation about the decay width for processes @xmath21 to the nlo of @xmath6 . at the lo , only the @xmath22 fock state has made a contribution , and the feynman diagrams for this partonic process are drawn in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) . in the nonrelativistic limit , the short - distance coefficients of @xmath22 fock state for processes @xmath21 are the same as the process @xmath23 in @xmath22 fock state at the lo . applying the covariant - projector method of ref.@xcite",
    ", we can get analytic short - distance coefficients of processes @xmath21 , which are the same as in refs.@xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig . 6 , we also give the ratio @xmath24 at the nlo as a function of the matrix element ratio @xmath9 and varying it from 0.31 to 0.40 .",
    "if we only consider the lo contribution , we can get the ratio to be @xmath25 by spin counting easily .",
    "however , at the nlo , the ratio @xmath26 has been changed significantly for the @xmath27-state contribution . when varying @xmath9 from 0.31 to 0.40 , the ratio @xmath26 can be changed from 0.31 to 1.22 . with the growth of the value of @xmath9 , the @xmath27-state contribution will become less important , and the ratio @xmath26 will tend to be the spin counting result @xmath25 .",
    "in conclusion , we have considered the nlo qcd corrections for the excited charmonium production processes @xmath28 in top - quark decay .",
    "these processes are an interesting platform for studying the heavy quarkonium production mechanism .",
    "we adopt the dimensional regularization to deal with the uv and ir singularities in our calculation .",
    "the coulomb singularities and soft singularities in @xmath29 state are isolated and absorbed into the nrqcd nlo - corrected operator @xmath30>$ ] . after adding all contributing components together",
    ", we obtain the results with uv , ir , and coulomb safety . in these processes ,",
    "the co contributions are dominant at the lo .",
    "when we use the @xmath31 subtraction scheme in renormalizing the nrqcd ldmes @xmath32>$ ] and set factorization scale @xmath33 , the nlo co gives a big positive correction , and the @xmath27 fock state gives a negative contribution . from our calculation , detecting @xmath2 production from top - quark decay may be very difficult , but @xmath3 and @xmath4 production may have the potential to be detected at the lhc .",
    "detailed study of the prompt @xmath0 production from top - quark decay at the lhc is not only very useful for investigating @xmath5 production from top - quark decay but is also important in understanding the heavy quarkonium production mechanism .",
