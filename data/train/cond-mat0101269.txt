    "during the last decade evidence emerged from theoretical work@xcite and from experiments on cuprates@xcite and closely related nickelates@xcite for the existence of striped structures within the @xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath2 cu , ni ) planes .",
    "these stripes are highly correlated states of holes which are introduced into the planes by doping and which order into a unidirectional@xcite charge - density wave ( cdw , wave length @xmath3 ) that may be accompanied by a simultaneous spin - density wave of period @xmath4 in the sublattice magnetization of the antiferromagnetic metallic spins.@xcite qualitatively , one may think of stripes as parallel strings of holes that constitute an antiphase boundary for spin order .",
    "particular interest in these stripes arises from the possible interplay@xcite between these stripes and superconductivity .",
    "thereby it is important to distinguish between `` dynamic '' and `` static '' stripes . while there is evidence that superconductivity can coexist with both dynamic@xcite and static@xcite stripes , static stripes tend to suppress superconductivity,@xcite in contrast to dynamic stripes .",
    "therefore the study of the structure and dynamics of stripes is of principal importance .",
    "various phenomenological pictures have been developed for the theoretical description of stripes . while charge and spin order are naturally described within a landau theory,@xcite the aspect that stripes act as magnetic domain walls suggests to describe them as string - like objects.@xcite in the ideally ordered case these strings form a periodic array .",
    "dynamic fluctuations are generated by thermal and quantum effects , whereas potentials tend to suppress dynamic fluctuations while they may reduce or increase static conformations of the stripes .",
    "in such phenomenological models , the crystalline structure of the underlying atomic lattice ( period @xmath5 ) has to be taken into account by a periodic potential , which tends to increase the positional order of the stripe array since is can be the source of lock - in effects.@xcite on the other hand , the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of dopants provides a disorder potential for the stripes because of the ( screened ) coulomb interaction between dopants and holes .",
    "for low enough temperatures , these dopants can be considered as quenched .",
    "pinning by the periodic potential is of particular interest since lock - in effects might explain the special role of certain values for the stripe spacing . in the cuprate system la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 ,",
    "the mismatch @xmath9 of magnetic bragg satellite peaks has a nonzero value only beyond a threshold doping @xmath10 , where @xmath11 holds .",
    "eventually a saturation value @xmath12 is observed for @xmath13.@xcite since the mismatch @xmath9 is related to the lattice and cdw periods via @xmath14 , it allows for a natural explanation@xcite of the `` @xmath15-problem'':@xcite since at @xmath16 the periods of the cdw and the cu spacings have an integer ratio @xmath17 this saturation could be a commensuration effect.@xcite similarly , the nickelate system la@xmath6sr@xmath7nio@xmath18 shows anomalous thermodynamic behavior at the values @xmath19@xcite which seem to be stable over certain respective ranges of the hole concentration @xmath20.@xcite even more , evidence was reported@xcite for plateaus of the mismatch as a function temperature at rational values @xmath21 , @xmath22 in la@xmath1nio@xmath23 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the stripe array can also be pinned by disorder.@xcite therefore it is important to take a closer look at the competitive pinning by the periodic atomic lattice and by disorder in order to understand to what extent lock - in effects can persist . a first step in this direction",

    "et al._@xcite who focus on a _ single _ stripe .",
    "however , since a single stripe and a stripe array differ in dimensionality one expects qualitatively distinct behavior of the response of the system to disorder .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine the effects of periodic and disorder potentials on the structural order of the two - dimensional stripe array on large scales .",
    "quantum fluctuations turn out to be irrelevant in the presence of disorder , i.e. the system behaves essentially as a classical stripe array .",
    "we find that a locked state with long - ranged positional order can exist only in the absence of disorder .",

    "the creation of @xmath128 solitons is equivalent to the creation of a magnetic domain in a random - field ising model . for a strong periodic pinning potential , @xmath129 ,",
    "the soliton has a narrow border of width @xmath130 and of an energy per unit length @xmath131 .",
    "thus the elastic energy cost is proportional to the border length , @xmath132 . in the area of the soliton",
    "the strings are exposed to a different disorder potential @xmath64 ( we assume the disorder correlation length to be small , @xmath133 ) .",

    "this gain is larger than the elastic energy cost for solitons of all sizes for a disorder strength beyond a threshold value @xmath135 however , for large solitons one has to take into account that the soliton border will be roughened by disorder .",
    "the equivalent roughening of domain walls in the random field ising model was studied in refs . .",
    "as a consequence , the border line tension @xmath136 is renormalized to zero on a finite length scale @xmath137 where @xmath138 is a constant of order unity .",
    "the creation of solitons of a size @xmath127 larger than @xmath139 is thus energetically favorable .",
    "overlapping solitons of unbounded size imply a roughness of the stripe array , provided the sum of the shifts @xmath140 at a given position increases with the number of solitons ( enumerated by the index @xmath141 ) that include this site . in principle , the interaction between solitons could lead to a compensation of the shifts between pairs of solitons .",
    "however , the interaction between the solitons is short - ranged on the scale @xmath142 and it can not compete with a disorder energy that discriminates between a shift @xmath143 and a @xmath144 for each soliton .",
    "although the pinning energy of these two states is identical in the bulk area , the disorder energy of these two solitons is different in the border region and leads to an energy contribution proportional to @xmath145 .",
    "therefore the multiple creation of large and overlapping solitons leads to uncorrelated contributions to shifts @xmath146 and therefore implies the roughness of the stripe array on scales beyond @xmath139 . in this sense @xmath42",
    "is irrelevant on large scales in the presence of arbitrarily weak @xmath64 , although on small scales the stripes will be confined to valleys of @xmath42 . since @xmath42 is irrelevant , the stripe array will be superrough as in the absence of @xmath42 .",
    "although the case @xmath147 appears not to be of physical relevance for striped systems , we add as a side remark that for @xmath147 a flat phase can exist . in this case",
    "the elastic energy cost @xmath148 of a soliton can not be compensated by a disorder energy which no longer has a bulk contribution @xmath148 but only a border contribution @xmath149 .",
    "strictly speaking , we have shown the irrelevance of @xmath42 only for integer values of @xmath68 . since noninteger rational values of @xmath68",
    "would correspond to commensurabilities of higher order , they are even more susceptible to the destruction of long - range order by @xmath42 .",

    "thus , in any case @xmath164 and the system flows to the classical fixed point value for @xmath208 .",
    "quantum effects will result only in a finite renormalization of the parameters in the classical system .",
    "the most important renormalization effect concerns an increase of the dynamic stiffness with a possible generation of @xmath204 .",
    "although there is no way of handling a kinetic action of the form ( [ s_kin_nu ] ) , we expect quantum fluctuations on small scales to induce a flat but finite quantum contribution @xmath177 to the displacement correlation .",
    "the classical contribution @xmath178 will be renormalized as in the absence of quantum fluctuations [ the proper correlation can be obtained from equation ( [ c_2 ] ) by inserting the scale - dependent values of @xmath49 and @xmath95 as obtained from the flow equations ( [ flow_sr ] ) without rescaling ; in the superrough phase @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "since the presence of the disorder potential implies the irrelevance of quantum fluctuations , they can not be expected to modify the competition between @xmath42 and @xmath64 as was analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec_combi ] .",
    "thus , the quantum array has superrough spatial correlations at @xmath58 .",
    "an inspection of the correlator ( [ corr_u_el ] ) of the unpinned system suggests that thermal fluctuations dominate over quantum fluctuations on large scales .",
    "in fact , quantum fluctuations are irrelevant at the classical fixed point also for @xmath152 .",
    "this can be seen from the action as follows",
    ". the classical fixed points ( with both thermal roughness or superroughness ) are described by @xmath193 .",
    "the finiteness of the time integral implies @xmath211 and according to eq .",
    "( [ eta_rel ] ) also @xmath168 .",
    "then the effective `` dynamical stiffness '' flows to infinity according to eq .",
    "( [ flow.mu ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ flow.nu ] ) .",
    "thereby temporal fluctuations of the displacement are suppressed on large scales , on which the system is described by the static limit @xmath212 thus quantum fluctuations will lead only to a renormalization of the parameters in the classical description . therefore the scaling arguments that were applied in section [ sec_class ] to the hamiltonian hold also for the dynamic action .",
    "thus the system in disorder will be superrough at low temperatures  without or with an additional periodic potential  while it will be thermally rough at high temperatures .",
    "so far , we have analyzed the stripe array in the elastic approximation , i.e. neglecting dislocations .",
    "before we discuss the relevance of dislocations , we summarize our results . in general , we found quantum fluctuations to be irrelevant in the presence of thermal and/or disorder - induced fluctuations , i.e. , to renormalize the classical elastic model only weakly .    in the absence of disorder ( @xmath213 ) , the stripe array locks into a commensurate periodic potential below a roughening temperature @xmath214 .",
    "this transition temperature is proportional to the stiffness @xmath33 which is implicitly temperature dependent due to an entropic contribution @xmath215.@xcite if there were only this entropic contribution , the system would always be unlocked ( @xmath216 ) at finite temperatures for @xmath217 .",
    "however , a temperature independent contribution to @xmath33 , which arises from the coulomb interaction , leads to a lock - in transition at a finite temperature for @xmath217 , where the translational order changes from long ranged to quasi - long ranged ( with logarithmic roughness ) .",
    "the large - scale structure of the stripe array is dramatically influenced by the presence of disorder ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "if there were no periodic potential , the stripe array would undergo a superroughening transition at @xmath219 . for @xmath97",
    "the array would be unpinned with @xmath105-roughness , while it would be pinned and superrough for @xmath220 .",
    "the same scenario holds also in the presence of the periodic potential , from which the stripe array always unlocks ( on sufficiently large scales even for arbitrarily weak disorder ) .",
    "therefore , the array is _ rough at all temperatures _ for @xmath218 .",
    "for weak disorder and strong periodic potential the crossover length scale from flat to superrough correlations will be exponentially large , cf . eq .",
    "( [ l_eps ] ) .",
    "hasselmann _ et al._@xcite previously proposed a phase diagram for a single stripe with flat and disordered phases . to our understanding",
    ", the disorder was effectively assumed to have long - ranged correlations , which allows for the existence of a flat phase even for a single stripe .",
    "in contrast to this we consider disorder with short - ranged correlations and find that it always roughens the stripe array .",
    "because a single stripe represents an elastic system of lower dimensionality than the stripe array , our finding implies also the roughness of a single stripe in disorder with short - ranged correlations .",
    "now we come back to discuss the relevance of topological defects in the stripe array , starting with the simplest situation for @xmath221 . at low temperatures",
    "the stripe array can be considered as a `` smectic '' with quasi - long - range translational order and long - range orientational order . at a temperature @xmath222",
    "it would melt@xcite due to a proliferation of dislocations into a `` nematic '' liquid with short - range translational order and quasi - long - range orientational order , before the proliferation of disclinations drives a second transition into an isotropic liquid with short - ranged orientational order . while this scenario is well known for classical systems ( for a review see e.g. ref . ) , its relevance to doped mott insulators was pointed out by kivelson , fradkin , and emery.@xcite    it is instructive to compare the melting temperature to the other characteristic temperatures related to the potentials . as pointed out by jos _ et al._,@xcite distinct melting and lock - in transitions can exist only for @xmath223 since @xmath224 .",
    "for @xmath225 they will merge to a single phase transition .",
    "the effect of disorder is quite virulent : in the elastic approximation , it makes the system superrough at temperatures below @xmath226 .",
    "however , superroughness implies that dislocations become energetically favorable [ this follows from the flow equations ( [ flow_sr ] ) , see .",
    "e.g. ref . ] .",
    "therefore , their density will be finite even at zero temperature .",
    "nevertheless , for weak disorder and at low temperatures the length scale where free dislocation appear can be extremely large because of a @xmath42 that tends to lock the stripes up to exponentially large scales .",
    "since melting in the absence of disorder occurs at a temperature , @xmath227 , free dislocations will be present at _ all _ temperatures .",
    "the presence of dislocations reduces the quasi - long - range order ( where the satellite peaks have an algebraic singularity due to the @xmath105-roughness ; @xmath106-roughness corresponds to an algebraic singularity with an exponent that depends weakly on the wave vector ) to short - range order with a correlation length of the order of the distance between ( free ) dislocations .",
    "thus , the saturation of the dislocation density at low temperatures implies also the saturation of the correlation length at a maximum value .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with experimental observations in the cuprates@xcite ( here it was observed in magnetic ordering , which can be destroyed due to a coupling to disorder even without a distortion of the stripe array ) as well as in the nickelates@xcite ( here the correlation length is explicitly that of charge order ) .",
    "note that the _ true _ correlation length of charge order @xmath228 ( which we identify with the distance between free dislocations ) can be related to the measured width of peaks in the structure function only if the wave - vector resolution is much smaller than @xmath229 .",
    "thus , a system without dislocations ( with @xmath105- or @xmath106-roughness ) has an infinite correlation length and the _ apparent _ correlation length deduced from experiments would be resolution limited .",
    "zachar@xcite recently proposed an explanation of the observed apparent correlation lengths in terms of chaotic fluctuations of the distance between neighboring stripes ( see also ref . ) , excluding explicitly a key role of dislocations .",
    "however , this argument is based on the assumption of noninteger @xmath68 and can not account for the finite correlation length observed for integer @xmath68 in the nickelates@xcite and the cuprates.@xcite it also can not explain why the transverse correlation length ( along the stripes )  which apparently is not resolution limited@xcite  can be finite .",
    "even more , the fact that longitudinal and transverse correlation lengths are roughly of the same size@xcite is consistent with their relation to the dislocation density .",
    "as both the roughening transition is washed out by disorder and the superroughening transition is washed out by the presence of dislocations , no sharp transition will exist in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "nevertheless , crossover phenomena may be observable . for weak disorder and/or strong lattice potential",
    "the stripe array appears to be locked to the lattice potential up to very large length scales .",
    "it `` unlocks '' also on finite scales with increasing temperature or decreasing lattice potential .",
    "an apparent lock - in transition was observed@xcite in la@xmath230nd@xmath231sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 where the strength of the lattice potential corresponds to the nd concentration . since @xmath232 the density of free dislocations will be high near @xmath102 so that reminiscences on finite scales of the superroughening transition are unlikely to survive .",
    "since the array has short - range order at all temperatures for @xmath218 we expect the absence of commensurate / incommensurate transitions ( identified from fluctuations on asymptotically large length scales ) .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental observations of anomalies at particular values of @xmath68 can be related to the effects of @xmath42 on finite length scales .    in view of our conclusion about the absence of commensuration effects we comment on the @xmath12 problem , i.e. , the observation that @xmath233 apparently saturates at @xmath12 near a doping @xmath234 of the cuprates .",
    "if this were a commensuration effect as suggested previously , @xcite one would expect to observe the value @xmath12 around @xmath15 , i.e. above ( @xmath235 ) and below ( @xmath236 ) the matching @xmath237 . to the best of our knowledge ( cf .",
    "the data collected in fig . 7 of ref . ) , there is no evidence for data with @xmath236 . as pointed out by yamada",
    "_ et al._,@xcite the saturation of @xmath9 coincides with a saturation of the effective hole concentration in the cuo@xmath1 planes beyond a certain doping level @xmath238 .",
    "thus it is conceivable that other mechanisms limit the effective hole concentration and lead to a plateau in @xmath9 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have pointed out the relevance of disorder for a stripe array even in states where its period is commensurate with the atomic structure .",
    "we found that on large scales pinning by disorder dominates over pinning by the atomic structure .",
    "this induces the superroughness of the array and , on sufficiently large scales , the presence of free dislocations even at low temperatures , which explains the saturation of the correlation length observed in experiments .",
    "the authors are grateful to t. nattermann for stimulating discussions and valuable hints .",
    "they acknowledge financial support by deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through sbf341 .",
    "note that our usage of the notions commensurate and incommensurate follows the traditional usage in the context of commensurate - incommensurate transitions.@xcite we distinguish _ incommensurability _ from a _ mismatch _ @xmath9 of bragg peaks in the structure factor , whreas in the stripe literature incommensurability is used synonymously to mismatch .",
    "our notions allow to distinguish incommensurate and commensurate states with finite mismatch",
