    "the experimental discovery of the inclusive and exclusive decays @xmath4 and @xmath5 by the cleo collaboration [ 1,2 ] has triggered a lot of theoretical and the experimental activity in the field of rare decays of b- mesons .",
    "these decays are interesting for checking the predictions of sm at one - loop level , for determining the ckm matrix elements , and for looking for the `` new physics '' beyond the sm . from the experimental point of view another promising decay in this direction",
    "is the semileptonic decay @xmath6 , because this decay is easier to measure provided that we are given a good electromagnetic detector and a large number of b hadrons .",
    "theoretically this decay has been the subject of many works in the framework of the sm [ 3,4,5,6 ] and its extensions , particulary in two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "@xmath7 decay is an fcnc process which appears only at the one- loop level of pertubation theory .",
    "the basic thing about this decay is that the penguin diagrams provide the two key ingredients needed for partial rate asymmetries .",
    "being a loop diagram , it involves all three generations , each generation contributing with different elements of the ckm matrix . at the same time",
    "the loop effects that involve on- shell particle rescatterings provide the necessary absorbtive parts .",
    "it is well known that in 2hdm , @xmath7 decay receives significant contributions from the charged higgs ( @xmath8 ) exchange [ 7 ] .",
    "another interesting pecularity of 2hdm is the appearence of new sources of cp violation [ 8 ] in addition to the one in sm .",
    "an interesting version of 2hdm , so called the most general 2hdm , which was proposed in [ 9 ] , has a new source of cp violation , arising from the relative phase between the vacuum expectation values of two higgs scalars .    in this work",
    "we shall work out @xmath7 decay .",
    "in particular we shall determine the cp asymmetry @xmath9 and the ratio @xmath10 as functions of the charged higgs mass .    in the calculation of the cp asymmetry we shall consider both the sm and 2hdm contributions simultaneously .",
    "in determining @xmath11 and @xmath9 we shall make use of the experimental results on @xmath12 [ 1,2 ] , and the neutron electric dilpole moment ( edm ) .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the derivation of basic theoretical results and section 3 contains the numerical analysis of them .",
    "in the most general 2hdm [ 8,9 ] the couplings of @xmath8 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 is characterised by the coefficients @xmath15 defined by @xmath16 where f= t or b , @xmath17 = + for b and - for t , and @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the diagonal elements of the matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively . here",
    "@xmath23 are the matrices in the flavour space , and determine the yukawa couplings ( for more detail see [ 9 ] ) , and @xmath24 is the relative phase between the vacuum expectations of the two higgs scalars : @xmath25 the most general 2hdm reduces to the well - known 2hdm s in the current literature , in certain limiting cases [ 9 ] .",
    "namely , if @xmath26 , then @xmath27 ( model i ) and , if @xmath28 , then @xmath29 ( model ii ) .",
    "as mentioned above the penguin diagrams provide the necessary absorbtive parts for the calculation of the cp asymmetry . in this decay",
    "the dilepton invariant mass @xmath2 ranges from @xmath30 to @xmath31 ; therefore , u and c loops give rise to nonzero absorbtive parts which are described , at the point @xmath32 , by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and the function @xmath35 is given by @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , having the numerical value of 0.3864 , comes from the rge movement of the wilson coefficients from @xmath39 to @xmath40 point .",
    "it is well- known that in the range ( @xmath41 ) one can create real low lying charmonium states [ 10,11 ] . in this work",
    "we shall discard that portion of total dilepton mass range including @xmath42 and @xmath43 poles and the region between them to avoid the addition of new hadronic uncertainities to the decay amplitude .",
    "thus we restrict ourselves to the following kinematical regions [ 6 ] : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the cut- off parameter .    taking into account the 2hdm contributions and absorbtive part described by @xmath46 in ( 3 )",
    ", the amplitude for @xmath7 can be written as @xmath47 the wilson coefficients appearing in ( 7 ) are given by @xmath48\\nonumber\\\\ c^{eff}_{9}(\\mu)&=&\\lambda_{t}[c^{sm}_{9}(\\mu ) + c^{2hdm}_{9}(\\mu ) ] + i\\lambda_{u}a_{9}\\\\ c_{10}(\\mu)&=&\\lambda_{t}[c^{sm}_{10}(\\mu ) + c^{2hdm}_{10}(\\mu)]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the explicit forms of @xmath49 , ( i=7,9,10 ) including leading and next - to - leading order qcd corrections can be found in [ 3,12,13,14 ] .",
    "the 2hdm contributions , @xmath50 , in the framework of the most general 2hdm [ 9 ] are given by @xmath51 where @xmath52,\\;\\ ; i_{tb}=im[\\xi_{t}\\xi^{*}_{b}]$ ] and @xmath53\\nonumber\\\\ k^{tt}_{7 } & = & \\frac{1}{6}\\eta^{16/23}[a(y)+\\frac{8}{3}(1-\\eta^{-2/23})d(y)]\\nonumber\\\\ k^{tt}_{9 } & = & -\\frac{-1 + 4s^{2}_{w}}{s^{2}_{w}}\\frac{x}{2}b(y)+yf(y)\\\\ k^{tt}_{10}&=&-\\frac{1}{s^{2}_{w}}\\frac{x}{2}b(y)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and the explicit expressions for functions @xmath58 can be found in [ 12 ] .",
    "as noted in [ 9 ] , @xmath59 is expected to be of order of unity or less , if the yukawa couplings of the top quark is reasonable .",
    "we have shown that this happens to hold also for the decay process under consideration .",
    "thus , without loosing generality , in what follows we set @xmath60 = 0 ( all the conclusions remain in force for the case of @xmath61 = 1 as well ) .    using ( 7 ) , the differential decay rate for @xmath7 is obtained as @xmath62\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .    after integrating ( 11 ) over @xmath65",

    "on the other hand , insertion of ( 12 ) and ( 15 ) into ( 17 ) yields another circle @xmath80 where @xmath81 the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 in ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) are given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the cp asymmetry in sm which is obtained from ( 17 ) by : @xmath86    up to this point , our analysis of @xmath7 decay parallels that of @xmath0 in [ 9 ] except for the definition of @xmath9 .",
    "we shall , however , analyze the circles in ( 18 ) and ( 20 ) in a different context by exploiting the relation between @xmath87 and neutron edm , and experimental results on @xmath0 branching ratio [ 1,2 ] .",
    "first we obtain the expression for the cp asymmetry in ( 17 ) by subtracting ( 20 ) from ( 18 ) and solving for @xmath9 : @xmath88 where @xmath89    now we turn to the determination of @xmath87 with the use of the experimental upper bound on neutron edm .",
    "weinberg has proposed a cp violating 6 dimensional gluonic operator [ 15 ] @xmath90 which has been shown to give very large contribution to neutron edm , @xmath91 by the neutral [ 15 ] or charged [ 16 ] higgs exchange .",
    "weinberg , after relating the hadronic matrix elements of @xmath92 to @xmath91 , predicts the value of @xmath91 on the basis of a naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) .",
    "however a detailed analysis by bigi and uraltsev [ 17 ] reports a different value for @xmath91 which equals @xmath93 of that of weinberg s .",
    "the big difference between the results of these analyses is an indication of the existence of hadronic uncertainities which are mainly introduced by the matrix elements of @xmath92 between the nucleon states .",
    "in addition to these theoretical uncertainities , we have also problems with experimental data ( in that experiment yields only an upper bound on neutron edm ) .",
    "these can be summarized as @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are constants and @xmath97 is known to be less than unity .",
    "let us note that @xmath95 is related to the theoretical uncertainities and @xmath96 to the experimental uncertainities .",

    "the function @xmath99 in ( 27 ) is given by [ 16,17 ] : @xmath100\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the common point for the analyses in [ 16 ] and [ 17 ] is the presence of the function @xmath99 which is equal to @xmath101 as @xmath102 .    equating ( 27 ) to ( 28 ) and defining @xmath103",
    ", we obtain @xmath104 where @xmath105    note that the constant @xmath106 in ( 30 ) includes now both theoretical and experimental undeterminicies .",
    "we shall not make any assumption concerning the value of @xmath106 ; instead we are going to fix it through the use of the experimental results on @xmath0 branching ratio .",
    "the @xmath0 decay amplitude is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is defined in ( 8) . using the experimental result on the braching ratio of @xmath0 decay [ 1,2 ] we get the following circle @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the experimental value of @xmath108 @xmath111    we shall determine the central values of @xmath106 , @xmath11 and @xmath9 which are defined in equations ( 20 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) respectively . in doing this , we will make use of circles in equations ( 18 ) , ( 20 ) and ( 33 ) together with equation ( 30 ) .",
    "let us note that ( 30 ) is obtained by the use of the experimental upper bound on neutron edm [ 18 ] , and ( 33 ) is constructed with the use of the experimental data on @xmath0 branching ratio [ 1 ] .",
    "let us first determine @xmath106 .",
    "for this purpose we consider the circle in ( 33 ) in the limit of infinitely large @xmath112 or equivalently @xmath113 . as @xmath113 , @xmath114 and through ( 30 ) , @xmath115 , where numerically @xmath116",

    "now we solve ( 33 ) for @xmath118 , yielding @xmath119 where the choice of plus sign is necessary to satisfy asymptotic condition on @xmath118 .    using ( 36 ) for @xmath118 , and ( 30 ) for @xmath87",
    "we can solve equation ( 18 ) for @xmath11 @xmath120 whose @xmath112 dependence shall be discussed in the next section .    finally , taking @xmath11 from ( 37 ) ,",
    "@xmath118 from ( 36 ) and @xmath87 from ( 30 ) we determine the cp asymmetry @xmath9 in ( 24 ) whose dependence on @xmath112 shall also be studied in the next section .",
    "in the numerical analysis we shall use @xmath121 . for the top quark mass we rely on the @xmath122 data [ 19 ] and for the @xmath123 mass we use @xmath124",
    "[ 18 ] .",
    "in calculating @xmath125 and @xmath126 we use the parametrisation in [ 18 ] , and in doing this we take the mid values of the quantities . for the phase @xmath127 of @xmath128 matrix in",
    "[ 18 ] we shall use the the mid value of @xmath129 given in [ 20 ] which icludes a large uncertainity .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that corresponding to the uncertainity in @xmath130 , @xmath126 and @xmath125 are uncertain by @xmath131 and @xmath132 respectively .",
    "thus , the standard model asymmtery @xmath85 in ( 23 ) is uncertain by @xmath132 , and we shall use its central value in our calculations .",
    "this choice is justified by the closeness of @xmath125 and @xmath126 calculated in this way to that obtained by the use of wolfenstein parametrisation [ 21 ] .",
    "1 shows the variation of @xmath133 in ( 29 ) with @xmath112 for the lowest , central and the highest values of @xmath134 permitted by the @xmath122 data [ 19 ] . as we see from fig",
    ". 1 dependence of @xmath133 on @xmath134 is very weak ; thus , insensitivity of results to the variation of @xmath135 with @xmath134 is guaranteed . in",
    "what follows we shall use therefore the central value of @xmath122 data @xmath136 .        in the second column of table 1",
    "we give the values of @xmath106 as @xmath141 moves from its maximum value 0.30 towards @xmath142 .",
    "we see that @xmath143 decreases gradually with decreasing @xmath141 .",
    "moreover , it is seen that the maximum value that @xmath144 .    regarding the present calculations in [ 16 ] and [ 17 ] as the possible candidates for @xmath95 in ( 27 ) , we can make certain predictions for @xmath96 in ( 28 ) .",
    "a simple calculation yields @xmath145 and @xmath146 for weinberg s nda and bigi - uraltsev calculations respectively . in the case of nda , a solution for @xmath96 exist only for @xmath147 at which @xmath148 turns out to be very close to its experimental upper bound .",
    "on the other hand , for bigi - uraltsev calculation , being a more detailed analysis , for all values of @xmath149 ranging from @xmath150 to 0.30 there exists a solution for @xmath151 with the help of which , through ( 28 ) , one determine the value @xmath148 . in the third column of table 1",
    "we give the values of @xmath148 as @xmath141 moves from its maximum value 0.30 towards @xmath142 .",
    "we observe that for @xmath152 @xmath153 reaches its maximum value of @xmath154 which is one order of magnitude less than the present experimental upper bound .",
    "in our numerical analysis we use the range of values of @xmath112 from @xmath155 [ 18 ] to @xmath156 [ 15 ] . in fig . 2 and fig.3 we show the variation of @xmath11 in ( 37 ) with @xmath112 in regions @xmath87 and @xmath157 respectively .",
    "we observe that in both figures @xmath11 is fairly high at low @xmath112 and lands rapidly to a lower value after @xmath158 .",
    "as we see from fig.2 , dependence of @xmath11 on the sign of @xmath106 in region @xmath87 is very weak .",
    "moreover , for @xmath159 , @xmath11 attains the values @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 for @xmath164 , and @xmath165 respectively .    from fig.3",
    "we observe that in region @xmath157 dependence of @xmath11 on the sign of @xmath106 is large .",
    "specificially , we see that , for large @xmath112 , @xmath11 becomes practically independent of @xmath112 and attains the values @xmath166 , and @xmath167 corresponding to @xmath168 and @xmath165 respectively .    in fig.4 and fig.5",
    "we show the variation of @xmath9 in ( 24 ) with @xmath112 in regions @xmath87 and @xmath157 respectively .",
    "what we observe to be common between them is the saturation of cp asymmetry @xmath9 to a certain value after @xmath158 .    from fig.4 we observe that the @xmath169 cp asymmetry @xmath9 , practically for all @xmath112 , is of the same order as the sm cp asymmetry @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , especially for large @xmath112 , corresponding to the values of @xmath106 , @xmath168 and @xmath165 , @xmath9 attains the percentage values of @xmath170 , and @xmath171 .    in fig .",
    "5 we observe that asymmetry @xmath9 , as compared to the previous figure , is completey different in that it is positive and takes higher values for all values of @xmath112 .",
    "actually , we see that for small @xmath112 , @xmath169 cp asymmetry is larger than the sm cp asymmetry by approximately three orders of magnitude . for large @xmath112",
    ", however , @xmath9 gets values which are larger than sm asymmetry by two orders of magnitue .",
    "indeed , for large @xmath112 , corresponding to the values of @xmath106 , @xmath172 and @xmath165 , @xmath9 gets the following percentage values @xmath173 , and @xmath174      to decern a cp asymmetry @xmath9 at the @xmath175 significance level with only statistical errors , the number of @xmath176 hadrons @xmath177 needed to demonstrate the asymmetry is given by[22 ] @xmath178 now denoting the number of @xmath176 hadrons to observe @xmath85 , @xmath9 in @xmath87 and @xmath9 in @xmath157 by @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 respectively , we get , using the values of @xmath11 and @xmath9 we have obtained already , the following ratios @xmath182 which clearly prove that region @xmath157 is more suitable for experimental investigations on @xmath9 .    in conclusion",
    "we have determined the 2hdm cp asymmetry @xmath9 , ratio of 2hdm decay rate to sm decay rate @xmath11 and actual value of neutron edm . in doing these",
    "we have utilized the experimental results on @xmath0 branching ratio , and on the upper bound of neutron edm .",
    "both @xmath11 and @xmath9 relax to constant values after @xmath158 .",
    "this saturation property of quantities shows that if charged higgs mass happens to be large ( @xmath183 ) then the most general @xmath169 merely shifts the sm values of @xmath11 and @xmath9 to some other value which may be important for establishing 2hdm . boldly speaking , in the high dilepton mass region ( region @xmath157 )",
    "@xmath11 is closer to unity and asymmetry is very large as compared to those in low dilepton mass region ( region @xmath87 ) .",
    "thus on the basis of the order of magnitude analysis carried out for @xmath177 , we conclude that the high dilepton mass region is important and appropriate for experimental check of the quantities under concern .",
    "region @xmath157 [ 6 ] is accessible to the @xmath176 experiments which will be carried out with hadron beams in cdf , hera and lhc .",
