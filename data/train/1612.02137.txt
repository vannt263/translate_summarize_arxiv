    "the resulting patterns of oscillating cross - rolls therefore display periodic bursting at the primary instability in very low-@xmath145 fluids .",
    "as the trajectory of any limit cycle during the phenomenon of bursting interacts with a node at the origin ( conduction state ) and two saddle foci ( unstable cross - roll fixed points ) located closely on two sides of the @xmath91-axis , a local bifurcation analysis around the conduction state is unlikely to capture this behavior . as there is only one limit cycle in each quadrant and no saddle fixed point in this case , a homoclinic gluing is not possible .",
    "figure  [ fig : horiz_bif ] shows the bifurcation diagram in the case of horizontal magnetic field .",
    "blue ( black ) and green ( gray ) curves show the variations of the extrema of fourier modes @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively with @xmath101 for @xmath93 in the limit @xmath149 .",
    "the minima of the mode @xmath92 remains as zero near the primary instability .",
    "the convection shows periodic bursting ( pb ) instead of stationary straight rolls at the primary instability for @xmath165 to construct model - ii .",
    "the minima of the mode @xmath92 begins to grow slowly , as @xmath101 is increased further .",
    "there is a smooth transition from bursting behavior to oscillatory behavior without bursting ( ocr ) .",
    "the phenomenon of bursting is also an ocr solution in this case . as the rotational symmetry is broken by the horizontal magnetic field ,",
    "there is only one set of ocr solution .",
    "the limit cycle shrinks to a point in the @xmath107 plane at @xmath166 via an inverse hopf bifurcation .",
    "oscillatory cross - rolls bifurcate to stationary cross - rolls ( cr ) .",
    "there is only one set of stationary cross - rolls for @xmath124 .",
    "the solid red ( gray ) and orange ( light gray ) curves show the variations of the fixed values of the modes @xmath91 and @xmath92 with @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "the broken red and and orange curves give the variations of the values of the modes @xmath91 and @xmath92 with @xmath101 respectively for unstable cross - rolls fixed points .",
    "the inset gives the stationary values of the fourier modes @xmath91 and @xmath92 as a function of @xmath101 for @xmath167 .",
    "the amplitude of a set of rolls aligned to the applied magnetic field is always larger than the same for a set of rolls in the perpendicular direction .",
    "a comparison of the threshold for the inverse hopf bifurcation point obtained from model - ii and dns shows that errors in the value of @xmath168 obtained from the model is within @xmath169 for @xmath96 and within @xmath170 for @xmath171 .",
    "figure  [ fig : horiz_r_q ] shows the possible fluid patterns in different regions of the @xmath172 plane , as obtained from model - ii .",
    "the onset of magnetoconvection appears as oscillating cross - rolls showing periodic bursting ( pb ) for a weak magnetic field in the limit @xmath149 . the rolls with larger amplitude are always aligned to the applied magnetic field above the onset .",
    "as the amplitude of the growing rolls reaches close to its maximum value , a new set of rolls of much smaller amplitude is excited in the direction normal to the applied magnetic field for a very short time .",
    "this brings down the amplitude of the growing rolls to a smaller non - zero value .",
    "as soon as the amplitude of rolls parallel to the magnetic field reaches close to its minimum value , the rolls in the perpendicular direction disappear .",
    "this is different than the dynamics observed in zero - prandtl - number convection  @xcite in the absence of an external magnetic field ( @xmath173 ) , where the phenomena of bursting is always chaotic showing flow reversals .",
    "as @xmath101 is raised slightly , the minimum value of the amplitude of new set of rolls becomes non - zero . as a result",
    ", the phenomenon of bursting disappears .",
    "however , @xmath174 is always much larger than @xmath175 .",
    "we do not observe any homoclinic bifurcation in this case , as the symmetry @xmath91 @xmath176 @xmath92 is broken by the horizontal magnetic field .",
    "when @xmath101 is raised further , the only possible limit cycle shrinks to a point in the phase space leading to a stationary fluid pattern of cross - rolls ( cr ) .",
    "this behavior qualitatively matches with the results obtained from dns for very small values of @xmath145 .",
    "we have investigated the effects of small magnetic field on the homoclinic bifurcations in thermal convection in a low - prandtl - number fluids ( @xmath0 ) using dns .",
    "a series of homoclinic bifurcations occurs near the primary instability in the presence of a weak magnetic field in the vertical direction , as @xmath101 is raised in small steps .",
    "the phenomenon of bursting leads to a periodic replacement of a growing set of rolls after a finite time by a new set of rolls in the direction perpendicular to the older set .",
    "two limit cycles may spontaneously glue into a larger one or a limit cycle may spontaneously break into two smaller ones at homoclinic bifurcations .",
    "as @xmath101 is raised further , the limit cycle solutions bifurcate to stationary cross - rolls through an inverse hopf bifurcation and finally to stationary square patterns via an inverse pitchfork bifurcation .    for a small horizontal magnetic field , a set of rolls aligned normal to the magnetic field",
    "is excited for a short time at regular intervals of time .",
    "this happens in the close vicinity of the primary instability for a low - prandtl - number fluid .",
    "this leads to a sudden fall of the amplitude of rolls aligned along the magnetic field .",
    "the horizontal magnetic field breaks the symmetry of the hydrodynamic system under the rotation by @xmath64 about a vertical axis and allows only one set of limit cycle . a weak horizontal magnetic field acts as a symmetry - breaking perturbation on global bifurcation and it rules out a homoclinic gluing .",
    "as @xmath101 is raised to higher values , the limit cycle solution bifurcates to a set of stationary cross - rolls by inverse hopf bifurcation .",
    "we have also presented minimum - mode models for a weak applied magnetic field , which qualitatively capture the behavior observed in dns for smaller values of @xmath101 .",
