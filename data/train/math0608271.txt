    "a _ branching random walk ( brw ) _ on @xmath7 is a random map from the complete infinite binary tree , @xmath8 into @xmath7 . we shall consider a symmetric brw on @xmath0 with exponentially decreasing steps , defined as follows . start with a single particle at 0 . at each step",
    "each particle multiplies to two particles , and each independently takes a step of size @xmath9 to either direction with equal probabilities .",
    "another equivalent useful formulation is this : for each vertex @xmath10 of the binary tree let @xmath11 be equal to @xmath12 or @xmath13 with probability @xmath14 independently . using these lotteries we define the brw function to be @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "this function is extended to the boundary of the tree , @xmath17 , in the obvious manner , @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the standard uniform measure on @xmath20 .",
    "define @xmath21 to be the image of @xmath22 under @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "this is a random measure on the line , which depends on the choice of signs on the tree .",
    "we are also interested in the properties of the compact support @xmath25 of @xmath21 which is clearly the image of @xmath23 : @xmath26 .",
    "one can view @xmath21 as a stochastically self - similar measure and @xmath25 as a stochastically self - similar set with respect to the appropriate transformations .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and let @xmath29 be a distribution on the pairs of similitudes in @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a random vector of similitudes distributed according to @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , are i.i.d .",
    "copies of @xmath21 independent of @xmath32 .",
    "the symbol @xmath35 denotes equality in distribution .",
    "there is a large literature on stochastically self - similar sets and measures : falconer @xcite , graf @xcite , mauldin and williams @xcite investigated random fractal sets , and u. zhle @xcite , patzshke and u. zhle @xcite , arbeiter @xcite , olsen @xcite , and hutchinson and rschendorf @xcite developed the theory of random fractal measures .",
    "existence , uniqueness , and convergence results have been established under very general assumptions , but results on dimension were obtained mostly under some separation ( `` non - overlapping '' ) conditions .",
    "our case is inherently overlapping for every @xmath36 , since there is a positive probability of having @xmath37 .",
    "overlapping is also allowed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop.6.4 ) , where the translation parts of the similitudes have i.i.d .",
    "absolutely continuous distributions with a bounded density , and dimension formulas are obtained which hold a.s . in the recent work by t. jordan , m. pollicott , and k. simon @xcite , stochastically self - affine sets and measures ( with overlaps )",
    "are studied , which of course , includes stochastically self - similar ones as a special case .",
    "formulas for the dimension and a.s .",
    "absolute continuity are established there under appropriate assumptions . both in @xcite and in the earlier work @xcite , where a different `` overlapping '' random model was investigated , the distributions of the vectors of similitudes are absolutely continuous . in our model ,",
    "on the other hand , these distributions are discrete .",
    "this puts it closer to the infinite bernoulli convolution measures , extensively studied since the 1930 s ( see @xcite ) .",
    "of course , our model can be generalized in many ways : instead of the binary tree one can consider an arbitrary rooted tree , instead of the random variables with values @xmath38 one can take more general discrete random variables , and one can consider projections of different measures on the boundary of the tree .",
    "other possible generalizations are mentioned in section 5 .    in section 2",
    "we adopt an `` intermediate - general '' viewpoint : @xmath39 is the @xmath40-regular tree for @xmath41 .",
    "( on a deterministic non - regular tree we loose stochastic self - similarity ; although some results extend to that case , we do nt consider it here . )",
    "the random variables @xmath42 at the vertices are i.i.d .   with a discrete distribution @xmath43 .",
    "here @xmath44 is a finite set , which will be called a set of `` digits . ''",
    "first we show the `` pure types law '' : for a fixed @xmath45 , the measure @xmath21 is either absolutely continuous ( a.c . ) with respect to the lebesgue measure , or purely singular , almost surely .",
    "this is a simple consequence of uniqueness .",
    "then we adapt the approach of bluhm @xcite to obtain estimates of the expectation of some quantities which involve @xmath46 in terms of the corresponding quantities for the associated deterministic self - similar measure .",
    "more precisely , consider the probability measure @xmath47 , which is the unique solution of the equation @xmath48 see @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath47 is the distribution of the random sum @xmath49 where the coefficients @xmath50 are i.i.d .  with the distribution @xmath51 .",
    "it follows that the fourier transform of @xmath47 may be computed as follows : @xmath52 the classical bernoulli convolution arises this way if we take @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( or any other two distinct digits ) .",

    "we obtain a lot of information on the random measure @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , we have the following    [ cor - meas ] suppose that @xmath74 is @xmath40-regular for @xmath41 and the random variables at the vertices are i.i.d.with the distribution @xmath75 for @xmath76 , where the digits @xmath77 have uniform spacing : @xmath78 for some @xmath79 .",

    "* remarks . * 1 .",
    "looking at the @xmath3-th level , we see that @xmath25 is covered by @xmath85 intervals of size @xmath86 .",
    "thus , if @xmath87 , then @xmath25 has hausdorff dimension less than one and hence @xmath21 is singular ( surely , not just almost surely ) .",
    "corollary  [ cor2 ] shows that the a.s .",
    "properties of the stochastically self - similar measure @xmath21 and those of its deterministic counterpart are closely related .",
    "there is a heuristic principle that putting more randomness into the model increases the likelihood of absolute continuity . in our model",
    "the randomness is fairly `` mild , '' so that the number - theoretic phenomena associated with pisot numbers are preserved ( unlike the models in @xcite ) .",
    "corollary  [ cor2](ii ) opens a possibility of applications in the other direction ; although this may be far - fetched , any progress in the problem of determining precisely for which @xmath45 the bernoulli convolution measure is absolutely continuous ( see @xcite ) , would be interesting .    finally , we state a corollary which gives additional information for the most basic case @xmath88 and @xmath89 , using the results available for classical bernoulli convolutions . motivated by @xcite ,",
    "we say that @xmath84 is a _ garsia number _ if it is an algebraic integer whose minimal polynomial has all zeros greater than one in absolute value and the constant term @xmath90 .",
    "examples of such polynomials include @xmath91 for @xmath92 , @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 , etc . , see @xcite .",

    "it should be noted that the estimate in ( iii ) is the best known , but probably not the best possible .",
    "the reciprocals of pisot numbers are the only known parameters in @xmath106 for which the bernoulli convolution measure is singular .    in sections 3 and 4",
    "we study the topological properties of the support , restricting ourselves to the case of the binary tree and uniform bernoulli ( 2-digit ) random variables , as in the beginning of the introduction . here",
    "the case of classical bernoulli convolutions can not serve as a guide , since for them the support of the measure is an interval whenever @xmath107 .",
    "it is more convenient to use the digits @xmath108 rather than @xmath38 ( this is obtained by a linear change of variables ) .",

    "this is due to @xmath116 and the fact that every @xmath117 has an expansion in base @xmath45 with digits 0,1 .",
    "the expansion is , in general , non - unique , so the condition for @xmath115 is only sufficient . for @xmath117",

    "the questions about `` hitting '' a given subset of the sequence space by infinite words seen along the paths of a tree for a tree - indexed process were considered by many authors .",
    "a set is called _ nonpolar _ or _ polar _ according to whether or not it is hit with positive probability .",
