    "the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) seeks to derive from observed samples and surveys of radio sources , their space density per unit co - moving volume and how this changes with source luminosity .",
    "it is an essential input to both gravitational lensing studies which probe cosmic geometry ( e.g. kochanek 1996 ) and modelling of the clustering of radio sources ( magliocchetti et al .",
    "the rlf derived at low radio frequencies is important for understanding the content of high frequency surveys and hence deriving jet beaming parameters ( e.g. jackson & wall 1999 ) . the shape and evolution of the rlf provide important constraints on the nature of radio activity in massive galaxies and its cosmic evolution .",
    "longair ( 1966 ) was one of the first to attempt to determine the evolution of the radio source population . at that time",
    "there were very few radio source redshifts known and the main constraint upon his models came from the low  frequency source counts down to @xmath7 jy .",
    "longair found that the data were best - fit by models where the most powerful radio sources undergo greater cosmic evolution ( in comoving space density @xmath1 ) than less - powerful sources .",
    "the subsequent acquisition of a substantial fraction of the redshifts for the 3crr complete sample of laing , riley & longair ( 1983 ) enabled the evolution to be better constrained . using the @xmath8 test ( see section [ vvmax ] )",
    "they concluded that the most powerful radio sources undergo substantial evolution with similar evolution for both powerful radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "unfortunately , the tight correlation between radio luminosity and redshift in this sample meant that they were unable to make any progress on the form of the evolving rlf .",
    "wall , pearson & longair ( 1980 ) suggested that complete samples a factor of @xmath9 times fainter than the 3crr sample would be necessary to differentiate between possible models of the rlf .",
    "the most comprehensive study of the radio luminosity function prior to this work was performed by dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ; hereafter dp90 ) .",
    "using several complete samples selected at 2.7 ghz with lower flux - limits ranging from 2.0 jy to 0.1 jy , they considered the flat- and steep - spectrum populations separately and derived the rlf for each population .",
    "their constraints on the rlf of flat - spectrum sources were somewhat tighter than those derived by peacock ( 1985 ) , but the major breakthrough of their paper concerned the constraints they were able to place on the rlf of steep - spectrum radio sources .",
    "the strong positive evolution in @xmath1 with @xmath0 out to @xmath4 inferred by longair ( 1966 ) , wall et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and laing et al .",
    "( 1983 ) was mapped out in some detail , and more controversially their results indicated a decline in the co - moving number density of both populations beyond a redshift of @xmath10  the so - called ` redshift cut  off ' .",
    "dp90 concluded that for powerful sources a model of pure luminosity evolution ( ple  evolution only of the break luminosity with redshift , analogous to that of boyle , shanks & peterson 1988 for the quasar optical luminosity function ) fitted the data well ( but only for @xmath11 ) .",
    "a similar model which incorporates negative density evolution at high  redshift ( the lde model ) was found to work well for both @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "a recent update on the dp90 work can be found in dunlop ( 1998 ) , and a critical re - evaluation of the evidence for a redshift cut  off in the flat - spectrum population can be found in jarvis & rawlings ( 2000 ) .",
    "derivations of the luminosity functions of luminous agn selected at all frequencies ( radio , optical and x - ray ) have shown a broken power - law form with a steeper slope at the high  luminosity end than at the low luminosity end ( e.g. dp90 , boyle et al .",
    "1988 , page et al .",
    "these studies were also able to adequately describe the positive evolution of the luminosity function from @xmath13 to @xmath14 by assuming pure luminosity evolution .",
    "more recent studies with different datasets have shown some deviations from ple ( e.g. goldschmidt & miller 1998 , miyaji , hasinger & schmidt 2000 ) .",
    "the physical rationale behind ple is that the agn have long lifetimes ( comparable with the hubble time ) and they decline in luminosity from @xmath15 to @xmath13 .",
    "however , at least in the case of the high  luminosity radio population , we know such a model is not viable because the ages of frii radio sources in the surveys are well - constrained to be @xmath16 a few @xmath17 yr ( e.g. blundell , rawlings & willott 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , for x - ray and optically - selected quasars , accretion at the rates required for their high luminosities ( over a hubble time ) would lead to much more massive black holes than are observed in the local universe ( e.g. cavaliere & padovani 1989 ) .",
    "thus , although ple models do fit the gross features of the data , the physical basis of these models is not clear .",
    "the radio source population is composed of several seemingly different types of object .",
    "one division between types is concerned with radio structure which falls into two distinct classes : fri , or ` twin - jet ' , sources ; and frii , or ` classical double ' , sources ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) . at low luminosities",
    "@xmath18 , the vast majority of sources have an fri radio structure ( apart from the very low luminosity starbursts ) , whilst at higher luminosities the majority of sources have frii structure .",
    "a second division is concerned with the optical properties of the population . at @xmath19 the fraction of objects in low  frequency selected samples with observed broad - line nuclei changes rapidly from @xmath20 at higher radio luminosities to @xmath21 at lower luminosities ( willott et al .",
    "it is not yet clear whether this represents a fundamental change in central engine properties because , for example , it could be due to the opening angle of an obscuring torus increasing with decreasing luminosity ( see willott et al .",
    "however , it is clear that at least some frii sources lack even indirect evidence for an active quasar nucleus because , as pointed out by hine & longair ( 1979 ) and laing et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , they have weak or absent emission lines . indeed it is plausible that the majority of frii radio galaxies ( per unit comoving volume ) show passive elliptical - galaxy spectra ( rixon , wall & benn 1991 ) and are part of the low ",
    "luminosity population considered here .    in this paper",
    "we have chosen to investigate the rlf in terms of a dual - population model where the less radio - luminous population is composed of fris and friis with weak / absent emission lines , and the more radio - luminous population of strong - line frii radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "our motivation for doing this is that the presence / absence of a quasar nucleus , as indicated by emission line strength , is a distinction intimately connected to the properties of the central engine , whereas radio structure is strongly influenced by the larger - scale environment ( e.g. kaiser & alexander 1997 ) .",
    "the critical radio luminosity [ @xmath22 which crudely divides the populations is also very close to the break in the rlf ( e.g. from dp90 ) , whereas the luminosity of the fri / frii divide is clearly well below the break .",
    "tentative evidence for an increase in the fraction of quasars with redshift from @xmath13 to @xmath23 can then be explained if this low ",
    "luminosity population evolves less rapidly than the high  luminosity population ( willott et al .",
    "the @xmath1 of fri sources is already known to evolve less - strongly with @xmath0 than that of the radio - luminous friis ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) , but here we will assume that this is because they are a sub - set of a larger population of low  luminosity radio sources , including friis , which evolve less strongly .",
    "we will show that differential evolution between the two populations mimics ple to a certain extent , but with a more plausible physical basis .",
    "padovani & urry ( 1992 ) , urry & padovani ( 1995 ) and jackson & wall ( 1999 ) have adopted a different approach to determining the rlf from high  frequency complete samples . instead of separating the flat- and steep - spectrum sources and deriving the rlf for each population , they use models built around unified schemes and relativistic beaming to determine the relative fractions of various classes of objects in the samples .",
    "their models assume that bl lac objects are the beamed versions of fri and ( in the case of jackson & wall ) weak - line frii radio galaxies , and that flat - spectrum quasars are favourably oriented frii radio galaxies .",
    "however , both these analyses required the rlf of unbeamed objects to be determined independently , i.e from low  frequency samples . because they used only the 3crr sample to determine the luminosity distribution of radio sources , the tight @xmath24 correlation meant a degeneracy between luminosity and redshift effects",
    "current models of this type are thus most useful for constraining the values of various beaming parameters and how these affect the population mix in high  frequency selected samples , and have not provided new information on the evolution of steep - spectrum sources .",
    "in this paper we present a new investigation of the steep - spectrum rlf which combines the bright 3crr sample with the new , fainter 6ce and 7crs redshift surveys ( based on the 6c and 7c radio surveys , respectively ) .",
    "note that an investigation of the rlf of steep - spectrum quasars ( based on the 3crr and 7crs samples ) has been presented by willott et al .",
    "1998 ( w98 ) . as the basis for an investigation of the steep - spectrum rlf , the 3crr/6ce/7crs dataset improves on that used by dp90 in four different ways .    *   * spectroscopic completeness .",
    "* many of the sources in the dp90 samples do not have spectroscopic redshifts [ including , at the time of dp90 , @xmath25 of the sources in their faintest sample  the parkes selected regions ( psr ) ] , and redshifts had to be estimated from the infrared hubble diagram ( the @xmath26 relation ) .",
    "dunlop ( 1998 ) reports that further spectroscopy of these sources has shown their redshifts tended to be overestimated ( due to the positive correlation between radio luminosity and @xmath27-band luminosity , eales et al .",
    "1997 ) , which he contends strengthens the dp90 evidence for a redshift cut  off in high  frequency selected samples .",
    "however , as we discuss later ( section 5.1 ) , the assignment of systematically high redshifts to many sources may in fact have caused dp90 to overestimate the strength of any redshift cut  off .",
    "in contrast to the psr , the 6ce and 7crs have virtually complete spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "*   * coverage of the radio luminosity versus @xmath0 plane . *",
    "the flux - limit of the psr is @xmath28 jy . for steep - spectrum sources with @xmath29 ,",
    "this corresponds to @xmath30 jy , and for @xmath31 to @xmath32 jy , so the 7c redshift survey ( 7crs ) with a flux - limit of @xmath33 jy is a factor @xmath34 times deeper at a given @xmath0 than the psr depending on spectral index .",
    "because of the correlations between @xmath35 and radio luminosity and @xmath0 ( e.g. blundell et al . 1999 ) this makes the 7crs sensitive to lower radio luminosity objects at the higher redshifts .",
    "note that because the psr covers an area 3.5 times larger than the 7crs , the two samples actually contain similar numbers of high  redshift objects .",
    "*   * radio completeness .",
    "* dp90 found the source counts in the psr at 0.1 jy to be a factor of two lower than expected from the source counts at other frequencies .",
    "they suggested that this is due to incompleteness in the original survey near its flux - limit , although this is by no means certain ( j.v . wall , priv .",
    "comm . ) . although they attempted to correct for this ,",
    "there remains some possibility of bias : methods based on the @xmath36 statistic are particularly sensitive to such problems , as objects close to the flux - limit have @xmath37 , and losing such objects would bias the statistic towards a spuriously low value .",
    "the 6ce sample and the 7crs are based on surveys which are complete at the flux - densities of interest .",
    "as riley ( 1989 ) discusses , the number of large angular size sources omitted from surveys such as these due to surface brightness effects is likely to be negligible .",
    "*   * benefits of low  frequency selection*. the ultimate goal of our programme is to model the evolution in the rlf of steep - spectrum sources . as detailed in blundell",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) , the physics of frii radio sources means that the mapping between radio luminosity and one of the key physical variables , the bulk power in the jets , is much closer if the radio luminosity is evaluated at low rest - frame frequencies provided , of course , these lie above the synchrotron self - absorption frequency of a given source .",
    "modelling of high frequency luminosity is much more problematic , both because lobe emission at these frequencies is highly sensitive to source age and redshift ( because of inverse - compton scattering of lobe electrons by the microwave background ) , and because doppler - boosted cores and hotspots become much more important at high rest - frame frequencies .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the data available to constrain the steep - spectrum rlf .",
    "section 3 describes the model fitting procedures and results . in section 4",
    "the evolution of the radio source population is tested via the @xmath8 statistic .",
    "section 5 compares our findings with those of previous rlf determinations . in section 6",
    "we summarise our results and indicate the future work necessary to resolve the outstanding uncertainties .",
    "the convention for the radio spectral index , @xmath38 , is that @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the flux - density at frequency @xmath41 .",
    "we assume throughout that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "all results are presented for both flat ( @xmath44 ) and open ( @xmath45 ) cosmologies .",
    "the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) is defined as the number of radio sources per unit co - moving volume per unit ( base 10 ) logarithm of luminosity , @xmath46 . to determine the rlf",
    ", we will make use of three different types of radio data : complete samples with spectroscopic redshifts ; source counts ; and a low  redshift sample to fix the local rlf .",
    "= 0.9      a complete sample consists of every radio source in a certain area on the sky brighter than a specified flux - limit at the selection frequency .",
    "if all these sources are identified optically with a galaxy or quasar and redshifts are determined , then the distribution of points on the @xmath47 plane , together with knowledge of the sample flux - limits and sky areas , in principle allow the determination of the rlf . the major uncertainty in such a determination is that at least some regions of the @xmath47 plane will be very sparsely populated , and at these @xmath48 and @xmath0 the rlf measurement will be prone to small number statistical uncertainties .",
    "these typically arise because the identification of and/or redshift acquisition of faint radio sources can be very time - consuming , and due to the limited nature of time available at large telescopes , complete samples up until now have generally been limited to @xmath49 sources",
    ". some regions of the @xmath47 plane are prone to a more fundamental problem : objects of a given @xmath48 may be sufficiently rare that there is simply too little observable comoving volume at the redshift of interest to obtain large samples .",
    "our dataset of redshift surveys combines three low  frequency complete samples with different flux - limits , which together provide unparalleled coverage of the @xmath50 plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : allpz ] ) .",

    ", it is expected to contain few flat - spectrum ( @xmath52 ) sources . from inspection of the vla maps and radio spectra , sources which only have flux - densities above the sample limit due to their doppler - boosted cores can be identified . out of the total of 130 sources",

    "[ sec : intro ] , the rlf is modelled here as a combination of two populations which are allowed to have different rlf shapes and evolutionary properties . the low ",
    "luminosity radio source population ( composed of fris and low ",
    "excitation / weak emission line friis ) is modelled with a schechter function , @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the source number density as a function of radio luminosity @xmath48 , @xmath113 is a normalisation term , @xmath114 is the break luminosity and @xmath115 is the power - law slope .",
    "the evolution function of @xmath116 is modelled as @xmath117 up to a maximum redshift @xmath118 beyond which there is no further evolution .",
    "hence there are five free parameters to be fixed for the low  luminosity population .    for the high  luminosity population a similar form is adopted , except in this case the exponential part of the schechter function is at low luminosity and the power - law region is at high luminosity , i.e. @xmath119 where the subscript h refers to the high luminosity population .",
    "note that it is expected that @xmath120 , so that at this luminosity the decline in one population is compensated by the rise of the other , since no discontinuity or bi - modality in the rlf has yet been observed ( e.g. dp90 ) .",
    "these forms for the luminosity functions of the two populations were chosen because the steep exponentials ensured a fairly small overlap in @xmath121 between the two populations . however , we currently have little information about the relative population fractions in the overlap region , so this is just a convenient method of separating the populations .",
    "we note that the low - luminosity rlf of our model has a similar shape to the elliptical galaxy @xmath27-band luminosity ( and therefore mass ) function ( e.g. gardner et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the high  luminosity population is assumed to undergo density evolution of a similar form to that of the quasar rlf in w98 .",
    "the @xmath0-distribution @xmath122 is given by a gaussian in redshift ( model a here ) , with a variant on this distribution being a one - tailed gaussian from zero redshift to the peak redshift and then a constant density to high  redshift ( model b  also known as the ` no cut  off ' model since there is no redshift cut  off ) .",
    "note that the gaussian model a is a convenient approximation to the shape of the evolution of luminous optically - selected quasars ( e.g. warren , hewett & osmer 1994 ) , and to the evolution inferred for flat - spectrum radio sources by shaver et al .",
    "( 1999 )  but see jarvis & rawlings ( 2000 ) for a contrary view .",
    "there is no physical reason why one would expect the evolution to be symmetric in redshift . in w98",
    "we showed that the gaussian redshift distribution from @xmath13 to the peak is very similar to the form @xmath123 , so we do not include models with this form of evolution here .",
    "in w98 it was found that both these redshift distributions ( models a and b in this paper ) provided good fits because the number of quasars in the samples at high  redshift was fairly small .",
    "the inclusion of the 6ce and 7c - iii samples and the 7crs radio galaxies gives a much larger sample of @xmath124 objects here than for the quasar rlf .",
    "hence , the high redshift evolution can be better determined .",
    "therefore , an additional redshift distribution is tested here , which has a one - tailed gaussian rise to the peak redshift and then a one - tailed gaussian decline at higher redshifts which is allowed to have a different width from the rise .",
    "this allows more shallow high  redshift declines in @xmath125 ( such as that inferred by dp90 ) than the symmetric model a. this model ( c ) directly fits the strength of any decline in the co - moving density beyond the peak redshift @xmath126 , since the value of the high  redshift gaussian width @xmath127 is free to be fit from 0 for an abrupt cut  off to a large value for a very gradual decline at high  redshift .",

    "if these sources are actually at systematically lower redshifts then this explains why dp90 observe an excess of @xmath124 sources . extrapolating this high source density up to @xmath209",
    "then predicts many sources in no cut  off models .",
    "note that because few of their redshift estimates were actually in the region of supposed decline ( at @xmath167 ) the redshift over - estimation has the opposite effect to the naive expectation that this new information strengthens claims for the redshift cut  off . thus we have an explanation as to why dp90 find stronger evidence for a steep - spectrum redshift cut  off than we find with the 3crr , 6ce and 7crs datasets ( having virtually complete spectroscopic redshifts ) .",

    "the banded @xmath8 test suffers significantly from large statistical errors when only a few sources are left in the samples at the highest redshifts , and this tends to limit its usefulness in practice .",

    "et al . ( 2000 ) we showed that the fraction of quasars in the high luminosity population is 0.4 .",
    "therefore one would expect a very similar rlf to that of the quasars in w98 , with an increase in number density of @xmath213 .",

    "the peak for the high  luminosity schechter function is at approximately the same luminosity ( @xmath214 ) as the break required by the source counts for the quasar rlf .",
    "the quasar rlf of w98 had a flat slope below this break , whereas the models of this paper have very rapid declines with decreasing luminosity .",
    "if the models described here are correct , then the quasar rlf should also have this schechter function form .",
    "a survey at fainter flux - limits would probe the break region at high  redshift and hopefully constrain the number of quasars ( or blrgs ) at lower radio luminosities .",

    "( 1999 ) , however incompleteness arising from the bright optical limit of this sample ( as discussed by w98 ) will complicate attempts to make quantitative estimates of the shape of the rlf at and below the break luminosity .",
    "using low  frequency selected radio samples with virtually complete redshift information , we have investigated the form of the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) and its evolution .",
    "our results are generally in good agreement with previous work by dp90 ( fig.[fig : dprlf ] ) and w98 ( fig .",

    "low luminosity objects exhibit a gradual [ @xmath217 from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ] rise in @xmath1 with @xmath0 which matches the rise seen in the rate of global star formation ( e.g. boyle & terlevich 1998 ; franceschini et al .",

    "a fundamental limitation is that both our complete samples and those previously studied by dp90 include only a few sources with @xmath63 ( e.g. just 12 in 3c/6ce/7crs ) , so small number statistics are a huge problem in assessing the evidence for or against a redshift cut  off .",

    "significant progress on fainter radio samples is however achievable .",
    "the choice of the flux - density level at which to concentrate efforts for the next large redshift survey is clearly crucial .",
    "we believe that the vital factor is being able to efficiently probe objects at or just above the break in the high  luminosity rlf at high  redshift .",
    "the reason for this is that integration of @xmath221 over the rlfs plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : allrlf ] shows that about @xmath222 of the luminosity density of the radio population at @xmath223 lies in the narrow luminosity range @xmath224 .",

    "[ fig : pzend ] shows flux - limits in the @xmath225 plane for various samples with this luminosity range shaded .",
    "the plot illustrates that @xmath226 jy is therefore the natural choice for a new large redshift survey .",

    "[ fig : pzend ] shows that they would become completely dominated by the low ",
    "luminosity population ,    to investigate the likely content of a @xmath227 jy redshift survey , we have used models a , b and c rlfs to predict redshift distributions for a hypothetical 1000-source survey ( fig .  [",

    "note that all models assume that the evolution of the low ",
    "luminosity population freezes at @xmath3 .",
    "the first thing to notice is that the low ",
    "luminosity population dominates the total number of predicted sources in the case of @xmath199 , whereas in the @xmath141 case the two populations become approximately equal .",
    "this same result can be seen in the source counts plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : scects ] , and arises because the low ",
    "luminosity rlf is currently constrained only at low ",
    "redshift , and the ratio of high to low ",
    "redshift available volume is much larger in a low@xmath228 universe .",
    "thus , although a large fraction of the sources will be at @xmath229 , we predict that in a low@xmath228 universe in which evolution of the low ",
    "luminosity population freezes at @xmath3 , of order 50 % of the sources will be in the high  luminosity population and lie at high  redshift , irrespective of the strength of the redshift cut  off",
    ". this should make determination of the evolution in the luminosity density a rather straightforward process .",
    "there should be no longer be a problem of small number statistics , at least at @xmath230 . adopting model c , 7% ( 5% ) of a hypothetical 1000-source redshift survey would lie at @xmath231 for @xmath140 ( or @xmath141 ) , whereas the same model predicts 3% ( 2% ) for a survey like the 7crs .    the pronounced high  redshift tail in the case of ` no - cut  off ' model b in fig .",
    "[ fig : nz0_1 ] should be easily refutable with a 1000-source redshift survey at @xmath227 jy . for the symmetric - decline model a ( and @xmath140 ) one would expect about 35 @xmath231 sources in such a sample , whereas for model b we would expect 130 .",
    "indeed , dunlop ( 1998 ) has already claimed to have ruled out the no - cut  off case using indirect constraints on the redshift distribution of a lbds ( leiden - berkeley deep survey ) sample flux - limited at @xmath232 mjy , or @xmath233 mjy .",
    "we note from fig .",
    "[ fig : pzend ] that such a sample will be overwhelmingly dominated by the low  luminosity population , and hence is too deep to provide optimal constraint on the evolution of the luminosity density of the rlf .",
    "although , as we shall argue below , indirect evidence favours a gentle decline in @xmath1 at high  redshift , dunlop s argument in favour of a redshift cut ",
    "off is not water  tight .",
    "it is currently predicated on an extrapolation between two samples , the psr and the lbds sample , neither of which is close to spectroscopic completeness , and which are separated by two orders of magnitude in flux - density ; at high  redshift the psr and lbds sources lie on either side of the range in @xmath121 which is key to delineating the evolution of the luminosity density of the radio source population with redshift .",
    "an alternative approach to obtaining complete redshift information for large samples is to refine the sample selection criteria to exclude the large numbers of low  redshift sources .",
    "this is being attempted by several groups using spectral index and/or linear size criteria ( e.g. bremer et al . 1998 ; blundell et al .",
    "1998 ; rawlings et al . 1998",
    "; de breuck et al . 2000 )",
    ". however , the numbers of high@xmath0 sources which are missed in these samples are uncertain , so they will always struggle to prove the existence of a redshift cut  off , although they can place a lower limit on the space density ( jarvis et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "another alternative approach is to study the evolution of flat - spectrum radio sources .",
    "jarvis & rawlings ( 2000 ) have recently critically re - evaluated evidence in this area ( peacock 1985 ; dp90 ; shaver et al .",
    "1996 ; shaver et al . 1999 ) and concluded that constant-@xmath1 models for the most luminous flat - spectrum sources can be ruled out at the @xmath234 level .",
    "they favour a decline in @xmath1 for these objects by a factor @xmath235 between @xmath236 and @xmath139 , i.e. behaviour intermediate between models b and c considered in this paper .",
