    "in recent years there is a renewed interest to the mathematical status of the replica method widely used in disordered systems during last four decades . for the calculation of thermodynamic quantities averaged over disorder parameters ( e.g. average free energy ) the method assumes , first , calculation of the averages of an integer @xmath0-th power of the partition function @xmath1 , and second , analytic continuation of this function in the replica parameter @xmath0 from integer to arbitrary non - integer values ( and in particular , taking the limit @xmath2 ) .",
    "usually one is facing difficulties at both stages of this program .",
    "first of all , in realistic disordered systems the calculations of the replica partition function @xmath1 can be done only using some kind of approximations , and in this case the status of further analytic continuation in the replica parameter @xmath0 becomes rather indefinite since the terms neglected at integer @xmath0 could become essential at non - integer @xmath0 ( in particular the limit @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "the typical example of such type of trouble is provided by the classical kardar s solution of @xmath3 directed polymers in random potential where due to the approximation used at the first stage of calculations ( when the parameter @xmath0 is still integer ) the resulting free energy distribution function appears to be not positively defined @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . on the other hand , even in rare cases",
    "when the derivation of the replica partition function @xmath1 can be done exactly , further analytic continuation to non - integer @xmath0 appears to be ambiguous .",
    "the classical example of this situation is provided by the derrida s random energy model ( rem ) in which the momenta @xmath1 growths as @xmath4 at large @xmath0 , and in this case there are many different distributions yielding the same values of @xmath1 , but providing _ different _ values for the average free energy of the system @xcite . performing `` direct '' analytic continuation to non - integer @xmath0 ( just assuming that the parameter @xmath0 in the obtained expression for @xmath1 can take arbitrary real values ) , one finds the so called replica symmetric ( rs ) solution which turns out to be correct at high temperatures , but which is apparently wrong ( it provides negative entropy ) in the low temperature ( spin - glass ) phase . in the case of rem",
    "the situation is sufficiently simple because here one can check what is right and what is wrong comparing with the available exact solution ( which can be derived without replicas ) .",
    "unfortunately in other systems the status of the results obtained by the replica method is much less clear .    in the case of the mean - field spin - glasses",
    "@xcite the replica partition function also growths as @xmath4 at large @xmath0 , and its `` direct '' analytic continuation to non - integer @xmath0 , as in rem , provides wrong rs solution in the low temperature spin - glass phase . here",
    "the solution which is generally _ believed _ to be correct is obtained via the parisi replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) scheme ( in the case of rem it reduces to the special case which is called one - step rsb ) , and it is derived in terms of a _",
    "heuristic _ procedure and not as a proper analytic continuation from integer to non integer values of @xmath0 of the replica partition function @xcite .",
    "recently the results obtained in terms of the rsb scheme has been confirmed by independent mathematically rigorous calculations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although no one seems to doubt now that the rsb heuristic procedure provide correct results , the problem is that until now no one was able to explain , _ why _ it provides correct results ?",
    "presumably the most notable progress in the studies of the subtleties of the replica method has been achieved recently in the context of the random matrix theory , where the remarkable exact relation between replica partition functions and painlev transcendents has been proved @xcite .",
    "one can also mention here recent exact replica solution for one - dimensional directed polymers in random potential , which ( unlike all previous examples ) _ did not _",
    "involve an analytic continuation from integer to non - integer replica parameter @xmath0 and where the results obtained were also expressed in terms of the painlev transcendents @xcite .    in this paper",
    "i would like to consider two examples of the systematic replica field theory calculations using very simple random systems for which , at first sight , every step of the replica program is under control .",
    "it turns out , however , that even in these extremely simple cases the derivation of the physical results inevitably requires the usual replica method `` cheating '' ( the advantage of the simple system is that here one can easily see how it goes ) . of course , it is not that present research explains something deep about the replica method .",
    "the aim of the paper is ( once again ) to turn the attention to the existing paradoxes , and to promote ( once again ) the idea that `` something has to be done '' : it looks rather uncomfortable that on one hand we have extremely robust method , which in most of the cases works perfectly well , while on the other hand , we do not understand _ why _ it works .",
    "the `` toy '' models considered in this paper are `` extracted '' from the one - dimensional directed polymers in a quenched random potential ( for the detailed physical analysis of the obtained results see @xcite ) .",
    "these systems describe an elastic string directed along the @xmath5-axis within an interval @xmath6 $ ] with displacements defined by the scalar field @xmath7 having the elastic energy density proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "randomness enters the problem through a disorder potential @xmath9 $ ] competing against the elastic energy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the problem then is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath10 = \\int_{0}^{l } dx     \\bigl\\{\\frac{1}{2 } \\bigl[\\partial_x \\phi(x)\\bigr]^2      + v[\\phi(x),x]\\bigr\\};\\ ] ] the disorder potential @xmath9 $ ] is gaussian distributed with a zero mean @xmath11 and a correlator @xmath12 which is defined by a correlation function @xmath13 .",
    "the above equation implies that the random potential correlations are `` translation invariant '' in the @xmath14 direction depending only on the difference @xmath15 .",
    "general strategy of the replica calculations for this system is in the following . for the string with the zero boundary conditions at @xmath16 the partition function of a given sample is @xmath17 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } dy \\int_{\\phi(0)=0}^{\\phi(l)=y }                 { \\cal d } [ \\phi(x ) ]   \\ ;   \\mbox{\\large e}^{-\\beta h[\\phi , v]}\\ ] ] where the integration goes over all trajectories @xmath7 staring at the origin , and @xmath18 denotes the inverse temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the partition function is related to the total free energy @xmath19 $ ] via @xmath20 = \\exp ( -\\beta   f[v])\\ ] ] the free energy @xmath19 $ ] is defined for a specific realization of the random potential @xmath21 and thus represent a random variable .",
    "let us take the @xmath0-th power of both sides of eq.([1gdp4 ] ) and perform the averaging over the random potential @xmath21 : @xmath22 = \\overline{\\biggl(\\exp ( -\\beta n f[v ] ) \\biggr)}\\ ] ] the quantity in the l.h.s of the above equation @xmath23 \\equiv \\overline{\\bigl(z[v]\\bigr)^{n}}\\ ] ] is called the replica partition function , and it is defined originally for an arbitrary _ integer _",
    "parameter @xmath0 .",
    "let us suppose that at large @xmath24 the fluctuating free energy of the system scales with the system size as @xmath25 , i.e. it is characterized by a single universal exponent @xmath26 .",
    "redefining @xmath27 , we introduce a random quantity @xmath28 which can be described by a distribution function @xmath29 ( depending on the system size @xmath24 ) . in this way , instead of eq.([1gdp5 ] ) we get the following general relation between the replica partition function @xmath30 $ ] and the distribution function of the ( rescaled ) free energy fluctuations @xmath29 : @xmath31 \\ ; = \\ ;             \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } df \\ , { \\cal p}_{l } ( f ) \\ ;               \\mbox{\\large e}^ { -\\beta n   l^{\\omega } \\ , f}\\ ] ] the above equation is the bilateral laplace transform of the function @xmath29 , and at least formally it allows to restore this function in terms of the replica partition function @xmath30 $ ] . in order to do",
    "so we have to compute @xmath30 $ ] for an _ arbitrary _ integer @xmath0 and then ( if the result would permit ! ) perform analytical continuation of this function from integer to arbitrary complex values of @xmath0 . introducing a new _ complex _ variable @xmath32 and denoting @xmath33 \\equiv z_{l}(s)\\ ] ] instead of eq.([1gdp7 ] ) we get @xmath34 according to this relation the distribution function @xmath29",
    "can be reconstructed via the inverse laplace transform @xmath35 where the integration goes over the contour parallel to the imaginary axis .",
    "finally , provided there are exist a _",
    "finite _ thermodynamic limit function @xmath36 we can find the distribution function @xmath37 which would describe the statistics of the rescaled free energy fluctuations @xmath38 in the infinite system .",
    "the above equation defining @xmath39 contains no parameters and hence is expected to be universal .",
    "note also that according to the relation @xmath40 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath41 the relevant values of the replica parameter @xmath42 , which explains why the two limits @xmath41 and @xmath2 do not commute @xcite .    usually the problem formulated in eqs.([1gdp1])-([1gdp2 ] ) is studied in the context of the short - range correlated disorder potential , i.e. , for a rapidly decaying function @xmath43 ( which for simplicity is often replaced by the @xmath44-function ) in this case the free energy fluctuations scale as @xmath45 @xcite . on the other hand , if we would like to study the statistics of _ small _ string displacements we could develop the random potential @xmath46 $ ] in powers of @xmath47 keeping the first two terms only : @xmath48 \\simeq v_{0}(x ) + v_{1}(x ) \\ ; \\phi\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the gaussian uncorrelated random parameters with the zero mean , @xmath51 , and the correlators @xmath52 which implies that unlike eq.([1gdp2 ] ) , the random potential correlator is _ not _ translation invariant : @xmath53\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this way , instead of eq.([1gdp1 ] ) we arrive to the hamiltonian @xmath54 = \\int_{0}^{l } dx     \\bigl\\{\\frac{1}{2 } \\bigl[\\partial_x \\phi(x)\\bigr]^2      + v_{1}(x ) \\phi(x ) + v_{0}(x)\\bigr\\};\\ ] ] now , lifting the requirement @xmath47 , we are getting simple gaussian random force model to be studied in this paper by the replica method ( section ii ) .    the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "@xmath41 , of this system has been studied earlier @xcite . here",
    "i would like to concentrate on the thechnical details of the calculations .",
    "due to apperent simplicity of the model the replica trick calculations can be followed here step by step from the very begining till the very end . in this way",
    "it can be easily demonstrated that _ formally _ at sertain stage of the calculations the implementation of the replica program ( as it is declared at the very begining ) is just impossible . on the other hand , following the usual `` doublethink '' traditions of the replica calculations in disordered systems ( i.e. closing eyes on the fact that certain suggestions used in the calculations contradict to each other ) one can easily fulfill the programme till the very end to obtain very nice and physically sensible result for the free energy distribution function .",
    "moreover , in this particular case we can be sure that the result obtained in this way is indeed _ correct _ , as it can also be derived via direct calculations without replicas @xcite .",
    "it turns out that regardless of the apparent simplicity of the model , its free energy distribution function ( which will be derived here for an arbitrary finite system size @xmath24 ) is rather non - trivial .",
    "in section iii we consider slightly modified version of the above `` toy '' system .",
    "namely , instead of developing the random potential itself , eq.([1gdp13 ] ) , one can consider the development of its _ correlation function _",
    "@xmath13 , eq.([1gdp2 ] )",
    ". again , keeping the first two terms only , one gets @xmath55 ( which , unlike eq.([1gdp15 ] ) , would preserve the translation invariance of the random potential correlations ) .",
    "it turns out that this , seemingly rather innocent modification provokes quite dramatic consequences . as",
    "before , we lift the requirement @xmath47 and accept the above `` truncated '' correlation function , eq.([1gdp17 ] ) , as valid for the whole range of the scalar fields @xmath7 . then , in the result of the standard replica calculations ( which again inevitably involve the same cheeting as in the case of the previous model ) we find that the corresponding free energy distribution function is _ not positively defined _ , which , of course , makes no physical sense .",
    "the point of this little methodological ( and pedagogical ) exercise is to demonstrate that it is not the replicas which are always responsible for all the troubles in the disordered systems world .",
    "in fact , the result of the replica calculations honestly reproduces the pathological nature of the original model itself : due to approximation , eq.([1gdp17 ] ) , we obtain the replica theory which does not correspond to any physical system .",
    "one can show that there exists no ( positively defined ) gaussian distribution function of the random potentials @xmath46 $ ] which would provide the correlation function , eqs.([1gdp2 ] ) , in the `` parabolic '' form , eq.([1gdp17 ] ) . moreover",
    ", the proper definition of the disorder potential is subject to important general constraints @xcite regarding the shape of the correlation function @xmath13 , and neglection of these constraints may lead to unphysical results .",
    "indeed , consider a random potential @xmath56 and its fourier representation @xmath57 .",
    "then the gaussian distribution function of the random function @xmath58 has the form @xmath59 = p_0 \\exp\\bigl(-\\int \\frac{dp}{2\\pi}\\ ,     \\frac{|\\tilde{v}(p)|^2}{2 g(p)}\\bigr);\\ ] ] where the _ positive _ function @xmath60 is related with the correlation function @xmath13 via @xmath61 expanding both sides of the above relation in powers of @xmath14 , @xmath62 we can compare coefficients : the @xmath63-th derivative of @xmath13 in the origin relates to the integral @xmath64 which is a positive quantity .",
    "hence , we have to be careful in our choice of the correlator @xmath13 : if we truncate the expansion of @xmath13 beyond some @xmath65 , such that @xmath66 for @xmath67 , we impose the condition @xmath68 which can not be satisfied for a positively defined @xmath60 . obviously , choosing the correlator @xmath13 , in the `` parabolic '' form , eq.([1gdp17 ] ) is in severe conflict with this constraint .",
    "if nevertheless , we would substitute such a parabolic correlator into the replica hamiltonian and perform all the standard calculations , first we would see no apparent indications telling that something went wrong .",
    "moreover , one can easily calculate the average free energy of this system to discover that it perfectly coincides with the one of the ( physically consistent ) random force model , eq.([1gdp16 ] ) .",
    "the trouble appears in the calculation of more specific quantities .",
    "for example , the second cumulant of free energy fluctuations turns out to be negative which makes no physical sense . including the next term @xmath69 in the correlator s expansion can cure this problem",
    ", however , an inconsistency then shows up in the next order cumulants , etc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we perform detailed analycis of the systematic replica field theory calculations for the random force model , eq.([1gdp16 ] ) , and present the results for its free energy distribution function . in section iii similar solution is considered for the `` parabolic '' directed polymer problem described by the correlation function , eq.([1gdp17 ] ) , providing not positively defined free energy distribution function .",
    "finally , the subtleties of the replica method are discussed in section iv .",
    "explicitly , the replica partition function , eq.([1gdp6 ] ) , of the system described by the hamiltonian , eq.([1gdp16 ] ) , is    @xmath70 ^ 2      + v_{1}(x ) \\phi_{a}(x ) + v_{0}(x )    \\bigr\\}\\biggr ] } \\ ] ]    since the random parameters @xmath50 and @xmath49 have gaussian distribution with correlations defined in eq.([1gdp14 ] ) , the disorder average @xmath71 in the above equation is very simple :    @xmath72 } \\ ; = \\ ;   \\exp\\biggl[\\frac{1}{2 } \\beta^{2 } \\int_{0}^{l } dx \\sum_{a , b=1}^{n } \\bigl\\ { u \\phi_{a}(x ) \\phi_{b}(x ) + v \\bigr\\}\\biggr]\\ ] ]    thus , the replica partition function , eq.([2gdp1 ] ) , can be represented in the following form @xmath73\\ ] ] where the `` wave function '' @xmath74 \\ ; = \\ ;   \\int_{\\phi_{a}(0)=0}^{\\phi_{a}(l)=y_{a } }      { \\cal d } \\phi_{a}(x ) \\ ;     \\exp\\bigl[-\\beta h_{n}[{\\boldsymbol \\phi } ]   \\bigr]\\ ] ] is defined by @xmath0-component scalar fields replica hamiltonian @xmath75 & = &       \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{0}^{l } dx \\biggl (     \\sum_{a=1}^{n } \\bigl[\\partial_x \\phi_{a}(x)\\bigr]^2      - \\beta u \\sum_{a , b}^{n } \\phi_{a}(x ) \\phi_{b}(x ) \\biggr )   \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   -\\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{0}^{l } dx \\sum_{a , b=1}^{n } \\phi_{a}(x ) \\ , u_{ab } \\ , \\phi_{b}(x ) \\label{2gdp5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath76 can be easily diagonalized .",

    "one can easily check that the solution of this equation satisfying the above initial condition is @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 where we have introduced the parameter @xmath99 it should be stressed that the above solution exists provided @xmath100 this restriction indicates that at a given value of the parameter @xmath101 the elastic string described by the partition function , eq.([2gdp16 ] ) ( which contains negative mass ! ) goes to infinity at the _ finite _ time @xmath102 .",
    "coming back to the original random force problem one can reformulate the above restriction in the other way : for a given system size ( `` time '' ) @xmath24 the corresponding replica partition function @xmath103 is defined only if @xmath104 at bigger values of @xmath0 the replica partition function is simply not defined ( it is formally divergent ) .",
    "taking into account that the quantity @xmath105 can be easily made less than one ( e.g. by taking @xmath24 sufficiently large ) , while the replica parameter @xmath0 is still should be kept positive integer , we see that the above restriction becomes the fatal point for the whole replica scheme of the calculations .",
    "of course , it is tempting to claim that since the replica @xmath0 enter the partition function , eq.([2gdp16 ] ) , in the form of the analytic parameter @xmath106 , we can analytically continue it to arbitrary real values in the interval @xmath107 , eq.([2gdp24 ] ) .",
    "but the problem is that the expression for the whole replica partition function , eqs.([2gdp3 ] ) , ( [ 2gdp14 ] ) , requires that the replica parameter @xmath0 _ must _ be still integer .",
    "in fact , the restriction , eq.([2gdp24 ] ) , reflects simple mathematical reality : the replica partition function @xmath103 of the considered system is divergent at @xmath108 . in particular , at @xmath109 , the replica partition function does no exist ( divergent ) for _ all _ integers @xmath110 . in this situation ( from the point of view of the common sense )",
    "the application of the replica method program for the system under consideration looks completely impossible .",
    "nevertheless , in terms of the _ modus vivendi _ of the replica method this problem is overcome in a very simple way .",
    "it is in this point that the `` doublethink '' begins : wherever the replica @xmath0 appears in a form of an analytic parameter it is immediately considered as real and belonging to the desired region ( @xmath2 in spin glasses , or @xmath107 in the present case ) , while _ at the same time _",
    "wherever @xmath0 can not made non - integer ( in the summations or in the products ) it is still considered as an integer ( note that similar , although slightly more sophisticated trick is used in the replica symmetry breaking construction ) .",

    "the replica partition function of directed polymers described by the hamiltonian ( [ 1gdp1 ] ) with non - local parabolic correlations of the random potentials , eq.([1gdp17 ] ) , can also be represented in the form of eqs.([2gdp3])-([2gdp4 ] ) with the replica hamiltonian @xmath161 & = &       \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{0}^{l } dx \\biggl (     \\sum_{a=1}^{n } \\bigl[\\partial_x \\phi_{a}(x)\\bigr]^2      + \\frac{1}{2 } \\beta u \\sum_{a , b}^{n } \\bigl[\\phi_{a}(x ) - \\phi_{b}(x ) \\bigr]^{2 } \\biggr )   \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   -\\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{0}^{l } dx \\sum_{a , b=1}^{n } \\phi_{a}(x ) \\ , \\tilde{u}_{ab } \\ , \\phi_{b}(x ) \\label{3gdp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the matrix @xmath162 following the same route as in the case of the random force model , eqs.([2gdp6])-([2gdp13 ] ) , we note that the above matrix has @xmath77-degenerate eigenvalue @xmath163 with @xmath77 orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath79 constrained by the condition @xmath164 , and one non - degenerate eigenvalue @xmath165 with the eigenvector @xmath166 . in terms of the new fields @xmath167 , the replica hamiltonian",

    "eq.([2gdp33 ] ) ) : @xmath174 performing ( numerical ) integration in the above equation one can easily find that this function is _ not positively defined _ for any values of the parameters @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "for example , in the zero temperature limit ( when @xmath177 ) the above equation reduces to ( cf .",
    "eq.([2gdp39 ] ) ) : @xmath178\\ ] ] the plot of this function for several values of the parameter @xmath151 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "we see that unlike @xmath29 ( figure 2 ) of the random force model , the function @xmath179 even at small @xmath24 ( large @xmath152 ) ( when it is almost gaussian ) has always a kind of the negalive `` kink '' at sufficiently large @xmath38 .",
    "unfortunately we are not able to confirm ( or reject ) the result , eq.([3gdp4 ] ) , by independent calculations , as the replica theory defined by the hamiltonian , eq.([3gdp1 ] ) , does not corresponds to any physical system ( see the discussion of this issue in the introduction , eqs.([1gdp18])-([1gdp21 ] ) ) . on the other hand , the clear lesson which we can learn from the exercise considered in this section ,",
    "is that unlike the `` honest cheating '' with the status of the replica parameter @xmath0 ( discussed in previous section ) , any _ approximations _ made at the stage of the replica calculations ( the exact correlator @xmath13 , eq.([1gdp2 ] ) , is replaced by its truncated expansion , eq.([1gdp17 ] ) ) could be just fatal for the physical meaning of the obtained results .     as it given by eq.([3gdp7 ] ) for : ( a ) @xmath180 , ( b ) @xmath181 , ( c ) @xmath182 , ( d ) @xmath183,,width=642 ]    [ figure3 ]",
    "the standard program of the replica method is formulated as follows : first , for an arbitrary positive integer @xmath0 we have to calculate the disorder average of the @xmath0-th power of the partition function , @xmath184 which is expected to be an analytic function of the replica parameter @xmath0 ; second , we have to perform an analytic continuation of this function from integer for arbitrary real or complex values of @xmath0 ; and third , we have to take the limit @xmath2 ( if we are interested in the average free energy only ) or we have to perform an integration over complex @xmath0 ( if we are deriving the free energy distribution function ) . this third step is usually accompanied by taking the thermodynamic limit , which assumes that the system size @xmath24 is taken to infinity .",
    "the prescription of the replica method indicates that the two limits , @xmath2 and @xmath41 , has to be taken simultaneously such that the product @xmath185 ( where an exponent @xmath26 defines the scaling of the free energy with the system size ) is kept finite .    in fact , the whole experience of the replica calculations in disordered systems shows that except for trivial cases this program , as it is formulated above , is never followed ! the typical illustration of the replicas _ realpolitik _",
    "is provided by the studies in the mean - field spin glasses @xcite .",
    "first of all , since the system is sufficiently complicated the computation of the replica partition function @xmath1 can be done here only in the saddle - point approximation and not exactly .",
    "this makes further analytic continuation to non - integer @xmath0 somewhat doubtful because the neglected terms which are small at _ integer _ @xmath0 and large system size could become essential in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , it turns out that at large @xmath0 the replica partition function growth as @xmath186 which means that its analytic continuation to non - integer @xmath0 is ambiguous . if nevertheless we would just plainly take the limit @xmath2 in the obtained expression for @xmath1 , we would get the so called replica symmetric ( rs ) solution which at low temperatures is unphysical since it reveals negative entropy and many other bad things",
    "in view of the remarks made above , of course , this is not surprising .",
    "the strategy , which is called the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) scheme @xcite , and which is generally believed to provide correct results , is essentially different . in this scheme , all the above three steps , ( computing @xmath1 , analytic continuation in @xmath0 and the limits @xmath2 and @xmath41 ) are performed simultaneously ! similar (",
    "although slightly simplified ) scheme works perfectly well also in the case of the random energy model of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "for both models the replica results are confirmed by independent mathematically rigorous calculations @xcite .",
    "there are many other systems for which the results of the replica calcualtions , although can not be confirmed rigorously , are generally accepted to be correct @xcite .    to understand what is going on",
    "sometimes it is useful to consider an example of very simple system .",
    "replica calculations for the model studied in this paper does not involve any kind of the rsb `` magic '' .",
    "the model is so simple that initially one gets an illusion that every step of the calculations could be under good control .",
    "for instance , unlike the above example , the replica partition function here can be computed exactly for any ( finite ) system size , eq.([2gdp27 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , proceeding with further steps of the replica method program one finds that either the attempt should be aborted , or one has to start cheating again .",
    "indeed , the result , eq.([2gdp27 ] ) , for the replica partition function turns out to be valid only for _ finite _ number of the integer points : @xmath187 $ ] , eq.([2gdp24 ] ) , since at @xmath188 the quantity @xmath1 is not defined ( it is formally divergent ) .",
    "moreover , for sufficiently large system size , @xmath189 , the replica partition function @xmath1 is not defined for _ all _ positive integer @xmath0 ( including @xmath190 ) . in other words , in this situation the replica partition function of the considered system , defined as @xmath103 ( where @xmath0 is a positive integer ) simply does not exist ! but even if @xmath191 , so that @xmath1 is still defined at finite number of the integer points , it is evident that its analytic continuation for non - integer values of @xmath0 is completely ambiguous . if nevertheless , one neglects all the above observations and accept the result , eq.([2gdp27 ] ) , as valid for all _ real _ @xmath0 in the interval @xmath107 , then everything becomes just fine .",
    "the analytic continuation of the function , eq.([2gdp27 ] ) , from the finite interval @xmath107 to the the complex half - plain , re@xmath192 is unambiguous , and in this way one obtains beautiful and _ correct _ results for the free energy distribution function ( figures 1 and 2 ) . in this particular case",
    "one can be sure that obtained results are indeed correct as for the system under consideration the quantity @xmath103 can be computed directly for any _ real _",
    "@xmath193 $ ] @xcite .",
    "all the experience of last decades convincingly demonstrate that with a few exceptions the replica method does give correct results , and this can not be explained by simple coincidences .",
    "we know very well _ how _ it works , and we do know that the replica calculations inevitably involves cheating .",
    "the question is then , _",
