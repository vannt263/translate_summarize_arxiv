    "the issue of scalar mesons has been the subject of vivid debate among the physical community for a long time because their identification and explanation in terms of quarks and gluons is difficult , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and refs . therein .",
    "especially some of those particles possess large decay widths , several decay channels and a huge background @xcite . during the past decades",
    "a large number of theoretical approaches were invented to handle these problems and to extract particle information from experimental data , in particular with the aim of understanding the lightest scalar state , the resonance @xmath0 .",
    "note , this resonance was identified with the scalar @xmath1-field of first @xmath1-models introduced by gell - mann and lvy @xcite , in which they referred to a field corresponding to a spinless meson that was introduced by schwinger @xcite . nowadays",
    ", modern versions of the @xmath1-model @xcite identify the @xmath1-field ( that is , the chiral partner of the pion ) with the scalar resonance @xmath2 .",
    "conversely , the state @xmath0 is now often interpreted as a molecular state or a so - called tetraquark state @xcite , a hypothetical mesonic structure first suggested by jaffe @xcite .",
    "new theoretical efforts were made by trnqvist and roos @xcite by locating the pole position of @xmath0 when fitting the whole light scalar nonet to scattering data .",
    "it is also possible to determine the @xmath1-pole by using roy equations with crossing symmetry , analyticity and unitarity  many works going in this direction were published in the last years and each has found comparable results .",
    "for instance , caprini _ et al . _ have stated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath3-scattering amplitude contains a pole with the quantum numbers of @xmath0 and calculated its mass and decay width within small uncertainties : @xmath4 mev .",
    "dispersive analysis of garca - martn _ et al .",
    "@xcite shows a similar result : @xmath5 mev .",
    "both specifications should make clear that the @xmath0 state is a very broad resonance with a decay width @xmath6 , hence it can not be parameterized by ordinary methods , for example by using a simple breit  wigner distribution function .    in this paper , which is based on the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , we concentrate on a simple quantum field theoretical toy model : a scalar state can decay into two ( pseudo-)scalar ones ( alias the pions ) . all but one of the free parameters inside the model are fixed by applying the resonance pole from either of the two references mentioned above as the propagator pole on the second riemann sheet . since the position of the pole is influenced by hadronic loop contributions of the two ( pseudo-)scalar particles , a function of the cutoff scale @xmath7 , we vary this parameter and obtain the spectral functions .",
    "our model consists of two scalar fields , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , described by a lagrangian of the form @xmath10 the same model was already studied by veltman @xcite as well as by giacosa and pagliara @xcite regarding its spectral function : it contains an interaction term for a one - channel decay process @xmath11 . in the one - loop approximation",
    ", the hadronic loop contributions from the @xmath9-fields appear in the inverse expression of the full interacting propagator of the scalar field @xmath8 after dyson resummation , @xmath12 where the emerging self - energy function @xmath13 represents the two @xmath9-particles inside a mesonic loop ( incoming and outgoing momentum is denoted by @xmath14 ) : @xmath15 the regularization function @xmath16 , which depends on a uv cutoff scale @xmath7 , was introduced to make the otherwise logarithmic divergent integral finite ( it can be included at the lagrangian level by rendering it nonlocal , e.g. ref .",
    "since we deal with an effective lagrangian in the low - energy regime to study light mesons , the mass scale of our model is determined : it is reasonable to set @xmath7 between 1 and 2 gev .",
    "the integral ( [ equation_hadronicloop ] ) is then evaluated by assuming the regularization function to depend only on the magnitude of the three - momentum ; we adopt the choice @xmath17 , yielding an exponentially decreasing interaction strength between the two @xmath9-particles for increasing distance .    according to the klln ",
    "lehmann spectral representation , the spectral function @xmath18 is known to be the negative imaginary part of the propagator taken slightly above the real axis of the complex @xmath19-plane . in our case",
    "it is more practical to consider the propagator in the complex @xmath20-plane , where @xmath21 is a running mass variable : @xmath22    we now continue the propagator into the second riemann sheet by exploiting the idea of a riemann surface and insert each one of the above poles to determine the coupling constant @xmath23 and the bare mass parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the mass of the free seed state as obtained from the lagrangian ( [ equation_lagrangian ] ) in the case of @xmath25 .",
    "when the coupling constant is large , the mass and width of the resonance can be successfully determined by the position of the complex pole of the full interacting propagator @xcite .",
    "indeed , large values of the coupling constant to intermediate hadronic states is one of the reasons why the scalar sector is not easily described by the naive quark model @xcite .",
    "the spectral function is determined for the poles of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , and for two different values of the cutoff parameter : @xmath26 gev and @xmath27 gev .",
    "the mass of the @xmath9-fields ( alias the pions ) is set to @xmath28 mev .",
    "we list the outcome of the numerical analysis in table [ table_parameters ] .    for a fixed cutoff",
    "we obtain very similar values for @xmath24 and @xmath23 for both poles : this is expected , since the two poles differ only marginally .",
    "when comparing the values between two different cutoffs , we note that , while the coupling constant hardly changes , the bare mass increases sizably for a larger cutoff . from a phenomenological point of view",
    "it is natural to think of @xmath24 as being highly influenced by the strong coupling to intermediate hadronic states and the creation of a mesonic cloud , respectively .",
    "such kind of mechanism usually causes the physical mass ( as the real part of the propagator pole ) to be smaller than @xmath24 , especially when increasing the coupling .",
    "a greater value for the cutoff enhances this influence .",
    "[ c]lcccc & & + used pole & @xmath24 [ gev ] & @xmath23 [ gev ] & @xmath24 [ gev ] & @xmath23 [ gev ] + caprini _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite & 0.468 & 2.013 & 0.561 & 2.034 + garca - martn _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite & 0.478 & 2.086 & 0.576 & 2.103 + & & & &    we show in fig . [ figure_spectral ] the spectral function above threshold , denoted as @xmath29 , for the resonance pole of garca - martn _ et al . _ and the parameters obtained above ( the higher cutoff corresponds to the dashed curve ) . in both cases the typical breit ",
    "wigner shape for an ordinary resonance is clearly absent : the peak is strongly shifted to the left and the whole structure is asymmetric .",
    "besides that , the spectral function is not normalized to one because a simple pole emerges on the first riemann sheet below threshold , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for further details about this pole and its possible , albeit speculative , physical meaning .",
    "increasing the cutoff reduces the lack of normalization . in summary ,",
    "a detailed study of the cutoff dependence in our model is desirable and a possible outlook for future work .      in conclusion",
    ", we have studied the spectral function of the lightest scalar meson @xmath0 within a simple quantum field theoretical model . in the future",
    ", one should also include the constrains of chiral symmetry and the rich hadron phenomenology by using the model developed in refs .",
