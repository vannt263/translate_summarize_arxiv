    "<S> in this talk we present the latest results from our ongoing project on geometro - thermodynamics ( also known as information geometry of thermodynamics or ruppeiner geometry ) of dilaton bhs in 4d in both einstein and string frames and a dyonic dilaton bh and at the end we report very briefly results from this approach to the 2d dilaton bhs .    </S>",

    "<S> the thermodynamic geometry , also known as ruppeiner geometry ( ruppeiner @xcite ) , of various bh families has been studied over the past few years ( see , man @xcite-@xcite , arcioni @xcite , sarkar @xcite , shen @xcite , mirza @xcite , ruppeiner @xcite and quevedo @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results so far have been physically suggestive , particularly in the myers - perry kerr bh case where the curvature singularities signal thermodynamic instability of the bh . </S>",
    "<S> the geometrical patterns are given by the curvature of the ruppeiner metric where @xmath0 is thermodynamic temperature of the system of interest . ] </S>",
    "<S> defined as the hessian of the entropy on the phase space of the thermodynamic system @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes mass ( internal energy ) and @xmath3 are other parameters such as charge and spin . </S>",
    "<S> the minus sign arises because entropy is a concave function . </S>",
    "<S> interpretations of the geometries associated with the metric are discussed in ruppeiner @xcite and references therein . even though most interesting ruppeiner metrics that we encounter have curvature singularities which might be interpretable , there are some known flat ruppeiner metrics that shed light on the understanding of thermodynamic geometries as a whole the structure of the entropy function ( or mass ) that gives a flat ruppeiner geometry . in man </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we proved a flatness theorem which states that riemann curvature tensor constructed out of the negative of the hessian of the entropy of the form @xmath4 will vanish , where @xmath5 is an arbitrary analytic function and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter condition is necessary in order for the metric to be nondegenerate . </S>",
    "<S> this theorem has proven useful in our work on the dilaton bhs as it allows us to see the local geometry already by glancing at the entropy function .    </S>",
    "<S> in this short article we will focus on the ongoing work on the application of the geometrical approach to the thermodynamics of the dilaton bhs . </S>",
    "<S> the 4d dilaton bh action can be obtained from the low energy limit of the string theory for the dilaton gravity reduced from string theory but for our work we use arbitrary @xmath7 which determines the gravitational coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> ] by dropping certain terms except for the metric @xmath8 , a dilaton @xmath9 and a maxwell field @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the action thus obtained is @xmath11 by making a conformal transformation @xmath12 we obtain the dilaton gravity action in einstein frame @xmath13 in the absence of the maxwell field the action reduces to the standard einstein theory with a massless scalar field as the matter . </S>",
    "<S> the bh solution of the two actions is given by the standard spherically symmetric metric @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the usual 2-sphere metric and @xmath16 the function @xmath17 is different for both frames , @xmath18 the horizon is located at @xmath19 with the singularity of the solution at @xmath20 for @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy for both bhs are given by @xmath22 the dyonic dilaton bh is slightly more complicated in that there is another @xmath23 gauge in contrast to the electric charge @xmath24 . ] </S>",
    "<S> field coupled to the action which takes the form @xmath25 we only consider such bhs in einstein frame . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy of the dyonic dilaton bh will have two charges hence not compatible with the flatness theorem . </S>",
    "<S> +     is a wedge on the null cone . for the dilaton bh in string frame </S>",
    "<S> the wedge fills the null cone for @xmath26 and 1._,width=340 ]    the ruppeiner metric for the 4d dilaton bh in both frames is flat for any values of @xmath7 as can be seen using our flatness theorem . in order to illustrate the state space of the flat ruppeiner metric for both bhs we employ eq . ( 11 ) which is a diagonal metric derived from the entropy in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ the - entropy ] ) given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath30 and its derivatives are basically the parentheses in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ the - entropy ] ) and for an arbitrary @xmath7 it is very complicated . </S>",
    "<S> however a power - series expansion of @xmath31 allows us to determine its range thereby giving us information on the opening of the wedge when we transform the metric ( [ diagonal ] ) into a flat minskowski via rindler coordinates ( @xmath32 ) . in our previous works , </S>",
    "<S> the wedge fills in the null cone for the myers - kerr bh when @xmath33 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dilaton bh in the einstein frame the wedge fills the null cone for any value of @xmath21 whereas the wedge in string frame fills the null cone of any value of @xmath21 and 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the ruppeiner metric and its conformal metric for the dyonic dilaton bh is nonflat with curvature singularity in the extremal limit . </S>",
    "<S> this was done using the classi program ( man @xcite ) . in the limit of @xmath34 </S>",
    "<S> the geometry becomes flat as expected .    </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the ruppeiner geometry of the 2d dilaton bh solutions which contain the reissner - nordstrm - like bh solution and btz ( for a comprehensive review , see grumiller @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> results up to date are enlightening and consistent with results in higher dimensions and our flatness theorem , as summarized in man @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however they await further interpretations .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude this article by noting that the geometro - thermodynamics of bhs provides an alternative route to obtain insight into thermodynamics through riemannian geometry . </S>",
    "<S> certain features of the geometry yield results that are consistent with those in the literature whereas some other features can potentially give rise to a deeper understanding of bh thermodynamics and perhaps the underlying statistical mechanics of bhs . despite the fact that only few results so far are physically suggestive , the geometrical patterns we have observed may play an important role in the future , when quantum gravity is better understood . </S>"
