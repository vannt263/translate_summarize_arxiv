    "this equation is formally equivalent to the benjamin - ono equation @xmath8 which was first introduced by benjamin @xcite and later by ono @xcite as a model equation for the same situation as the rbo .",

    "+ the rbo equation possesses three conservation laws : @xmath18 and @xmath19 this suggests that the space @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) is a good candidate for a global well - posedness theory of the cauchy problem associated to ( [ ecuabasica ] ) .",

    "<S> this paper has various goals : first , we develop a local and global well - posedness theory for the regularized benjamin - ono equation in the periodic setting , second , we show that the cauchy problem for this equation ( in both periodic and non - periodic case ) can not be solved by an iteration scheme based on the duhamel formula for negative sobolev indices , third , a proof of the existence of a smooth curve of periodic travelling wave solutions , for the regularized benjamin - ono equation , with fixed minimal period @xmath0 , is given . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that these solutions are nonlinearly stable in the energy space @xmath1 by perturbations of the same wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> finally , an extension of the theory developed for the regularized benjamin - ono equation is given and as an example it is proved that the cnoidal wave solutions associated to the benjamin - bona - mahony equation are nonlinearly stable in @xmath2 . </S>"
