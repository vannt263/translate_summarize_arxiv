    "stone - wales ( sw ) defects  @xcite are important topological defects in @xmath2-bonded carbon materials , and play crucial role in growth , isomerization , and nanoscale plasticity of carbon nanotube , fullerene , and graphitic nanostructures .",
    "@xcite sw transformation involves an in - plane 90@xmath3 bond rotation with respect to the bond center .",
    "this leads to pentagon - heptagon defects ( 5 - 7 - 7 - 5 dislocation dipole ) in carbon nanotube and graphene ,  @xcite and interchange of a pair of pentagonal and hexagonal rings in the fullerene .",
    "@xcite such structural transformations are believed to be the fundamental processes for the coalescence of fullerene  @xcite and nanotube ,  @xcite the formation of molecular junctions for nanoelectronic devices ,  @xcite and plastic deformation .  @xcite both chemically modified and unmodified sw defects induce local curvature to otherwise planer graphitic materials ,  @xcite which may enhance the formation of nanotube and fullerene from planer carbon nanostructures .",
    "@xcite coalescence of fullerene and nanotube has been also proposed to occur through a sequence of such structural transformation .",
    "@xcite sw defects alter the electronic properties of carbon nanostructures , and thus substantially modify chemical reactivity toward adsorbates ( reactivity increases compared to pristine counterpart ) ,  @xcite and transport properties.@xcite similar sw defects are also observed in boron nitride nanotube and nanosheet ,  @xcite and found to have important implications in determining physical and chemical properties .",
    "@xcite    it is known that 94% of the fullerene c@xmath4 isomers can be derived by a sequence of sw transitions .",
    "@xcite thus , sw transformation is believed to be the mechanism for fullerene isomerization or @xmath5-c@xmath4 formation , which represents the global minimum on the potential energy surface , during high temperature annealing .",
    "@xcite interchange of a pair of pentagonal and hexagonal rings in @xmath5-c@xmath4 through single sw transition leads to @xmath6 symmetry , which does not obey the isolated - pentagon rule .",
    "@xcite this is the first isomer and separated by @xmath0 1.6 ev energy from the global @xmath5-minimum .",
    "@xcite therefore , @xmath6-c@xmath4 represents the first step toward fullerene isomerization , or the last step of annealing process before reaching the icosahedral global minimum .",
    "@xcite although the pristine @xmath6 isomer is not experimentally observed earlier , the chlorinated @xmath6 isomer has recently been stabilized experimentally via krtschmer - huffman synthesis ,  @xcite and in the gas phase by subsequent dechlorination .",
    "@xcite the sw transition in fullerene is , however , thermodynamically limited due to very large activation barrier ( @xmath0 7 ev , fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "@xcite the barrier height is found to get reduced in the presence of an extra carbon or hydrogen atom .",
    "@xcite the extra carbon atom acts as autocatalyst and reduces activation energy by @xmath0 2 ev , when placed preferentially in the regions of paired pentagons .",
    "in contrast , the endohedral metal doping ( k , ca , and la ) has found to be relatively less effective in barrier height reduction .",
    "@xcite    ( color online ) activation energy barrier @xmath7 for @xmath5-c@xmath4 @xmath8 @xmath6-c@xmath4 transition , which represents single sw transition , is very high .",
    "activation barrier for the reverse transition ( @xmath6-c@xmath4 @xmath8 @xmath5-c@xmath4 ) is smaller by @xmath0 1.6 ev , which is the energy difference between c@xmath4 in @xmath5- and @xmath6-symmetry .",
    "the pyracyclene region is highlighted ( red).,width=302 ]    here we report the effect of substitutional doping on sw transition in c@xmath4 through first - principles density functional calculations .",
    "we find that the activation barrier is reduced substantially by substitutional boron doping at the active sw sites .",
    "the magnitude of reduction ( 2.12 ev and 4.34 ev for single and double b - doping , respectively ) is much larger compared to the cases with extra carbon or hydrogen or endohedral metal doping .",
    "@xcite boron doped heterofullerenes ( c@xmath9b@xmath10 , @xmath11 ) have been successfully synthesized ,  @xcite and are believed to be a promising candidate for hydrogen storage .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that h@xmath1 adsorption energy increases substantially for b - heterofellerenes , where the b - centers act as adsorption centers .",
    "our study shows that formation of sw defects are promoted in such b - doped heterofullerenes , which may alter the reversible storage properties as sw defects are known to be more reactive towards adsorbates .",
    "presence of such substitutional dopants is also expected to reduce the activation barrier and promote sw transition in other carbon nanostructures , and thus catalyze isomerization , fusion , and nanowelding processes .",
    "calculations were carried out using density functional theory implemented in the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) code  @xcite with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof exchange - correlation functional  @xcite and projector augmented wave pseudopotential  @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy cutoff was chosen to be 800 ev .",
    "symmetry unrestricted geometry optimizations were terminated when the force on each atom was less than 0.005 ev /  , and the reciprocal space integrations were carried out at the @xmath12 point .",
    "we determined the minimum - energy path for sw transition and the corresponding migration energy barrier @xmath7 using climbing - image nudged elastic band ( neb ) method .",
    "@xcite in neb , a set of intermediate states ( images ) are distributed along the reaction path connecting optimized initial ( @xmath5-c@xmath4 ) and final ( @xmath6-c@xmath4 ) states . to ensure the continuity of the reaction path ,",
    "the images are coupled with elastic forces and each intermediate state is fully relaxed in the hyperspace perpendicular to the reaction coordinate .",
    "determination of the activation energy necessary for sw transition ( @xmath5-c@xmath4 @xmath13 @xmath6-c@xmath4 ) via climbing - image neb method requires structural information of the initial and final structures , within the concerned level of theory .",
    "therefore , before we discuss the effect of b - doping on the activation energy , we begin our discussion with the structure and electronic properties of c@xmath4 , c@xmath14b , and c@xmath15b@xmath1 cages .",

    "@xcite , width=302 ]          there are two types of bonds in @xmath16-c@xmath4 : [ 6,6]-bonds ( 1.399 a ) at the junctions of two hexagons are smaller than [ 5,6]-bonds ( 1.453 a ) at the junctions of a pentagon and a hexagon .",
    "the optimized geometries in both @xmath16 and @xmath6 symmetries are shown in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] , and 14-atom pyracyclene region containing the rotating c@xmath1 dimer is shown in fig .",
    "[ pyra - bond ] . calculated [ 5,6 ] and [ 6,6 ]",
    "bond lengths ( fig .",
    "[ pyra - bond ] ) are in excellent agreement with previous theoretical calculations  @xcite and experimental measurements  @xcite for the @xmath5 structure .",
    "the rotating bond in @xmath6-c@xmath4 is much smaller , 1.359 a , which is also in agreement with previous theoretical calculations .",
    "@xcite however , no experimental information is available on pristine @xmath6-c@xmath4 , chlorinated @xmath6 structure ( c@xmath4cl@xmath17 ) shows a similar bond shortening of the rotating dimer ( 1.37 a ) .",
    "@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ pyra - bond ] , such bond shortening introduces local strain , and thus a distribution of bond lengths is observed in the pyracyclene region .",
    "when one of the c atoms in the rotating dimer ( see supplementary document  @xcite ) is replaced by b , three bond lengths involving c and b are increased ( two [ 5,6]-c@xmath18b=1.549 a , and [ 6,6]-c@xmath18b=1.524 a ) for @xmath5-c@xmath14b .",
    "this is responsible for the bond deformation in pyracyclene region ( the [ 5,6]-c@xmath18c bond distribution ranges from 1.442 a to 1.482 a ) . the trend of the structural changes in moving from @xmath5-c@xmath14b to @xmath6-c@xmath14b , remains same as is observed for pristine c@xmath4 .",
    "although , the structural properties of c@xmath15b@xmath19 show similar qualitative behavior , the pyracyclene region is comparatively more deformed due to the presence of long b@xmath18b ( 1.663 a ) bond , and four longer c@xmath18b ( 1.551 a ) bonds .",
    "though , strictly speaking , both the icosahedral and @xmath6 symmetries are broken due to b - doping , for simplicity we shall retain the same nomenclature in the following .",
    ".[table - energy ] energy difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 symmetries , @xmath20 ; and the energy gap @xmath21 between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) for both @xmath5- and @xmath6-symmetry .",
    "all the energies are in ev . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath6 structure is the first isomer , and in agreement with previous theoretical reports ,  @xcite we find that this structure is 1.57 ev higher in energy compared to the global @xmath5-minimum . calculated energy gap between the highest occupied molecular level ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular level ( lumo ) is 1.63 ev for @xmath5-symmetry , which agrees well with the spectroscopic measurements .",
    "@xcite due to the icosahedral symmetry , the homo ( @xmath22 ) and lumo ( @xmath23 ) are five and three fold degenerate , respectively , in @xmath5-c@xmath4 .",
    "these degeneracies are lifted ( fig .  [ levels ] ) due to the presence of topological defect introduced by sw transition or due to the substitutional b - doping .",
    "substitutional b introduces a local bond deformation in the structure , and also introduces holes into the system .",
    "both causes reduction of the homo - lumo gap , which are shown in table  [ table - energy ] . for pristine @xmath6-c@xmath4 ,",
    "the degeneracy of both homo and lumo is completely broken ( fig .",
    "[ levels ] ) , which in turn reduces @xmath21 by @xmath0 0.7 ev .    single substitutional b introduces a significant bond deformation ,  @xcite and thus the inherent symmetry of c@xmath14b deviates from perfect @xmath5-symmetry , which removes the five - fold degeneracy of the homo level ( fig .  [ levels ] ) .",
    "substitutional b introduces hole ( one / b - atom ) into the system , and thus the homo in @xmath5-c@xmath14b is singly occupied , which is pushed 0.47 ev above compared to the pristine @xmath5-c@xmath4 , which reduces the gap .",
    "in addition , when a sw topological defect is introduced the three - fold degeneracy of lumo is completely lifted ( fig .",
    "[ levels ] ) , and pulled down by @xmath0 0.2 ev .",
    "this reduces the gap even more for the @xmath6-c@xmath14b structure .",
    "similarly , when two c atoms are replaced ( the system has two holes ) the degeneracy in homo is broken .",
    "one of these levels is completely unoccupied and serves as lumo in @xmath5-c@xmath15b@xmath1 .",
    "this level lies 0.98 ev above the occupied homo .",
    "the orbital degeneracy of the homo is further broken and pushed above to further reduce the gap in @xmath6-c@xmath15b@xmath1 structure .",
    "activation barriers for the sw transition in carbon nanotube , graphitic nanostructure , and fullerene are generally very high .",
    "@xcite our calculated energy barrier for the pristine c@xmath4 is found to be 6.88 ev ( fig .  [ neb ] ) , which is in agreement with previous reports obtained within a range of theories .",
    "@xcite compared to carbon nanotube or graphitic nanostructures , the activation barrier in fullerene is considerably less due to the strain present in fullerene structure .",
    "@xcite we find that the rotating c@xmath1 unit in the transition state ( ts ) pops - out ( by @xmath0 0.21 a ) from the c@xmath4 surface .",
    "similar ts was predicted previously .",
    "@xcite the bond length of the rotating c@xmath1 unit shrinks to 1.248 a in the ts from the corresponding bond length in @xmath5 ( 1.399 a ) and @xmath6 ( 1.359",
    "a ) symmetries .",
    "therefore , this c@xmath1 bond can be characterized as a stretched @xmath24-bond .",
    "@xcite    we find that the large sw activation barrier is reduced substantially by b - doping ( fig .",
    "[ neb ] ) at the active sw site .",
    "the barrier is reduced by 2.12 ev , when a single c - atom is replaced in the rotating dimer by b for the c@xmath14b heterofullerene .",
    "the reduction is comparable in magnitude with the cases where an extra carbon was strategically placed in the regions of paired pentagons  @xcite or catalyzed by hydrogen .",
    "@xcite in contrast , the endohedral metal doping has relatively smaller effect .",
    "the barrier was found to reduce by only 0.80 ev for la - doping .",
    "@xcite in the present case , the barrier is further reduced to 2.54 ev , when both the c - atoms in the rotating dimer are replaced with b - atoms for c@xmath15b@xmath1 heterofullerene .",
    "compared to pristine c@xmath4 , a total reduction of 4.34 ev is obtained which is the maximum reported till date .",
    "we find that for pristine c@xmath4 as well as b doped c@xmath4 , the structure corresponding to the saddle point has only one vibrational mode with imaginary frequency .",
    "this confirms that the obtained saddle points are indeed true first - order transition states .",
    "we find that the frequency of this imaginary mode decreases with the introduction of single b , which further decreases with the introduction of second b ( 962 @xmath25 , 377 @xmath25 , and 167 @xmath25 for c@xmath4 , c@xmath14b , and c@xmath15b@xmath1 , respectively ) .",
    "thus the variation of energy along the reaction path becomes slower , i.e , the neb curve gets flatter , with the introduction of boron ( fig .",
    "[ neb ] ) .",
    "( color online ) the activation energy barrier to the sw transition ( @xmath26 ) reduces substantially for the b - heterofullerenes , when b is doped in the active sw site ( rotating dimer ) .",
    "the reverse barrier is smaller by an amount @xmath27 , reported in table  [ table - energy ] , which are similar in magnitude for all compositions .",
    ", width=321 ]    origin of the reduction in sw activation barrier can be explained in terms of changes in bond strength , charge density and phonon spectra , which point toward bond weakening at and around the rotating dimer .",
    "first , we calculate c@xmath18c , c@xmath18b , and b@xmath18b bond strengths in pristine c@xmath4 , c@xmath14b , and c@xmath15b@xmath1 , respectively , which can be approximately calculated through following expressions , @xmath28 / 3 \\nonumber \\\\ e_{\\rm b - b } & = & \\left [ e^{\\rm tot}_{{\\rm c}_{58}{\\rm",
    "b}_2 } - 85 \\times   e_{\\rm \\tiny c - c } - 4 \\times   e_{\\rm c - b } \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 represents the total binding energy of the respective structures . calculated bond strength decreases with b - doping : 5.87 , 4.74 and 3.75 ev , respectively , for @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this hints toward the presence of weaker c@xmath18b bonds around the rotating dimer , causing the sw bond rotation to be easier for the b - doped heterofullerenes .",
    "this qualitatively explains the reduction in activation barrier .",
    "we further note that the amount of reduction is related to the reduction in bond strength as @xmath33 $ ] , where @xmath34 is the number of c@xmath18b bonds present in c@xmath14b ( two ) , and c@xmath15b@xmath1 ( four ) heterofullerenes .",
    "( color online ) due to the b - doping phonons shift toward lower frequencies , which indicate bond weakening .",
    "phonons for the 14-atom pyracyclene around the rotating dimer is shown for @xmath5-symmetry .",
    "arrows are guide to eye.,width=321 ]        next we turn our attention to the phonon frequencies calculated at the @xmath12 point .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the atoms around the rotating bond are mostly affected due to b - doping and sw rotation .",
    "thus , we considered the 14-atom pyracyclene ring around the rotating bond to calculate the normal vibrational modes .",
    "this significantly reduces the size of hessian matrix ( from 180 @xmath35 180 for the full cluster to 42@xmath3542 ) to calculate phonon frequencies .",
    "[ phonon ] shows that due to b - doping , phonon frequencies shift gradually to the lower frequencies , indicating the bonds get softer as the phonon frequency ( @xmath36 ) is related to bond stiffness ( @xmath37 ) as , @xmath38 .",
    "the observed softening in phonon frequencies arises due to two factors .",
    "firstly , the c@xmath18b and b@xmath18b bonds are longer and also less stronger compared to the c@xmath18c bonds , as pointed out earlier . additionally , the c@xmath18c bonds around the rotating unit also get elongated due to the substantial strain introduced by b - doping , and thus get weakened . the rotation of bond is easier in such softer environment , which eventually reduces the sw activation barrier .",
    "bonding charge density analysis ( fig .  [ cdensity ] ) also qualitatively points towards softening of the bonds that are involved in sw process .",
    "figure  [ cdensity ] shows the plots of bonding charge densities for pristine c@xmath4 , singly and doubly b - doped c@xmath4 . for pristine c@xmath4 ,",
    "the c@xmath18c bonding is completely covalent i.e. , the bonding charge accumulation is at the centers of the bond .",
    "this picture deviates for b - doped cases , where the charge accumulation centers move toward the c - atom for c@xmath18b bonds , imparting ionic character to the c@xmath18b bonds .",
    "thus , the c@xmath18c rotation is increasingly easier for c@xmath14b and c@xmath15b@xmath1 heterofullerenes .",
    "the bonding character can be also quantitatively understood from bader charge analysis ,  @xcite which reveals that each b - atom looses @xmath39 charge to the neighboring c - atoms .",
    "this indicate deviation from perfect covalent character .",
    "( color online ) the @xmath26 transition ( reaction ) rate , and thus the characteristic time scale for the corresponding transition has arrhenius dependence on temperature and activation energy .",
    "subsequent b - doping in the rotating dimer reduces the characteristic time - scale enormously via decrease in the activation barrier.,width=302 ]    at temperatures well below the melting point , the harmonic approximation to transition state theory ( htst ) can be applied to study the reaction rate or characteristic time - scale associated with the reaction .",
    "the reaction rate can be expressed in terms of energy and normal mode frequencies at the saddle point and initial state ,  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath7 = ( @xmath41 ) is the activation energy with @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) being the energy corresponding to initial ( transition ) state , and the @xmath44 are the corresponding normal mode frequencies . within the harmonic approximation , the the entropic effect to the reaction rate ,",
    "is included in the prefactor involving phonon frequencies calculated at zero temperature .",
    "the first - order transition state is characterized by one imaginary phonon , which is excluded for the transition state . to calculate the prefactor we have only considered the normal modes corresponding to 14-atom pyracyclene ring around the rotating dimer .",
    "the characteristic time - scale associated with a given reaction can be calculated from the knowledge of reaction rate @xmath45 as @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ rate ] shows the characteristic time required for single @xmath26 sw transition plotted as a function of temperature .",
    "the characteristic time scale , measured in second , differs by @xmath47 between c@xmath4 , c@xmath4b and c@xmath4b@xmath1 in the temperature range 1000 - 2000 k. for example , at 1700 k , single sw bond rotation event takes place in @xmath0 10 days for pristine c@xmath4 . in contrast , at the same temperature , the process is enormously accelerated and requires only time scale of about second and micro - second for c@xmath14b and c@xmath15b@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "it should be pointed out that the reverse transition ( @xmath48 , which is not shown in fig",
    ".  [ rate ] ) is much faster than the forward transition ( @xmath26 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ rate ] ) .",
    "this is caused by the presence of exponential factor , @xmath49 , which is five orders of magnitude smaller for @xmath48 , compared to @xmath26 at temperature 1700 k.",
    "the stone - wales activation barrier in pristine fullerene is very large .",
    "earlier it has been found that this high barrier can get reduced by @xmath0 35% by the presence of an extra carbon or hydrogen .",
    "@xcite our present study shows that presence of substitutional boron at the active stone - wales site can become even more effective in reduction of the stone - wales activation barrier .",
    "it can get reduced substantially by @xmath0 30% and 60% , due to single and double b - doing , respectively . calculated charge density and phonon spectrum",
    "indicate that the c@xmath18b bonds are softer compared to the c@xmath18c bonds , and the presence of such weaker bonds around the rotating dimer is responsible for the observed reduction in activation barrier . from thermodynamic point of view ,",
    "such reduction in the activation barrier @xmath50 enormously reduces the time - scale associated with the stone - wales process .",
    "the reduction is of the order of @xmath51 @xmath52 fold at temperature 1700 k for single ( double ) b - doping .",
    "stone - wales defects are known to alter the chemical reactivity toward adsorbates ,  @xcite thus are expected to effect the proposed reversible h@xmath1 storage properties of b - heterofullerenes .",
    "@xcite though , here we have shown the reduction of stone - wales activation barrier for fullerene , similar reduction is expected for carbon nanotube and graphene nanostructures due to b - doping , which will catalyze fusion , and welding process necessary for nanoelectronic device applications .",
