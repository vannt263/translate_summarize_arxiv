    "not long before graphene was first manufactured by the manchester research group in 2004 @xcite , theorists still believed that such two - dimensional structures were unstable due to thermal fluctuations @xcite , famously referred to as the landau ",
    "peierls arguments ( cf . also mermin  wagner theorem @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the paradox behind graphene s existence has been resolved @xcite , and that it can be stabilised by transverse lattice distortions @xcite . stable forms of various other two - dimensional crystals such as graphene , silicene and germanene have all been attained @xcite .",
    "graphene was the first example which is able to exist in a single atomic layer with honeycomb hierarchy @xcite ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig1ab ] ) .",
    "it is composed of a single layer of carbon atoms , and can be extracted from graphite with full preservation of the hexagonal honeycomb structure ( also referred to as chicken wire for quantum information processing @xcite ) .",
    "this material has astonishing properties : it is stronger than diamond , more conductive than copper and more flexible than rubber . graphene has primarily attracted the attention of scientific and engineering communities , due to its outstanding electrical , thermal and optical properties @xcite , displaying having a strong potential for many applications .",
    "graphene has also exhibited anomalous quantum behaviour at room temperature , such as klein tunneling , relativistic quantum brownian motion @xcite and the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) @xcite .",
    "these phenomena have also drawn strong attention in the field of quantum engineering @xcite .",
    "the 2010 nobel prize @xcite is not the end of the story , it is merely the beginning of an adventure - how to make graphene applicable , being our main concern .",
    "graphene sensors , transistors , and a number of electronic nano - devices are emerging in laboratories every day @xcite . furthermore , graphene is an easily manufactured material - electrically compatible with many existing key materials , such as silicon .",
    "the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice - carbon atoms a and b per unit cell are shown .",
    "the form of graphene , or other two - dimensional crystals ( such as silicene , bn or germanene ) can be approximately flat , or slightly corrugated ( cf .",
    "side - view of figure [ fig1ab]b ) @xcite .",
    "this corrugation depends upon the physical conditions of graphene.,width=566 ]    graphene is the thinnest material in the world - a single layer of carbon atoms with a hexagonal structure @xcite ( cf",
    ". figure  [ honeycomb]a ) .",
    "it is one of the allotropes of carbon , diamond being another example , albeit with different physical properties .",
    "graphene layers stack together to form a graphite crystal lattice , and can be found in the form of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) or even the core of a pencil @xcite .",
    "there are four electrons present in the outer shell of a single carbon atom . for graphene",
    ", there are three @xmath0 bonds and one @xmath1 bond present .",
    "the @xmath0 bonds are an @xmath2 orbital hybridisation - a mixture of orbitals @xmath3 , thus providing a strong binding force for its atomic neighbours .",
    "the remaining electron @xmath4 orbital constitutes the @xmath1 bond . these are responsible for the half - filled band that enables free - moving electrons , thus displaying a metallic characteristic @xcite",
    "graphene is also capable of being combined with hydrogen or oxygen to form ` graphane ' , or other carbonic compounds respectively .    at low temperature , suspended graphene",
    "may also give rise to small quantum corrugations , whereby the two sub - lattices ( a and b ) are shifted with respect to each other in a transverse direction ( cf .",
    "figure  [ honeycomb]b ) .",
    "the distance is of the order equivalent to some fraction of the inter - atomic spacing . at room temperature ,",
    "the shape is nearly flat , with corrugation remaining only on the large scale @xcite . here ,",
    "low temperature microscopic quantum corrugations are transformed into transverse thermal vibrations .    in 1947",
    ", wallace @xcite first studied the electronic band structure of monolayer graphite ( graphene ) by applying the simplest tight - binding model with a single hopping integral .",
    "he showed that the conduction band is half - filled , with an electronic spectrum that is gapless at six points of the brillouin zone . in vicinity of these points , the energy - momentum spectrum has a conical , dirac form .",
    "these six points are therefore referred to as the dirac points .",
    "he concluded that within two - dimensional graphene , an electrical conductivity should theoretically exist .",
    "a year later , ruess and vogt @xcite observed thin - film graphene oxide ( go ) pieces using transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "a single layer of graphene oxide was then discovered by boehm _",
    "@xcite in the early 1960s , and it was boehm _",
    "et al . _ who first proposed the name ` graphene ' in their studies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , all these systems were found to be insulating .",
    "although research on graphene , graphene - like structures and epitaxial graphene films continued for decades ( cf . for example @xcite ) , it has significantly intensified since 2004 , when geim and his fellow researchers @xcite successfully segregated graphene flakes from graphite using the simple scotch - tape method @xcite .",
    "this process will be elaborated upon in section ii.a .",
    "they subsequently went on to show that a graphene layer , separated from graphite , is an example of a two - dimensional structure possessing outstanding electrical properties @xcite .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that a huge number of studies on the physical and chemical properties of graphene have emerged in recent decades .",
    "logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of electronic devices  the transistor being a key example . here",
    ", the diagram shows the basic ` not ' and ` and ' logic gates .",
    "the input / output signals are generally either one or zero .",
    "the inverting amplifier is also shown .",
    "the underlying principle is dependent upon the ratio of the resistors @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with an output voltage @xmath7 .",
    "this output voltage can be adjusted by the varying the resistors in the circuit.,width=302 ]    recently , there has been strong progress in development of many graphene applications .",
    "graphene s unique electrical properties make it an ideal material for many electronic devices  in particular , graphene based transistors . in the present article , we describe various designs of graphene transistor that have been recently proposed , and how they capitalise upon graphene s high electron mobility and conductivity .    the field - effect transistor ( fet ) was first reported by j. barden and w. h. brattain in the 1940s at bell laboratories @xcite .",
    "a transistor is the basic building block of many electronic circuits , normally acting as a logic gate or inverting amplifier in integrated circuits ( cf .",
    "figure  [ logic ] ) . according to moore s law ,",
    "the size of a circuit decreases roughly by half , every 1.5 years @xcite .",
    "however , the scaling techniques , as well as the speed of the devices , have both reached a bottleneck in recent years .",
    "this is mainly because the decreasing scale leads to an increase of the energy dissipation per unit area ( i.e. , power density ) .",
    "the operating speed is also limited by the mobility and thermal conductivity of existing materials .",
    "new materials are thus highly sought after , to alleviate such aforementioned drawbacks .",
    "this article gives a brief review of the most up - to - date properties of graphene , electronic devices and transistors , together with their operational mechanism .",
    "the type of graphene ( characterised by different properties ) depends strongly upon its method of preparation .",
    "three methods in particular , include mechanical exfoliation from bulk graphite @xcite , graphitisation of silicon carbide ( sic ) substrates ( epitaxial growth ) @xcite , and chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) on various transition metals @xcite . in terms of the quality of graphene ( such as mobility or structural defects ) , the exfoliated graphene produces the best material , followed by epitaxial graphene , and finally , cvd methods .     the simplest method of segregating graphene from graphite , via the ` scotch - tape ' method .",
    "by placing graphite flakes upon the tape , and then repeating the folding / unfolding process , we can thus obtain one or few layers of graphene .",
    "simple optical instrumentation ( via the principle of light interference ) can be used to verify the existence of graphene.,width=302 ]      mechanical cleavage is one of the simplest methods of fabricating a graphene layer @xcite .",
    "the process is similar to a folding and unfolding technique ( as shown in figure  [ mech ] ) .",
    "one has to first cut the surface of a graphite sample @xcite , usually with highly ordered pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) being used @xcite . a small piece of graphite is then placed upon the sticky surface of adhesive tape @xcite .",
    "the tape is folded and unfolded , with gradually more and more layers being stripped away @xcite .",
    "the graphite is therefore made thinner - the procedure being repeated until what remains is one , or few layers of graphene .",
    "monolayer graphene can be verified through a simple optical microscope via light interference patterns @xcite , or also via raman spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the mobility of exfoliated graphene can reach 15,000  @xmath8v@xmath9s@xmath9 @xcite . despite being a relatively simple way to produce graphene",
    ", this method produces only small quantities each time @xcite .",
    "an alternative means of fabricating graphene is via the epitaxial growth technique .",
    "graphene produced in this way would usually possess an intermediate range of values for the mobility , smaller than for exfoliated graphene , but larger than for cvd graphene .",
    "silicon carbide ( sic ) is coated on a silicon wafer , with high temperatures being required @xcite .",
    "both silicon and carbon atoms would then individually become segregated . as the silicon atoms are evaporated by temperatures in excess of @xmath10",
    ", only carbon atoms remain @xcite and graphene will subsequently grow on the substrate @xcite . regardless ,",
    "structural defects are always found since carbon atoms will sometimes be burnt due to the high temperatures - thus being contaminated by oxygen and hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the quality of epitaxial graphene can be conveniently analysed with the use of raman spectroscopy . in particular , studies of the raman",
    "active , single phonon ( g band ) and the two - phonon ( 2d band ) are popular @xcite .",
    "analysis of the position and shape of these raman scattering lines provide much useful information .",
    "for example , the observation of a high - frequency shift of the g peak may describe graphene doping and associated changes in electron mobility @xcite .",
    "it is also highly beneficial for the monitoring of dopants ( via raman scattering ) in an electrochemically top - gated graphene transistor .",
    "the local mapping of these raman modes on the graphene surface ( a method known as raman topography ) may describe the charge puddles created in graphene , as well as many other inhomogenous structures .",
    "in particular , recent studies of the raman topography of epitaxial graphene , show that the electron mobility is highly dependent upon thickness and monolayer strain uniformity @xcite . at room temperature , the highest mobility of epitaxial graphene ( on the carbon - terminated face of the sic substrate )",
    "reaches a value of 5,000  @xmath8v@xmath9s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the carrier mobility depends strongly upon the stacking of graphene layers @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for exfoliated graphene ( produced by mechanical cleavage method ( cf . section ii.a ) ) , the mobility is higher when compared to that via the epitaxial growth technique @xcite .     chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) is a high - temperature chemical process , subjecting catalytic metals to hydrocarbon gases .",
    "gases such as hydrogen ( @xmath11 ) and methane ( @xmath12 ) , are both added to the chamber .",
    "the high temperatures decompose the molecular bonds , until all hydrogen has been burnt out .",
    "what remains is a single layer of carbon atoms being deposited on the metal surface.,width=302 ]      chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) is usually used in industry @xcite , since it can be easily mass produced .",
    "the process involves high - temperature chemical reactions with hydrocarbon gases ( e.g. @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and a catalytic metal surface such as either copper or nickel ( cf .",
    "figure 4 ) .",
    "these metals help decompose the chemical bonding @xcite , and order carbon atoms into a hexagonal ( honeycomb ) lattice .",
    "hence , the larger the metal surface , the larger the quantity of graphene that can be produced . for this purpose ,",
    "the most popular is a polished polycrystalline copper foil .",
    "it is easy to transfer graphene from this metal surface to other substrates  for example , by applying a voltage .",
    "therefore , the cvd method exhibits large scale superiority with respect to other graphene production methods .",
    "it is a relatively simple and low - cost method which allows the growing of monolayer graphene to large size @xcite .",
    "however , the charge carrier mobility of cvd graphene is generally lower than data reported for exfoliated graphene @xcite .",
    "it was found that the main source of this low mobility is the presence of grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "this has been well studied with the use of both transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) and scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) .",
    "the point defects , as well as surface contamination , are further key factors which significantly affect the mobility .",
    "the mobility of a short channel device , where the grain boundary is absent , can reach 2,700  @xmath8v@xmath9s@xmath9 . in the presence of this boundary",
    ", it will be roughly three or four times smaller @xcite .",
    "mobility is a measure of how fast the carriers propagate in an electric field .",
    "its value depends upon the type of material and the interaction with substrates . after the process of annealing , some suggest the mobility of exfoliated graphene can reach values upwards of 200,000  @xmath8v@xmath9s@xmath9 @xcite in a perfect structure .",
    "recently , experiments with graphene @xcite show that at this specific point , there should be a minimum conductivity in graphene @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this is around double the value for the conductance quantum @xmath14 , observed in quantum wires @xcite .",
    "this value is independent of the material properties and length of the quantum wire @xcite .",
    "it is also of particular interest that the concentration of electrical carriers at the dirac point tends to zero . here , even at room temperature",
    ", the charge - carriers may perform long range ( ballistic ) transport without much scattering at all @xcite .",
    "graphene is also useful for electronics , especially due to its elasticity and strong resistance against destruction .",
    "young s modulus for graphene can be as large as 1tpa @xcite .",
    "graphene is the strongest material in the world , around 100 times stronger than steel @xcite . yet ,",
    "due to its monolayer structure ( cf . figure [ fig1ab ] ) , it can be stretched and bent rather easily .      using high - resolution vacuum scanning thermal microscopy ,",
    "it was found by pumarol _",
    "_ @xcite that thermal conductivity in suspended graphene is carried by ballistic phonons .",
    "hence , the thermal conductance of graphene on a substrate will significantly downgrade , since the number of scattering channels increases . in this case",
    ", heat may be lost to the substrate .",
    "the thermal conductance also decreases with an increased number of graphene layers .",
    "analysing nano - thermal images , it was found that the mean - free - path of thermal phonons in graphene on a substrate , is smaller than 100 nm . according to prasher @xcite",
    ", the thermal conductivity of graphene on a silicon - dioxide substrate can reach around 600  wm@xmath9k@xmath9 , incidentally higher than copper .",
    "other papers provide even higher values for the in - plane thermal conductivity , but of the same order of 1,000  wm@xmath9k@xmath9 @xcite . the heat flow between graphene and the substrate ,",
    "would influence the dissipation , due to the high in - plane thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "thus , in - plane heat transport for graphene is associated with acoustic phonons @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism of heat transport across graphene interfaces in the cross - plane direction is currently unknown , as mentioned by koh _",
    "@xcite      single layer graphene absorbs a mere @xmath15 of visible light ( where @xmath16 is the fine structure constant @xcite ) , thus possessing a high transparency @xcite .",
    "graphene provides a wide range of absorption across the visible light spectrum .",
    "@xcite mention that the peak of absorption is in the ultraviolet domain , because of the van hove singularity .",
    "the peak arises due to the van hove singularity in the energy density of states ( dos ) .",
    "it is , in fact , a well suited material for photonic devices .",
    "being almost perfectly transparent to visible light due to its atomic thickness , such a material can be made available for small screen devices @xcite . for similar reasons , there is also common belief that graphene s true potential lies in opto - electronics , as discussed by nair _",

    "stoehr _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite observed white optical luminescence of graphene , when subject to picosecond infrared laser pulses - this creates a high density electron - hole plasma .",
    "the luminescence arises due to electron - hole recombination , created in a broad energy range .",
    "there are two relaxation mechanisms observed in the graphene electron - hole plasma @xcite .",
    "the first relaxation mechanism relates to the intra - band electrons and holes collisions , with a duration of around hundred femtosecond .",
    "the second one arises from the cooling of hot optical phonons , with around a few picoseconds , which is slower than first mechanism @xcite .     in graphene ,",
    "the conduction and valence bands touch at six points of the brillouin zone .",
    "these are referred to as the dirac points . in the vicinity of these points , both the conduction ( red ) and valence ( blue ) bands have a conical shape . these cones can be used to describe the low - energy - momentum dispersion relationship , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fermi velocity and @xmath19 defines the electron momentum .",
    "the fermi energy level @xmath20 usually coincides with the dirac point - where the density of states ( dos ) is equal to zero .",
    "electrons occupy all states in the valence band , with the conduction band remaining unoccupied.,width=377 ]      graphene has a closely packed , periodic structure of carbon atoms , and consists of two carbon sub - lattices ( a and b ) per unit cell @xcite ( cf . figure  [ honeycomb]a ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , there are six dirac points in the corners of brillouin zone , with a linear , conical relationship being found in the lower part of the energy - momentum spectrum .",
    "this can be approximated by the following dispersion relation @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath18 is fermi velocity , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the electron momenta in the graphene plane .",
    "the points in momentum space where the energy vanishes ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) are called the dirac points . a single dirac cone for the graphene energy spectrum is shown in figure  [ cone ] .",

    "quantum behavior is normally exhibited at low temperature ; such processes include the qhe , where the transverse hall resistance is quantised .",

    "@xcite reveal that klein tunneling can occur in graphene , as depicted in figure [ klein ] .",
    "it is further surprising that a perfect transmission occurs in graphene @xcite .",
    "overall , it appears as if electrons penetrate the square potential wall , without restriction being placed upon on its height . in reality",

    "the band structure of cnts is determined by the boundary conditions ( bcs ) , specified by the folding angle and radius of the cnt ( sometimes known as the chiral index ) @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , determines whether the cnt is a conductor or a semiconductor .",
    "generally , the boundary of a cnt can be classified as having zigzag or armchair structure , or a mixture of both ( cf .",
    "figure  [ boundary ] for the gnr ) .",
    "zigzag cnts are conductors , whereas armchair cnts can either be a conductor or semiconductor ( dependent upon the radius @xmath68 of the nanotube ) @xcite . this radius is found to be inversely proportional to energy band - gap @xmath67 @xmath69 the wave function @xmath70 of the cnt is also subject to a periodic boundary condition , thus determining the degeneracy of energy states @xcite .",

    "the choice of material for the channel inside is usually composed of either cnts , gnrs or bilayer transistors @xcite .",
    "@xcite state that the current in tunneling transistors arises due to a leap of electrons between the conduction and valence bands , rather than via diffusive and thermal transport ( the concept is similar to landau - zener tunneling @xcite ) . in general , a tunneling transistor ( via some quantum process ) consumes much less power than a non - tunneling equivalent @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have also proposed that within the tunneling graphene transistor , the on / off switching ratio could reach as high as @xmath115 , and that tunneling could occur even with a small applied gate voltage .",
    "overall , the band - to - band tunneling in a graphene transistor is generally dependent upon the band - gap width , channel length , oxide thickness and gate voltage @xcite .",
    "zhao _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have studied a nanoribbon tunneling transistor , claiming that an ambipolar behavior can be altered to an asymmetric type via doping - highly suited to logic switches .",

    "another report by zhang _",
    "@xcite has also revealed that the nanoribbon tunneling transistor could also operate at high speed .",
    "the tunneling probability is a function of the energy band - gap @xmath116 , that is @xmath117,\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is a dimensionless constant , @xmath119 refers to the channel width , @xmath120 is an electric charge , while @xmath107 is the drain - source voltage @xcite .",
    "the width of the ribbon would also affect tunneling probability .",
    "_ @xcite further explain that a leakage current is present in the off state , most likely associated with some thermal emission .",
    "however , yang _",
    "@xcite , in their study , claim that the nanoribbon tunneling transistor consumes energy which is 8 - 9 orders of magnitude lower than a silicon - based counterpart .",
    "malec _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have investigated the vertical tunneling between graphene and adjacent metal layers .",
    "they found that the dos in graphene would consequently affect the conductivity of the devices @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have also studied graphene as a dielectric sandwich , positioned between two metal plates .",
    "quantum tunneling was found to act perpendicular between the two plates , and is dependent upon temperature @xcite . in 2012 , britnell _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a new type of transistor that stems from the idea of quantum tunneling between the insulating and graphene layers , thus effectively acting as a vertical transistor channel .",
    "the multilayer tunneling transistor @xcite constitutes a few insulating layers of hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) , positioned between the two graphene plane electrodes .",
    "thus , the hbn is a kind of dielectric barrier which can prevent current leakage , thus consuming less energy .     the multilayer graphene tunneling transistor , as proposed by britnell _ et al .",
    "its innovative design leads to electrons tunnelling vertically , rather than horizontally across the channel . both the gate and drain - source voltage",
    "are applied perpendicular to the layers , with charge carriers subsequently accumulating on graphene layers .",
    "electrons can then tunnel between these layers.,width=302 ]    the underlying mechanism @xcite is as follows ( cf .",
    "figure  [ tranvert ] for a diagrammatic representation ) .",
    "the fermi levels and potential barriers are controlled by an applied gate voltage @xmath71 .",
    "an electron tunnels between the two graphene layers , only when an electric field ( drain - source voltage ) is applied , and is sufficiently high to overcome the barrier . when the gate voltage is applied between the silicon gate and the bottom graphene layer ,",
    "charge carriers in the top and bottom graphene layers begin to accumulate .",
    "the fermi level is raised , and the dos increases at the same time .",
    "together with the potential difference between the two graphene layers , electrons will be more likely to tunnel form one graphene layer to another .",
    "not only does the applied gate voltage change the dos , but also modifies the potential barriers between the graphene and insulating layers @xcite .",
    "therefore , a tunneling current through hbn layers is induced , and can be tuned by the magnitude of @xmath71 .",
    "_ @xcite have also found that the transport carriers are holes .",
    "the report also reveals that a larger @xmath71 and separation of the layers would also enhance the switching ratio .",
    "the tunneling nature would also allow the transistor to operate at high frequency , as well as with a high current - gain ( cf . for details , georgiou",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one can create a band - gap in graphene via any of the aforementioned methods .",
    "even if the band - gap is open , generally , the switching ratio is very small .",
    "this is one of the major drawbacks of graphene logic transistors .",
    "however , this is no problem for an operational amplifier , or in high - frequency circuits @xcite .",
    "an amplifying transistor , in general , only requires an on state .",
    "this is because an amplifier requires only a current / voltage input for its operation - thus no off state is required .",
    "@xcite . the high mobility of carriers in graphene renders a fast response to the input signal , which can be up to a few hundred ghz , ( cf . for details @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , the cut - off frequency @xmath121 and the maximum oscillation frequency @xmath122 both determine the speed of a transistor @xcite .",
    "this maximum oscillation frequency refers to the unity power - gain @xcite . the cut - off frequency , however , is defined by a current - gain equal to one @xcite , and is proportional to the trans - conductance @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath124 where @xmath125 is the transistor gate length . to reach a high value for @xmath82",
    ", one has to maximise @xmath126 and minimise @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have studied the shortest gate length down to 40 nm with a cut - off frequency of 155  ghz .",
    "_ @xcite have also found , via simulation , that the maximum cut - off frequency can reach up to 300  ghz . on the other hand , impurities and defects",
    "would not only downgrade the value of @xmath82 , but the maximum oscillation frequency as well @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite also mention that the power - gain in the graphene transistor is particularly low because of the unstable saturation region , of which at present , not much is understood .",
    "they add that the maximum oscillation frequency @xmath122 would generally be affected by the size and configuration of the device .",
    "_ @xcite have also reported that @xmath122 can reach upwards of 20  ghz .",
    "it is important to note that the speed of the graphene transistor is influenced by the saturation of the drain current ( cf .",
    "recent studies by @xcite ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , the contact resistance between the metallic materials and graphene is hugely problematic , and even more serious than the undefined saturation drain current @xcite .",
    "researchers are looking for further developments to minimise this resistance .",
    "indeed , a long road lies ahead to implement electronic graphene devices into industry .",
    "one of the main reasons is that we can not maintain both the quantity and quality of graphene devices simultaneously throughout the manufacturing processes .",
    "for example , mechanical exfoliation can produce high quality graphene flakes , but only a small amount each time .",
    "chemical vapor deposition and evaporation of silicon carbide are able to mass produce graphene substrates - however , these methods require very high temperatures which may sometimes burn out the graphene structure .",
    "it is of utmost importance to develop more precise fabrication techniques to reduce the impurities and defects of graphene products @xcite .",
    "most current research is based in laboratories at huge financial expense .",
    "how to minimise the spending cost is the next issue to be overcome .",
    "it is highly important to open up a band - gap for the graphene switching devices , of which existing methodologies include carbon nanotubes @xcite , graphene nanoribbons , deformed structures and bilayer graphene .",
    "however , this normally leads to a downgrading of the mobility .",
    "one of the major problems for the graphene transistor is current leakage , and the absence of a well - defined on / off switching ratio .",
    "the tunneling transistor @xcite may be an innovative solution to this problem , in that it consumes less power and operates at a faster speed .",
    "graphene can also be used in high - frequency amplifiers which do not require a well - defined switching ratio .",
    "a recent theory reveals that speeds could even reach upwards of 1thz for photonic devices @xcite , although one must be careful with regards to the huge contact resistance and unknown saturation regions of a graphene transistor .",
    "some new concepts , such as the single electron transistor and quantum dot transistor , are of great interest , and are being applied to graphene in current research @xcite .",
    "some research groups are now looking for more stable two - dimensional materials , such as graphyne and silicene @xcite , both of which also possess very good mobility .",
    "both ohare _ et al._@xcite and drummond _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite further mention that the band - gap in silicene can be tuned by an applied electric field . nonetheless , for now , graphene remains a the forefront for understanding the nanoscale effects of the future generation of transistors @xcite .",

    "<S> the speed of silicon - based transistors has reached an impasse in the recent decade , primarily due to scaling techniques and the short - channel effect . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , graphene ( a revolutionary new material possessing an atomic thickness ) has been shown to exhibit a promising value for electrical conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> graphene would thus appear to alleviate some of the drawbacks associated with silicon - based transistors . </S>",
    "<S> it is for this reason why such a material is considered one of the most prominent candidates to replace silicon within nano - scale transistors . </S>",
    "<S> the major crux here , is that graphene is intrinsically gapless , and yet , transistors require a band - gap pertaining to a well - defined on / off logical state . therefore , exactly as to how one would create this band - gap in graphene allotropes is an intensive area of growing research . </S>",
    "<S> existing methods include nano - ribbons , bilayer and multi - layer structures , carbon nanotubes , as well as the usage of the graphene substrates . </S>",
    "<S> graphene transistors can generally be classified according to two working principles . </S>",
    "<S> the first is that a single graphene layer , nanoribbon or carbon nanotube can act as a transistor channel , with current being transported along the horizontal axis . </S>",
    "<S> the second mechanism is regarded as tunneling , whether this be band - to - band on a single graphene layer , or vertically between adjacent graphene layers . </S>",
    "<S> the high - frequency graphene amplifier is another talking point in recent research , since it does not require a clear on / off state , as with logical electronics . </S>",
    "<S> this paper reviews both the physical properties and manufacturing methodologies of graphene , as well as graphene - based electronic devices , transistors , and high - frequency amplifiers from past to present studies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we provide possible perspectives with regards to future developments .    ` </S>",
    "<S> preprint `    this is an updated version of our article , due to be published in contemporary physics ( sept 2013 ) . </S>",
    "<S> included are updated references , along with a few minor corrections . </S>",
