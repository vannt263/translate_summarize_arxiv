    "<S> introduction *    in a preceding paper @xcite , b. mller and myself addressed the question , how is `` qcd in medium '' modified as compared to `` qcd in vacuum '' when one attempts to extend well developed perturbative qcd techniques @xcite from high energy hadron - hadron collisions to ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the investigation of @xcite condensed in the derivation of a generalized form of qcd evolution equations that describe the time evolution of parton distributions in a nuclear medium , solutions of which i will present in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> this aspect is of great importance for the future ultra - relativistic heavy ion collider experiments at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , where new phenomena associated with `` qcd in medium '' are expected to clearly modify naive extrapolations from hadron - hadron collisions . </S>",
    "<S> although in the last couple of years , numerical simulations with qcd based monte carlo models @xcite have provided considerable new insight in the microscopic parton dynamics of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions , one is still far from a complete picture and a truly quantitative description . aside from the rather intransparent complexity of these computer simulations , </S>",
    "<S> one still relies on a substantial amount of phenomenological modeling of nuclear and dense medium effects due the current lack of better knowledge about the details of such mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> this is reflected by a very large uncertainty in quantitative predictions : although the different model calculations generally agree very well for @xmath0 collisions at collider energies , they differ in their predictions , for e.g. charged particle multiplicities , in heavy ion @xmath1 collisions by a factor of 2 or more .    </S>",
    "<S> these issues lead to the main motivation for this work , namely the necessity to go back to a simpler , but more fundamental and transparent level , and study within the firmly established framework of perturbative qcd ( rather than extending phenomenological model input ) the microscopic dynamics of quarks and gluons in the hot , ultra - dense environment that may be created in heavy ion collisions @xcite . in order to do so , it is inevitable to disentangle the various nuclear and medium effects from each other by investigating physical situations where such medium phenomena may be singled out , both in theoretical and experimental research . for instance , deep inelastic scattering on heavy nuclei @xcite , charmonium production by drell - yan processes in nuclei @xcite , energy loss of partons , jet quenching and multiple scattering phenomena in hadron - nucleus collisions @xcite , etc . , provide opportunities to explore nuclear modifications to the qcd parton picture that has been so successful in high energy particle physics .    as a first step in this direction , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a generalized form of the well known dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations @xcite was derived . in the framework of the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) @xcite , we obtained a set of coupled integro - differential equations for the _ time evolution _ </S>",
    "<S> ( rather than the @xmath2-evolution ) of the off - shell parton distribution functions in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the usual parton branching processes in vacuum , these evolution equations provide a self - contained description of interactions with the nuclear medium by accounting for stimulated branching processes , fusion and scattering processes , which are specific to qcd in medium . </S>",
    "<S> this approach resulted in a probabilistic description within perturbative qcd of the time variation of parton distributions as in non - equilibrium kinetic theory , however now including consistent treatment of off - shell propagation of partons , a concept that is absent in semiclassical transport theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the essential condition for the applicability of perturbative techniques is that the qcd factorization theorem @xcite holds also in the presence of dense nuclear matter , in which multiple interactions of the evolving partons with this nuclear medium may be separated in space - time by only very short distances . </S>",
    "<S> recent investigations by mclerran and venugopalan @xcite are encouraging in this direction , since they showed that a consistent perturbative calculation of parton structure functions at small values of the bjorken variable @xmath3 becomes possible when one considers the limit of a very thick nuclear target . </S>",
    "<S> the condition for the applicability of perturbative qcd is then that medium induced effects , such as color screening and rescattering , provide dynamical cut - offs on a scale short compared to the qcd renormalization scale @xmath4 .    exploring this insight , the present paper as a sequel to the work of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite employs the probabilistic parton cascade picture @xcite to describe the evolution of a parton shower inside nuclear matter , triggered by a highly excited initial quark or gluon . here </S>",
    "<S> i will start from the generalized evolution equations and solve for the parton spectra with respect to the variables time , longitudinal momentum and virtuality , under some idealizing assumptions about the composition of the nuclear medium . before going to the heart of the matter , let me remark the following : the approach is at this point in a yet idealized stage , since various unsettled problems are left out , and a number of simplifying approximations are made . </S>",
    "<S> still , it is a starting point which can be step by step improved , similarly maybe as the development of perturbative qcd in hard processes that started some 15 years ago . </S>",
    "<S> the main assumptions and approximations in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and in the present paper can be stated as follows :    ( </S>",
    "<S> i ) : :    factorization of short distance interactions of shower partons with    the nuclear medium from long range non - perturbative forces is assumed .    </S>",
    "<S> this means , even in the presence of dense medium where a parton can    encounter multiple successive interactions , a probabilistic    description of local , non - interfering interactions applies at    sufficiently high energies . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) : :    neglect of interference effects that affect particularly the softest    partons : destructive interference of interaction amplitudes in both ,    coherent succesive small angle emissions ( angular ordering ) , and    multiple sequential scatterings ( landau - pomerantchuk - migdal effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) : :    nuclear effects due to long range correlations , e.g. nuclear shadowing    ( antishadowing ) not associated with truly perturbative parton    interactions are ignored .    </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> sec . 2 </S>",
    "<S> is devoted to recall the intuitive picture developed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite of the probabilistic parton evolution in medium . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical framework is reviewed and the master equations describing the time development of the distribution of off - shell partons in a nuclear environment are summarized . </S>",
    "<S> sec . </S>",
    "<S> 3 then deals with linearizing and solving these equations analytically by making a number of simplifying assumptions regarding the nuclear medium . </S>",
    "<S> explicit closed solutions for parton showers initiated by an energetic time - like quark or gluon are obtained , which in the special case of absence of nuclear matter reduces to the well known lla solutions for parton distributions , however now time being the evolution variable rather than virtuality . some general features concerning the @xmath3-dependence as well as the influence of the nuclear density </S>",
    "<S> are discussed . </S>",

    "<S> * 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupled evolution equations for quarks , antiquarks and gluons in medium *    let me start by recalling the essential considerations of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that lead to the derivation of a coupled set of integro - differential equations for a system of off - shell quarks ( antiquarks ) @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) with flavors @xmath7 , and gluons @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> as will become clear , these boltzmann type equations describe the time evolution of parton cascades in a nuclear medium with account of off - shell propagation of time - like virtual partons . </S>",
    "<S> although as mentioned before , the evolution equations may be applied to a variety of physical situations , let me specify here for the purpose of lucidity a definite , though somewhat idealized scenario : consider a fast parton injected into infinitely extended nuclear matter by some highly localized process of space - time extent , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this _ primary _ </S>",
    "<S> parton then propagates through the nucleus and initiates a cascade or shower of _ secondary _ partons . </S>",
    "<S> the partons in the cascade can either radiate bremsstrahlung gluons or produce @xmath10-pairs , collide with partons of the nucleus ( the medium ) , or absorb nuclear partons . </S>",
    "<S> i will call such an event a _ parton shower _ or _ </S>",
    "<S> parton cascade_. </S>",
    "<S> i emphasize that i will explicitly distinguish between the _ shower partons _ on the one hand , and the _ nuclear partons _ on the other hand which initially are coherently bound in the wave function of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> also , for the time being , i consider here the evolution of a single cascade and therefore only account for interactions of the cascade with the medium , but neglect possible interactions between simultaneously evolving cascades .    </S>",
    "<S> the prototype reaction of such a scenario is a proton - nucleus ( @xmath11 ) collision at very high beam energy , where one may trigger on a high energy time - like quark or gluon that is produced at some point of time @xmath12 inside the heavy nucleus by a hard scattering , and single out the development of the resulting parton shower inside the nucleus with a sufficiently homogenous spatial density . for the description of such a parton cascade </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to choose the _ nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass frame _ ( cm@xmath13 ) @xcite in which each nucleon has the same value of longitudinal momentum @xmath14 , @xmath15 with @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the nuclear mass number , @xmath18 the nucleon mass , and @xmath19 is assumed . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at the rhic ( lhc ) the maximum available beam energy implies @xmath20 100 ( 3000 ) even for @xmath21 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> i will describe the longitudinal evolution of a parton shower along the _ shower axis _ ( @xmath22-axis ) , which i define parallel to the direction of momentum of the initiating primary parton . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to parametrize the four - momenta @xmath23 of the shower partons such that for the primary parton , @xmath24 whereas for the @xmath25 secondary parton , @xmath26 where @xmath27 can be either positive or negative depending on the partons direction of propagation along the @xmath22-axis . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath28 is assumed , and all rest masses are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to realize that energy and momentum are independent variables , since one is dealing with off - shell particles of virtuality @xmath29 with a continuous invariant mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the parton system is then described by the change of _ parton number densities _ , which are defined as @xmath30 or , when integrated over transverse momentum , @xmath31 the relation between the parton number densities ( [ axt ] ) to the single - particle phase - space distributions is expressed by the number of partons of type @xmath32 present at time @xmath33 @xmath34 with @xmath35 denoting the corresponding phase - space density of off - shell partons with virtuality @xmath36 in the phase - space volume @xmath37 around @xmath38 and @xmath39 at time @xmath33 , and @xmath40 in the second line representing the spatially integrated energy - momentum distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to describe the time evolution of the parton densities ( [ axt ] ) or ( [ axt1 ] ) one has to relate the change of the dynamical variables @xmath3 and @xmath2 with the laboratory time @xmath33 which plays the role of an external parameter rather than being an intrinsic kinematical quantity . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was shown , using time - dependent perturbation theory , that for the case of a parton shower evolving in vacuum ( i.e. by successive branchings only ) , one finds that the time scale for a branching chain , starting at @xmath41 with initial values @xmath42 and @xmath43 , is in the average given by @xmath44 with ( @xmath45 ) @xmath46 in accord with the uncertainty principle . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the absence of interactions with surrounding matter , the time variable @xmath33 is related to @xmath3 and and the degree of off - shellness @xmath2 by the typical life - time @xmath47 in the parton s restframe , boosted by the lorentz factor @xmath48 . however , when considering a parton shower inside nuclear matter , scattering and fusion processes with nuclear partons will compete with spontaneous branchings and consequently disrupt a steady decrease of average virtuality with time . </S>",
    "<S> both scatterings and fusions can increase the virtuality of a parton by energy - momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the relation ( [ tq ] ) between @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath33 can not be deterministic anymore , because interactions with the nuclear medium occur stochastically according to the density of nuclear partons . </S>",
    "<S> each scattering or fusion may `` rejuvenate '' a shower parton by providing it with a virtuality @xmath49 so that the parton after the interaction appears to be younger ( @xmath50 ) . to keep track of these repeated rejuvenations </S>",
    "<S> , one has to reset the clock for the particular shower parton after each such interaction with the medium . for this purpose a new independent dynamic variable @xmath51 , called the _ age of a parton _ , </S>",
    "<S> was introduced in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . instead of ( [ tq ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , one finds @xmath52 which determines the typical age of a parton depending on @xmath3 , @xmath2 and implicitely also on @xmath33 , and which introduces an additional time scale that reflects the external influence of the medium on the time evolution of the parton cascade . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the parton number densities ( [ axt ] ) and ( [ axt1 ] ) must be generalized as @xmath53 which now has the meaning of the probability density for finding a parton of type @xmath32 at time @xmath33 with age @xmath54 and momentum fraction @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the age variable measures here the influence of the nuclear medium on the development of the parton cascade . </S>",
    "<S> note that in absence of a background medium the age variable looses its independent character , i.e. it then evolves parallel to laboratory time and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> i will return to that point in sec . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> * 2.1 the evolution equations *    for the remainder of this paper i will be concerned only with transverse momentum integrated quantities , so that it suffices to describe the evolution in terms of the parton number densities @xmath5 , ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath8 , defined by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ axt2 ] ) . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , it is convenient to introduce the _ parton momentum densities _ @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 @xmath59 i.e. the parton number densities weighted with the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath3 , and integrated over all transverse momenta @xmath60 .    as graphically illustrated in fig . </S>",

    "<S> , the approach presented here has no truly predictive relevance for experimental observables yet . rather than that it may be a first step towards a more fundamental understanding of `` qcd in medium '' , using well developed methods of renormalization group improved perturbation theory for `` qcd in vacuum '' . </S>",
    "<S> i believe that the most important issues to be addressed in the near future within such a program are the following :    ( 1 ) : :    the rigorous distinction between the shower particles and the nuclear    partons needs to be dropped . instead both should be treated on the    same footing in order to describe a self - consistent dynamical    multi - parton system . </S>",
    "<S> this would then incorporate also time- and    @xmath3-dependent nuclear parton distributions that receive    modifications due to the response of the shower evolution . </S>",
    "<S> an    interesting aspect of such a dynamical interplay between scatterings ,    multiplication and recombination of partons is the question of a    possible saturation @xcite of the parton number densities that may    render a finite parton density as @xmath365 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) : :    in the context of nuclear structure , the relevance and the form of the    age distribution @xmath181 of vitual shower partons needs    to be studied , because it provides an interface between the nuclear    medium and the response of the cascading partons to this environment .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath181 may be experimentally accessible by    comparing inclusive quantities associated with parton evolution in    e.g. deep inelastic scattering experiments on hadrons versus heavy    nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this issue is of great interest from both theoretical as well    as experimental side . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) : :    interference effects which are important particularly in the small    @xmath3-domain need to be taken into account systematically .    </S>",
    "<S> these include two well known phenomena , namely , a ) the coherence of    successive soft gluon emissions in the parton cascade leading to    destructive interference and a suppression of gluon radiation , and , b )    the landau - pomerantchuk - migdal effect , i.e. the interference of    induced gluon emission amplitudes in multiple parton collisions , which    also causes a depletion in the gluon radiation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) : :    a possible extension to include the time development of the transverse    momentum distribution of partons as well as the lateral spread of    shower particles would be desirable . </S>",
    "<S> this would then provide a    solution to the cascade development in full four dimensional momentum    space , in virtuality @xmath2 , longitudinal and transverse    momentum components @xmath3 and @xmath60 ,    respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) : :    parallel to the previous items a comparison with a full    six - dimensional phase - space analysis , as e.g. possible with monte    carlo simulations @xcite , is of great importance to test the accuracy    of the analytical solutions . such a twofold investigation can be    explorative for both analytical and numerical solutions of the    evolution equations , in the sense that mutual feedback may lead to an    improved understanding of the microscopic parton dynamics in nuclear    matter . </S>"
