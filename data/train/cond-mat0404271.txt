    "the advent of mesoscopic quantum physics  @xcite in the early 1980s has profoundly influenced our understanding of transport in solids .",
    "advances in micro- and nano - fabrication technology have brought about small enough structures ( @xmath0 m ) in which , at low enough temperatures ( @xmath1k ) , propagation of an electron is described by a single wave function ( instead of density matrices in macroscopic solids ) since inelastic dephasing processes can be suppressed below the temperature - dependent dephasing length @xmath2 .",
    "thus , their transport properties have to be analyzed in terms of quantities that take into account non - local features of quantum dynamics ( such as the quantum corrections  @xcite to the conductivity which are non - local on the scale of @xmath2 ) , finite - size of the sample , boundaries , and measurement set - up of macroscopic external circuit , rather than using traditional local and self - averaging quantities ( such as the conductivity ) applicable to bulk materials at high enough temperatures .",
    "particularly influential ideas have emanated from the landauer - b \" uttiker approach  @xcite to quantum transport which treats conduction within the phase - coherent sample as a complicated ( multichannel ) quantum - mechanical scattering problem .",
    "this viewpoint introduces a set of transmission coefficients as the fundamental property of a mesoscopic conductor .",
    "the transmission coefficients @xmath3 are formally defined as the eigenvalues of @xmath4 , which is the product of a transmission matrix @xmath5 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath6 . in the two - probe geometry , where mesoscopic sample is attached to two semi - infinite ideal metallic leads",
    ", the @xmath5-matrix connects the transmission amplitudes of the flux - normalized states in the left lead to the outgoing states in the right lead .",
    "thus , the basis of eigenchannels , which diagonalizes the matrix @xmath4 , offers a simple intuitive picture where conductor can be viewed as a parallel circuit of independent transmission channels characterized by channel - dependent transmission probability @xmath3 . within this framework ,",
    "pure tunnel barrier is a rather simple case where all transmission eigenvalues @xmath7 are the same and much smaller than one ( the opposite limit , @xmath8 , is a property of the ballistic transport occurring through fully open conducting channels ) .    since many electronic devices employ quantum - mechanical tunneling through an insulating barrier , their design and optimization requires to understand whether transport occurs via pure tunneling or if it is affected also by the defects in the barrier .",
    "@xcite in particular , high - critical current density for josephson tunnel junctions  @xcite or impedance level for magnetic tunnel junctions  @xcite require ultrathin and highly transparent barriers that can easily be pushed out of the genuine tunneling regime .",
    "@xcite the diagnostics of non - trivial barrier properties requires to investigate quantities beyond just the conductance since its exponential decrease with the barrier thickness , as a naive criterion of pure tunneling , can be generated by vastly different underlying microscopic mechanisms .",
    "for example , recent experiments  @xcite have pointed out how homogeneous ultrathin ( e.g. , thickness @xmath9 nm ) aluminum oxide barriers can accommodate high transmission channels @xmath10 ( which are detrimental for various device operation  @xcite ) .",

    "the wave function associated with the localized states is confined within the region of a characteristic size specified by the localization length @xmath11 .    here",
    "we explore quantum transport through a strongly disordered barrier , separating the two clean metallic electrodes , by computing statistical properties of the transmission eigenvalues for an ensemble of three - dimensional ( 3d ) samples with different impurity configuration .",
    "we focus on the appearance of completely open transmission channels  @xcite @xmath10 , as the barrier thickness increases from the single interface limit to the junction thickness where tunneling through the anderson insulator takes place , and their effect on experimentally accessible transport properties . that is , the full statistics of @xmath3 allows us to obtain frequently measured quantities that contain the signatures of such non - trivial transparency properties : ( a ) the zero - frequency power spectrum of the shot noise ;  @xcite and ( b ) the conductance  @xcite @xmath12 of a hybrid junction composed of a thin anderson insulator attached to a superconductor , whose unusual properties have been unearthed in recent mesoscopic transport experiments .",

    "when anderson insulator samples become larger than @xmath2 , phonon - assisted tunneling allows charges to propagate by hopping between the localized sites thereby generating a finite conductance .",
    "however , the transport studied here takes place through phase - coherent barriers ( i.e. , their size satisfies @xmath77 ) and , therefore , effectively at zero temperature .",
    "the open channels inside the anderson insulator junctions are due to the tunneling via rather special configurations of localized states that provide a path for resonant transmission of electrons .",
