    "the psf profile is also presented with an arbitrary normalization for clarity .",
    "red and blue lines show @xmath4=0.34 and 0.68 in each panel .",
    "we can see that the surface brightness profile of a galaxy appears to be more compact at edge - on than at face - on when circular apertures are adopted .",
    "the bias becomes larger for late - type galaxies with larger @xmath3 .",
    "we measure the structural parameters from a radial surface brightness profile using the method described in section  [ recover ] .",

    "this is because such galaxies exhibit profiles with extended wings out to large radii , leading to an oversubtraction of the background and thus underestimate in both s@xmath1rsic index and effective radius .",

    "we can see that for late - type galaxies , the light beyond @xmath50 is negligible . for early - type galaxies , however , the light out of @xmath50 dramatically increases with the effective radius , and reaches up to 10% for galaxies with @xmath51 and @xmath3=15pixels .",

    "we conclude that elongation / inclination ( @xmath4 ) influences the estimate of structural parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 when the radial surface brightness profile is extracted from a galaxy image using circular apertures .",
    "the galaxy would appear to be more compact , i.e. , with larger @xmath2 and smaller @xmath3 , at decreasing @xmath4 , if the elongation / inclination is ignored .",

    "the recovered @xmath3 is systematically smaller by 12% to 27% over @xmath61pixels .",
    "for late - type galaxies , the degree of underestimate in @xmath3 does not depend on @xmath3 itself , suggesting that the @xmath4 distribution is responsible for the underestimate .",
    "but for early - type galaxies , the degree of underestimate in @xmath3 increases as the @xmath3 increases .",
    "given that the oversubtraction of background becomes more serious for early - type galaxies with larger size , it is reasonable to attribute the increase of the degree of underestimate in @xmath3 to the oversubtraction of background .",
    "apparently , the estimate of @xmath3 is more biased for late - type galaxies due to the highly - inclined ones ( @xmath5 ) which are absent in the early - type galaxies when the effective radius is not very large .",
    "similarly , @xmath2 is overestimated by up to 20% for late - type galaxies because of the inclination effect due to those with @xmath5 .",
    "again , the overestimate of @xmath2 does not rely on @xmath3 significantly .",
    "for early - type galaxies , @xmath2 can be underestimated up to 15% , and the underestimation of @xmath2 increases as @xmath2 increases . as most of them are with @xmath620.5 in terms of the @xmath4 distribution from @xcite , the overestimation of @xmath2 can be ignored for early - type galaxies , thus the oversubtraction of background dominates the estimation of @xmath2 and makes @xmath2 underestimated , especially for galaxies with larger @xmath2 which have more extended halo in the outskirts . as shown in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , the recovery of @xmath2 is marginally biased by inclination / elongation effects at @xmath620.5 .",
    "these results denote that the function of the @xmath4 distribution regulates the deviation of the recovered @xmath3 and @xmath2 from the original values for late - type galaxies , and the estimation of background affects the estimation of structural parameters for early - type galaxies .",
    "differing from the claim in @xcite that the recovery of structural parameters is not sensitive to the distribution of @xmath4 , we show that the @xmath4 distribution may significant bias the recovery of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , dependent on the fraction of highly - inclined or elongated ones ; the stacked profile appears to be more compact ( i.e. , with smaller @xmath3 and higher @xmath2 at the same time ) if the elongation / inclination effect is not corrected .",

    "as shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : fig6 ] , the input median effective radius @xmath40 is well recovered through stacking for late - type galaxies and early - type galaxies with small effective radius , but for early - type galaxies with large radius , the underestimation of @xmath3 can be up to 15% due to the oversubtraction of background .",
    "however , @xmath2 is increasingly overestimated by up to 60% at decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "this tendency has no dependence on the median of the log - normal distribution of @xmath3 . for early - type galaxies , the @xmath2",
    "can still be underestimated due to the oversubtraction of background .",
    "one can infer from figure  [ fig : fig6 ] that the median of a log - normal distribution of @xmath3 can be properly measured from the stacked profile of galaxies ; but the spread of @xmath3 leads to an overestimate of @xmath2 for late - type galaxies ( @xmath642.5 ) .",

    "the median @xmath40 is underestimated by 20%-27% and 10%-20% for late - type and early - type galaxies , depending on the @xmath3 of the galaxies , respectively , caused by the @xmath4 spread and the estimation of background ; and @xmath2 is increasingly overestimated by up to 70% at decreasing @xmath2 , equal to a linear combination of the deviations caused by each of the two spreads . in summary , our simulations manifest that the measured size ( @xmath3 ) and s@xmath1rsic index ( @xmath2 ) of the averaged profile by stacking a set of galaxies deviate from the input values when the stacked galaxies disperse in axis ratio ( @xmath4 ) and/or half - light radius ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the deviations depend on the type of stacked galaxies ( @xmath2 ) and distribution functions of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "the stacked profile tends to be more compact for late - type galaxies , and the oversubtraction of background dominates the estimation of structural parameters for early - type galaxies and make the profile to be smaller in both @xmath3 and @xmath2 . with given distributions of @xmath4 and/or @xmath3 , the deviations in estimates of @xmath3 and @xmath2 can be quantitatively determined and thus corrected accordingly .",
    "it is worth noting that the effects caused by the spread of @xmath2 depend strongly on the distribution function of @xmath2 .",
    "the averaged profile of a set of s@xmath1rsic profiles with fixed @xmath3 and @xmath4=1 is much close to the median one .",

    "however , it remains to be explored when two distinct types of profiles are stacked together .",
    "generally speaking , a set of galaxies of similar properties ( e.g. , stellar mass or color ) are often selected for stacking to derive their mean profile .",
    "for instance , galaxies are often divided into two populations : star - forming and quiescent .",
    "the star - forming galaxies tend to have sersic index between 1 and 2 and the quiescent galaxies have sersic index systematically higher . in order to test how the spread of @xmath2 affects the stacked results",
    ", we adopt a uniform distribution of @xmath2 between @xmath65 for late - type galaxies and @xmath66 for early - type galaxies , with fixed @xmath3 and @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig8 ] shows that the @xmath3 is almost identical to the input values for ltgs and small etgs , and for large etgs , the @xmath3 can be slightly underestimated due to the oversubtraction of background , which can be seen from figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the median s@xmath1rsic index can be recovered well for both late - type galaxies and early - type galaxies , though the recovered s@xmath1rsic index is slightly lower than the input median s@xmath1rsic index for the early - type galaxies with large effective radius .",
    "we account for the spreads in @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 together in our stacking exercises , and examine whether the averaged structural parameters can be well recovered through stacking .",

    "the presence of highly - inclined late - type galaxies is believed to cause the additional bias to the underestimate of the averaged effective radius .",
    "the median @xmath2 can be well recovered for early - type galaxies , but overestimated by @xmath67 for late - type galaxies .",

    "accounting the spreads of @xmath4 and @xmath3 for the disk component of bulge+disk models , we derive the structural parameters of the bulge and disk component of the stacked image of the models through dual - s@xmath1rsic profile fitting and show the results in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : fig13 ] .",
    "clearly , the @xmath4 and @xmath3 spreads affect the recovery of the structural parameters of the two components .",
    "while the average size of the disk component @xmath81 is systematically underestimated by about 20% , independent from @xmath71 , the average size of the bulge component @xmath82 is increasingly overestimated at decreasing @xmath71 , particularly for lower @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath71 is increasingly overestimated at decreasing @xmath71 .",
    "these biases in recovering the structural parameters are obviously caused by the inclined disks in stacking .",
    "the degree of bias in @xmath71 is strongly dependent on the intrinsic @xmath71 but free from @xmath78 .    along with the spreads of @xmath4 and @xmath83 added to disks , the spread in bulge @xmath83",
    "is also included in stacking of bulge+disk models .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : fig13 ] presents the recovered structural parameters using the method of dual - s@xmath1rsic fitting to the global 1-d profile of the stacked model image .",
    "again , the recovered structural parameters deviate from the input ones .",
    "the deviations of @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath84 are similar to what given in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : fig13 ] , suggesting that the bulge @xmath83 spread has little influence on the estimate of the averaged structural parameters of the stacked bulge+disk models . and",
    "the biases in @xmath82 and @xmath84 are mainly caused by the @xmath4 and @xmath3 spreads of the disk component .",
    "not all bulges are classical type with a s@xmath1rsic index of @xmath2=4 . in fact , many bulges with smaller s@xmath1rsic indices in the local universe are recognized as pseudo bulges and thought to be built up through secular evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . for high-@xmath0 galaxies , the bulges formed through inward migration of disk clumps",
    "are expected to differ from the classical ones which are usually formed via mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the pseudo bulges are less distinct from disks compared to the classical bulges , it is important to examine how the global properties depend on the model parameters and to what degree the pseudo bulge component can be resolved through a dual - s@xmath1rsic profile fitting to a 1-d surface brightness profile .",
    "we therefore repeat the simulations in section  [ subsec : two ] but set @xmath2=2.5 for the bulge component .    again",
    ", we derive global structural parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 by fitting single s@xmath1rsic profiles to the simulated profiles in three cases : individual pseudo bulge+disk models , stacking of pseudo bulge+disk models with @xmath4 and @xmath3 spreads added to the disk component , and stacking of such models with @xmath3 spread added to the bulge component and @xmath4 and @xmath3 spreads added to the disk component .",
    "table  [ tab : pseudo ] lists the results only for @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig14 ] shows recovery results of the global structural parameters . similar to those present in figure  [ fig : fig12 ] : the recovered global @xmath72 increases from 1 to 2.5 as @xmath71 increases from 0 to 1 ; when @xmath71 is fixed , a lower ratio @xmath78 generally leads @xmath72 to be slightly higher ; the global size can be approximately seen as the light - weighted combination of @xmath70 and @xmath69 ; the recovered parameters agree well with the reference parameters ( triangles ) derived from the psf - free models ; the @xmath4 and @xmath3 spreads of the disk component leaves the global s@xmath1rsic index increasingly overestimated and the global size increasingly underestimated at decreasing @xmath71 ; the @xmath3 spread of the pseudo bulge component has insignificant influence to the global structural parameters .",
    "we point out that fitting the stacked profiles of pseudo - bulge+disk models with dual - s@xmath1rsic profile results in similar results for classical bulge+disk models presented in figure  [ fig : fig13 ] if the two s@xmath1rsic profiles have @xmath54 for one ( disk ) and @xmath86 for the other ( pseudo bulge ) .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to see how the recovery of structural parameters are affected when @xmath74 is adopted as the bulge component in the dual - s@xmath1rsic profile fitting .",
    "accordingly , the recovered @xmath70 , @xmath69 and @xmath71 as a function of input @xmath71 are presented in figure  [ fig : fig15 ] , for individual pseudo bulge+disk models , stacking of these models with the spreads of @xmath4 and @xmath3 included into the disk component , and stacking of these models with @xmath4 spread counted for the disk component and @xmath3 spread for both components , respectively .    when the pseudo - bulge in the pseudo bulge+disk models is mistaken as a classical one",
    ", the bulge+disk decomposition ends up with an increasing underestimate of @xmath71 ( also @xmath70 and @xmath69 ) with increasing input @xmath71 .",
    "this is understandable in that the pseudo bulge component is divided into a classical bulge and an additional disk . at @xmath87 , the additional disk biases the recovered @xmath69 smaller .",
    "taking the spreads of @xmath4 and @xmath3 into account , the recovery of the averaged structural parameters of @xmath82 , @xmath81 and @xmath84 from the stacked profile of pseudo bulge+disk models is further affected mainly by the @xmath4 and @xmath3 spreads of the disk , as described in section  [ subsec : dual ] .",
    "stacking technique is a powerful tool to probe signals under the detection limit of individual images for faint galaxies and enable us to obtain the averaged surface brightness profile toward larger radii .",
    "we carried out simulations to test the stacking of galaxy models with spreads in axis ratio ( @xmath4 ; elongation or inclination ) and effective radius ( @xmath3 ) counted , and to explore how the recovered structural parameters of the averaged surface brightness profile depend on the effective radius ( @xmath3 ) , axis ratio ( @xmath4 ) , index of s@xmath1rsic profile ( @xmath2 ) of the models and their spreads .",
    "we also addressed the recovery of averaged structural parameters through stacking bulge+disk models in order to simulate the real observations .    in our simulations , we use circular apertures to derive surface brightness profile of a galaxy image .",
    "this is the usual way for stacking of faint high-@xmath0 galaxies , whose structural parameters are barely known so that corrections for inconsistence in inclination , orientation and size are often ignored .",
    "following @xcite , we fit the one - dimensional ( 1-d ) radial surface brightness profile of a stacked galaxy image with a library of 1-d s@xmath1rsic profiles to obtain the best - fit profile using the method of least squares . the best - fit profile is taken as the intrinsic profile for the stacked image .",
    "galaxy models used in our simulations have structural parameters spanning sufficiently wide ranges : @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we examined 1 ) the dependence of the measured surface brightness profile solely on each parameter of @xmath30 and @xmath4 ; 2 ) the recovery of structural parameters of the mean surface brightness profile when a set of galaxy models for stacking have two parameters fixed and the third parameter spreading within a certain distribution ; 3 ) the recovery of structural parameters of the mean surface brightness profile of galaxy models with spreads counted in both @xmath4 and @xmath3 as functions of @xmath2 and mean effective radius @xmath34 ; 4 ) the recovery of structural parameters of the mean surface brightness profile of galaxy models with spreads added to all parameters , including @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , for late - type and early - type galaxies ; 5 ) the fitting of the stacked profile of bulge+disk models with both single s@xmath1rsic profiles and dual - s@xmath1rsic profiles to see to which extent the stacking can recover the averaged structural parameters of a galaxy population .",
    "the striking results from our simulations are that the structural parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the mean - stacked image of a group of galaxies may be biased up to 70% by spreads in @xmath4 and @xmath3 , much dependent on the distribution functions of the spreads ; the bias can be quantitatively corrected once the spread functions are known .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    * the spread in @xmath4 leads the mean - stacked image of a group galaxies to appear more compact , i.e. , with a lower mean effective radius @xmath34 and a higher @xmath2 . the inclusion of highly - inclined ( or elongated ) galaxies with low @xmath4 in stacks biases the recovered @xmath2 and @xmath34 . * for early - type galaxies with large s@xmath1rsic index @xmath2 , which have extended halos in the outskirts , the oversubtraction of background biases the estimate of structural parameters",
    "the mean s@xmath1rsic index @xmath2 may be underestimated , and the effective radius @xmath3 may be underestimated for early - type galaxies with large sizes .",
    "this indicates that the estimation of background is very important for the estimation of structural parameters , especially for early - type galaxies which have extended halos in the outskirts . *",
    "accounting for the @xmath4 spread of local disk galaxies from @xcite in stacking galaxies with @xmath88 , the median effective radius @xmath34 of the stacked galaxies is underestimated by 23% and the mean s@xmath1rsic index @xmath2 is overestimated by up to 20% .",
    "similarly , the @xmath4 spread of local early - type galaxies from @xcite in stacking galaxies with @xmath89 leads to an underestimate of 12% in @xmath34 and little influence on the estimate of @xmath2 . *",
    "the spread in @xmath3 plays a different role from that of the spread in @xmath4 , which leads the mean - stacked profile of galaxies to be more concentrated . taking the log - normal distribution of @xmath3 from @xcite into account ,",
    "@xmath34 is not biased for either early - type or late - type galaxies , and s@xmath1rsic index @xmath2 is overestimated by 50% for the late - type galaxies but not significantly biased for the early - type galaxies . when @xmath3 scatters within a spread , the stacked galaxies with a size smaller than the median contribute more to the central part of the integrated light , and those with a size larger than the median contribute more to the extended wing , resulting in a mean - stacked profile with a higher s@xmath1rsic index and an effective radius equal to the median of the @xmath3 spread . *",
    "the effects of the spreads in @xmath4 and @xmath3 are linearly co - added on the estimate of structural parameters of a stacked image .",
    "the actual corrections for these effects rely on the spread functions .",
    "* account for the spread of @xmath2 with a uniform distribution , we find that the recovered structural parameters remain unchanged compared with these derived with no spread in @xmath2 counted , suggesting that the spread of @xmath2 does not significantly effect on the stacked results . * in stacking analysis , the galaxies are often classified by the stellar mass and type , and the @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 all have spreads . in this case , we find that the effective radius @xmath3 can be underestimated by 20% to 27% for late - type galaxies , and only 10% to 15% for early - type galaxies , due to the @xmath4 distribution of galaxies .",
    "the s@xmath1rsic index @xmath2 can be well recovered for early - type galaxies , but can be overestimated for late - type galaxies due to both the @xmath4 and @xmath3 distribution . * for faint galaxies ,",
    "the center we find will have an offset to the real center of galaxies due to the noise .",
    "we also test this effect by stacking galaxies by using the real center instead of the center found by sextractor .",
    "we find that for galaxies in the range @xmath68mag , the 68% percentile of the centering offset is not more than 1pixel and does not influence the results .",
    "* recovery of structural parameters of bulge+disk galaxies are regulated by the bugle - to - total ratio @xmath71 , the @xmath3 ratio of the two components and the s@xmath1rsic index of the bulge if the disk is exponential ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the global s@xmath1rsic index @xmath72 mainly depends on s@xmath1rsic index of the bulge and @xmath71 .",
    "the global effective radius @xmath73 can be approximately seen as the light - weighted combination of bulge size @xmath70 and disk size@xmath69 .",
    "and the ratio @xmath78 also has influence on @xmath72 at a second - order level .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath3 spreads of the disks and the @xmath3 spread of the bulges lead @xmath72 to be increasingly overestimated and @xmath73 to be increasingly underestimated at decreasing @xmath71 . * by dual - s@xmath1rsic profile fitting to the stacked profile of bulge+disk galaxies ,",
    "the averaged structural parameters of the bulge and disk components can be determined although the uncertainties are large .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath3 spreads of disks is the main cause of the increasing overestimate of @xmath71 ( also @xmath70 ) at decreasing intrinsic @xmath71 .",
    "the issue of the bulges to be pseudo or classical would dramatically change the results of the dual - s@xmath1rsic profile fitting for a composite profile .",
    "we caveat that the measurement of bulge growth in a statistical sense is significantly affected by the @xmath4 and @xmath3 spreads of the disks and s@xmath1rsic index of the bulges in the bulge+disk decomposition through stacking .",
    "we thus stress that interpretation of stacking results should take these biases into account and the corrections for the biases are strongly dependent on the structural parameters of stacked galaxies and the spread functions of them .",
