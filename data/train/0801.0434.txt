    "the success of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) in describing hard processes in hadronic interactions relies on the factorization theorem @xcite that separates the coherent long distance interaction between projectile and target from the incoherent short distance interactions .",

    ". though the parton distribution and fragmentation functions are not calculable in pqcd since they involve long distance interaction , they are universal and independent of the specific partonic hard processes .",
    "therefore , they can be measured in one hard process and then applied to another , therein lies the predictable power of pqcd .",
    "the most practiced factorization scheme is collinear factorization in which one integrates out the transverse momentum of the initial ( final ) parton up to a factorization scale and the final observables will only depend on the transverse - momentum - integrated or collinear factorized parton distribution ( fragmentation ) functions .",
