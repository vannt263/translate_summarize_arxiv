    "when gene trees are estimated from multiple lineages taken from two or more populations , there is an increased chance that lineages within each population form monophyletic groups compared to sampling multiple lineages from a single population .",
    "this observation has led to the adoption of a null hypothesis that a set of lineages belongs to a single population or taxonomic group , in asking whether a particular group of lineages came from a taxonomically distinct population @xcite .",
    "statistical tests for reciprocal monophyly between two sister taxa can then be developed to test against this null hypothesis @xcite .",
    "reciprocal monophyly is central to the genealogical species concept . according to this concept",
    "two groups come from different species if they form distinct monophyletic groups @xcite .",
    "gene trees from lineages sampled from one or more populations are typically estimated , and monophyly ( or lack of monophyly ) of these groups can be observed from the clades of the gene tree .",
    "statistical tests for whether observed levels of monophyly provide sufficient evidence to conclude that a group is taxonomically distinct can be performed , given a probabilistic model for the clades on a tree @xcite .    two neutral models  involving different evolutionary scales  are useful in this context .",
    "the yule ( pure birth , or birth - death ) model describes the speciation ( and extinction ) of lineages at the species level as one moves forward in time , while kingman s coalescent process is a population genetic model that the ancestry of individual lineages back in time as they coalesce ( and thereby form a tree ) .",
    "these are two quite different processes and lead to different branch lengths on trees ; remarkably , however , they generate identical distributions of tree topologies @xcite . thus , while the coalescent process is a natural model for trees in single populations , the equivalence of the yule and coalescent models for tree topologies means that results for the yule model can be exploited in studying probabilities of clades for coalescent trees in single populations .",
    "although there has been an emphasis on testing for the taxonomic distinctiveness of one group of lineages , joint probabilities of clades could be used to examine whether the observed monophyly of several groups is statistically significant using a single test .",
    "such an omnibus test of the null hypothesis that all groups come from one population might be more powerful than testing several groups one at time .    in this note , we derive exact formulae for the joint probabilities of @xmath0 clades for a random yule / coalescent gene tree under the conditions that the @xmath0 clades are mutually exclusive ( they have no leaves of the gene tree in common ) , and are either exhaustive ( all leaves of the gene tree occur in one of the @xmath0 clades ) , or form only a subset of the leaves of the gene tree .",
    "these results generalize results from @xcite , which provided an explicit formula for the probability that two mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets of leaves formed clades on a yule / coalescent gene tree .",
    "in addition , we extend the results to unrooted trees by giving the probabilities of ` clans ' ( sets of leaves that are all on one side of a split @xcite ) , as well as the joint probability of @xmath1 clans , on yule / coalescent trees which have been unrooted . this extension is relevant when only unrooted trees can be estimated , which is particularly common in prokaryotic evolution @xcite .",
    "throughout this paper we will let @xmath2 ( or , more briefly , @xmath3 ) denote a set of taxa of size @xmath4 .",
    "given a rooted phylogenetic @xmath3tree @xmath5 ( more briefly @xmath6 ) , with leaf set @xmath7 , a _ clade of @xmath6 _ is a subset of @xmath3 that corresponds to the set of leaves that are descended from any internal vertex .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the sets @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two clades .",
    "any two clades @xmath10 and @xmath11 of @xmath6 satisfy the following _ compatibility _ condition : @xmath12 this is equivalent to requiring that @xmath13 , one set is a strict subset of the other , or the two sets are disjoint .",
    "we will let @xmath14 denote the set of clades of @xmath6 , and say that a clade is _ proper _ if it is a strict subset of @xmath3 .",
    "notice that a rooted phylogenetic tree @xmath3tree has at most @xmath15 clades , and it has precisely this number if and only the tree is _ binary _ , that is , if each non - leaf vertex has two descendant vertices .",
    "consider the probability distribution on binary phylogenetic @xmath3trees described by a model that grows a tree by selecting a leaf uniformly at random and ` splitting ' it into two new leaves , as illustrated in fig .",
    "since we are ignoring branch lengths in this paper and concentrating just on tree topologies , the resulting probability distribution on rooted binary tree topologies is the same as that given by any ( stationary or non - stationary ) birth - death process on trees in which birth ( speciation ) and death ( extinction ) events apply exchangeably to all the species extant at any given moment ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "this is useful , since the rates of speciation and extinction throughout time may be both time - dependent and variable according to the number of taxa present @xcite .",
    "the study of such pure - birth trees was initiated in yule s 1925 paper @xcite , and the probability distribution on tree topologies ( without reference to branch lengths ) was further studied by harding @xcite . moreover",
    ", this probability distribution on trees is precisely the same as that given by a quite different process , namely kingman s coalescent process @xcite in population genetics , which starts at the leaves and successively combines pairs of elements , provided that , once again , we ignore branch lengths ( @xcite ) .    to emphasize this equivalence between a model in macro - evolution ( speciation and extinction ) and micro - evolution ( population genetics )",
    "we will refer to it as the _ yule - harding - kingman ( yhk ) _",
    "process for generating tree topologies .",
    "we will also refer to a random binary phylogenetic @xmath3tree produced by any of these stochastically equivalent processes as @xmath16 ( or often just @xmath17 if @xmath3 is clear ) , and so @xmath18 is the probability that @xmath6 is the actual phylogenetic @xmath3tree produced by the process . the process , viewed as a pure - birth model , is illustrated in fig .",

    "the two properties that the yhk process enjoys , and which we will exploit throughout this paper , are the following :    * if @xmath21 is obtained from @xmath6 by permuting its leaves , then @xmath22 * for any proper ( and non - empty ) subset @xmath10 of @xmath3 , and any rooted binary phylogenetic tree @xmath6 with leaf set @xmath23 : @xmath24    property ( ep ) is the _ exchangeability _ property @xcite , which requires that the probability of a particular phylogenetic tree depends just on its shape and not on how its leaves are labeled ( it is called ` label - invariance ' in @xcite ) .",
    "property ( ge ) is the _ group elimination _",
    "property from @xcite ; it states that , conditional on @xmath10 forming a clade in the tree , the tree structure on the remaining taxa is also described by the yhk process . in turn ( ge ) implies the following _ sampling consistency _",

    "the following result is stated and established in the appendix of @xcite ; it is also stated and proved in @xcite ( theorem 4.4 ) , and in @xcite ( proposition 2 ) .",
    "a further proof of this result is also possible based on induction on @xmath4 and using the well - known property of the yhk model that the number of leaves in one of the ( randomly selected ) maximal subtrees of @xmath16 is uniformly distributed between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    [ early ]",

    "moreover , under this condition , @xmath207 and @xmath208 are clans of @xmath6 if and only if @xmath211 and @xmath212 are clans of @xmath6 ; as these are disjoint sets , the second part of proposition  [ connectprop ] follows from theorem [ unroothm ] .",
    "the arguments we have used in our analysis have primarily relied on repeated application of the properties of exchangeability ( ep ) and group elimination ( ge ) ( or its corollary , sampling consistency ( sc ) ) for the yhk model , together with lemmas [ lemclus ] and [ baslem ] .",

    "indeed the distribution that assigns each rooted binary phylogenetic tree on @xmath2 the same probability ( sometimes known as the ` proportional to distinguishable arrangements ' , or pda model ) satisfies both ( ep ) and ( ge ) @xcite .",
    "this suggests that by finding and applying the corresponding results to lemma [ lemclus ] and [ baslem ] for the pda model , one could develop a parallel line of results for the pda model to most of the analysis we have provided in this paper for the yhk model .",
    "unfortunately only one other model , apart from pda and yhk , is known to satisfy both ( ep ) and ( ge ) and this model is not of biological interest , as it only generates pectinate ( comb - like ) tree shapes .",
    "aldous @xcite has conjectured that these are the _ only _ three distributions on rooted binary phylogenetic trees that that satisfy both ( ep ) and ( ge ) .",
    "nonetheless , it may be of interest to explore models that satisfy weakened assumptions - for example , ( ep ) and ( sc ) , or just ( ep ) .    even with ( ep ) alone",

    "for example , suppose @xmath213 taxa include one or more particular ( disjoint ) subsets ( different ` types ' of taxa ) @xmath99 , where @xmath214 .",

    "then we have the following result , the proof of which is given in the appendix .",
    "[ proptest ] for any probability distribution on rooted binary trees satisfying the exchangeability property ( ep ) , we have : @xmath216 where @xmath100 .    as a simple example , suppose we have @xmath217 taxa , including two disjoint groups , each containing six taxa . for a tree generated under any model that satisfies the exchangeability property ,",
