    "the physical picture underlying nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics is that of charged particles which interact through the exchange of photons and dissipate energy through emission of photons . in situations where the velocities of the particles are small compared to the propagation speed of the photons",
    "the interaction is given through effective , instantaneous pair potentials .",
    "if , in addition , also accelerations are small , then dissipation through radiation can be neglected in good approximation . instead of full nonrelativistic qed",
    "we consider the massless nelson model .",
    "this model describes @xmath0 _ spinless _ particles coupled to a _",
    "scalar _ bose field of zero mass .",
    "the content of this work is a mathematical derivation of the time - dependent schrdinger equation for @xmath0 particles with coulombic pair potentials from the massless nelson model with ultraviolet cutoffs .",
    "the key mechanism in our derivation is adiabatic decoupling _ without _ a spectral gap .",
    "before we turn to a more careful discussion of the type of scaling we shall consider , notice that the coupling of @xmath0 _ noninteracting _ particles to the radiation field has _",
    "three _ effects .",
    "* the effective mass , or more precisely , the effective dispersion relation of the particles is modified .",
    "the term `` effective '' refers to the reaction of the particles to weak external forces .",
    "the physical picture is that each particle now carries a cloud of photons with it , which makes it heavier . *",
    "the particles feel an interaction mediated through the field",
    ". if the propagation speed of the particles is small compared to the one of the photons , then retardation effects should be negligible and the interaction between the particles can be described in good approximation by instantaneous pair potentials .",
    "* energy is dissipated through photons moving freely to infinity .",
    "the motion of the particles is , in general , no longer of hamiltonian type .",
    "the rate of energy emitted as photons is proportional to the acceleration of a particle squared .",
    "the scaling to be studied is most conveniently explained on the classical level .",
    "the classical equations of motion for @xmath0 particles with positions @xmath1 , masses @xmath2 and rigid `` charge '' distributions @xmath3 coupled to the scalar field @xmath4 with propagation speed @xmath5 are @xmath6 one can think of @xmath7 as a smeared out point charge @xmath8 with a form factor @xmath9 satisfying @xmath10 .",
    "taking the limit @xmath11 in ( [ clf ] ) yields the poisson equation for the field and thus , after elimination of the field , ( [ clp ] ) describes @xmath0 particles interacting through smeared coulomb potentials .",
    "mass renormalization for the particles in not visible at leading order .    instead of taking @xmath11 one",
    "can as well explore for which scaling of the particle properties one obtains analogous effective equations .",
    "since retardation effects should be negligible , the initial velocities of the particles are now assumed to be @xmath12 compared to the fixed propagation speed @xmath13 of the field , @xmath14 . in order to see motion of the particles over finite distances",
    ", we have to follow this dynamics at least over times of order @xmath15 . to make sure that the velocities are still of order @xmath12 after times of order @xmath15 ,",
    "the accelerations must be at most of order @xmath16 .",
    "the last constraint also guarantees that the energy dissipated over times of order @xmath15 is at most of order @xmath17 .",
    "the natural procedure would now be to consider such initial data , for which the velocities stay of order @xmath12 over sufficiently long times .",
    "the problem simplifies if we assume , as we shall do in this work , that the mass of a particle is of order @xmath18 . as",
    "a consequence accelerations are and stay of order @xmath16 _",
    "uniformly for all initial conditions_. in this scaling limit mass renormalization is _ not _ visible at leading order . indeed ,",
    "if we substitute @xmath19 and @xmath20 in ( [ clf ] ) and ( [ clp ] ) , we find that the limit @xmath21 is equivalent to the limit @xmath22 .",
    "after quantization , however , the two limiting procedures are no longer equivalent .",
    "the limit @xmath11 for the nelson model was analyzed by davies @xcite and later also by hiroshima @xcite , who removed the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "a comparison of their results with ours can be found at the end of this introduction .",
    "we will adopt the point of view that it is more natural to explore the regime of particle properties which gives rise to effective equations than to take the limit @xmath22 .",
    "the deeper reason for our choice is that the more natural procedure of restricting to appropriate initial conditions gives rise to a similar mathematical structure .",
    "if the bare mass of the particles of order @xmath23 , then the proper scaling which yields effective equations with renormalized masses was introduced and analyzed for the classical abraham model by kunze and spohn , see @xcite and references therein . denoting again the ratio of the velocities of the particles and the field as @xmath24 , they consider charges initially separated by distances of order @xmath18 in units of their diameter .",
    "hence the forces are @xmath25 initially . for times",
    "up to order @xmath26 and for appropriate initial conditions  excluding head on collisions  the separation of the particles remains of order @xmath18 and thus the velocities remain of order @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , the rescaled macroscopic position @xmath27 satisfies @xmath28 , which matches the order of the forces . as a consequence one obtains a sensible limiting dynamics for the macroscopic variables .",
    "one would expect that the same scaling limit applied to the quantum mechanical model yields in a similar fashion effective dynamics with renormalized dispersion .",
    "however , inserting this scaling into the massless nelson model , one faces mathematical problems beyond those in the simpler @xmath29 scaling . without going into details",
    "we remark that the main problem is that for massless bosons the hamiltonian at fixed total momentum does not have a ground state in fock space , cf .",
    "( as a consequence it is not even clear how to translate the result in @xcite for a _ single quantum _ particle coupled to a _ massive _ quantized scalar field and subject to weak external forces to the massless case . ) nevertheless , the simpler scaling with @xmath29 provides at least a first step in the right direction , since the mechanism of adiabatic decoupling without gap will certainly play a crucial role also in a more refined analysis .    in the remainder of the introduction we briefly present the massless nelson model , explain our main result and compare it to davies `` weak coupling limit '' @xcite .    up to a modified dispersion for the particles ,",
    "the following model is obtained through canonical quantization of the classical system ( [ clf ] ) and ( [ clp ] ) .",
    "the state space for @xmath0 spinless particles is @xmath30 and as hamiltonian we take @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the maximally attainable speed of the particles and @xmath33 their mass , @xmath34 . as explained before",
    ", we consider the scaling limit @xmath35 it might seem somewhat artificial to have a relativistic dispersion relation for the particles which does not contain the speed of light , but some other maximal speed @xmath32 .",
    "this is done only for the sake of simple presentation .",
    "we could as well consider the quadratic dispersion @xmath36 for the particles .",
    "however , there would be no maximal speed and we would be forced to either introduce a cutoff for large momenta or to change the topology in ( [ result ] ) . while both strategies are technically straightforward by using exactly the same methods as in @xcite in the context of born - oppenheimer approximation , they would obscure the simple structure of our result .",
    "we insert the scaling ( [ scaling ] ) into ( [ hp1def ] ) and change units such that the particle hamiltonian is now given through @xmath37 the particles are coupled to a scalar field whose state is an element of the bosonic fock space over @xmath38 given as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath33-times symmetric tensor product and @xmath41 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the free bosonic field is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the boson momentum . in our units",
    "the propagation speed of the bosons is equal to one .",
    "the reader who is not familiar with the notation is asked to consult the beginning of section 3 , where the model is introduced in full detail .    in the standard nelson model the coupling between the @xmath44 particle and the field",
    "is given through @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the field operator in position representation and @xmath47 the position of the @xmath44 particle .",
    "the charge density @xmath48 of the @xmath44 particle is assumed to be spherically symmetric and its fourier transform is denoted by @xmath49 . for the moment we also assume an infrared condition , namely that @xmath50 condition ( [ ircon ] ) constrains the total charge of the system but _ not _ that of an individual particle to zero .",
    "the state of the combined particles + field system is an element of @xmath51 and its time evolution is generated by the hamiltonian @xmath52 note that @xmath53 contains no terms which directly couple different particles .",
    "all interactions between the particles must be mediated through the boson field .",
    "our goal is the construction of approximate solutions of the time dependent schrdinger equation @xmath54 from solutions of an effective schrdinger equation @xmath55 for the particles only .",
    "notice the factor @xmath24 in front of the time derivative in ( [ sfull ] ) and ( [ seff ] ) , which means that we switched to a time scale of order @xmath56 in microscopic units .",
    "as explained before , this is necessary in order to see nontrivial dynamics of the particles , since their speed is @xmath12 .",
    "we remark that the scaling ( [ scaling ] ) coincides with the one in time - dependent born - oppenheimer approximation , where @xmath29 is the mass of the nuclei and where , at fixed kinetic energy , the velocities of the nuclei are also of order @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hepsidef ] ) has the same structure as the molecular hamiltonian and the role of the electrons in the born - oppenheimer approximation is now played by the bosons .",
    "the key observation for the following is that the interaction hamiltonian depends only on the configuration @xmath57 of the particles and that the operator @xmath58 which acts on @xmath59 for fixed @xmath60 , has a unique ground state @xmath61 with ground state energy @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xmath65 is the electrostatic interaction energy of the charge distributions @xmath66 and @xmath3 at distance @xmath67 , however , with the `` wrong '' sign .",
    "it is a peculiarity of the scalar field that the interaction between charges with equal sign is attractive .",
    "@xmath68 is the sum of all self energies .",
    "the remainder of the spectrum is purely absolutely continuous and the ground state energy is _ not _ isolated , cf .",
    "figure 1 .",
    "let @xmath69 , then the states in @xmath70 correspond to wave packets without free bosons . if the particles are moving at small speeds and if the accelerations are also small , one expects that no free bosons are created , i.e.  that ran@xmath71 is approximately invariant under the dynamics generated by @xmath72 .",
    "moreover the wave function @xmath73 of the particles should approximately be governed by the effective schrdinger equation ( [ seff ] ) with @xmath74 our main result , theorem [ nelsontheorem ] , states that for @xmath75 ran@xmath71 we have @xmath76 notice that in the approximate solution of the full schrdinger equation the state of the field is , up to a fast oscillating global phase @xmath77 , adiabatically following the motion of the particles .",
    "in particular , there are no bosons traveling back and forth between the particles and the phrase that the particles `` interact through the exchange of bosons '' , which comes from perturbation theory , should not be taken literally in the present setting .    as mentioned before",
    ", there is a strong similarity to the time - dependent born - oppenheimer approximation , where one obtains an effective schrdinger equation for the nuclei in a molecule with an effective potential generated by the electrons @xcite . in both cases the physical mechanism which leads to the approximate invariance of the subspace ran@xmath71 is adiabatic decoupling .",
    "i.e.  the separation of time scales for the motion of the different parts of the system lets the fast degrees of freedom , in our case the bosons , instantaneously adjust to the motion of the slow degrees of freedom , the particles .",
    "however , for massless bosons  in contrast to the born - oppenheimer approximation  there is no spectral gap which pointwise separates the energy band @xmath78 from the remainder of the spectrum of @xmath79 , but @xmath80 lies at the bottom of continuous spectrum .",
    "hence we need a space - adiabatic theorem , cf .",
    "@xcite , _ without _ gap condition .",
    "only recently time - adiabatic theorems without a gap condition were established in @xcite .",
    "the notion time - adiabatic refers to the setting where the hamiltonian of the system is itself time - dependent and varies on a slow time scale . in section 2 a general space - adiabatic theorem without gap condition is formulated and proved .",
    "the proof is based on ideas developed in @xcite and our approach gives , in particular , good control on the rate of convergence in the adiabatic limit .    as an application of the result from section 2 we consider in section 3 the scaling limit @xmath21 of the massless nelson model as described above .",
    "we emphasize at this point that , in view of the missing gap condition , the rate of convergence @xmath81 in ( [ result ] ) is surprisingly fast , since it is almost as good as in the case with a gap .",
    "moreover , if all particles have individually total charge equal to zero , then the rate is exactly @xmath12 as in the case with a gap .",
    "hence , the logarithmic correction must be attributed to the coulombic long range character of the interparticle interaction . in the situation with gap",
    "it is known @xcite that the wave function stays in a subspace ran@xmath82 which is @xmath24-close to the band subspace ran@xmath71 up to an error of order @xmath83 .",
    "however , in the situation without gap , we expect that a piece of order @xmath84 , @xmath85 , of the wave function is `` leaking out '' of ran@xmath71 in the sense that it becomes orthogonal to ran@xmath71 under time evolution .",
    "physical considerations suggest that @xmath86 for the present problem , see remark [ leakrem ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath87 corrections to the effective hamiltonian are still dominating dissipation and can be formally derived from the results in @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( [ darwin ] ) then contains a renormalized mass term and the momentum dependent darwin interaction .",
    "finally let us compare our results to those obtained by davies @xcite , who considers the limit @xmath22 for the hamiltonian @xmath88 notice that @xmath89 is obtained through canonical quantization of ( [ clf ] ) and ( [ clp ] ) if one does not set @xmath13 as we did before .",
    "davies proves that for all @xmath90 @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the fock vacuum and @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this shows that although the limit @xmath22 is equivalent to our scaling on the classical level , the results for the quantum model differ qualitatively . while we obtain effective dynamics for states which contain a nonzero number of bosons independent of @xmath24 , cf .",
    "( [ result ] ) , the @xmath11 limit yields effective dynamics for states which contain no bosons at all .",
    "furthermore , the limit @xmath21 is a singular limit as no limiting dynamics for @xmath95 exists .    in section 3",
    "we also consider an infrared - renormalized model suggested in @xcite and @xcite , which allows us to do without the global infrared condition ( [ ircon ] ) .",
    "the results are exactly the same as in the standard nelson model .",
    "generalizing from the time - adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics @xcite , we consider perturbations of self - adjoint operators @xmath96 , which are fibered over the base space @xmath97 , where , for better readability , we use @xmath98 to denote this base space .",
    "let @xmath99 be a separable hilbert space and let @xmath100 denote lebesgue measure . recall that @xmath96 acting on @xmath101 is called fibered , cf .",
    "@xcite , if there is a measurable map @xmath102 with values in the self - adjoint operators on @xmath99 such that @xmath103 there seems to be no standard name for the set @xmath104 and we propose to call it the _ fibered spectrum _ of @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath105 be such that @xmath106 is measurable , where @xmath107 denotes the spectral projection of @xmath79 associated with @xmath108 .",
    "then @xmath109 is an orthogonal projection which commutes with @xmath96 , but which is in general not a spectral projection of @xmath96 .",
    "we consider perturbations of @xmath96 , which mix the fibers , in a sense , slowly . as a prototype",
    "consider for a sufficiently regular real valued function @xmath110 on `` momentum space '' @xmath97 the self - adjoint operator @xmath111 on @xmath112 . here",

    "but the relevant time scale for the dynamics generated by @xmath120 is @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",

    "the object of this section is to establish an analogous result without assuming a gap condition .",
