    "evidences for the existence of dark matter are mainly coming from cosmological observations related to the physics of gravity .",
    "these include the relic density of dark matter , anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large scale structure of the universe , as well as the bullet clusters and the associated gravitational lensing effects .",
    "while we still do not know what the nature of dark matter is , it is clear that there is no room to accommodate dark matter in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics based on gauge invariance of @xmath1 and einstein - hilbert gravity theory based on general coordinate invariance . while it is plausible that the nature of dark matter may have a purely gravitational origin , theories that have been put forward thus far are not as convincing as those from the particle physics point of view .",
    "in particular the relic density strongly suggests that dark matter may be a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "if dark matter can indeed be related to weak scale physics , there may be hope for us to detect them in various underground experiments of direct detection as well as in space experiments using balloons , satellites , or space station of indirect detection .",
    "furthermore , wimp dark matter might be produced directly at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) by manifesting itself as missing energy with a spectrum that may be discriminated from standard model background of neutrinos .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the simplest dark matter model @xcite which is based on adding a real singlet scalar field to the sm .",
    "the communication between the scalar dark matter and the sm gauge bosons and fermions must then go through the sm higgs boson .",
    "while there have been many studies for this simple model and its variants in the literature @xcite , we believe a global study of this model is still missing . in this work",
    ", we will fill this gap .",
    "we use the current experimental constraints of relic density from wmap @xcite , 225 live days data from direct experiment xenon100 @xcite , diffuse gamma - ray flux from indirect detection experiment of fermi - lat using the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies ( dsphs ) @xcite , and a higgs boson candidate with mass about 125 gev reported recently by the lhc @xcite to deduce the best fit parameters of the model .",
    "the deduced parameters are used to predict various phenomenology of the model at the lhc , including production of the mono-@xmath0 jet , single charged lepton , and two charged leptons plus missing energies .",
    "we also evaluate the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment which is a two loop process in the model . for a global fitting based on effective operators approach , see our recent work in @xcite .",
    "a similar global analysis for isospin violating dark matter is presented in @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we will briefly review the scalar phantom model of dark matter . in section iii",
    ", we present the global fitting for the relevant parameters of the model using the various experimental constraints described above . in section iv , we discuss collider phenomenology and the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the model .",
    "we conclude in section v. some analytical formulas of the matrix elements needed in our analysis as well as the expression for the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment are collected in the appendix .",
    "the simplest dark matter model ( sz ) @xcite ( dubbed scalar phantom by the authors in @xcite ) is obtained by adding one real singlet scalar @xmath2 in addition to the higgs doublet @xmath3 to the sm .",

    "the analysis given here is in the spirit of seeing whether or not the simplest version of this kind of model could now be ruled out .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath3 develops a vacuum expectation value @xmath10 , where @xmath11 gev . after making the shift @xmath12 , the physical higgs field @xmath13 obtains a mass @xmath14 and the last term in eq.([sz ] ) becomes @xmath15 the first term on the right handed side of eq.([shift ] ) implies the dark matter @xmath2",
    "also pick up an additional contribution of @xmath16 to its mass , thus @xmath17 .",

    "the second term in eq .",
    "( [ shift ] ) tells us that the dark matter @xmath2 can communicate to the sm fields and self - interact with itself via a tree level higgs exchange , while the last term contributes to the relic density calculation from the process @xmath19 if kinematically allowed .",
    "if kinematics permits , the second term also allows higgs boson to decay into a pair of @xmath2 , giving rise to the invisible higgs width .",
    "implication of invisible higgs width in the higgs search at the lhc will be discussed further in the following sections .",
    "there are a few theoretical restrictions on the model , including vacuum stability , unitarity , and triviality .",
    "stability of the vacuum requires the scalar potential be bounded from below . at tree level",
