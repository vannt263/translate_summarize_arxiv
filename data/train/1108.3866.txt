    "the study of ultracold polar molecules has now become a vast and exciting area of interest since the formation of bi - alkali heteronuclear polar molecules  @xcite .",
    "the molecules can be controlled at the ground electronic , vibrational , rotational  @xcite , and hyperfine  @xcite quantum - level .",
    "the external motion of the polar molecules can also be modified by an electric field  @xcite and by an optical lattice confinement  @xcite .",
    "polar molecules offer remarkable characteristics .",
    "first , they have strong electric dipole moments  @xcite",
    ". the interactions between polar molecules can then be dominated by electric dipole - dipole terms .",
    "the electric molecular interactions are strong , long - range , anisotropic and can be tuned by electric fields . secondly , the polar molecules can be either bosons or fermions .",
    "if the polar molecules are addressed in a single quantum state , they become indistinguishable and quantum statistics plays a strong role .",
    "an ultracold gas of bosonic molecules can lead to bose - einstein condensation and an ultracold sample of fermionic molecules can lead to a degenerate fermi gas .",
    "thirdly , two polar molecules can be reactive or not  @xcite .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that among the bi - alkali heteronuclear molecules in their absolute fundamental ground state , that the lithium species lina , lik , lirb , lics in addition with the krb molecule ( category 1 ) gave rise to two - body exoergic chemical reactive processes while the remaining species nak , narb , nacs , kcs , rbcs ( category 2 ) resulted in two - body endoergic processes .",
    "reactivity is an advantage to investigate the ultracold chemistry of molecules  @xcite .",
    "it also provides a clear signature ( in term of molecular loss ) of two - body interactions in a gas and depends strongly on the applied electric field  @xcite .",
    "the non - reactive molecules have the advantage of being chemically stable in their absolute ground state and can help to reach long - lived samples of polar molecules . however , if dense samples of molecules are formed in bose - einstein condensates for example , three - body collision can become a source of loss , and it is important to investigate the collisional properties of such processes  @xcite .",
    "finally , molecules offer a rich internal quantum structure and can be manipulated with electromagnetic waves in order to address their quantum state .",
    "exciting perspectives have been proposed for these polar molecules .",
    "this involves condensed matter and many - body physics , quantum magnetism , precision measurements , controlled chemistry and quantum information  @xcite .    for all these reasons ,",
    "many experimental groups are currently interested in creating polar molecules .",
    "the fermionic polar molecules @xmath2k@xmath3rb received a particular experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite consideration recently . however , much less is known about the interactions and the dynamical properties of the other polar bi - alkali molecules , for which experimental attention is also devoted  @xcite .",
    "this is what we address in this article . in section",
    "ii , we compute the isotropic long - range van der waals coefficients between polar molecules .",
    "we focus our study to the exoergic molecules ( category 1 ) . in section iii",
    ", we use these parameters to perform quantum scattering calculations assuming full loss when the polar molecules are close to each other .",
    "we consider the case of collisions in free and confined space , in electric fields .",
    "we use a quantum threshold ( qt ) model to explain how the collisional properties scale with the different species .",
    "we arrive at analytical expressions of high - loss collision rates of bosonic or fermionic molecules , which can also be applied to the inelastic and reactive case of molecules of category 2 , as well as atom - atom or atom - molecule collisions , provided the van der waals coefficients are known .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "the isotropic dispersion coefficient @xmath4 between two identical diatomic alkali - metal molecules in the @xmath5=0 and @xmath6=0 rovibrational ground state of the x@xmath7 potential has three contributions @xmath8 where the first term of the integrand is the square of the isotropic dynamic polarizability @xmath9 at imaginary frequency @xmath10 due to rovibrational transitions within the ground state potential .",
    "the second term in the integrand is the square of the isotropic polarizability @xmath11 due to transitions to the rovibrational levels of electronically excited potentials , while the last term indicates an interference between the first two contributions . in these and subsequent expressions both the dispersion coefficient and the polarizability",

    "@xcite .",
    "the isotropic dynamic polarizability @xmath11 contains contributions from transitions to the rovibrational excited @xmath7 and @xmath19 potentials , which correspond to the parallel and perpendicular component of the polarizability , respectively .",
    "based on the franck - condon principle we can evaluate the polarizability at each interatomic separation rather than perform an average over ro - vibrational levels @xcite . for @xmath5=0 and @xmath6=0",
