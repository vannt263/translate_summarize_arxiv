    "since the interfaces are ubiquitous in nature , very intensive efforts are devoted to the description of their physical properties @xcite .",
    "models where discrete unities are arranged in regular lattices constitute very useful tools due to their easy computer implementation",
    ". however , on - lattice growth models are frequently very sensitive to the intrinsic lattice anisotropy .",
    "such a dependence is evident for clusters grown from a single particle ( a seed ) as , for example , the classical diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) @xcite and eden @xcite models .",
    "consequently , the interface scaling analysis in these models is much less frequent than that for the growth from flat surfaces .",
    "however , the interface scaling in several experiments with radial symmetry has been considered along the past decade .",
    "examples include the dynamics of several types of tumors @xcite , the plant callus evolution @xcite , and grain - grain displacement in hele - shaw cells @xcite , among others . in this scenario ,",
    "the elaboration of on - lattice models without the undesirable effects of anisotropy becomes worthy .",
    "the eden model @xcite is the simplest discrete model , in which the anisotropy is determinant .",
    "its original version was studied on a square lattice where the sites can assume two values @xmath4 or @xmath5 , representing occupied or empty sites , respectively .",
    "the simulations start with a single particle at the center of the lattice and the growth rules are the following : at each step a peripheral site ( an occupied site with at least one empty nearest - neighbor ) is chosen at random and one of its empty nearest - neighbors is selected with equal probability and then occupied . variants of the eden rules were studied , and the original version is commonly called eden b @xcite .    despite its simplicity",
    ", the eden model produces clusters with nontrivial interface scaling usually analyzed through the interface width , also called roughness .",
    "the roughness is defined as the root mean square deviation of the interface around its mean value @xmath6^{1/2 } , \\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] where a set of @xmath7 distances @xmath8 represents the interface and @xmath9 is the corresponding mean value .",
    "the usual behavior of the roughness is a power law growth with the time @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the growth exponent .",
    "intensive numerical simulations of the eden model grown from flat substrates provide the growth exponent @xmath12 @xcite , which corresponds to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class @xcite .",
    "however , the roughness of on - lattice eden aggregates grown from a seed is ruled by the lattice anisotropy @xcite and characterized by an asymptotic growth exponent @xmath13 .",
    "zabolitzky and stauffer @xcite simulated clusters with @xmath14 particles of the square lattice eden a model and observed that the interface width evolves in non - trivial way . in this version , the growth sites ( empty sites with at least one occupied nearest - neighbor ) are chosen at random and then occupied .",
    "for small clusters , a good agreement with kpz growth exponent ( @xmath15 ) was observed , in contrast with the linear dependence on time ( @xmath16 ) obtained for asymptotically large clusters .",
    "the value @xmath13 is associate to the cluster diamond - like shape caused by the square lattice anisotropy @xcite .",
    "off - lattice eden model was simulated by wang _",
    "@xcite , and the exponent @xmath17 , a value significantly larger than the kpz one , was found .",
    "recently , ferreira and alves @xcite showed that the exponent reported by wang _",
    "is due to the fluctuations of the border center of mass used as the origin for the roughness evaluation .",
    "actually , the kpz exponent is obtained when an origin fixed on the initial seed is used .    in the present work",
    ", we analyzed large eden clusters ( @xmath18 particles ) using a procedure developed in order to remove the anisotropy of dla clusters @xcite .",
    "our central aim is to propose a strategy for the growth of isotropic on - lattice eden clusters without change their universality class , as well as to corroborate recent finds about the scaling of off - lattice eden clusters .",
    "the paper outline is the following . in section [ model ] , the growth rules are presented and the results for dla model summarized .",
    "the simulation results are presented and discussed in section [ results ] , while some conclusions are drawn in section [ conclu ] .",
    "the growth of isotropic on - lattice dla clusters was considered by bogoyavlenskiy @xcite . in this rule , an empty site is chosen to be grown following the standard dla model , but the growth is implemented , or not , with probability @xmath19 given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of occupied nearest - neighbors of the growth site . although the preliminary simulations done by bogoyavlenskiy suggested that the procedure was successful , alves and ferreira @xcite verified that it produces patterns with diagonal anisotropy at the large scale simulation or the high noise reduction limits . the noise reduction is a tool used to enhance the cluster anisotropy and consists of a set of counters at each growth site that are increased by a unit every time these sites are selected for the growth .",
    "an empty site is occupied only after its selection for @xmath22 times . also , alves and ferreira @xcite proposed a generalized algorithm with growth probabilities given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lattice coordination number and @xmath25 an adjustable parameter .",
    "it was found that a suitable choice of @xmath25 strongly reduces the cluster anisotropy .",
    "indeed , the dla patterns exhibit axial and diagonal anisotropies when @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , and an eight - fold structure was observed for @xmath28 . in the generalized eden model ,",
    "an empty site is chosen to be grown using one of the eden model versions and the growth is implemented , or not , following eq .",
    "( [ eq : pnu ] ) .",
    "in this section , the square lattice case with lattice coordination @xmath29 is considered .",
    "figure [ fig : m1 ] shows the borders of large eden b clusters ( linear size @xmath30 ) generated without noise reduction ( @xmath31 ) in order to illustrate the deviations from the circular shape . for sake of comparison ,",
    "circles of diameter @xmath32 centered at the seed were drawn ( dashed line ) .",
    "it is evident from this figure that the border is axially or diagonally stretched for small and large @xmath25 values , respectively , whereas an approximately symmetric shape is observed when @xmath33 .",
    "this @xmath34 value differs from the value @xmath35 found for the noiseless limit as observed for the dla model @xcite where the crossover occurs at @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the noiseless and @xmath31 cases , respectively .",
    "+    two central points should be elucidated .",
    "the first one concerns the quantitative estimate for @xmath34 , and the second one is the inquiry if the model belongs to the kpz universality class for @xmath28 . in order to analyze these points , we determined the interface width evolution considering the center of the lattice as the origin .",
    "since the model dynamics is restricted to the border , we can do an analogy with the growth from flat substrates @xcite and take the time proportional to the number of peripheral particles or , equivalently , to the mean radius @xmath9 .",
    "we used square lattices containing @xmath38 sites and grew clusters with more than @xmath39 particles .",
    "we concentrate our analyzes on the eden b model because its convergence to the asymptotic scaling is faster than that of the eden a model @xcite . for the last one ,",
    "@xmath40 particles were necessary to enhance the diamond - like scaling ( @xmath0 ) @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : wedenc](a ) , the interface width is plotted as a function of the mean radius for @xmath25 varying around @xmath41 .",
    "as one can see , the double - logarithm curves exhibit upward curvatures for both @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( inset ) while a power law is observed for @xmath44 .",
    "also , the slopes are very close to the kpz growth exponent @xmath12 when @xmath44 .    in order to find the null curvature point , which represents the absence of anisotropy ,",
    "the double - logarithm data are fitted by cubic polynomials @xmath45 and the mean curvature is defined by @xmath46 where @xmath8 and @xmath47 are",
    "the lower and upper cutoffs of the data used in the cubic fits , respectively , and @xmath48 is the local curvature defined by @xmath49^{3/2}}.\\ ] ] the transient behavior for very small clusters was avoided using fit ranges from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "the mean curvature as a function of @xmath25 is plotted in figure [ fig : wedenc](b ) .",
    "this figure suggests a abrupt variation around the minimum of @xmath52 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath52 occurs between @xmath53 and @xmath54 providing the estimates @xmath55 and * @xmath56*. here , the fits were done for @xmath57 and the uncertainty represents the local slope fluctuations along the distinct parts of the curves .",
    "this growth exponent is in very good agreement with the kpz universality class expected for the original eden model .",
    "finally , these data strongly indicate that the curvature vanishes as a power law as @xmath58 .    a central feature related to the interface scaling of round clusters",
    "is the choice of the origin , as recently demonstrated for the off - lattice eden model @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if the width is evaluated in relation to the border center of mass ( cm ) , the growth exponent is @xmath59 @xcite , which differs from the kpz exponent observed when the initial seed is used ( a fixed origin ) .",
    "this difference was associated to the cm fluctuations growing faster than the interface ones .",
    "we applied this analysis to the present model with @xmath28 in order to assess the agreement with the scaling exponents obtained for the off - lattice model and to extend the off - lattice simulations limited to @xmath60 particles to more than @xmath39 particles .",
    "the results are show in figure [ fig : wcm ] , where the interface width evaluated in relation to the cm ( @xmath61 ) is compared with that in relation to the seed ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "it is evident that the corresponding growth exponents are distinct .",
    "indeed , the exponents are @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with the off - lattice eden model @xcite , reinforcing the equivalence between the universality classes of the models .",
    "the cm mean distance from the seed exhibits two power law regimes , namely @xmath65 and @xmath66 for small and large system sizes , respectively .",
    "again , the asymptotic scaling agrees with the off - lattice simulations .",
    "the most used version of the eden model is that known as eden a @xcite . in this version",
    "a growth site ( an empty site neighboring an occupied one ) is chosen at random and then occupied . in the noiseless limit",
    ", the transition from axial to diagonal anisotropy is the same observed for the eden b model , including the interface width minimum occurring at @xmath67 . without noise reduction ,",
    "the criteria of null curvature gives @xmath68 and growth exponents in very good agreement with the off - lattice eden model .",
    "the lower precision of the parameter @xmath34 , in comparison with the eden b version , is due to the slower convergence to the asymptotic exponents and the larger @xmath34 value .",
    "the last implies in a higher frequency of rejected tentatives along the simulations .",
    "+    the difference between the @xmath34 values for eden a and b models can be understood analyzing the growth site neighborhood at @xmath69 .",
    "lets @xmath70 be the fraction of growth sites with @xmath21 occupied neighbors .",
    "considering the square lattice anisotropy , one can easily conclude that the growth sites with @xmath71 and @xmath72 produce axial growth , those with @xmath73 produce diagonal growth , while those with @xmath74 produce an inward growth which does not contribute for the overall anisotropy .",
    "one can suppose that if the axial growth probability exceeds the axial one , the anisotropy rotation emerges .",
    "so , we analyzed the difference between them using the relation @xmath75 figure [ fig : delta ] shows the curves @xmath76 against @xmath25 .",
    "as one can see , the @xmath77 values for which the diagonal and axial growth probabilities are equal ( @xmath78 ) are slightly larger than @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , we found @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the eden a and b , respectively .",
    "notice that these differences are small , but neatly distinguishable since the respective deviations from null curvature are evident as shown in figure [ fig : wedenc](b ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the isotropic growth of eden clusters can not be explained only by the counterbalance between diagonal and axial growths .",
    "in this work , we developed a strategy to grow on - lattice eden clusters without the undesirable anisotropy effects .",
    "asymptotically large clusters generated with the original eden model are ruled by a diamond - like and , consequently , a growth exponent @xmath13 , in disagreement with the kpz universality class ( @xmath12 ) observed for the growth from a flat substrate .",
    "we proposed an extended eden model , in which the growth probability is proportional to a power of the number of occupied nearest neighbors , @xmath81 , in analogy with a procedure developed to remove the anisotropy of dla clusters @xcite .",
    "we found that the choices @xmath82 and @xmath83 lead to isotropic patterns for the eden a and b models , respectively , preserving the kpz universality class .",
    "also , the extended model agrees with off - lattice simulations , in which the center of mass fluctuations are considered @xcite .",
    "the present strategy constitutes a useful tool for modeling experiments with radial symmetry since lattice models can be easily generalized .",
    "a very important example is the recent report concerning the dynamics of tumors @xcite .",
    "these experiments indicate a universal dynamics characterized by the mullins - herring universality class @xcite for distinct types of tumors . however , this idea is subject of recent controversies @xcite ."
