    "the way in which veronese spaces were presented in those papers , where the points are two - element sets with repetitions with the elements being projective points , turned out to be fruitfully generalizable to an abstract construction , which associates with an arbitrary partial linear space ( or even more generally : with an arbitrary incidence structure ) another partial linear space ( incidence structure resp . ) ; this construction and its basic properties were presented in @xcite .",

    "we develop to some extent the theory of veronese spaces associated with spaces with some additional structures ( like a parallelism ) , we discuss possibilities to introduce parallelism in the veronese spaces and related questions , all in a sense referring to a broad problem :  hyperplanes and parallelisms \" .",
    "the main approach is determining a hyperplane in a veronese space associated with a linear space that contains hyperplanes ( say : with a projective space ) and delete this hyperplane .",
    "the obtained reduct can not be presented as a veronese space ( [ thm : verprodnotverred ] ) .",
    "nevertheless we could succeed in characterizing the hyperplanes in ( ` classical ' ) veronese spaces associated with projective spaces ( [ thm : hipainprojver ] ) and prove that ( similarly to the case when a hyperplane is deleted from a projective space ) from the obtained  the underlying veronese space can be recovered ( [ thm : verred2ver ] ) .",

    "{ l\\in\\lines\\colon l\\parallel l_0 \\}$ ] of a line @xmath253 has the size @xmath516 .",
    "then the following must be satisfied @xmath517 the equation is so called fundamental equation of the theory of s , and is obtained when we observe that a direction must cover the point set of @xmath405 . recall that the so called gaussian coefficient @xmath518 gives the number of the @xmath72-dimensional subspaces of the @xmath519-dimensional vector space over @xmath520 . if @xmath521 is the @xmath519-dimensional affine space over @xmath520 then @xmath522 , @xmath523 , @xmath524 , @xmath525 , and @xmath526 . if @xmath67 is a partial linear space on @xmath527 points and @xmath528 lines with the corresponding point and line ranks @xmath529 and @xmath530 , then the parameters of @xmath68 are as follows : @xmath531 , @xmath532 , @xmath533 , and @xmath534 .    [ thm : noparinver ]",
    "let @xmath535 .",
    "there is no finite  @xmath372 with fixed size of directions of its lines such that @xmath500 admits a parallelism , the directions of lines of @xmath405 have a constant size , and each leaf of @xmath405 is an _ affine subspace _ of @xmath405 ( i.e.  its each of its leaves is closed under this parallelism ) .",
    "suppose , to the contrary , that there are such @xmath405 and @xmath372 ; let @xmath519 be the number of points of @xmath372 .",
    "denote by @xmath536 and @xmath516 the corresponding sizes of directions .",
    "let @xmath427 be the line size of @xmath372 , and thus of @xmath405 as well .",
    "when we observe that a direction must cover the point set of @xmath405 we get      since no two leaves of @xmath405 have a line in common , a direction of @xmath405 is a union of directions considered in each of the leaves , and each of these leaves is isomorphic to @xmath372 .",
    "this gives us the relation @xmath539 , which yields @xmath540 , so @xmath541 .",
    "in particular , [ thm : noparinver ] yields a rather strange result : the structure @xmath542 can be covered by a family of subspaces each one isomorphic to the affine space @xmath543 and therefore a natural parallelism intrinsically definable exists in each of the covering subspaces :    [ rem : parincov ] let @xmath372 be an affine space and let @xmath113 be lines of @xmath544",
    ". then @xmath545 iff there are lines @xmath546 parallel in @xmath372 such that and @xmath547 for some @xmath44 and @xmath548 .",
    "the proof of [ rem : parincov ] is immediate after and [ fct : beztroj ] .",
    "the union of the parallelisms in leaves is a partial parallelism and there is no ` global ' parallelism , that agree in a natural way with the parallelisms on leaves , definable on the whole line set of @xmath542 .",
    "note , however , some limitations .",
    "namely , with the techniques of the proof of [ thm : noparinver ] one can compute that if parallelisms required exist with constant sizes of the directions then ( notation as above )      when @xmath372 is a resolvable steiner triple system from the kirkman criterion , and directly when @xmath372 is a finite affine space @xmath543 , @xmath179 odd , we deduce that @xmath519 is even and then @xmath552 is an integer .",
    "the equation together with [ rem : vero : apls ] gives us a technique to define parallelisms on the lines of @xmath553 : it suffices to divide each of the equivalence classes of the relation @xmath334 defined by into @xmath1 disjoint sets such that every element of this decomposition is a covering of the point set of the considered veronese space .",
    "do there always exist such a decomposition of a direction as required above .",
    "suppose @xmath554 is a direction in @xmath369 .",
    "then the corresponding equivalence class of @xmath334 is the set @xmath555 how to divide this set  in a natural way \" in a particular case @xmath82 the above assumes form @xmath556 possibly in this case a solution is easier      is it possible to define @xmath0 in terms of @xmath154 ? when the grassmannian in question is further restricted to a complement of a hyperplane , the answer seems positive , as the missing points are exactly the directions , but without a parallelism , it may be hard !",
    "what properties should , generally , a function @xmath227 given by meet so as @xmath183 defined by is a subspace and , consequently , it is a hyperplane ? in a less general settings , it suffices to find what general properties of a function @xmath227 assure that with the above definitions adopted we get @xmath557 for each @xmath558 .",
    "clearly , the latter condition yields that @xmath183 is a subspace .",
    "the claim of [ thm : verred2ver ] seems valid also for veronese spaces associated with projective spaces , where a quasi - correlation @xmath218 is degenerate , since @xmath559 .",
    "does [ thm : verred2ver ] remain true when @xmath218 is degenerate and @xmath560 ?",
    "the claim of [ thm : verred2ver ] seems valid also when @xmath559 . in that case",
    "the proof of [ lem : hipa2 - 2lines ] can be modified so as it works in case when @xmath561 for a point @xmath562 . however ,",
    "when @xmath72 is a line of @xmath222 contained in @xmath183 then no line @xmath563 of @xmath289 can be completed to a net outside @xmath183 ( cf .",
    "[ lem : vernet2 ] ) and to prove an analogue of [ lem : hipa2 - 2lines ] one must find some other methods . on the other hand , when @xmath564 then each line of @xmath2 through @xmath109 is contained in @xmath183 and thus @xmath183 is not , so new difficulties arise and no end in sight .      indeed ,",
    "if @xmath565 then the point set of @xmath272 and of @xmath566 ( we write @xmath567 ) coincide .",
    "the set @xmath183 determined by @xmath218 is a hyperplane both in @xmath272 and in @xmath566 so , consequently , @xmath568 and @xmath569 have exactly the same points .",
    "the distinction concerns lines only .",
    "note that each pair of points @xmath570 , @xmath571 collinear in @xmath272 can be completed by a unique point @xmath572 ( @xmath573 ) to a triangle not contained in any leaf .",
    "then a line @xmath165 of @xmath272 not contained in @xmath183 yields a line of @xmath566 iff @xmath574 for each distinct @xmath575 on @xmath165 ( equivalently , though surprisingly from the point of view of geometry : ` for some distinct @xmath575 ' ) .",
    "this observation may be considered as a starting information in the search of characterization in question .",
    "first : does the claim of [ lema : symplect2hipa ] follow ( how ) for arbitrary @xmath218 ?",
    "second : can analogous / similar construction be provided for @xmath406 it seems possible that @xmath1-linear forms may yield examples of hyperplanes in @xmath579 .        9 , _",
