    "impurity ions present in tokamak plasmas can significantly degrade plasma performance through radiative losses and fuel dilution @xcite .",
    "conversely , impurity ions present in the edge or near the divertor of a tokamak may be beneficial by radiating thermal energy and thereby mitigating the heat load incident on the divertor and plasma facing components @xcite .",
    "an understanding of impurity transport ( a topic which has received less attention than the transport of bulk ions ) is crucial in order to predict the overall performance of fusion plasmas @xcite .",
    "the analysis of charged particle motion in strongly - magnetized plasmas , for example those in tokamaks , generally relies heavily on a multi - timescale approach @xcite , whereby the particle motion is decomposed into fast gyromotion about the magnetic field , streaming motion along the field ( characterised by adiabatic invariance of the particle magnetic moment ) and a much slower drift motion of the particle guiding centre across the field .",
    "this treatment is valid provided that the drift ordering is satisfied .",
    "specifically , the particle larmor radius must be small compared to the length scales on which the electric , * e * , and magnetic , * b * , fields vary , the cyclotron period must be short compared to the field variation time scales and the @xmath0 drift velocity must be small compared to the particle thermal speed .    in spherical tokamaks ( sts ) , such as the mega ampre spherical tokamak ( mast ) @xcite , the drift ordering is often not applicable , and it is then not possible to treat particle motion analytically . on the low field side of a st plasma",
    "the poloidal component of the magnetic field can be comparable to the toroidal component , so that the drift orbit width of a trapped particle can be of the same order as the particle larmor radius .",
    "moreover , in st plasmas with edge transport barriers ( etbs ) the associated radial electric field can vary on length scales comparable to both the drift orbit width and the larmor radius of thermal ions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that both collisionless trapped particle guiding centre orbits and particle gyro - motion are significantly distorted by strongly - sheared radial electric fields @xcite .",
    "this effect is often referred to as _ orbit squeezing _",
    "@xcite , although in fact the widths of trapped particle orbits can be either reduced or increased , depending on the sign of the electric field gradient .",
    "the effects of orbit squeezing on neoclassical bulk ion transport have previously been studied in the limit of large aspect ratio @xcite using this framework .",
    "however , the analytical theory of orbit squeezing assumes linearly sheared electric fields , and recent measurements of radial electric fields associated with etbs in spherical tokamaks indicate field profiles that are not consistent with the assumption of constant shear @xcite .",
    "this highlights one limitation of the current theory and motivates the use of a numerical approach .",
    "we note that non - uniformly sheared electric fields have previously been investigated using a full orbit approach @xcite . however , this study investigated the impact of shear on particle @xmath0 flow and only considered collisionless particle orbits . in the present work",
    "we investigate the impact on the motion and collisional transport of impurities of a strongly - sheared electric field in a mast - like spherical tokamak equilibrium using a full orbit , test - particle simulation code .",
    "the fields are assumed to be axisymmetric and static ; we therefore neglect turbulent transport effects .",
    "the transport of impurities in a spherical tokamak with a prescribed local radial electric field is simulated using the test particle code cuebit @xcite , which solves the lorentz - langevin equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and * v * are the impurity mass , charge and velocity , respectively .",
    "the term on the right - hand side of that is proportional to @xmath4 models the friction from the bulk ions . in the absence of an electric field",
    "it ensures that the impurities relax to a drifting maxwellian distribution temperature @xmath5 and flow * u * matching those of the bulk ions . here ,",
    "* u * is taken to be zero ; we assume that the radial lorentz force is sub - dominant to the pressure gradient term in the radial component of the bulk ion fluid momentum balance equation .",
    "this assumption is consistent with reported measurements of temperatures , densities and flows in the vicinity of etbs in mast @xcite : the pressure gradient is typically several tens of kpam@xmath6 whereas the contributions of poloidal and toroidal flows to the radial component of the lorentz force are typically around one or two kpam@xmath6 at most . in taking * u",
    "* to be zero we also neglect any deviation of the bulk ion distribution from a stationary maxwellian arising from neoclassical effects @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is the classical impurity - bulk ion collision time given by @xcite @xmath8 which is a function of the local bulk ion temperature and density profiles , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath11 is the coulomb logarithm and @xmath12 is the permittivity of free space .    the final term on the right - hand side of models random accelerations of impurities due to coulomb collisions with bulk ions .",
    "the vector @xmath13 is a set of three random numbers , chosen independently for each particle at each time step from a gaussian distribution of zero mean and variance @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the time step that is used in the numerical simulation .",
    "although the instantaneous collisions are taken to be isotropic , the cumulative effect of these over an impurity larmor orbit naturally reflects the effects of gradients in the bulk ion temperature and density profiles ( leading to , for example , thermal forces ) , which leads to anisotropy in the collisions .",
    "here we have again assumed that the bulk ions have a maxwellian distribution .",
    "furthermore , in simulating test particles we assume that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the impurity ion charge number , @xmath18 is the impurity ion number density , @xmath19 is the bulk ion number density and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the electron and bulk ion masses respectively @xcite .",
    "this condition essentially ensures that collisions of bulk ions with impurity ions are sufficiently infrequent that they have a negligible effect on the bulk plasma neoclassical transport and automatically ensures that collisions between impurity ions can be neglected .",
    "a mast - like equilibrium is considered , which is modelled using an analytical solovev - type solution of the grad - shafranov equation with a linear pressure profile and a potential toroidal magnetic field component . in cylindrical coordinates ( r,@xmath22,z ) , the poloidal flux , @xmath23 , is of the form @xmath24 + \\frac{1-\\gamma}{2}r^2 z^2 \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 corresponding to a total plasma current of 1 ma .",
    "the magnetic field vector is calculated from as @xmath29=@xmath30+@xmath31 where @xmath32= 0.386 tm .",
    "we assume @xmath33 and @xmath34 are flux functions and prescribe analytical forms , @xmath35 where @xmath36 the flux at the magnetic axis and @xmath37 kev , @xmath38 kev , @xmath39 m@xmath40 and @xmath41 m@xmath40 .",
    "these profiles are broadly consistent with those measured in co - rotating mast h - mode plasma discharges @xcite . in such discharges , the effective ion charge is often measured to be close to unity throughout the core plasma , indicating no significant impurity accumulation .",
    "a local radially sheared electric field @xmath42 near the edge is included , with an associated electrostatic potential @xmath43 of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the potential barrier height , location in @xmath23 space and width in @xmath23 space , respectively .",
    "measurements reported by meyer @xcite of edge radial electric fields in mast h - mode plasmas ( see for example , figure 7 of @xcite ) show that the corresponding potential profile is approximately of the form given by and that these constants have typical values of @xmath45=60 v and @xmath47=1.35 10@xmath40 tm@xmath48 .",
    "we choose , for computational ease , to centre the electric field structure on @xmath46=0.6@xmath49=-0.4 tm@xmath48 . for our particular choice of equilibrium",
    ", these quantities correspond to a physical location and width in the outboard @xmath17=0 plane of @xmath50=1.2 m and @xmath51=1.1 cm .",
    "the corresponding peak electric field strength , @xmath52 , is @xmath53 kvm@xmath6 , which is close to measured values in mast etbs @xcite .",
    "we shall present results from simulations with varying values of @xmath45 and @xmath47 within the ranges @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the form of this prescribed electric field is shown in , which illustrates a limitation of using the orbit squeezing model : namely , which value of the squeeze factor to use when characterising the impact of the electric field on particle motion .",
    "in addition to a radial electric field , the inward ware pinch @xcite is modelled approximately with a constant toroidal electric field @xmath56 . including the @xmath57 dependence of this field has a small , @xmath58 , effect on measured diffusion coefficients .",
    "in the absence of an electric field we expect neoclassical particle transport to be purely diffusive @xcite . for tokamak plasmas with slowly - varying profiles , transport coefficients",
    "may be deduced empirically from moments of the spatial distribution of test particles @xcite . ,",
    "in which the evolution of the mean minor radius of the impurity distribution is plotted , illustrates a typical cuebit simulation in which @xmath59 c@xmath60 ions are initially released from the magnetic axis in the absence of any electric field .",
    "overlaid is a @xmath61 fit expected from diffusive transport @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a diffusion coefficient of @xmath62 , which is close to the expected pfirsch - schlter neoclassical diffusivity in the plasma core , @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath64 is the safety factor and @xmath65 is the larmor radius .    in the case of narrow transport barriers , with plasma properties varying on length scales down to the larmor radius ,",
    "it is not possible to infer local transport coefficients using this method . in such cases a local effective diffusivity @xmath66",
    "may be deduced directly from the local radial particle flux @xmath67 and density gradient @xmath68 : @xmath69 here @xmath18 is the flux surface - averaged minority ion density and @xmath70 is a radial coordinate , defined as the flux surface averaged minor radial coordinate @xmath71 with @xmath72 the arc length along a flux surface in the r  z plane .",
    "@xmath73 is evaluated numerically as a function of @xmath23 for the solovev equilibrium described above . to quantify the impact of sheared electric fields on particle transport the value of @xmath66 is normalised to its value measured in the absence of any electric field , @xmath74 .",
    "clearly @xmath66 is a simplified formulation of the particle diffusion coefficient since we assume that particle flux scales linearly with the minority ion density gradient .",
    "however , we wish to emphasise that @xmath75 , which appears in , is the full particle flux as computed by cuebit .",
    "this includes the effects of transport driven by bulk ion gradients , e.g. the thermal force arising from the bulk ion temperature gradient ( see , for example , equation 5.9 of @xcite ) .",
    "such a force arises from the variation of the collision frequency across a larmor orbit and , unlike to guiding centre and fluid calculations , appears naturally in full orbit particle simulations .    in order to elucidate the impact of radially sheared electric fields on particle transport we use . in order to proceed",
    "analytically we neglect both the random langevin term and the bulk ion flow velocity , whose contribution to the momentum balance equation can , as noted previously , be assumed to be sub - dominant to the bulk ion pressure gradient term .",
    "the combined effect of the electric field and collisional drag terms can be seen by adopting cartesian coordinates , with @xmath76 and @xmath77 both assumed to be constant , where we use the @xmath78-direction as a proxy for the radial direction in tokamak geometry .",
    "can then be solved exactly , yielding @xmath79 in tokamaks we have that @xmath80 . in this limit",
    ", we are left with the usual @xmath81 drift in the @xmath82-direction and an additional  drag force \" drift in the @xmath78-direction , which arises from the inclusion of a collisional drag in the test particle equation of motion .",
    "this implies an inward - pinch in the presence of a negative radial electric field . substituting for the impurity - ion collision frequency , given by , we find that the drag force drift can be written as @xmath83 this is independent of test particle mass but proportional to test particle charge .    in order to relate the impact of a collisional drag force drift on particle transport we consider the steady - state one - dimensional transport equation @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the peak value of the drag drift , @xmath86 .",
    "here we have assumed a form of the spatial variation of @xmath87 that is consistent with the electrostatic potential given in , with @xmath78 the displacement from the peak electric field ( @xmath88 ) and @xmath89 a measure of the electric barrier width ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "we neglect all spatial variations in @xmath86 except for that occurring due to its dependence on @xmath87 .",
    "we also assume that the impurity ion larmor radii are small compared to @xmath89 and that particle drifts in the @xmath78-direction are due solely to the drag effect .",
    "the above form of the transport equation ensures that the test particle flux , which we assume is composed of the usual diffusive and advective terms , @xmath91 is constant .",
    "introducing a dimensionless spatial variable @xmath92 and a pclet number @xmath93 , becomes @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "this has the exact solution @xmath96\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the particle density at @xmath98 , i.e. at the position of peak electric field and drag drift . for @xmath99 , or @xmath100 ,",
    "this reduces to @xmath101.\\ ] ] it follows that , at @xmath98 , we have @xmath102 identifying @xmath85 with the drag force drift velocity , and assuming that @xmath103 is essentially constant between simulations , we therefore find that the local effective particle diffusion coefficient scales with test particle charge as @xmath104 where @xmath105 and is independent of both the test particle mass and charge . despite the approximations used to derive , we will show in the next section that it provides a fairly accurate description of impurity ion transport at an etb in full toroidal geometry .",
    "we now present simulation results for a number of impurity species . in we list , for reference , the normalised collision frequency , @xmath106 of each species at the position of the simulated transport barrier . here",

    "shows the variation with electric field width and height of the effective diffusion coefficient for c@xmath60 ions .",
    "the normalised effective diffusivity has a power law scaling with electric barrier width for constant barrier height .",
    "the coefficients of the fit themselves scale linearly with barrier height .",
    "thus the scaling of diffusion coefficient with electric field width and strength may be expressed in the form @xmath149^{e / e_0 } \\mbox { m$^2$s$^{-1}$ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath150 is the fwhm of the electric field in the outer midplane and @xmath151 is the peak height of the radial electric field barrier .",
    "we see that the diffusion coefficient scales as the width of the electric field barrier to a power of the electric field strength , with the width of the barrier normalised to a fraction of the bulk ion larmor radius .",
    "this scaling has been verified for @xmath150 and @xmath151 in the ranges @xmath152 and @xmath153 kvm@xmath154 kvm@xmath6 for all impurity species , with @xmath155 the bulk ion larmor radius . in the limit of no electric field , this scaling recovers the effective diffusivity as found in simulations without an electric field barrier .",
    "the scaling parameters for various species are listed in .",
    "unlike , the empirical expression for @xmath66 given by does in fact depend on the barrier width , implying limits in the validity of the approximations used to derive the former .",
    "we expect that for large @xmath156 , the effective diffusion coefficient will no longer have a power law scaling but will tend asymptotically to a result similar to .",
    "we note , from , that @xmath157 and @xmath158 are broadly constant .",
    "therefore , the dependency of impurity transport on the shape of the electric field barrier depends approximately only on the charge state of the species , not on the species mass .",

    "we have simulated realistic radial electric field profiles for etbs in a spherical tokamak equilibrium and investigated the impact on collisional impurity transport of the strength and width of the electric field profile for a variety of impurity species .",
    "we have demonstrated that full orbit simulations provide a valuable insight into the transport of particles in such scenarios .",
    "it has been shown that a strongly - sheared radial electric field can significantly increase the confinement of test particle ions .",
    "this effect has been explained in terms of a drift arising from the drag between impurity and bulk ions , with the direction of the drift given by the radial electric field and its strength determined by the impurity charge . clearly , the negative implication of this study is the enhanced confinement of highly ionized impurity species in the vicinity of strong , negative radial electric fields .",
    "in our derivation of the drag force drift given by we neglected both spatial variations in the radial electric field and toroidal geometry .",
    "however , the scaling of effective diffusivity with @xmath17 inferred from using this drift velocity in a simple slab model of the transport barrier , , is in agreement with our test - particle simulations in which no approximations are made with regard to finite larmor radius or toroidal effects .",
    "this suggests that test - particle transport in the immediate vicinity of the barrier is not strongly - dependent on the effects of toroidal geometry or the collisionality regime ( i.e. the value of @xmath108 ) .",
    "this further indicates that finite larmor radius effects are relatively unimportant .",
    "one would expect electric field shear on length scales approaching the particle larmor radius to result in a modified drag force drift velocity , analogous to the @xmath0 drift with finite larmor radius correction discussed by tao @xcite .",
    "however , this requires further study .",
    "the location of the electric field in the simulations , which resembles more an internal transport barrier than an etb , was chosen in order to lower computation time by reducing the distance from the plasma core to the location of the electric field , thereby reducing the time before particles begin interacting with the electric field .",
    "this also has the benefit of improving particle statistics , since the particles are less dispersed radially and the number of particles at the barrier is consequently higher .",
    "simulations in which the electric barrier is located closer to the plasma edge , listed in , demonstrate that moving the barrier closer to the edge has little qualitative impact on the results obtained .",
    "furthermore , the variation of collisionality of impurity species , with normalised collisionality ranging from @xmath173 ( banana regime ) to @xmath174 ( pfirsch - schlter regime ) , appears to be unimportant , since the measured normalised diffusivity remains independent of mass and scales as expected from the drag force drift argument with particle charge .    whilst the effect of bulk plasma rotation was neglected in the present study",
    ", one would expect transport barriers to be associated with flows of the bulk ions ( e.g. zonal flows ) .",
    "for impurity ions in particular inertial effects will become important in rotating plasmas .",
    "as recently shown @xcite , strong toroidal rotation can cause heavy , incompletely - ionised impurities such as w@xmath145 to undergo very rapid collisional transport ( due to the combined effect of trapping in a centrifugal potential well and a modification to the effective magnetic field arising from the coriolis force ) .",
    "one would therefore expect a competition between this enhanced transport due to rotation and the improved confinement resulting from sheared radial electric fields .",
    "we note that the effect of improved confinement due to a sheared radial electric field is more important for spherical tokamak plasmas than for conventional tokamaks , primarily due to the strong @xmath175 dependence in .",
    "for example , in the mast - like equilibrium used throughout , we have that the ware pinch velocity is of the order @xmath176 and the drag force drift velocity is of the order @xmath177 ms@xmath6 for c@xmath60 ( where we have used @xmath178 t , @xmath179 kvm@xmath6 , @xmath180 vm@xmath6 , @xmath181 m@xmath40 , @xmath182 ev , @xmath183 and @xmath184 ) .",
    "typical values for a large conventional tokamak such as jet , on the other hand , are @xmath185 ms@xmath6 and @xmath186 ms@xmath6 ( assuming @xmath187 t , @xmath188kvm@xmath6 , @xmath189 vm@xmath6 , @xmath181 m@xmath40 , @xmath190 kev , @xmath183 and @xmath191 @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the drag force drift is much less significant than the ware pinch under typical conventional tokamak conditions .",
    "an area of possible future investigation is the impact of fluctuating radial electric fields on collisional particle transport , with the fluctuations resulting from , for example , geodesic acoustic mode ( gam ) oscillations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in recent fluid simulations of the compass - d tokamak , it has been observed that the h - mode radial electric field close to the plasma edge changes from being negative between edge localised modes ( elms ) to positive during an elm @xcite . in the context of the present work one would expect the direction of the drag force drift to switch between",
    "inward and outward directed , which could have important implications for impurity accumulation and the transport of particles at transport barriers .",
    "the flexibility of the full orbit approach means that turbulent electric or magnetic fields could be readily incorporated into numerical studies of impurity transport in elmy h - mode plasmas .",

    "<S> the collisional dynamics of test impurity ions in spherical tokamak plasmas with strongly - sheared radial electric fields is investigated by means of a test particle full orbit simulation code . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the shear is such that the standard drift ordering can no longer be assumed and a full orbit approach is required . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of radial electric field shear on neoclassical particle transport is quantified for a range of test particle mass and charge numbers and electric field parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the effect of a sheared electric field is to enhance the confinement of impurity species above the level observed in the absence of such a field . </S>",
    "<S> the effect may be explained in terms of a collisional drag force drift , which is proportional to particle charge number but independent of particle mass . </S>",
    "<S> this drift acts inwards for negative radial electric fields and outwards for positive fields , implying strongly enhanced confinement of highly ionized impurity ions in the presence of a negative radial electric field . </S>"
