    "in a generalized sense , there are three distinct types of young star clusters : ( @xmath1 ) high - mass star - forming regions with an associated extensive network of low - mass stars ( e.g. , orion ) ; ( @xmath2 ) quiescent environments that host low - mass star formation exclusively ( e.g. , taurus - auriga ) ; and ( @xmath3 ) smaller clusters of low - mass stars surrounding one or a few a / b stars .",
    "naturally , there is a continuum of such types , and the picture is not quite so simple .",
    "however , an important goal in this line of research is to generally understand the differences and commonalities between these cluster types in an effort to better explain the various clustered modes of star formation and their consequences .",
    "the lkh@xmath0 101 cluster is an interesting example of the ( @xmath3 ) type ; a handful of b stars and a hundred or more low - mass stars with a dominant source ( lkh@xmath0 101 ) at the center .",
    "the remarkable central source and apparent young age for the cluster indicate that we have been afforded a fortuitous opportunity to investigate this formation mode at a very early time . in this chapter , we highlight various studies of the lkh@xmath0 101 region , separated into sections focused on the local interstellar medium ( sect .  2 ) , distance estimates ( sect .",
    "3 ) , the embedded young cluster ( sect .  4 ) , and lkh@xmath0 101 itself ( sect .  5 ) .",
    "we conclude with a brief preview of a new , comprehensive multiwavelength study of the region , and summarize the information with an eye toward future studies ( sect .",

    "the image is roughly 7 arcminutes on a side , with north up and east to the left.,height=451 ]",
    "lkh@xmath0 101 is located just north of the taurus - auriga complex ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 [ j2000 ] ; @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) in the l1482 dark cloud .",
    "as figure 1 demonstrates , the examination of an optical image near lkh@xmath0 101 reveals a complex local interstellar environment . the most prominent feature is a dark lane which cuts across the southeastern corner of the reddened reflection nebula ngc 1579 ( discovered by william herschel in 1788 ) , illuminated by the apparently faint red source lkh@xmath0 101 near the image center .",
    "@xcite argue that this dark lane is in the foreground and probably not associated with lkh@xmath0 101 .",
    "that argument is further supported by the interstellar h@xmath8 chemistry constraints in the vicinity of an intense radiation source @xcite .",
    "the reflection nebula was [ mis]identified as the hii region s222 because of its redness in the palomar survey plates @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent observations showed that the polarization pattern from dust scattering was consistent with a reflection nebula entirely illuminated by lkh@xmath0 101 @xcite . a direct comparison of the optical spectrum of the nebula and lkh@xmath0 101 confirms this conclusion @xcite .",
    "the evidence for an actual hii region is only inferred from the radio continuum spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : none of the optical or infrared lines typical of such physical conditions are present in the spectra of the nebula or lkh@xmath0 101 itself @xcite .",
    "the latter probably could be explained if circumstellar material at high densities collisionally deexcites the standard forbidden emission lines .",
    "additional dark clouds to the north , south , and southwest were noted in coarse - resolution co surveys of the region @xcite . the northern cloud is visible as a lip of material at the edge of the ngc 1579 nebula ( see fig .",

    "consists of : a dense circumstellar disk / envelope ; a small hii region ; a reflection nebula ( ngc 1579 ) ; an hi envelope @xcite ; and a dark cloud ( l1482 ) within a molecular filament .",
    "lkh@xmath0 101 and its associated young cluster are embedded in this cloud filament , denoted tgu 1096 by @xcite and shown in fig .  2 , that extends northwest of the taurus - auriga complex ( @xmath9pc ;",
    "see the chapter in this volume by kenyon , gomez , & whitney ) , and overlaps in projection with the more distant per ob2 association ( @xmath10pc ; see the chapter in this volume by bally et al . ) . despite the apparent proximity of these two star - forming regions ,",
    "the co velocity of the filament is significantly different ( @xmath11 km s@xmath12 ) than for tau - aur ( + 6 km s@xmath12 ) and per ob2 ( + 6 - 10 km s@xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "clearly this filamentary cloud and its contents are kinematically distinct from the tau - aur and per ob2 clouds .",
    "moreover , @xcite note that the interstellar nai absorption lines toward two stars in the young cluster are double , with core velocities consistent with those of per ob2 and material in the filamentary cloud . as noted by those authors , this suggests that the interstellar material , embedded cluster , and lkh@xmath0 101 lie _ beyond _ the per ob2 complex .",
    "101 embedded in it .",
    "the axes are galactic coordinates , and lkh@xmath0 101 is located at @xmath13 , @xmath14 . ]",
    "the sky - projected proximity of lkh@xmath0 101 to both the tau - aur and perseus regions might be expected to create some confusion in estimating the distance to this star and its associated young cluster .",
    "@xcite originally estimated @xmath15pc based on spectra and @xmath16 photometry of 2 early - type ( b ) stars near lkh@xmath0 101 that are associated with nebulosity . as discussed in sect .  2 , the interstellar medium signatures also appear consistent with a distance beyond the perseus clouds ( @xmath17pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite argued that the radio luminosities of some cluster stars would be an order of magnitude larger than the mean for weak - lined t tauri stars in tau - aur if the distance was as large as 800pc .",
    "given the location on the sky and this apparent radio luminosity discrepancy , stine & oneal suggested a much smaller @xmath18pc . using high resolution infrared measurements , @xcite identified both a companion star and a circumstellar disk around lkh@xmath0 101 ( see sect .",
    "5 ) . given the proper motion of the companion and some model constraints on the star+disk mass , they find that @xmath19 - 500pc can best explain the data , with a favored value @xmath20pc .",
    "most recently , @xcite extended the spectroscopic parallax measurements to 40 young cluster stars with a wide range of spectral types ( from mid - m to early b ) to estimate a larger distance , @xmath21pc .",
    "obviously , a definitive conclusion has yet to be reached .",
    "in the meantime , it would pay to consider the various pieces of observational evidence in a self - consistent manner .",
    "perhaps the most straight - forward distance estimate comes from the spectroscopic parallax determinations of cluster members .",
    "these measurements converge on a mean distance of 700pc ; and , although there is a scatter around this value of approximately @xmath22pc , there are no individual measurements consistent with a distance as low as 160pc .",
    "we can turn to the h - r diagram for a consistency check on these values using the derived cluster age ( see sect .",
    "interstellar reddening uncertainties will not significantly affect the age determination because the reddening vector is roughly parallel to the isochrones .",
    "therefore , the adopted distance acts to set the cluster age . as discussed further in sect .  4 , the cluster age is @xmath231myr for @xmath24pc . however , if the true distance were as close as @xmath25pc , the inferred cluster age would be @xmath26myr , and therefore inconsistent with all the obvious indicators of youth that have been observed in the cluster ( e.g. , strong h@xmath0 emission , infrared excesses , etc . ) .    along with the above age - consistency argument and the evidence from the interstellar signatures ( sect .",
    "2 ) , @xcite cautioned against adopting the @xmath27pc estimate advocated by @xcite because only one of the four radio sources used by those authors is clearly associated with a weak - line t tauri star . further coupling this with the fact that none of the other 13 weak - line t tauri stars in the lkh@xmath0 101 cluster were detected in the radio continuum , a comparison of the cluster radio luminosities with the tau - aur weak - line t tauri star mean luminosity does not present a convincing argument for a small cluster distance .",
    "instead , the preponderance of evidence suggests a large cluster distance , with most observational constraints in agreement with @xmath28 - 700pc .",
    "the first hints of an embedded young star cluster in this region came serendipitously from a radio study of the lkh@xmath0 101 stellar wind @xcite .",
    "the radio map revealed a  necklace \" of faint point sources surrounding the central star that in some cases appeared to be associated with optically detected low - mass stars .",
    "those initial observations were revisited by @xcite , who identified more than a dozen compact sources , some of them exhibiting flaring gyrosynchrotron emission similar to those seen around weak - line t tauri stars in tau - aur ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "detailed multiwavelength observing campaigns were conducted soon after the radio discovery @xcite , including broadband optical and infrared imaging , millimeter spectral line maps , and millimeter interferometry of the lkh@xmath0 101 circumstellar environment .",
    "those studies first claimed a large infrared clustering of stars near lkh@xmath0 101 , with an apparent age gradient indicating that the central star was quite young ( @xmath2310@xmath29yr ) .",
    "the latter conclusion remains somewhat an open question , due to the bright and spatially variable nebulosity in the vicinity of the hot star .",
    "these initial near - infrared images were then supplemented with @xmath30-band photometry to better determine the circumstellar properties of the stars in the cluster @xcite .",
    "the color - color analysis in that study suggested that @xmath2330%  of the surveyed stars had excess thermal emission from the inner regions of circumstellar dust disks .",
    "this @xmath30-band excess fraction would be low for the apparent young age of the cluster ( see below ) , according to the fairly well - established correlation noted by @xcite and others .",
    "however , the completeness limit of these observations is difficult to estimate due to the bright infrared nebulosity in the region .",
    "the arrow shows the shift expected for an additional 1 magnitude of visual extinction .",
    "the dashed lines are theoretical isochrones from @xcite ; ages are marked near the bottom of the figure.,height=312 ]    more recently , @xcite presented a comprehensive look at the embedded cluster and lkh@xmath0 101 itself using optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "deep @xmath31 imaging ( see fig .  1 ) enabled these authors to perform a standard analysis of the h - r diagram in an attempt to determine the cluster age .",

    "while acknowledging the very different evolutionary states of these objects and lkh@xmath0 101 , the physical structures responsible for their similar spectra are likely the same : stellar winds and the irradiation of a dense circumstellar disk .",
    "the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of lkh@xmath0 101 , displayed in figure 7 , shows a large infrared excess indicative of thermal continuum emission from circumstellar dust .",
    "@xcite argued that the dip in the sed between @xmath2310 and 20@xmath43 m is not easily explained by the standard circumstellar disk models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this is not likely a significant problem , as the large beam sizes for long - wavelength data often result in flux overestimates from extended emission or the excess emission from other nearby young stars in the cluster .",
    "regardless , the 10@xmath43 m observations of danen et al .  indicated a very small emission source size ( @xmath2350mas ) and warm characteristic dust temperature ( @xmath231000k ) . using the ovro interferometer , @xcite detected unresolved thermal continuum emission ( @xmath50mjy ) at 3 mm from this circumstellar dust .",
    "with the standard optically thin , isothermal dust assumptions and opacity law ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the corresponding mass of circumstellar material ( gas and dust ) is estimated to be @xmath231 - 2m@xmath51 , or roughly 10%  of the proposed stellar mass .",
    "the remarkably bright infrared emission from lkh@xmath0 101 ( @xmath52 ) made it an ideal test subject for the rapidly developing technologies involved in very high - resolution infrared imaging . in a pioneering study by @xcite",
    ", high angular resolution images showed that the infrared emission originatesin a nearly face - on , resolved ( fwhm = 40mas ) disk structure with a large central cavity surrounding the star .",
    "these and other data were shown to be consistent with high - mass disk models that call for an inner region cleared by the sublimation of dust particles by high - energy stellar irradiation and a thick , flared geometry @xcite .",
    "moreover , these same data showed that the infrared emission morphology of the disk actually changes with time and revealed the presence ( and relative proper motion ) of a faint , blue companion star @xmath2302 to the northeast .",
    "figure 8 shows a wider field @xmath53band image with the lkh@xmath0 101 disk and this companion star , as well as a more detailed look at the disk morphology .",
    "@xcite used the motion of the companion star and properties of lkh@xmath0 101 and its disk to estimate an intermediate distance to the source , @xmath20pc .",
    "@xcite noted that the disk geometry proposed by tuthill et al .  could account for the observed splitting of the optical feii lines , offering an interesting connection between the gas and dust in the inner disk",
    "the embedded cluster around lkh@xmath0 101 has been the object of much recent scrutiny , as the subject of an infrared survey with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ and a simultaneous campaign with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and the vla @xcite .",
    "images from the _ spitzer _ and _ chandra _ observations are shown together in figure 9 .",
    "the mid - infrared _ spitzer _ photometry reveals the presence of 16 protostars ( class i sources ) and an additional 95 t tauri stars ( class ii sources ) , along with 9  transition \" objects that show large 24@xmath43 m excesses but only photospheric emission at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the latter are widely interpreted to be circumstellar disks with evacuated inner regions .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "observations identify an additional 65 x - ray sources coincident with infrared stars with near - photospheric colors , consistent with their association as more evolved ( class iii ) cluster members .",
    "this brings the total list of known cluster membership to @xmath23185 , many of which are actively being confirmed spectroscopically @xcite .     101 cluster at _ spitzer _ mid - infrared ( top ) and _ chandra _ x - ray ( bottom ) wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the infrared image is a composite of data at 3.6 ( blue ) , 4.5 ( green ) , and 5.8@xmath43 m ( red ) on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the x - ray image is a composite of three energy ranges : 0.5 - 1.5kev ( red ) , 1.1 - 2.4kev ( green ) , and 2.1 - 8.0kev ( blue).,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in addition to identifying new members and characterizing their evolutionary states via their infrared excess properties , these new data can be utilized to estimate the total cluster size in two complementary ways .",
    "the first method exploits the empirical similarity of the x - ray luminosities from class ii and iii sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "using this assumption that the same fraction of class ii and iii infrared sources should be detected with x - rays , the new observations imply that the @xmath2345%  x - ray detection rate of class ii sources would translate to @xmath2382 undetected class iii sources .",
    "this estimate would bring the total cluster membership to @xmath23270 sources .",
    "the second method relies on the derived shape of the universal x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) for young clusters asserted by @xcite .",
    "if this universal xlf applies for the lkh@xmath0 101 cluster , the total cluster membership should be in the range of 280 - 330 stars , and the smaller cluster distances are firmly ruled out in favor of values in the range @xmath54 - 750pc .",
    "the closer end of this range brings the two methods of estimating cluster membership numbers into good agreement .",
    "this recent work is encouraging in its focus on establishing a firm cluster membership base for future work .",
    "only when a relatively complete membership roster has been obtained can a more comprehensive analysis of the distance , age , initial mass function , circumstellar disk fraction , and other basic properties be derived .",
    "although of less immediate importance , a closer examination of individual cluster members would certainly be interesting .",
    "@xcite present a curious high - resolution spectrum of the bright , nebulous star immediately to the northeast of lkh@xmath0 101 ( their  star d \" , hbc 391 ; see fig .  1 )",
    ", showing it to be an early k giant with a number of strange features .",
    "those authors also note that none of the 5 b - type stars apparently associated with the same dark cloud ( excluding lkh@xmath0 101 ) show the standard signatures of youth noted for other herbig be stars",
    ".    given the high concentration of infrared sources in the immediate vicinity of lkh@xmath0 101 noted by @xcite , high angular resolution infrared images using adaptive optics would provide an interesting complement to the new _ spitzer _ data .",
    "some of the most interesting cluster members may be lurking in the tremendous glare of the central source , including the small group of stars identified by @xcite that lie at one end of a  bar \" of infrared nebulosity ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "along these same lines , those interested in the formation and evolution of massive stars and their disks should make a concerted effort to follow up the high - resolution infrared work of tuthill and colleagues .",
    "high resolution ( sub - arcsecond ) millimeter observations of the dust continuum and various molecular line transitions would aid tremendously in interpreting the circumstellar environment around lkh@xmath0 101 . as with many other clusters in this book ,",
    "the lkh@xmath0 101 region still holds a lot of promise for future observations with more sensitive , higher resolution instrumentation .",
