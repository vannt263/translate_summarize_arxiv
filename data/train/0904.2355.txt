    "star formation in the early universe has played a critical role in subsequent evolution of the universe .",
    "first - generation stars may have substantially contributed to the cosmic reionization and metal pollution of the universe by their radiative / kinetic feedback effects .",
    "these events are important for the formation and evolution of protogalaxies .",
    "the studies of the initial collapse of primordial pre - galactic objects in the @xmath0cdm universe have been done in both analytical @xcite and numerical method @xcite .",
    "these objects are formed with masses of the order of @xmath7 at redshifts @xmath8 .",
    "theoretical studies suggested that in these low - mass halos , @xmath9 molecules are formed up to the level of @xmath10 , because the virial temperature and the central density of these halos are high enough to activate h@xmath4 formation @xcite so that the cooling time becomes short enough .",
    "this small fraction of h@xmath4 is sufficient to cool the gas , which leads to the formation of first - generation stars in these halos .",
    "early studies on the formation of primordial stars have been done in almost one - zone approximation @xcite . on the other hand , after 1990s , there have been a number of numerical studies of the formation of primordial stars .",
    "these studies consistently suggested that first - generation stars are very massive ( @xmath11 ) . because of their extreme mass scale ,",
    "first - generation stars emit copious amount of ionizing radiation , as well as a strong flux of @xmath9-dissociating lyman - werner ( lw ) band radiation .",
    "therefore , the radiation from the first stars dramatically influences their surroundings , heating and ionizing the gas within a few kiloparsecs around the progenitor star .",
    "if the primeval star is very massive ( @xmath12 ) , the ionization front from the star will break out of parent halos up to @xmath13 in mass .",
    "half of the baryons in the halo will be swept up into a dense shell that grows to the virial radius of the halo ( @xmath14 ) by the end of the life of the star .",
    "therefore , the gas density within the shell radius will drastically decrease to low uniform densities of @xmath15 prior to the supernova ( sn ) explosion @xcite .",
    "the dark halos are also affected by the radiation from the first star in the neighboring halos .",
    "the local radiative feedback effect is sensitive to the distance from the source star , as well as the mass and the evolutionary stage of the target halo .",
    "the ionizing radiation from the star totally or partially photoevaporates them before the sn blast ever reaches them @xcite .",
    "therefore , these halos will be less massive or be gone altogether by the time the sn shock strikes them .",
    "it is also should be noted that the lw band radiation from the source star photodissociates h@xmath4 molecules in these halos in case the halos are located close enough to the source @xcite .",
    "some of massive primordial stars end their lives as energetic sne .",
    "@xcite suggested that the progenitor star of @xmath16 dies in type ii sn blasts while those of @xmath17 dies in pair instability sn . on the other hand , it is important to note that some pop iii stars lying in between the ranges indicated above may also explode as hypernovae @xcite .",
    "the studies of first sn explosions have been performed in both sph @xcite and grid codes @xcite . in less massive halos ( @xmath18 ) ,",
    "the ejecta first expands into a nearly uniform rarefied ionized medium , then interacts violently with the dense shell swept up in the progenitor h ii region .",
    "part of the energy of the blast wave is reflected into the center as a reverse shock and the rest pushes the shell forward @xcite . in massive parent halos ( @xmath19 ) , however , the sn remnant ( snr ) will only expand @xmath20 into the halo and then recollapse @xcite , never reaching any nearby halos because the _ i_-front does not break out these parent halos prior to the sn explosion .",
    "the shock wave from an sn that break away from the host halo impact and go through the neighboring halos those survived photoevaporation process .",
    "the shock wave may blow off the gas component ; however , it also promote the formation of @xmath9 and hd molecules in the gas because of the enhanced electron abundance by the shock heating @xcite .",
    "we also note that the relic h ii region including the photoevaporated halos recombines out of equilibrium , which is basically same physical condition of the postshock enhancement of h@xmath4/hd formation .",
    "the sn shock can sweep up this h@xmath4/hd and carry it into the nearby halo .",
    "therefore , these molecules in the fossil h ii region are important for the formation of secondary stars as well as those would be formed in the sn shock by collisional ionization .",
    "star formation could be triggered by snrs in several ways .",
    "primordial snrs may sweep up a dense shell of ambient gas or collide with the dense shell swept up by an h ii region , either of which becomes contaminated by metals in the ejecta , subsequently comes to be dominated by its self - gravity . as a result",
    ", the shell is expected to fragment into smaller filaments / cores where populations of less massive stars are formed @xcite . on the other hand , in rather massive halos ( @xmath21 ) , the h ii region generated by the progenitor star is confined well inside the virial radius and the gas is kept neutral . in this case , first snrs expand in neutral halos , heavily mix their interiors with heavy elements , and then recollapse without escaping the halo @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the first sn with neighboring halos in the early universe has not been investigated in detail so far .",
    "recently , @xcite performed a cosmological simulation of first sn explosion .",
    "they found that the shock from the sn can accelerate the star formation process in neighboring rather massive halos in which stars could be formed without feedback effects .",
    "they also indicated that if the sn explosion occurs in an h ii region , the snr comes to pressure equilibrium at half of the radius of the relic h ii region because of its relatively large temperatures .",
    "this limits the reach of the sn explosion to @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite performed numerical simulation of snrs ram - pressure stripping cosmological halos .",
    "they focus on how heavy elements from the remnant are mixed with the halo gas .",
    "however , the number of halos studied by numerical simulations is restricted .",
    "more analytical criteria are needed in order to obtain a systematic understanding of first sn feedback effects on neighboring dark matter halos . in this paper , we investigate feedback effects by first sn onto the nearby halos in the early universe , which is potentially important for the total star formation activities in the early universe .",
    "we use analytic arguments in order to obtain the universal criteria for feedback effects by first sn on the neighboring dark halos .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the initial setup and the description of snr evolution are given in section 2 . in section 3 and 4 ,",
    "the sn feedback effects are listed and quantified .",
    "section 5 and 6 are devoted to discussion and summary .",
    "we consider sn explosions in the first collapsed halos ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the gravitational potential of these halos are so shallow that the ionizing radiation from the progenitor first stars can sweep out the gas of the host halos @xcite . as a result",
    ", the subsequent sne can easily break away from the halo because of the decreased gas density by photoionization prior to the explosion @xcite . in order to understand the nature of the sn shock expanding into an essentially uniform and ionized intergalactic space ,",
    "we assume spherical symmetry and initially uniform ambient gas density of averaged cosmological density , @xmath24 . strictly speaking",
    ", this assumption is not valid since the gas density of the halo still slightly higher than @xmath24 even after the feedback of uv radiation .",
    "this assumption should have some effects to increase the energy of the sn shock , but we use this for simplicity .",
    "the energy loss mechanism from the snr is dominated by bremsstrahlung for a first few years , then line emission , and then inverse compton scattering becomes important @xcite .",
    "we take into account all of the cooling rate stated above as well as @xmath9 cooling at low temperature .",
    "we use the fitting formula for these rates from the compilation by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we consider the neighboring dark matter halos with total mass of @xmath25 , whose baryonic fraction in mass is assumed to be the cosmic mean value , @xmath26 .",
    "we have another free parameter in our calculations , which is the distance from the sn center to the target halo .",
    "additionally , we use two typical fixed redshift when the sn explode ( @xmath27 ) and when the nearby halos virialized ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we tested this issue with three different sn explosion energy @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . throughout the paper",
    ", we work with the @xmath0cdm universe with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "we introduce three timescales @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , that characterize the important physical processes .",
    "they represent the sound crossing timescale of the gas component in the neighboring halo , the cooling timescale , and the free - fall timescale , respectively . the sound crossing timescale of the gas component in the neighboring halo is described as @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the length that we are interested and @xmath40 is the sound speed of the gas , respectively .",
    "this timescale is also interpreted as the expansion timescale of the shock heated gas if we substitute the size of the shock - heated region for @xmath39 and use the sound speed of shocked gas as @xmath40 .",
    "the cooling timescale is defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the temperature and the number density , @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the boltzmann constant and the ratio of specific heats , respectively .",
    "@xmath46 represents the fraction of @xmath9 , and @xmath0 ( @xmath47 ) denotes the cooling rate of gas .",
    "the free - fall timescale is written as @xmath48    here , @xmath49 is the gravitational constant and @xmath50 is the virial density given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 g @xmath53 .",
    "the time evolution of an snr in intergalactic medium ( igm ) is mainly described by following four stages :    ( 1 ) : :    _ the free - expansion stage_. the free - expansion stage lasts until the    sn ejecta sweeps up roughly the same amount of mass as their own in    the surrounding medium . in this stage ,",
    "the velocity of the sn ejecta    decreases linearly with radius @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) : :    _ sedov  taylor adiabatic expansion stage_. the expansion of the shock    front is well approximated by the sedov ",
    "taylor solution .",
    "( 3 ) : :    _ pressure - driven expansion stage_. after the postshock gas is cooled    via the radiative cooling , the snr depart from an adiabatic expansion .    geometrically thin shell is formed just behind the shock front .",
    "the    expansion of the shocked shell is driven by the high pressure of the    hot cavity .",
    "( 4 ) : :    _ momentum - driven expansion stage_. in this stage , the shocked shell    expands conserving its momentum .    in our calculation , we do not take into consideration the stage ( 1 ) because the duration of this stage is very short and it hardly affects the entire result .",
    "we also do not consider the stage ( 4 ) in igm since the shock velocity at this stage is too small to activate h@xmath4 molecule formation or to evacuate the gas from the halo .",
    "we consider the scenario , in which the snr gradually sweeps up mass and then collides with the neighbor halo .",
    "in fact , the remnant first collides violently with the dense shell swept up in the progenitor h ii region , but we leave this effect for future works , since introducing such effect makes the analysis complicated .",
    "the expansion of the shock front in the sedov ",
    "taylor adiabatic stage is described by the self - similar solution @xcite . the radius and the expansion velocity of the shock front",
    "is written as @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent the sn explosion energy and the ambient density , respectively .",
    "the postshock temperature is derived from the sedov ",
    "taylor solution and the rankine ",
    "hugoniot relation as follows : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the atomic mass unit and the mean molecular weight , respectively .",
    "these solutions are based upon the assumption , that the gas is adiabatic , however , the postshock gas forms a dense shell which is cooled by the radiative cooling subsequently . after the cooling timescale of the shell becomes shorter than the expansion timescale of the shell ( @xmath61 ) , the snr move on to the pressure - driven expansion stage .",
    "the shock front expands by the high pressure in the hot cavity .",
    "we assume that the pressure inside the cavity decreases adiabatically as @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the pressure inside the cavity , and also @xmath64 and @xmath65 represent the radius of the shock front and the postshock pressure at the beginning of the pressure - driven expansion stage . combining this equation with the equation of motion of the shell",
    ", we have the shock radius / velocity as follows @xcite .",
    "@xmath66    we also obtain the postshock temperature as follows : @xmath67      in the present paper , we do not take into account the cooling rate due to heavy elements .",
    "in fact , the shock - heated gas in the nearby halos is expected to be polluted by metals ejected from the sn , although the abundance of heavy elements in the shock - heated gas is hard to evaluate .",
    "the ultra high resolution simulations would be indispensable to assess the degree of metal mixing . aside from such difficulty",
    ", we can evaluate the metal abundance assuming complete mixing between the sn ejecta and the surrounding material .",
    "based upon such assumption , the mean metallicity of the swept up mass by the sn shock is @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the metallicity of the high-_z _ igm observed by ly@xmath69 absorption systems is at a level of @xmath70 to @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath70 to @xmath71 could be a rough standard to assess the effects of metal cooling . at such low metallicity , the radiative cooling rate is hardly affected above @xmath72k @xcite , since it is dominated by h and he cooling .",
    "the cooling rate below @xmath72 k is basically proportional to the amount of metals @xcite , however , again at such low @xmath73 , the metal cooling rate is comparable to h@xmath4 cooling , as long as @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "therefore , radiative cooling by heavy elements in these halos do not play central role as long as complete mixing is assumed .    on the other hand , metals in the interior of expanding snr",
    "will mix with the shocked shell it sweeps up because of rayleigh  taylor and kelvin  helmholtz instabilities .",
    "this will enrich the shocked region to much higher metallicities than @xmath75 , radiatively cool the shell much faster than any h@xmath4 it has formed or swept up , and then fragment clumps .",
    "it may be a clump that collides with the neighbor halo , not an intact shell , but this is for future numerical studies to determine .     before the shocked gas cools by radiative cooling .",
    "after that , the shock propagates under the momentum conservation .",
    "the intermediate case ( case(ii ) ) indicates that the shock shifts to the momentum - driven expansion phase in the halo . ]",
    "in this section , we assess the effect of the sn shock onto neighboring dark halos by analytic arguments comparing timescales .      in case",
    "a neighboring halo is located very close to the center of the sn explosion , the gas in the halo would be evacuated by the shock momentum . as a result ,",
    "subsequent star formation in the halo should be inhibited . assuming the momentum conservation",
    "after the gas behind the shock cools , we can roughly evaluate the velocity of the gas in the halo after the impact of the shocked shell .    in figure [",
    "fig : fig1 ] , we represent three cases of gas evacuation by shock momentum .",
    "first , we consider the simple momentum conserving case ( case(i ) in figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) , where @xmath76 ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) is satisfied . here , @xmath78 denotes the distance that the shock sweeps the halo before it enters the momentum conserving phase , i.e. , @xmath79    here , @xmath80 is the radius of the dark halo .",
    "the equation of the momentum conservation is given as follows : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the mass of the dark halo and @xmath83 is the mass of the gas shell colliding with the halo , which is given as @xmath84    here , @xmath85 is the mass of progenitor popiii star and we assume that the whole mass of this popiii star is released as ejecta .",
    "we assume @xmath86 in the present calculation .    on the other hand , in case of @xmath87 ( i.e. , @xmath88 , case(ii ) in figure [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) , the gas in the halo is cooled while the shock propagates in the halo by radiative cooling , and it evolves into the momentum conserving phase . since the gas pressure of the halo behind the shock front can keep pushing the shock before it cools , @xmath89 can not be estimated by simple momentum conservation equation .",
    "it is difficult to assess this effect analytically .",
    "thus , we assume that the shock velocity is not affected by the halo while the radiative cooling is still inefficient even after the shock enters the halo .",
    "this assumption could be oversimplification , since even adiabatic shock will slow down to some extent when it enters the dense region . in order to quantify this effect ,",
    "numerical study would be necessary , which is beyond the scope of present study .",
    "therefore , we have to keep in mind that the shock heating effect is maximally taken into consideration in this model . in this intermediate case ( ( ii ) in figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) , we assume that the momentum conservation after shocked gas in the halo is cooled : @xmath90    in case the shock propagate through the entire halo within the cooling time of the shocked gas , that is the case of @xmath91 , the shock velocity in the halo is as large as @xmath92 during the shock propagation because of the inefficient cooling ( case ( iii ) in figure [ fig : fig1 ] )",
    ".    the velocity of the shocked gas shell , @xmath89 , is obtained from the equation ( [ eq : mon_cos ] ) as follows : @xmath93 this equation includes all of the three cases .",
    "the cases of @xmath94 and @xmath91 are the limits of efficient / inefficient cooling .    )",
    "is plotted as a function of the distance from the sn center , @xmath95 , for @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the dotted line represents the escape velocity of the halo with @xmath97 . ]",
    "the gas will be still bounded in the halo even after the shock arrival , in case @xmath89 is smaller than the escape velocity @xmath98 of the halo . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath99 , the gas is blown away from the halo potential , in which subsequent star formation in the halo is totally quenched .",
    "thus , we regard the condition @xmath100 as a necessary condition for the triggered star formation in the neighboring dark halos .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , @xmath89 , as a function of the distance from the sn center assuming @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in this case",
    ", @xmath89 is smaller than @xmath98 in the ranges @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , in case the neighboring halo is located at such distance , the gas in the halo is not evacuated by the shock momentum .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the gas evacuation from the halos for @xmath96 .",
    "the vertical axis denotes the mass of the dark matter halos ( @xmath82 ) , whereas the horizontal axis represents the distance from the sn center . in the hatched area denoted as @xmath100 ,",
    "the gas in the dark halos are not lost by the shock momentum .",
    "it is worth noting that the hatched area around @xmath105kpc corresponds to @xmath106k , where the ly@xmath69 cooling dominates the others .    .",
    "the horizontal axis shows the distance between the nearby halo and sn center , while the vertical axis denotes the mass of the halo . in the hatched area ( @xmath100 )",
    ", the shocked gas is bounded inside the dark halo .",
    "the unhatched region labeled as @xmath99 , the gas will be evacuated by the shock from the sn . ]",
    "the halos that satisfies the condition @xmath100 are able to survive the disruption by the sn shock momentum . as a next step",
    ", we consider whether those survived halos can collapse or not .",
    "we set the collapse criteria as the condition where the gas temperature is decreased below @xmath107 , before the gas cloud expands by the thermal pressure , or bounces by adiabatic compression . in other words , if following conditions @xmath108 are both satisfied until they cool below the initial virial temperature , we regard that the gas in such halos can collapse to form stars . here , we consider the sound crossing timescale , @xmath109 , to be the expansion timescale of the shocked region . in general , the condition @xmath110 is regarded as the collapse criterion of gravitationally bound system ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "once this condition is satisfied , the system starts to collapse .",
    "the cooling timescale in low - density gas is basically inversely proportional to the density , while the free - fall timescale proportional to the inverse of square root of density . as a result",
    ", the ratio @xmath111 gets smaller as the collapse proceeds .",
    "that s why the condition is regarded as the collapse criterion . in case",
    "we consider the primordial star formation , the cooling timescale in most of the final run - away collapse phase is not proportional to the inverse of density , however , the absolute value of the cooling timescale is shorter than the other timescales outside the halo .",
    "thus , the collapse of the cloud continues following the track along which @xmath112 is satisfied .",
    "in addition , we have to consider the adiabatic expansion of the shocked gas , since the sound crossing timescale of the shocked gas could be very short in the present case .",
    "thus , we need to add the inequality @xmath113 to the condition of the collapse criteria .    in order to assess this condition",
    ", we have to follow the thermal evolution of the shock heated gas in the dark halo .",
    "each of the four panels in figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the evolution of timescales after the shock heating for halos with @xmath114 located at @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "thermal energy of the sn explosion is assumed as @xmath117 .",
    "the horizontal axes denote the temperature of the gas on the way of cooling , whereas the vertical axes show timescales . in order to assess the cooling timescale for @xmath118k",

    "h@xmath4 fraction could be obtained by solving nonequilibrium chemical reaction equations , however , approximate values are already obtained .",
    "we use @xmath119 in case the postshock temperature , @xmath120 , is less than @xmath72k @xcite , whereas @xmath121 is employed for @xmath122k @xcite .",
    "if the halo with @xmath123 is located at @xmath124 ( upper - left panel ) , the shocked temperature is too high for the gas to remain the gas inside the halo potential .",
    "in fact , expansion timescale is already shorter than the cooling timescale at @xmath125 .",
    "thus , the gas in this halo is lost because of the shock heating . on the other hand , in the cases of @xmath126 ( upper - right panel ) , @xmath127 ( lower - left panel ) , and @xmath128 ( lower - right panel ) ,",
    "the gas in the halo can start to cool because @xmath129 is smaller than @xmath130 at @xmath125 . among these examples",
    ", @xmath129 is shorter than @xmath131 and @xmath130 as long as @xmath132 is satisfied in the case @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , the gas can be cooled below @xmath107 before it expands , and the cooling phase could be followed by gravitational contraction .",
    "in contrast , in the cases of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , the cooling process becomes inefficient before @xmath133 is achieved . in the case of @xmath134 ,",
    "the postshock temperature exceeds @xmath72k .",
    "thus , @xmath135 is achieved even for @xmath136k , whereas @xmath119 for @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , the cooling condition is not simply determined by the efficiency of h@xmath4 formation , although it is necessary for the cooling below @xmath72k .",
    "the allowed region for cooling / collapse of the shocked gas is shown in the next section .",
    "now , we are ready to combine all conditions to find the criteria for positive / negative feedback effects by first sne on the neighboring dark halos .",
    "three panels in figure [ fig : fig5 ] correspond to the results with @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , respectively .",
    "extremely energetic cases with @xmath139 and @xmath138 can be interpreted as the hypernova or the pair - instability sn .",

    "in the shaded region denoted as `` cool '' , postshock gas cools below @xmath107 . ]",
    "first of all , gas components in dark matter halos considered here ( @xmath142 ) are blown away by the shock momentum if the halos are close enough to the sn center .",
    "the critical distance within which the gas is evacuated falls within the range @xmath6kpc depending on the sn energy and mass of the halo . in case",
    "we assume normal core - collapse sn ( @xmath143erg ) , the critical distance is @xmath144 kpc , whereas it is @xmath145kpc for pair - instability sn ( @xmath146erg ) .",
    "the mass dependence is not so strong , but basically the low - mass halos are more fragile than the massive halos . in addition , we also note that the boundaries of the survive regions have complicated structures at @xmath147kpc , reflecting the shape of the cooling function .",
    "recent studies suggested that halos further than @xmath148 from the original star will not be reached by the blast . in the present paper , we include distances greater than this in our analysis , but we are doing so only for completeness .",
    "the region where `` survive '' and `` cool '' are compatible with each other correspond to the case that the shock - heated gas successfully cooled and collapse in the dark halo .",
    "however , it is clear that the halos which can survive the evacuation by the sn shock and collapse do not exist .",
    "consequently , the sn feedback has basically negative effects on the star formation in surrounding halos .",
    "the nearby dark halos come under the influence of the radiation from the sn progenitor star on the satellite halos prior to the explosion .",
    "thus , many low - mass dark halos might be photoevaporated by the uv flux of progenitor star .",
    "one - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations are performed by @xcite on this issue .",
    "they found that effects of radiative feedback on the gravitational contraction of the gas in low - mass halos ( @xmath149 ) are very complicated .",
    "the feedback effects are qualitatively different depending on the distance from the source star , evolutionary stage of the halo at the onset of radiative feedback , and mass of the halo .",
    "@xcite also have investigated on this problem by two - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations , for a single halo with mass of @xmath150 , in which they take into account a detailed evolutionary stage of the halo .",
    "they found that most of the gas in this halo is photoevaporated by the sn progenitor star prior to its death at very early evolutionary stages of the halo . on the other hand",
    ", they indicated that the _",
    "i_-front could not reach the core of the halo and this core survived quite well if central densities of the halo rose beyond @xmath151 .",
    "@xcite also performed three - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations with realistic cosmological density field .",
    "they found the h ii region of 100@xmath152 popiii star extend to @xmath153kpc , within which most of low - mass halos are photoevaporated .",
    "however , the number of survived halos through uv flux from progenitor star is still under debate , since we only have the results by multidimensional simulations with restricted parameter space ( mass of the halo , mass of the progenitor star ) . in any case",
    ", it is worth to investigate the effects of sn shock on the nearby halos with various parameters by analytical calculations .    in our study , we completely ignore mass loss in the neighbor halos due to photoevaporation by the progenitor star .",
    "therefore , it must be noted that our results are taken to be a lower limit on the damage done by the expanding remnant to the halo because the halos the sn blast actually encounters will have less gas .",
    "also the negative feedback effect we have found applies only to the one scenario , in which the snr increasingly sweeps up mass and then collides with the neighboring halo",
    ". it could be that sn directly form more stars by other means than those they quench in nearby halos in our mechanism .",
    "we have studied the feedback effects by first sne with @xmath154 , and @xmath138 on their neighboring dark matter halos .",
    "consequently , the conclusion can be summarized as follows .",
    "we find that the star formation activities in the neighboring dark matter halos ( @xmath5 ) are basically suppressed in case they are located close to the sn center , because of the gas evacuation effect .",
    "the critical distance within which the gas is blown away falls within the range @xmath6kpc depending on the sn energy and the halo mass . in case",
