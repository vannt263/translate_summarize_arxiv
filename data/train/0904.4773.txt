    "the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics given by glashow , weinberg and salam described by the @xmath0 gauge group satisfactorily explains most of the phenomena observed so far on the fundamental interactions @xcite .",
    "however , this model is widely believed to be incomplete .",
    "indeed a question of great importance is whether there is any new physics beyond the highly celebrated sm of elementary particles .",
    "any kind of experimental evidence supporting the extensions of the sm like the left - right symmetric model @xcite , the multi - higgs model @xcite or supersymmetry models @xcite will have a significant impact on our understanding of the fundamental forces between the elementary particles in nature .",
    "detailed studies of the fundamental interactions have a bearing on chemical and biological processes as well .",
    "for example , the violation of parity is believed to be one of the fundamental reasons behind the `` homochirality '' of bio - molecules @xcite . in the same vein , any time reversal symmetry ( @xmath1 ) violation will lead to a certain asymmetry in chemical phenomena whose importance will depend on the actual magnitude of the asymmetry observed in the experiments .",
    "a case in point is the emergence of enantiomorphic excess where none is expected from the electromagnetic interaction @xcite .",
    "one can in fact , distinguish between the chirality brought out by @xmath1-invariant and @xmath1-noninvariant enantiomorphism , introducing the concept of `` false chirality '' in the latter situation .",
    "clearly if the predictions by the sm and those beyond , relating to certain symmetry violations are observed , they will have profound chemical and biological implications .",
    "additionally , if the predictions from the sm and some of its extensions differ , then this will lead to different expected magnitudes of the effect .",
    "this may bring observational efficiency to the limit achievable currently .",
    "fixing the limit of observability then depends on the accuracy of electronic structure theories @xcite .",
    "this is why studies on the predictions as defined by the sm and beyond are of immediate interest to chemists .",
    "the edm ( @xmath2 ) associated with the nondegenerate state of a physical system like an atom can be shown to be proportional to the angular momentum ( @xmath3 ) of that on the basis of the wigner - eckart theorem @xcite .",
    "it can be proved that the existence of a nonzero electric dipole moment ( edm ) which is the expectation value of operator @xmath2 in a given atomic state would imply the violations of the @xmath1 invariance and parity ( @xmath4 ) symmetries @xcite .",
    "the sm which conserves the combined transformations of charge conjugation ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath4 and @xmath1 symmetries ( known as the cpt theorem @xcite ) , predicts @xmath4 and @xmath6 violations in weak interactions . a possible observation of a nonzero edm in an atom would be a direct signature of @xmath1 violation .",
    "an edm has not been observed so far for whether in elementary particles or composite systems .",
    "the sm predicts an upper limit on the electron edm of the order of @xmath7 @xcite , while other suggested models predict this value almost ten orders of magnitude larger .",
    "therefore , measurements of edm in atomic systems are necessary to test the sm .",
    "thus , an unambiguous observation of a nonzero edm of any fundamental particle including the electron will undoubtedly unveil a new arena of physics beyond the sm .",
    "a direct measurement of the electron edm is not possible using accelerator approaches due to the charge of the electron , however it could be obtained by combining the results measurements and calculations of atomic edms using the table - top experiments .    in 1963 , schiff @xcite argued that the permanent edm of an atom vanishes under the assumption that the constituents of non - relativistic point - like systems interact only electrostatically .",
    "it was , however , put forth by salpeter @xcite and sachs and scwebel @xcite as early as 1958 - 1959 that when relativistic effects are included it is possible for an edm on the electron to give rise to an edm on the atom as a whole .",
    "later , it was rigorously proved by sandars @xcite that by introducing the correct relativistic form of the interaction hamiltonian into the dirac equation in a lorentz covariant manner , as emphasized by salpeter , one will get non - zero edm for the atom when an electron is assumed to have intrinsic edm .    in principle",
    ", an atom being a composite many - body system will have many sources of intrinsic edms arising from its constituent particles and their @xmath8 violating electron - nucleus interactions . at the elementary particle level",
    "; electrons may possess intrinsic edms , describing by a coupling constant @xmath9 which may directly contribute to the atomic edm .",
    "the electron edm can also interact with the central electrostatic field of an atom and can produce an atomic edm .",
    "the interactions between electrons - quarks may manifest at different levels as electrons - nucleons to electrons - nucleus interactions .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 violating electron - nucleus interactions can either be scalar  pseudo - scalar ( s - ps ) , with a coupling constant @xmath12 or a tensor  pseudo - tensor ( t - pt ) interaction describing with a coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "the paramagnetic ( open - shell ) atoms will in general be sensitive to the contribution from the intrinsic edm of the electrons and their @xmath14-violating s - ps interactions with the nucleus whereas , the edm in diamagnetic ( closed - shell ) atoms will arise from the edm of the nucleus and their @xmath14-violating t - pt interactions with the electrons .",
    "this can be understood as the electron edm is a spin dependent property , hence it contributes to open - shell atoms because of the unpaired valence electron . however , for a closed - shell atom because of the fermi exclusion principle , it will add up to zero if hyperfine interactions are excluded . these @xmath10- and @xmath11-violating electron - nucleus interactions will provide a useful tool in understanding the @xmath15 violation from the semi - leptonic sectors .",
    "using the knowledge of @xmath15-violation obtained in these atomic edm experiments one can also constrain different models of @xmath15-violation .",
    "it was shown by sandars that by choosing suitable atoms and favorable electronic states one can get an enhanced edm for an atom which may even be a few orders of magnitude larger than that of the free electron @xcite . in particular , he demonstrated by carrying out relativistic calculations that the atomic edms of thallium ( tl ) and caesium ( cs ) are two orders of magnitude larger than the edm of the electron .",
    "it was this important result which provided the impetus for the first generation of atomic edm experiments that were carried out in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "it was realized quickly that the edm _ enhancement factor _",
    "@xmath16 defined as the ratio of atomic edm to the electron edm increases with increase in the nuclear charge ( @xmath17 ) and also if there are close lying states of opposite parity since it is inversely proportional to the difference in their near degenerate energy levels .",
    "hence , heavy rare - earth atoms with anomalously close energy levels of opposite parity , have large edm enhancement factors .",
    "these factors are also fairly large for heavy alkali atoms .",
    "the enhancement factor is proportional to @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fine structure constant .",
    "this formula for order of magnitude estimate of edm enhancement factors illustrates the dependence on nuclear charge @xmath17 and the angular momentum @xmath3 which implies that @xmath16 is large for high @xmath17 and low @xmath3 .",
    "the ground state edms of heavy neutral alkali atoms are of considerable interest to experimentalists , because : ( i ) the edms in these cases are several orders of magnitude larger than that of the electron , unlike in the hydrogen atom where the enhancement factor is large only for the @xmath20 excited state , however , it can be easily perturbed by external electric fields and is therefore not amenable to sensitive experiments , ( ii ) the availability of commercial lasers whose operating frequencies match with those of the resonant energies needed for causing transitions between the low lying levels and ( iii ) the large polarizabilities of these atoms    the edm of an atom or any other neutral particle is determined experimentally by applying an external static electric field to the atom and measuring its shift in energy that results from the interaction of the edm with the electric field .",
    "consider an atom which has a permanent edm as well as a magnetic dipole moment . in the presence of a static electric field @xmath21 and a magnetic field @xmath22 , the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are , respectively , the electric and magnetic dipole moment operators .",
    "the application of the external fields leads to a precession of the atom . the precession ( larmor ) frequency is primarily due to the magnetic dipole moment , but there is also a small contribution from the edm .",
    "the observable in an edm experiment is the difference in the larmor frequencies corresponding to parallel and antiparallel configurations of @xmath21 and @xmath22 - reversal of @xmath21 relative to @xmath22 .",
    "this change in frequency is @xmath26 it corresponds to @xmath27 for d@xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this frequency shift corresponds to a magnetic field of @xmath30 g for a diamagnetic atom and @xmath31 g for a paramagnetic atom .",
    "one of the most important systematic errors in the edm experiment is the magnetic field that is produced by the motion of the atoms .",
    "this field to first order in @xmath32 is given in the moving frame of the atoms as @xmath33 for v = 300 m / s and e = 10 kv / cm , the motional magnetic field @xmath34 = 3@xmath35 g .",
    "this magnetic field can give rise to a frequency shift which can mimic an edm .",
    "in the tl experiment , two counter - propagating beams are used to minimize this effect @xcite .",
    "edm experiments using optically pumped atoms in a cell have a zero average velocity and are therefore not affected very much by the motional magnetic field @xcite . both the beam and the cell experiments have their advantages and disadvantages . while it is possible to apply larger electric fields in the beam experiments , the coherence times are longer in the cell experiments .",
    "the motional magnetic fields often limit the sensitivity of the former , while leakage currents give rise to systematic errors in the latter and they can not be estimated easily .",
    "edm experiments based on laser cooled and trapped atoms in principle have the advantages of both the beam and the cell experiments @xcite .",
    "in these experiments , one can apply large electric fields and the coherence times are long .",
    "the leakage current problem can be overcome using a suitable configuration for the laser trap .",
    "the systematic error due to the motional magnetic field is virtually non - existent because of the extremely low average velocity of the cold atoms .",
    "the procedure of the atomic edm measurements with cold atoms is as follows : first , a fast atomic beam from a hot oven is slowed down by using the zeeman - tuning method .",
    "after this pre - cooling stage , the atoms are trapped and cooled by a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) . a high density and large number of atoms",
    "is then loaded into the mot within several seconds .",
    "then the atomic beam and the magnetic field for the mot is switched off , the detuning of the trapping laser is increased and its intensity reduced .",
    "this results in further cooling to the micro kelvin region by the polarization - gradient method .",
    "the next step is to perform optical pumping to polarize the nuclear spin by the application of a circularly polarized resonant light pulse after completely switching off the laser fields .",
    "finally , a high power laser for a far blue - detuned dipole forced trap and also a high static electric field for the edm measurement is switched on .",
    "a probe laser beam will be used to measure the larmor precession frequency .",
    "the loading and measurement procedure is repeated many times to reduce the statistical uncertainty .",
    "atomic theory is needed in combination with experiments to extract a variety of t violating coupling constants . following a series of insightful calculations of atomic edms by sandars in the 1960s and 1970s based on the relativistic central field potential @xcite , a number of relativistic many - body calculations on atoms of experimental interest",
    "have been carried out in the last two decades @xcite .",
    "ingenious experiments were initiated in the 1980s to observe the edms of mercury ( hg ) , cs and tl @xcite .",
    "subsequently systematic errors have been improved in these experiments and today the most accurate results are available in hg @xcite for diamagnetic atoms and tl for paramagnetic atoms @xcite .",
    "polar molecules seem to be better candidates than heavy atoms for observing edms arising from the electron edm and there have been recent attempts to calculate the observable in some of the molecular edm experiments @xcite .",
    "however , these calculations are in their infancy . in contrast",
    ", it is possible to perform very accurate calculations on alkali atoms .",
    "therefore , to shed light on physics beyond the sm or in fact to observe a nonzero atomic edm , the heaviest of the alkali atoms , francium ( fr ) seems to be another suitable candidate for its relatively simple spectroscopic levels and and large enhancement factor .",
    "a number of spectroscopic analysis on fr has been carried out at suny stony brook using laser trapping technique @xcite and it has been proposed both for edm @xcite and atomic parity violation ( apv ) @xcite measurements .",
    "in fact , there is a preliminary calculation available for the enhancement factor of fr using radial integrals for a few matrix elements @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we will demonstrate an approach using the relativistic coupled - cluster method that includes coulomb interaction among electrons to all orders and @xmath4 and @xmath1 violating electron - nucleus pseudoscalar interaction due to electron edm up to first order but involving contributions from continuum and all possible single and double excited states to calculate @xmath16 in fr . in this procedure",
    ", we will also demonstrate contribution from important intermediate states and highlight the role of various electron correlation effects .",
    "and @xmath4 symmetries is necessary for a non - zero electric dipole moment.,width=302 ]    the three discrete symmetries - charge conjugation ( @xmath5 ) , space inversion or parity ( @xmath4 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath1 ) are related by the well - known cpt theorem @xcite . according to this theorem , while a physical system described by a local field theory may violate any one of these symmetries independently , it is invariant under the combined operation of all three of them .",
    "the combined operation of @xmath5 and @xmath4 ( @xmath6 ) was thought to be a good symmetry till 1964 when christenson et al observed its violation in the decay of k@xmath36 meson @xcite . using the cpt theorem ,",
    "one arrives at the conclusion that this observation implies @xmath1 violation .",
    "an observation of an electric dipole moment ( edm ) of a non - degenerate physical system would be a direct signature of the violations of @xmath1 as well as @xmath4 symmetries @xcite .",
    "consider a physical system with non - zero angular momentum that has a permanent edm , @xmath24 .",
    "the vector @xmath24 like the magnetic dipole moment will be parallel or antiparallel to @xmath37 , the angular momentum of the system @xcite . under the action of @xmath1 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath37 , @xmath1 invariance implies @xmath24 = 0 . if a transformation is carried out under @xmath4 , @xmath40 but @xmath41 , and this leads to @xmath24 = 0 for @xmath4 invariance .",
    "one therefore concludes that @xmath1 and @xmath4 must be violated independently for the existence of a non - zero edm .",
    "the above arguments are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ edmfig ] .      in a manner analogous to the anomalous magnetic moment",
    ", one can introduce an electric dipole moment for a single electron in an electromagnetic field in a lorentz covariant manner into the dirac equation .",
    "the only difference is that it contains a pseudo - scalar dirac operator @xmath42 .",
    "the pseudo - scalar perturbation hamiltonian for the intrinsic edm of an electron then reads , @xmath43 where @xmath9 is the intrinsic edm of the electron .    in the pauli approximation ,",
    "( [ hedm - ft ] ) reduces , in atomic units , to @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the dirac matrices , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the total electric and magnetic fields at the site of the electron .",
    "the second term in the rhs of eq . ( [ hedm - full ] ) is much weaker than the first term and hence , we will consider only the latter in the calculation of edms of paramagnetic atoms .",
    "the non - relativistic limit of this interaction is @xmath49 .",
    "this form of the interaction produces a zero atomic edm @xcite , thus as we show below the edm of a paramagnetic atom due to the intrinsic edm of the electron is entirely a relativistic effect .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to use a relativistic many - body theory to determine its size .",
    "the atomic edm arising from the intrinsic edm of the electron is discussed in detail below .",
    "the total hamiltonian for a many - electron atom , in the absence of any external field , when the electron possesses an intrinsic edm is given by , @xmath50 where , @xmath51 is the atomic hamiltonian given by @xmath52 + \\sum_{i \\ge j } \\frac{1}{r_{ij}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to the electromagnetic interaction and @xmath53 with the internal electric field , @xmath54 $ ] , exerted by the nucleus ( @xmath55 ) and other electrons ( @xmath56 ) .",
