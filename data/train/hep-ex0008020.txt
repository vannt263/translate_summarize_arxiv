    "bose--0.1em einstein  ( be ) interference is observed as an enhanced production of identical bosons , , charged pions , at small four - momentum difference in elementary particle and nuclear collisions @xcite , and , in particular , in hadronic @xmath1  decay  @xcite .",
    "such an interference should also be present in hadronic  decay ( intra--0.1em  be interference ) .",
    "furthermore , since in fully hadronic  events ( @xmath2 ) , the  decay products overlap in space - time , interference between identical bosons originating from different s can be expected  @xcite .",
    "this inter--0.1em  be interference may provide a laboratory to measure the space - time development of this overlap .",
    "moreover , this effect , like colour reconnection  @xcite , can be a source of bias in the determination of the  mass in the four jet channel .",
    "recent model predictions  @xcite , as well as recent experimental results  @xcite , are still contradictory .",
    "the main question we address in this paper is , therefore , whether inter--0.1em  be interference exists .",
    "however , we also examine all be interference , intra--0.1em  as well as inter--0.1em , and make a comparison with that observed in hadronic @xmath1  decays , with and without the contribution of @xmath3 decays .",
    "bose--0.1em einstein  interference manifests itself through correlations between identical bosons at small four - momentum difference .",
    "correlations between two particles are described by the ratio of the two particle number density , @xmath4 , to the product of the two single particle number densities , @xmath5 .",
    "since we are only interested in bose--0.1em einstein  correlations ( bec ) here , the product of single particle densities is replaced by @xmath6 , the two particle density that would occur in the absence of bose--0.1em einstein  interference , resulting in the be correlation function @xmath7 for identical bosons , @xmath8 is related to the space - time particle density through a fourier transformation  @xcite .    since we shall consider only pion pairs , the mass of the particles is fixed and the correlation function is defined in six - dimensional momentum space . since bose--0.1em einstein  correlations are largest at small four - momentum difference , @xmath9 , we parametrize @xmath10 in terms of this single variable . while this is an oversimplification , as recent two- and three - dimensional analyses have shown  @xcite , lack of statistics prevents such multi - dimensional analyses here .",
    "the following method  @xcite is used to study inter--0.1em   bec . if the two s decay independently , the two particle density in fully hadronic  events , @xmath11 , is given by @xmath12 where the superscript ,  or , indicates the  which produced the particles . assuming that the densities for  and  are the same , eq.([eq1a ] )",
    "becomes @xmath13 the terms @xmath14 and @xmath15 of eq.([eq1b ] ) are measured in the fully hadronic  and the semi - hadronic events , respectively .",
    "to measure the product of the single particle densities , we use the two particle density @xmath16 obtained by pairing particles originating from two different semi - hadronic  events ( @xmath17 ) , since by construction these pairs of particles are uncorrelated .    the hypothesis that the two s decay independently can be tested using eq.([eq1b ] ) .",
    "in particular , we write eq.([eq1b ] ) in terms of @xmath18 and use the test statistics @xmath19 and @xmath20 the advantage of this method is that it gives access to the inter--0.1em   correlations directly from the experimental data ; there is no need for normalization by a monte carlo ( @xmath21 ) model .",
    "it is possible that the event mixing procedure introduces artificial distortions and that it does not fully account for some non - be correlations or some detector effects . to diminish the effect of such inadequacies and to be able to compare more directly to other experiments , we also use the double ratio @xmath22 where @xmath23 is derived from a monte carlo sample with no bec , or at least without inter--0.1em  bec .    in the absence of inter--0.1em  correlations , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . to study bec , we examine these relations for small values of @xmath18 , for like - sign particles . to judge the influence of other correlations on these quantities",
    ", we examine them also for unlike - sign particles and in monte carlo models .",
    "the data used in this analysis were collected in 1998 by the l3 detector  @xcite , and correspond to an integrated luminosity of about 177 pb@xmath26 at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath27 .    to obtain the two  event samples , one fully hadronic and the other semi - hadronic , we reconstruct the visible final state fermions , , electrons , muons , @xmath28 jets ( corresponding to the visible @xmath28-decay products ) and the hadronic jets corresponding to quarks , and apply the selection criteria described in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the additional requirement for the fully hadronic channel that the neural network output must be greater than 0.6 . in total , 1032 semi - hadronic events and 1431 fully hadronic events are selected .",
    "the event generator koralw  @xcite is used to simulate the signal processes . within koralw  bec are simulated using the so - called be@xmath29 or be@xmath30 algorithms algorithm used the parameter values parj(92)=1.68 and parj(93)=0.38 , whereas be@xmath31 used parj(92)=1.50 and parj(93)=0.33 .",
    "both have been tuned to the l3 @xmath1  decay data.]@xcite . for most comparisons we will use be@xmath29 , since it agrees better with the data . where be@xmath31 is used",
    "it will be explicitly stated .",
    "the bec are implemented for _ all _ particles , which we refer to as bea , or only for particles coming from the _ same _  ( intra--0.1em  bec ) , which we refer to as bes .",
    "the background processes @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( the last relevant only to the @xmath35  and @xmath35  channels ) are generated using pythia  @xcite with be@xmath31 .",
    "the generated events are passed through the l3 detector simulation program  @xcite , reconstructed and subjected to the same  selection criteria as the data .",
    "mc studies using the above generators show that the selection efficiency for fully hadronic events changes by less than 0.5% when bec ( intra--0.1em , or both intra--0.1em  and inter--0.1em ) are included .",
    "the efficiencies for the channels @xmath36 , ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 are found to be 82.9% , 76.7% , 50.6% and 87.2% , respectively .",
    "the fractions of background for these channels are 4.1% , 4.1% , 12.7% and 18.6% , respectively .",
    "the bec study is based on charged particle information from the central tracker .",
    "charged tracks are required to have at least 35 ( of 62 possible ) hits , and the number of wires from the first to the last hit is required to be at least 45 .",
    "the distance of closest approach ( projected onto the transverse plane ) of a track to the nominal interaction vertex is required to be less than 7.5 mm .",
    "the transverse momentum of a track must be greater than 100 .",
    "after the track selection , there are 287k pairs of like - sign particles in the fully hadronic channel and 55k pairs in the semi - hadronic channel .    with this selection",
    ", reasonable agreement is obtained between the data and the @xmath21  simulation for the distributions of @xmath18 and the difference in azimuthal , as well as polar , angle with respect to the beam , for pairs of like - sign tracks , in both the fully hadronic and the semi - hadronic channels .",
    "this is shown in fig.[figdatsim ] , where the raw data are compared to simulated koralw  with bes and background events .",
    "similar agreement is observed when bea is used .",
    "we first measure the be correlation function , @xmath10 , for like - sign charged pion pairs using two choices of reference sample , , the sample from which @xmath39 is determined .",
    "the first choice uses a monte carlo model without bec : @xmath40 the second choice uses unlike - sign particle pairs from the experimental events .",
    "a major drawback of this method is that the correlation function is affected by the presence of dynamical correlations , such as the decay of resonances . to compensate for this",
    ", the density for unlike - sign pairs is multiplied by the ratio of the densities for like- and unlike - sign pairs determined from a monte carlo model without bec : @xmath41_{{\\ensuremath{{\\mathrm{mc}}}},\\,\\nobe } \\quad.\\ ] ]    in both cases we need to correct the correlation function , @xmath10 , for detector resolution , acceptance , efficiency and for particle misidentification . for this",
    "we use a multiplicative factor derived from monte carlo studies .",
    "since we do not perform explicit hadron identification , this factor is given by the ratio of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , found from monte carlo , for _ pions _ at generator level to that found using _ all particles _ after full detector simulation , reconstruction and selection .",
    "thus , using eqs.([refer0 ] ) and ( [ refer1 ] ) leads , respectively , to @xmath44 \\cdot          \\left[\\frac{\\rho_2(\\pm,\\pm)_{\\gen}}{\\rho_2(\\pm,\\pm)_{\\det}}\\right]_{{\\ensuremath{{\\mathrm{mc}}}}}\\ ] ] and @xmath45_{\\data } \\cdot           \\left[\\frac{\\rho_2(+,-)}{\\rho_2(\\pm,\\pm)}\\right]_{{\\ensuremath{{\\mathrm{mc}}}},\\,\\nobe } \\cdot           \\left[\\frac{\\rho_2(\\pm,\\pm)_{\\gen}}{\\rho_2(\\pm,\\pm)_{\\det } }   \\cdot                 \\frac{\\rho_2(+,-)_{\\det}}{\\rho_2(+,-)_{\\gen}}\\right]_{{\\ensuremath{{\\mathrm{mc } } } } }        \\quad.\\ ] ]    background is taken into account by replacing @xmath46 in the above equations by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the purity of the selection , @xmath49 is the number of pairs of tracks in the @xmath50 data events , and @xmath51 is the number of pairs of tracks corresponding to @xmath52 background events . the background is estimated using monte carlo . in determining @xmath10 using eq.([funct0 ] ) , we use koralw  without bec as the reference sample . for the detector correction , bes with the be@xmath29 algorithm is used for both eqs.([funct0 ] ) and ( [ funct1 ] ) .",
    "fig.[figr2 ] shows the correlation function , eq.([funct0 ] ) , for the fully hadronic and for the semi - hadronic  events .",
    "we parametrize the bose--0.1em einstein  enhancement at low @xmath18 values by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an overall normalization factor , the term @xmath55 takes into account possible long - range momentum correlations , @xmath56 measures the strength of the be correlations and @xmath57 is related to the source size in space - time .",
    "the results of the fits of eq.([fitg ] ) are also shown in fig.[figr2 ] .",
    "the fit results for both choices of reference sample , eqs .  ( [ refer0 ] ) and ( [ refer1 ] ) , are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the statistical error includes bin - to - bin correlations .",
    "these are estimated from 100 sets of  bes events generated by pythia , each with the same statistics as the data .",
    "the variation of @xmath54 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 from their average values was determined for the fully- and semi - hadronic  events .",
    "the ratio of the gaussian width to the average fit error was found to be between 1.01 and 1.61 .",
    "for each parameter , the corresponding ratio is used to scale the original statistical error .",
    "mc studies show that this ratio hardly depends on @xmath18 , which justifies this method to correct for bin - to - bin correlations .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is computed by varying the track and event selections .",
    "both stronger and weaker cuts are applied to the tracks , slightly different event selections are made , and the background fractions are varied .",
    "the influence of the choice of the monte carlo used for the reference sample and for the correction factor is also taken into account .",
    "part of the systematic uncertainty comes from the choice of the fit range .",
    "the large systematic uncertainty on @xmath56 in the fully hadronic channel is mainly due to the difference of including or not including inter--0.1em  bec in the @xmath21  for the correction factor .",
    "using inter--0.1em  bec in the correction factor increases the measured value of  @xmath56 .",
    "bec are observed ( @xmath59 ) in both fully hadronic and semi - hadronic  events .",
    "the values of @xmath56 are higher for the semi - hadronic than for the fully hadronic channel , but the difference is only about two standard deviations ( statistical error only ) for each choice of reference sample . if true , this effect would indicate a suppression of inter--0.1em  bec @xcite , which we study in detail in the following section .    since ,",
    "apart from the quark flavour , hadronic  and @xmath1  decays are expected to be similar , we also analyze a high statistics hadronic @xmath1  decay sample , collected by the l3 detector in 1994 at @xmath60 .",
    "since b quarks are greatly suppressed in  decays , a @xmath61-tagging procedure  @xcite is used to reduce the @xmath61@xmath62  fraction in @xmath1  decays , from 22% to 3% .",
    "the be correlation function , eq.([funct0 ] ) , of the resulting 180k @xmath1  events is plotted in fig.[figr2]b as a full histogram .",
    "as expected , good agreement is observed between this histogram and the correlation function of the semi - hadronic  events .",
    "when b quark decays of the @xmath1  are not removed from the sample , a depletion of the correlation function at small @xmath18 is observed and a clear discrepancy exists with the  data , as the dashed histogram in fig.[figr2]b shows .",
    "to compute the test statistics , eqs .",
    "( [ del ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , we need to construct the two particle density @xmath63 .",
    "this is done by combining pairs of semi - hadronic events having oppositely charged hadronically decaying s .",
    "particles identified as decay products of the leptonically decaying s are discarded .",
    "then the particles from one of the events are rotated so that the s are approximately back - to - back .",
    "since real fully hadronic  events have a small longitudinal energy imbalance that we ascribe to initial state radiation and since experimental resolution leads to both transverse and longitudinal energy imbalance , we do not force the s to be exactly back - to - back .",
    "we introduce an extra momentum , @xmath64 , gaussian distributed in all three components and impose @xmath65 , where @xmath66 are the momenta of the two w s . for the longitudinal component the gaussian has mean 0 and standard deviation 7.9 , while for the transverse components the mean is randomly chosen as @xmath67  and the standard deviation is 1.4 .",
    "these values were chosen to obtain reasonable agreement between the energy imbalance distributions of fully hadronic and mixed events .",
    "in addition , we impose the following cuts which are related to the pre - selection of fully hadronic  events  @xcite .",
    "we demand that the sphericity be larger than 0.045 , that the total visible energy be larger than @xmath68 , that the number of particles identified with the calorimeter ( the cluster multiplicity ) be larger than 30 , that the ratio of the total longitudinal energy imbalance to the visible energy be smaller than 0.25 , and that the @xmath69 value at which the event changes from a 3- to a 4-jet topology , @xmath70 , be larger than 0.001 . after forcing the event into 2 jets with the durham clustering algorithm @xcite",
    ", the average of the jet masses is required to be larger than 30 . after forcing the event into 4 jets with the durham clustering algorithm , we assign two pairs of jets to each of the two w s by first rejecting the combination with the smallest dijet mass and then accepting the combination with the smallest difference between the two dijet masses ( best pairing ) .",
    "we then demand that the difference between the two  masses be less than 70 , that the smallest angle between any two jets be larger than 0.28 radians , and that the average of the two smallest angles between two jets from different s be larger than 0.6 radians .",
    "these cuts reject only approximately 1% of the events and do not change the @xmath18-distribution .",
    "the final selection of fully hadronic events uses a cut at 0.6 on the output of a neural network  @xcite .",
    "this cut is also applied to the mixed events , rejecting 7% .",
    "we have checked the mixing procedure by comparing the distributions and quantities of a large number of variables between mixed events and fully hadronic  events , including event shape variables , track and cluster multiplicities , and variables related to the w such as mass , energy and orientation . in general , good agreement is found .",
    "typical examples are shown in fig.[fig3_0 ] .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] shows the distributions of the three terms in the right - hand side of eq.([del ] ) for the data , not corrected for detector effects , but after background subtraction . at low values of @xmath18",
    "we observe more pairs of unlike - sign particles than pairs of like - sign particles , both in the two - particle densities for fully hadronic ( fig.[fig3]a ) and semi - hadronic ( fig.[fig3]b ) events .",
    "furthermore , we observe that @xmath71 and @xmath72 coincide ( fig.[fig3]c ) .    from these distributions , we compute @xmath73 for like - sign and unlike - sign particle pairs , eq.([del ] ) .",
    "the resulting raw data distributions are shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "also shown are the predictions of koralw  after full detector simulation , reconstruction and selection . both the bea and bes scenarios are shown .",
    "the bea scenario using be@xmath29 shows an enhancement in the @xmath73 distribution for like - sign pairs ( fig.[fig4]a ) , but also a small enhancement for unlike - sign pairs ( fig.[fig4]b ) . the effect for unlike - sign pairs is larger if be@xmath30 is used .",
    "these implementations of bec clearly affect both the like- and unlike - sign particle spectra . from fig.[fig4]a",
    "it is clear that only the bes scenario describes the @xmath74 distribution , while the bea scenario is disfavoured .",
    "in particular , considering @xmath18-values up to 0.6 , the confidence level ( cl ) for the bes and bea scenarios are , respectively , 84% and 0.8% .",
    "the calculations of the confidence levels are based on statistical errors including bin - to - bin correlations .    in fig.[fig5 ]",
    "we show the distributions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 for like - sign and unlike - sign particle pairs , eqs.([eq3 ] ) and  ( [ eq4 ] ) , for the raw data . for the double ratio @xmath76 we use the bes scenario of koralw  as the reference sample . also shown in the figure",
    "are the predictions of koralw   for the scenarios bea and bes .",
    "again , it is clear that the bes scenario of koralw  describes the data , cl=87% for both @xmath77 and @xmath78 , while the bea scenario is disfavoured , cl=0.5% for both @xmath77 and @xmath78 . when be@xmath30 is used instead of be@xmath29 , the bea scenario is even more strongly disfavoured : cl=0.08% for both @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "note that the @xmath76 distributions are by definition equal to unity ( apart from statistical fluctuations ) when koralw  without inter--0.1em  bec is used .",
    "note also that @xmath75 is already close to unity for bes , so that the difference between @xmath75 and @xmath76 is small , which supports the validity of the mixing procedure .    to estimate the strength of inter--0.1em  bec ,",
    "the @xmath78 distribution is fitted ( from 0 to 1.4 ) by the following function @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the fit parameters .",
    "the result of the fit for the strength of inter--0.1em  bec is @xmath83 where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the statistical error has been multiplied by 1.49 to account for bin - to - bin correlations , in the same way as described in the previous section .",
    "this value of @xmath81 is consistent with zero , , with no inter--0.1em  bec .",
    "a similar fit was performed for the koralw  bea distribution , resulting in @xmath84 ( statistical error only ) .",
    "the data disagree with this value by more than 4 standard deviations .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on  @xmath81 is the sum in quadrature of the contributions listed in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the amount of background was varied by @xmath85 .",
    "the choice of monte carlo was varied using pythia  and koralw , both with no bec at all as well as with only intra--0.1em  bec .",
    "also the effect of various models of colour reconnection @xcite and gh @xcite models , as implemented in pythia , were used . ]",
    "( cr ) was included . a change in the fit range ( @xmath86 ) ,",
    "a change in the bin size ( from 40 to 80 ) and a change in the parametrization ( removing the factor @xmath87 from the fit ) also give contributions to the systematic uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , the track and event selections were varied .",
    "in the mixing procedure we allow a semi - hadronic event to be combined with all possible other semi - hadronic  events . to be sure that this does not introduce a bias ,",
    "the analysis was repeated for a mixed sample where every semi - hadronic event was used only once .",
    "the influence of the mixing procedure was also studied by not only combining oppositely charged s , but also like - sign s .",
    "the influence of the extra momentum @xmath64 , used in the event mixing , is also included as a systematic effect .",
    "the rms of the systematic uncertainties due to these three changes in the mixing procedure is the systematic uncertainty listed in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the influence of the cut on the neural network output for the mixed events was investigated by removing the cut .",
    "furthermore , the effect of uncertainties in the energy calibration of the calorimeters was studied .",
    "finally , we studied the influence of the @xmath35  channel .",
    "since this channel is the most difficult to identify , and therefore has relatively high background and low efficiency , we repeated the analysis without it .    to make the analysis possibly more sensitive to inter--0.1em  bec",
    ", we repeated the analysis twice using different selections to increase the overlap of the  and  decay products .",
    "since bec occur mainly among soft particles and the overlap is expected to be larger for these particles than for high - momentum ones , we first repeated the analysis using only tracks with momenta smaller than 1.5 . another way to increase",
    "the overlap is to require that jets from different s be close together .",
    "we therefore repeated the analysis requiring that the average of the smallest two of the four angles between jets from different s be less than @xmath88 .",
    "this results in a reduction of approximately 60% in the number of fully hadronic  events .",
    "fig.[fig6 ] shows the distributions of @xmath78 for these two analyses .",
    "it is again clear that the bea scenario is disfavoured , particularly for the low - momentum selection , while bes describes the data well . for the low - momentum sample",
    "we find cl=1.6% for bea and cl=96% for bes , and for the sample with the angular cut we find cl= 10% for bea and cl=93% for bes .",
    "moreover , we find @xmath89 for the low - momentum sample and @xmath90 for the sample with the angular cut . both values are consistent with zero .",
    "the errors here are statistical only , including bin - to - bin correlations .",
    "intra--0.1em bose--0.1em einstein  correlations have been found to be similar to those observed in @xmath1  decay to light quarks .",
    "an excess at small values of @xmath18 in the distributions of @xmath74 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 is expected from inter--0.1em  bec , but none is seen .",
    "these distributions agree well with koralw  using be@xmath29 when inter--0.1em  bec are not included , but not when they are .",
    "we thus find no evidence for bec between identical pions originating from different s and disfavour their implementation using the be@xmath29 and be@xmath30 algorithms .",
