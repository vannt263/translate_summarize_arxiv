    "the model is a mean  field description of such a situation where the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the densities of the substances @xmath0 and @xmath29 for more details see @xcite .    equations ( [ system1 ] ) and ( [ system2 ] ) are best studied in terms of the sum @xmath30 and the difference @xmath31 which satisfy the equations @xmath32 with initial conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( at time @xmath35 that satisfy @xmath36 and @xmath37 for initial conditions @xmath38 @xmath15 with @xmath39 the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are even and odd , respectively , and the equations ( [ equ ] ) , ( [ eqv ] ) preserve this symmetry . furthermore , for the special initial condition",
    "@xmath40 with @xmath41 defined by the equation @xmath42 equation ( [ equ ] ) has the explicit solution @xmath43 we note that the initial condition ( [ initsym ] ) for @xmath44 ( at time @xmath45 ) is simply the solution of equation ( [ equ ] ) with the `` natural '' initial condition , @xmath46 for @xmath18 @xmath47 for @xmath20 evaluated at @xmath48 to keep this paper as simple as possible we now restrict the discussion to this case , i.e. , we consider from now on equation ( [ eqv ] ) with initial conditions satisfying ( [ limitv ] ) , and @xmath44 given by ( [ uxt ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that more general ( asymmetric ) initial conditions for @xmath44 could be treated as well .",
    "this would lead to corrections to @xmath44 of the order @xmath49 and such corrections do not change in any way the discussion of the equation for @xmath50 that follows .",
    "the reaction  diffusion problems considered here develop , in addition to the built  in diffusive length scale @xmath51 an additional shorter length scale , on which the reaction takes place .",
    "the function @xmath52@xmath53 is called the reaction term or reaction front , and we are interested in describing the asymptotic behavior of the function @xmath54 for large times .",
    "the knowledge of this behavior is useful , since it appears to be universal , in the sense that it is largely independent of the choice of the initial conditions and of the details of the model under consideration . as mentioned above , if @xmath33 is an even function , then @xmath50 and as a consequence @xmath54 are even functions of @xmath55 we will see that the critical point of @xmath54 at @xmath56 is a maximum , and that @xmath54 decays ( rapidly ) for large @xmath55    before proceeding any further we note that the factor of @xmath57 in ( [ system1 ] ) , ( [ system2 ] ) and ( [ reaction001 ] ) is just a normalization , and has been chosen for convenience to make the equation ( [ eqv ] ) for @xmath50 look simple .",
    "in fact , any system of the form @xmath58 with positive @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 and with initial conditions such that @xmath63 can be reduced , by scaling space and time and the amplitudes , to the problem    @xmath64    with @xmath65 and with initial conditions such that @xmath66 in this paper we have limited the discussion to the case @xmath67 and @xmath68 the case @xmath69 leads to a moving reaction front .",
    "a change of coordinates to a moving frame complicates the analysis , but the problem could still be treated with the methods presented here .",
    "choosing @xmath70 makes the equations mathematically simpler . as a consequence , as we have seen",
    ", the two equations for @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be reduced to just one equation for the sum @xmath71 since the equation for the difference @xmath72 can be solved explicitly . even though we do not expect the asymptotic behavior of the solution to change in any relevant way if @xmath73 , the strategy of proof would have to be changed considerably , since the equations can not be decoupled anymore in that case .",
    "before we state our results , we briefly discuss the expected dependence of the results on the parameter @xmath74    the case @xmath3 has been studied in detail in @xcite , where it is proved that in this case the reaction term ( [ reaction001 ] ) satisfies , for all @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 and where @xmath79 is a smooth function that decays like @xmath80 for large values of @xmath81 it follows furthermore from the results in @xcite that the function @xmath54 is very small on the diffusive scale in the sense that for @xmath82 @xmath83 and all @xmath84@xmath85 the smallness of @xmath54 on the diffusive scale is easily understood by realizing that , for @xmath3 and for positive values of @xmath86 on the diffusive scale , i.e. , for @xmath87 equation ( [ system1 ] ) essentially reduces to @xmath88 with @xmath89 therefore , the function @xmath27 decays exponentially fast to zero on this scale , and similarly for @xmath28 for negative values of @xmath55    for @xmath90 however , equation ( [ system1 ] ) reduces , for @xmath87 essentially to @xmath91 with @xmath89 the solution of ( [ a002 ] ) has an asymptotic behavior that is radically different from the solution of ( [ a001 ] ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath92 , the solution may even blow up in finite time if @xmath27 is not a positive function . note that , for @xmath93 odd , the nonlinear term in ( [ a002 ] ) is always a `` friction term '' , independent of the sign of @xmath94 and the case of @xmath93 odd will therefore turn out to be easier to treat than the case of @xmath93 even .",
    "it is well known @xcite that for @xmath95 and small bounded integrable initial conditions , the nonlinearity in ( [ a002 ] ) becomes irrelevant for large times in the sense that the solution converges to a multiple of @xmath96 which solves the linear equation @xmath97 we would therefore expect that , for @xmath4 the function @xmath54 is of the order @xmath98 on the diffusive scale .",
    "this turns out to be wrong . as we will prove below",
    ", @xmath54 is of the order @xmath99 for @xmath4 because @xmath54 converges on this scale pointwise to a function that is not integrable at the origin .",
    "this corresponds to a solution of ( [ a002 ] ) for which the nonlinear term is a marginal perturbation , i.e. , a solution with an amplitude of the order @xmath100 .",
    "we will see that one can take advantage of this fact , and a diffusive stability bound will be good enough to prove convergence of @xmath54 to its limit , but as a consequence , our results will be limited to the case @xmath101 the cases @xmath92 and @xmath102 are special and will not be discussed any further .",
    "the following theorem is our main result .",
    "[ main]for arbitrary but fixed @xmath5 @xmath103 there exist @xmath104 functions @xmath105",

    "as we will see , for @xmath103 it will not be necessary to impose that @xmath124 and @xmath15 be positive everywhere , and it will neither be necessary to impose that @xmath125 be an even function .    as we will see",

    "we get a precise description of the reaction front @xmath54 on the reactive and the diffusive scale .",

    "this strategy is implemented in section 5 and section 6 .",
    "the appendix contains the proof of the existence of the functions @xmath145 @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",

    "we will show that if @xmath147 is defined correctly , @xmath156 large enough and @xmath157 small enough , then @xmath153 can be chosen positive and @xmath155 will be small , so that the solution of equation ( [ eqpsi ] ) will be bounded for large times by the corresponding solution of the inhomogeneous heat equation @xmath158 we will find that , with the right choice of @xmath159@xmath160 from which the bound ( [ bound ] ) will follow .",
    "we note that @xmath161 for @xmath162 so that contributions of initial conditions will become irrelevant for large times , i.e. , the solution @xmath151 becomes what is called `` slaved to the inhomogeneous term '' .",
    "in order to implement the strategy outlined in section 2 , we need a function @xmath163 that approximates the solution @xmath50 for large times sufficiently well , uniformly in @xmath55 since we would like to control the time evolution of equation ( [ eqpsi ] ) on @xmath164 this function @xmath163 needs to satisfy @xmath165 in order for @xmath50 to satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ limitv ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the inhomogeneous term @xmath166 in equation ( [ eqpsi ] ) contains second derivatives of @xmath167 and the function @xmath166 can therefore only be in @xmath168 if @xmath163 is at least twice differentiable .",
    "we now construct a function @xmath163 satisfying these requirements through a two length  scale asymptotic expansion .    to simplify the notation later on we use the convention that , unless stated otherwise , @xmath169 and @xmath170 and we will refer to @xmath171 as the diffusive length scale and to @xmath172 as the reactive length scale .    the function @xmath147 is given by the first and second order terms of a so called `` matched asymptotic expansion '' .",
    "the `` matched '' refers to the fact that such an expansion contains functions that can not be associated uniquely with one of the length scales and can therefore be used to `` match '' the behavior at large distances of the shorter scale with the behavior at short distances of the larger scale .",

    "we find that @xmath914 , and we conclude that @xmath915 therefore , @xmath916 and @xmath917 if @xmath891 is small enough . therefore , since @xmath918 for all @xmath919 we find that @xmath920 and therefore @xmath921 for some @xmath922 as claimed .",
    "next , let @xmath923 be an initial condition with @xmath924 with @xmath925 to be chosen below .",
    "we now show that such an initial condition is in @xmath771 for all @xmath926 we have the lower bounds @xmath927 and @xmath928 @xmath929 where @xmath930 @xmath931 and @xmath932 and for @xmath933 we therefore have the lower bound @xmath934 and it follows , using again the integral equation ( [ inteq ] ) , that @xmath935 diverges at ( or before ) infinity , that therefore @xmath936 for some @xmath937 which implies that @xmath938 provided @xmath939 for @xmath940 small enough and for @xmath93 large enough ( [ cond ] ) can be verified without too much difficulty . with the help of a computer one can show that ( [ cond ] ) is satisfied for the remaining @xmath941 for @xmath251 ( [ cond ] ) is not satisfied , since the above bounds on @xmath942 and @xmath943 are too weak . sufficiently good bounds can be obtained by dividing the interval @xmath944 in two pieces and by integrating lower bounds on each of the subintervals .",
    "we omit the details .",
    "finally , uniqueness of @xmath945 can be proved by integrating the difference of two solutions from @xmath946 to infinity , which , using the positivity of @xmath947 leads to a contradiction with the fact that both of the solutions converge to zero at infinity .",
    "the equation ( [ h ] ) for @xmath280 is linear .",
    "we therefore first construct two linearly independent solutions @xmath948 and @xmath949 for the corresponding homogeneous equation , which we then use to construct , using standard methods , a solution of ( [ h ] ) that satisfies the boundary conditions ( [ bh-1 ] ) and ( [ bh-2 ] ) .",
    "the homogeneous equation is @xmath950 where @xmath951 since the equation ( [ homh ] ) is linear , the integral equation for @xmath948 , @xmath952 has a positive solution that exists for all @xmath86 in @xmath211 by definition , we have near @xmath56 the behavior @xmath953 at infinity , the solution @xmath948 is asymptotic to a solution of the equation @xmath954 this equation is the same as the homogeneous part of equation ( [ eqs ] ) , and the leading order behavior of @xmath948 at infinity is therefore either proportional to @xmath955 or to @xmath956 with @xmath957 as defined in ( [ eqn : critexp ] ) . since @xmath948 is positive , we find using ( [ eqh1 ] ) , that @xmath958 for all @xmath86 in @xmath325 and therefore @xmath948 is near infinity of the form @xmath959 for some constant @xmath960 .",
    "a second solution of the homogeneous equation ( [ homh ] ) is @xmath961 near @xmath56 we have that @xmath962 and near infinity we find that @xmath963 where @xmath964 , and @xmath965 @xmath966 we note that @xmath967 therefore , the function @xmath968 , @xmath969 where @xmath970 and where @xmath971 satisfies equation ( [ h ] ) . near zero , the function @xmath628 is of the form @xmath972 , and therefore , using the behavior of @xmath948 and @xmath949 near zero , we find that @xmath973 is near zero of order @xmath974 , and @xmath845 is near zero of order @xmath975 the function @xmath968 is therefore of order @xmath976 near zero . at infinity ,",
    "the function @xmath628 is of the form @xmath977 where @xmath978 and therefore the function @xmath845 is near infinity of the form @xmath979 , and @xmath973 is near infinity of the form @xmath980 , for some constant @xmath981 using these asymptotic behavior for @xmath973 , @xmath948 , @xmath845 , and @xmath290 we find for the function @xmath982 near infinity the behavior , @xmath983 in the last equality we have used the definition ( [ lambda0 ] ) for @xmath984 the function @xmath985@xmath986 solves the equation ( [ h ] ) , satisfies the boundary condition ( [ bh-1 ] ) , and since , as we show in the next section , the higher order terms in ( [ hpinfty ] ) converge to zero at infinity , it also satisfies the boundary condition ( [ bh-2 ] ) .      by construction ,",
    "the leading behavior of @xmath280 at infinity is @xmath987 .",
    "we therefore make the ansatz @xmath988 , and to leading order , we get for the function @xmath191 the linear equation @xmath989 for a certain constant @xmath990 .",
    "the general solution of equation ( [ bvarphi2 - 2 ] ) is @xmath991 with a certain constant @xmath992 and with @xmath819 , @xmath993 as defined in ( [ eqn : critexp ] ) .",
    "since @xmath994 but @xmath995 the coefficient of the term proportional to @xmath996 must be zero .",
    "therefore , since@xmath997 for all @xmath998 the asymptotic behavior of @xmath999 is always given by @xmath1000 we omit the details of the proof that this is indeed the correct second order behavior of @xmath191 at infinity .",
