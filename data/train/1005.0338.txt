    "the transfer of ly@xmath0 radiation in optically thick medium is fundamentally important for the understanding of the physics of halos around ly@xmath0 photon sources or clouds nearby these sources .",
    "it includes ly@xmath0 forest , damped ly@xmath0 system , ly@xmath0 blob , ly@xmath0 emitter and fluorescent ly@xmath0 emission of galaxies and quasars , as well as the optical afterglow of gamma ray bursts .",
    "the profiles of the emission and absorption of the ly@xmath0 radiation from these sources are powerful tools to constrain the mass density , velocity , temperature and the fraction of neutral hydrogen of igm at various redshifts ( miralda - escude & rees 1998 ; miralda - escude 1998 ; haiman & cen 2005 ; tasitsiomi 2006 ; totani et al . 2006 ; mcquinn et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "it is well known that the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons with neutral hydrogen atoms has a profound effect on the time , space and frequency dependencies of the transfer of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "an analytical solution of the integro - differential equation of the resonant radiative transfer revealed that the resonant scattering leads to a local boltzmann distribution of photons in a small frequency range around the ly@xmath0 frequency @xmath1 ( wouthuysen 1952 ; field 1958 , 1959 ) .",
    "the temperature of the boltzmann distribution is equal to the kinetic temperature of the neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "the width of the local boltzmann distribution is increasing with time .",
    "this is the so - called wouthuysen - field effect , which is important in @xmath5 cm cosmology ( fang 2009 ) .    besides field",
    "s solution , no other time - dependent analytical solutions of the integro - differential equation are available .",
    "all other analytical solutions ( harrington 1973 ; neufeld 1990 ; dijkstra et al",
    ". 2006 ) are based on the time - independent fokker - planck equation , which is the diffusion approximation of the radiation transfer .",
    "these time - independent solutions are important , but can only be used to describe the  limiting asymptotic behavior \" of the radiative transfer ( adams 1972 ) .",
    "it gives nothing of the time - development of the local boltzmann distribution .",
    "the monte carlo numerical method has also been used to solve the radiative transfer of ly@xmath0 photons ( lee 1974 , zheng & miralda - escude 2002 ; ahn 2002 ; cantalupo et al . 2005 ; verhamme et al .",
    "yet , the time - development of the wouthuysen - field effect is also absent in this approach",
    ".    time - independent approximation would be reasonable if the length scale @xmath6 and time scales @xmath7 of the problem considered satisfy the condition @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", one can take @xmath9 , and then , the time derivative term @xmath10 of the radiative transfer equation can be dropped .",
    "the condition @xmath8 , however , can not be satisfied if the size of the neutral hydrogen halo is large and the time scale of the ly@xmath0 photon source is small .",
    "for instance , the time scale @xmath11 of the optical afterglow of grbs is of the order of a few tens of hours ( e.g. tanvir et al .",
    "2009 ; salvaterra et al .",
    "2009 ) , or a few days ( vreeswijk et al . 2004 ) , while the column number density of neutral hydrogen is as large as 10@xmath12 @xmath13 , and number volume density is about 10@xmath14 -10@xmath15 @xmath16 ( vreeswijk et al .",
    "therefore , the size of the neutral hydrogen halos should be much larger than @xmath17 .",
    "it is improper to treat the short - time problems with the solutions of  limiting asymptotic behavior \" .",
    "recently , a state - of - the - art numerical solver for the kinetic equations has been developed .",
    "this solver is based on the weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) scheme ( jiang & shu 1996 ) .",
    "it has been developed to solve the boltzmann equations ( carrillo et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) and radiative transfer ( qiu et al . 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "this numerical solver has successfully passed the tests of conservation of photon number , field s solutions and the wouthuysen - field effect etc . , and has been properly used as the solver of the transfer of resonant photons ( roy et al . 2009a , b , c ) .",
    "we will study , in this paper , the time - dependent behavior of the ly@xmath0 radiation transfer in an optically thick medium .",
    "we will not try to explain any specific observed ly@xmath0 spectrum , instead we will study the physical features of the resonant photon transfer , which can not be addressed with previous solvers . for instance , we will show that the frequency distribution of the ly@xmath0 photons can keep in a locally thermalized state even when the intensity and flux are highly time - dependent .",
    "this feature is essentially important , as thermalization generally will lead to the initial conditions being forgotten .",
    "our solver is also able to study the transfer of a light flash in optically thick halo .",
    "it shows that the nature of the transfer is a diffusion process , though it is not a purely brownian diffusion .",
    "this property leads to the trap and store of photons thermalized around the ly@xmath0 frequency for a long time after the cease of the central source emission .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the theoretical background of the ly@xmath0 photon transfer in an optically thick medium .",
    "section 3 gives the solution of ly@xmath0 photons emergent from an optically thick spherical halos with a steady source located at the center of the halo .",
    "section 4 is on the solutions when the central source is a flash .",
    "a discussion and conclusion are given in section 5 .",
    "the details of the numerical implementation is given in the appendix .",
    "the property of the halo around individual luminous object depends on the luminosity , the spectrum of uv photon emission , and the time - evolution of the center object . for luminous objects at high redshift",
    ", the halos generally consist of three spheres ( cen 2006 ; liu et al .",
    "the most inner region is the highly ionized strmgren sphere , or the hii region , which is optically thin of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "the second region , which is just outside the hii region , is optically thick of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "the temperature of the baryon gas is about @xmath18 k , which is due to the heating of the uv photons .",
    "the third region is outside of the heated region .",
    "it is un - heated , and therefore , the temperature of the baryon gas can be as low as @xmath19 k.    in this context , we will study the transfer of ly@xmath0 photons in a radius @xmath20 spherical halo of neutral hydrogen with temperature @xmath21 in the range of @xmath19 to @xmath22 k. assuming the uniformly distributed hi gas has number density @xmath23 , the optical depth over a light path @xmath24 is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the cross section of the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0 photons by hydrogen , given as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dimensionless frequency defined by @xmath29 , @xmath1 being the resonant frequency .",

    "therefore , @xmath28 measures the frequency deviation @xmath32 in units of @xmath33 hz . @xmath34 @xmath35 is the cross section of the resonant scattering at the frequency @xmath36 s@xmath37 .",
    "the function @xmath38 in equation ( 1 ) is the normalized profile given by the voigt function as ( hummer 1965 ) @xmath39 the parameter @xmath40 in equation ( 2 ) is the ratio of the natural to the doppler broadening . for the ly@xmath0 line , @xmath41 .",
    "the optical depth of the halo with column number density of neutral hydrogen @xmath42 is @xmath43 since @xmath44 when @xmath45 , the line - center optical depth is then @xmath46 , and @xmath47      the radiative transfer of ly@xmath0 photons in spherical halo is described by the equation of the specific intensity @xmath48 as @xmath49 where we use dimensionless time @xmath50 defined as @xmath51 and dimensionless coordinate @xmath52 defined as @xmath53 , with @xmath54 being the physical radial coordinate .",

    "the re - distribution function @xmath58 gives the probability of a photon absorbed at the frequency @xmath59 , and re - emitted at the frequency @xmath28 .",
    "it depends on the details of the scattering ( henyey 1941 ; hummer 1962 ; hummer 1969 ) .",

    ", the total number of photons is conserved in the evolution described by equation ( 5 ) .",
    "that is , the destruction processes of ly@xmath0 photons , such as the two - photon process ( spitzer & greenstein 1951 ; osterbrock 1962 ) , is ignored in equation ( 5 ) . in equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , we also do not consider the recoil of atoms .",
    "it is equal to assume the mass of atom is very large .",
    "the effect of recoil actually is under control ( roy et al",
    ". we will address it in next section .    in equation",
    "( 5 ) , the term with the parameter @xmath66 is due to the expansion of the universe . if @xmath67 is equal to the mean of the number density of cosmic hydrogen , we have @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the gunn - peterson optical depth . since gunn - peterson optical depth is of the order of @xmath70 at high redshift ( e.g. roy et al .",
    "2009c ) , we will take the parameter @xmath71 .",
    "when the optical depth is large , we can take the eddington approximation as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the angularly averaged specific intensity and @xmath74 is the flux . defining @xmath75 and @xmath76 ,",
    "eq.(5 ) yields the equations of @xmath77 and @xmath78 as @xmath79 the mean intensity @xmath80 describes the @xmath28 photons trapped in the halo by the resonant scattering , while the flux @xmath81 describes the photons in transit .",
    "the source term @xmath82 in the equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) can be described by a boundary condition of @xmath77 and @xmath78 at @xmath83 .",
    "we can take @xmath84 , as @xmath85 is not important if the optical depth of the halo is large .",
    "thus , we have @xmath86 where @xmath87 , and @xmath88 are , respectively , the intensity and normalized frequency profile of the sources . since equation ( 9)-(11 )",
    "are linear , the intensity @xmath87 can be taken as any constant .",
    "that is , the solution @xmath89 of @xmath90 is equal to @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the solution of @xmath93 . on the other hand ,",
    "the equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) are not linear with respect to the function @xmath88 , i.e. the solution @xmath89 of @xmath88 is not equal to @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the solution of @xmath96 .    in the range outside the halo , @xmath97 , no photons propagate in the direction @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , the boundary condition at @xmath99 given by @xmath100 is then ( unno 1955 ) @xmath101 there is no photon in the field before @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , the initial condition is @xmath103    we solve equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) with the numerical method developed recently ( roy et al .",

    "some details of this method is given in the appendix .",
    "we first solve the problems when the sources @xmath82 is steady .",
    "first we consider steady sources . that is , the parameter @xmath87 in eq.(11 ) is time - independent after the switch - on of the sources at @xmath104 [ eq.(13 ) ] .",
    "a typical solution of the flux @xmath105 given by equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) is shown in figure 1 , for which the source is taken to be @xmath106 and @xmath107 , i.e. the emission line width is equal to the doppler broadening .",

    "if the ly@xmath0 photon transfer is due only to spatial diffusion , the time scale of a spatial transfer with an optical depth @xmath125 should be as large as @xmath126 .",
    "however , figure 1 shows that photons have already escaped from the @xmath125 hole within the time @xmath127 , which is much less than the time scale of a purely brownian diffusion .",
    "therefore , the transfer of photons should not be a process of purely brownian diffusion .",
    "this point is very well known in early studies on the escape of resonant photon from opaque clouds ( osterbrock 1962 ; harrington 1973 ; avery & house 1968 ) .",
    "the time scale of escape shown in figure 1 is also consistent with the estimation given by monte carlo simulations ( adams , 1975 ; bonilha et al .",
    "1979 ) . however , these works are mainly based on the time scale of the escape of photons with frequency , at which the photon can take a  single longest excursion \" ( adams 1972 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that the escape time scale @xmath128 is available not only for photons which can take a  single longest excursion \" , but also for all photons with frequency around @xmath1 or @xmath129 .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 also plays the role of testing our algorithm . because @xmath130 , eq.(9 ) yields @xmath131 when the solution approached the stable state .",
    "equation ( 14 ) is the conservation of photon number .",
    "since numerical errors which have accumulated over a long time evolution could be huge , eq.(14 ) is useful to check the reliability of the code .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 shows perfectly @xmath132 at stable state .",
    "figure 2 shows a solution of the mean intensity @xmath80 of equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) at @xmath112 and time @xmath133 , 300 , 500 .",

    "the source is @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath66 are taken to be @xmath119 and @xmath120 . ]",
    "a remarkable feature of the solutions is to show a flat plateau around @xmath129 . as has been shown by roy et al .",
    "( 2009c ) , the flat plateau actually is the boltzmann statistical equilibrium distribution around @xmath129 when the atomic mass is infinite .",
    "if the mass is finite , i.e. considering the recoil in the re - distribution functions ( 6 ) or ( 7 ) , the flat plateau will become @xmath134 , where @xmath135 .",
    "this is the local boltzmann distribution required by the wouthuysen - field effect ( roy et al .",
    "2009b ) .",
    "without resonant scattering , the pure absorption will lead to the flux of @xmath1 photons at @xmath112 to be attenuated by a factor @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , figure 2 shows that a major effect of resonant scattering is to restore @xmath1 photons in optically thick halos . according to the re - distribution function @xmath137 equation ( 5 ) ,",
    "the probability of transferring a @xmath59 photon to a @xmath138 photon is larger than that from @xmath59 to @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , the net effect of resonant scattering is to bring photons with frequency @xmath140 to the central range @xmath141 of frequency space .",
    "photons of @xmath142 are then effectively restored . moreover",
    ", the restored photons are thermalized .",
    "we see from figure 2 that in the time range from @xmath133 to @xmath143 , the mean intensity @xmath77 at @xmath129 quickly increases by a factor larger than @xmath144 . in the same time , the flat plateau or the local thermalization around @xmath129 is perfectly held .",
    "therefore , the time scales @xmath145 of @xmath1 photon restoring and thermalization should be less than @xmath133 , which is much smaller than the time scale @xmath146 of escaping from a halo of @xmath112 .     at @xmath112 and time @xmath133 , 300 and 500 ,",

    "other parameters are the same as in figure 1,title=\"fig : \" ]    the result of @xmath148 in optically thick halos is very important .",
    "one can conclude that the photons of the flux @xmath78 around @xmath129 emergent from an optically thick halos actually come from the thermalized photons , regardless of the initial distribution of the photons .",
    "the initial conditions of the photon source have already been forgotten during the thermalization .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the profile of flux @xmath78 has to be independent of the sources .",
    "we demonstrate this point with figure 3 .",
    "figure 3 presents the flux @xmath78 given by equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) with the same parameters as the solution of figure 1 , and the source profiles are @xmath107 ( left ) and @xmath147 ( right ) .",
    "that is , the line widths are , respectively , 1 and @xmath149 .",
    "we see that the left and right profiles of figure 3 are almost identical within @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , the initial distribution of photon frequency is already forgotten , and the photons of the left and right cases at @xmath151 actually are from the same thermalized sources .",
    "the profiles of the flux are also held if the line width is broader than 1 .",
    "we will show this point when the source has a continuant spectrum (  3.4 ) .",
    "the profiles of either @xmath77 or @xmath78 shown in figures 1 - 3 have two peak structure .",
    "the flux @xmath78 is dominated by photons with frequency @xmath152 .",
    "the two peak structure has been recognized in all the time - independent solutions of the fokker - planck approximation ( harrington 1973 ; neufeld 1990 ; dijkstra et al .",

    "a point we would like to emphasize is that this structure is independent of the profile of the source @xmath82 .",
    "it is because the initial properties of the central sources have been forgotten during the local thermalization .",

    "when the photons of the flux @xmath78 mainly come from the locally thermalized photons , the frequency of the two peaks , @xmath153 , should not be described by the relation @xmath154 , because this relation is from a solution of the time - independent fokker - planck equation , which does not describe the thermalization ( neufeld 1990 ) .     as a function of @xmath155 for the solutions of eqs .",
