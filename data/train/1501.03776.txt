    "examples include outer space tests of general relativity , detection of short - circuit faults in microchips , as well as several applications in medicine , such as measuring regions of brain activity in magneto - encephalography .",
    "however , this high degree of sensitivity also causes the squids to be sensitive to magnetic fluctuations intrinsic to its wires and interfaces .",
    "the most sensitive squids show excess flux noise ( in addition to johnson - nyquist white noise ) of the order of @xmath4 at a frequency of @xmath5  hz [ @xmath6 is the flux quantum ] .",
    "this value has not changed in order of magnitude since the first measurements of flux noise in the 1980 s ; @xcite only minor improvements are observed in modern devices.@xcite while flux noise is sufficiently low for several applications , it is still considered a barrier for the use of the squid as a quantum bit ( the flux qubit ) in a superconductor - based quantum computer architecture.@xcite flux noise induces dephasing and relaxation of flux qubits , limiting their coherence times to less than @xmath7  @xmath8s.@xcite flux noise also degrades performance of other superconducting ( sc ) qubits such as the transmon@xcite and phase qubit.@xcite the effort to reduce flux noise and increase qubit coherence times has been a major source of motivation for research in improving sc devices .     and lateral width @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",

    "interestingly , this value is right in the range of spin diffusion constants measured for lattice nuclear spins due to their mutual dipolar interaction.@xcite the typical metals that form superconducting wires ( e.g. niobium , aluminum ) all have non - zero lattice nuclear spin , that are expected to contribute to intrinsic flux noise up to frequencies of the order of @xmath19  hz ( the value of dipolar coupling between nearest - neighbor nuclei in the crystal lattice).@xcite nuclear spin noise should be present even in hypothetically `` perfect '' devices that contain no electron spin centers .",

    "here we describe a theory for the excess flux detected by sc circuits in the presence of localized magnetic moments , and make explicit numerical predictions for the flux noise power ( noise spectral density integrated over all frequencies ) originating from electron and nuclear spins uniformly distributed in the surface and bulk of the sc wires .",

    "we present simple analytic expressions that allow direct comparisons to flux noise models and experiments .",
    "as we shall demonstrate , flux noise power depends crucially on the vectorial nature of the coupling between sc circuit to spins .",
    "this vectorial nature can be mapped out by measuring flux noise as a function of the direction and magnitude of an external magnetic field applied along the plane of the wires .",
    "previous calculations of flux noise due to localized spin@xcite were based on modelling the spin as a square loop of side @xmath20 m , the minimum feature size allowed by the finite element software fasthenry.@xcite more recently , extensive numerical studies@xcite showed that these calculations greatly underestimated the value of the flux produced by spins located at the wire surfaces , because they did not take account of the singular nature of the spin s dipole field . indeed , analytic expressions for the flux noise power that take into account the spin s singular behaviour are still absent from the literature . below we obtain these expressions and argue that they can be applied to arbitrary circuits made of thin - film wires .",

    "<S> superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) and other superconducting circuits are limited by intrinsic flux noise with spectral density @xmath0 with @xmath1 whose origin is believed to be due to spin impurities . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a theory of flux noise that takes into account the vectorial nature of the coupling of spins to superconducting wires . </S>",
    "<S> we present explicit numerical calculations of the flux noise power ( spectral density integrated over all frequencies ) for electron impurities and lattice nuclear spins under several different assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> the noise power is shown to be dominated by surface electron spins near the wire edges , with bulk lattice nuclear spins contributing @xmath2% of the noise power in aluminum and niobium wires . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the role of electron spin phase transitions , showing that the spin - spin correlation length ( describing e.g. the average size of ferromagnetic spin clusters ) greatly impacts the scaling of flux noise with wire geometry . remarkably , flux noise power is exactly equal to zero when the spins are polarized along the flux vector direction , forming what we call a poloidal state . </S>",
    "<S> flux noise is non - zero for other spin textures , but gets reduced in the presence of correlated ferromagnetic fluctuations between the top and bottom wire surfaces , where the flux vectors are antiparallel . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that engineering spin textures and/or inter - surface correlation provides a method to reduce flux noise in superconducting devices . </S>"
