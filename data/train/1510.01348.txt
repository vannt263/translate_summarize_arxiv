    "quantum manipulation applied to information processing or information storage is actually a continuously growing research area searching for practical , easy and optimal solutions in evolution of quantum systems . for spin based resources , single two level systems on @xmath3",
    "have well known exact and optimal control solutions in terms of energy or time @xcite . despite",
    ", bigger spin systems in general have a complex behavior still not completely known contrasting with those @xmath3 solutions .",
    "spin interactions have been analyzed in terms of transference and control of entanglement in bipartite qubits @xcite , chains and lattices @xcite . on these arrangements ,",
    "several approaches have extended research on more complex systems depending on external parameters ( temperature , strength of external fields , geometry , etc . )",
    "@xcite .",
    "anysotropic ising model for bipartite systems in @xmath6 @xcite lets a @xmath7 block decomposition when their evolution is written in a non - local basis instead of traditional computational basis .",
    "it means @xmath8 becomes a direct sum of two subspaces , each one generated by a pair of bell states . while , @xmath9 becomes in the semi - direct product @xmath7 . in these terms , control can be reduced to two @xmath3 control problems in each block and exact solutions can be found @xcite .",
    "blocks can be configured as a function of the direction of external driven interactions being included .",
    "such scheme lets control transformations between pairs of bell states on demand , therefore on the complete state in spite of the possibility to reconfigure those pairs .",
    "thus , the procedure sets a control method to manipulate quantum information on matter based on bell states as computational grammar instead of traditional computational basis , letting the transformation between any pair of elements of this basis under well known control procedures for @xmath3 .",
    "thus , reduction or decomposition schemes from large systems in terms of simpler problems based on isolated two level subsystems could to state easier and universal ( but not globally optimal in general ) control procedures to manipulate them .",
    "complexity of multiqubit systems grows unpredictably with their size in terms of entanglement properties , usefulness and control . in particular , their manipulation do not exhibit scalable rules departing from their smallest systems on which they are constituted .",
    "recently , a series of works considering driven magnetic fields together with bipartite ising interaction show the evolution matrix expressed in a non - local basis splits the dynamics on two weak related information subsystems .",
    "the splitting could be selected as function of field direction . in this sense ,",
    "current work shows the generalization of that decomposition scheme for an extended kind of @xmath10-partite two level spin systems when is based on non - local generalized bell states , the bell gems basis @xcite .",
    "structure developed could be understood as a splitting of the @xmath10 quantum information channels into @xmath2 information channels weakly related , in the form of two level subsystems .",
    "problem stated in this work is established for a general hamiltonian for @xmath10 coupled two level systems on @xmath11 . if it is written as a linear combination of tensor products of pauli matrices :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , a set of time dependent real functions in general .",
    "sometimes , as in the second expression in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath16 will be represented as a number @xmath17 when it is expressed in base-4 with @xmath10 digits , @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is its @xmath20 term in that base .",
    "additionally , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 are respectively the unitary matrix and traditional pauli matrices assumed being expressed for the computational basis @xmath24 of each part .",
    "then , it represents a generalized model for spin and polarization systems obeying the schrdinger equation for its associated evolution operator @xmath9 . without loss of generality",
    ", the identity term @xmath25 can be dropped because it only contributes with a global phase .",
    "thus , hamiltonian is traceless , remaining evolution operator belongs to @xmath26 and it can be written as a linear combination of eigenvectors projectors @xmath27 :    @xmath28    clearly , these eigenstates become invariant under time evolution .",
    "@xmath3 decomposition , as it was obtained in @xcite can be induced in general by pairing eigenvalues under an arbitrary rule and then considering @xmath29 orthogonal states @xmath30 obtained by pairs as rotations of each defined pair of eigenvalues :",
    "@xmath31    these transformations directly split the whole hilbert space @xmath32 in a direct sum of subspaces generated by each pair of states and alternatively by the corresponding pair of eigenstates .",
    "there are lots of possibilities for last states in terms of eigenstates and pairings . for them ,",
    "separability or entanglement properties are not necessarily assured as in @xcite , which corresponds only to a particular interaction .",
    "this new basis transforms the diagonal structure of hamiltonian on the basis @xmath33 into a @xmath34 block structure on the basis @xmath35 :    @xmath36    with this , each block is a @xmath34 `` localized '' hamiltonian which can be expressed on a pauli - like basis in @xmath37 : @xmath38 and @xmath39 :    @xmath40    where :    @xmath41    in addition , this structure simplifies and translates quantum error correction procedures into specific flip errors .",
    "it means , @xmath42 can be written as a sum of hamiltonian operators @xmath43 on different two level subspaces @xmath44 .",
    "this block structure is inherited to the evolution matrix via the @xmath45-time ordered integral :    @xmath46    assuring the possibility to apply @xmath3 quantum control optimal schemes :    @xmath47    it implies that @xmath48 ( because one arbitrary factor phase , @xmath49 , in some block depends on remaining phase factors in spite of @xmath50 ) .",
    "informally , we will call to this factorization , the `` @xmath3 decomposition '' due to each block structure ( @xmath51 in reality ) . then",
    ", hilbert space @xmath52 becomes the direct sum of @xmath2 subspaces generated for each associated pair @xmath53 , @xmath54 . in each subspace",
    ", there is a complex mixing dynamics of probabilities , but without mix subspace probabilities .",
    "for @xmath56 , bell gems @xcite form a orthogonal basis of entangled states for @xmath0 particles :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 . at this point , @xmath59 can be considered as the traditional pauli matrices .",
    "in addition , @xmath60 is the set of digits of @xmath61 when it is written in base-4 with @xmath62 digits ( @xmath63 , it means @xmath64 . in a similar way , @xmath65",
    "are numbers written in base-2 with @xmath62 digits ( @xmath66 . then it is possible express the components of @xmath42 in that basis , obtaining a master expression to determine the necessary restrictions to fit their elements in the states @xmath67 for the @xmath3 decomposition :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 ( here , @xmath70 can be removed in spite of the initial discussion ) . in last expressions , the product @xmath71 has some properties in spite of pauli matrices properties . because @xmath72 are traceless and @xmath73 ( negative sign only if @xmath74 ) , then @xmath75 is non - zero only if : a ) @xmath76 , b ) @xmath77 completely different between them , and c ) @xmath77 are equal by pairs .",
    "a remark is convenient in this stage . in some works , as in @xcite , bell gems are preferred be defined using @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 because it lets to have real coefficients when they are expressed in the computational basis @xmath81 ( other alternative definitions can introduce specific phase factor in @xmath59 ) .",
    "we will adopt last definition in the following , which does not produce changes in the previous discussion .",
    "last analysis conduces to a convenient definition : splitting the @xmath0 set of particles , then two parts @xmath82 , are _ correspondents _ if @xmath83 ( they are in the same position of subscripts @xmath84 as the other in the second one @xmath85 ) . in last terms , a careful but direct analysis and development of ( [ hamiltalpha ] ) shows that the @xmath3 decomposition arises when hamiltonian depicts two types of interactions ( by requiring @xmath86 for all @xmath87 in specific entries ) .",
    "the first one ( type i ) comprehends all non local interactions between any correspondent parts in any direction .",
    "these terms generate diagonal entries in the hamiltonian expressed in bell gems basis .",
    "together , it could be include two local interactions in one specific direction on only one pair up most of correspondent parts generating the off diagonal entries to conform the @xmath3 blocks .",
    "note these local interaction terms could be interpreted as external driven fields as in @xcite .",
    "the second one ( type ii ) is obtained substituting the type i local interactions with non local interactions between pairs of any non correspondent parts included in exactly two pairs of correspondent parts .",
    "it means , if @xmath88 with @xmath89 are these two pairs of correspondent parts , then interactions allowed are @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this group of four interactions generates the off diagonal entries to conform @xmath3 blocks .",
    "type ii interaction normally could be interpreted as a non driven process .",
    "figure 1 resumes those two types of interactions .",
    "block decomposition : a ) type i interaction , and b ) type ii interaction.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig1 ]",
    "some applications of @xmath3 decomposition are foreseen .",
    "it can be exploited in quantum control of bigger systems in which control schemes are not well developed as those of @xmath3 dynamics .",
    "the selectivity of pairing is related with the non diagonal elements arisen , it means , with the local interactions in type i case and with no correspondent interactions in type ii case .",
    "this approach to quantum evolution will let control analytically the flow of quantum information in different geometrical arrangements . in a related but not necessarily equivalent direction , selective block decomposition could be useful for unitary factorization in quantum gate design @xcite .",
    "finally , other applications in quantum superdense coding could be engineered for multichannel quantum information storage , using each subspace to storage differentiated information which could be necessary to process simultaneously , by example in quantum image processing ."
