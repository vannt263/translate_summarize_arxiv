    "massive stars end their lives with core - collapse supernovae ( sne  ii / ibc ) , which are the predominant sources of having enriched galaxies with the elements heavier than helium . the other type , thermonuclear supernovae ( sne  ia ) , also contributes to the enrichment of iron - peak elements , which is , however , absent in the early universe .",
    "the metals produced by core - collapse supernovae serve as diagnostic tools to uncover the chemical - enrichment history of the galaxy from its poorly understood early stage to the present day",
    ". a reliable prediction of supernova yields has been , however , hampered by the yet unknown mechanism that causes the explosion .",
    "previous studies of supernova nucleosynthesis have relied upon a number of model parameters such as the explosion energy , the position that divides the ejecta and the remnant ( mass cut ) , and the electron fraction ( @xmath12 , the number of electrons per nucleon ) .",
    "the production of each element in a supernova , in particular of those synthesized in the innermost ejecta , is severely affected by the choice of these parameters ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is obvious that nucleosynthesis studies with self - consistently exploding models are eventually needed to obtain reliable supernova yields .",
    "recent one - dimensional simulations including accurate neutrino transport seem to exclude the possibility of neutrino - driven explosions without the help of multi - dimensional effects @xcite , at least for standard nuclear and neutrino physics input .",
    "an exception are the explosions of @xmath16 stars .",
    "a star in this mass range forms an electron - degenerate core consisting of oxygen , neon , and magnesium ( o - ne - mg ) during the final stage of its evolution ( instead of an iron core in the case of more massive stars ) , and becomes a super asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star .",
    "such a star ends its life either as an o - ne - mg white dwarf or a core - collapse supernova leaving behind a neutron star . for the latter ,",
    "the collapse is induced by electron capture ( what is called an `` electron capture supernova '' ) when the core mass grows to @xmath17 and the central density reaches @xmath18  g  @xmath19 .",
    "however , the uncertainties in mixing and mass loss during the evolution make it difficult to draw a clear line between these two channels @xcite .",
    "recent studies report that only the range close to the upper end ( a mass range of @xmath20 or @xmath21 of all supernovae , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) leads to the explosion channel , although the range could be wider for lower metallicity stars .",
    "the structure of the o - ne - mg core is distinctively different from the iron cores of more massive stars by the fact that it has a steep density gradient in the outermost layers , surrounded by an extremely extended , loosely bound h / he envelope .",
    "recently , @xcite have obtained self - consistent explosions from the collapse of the o - ne - mg core in a stellar progenitor with an initial mass of @xmath0 developed by @xcite .",
    "their one - dimensional simulations with a state - of - the - art , energy - dependent treatment of the neutrino transport are in fact the only recent models in the literature with successful supernova explosions in spherical symmetry for standard nuclear and weak interaction physics ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar result ) .",
    "the explosions are initiated by the rapid outward acceleration of the supernova shock when it encounters the steep density gradient and fast decline of the mass accretion rate at the edge of the o - ne - mg core .",
    "they are powered by the neutrino - heating mechanism , which yields a low explosion energy of @xmath221@xmath23  erg ( for a detailed discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "the new calculations are a revision of previous hydrodynamic results for the same o - ne - mg core , namely , of prompt explosions @xcite , powerful neutrino - driven explosions ( @xmath24  erg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and no explosions @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present nucleosynthesis results for the first 810  ms of the neutrino - driven explosion of a collapsing o - ne - mg core ( electron capture supernova ) , using the thermodynamic trajectories obtained by @xcite . employing a self - consistently calculated explosion model with sophisticated neutrino transport",
    "is of particular importance not only for the nucleosynthesis study itself , but also for a couple of other aspects . on the one hand , the mass range of 8@xmath1 accounts for about 30% of all the core - collapse supernova events , if all the range leads to the explosion channel .",
    "the electron capture supernovae can thus be potentially significant contributors to the galactic chemical evolution of some species .",

    "figure  2 shows the luminosities and mean energies for neutrinos of all types as functions of the post - bounce time @xmath26 in model st ; these results are taken from @xcite and used for calculating the rates of neutrino - induced reactions .",
    "more preciously , we should apply those quantities in the co - moving frame of the fluid with corrections for the gravitational redshift and for doppler shifting due to fluid motion .",
    "we neglect such effects , which are important on the one hand only when the fluid is relatively close to the neutrino sphere ( @xmath40  km ) , where the temperature is still higher than @xmath41 ( see below ) . on the other hand , at large distances , where the expansion velocities of the gas are larger , neutrino interactions become essentially irrelevant .",
    "each nucleosynthesis calculation is initiated when the temperature decreases to @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 ) . in the first ejected trajectory ,",
    "the highest temperature is @xmath43 ( fig .  1 ) , which is taken to be the initial condition for this case only .",
    "at such high temperatures , the composition is in the nuclear statistical equilibrium ( mostly free nucleons and few @xmath44 particles ) , which is realized immediately after the calculation starts .",
    "the initial compositions is then given by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the mass fractions of free neutrons and protons , and @xmath49 is the initial electron fraction at @xmath41 ( fig .  3 , _ black line _ for model st ) .",
    "in subsection 3.1 , we will present the nucleosynthesis results for the unmodified model ( st ) of @xcite , and the corresponding information for variations of model st will then be discussed in the following subsections . in each model ,",
    "the nucleosynthetic yields for all the trajectories are mass - integrated over the ejecta - mass range .",
    "the nucleosynthesis results of the unmodified model ( st ) are shown in figures  4 ( isotopes ) and 5 ( elements ) . both plots present the overproduction factors defined by the mass fractions in the ejecta with respect to their solar values @xcite .",
    "the even-@xmath50 and odd-@xmath50 species are denoted by circles and triangles , respectively . in figure  4 , the isotopes for a given element are connected by lines , and the abundances smaller than @xmath51 are omitted .",
    "the dotted horizontal lines indicate a `` normalization band '' between the largest production factor ( @xmath11zr and zr in figs .  4 and 5 , respectively ) and a factor of ten smaller than that , along with the median value ( _ dashed line _ ) . this band is taken to be representative of the uncertainty in the nuclear data involved . in the following",
    ", we consider that electron capture supernovae can be contributors to the solar ( or galactic ) inventories of the species located within the normalization band .",
    "figure  4 indicates that , along with the marginal ones , model st can account for the production of @xmath52zn , @xmath5ge , @xmath53se , @xmath54kr , @xmath9sr , @xmath11zr , and @xmath10mo , where all the light @xmath6-nuclei ( _ filled circles _ ) up to @xmath55 are included .",
    "however , only a few elements ( zn , ge , y , and zr ) fall into the normalization band ( fig .",

    "our result for model st is in reasonable agreement with that in ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) in @xcite , while we consider only the calculated zones with @xmath56 .",
    "this leads to the hundred times larger values of @xmath57 in this paper . ] , and some differences are due to the slightly higher minimum @xmath12 in our model (   3.5 ) .",
    "figure  6 shows the mass fractions of some important isotopes ( after decay ) for model st ( _ top _ ) and these mass fractions relative to their solar values ( _ bottom _ ) as functions of the enclosed mass @xmath58 . in each mass shell , the dominant heavy isotope is either @xmath2fe ( produced in the form of @xmath2ni ) or @xmath59ni , depending on @xmath49 . in the neutron - rich ejecta ,",
    "the nuclear products in the single quasi - statistical - equilibrium ( qse ) cluster have peaks at @xmath60 and @xmath61 because of the strong binding at @xmath62 and 50 @xcite .",
    "the abundance of @xmath11zr is maximal in the mass shell with the lowest @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , the matter with @xmath64 is so _ proton - rich _ ( compared to the average of the stable isotopes in the vicinity , e.g. , the proton fraction of @xmath11zr is 0.44 ) that the successive proton captures lead to the production of light @xmath6-nuclei up to @xmath65 .",
    "this can also be seen in the early neutrino - driven winds @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that such a nucleosynthesis result that stems from the low-@xmath12 ( @xmath66 ) matter in the early ejecta may be a unique characteristics of collapsing o - ne - mg cores . in the present model ,",
    "the explosion sets in immediately after core bounce and the ejecta rapidly expand , where the ejection of low @xmath12 matter seems unavoidable ( see fig",
    ".  1 ) . for more massive progenitors ( @xmath67 ) ,",
    "the explosion is expected to be more delayed and to eject neutrino - processed matter , where the bulk of the ejecta may have @xmath68 @xcite .    as will be discussed in   4 , the maximum overproduction factor of @xmath69 for model st ( fig .",
    "4 ) poses a severe constraint on the occurrence of this type of events to be no more than @xmath70 of all core - collapse supernovae .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusions by @xcite . in the simulation of @xcite (",
    "also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the deceleration of the shock in the outer envelope slows the expansion of the ejecta only slightly .",
    "therefore we do not expect any substantial fallback of the once ejected matter onto the remnant , as it is presumed to take place in the case of more massive progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in the following subsections we thus explore possible modifications to model st , which instead of fallback might provide a solution for moderating the extremely large overproduction of , in particular , @xmath11zr .",
    "first , we examine nucleosynthesis in the explosion model calculated with the wh eos in @xcite .",
    "this model ( hereafter wh ) has thermodynamic trajectories very similar to those of model st , but a slightly larger ejecta mass ( @xmath71 ) and a slightly lower minimal @xmath49 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "another eos by @xcite , which is also currently available for core - collapse simulations , falls between the st and wh eoss in terms of its _ stiffness _ and a variety of results of core - collapse simulations , e.g.  the radii of shock formation and stagnation or the size of the neutrino luminosities ( see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we suspect that a comparison of the nucleosynthesis results between models st and wh well brackets the uncertainties arising from different eoss .",
    "all nucleosynthesis calculations are repeated with the thermodynamic trajectories and the initial compositions deduced from the @xmath49-mass profile ( fig .",
    "3 ) of model wh . figure  7a shows the mass fractions ( _ bottom _ ) in the ejecta for models st and wh , along with their ratios @xmath73 ( _ top _ ) , as functions of the mass number @xmath74 . differences exceeding a factor of 2 ( indicated by _ dotted lines _ ) can be seen for the light species with @xmath75 . however , the differences are well below a factor of 2 for the dominant species in the vicinity of the qse peaks at @xmath76 , and 90 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the uncertainties arising from different nuclear eoss are not of great importance , at least for the currently available versions of eoss .",
    "we note , however , that the wh eos leads to a @xmath77 larger @xmath2ni mass than that for the ls eos ( table  1 ) .",
    "this suggests that eoss play a crucial role to precisely determine the @xmath2ni ejecta mass from an electron capture supernova .      in all the present calculations ,",
    "the nucleosynthetic flows proceed along or in the vicinity of the @xmath38-stability line , forming the qse peaks at @xmath78 , 60 , and 90 .",
    "the nuclear masses of relevance , which are the most important factors in this case , are measured with high enough accuracy @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not expect a sizable change of the nucleosynthesis result arising from the uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates .    as a test ,",
    "we repeat all the nucleosynthesis calculations of model st with the theoretical rates @xcite replaced by those of @xcite .",
    "both data sets are based on the statistical ( hauser - feshbach ) approach with the experimental masses whenever available , but with different theoretical masses and different nuclear level densities .",
    "the results ( labelled by rt ) are compared to those of model st in figure  7b .",
    "factors of @xmath79 difference can be seen for the nuclei between @xmath80 and 45 ( fig .  8 , _ top _ ) , which have , however , very small mass fractions ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "the differences for dominant species around @xmath78 , 60 , and 90 are well below a factor of 2 .      a potentially important effect that is lacking in the one - dimensional simulations of @xcite is convective mixing of the ejecta ( see the results of a two - dimensional simulation of a collapsing o - ne - mg core in * ? ? ?",
    "figure  8 shows the profiles of temperature ( _ top _ ) , entropy ( _ middle _ ) , and @xmath12 ( _ bottom _ ) versus mass at early times ( @xmath81 , and 228  ms ) and at the end of the simulation ( @xmath82  ms ) .",
    "we find a negative entropy gradient forming at a temperature high enough for @xmath44-processing ( @xmath83 , which is indicated by the dashed line in the top panel of fig .",
    "this can cause convective overturn and one might speculate that this could moderate the neutron - richness to some extent _ before _ the freezeout .    as a limiting case , we present the result with the initial composition being determined by the @xmath49-mass profile shown by the green line in figure  3 ( hereafter , model mx ) .",
    "we assume here that the ejecta between 1.367 and @xmath84 ( indicated by vertical dotted lines in fig .",
    "9 ) get completely mixed on microscopic scales to have a mass - averaged constant @xmath49 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "we find that the species having the largest overproduction , i.e. , @xmath11zr in model st , is replaced by @xmath4zn with ten times smaller value in model mx ( fig .",
    "the largest overproduction of zr ( as element ) is replaced by that of zn ( fig .",
    "because of the increased minimum value of @xmath49 ( @xmath86 ) the overproduction of @xmath11zr becomes unimportant .",
    "it should be noted , however , that a corresponding two - dimensional simulation ( carried out until 262  ms after core bounce ; see @xcite and mller and janka 2008 , in preparation ) with the same initial o - ne - mg core does not show any such small - scale mixing .",
    "instead , the accreted post - shock gas makes one quick overturn ( fully developed convection with many overturns does not occur ) , after which the rising material in rayleigh - taylor mushrooms is directly ejected and self - similar expansion is quickly established .",
    "hence , there may not be sufficient time for mixing and homogenization on small scales . as will be discussed in ",
    "3.5 , however , a slight increase of @xmath87 ( e.g. , @xmath88 ; from 0.464 to 0.468 ) is already enough to significantly moderate the overproduction of @xmath11zr .",
    "therefore , partial mixing of the ejecta induced by convection might be sufficient to cure this overproduction problem .",
    "the negative entropy gradient may have a variety of other effects .",
    "one is that the convective overturn could stretch the mean duration of the neutrino irradiation of ejected matter and could also lead to regions of ejecta with higher @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , a recent two - dimensional simulation with a more massive progenitor ( @xmath89 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that the bulk of the ejecta turns out to be proton - rich ( @xmath90 ) . in the present case ,",
    "however , the convective overturn may not have exactly the same effects as in more massive progenitors , because the steep density gradient of the o - ne - mg core with its transition to an extremely dilute h - rich envelope makes the core structure distinctively different from that of more massive stars . as a consequence ,",
    "the supernova ejecta accelerate much faster than in more massive stars , and the convective pattern in the overturn region freezes out in the self - similar expansion more quickly .",
    "therefore convective mixing is rather inefficient and , moreover , it is possible that the neutrino - heated bubbles rise so rapidly away from the neutrino - sphere that clumps of low-@xmath12 material get ejected , a possibility that may be anticipated from the bottom panel of figure  8 ( e.g. , the red and green lines there ) .",
    "this might increase the overproduction of other @xmath91 species ( @xmath92kr , @xmath93rb , @xmath94sr , @xmath95y ) .",
    "in fact , some neutron - rich blobs ( down to @xmath96 , but with a tiny mass ) are found in the preliminary results of the mentioned two - dimensional simulation ( mller and janka 2008 , in preparation , see also * ? ? ?",
    "it should be noted that even two - dimensional models with their constraint of axisymmetry may not yield a sufficiently accurate mass distribution of the ejecta as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "such a sensitive information might ultimately require three - dimensional simulations to allow for reliable conclusions concerning nucleosynthesis yields and production factors .      from figure  6",
    "we conclude that the large overproduction of @xmath11zr in model st is mainly due to the neutron - rich ejecta with @xmath49 between @xmath97 and 0.470 .",
    "the demonstration in   3.4 ( fig .",
    "9 ) shows that boosting @xmath87 to 0.480 indeed removes the overproduction of @xmath11zr .",
    "motivated by this result , we explore in this subsection that how much increase of @xmath87 could cure this extreme overproduction problem .",
    "we repeat that the @xmath49 values are obtained from state - of - the - art simulations with sophisticated , energy - dependent neutrino transport in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it is a great challenge to determine @xmath12 to an accuracy of a few percent , because the neutron - to - proton ratio in the ejecta is established by a delicate competition of electron neutrino and antineutrino captures and their inverse reactions , in particular around the radius where the kinetic equilibrium of these processes breaks down because the rates become slower than the expansion rate of the accelerating ejecta ( for a detailed discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "besides the limited numerical resolution ( in particular of the neutrino energy spectra ) a variety of other effects can be imagined to imply uncertainties at the percent level , for example the potential effects of convective mixing on microscopic scales (   3.4 ) , future refinements in the employed microphysics ( e.g. , eoss , neutrino interaction rates , electron captures rates ) , possible effects due to nonstandard neutrino properties ( e.g. , flavor oscillations in the supernova core ) , and the uncertainties associated with the stellar evolution calculations of @xmath16 stars .    in order to test small variations of @xmath87",
    ", we examine nucleosynthesis for the trajectories of model st but with the original @xmath49 profile replaced by @xmath98 .",
    "the multiplicative factor @xmath99 is taken to be 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 ( hereafter , models fp1 , fp2 , and fp3 ) . the @xmath49-@xmath58 profiles of these models are similar , but each model has a different @xmath87 ( see fig .  3 for model fp3 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath87 for these models are slightly increased compared to that of model st to be 0.468 , 0.471 , and 0.475 , respectively ( table  1 ) .",
    "we find that the production of @xmath11zr is extremely sensitive to @xmath87 ( figure  11 ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath87 by only @xmath14 ( @xmath100 and 0.011 in models fp1 and fp3 , respectively ) reduces the production factor of @xmath11zr by roughly two orders of magnitude .",
    "other species like @xmath4zn , @xmath7se , and @xmath8kr then possess the largest production factors .",
    "in the case of model fp3 these have one tenth of the values in model st .",
    "figure  12 indicates that electron capture supernovae could be the dominant sources of the elemental abundance of zn , if such a slightly higher @xmath49 was correct .",
    "the results for @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ( hereafter , models fm1 , fm2 , and fm3 ) are shown in figures  13 and 14 .",
    "the values of @xmath87 are then decreased to 0.460 , 0.457 , and 0.453 , respectively ( table  1 ) . the @xmath49-@xmath58 profile for model fm3",
    "is also displayed in figure  3 .",
    "the overproduction of @xmath11zr becomes more serious in these models , and other @xmath91 species ( @xmath94sr and @xmath95y ) enter into the normalization band in the case of model fm3 .",
    "the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) resemble those for our model fm3 rather than those for model st .",
    "this is probably explained by the fact that @xcite perform their evaluation for ejecta with a value of @xmath104 , which is close to @xmath87 in model fm3 ( @xmath105 ) , but slightly smaller than @xmath87 in model st .",
    "the small difference between the ejecta conditions in @xcite and those of model st originates from a different density structure assumed for the dilute h / he envelope around the collapsing o - ne - mg core considered by @xcite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more detail ) .",
    "the results presented in this subsection imply that the overproduction of @xmath11zr may not be as serious as reported by @xcite , because an increase of @xmath87 by only @xmath106 cures this problem .",
    "this is a significant improvement compared to the situation in the older simulations by @xcite , where @xmath87 was found to be around 0.4 and a substantial change ( @xmath107 ) of @xmath87 was necessary to avoid the overproduction of @xmath108 nuclei .",
    "the @xmath109p - process ( or neutrino - induced rp - process ) is now believed to be a promising nuclear process that synthesizes light @xmath6-nuclei up to @xmath110 @xcite . in this process , a fraction of free protons are converted to neutrons by neutrino capture in the early proton - rich supernova ejecta .",
    "the @xmath38-waiting points on the classical rp - process path ( e.g. , @xmath4ge with the half - life of 1.06 minutes ) are then bypassed via much faster neutron capture .",
    "the current models contain proton - rich ejecta ( up to 0.53 , figs .  1 and  3 ) , where one may expect the occurrence of the @xmath109p - process .    the @xmath109p - process plays , however , no role in producing the @xmath6-nuclei ,",
    "although all the examined models in this study include neutrino - induced reactions on free nucleons and @xmath44 particles . in order to test the effect of neutrinos , the result without neutrino - induced reactions ( labelled no@xmath109 , otherwise using the same input as in model st )",
    "is compared with that of model st ( fig .",
    "we find that neutron capture , which is absent without neutrino - induced reactions , diminishes the nuclei with @xmath111 .",
    "the mass fractions of these isotopes are , however , very small compared to the dominant species at @xmath78 , 60 , and 90 .",
    "no substantial differences can be seen for the nuclei with @xmath112 because of the moderate proton - richness ( up to @xmath113 ) , moderate entropy ( up to @xmath114 per nucleon , where @xmath115 is the boltzmann constant ) , and the fast expansion of the ejecta",
    ". the proton - rich ejecta quickly cool down below @xmath116 , which is the relevant temperature range for the @xmath109p - process to take place ( i.e. , the proton captures are fast and their inverse reactions slow ) .",
    "the @xmath109p - process might be efficient only in core - collapse supernovae from more massive progenitors ( e.g. , @xmath117 ) , which have a shallower density gradient at the core edge and a denser envelope and thus their explosions develop in a different way with different conditions for nucleosynthesis .",

    "instead , we propose the abundance of @xmath4zn , whose production is insensitive to small variations of @xmath49 ( table  1 ) , to serve as a strong constraint on the occurrence of this type of supernovae . as an example , we consider model fp3 ( fig",

    "<S> we examine nucleosynthesis in the electron capture supernovae of progenitor agb stars with an o - ne - mg core ( with the initial stellar mass of @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thermodynamic trajectories for the first 810  ms after core bounce are taken from a recent state - of - the - art hydrodynamic simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the presented nucleosynthesis results are characterized by a number of distinct features that are not shared with those of other supernovae from the collapse of stars with iron core ( with initial stellar masses of more than @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> first is the small amount of @xmath2ni ( @xmath3 ) in the ejecta , which can be an explanation for observed properties of faint supernovae such as sne  2008s and 1997d . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the large ni / fe ratio is in reasonable agreement with the spectroscopic result of the crab nebula ( the relic of sn  1054 ) . </S>",
    "<S> second is the large production of @xmath4zn , @xmath5ge , light @xmath6-nuclei ( @xmath7se , @xmath8kr , @xmath9sr , and @xmath10mo ) , and in particular , @xmath11zr , which originates from the low @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , the number of electrons per nucleon ) ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , that only a @xmath14 increase of the minimum @xmath12 moderates the overproduction of @xmath11zr . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the production of @xmath4zn is fairly robust against a small variation of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this provides the upper limit of the occurrence of this type of events to be about @xmath15 of all core - collapse supernovae . </S>"
