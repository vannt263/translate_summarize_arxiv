    "the perovskite family of oxides shows a great compositional variety . recently ,",
    "a new structural class of hexagonal perovskites has started to attract increasing attention due to their extraordinary magnetic properties .",
    "these materials are based on the general formula @xmath4 ( @xmath5 alkaline earth ; @xmath6 transition metal ) and crystallize in the trigonal @xmath7 structure @xcite with space group @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , no .",
    "167 ) . in these compounds ,",
    "transition metal - oxygen polyhedra form well separated chains running parallel to the trigonal axis ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for a representation of the crystal structure .",
    "space between the chains is filled with the @xmath10 cations .",
    "each chain consists of alternating , face - sharing @xmath11 trigonal prisms and @xmath12 octahedra . typically , the ratio of interchain to small intrachain metal - metal distance is of the order of two , this fact explaining the importance of metal - metal bonding and the pronounced one - dimensionality .",
    "the chains themselves are arranged on a triangular lattice . as a consequence , in addition to showing the abovementioned unique properties these compounds allow to study geometric frustration effects such as partial disorder and spin - glass like behaviour .",
    "a prominent member of this class is @xmath13 , which has two inequivalent cobalt sites , one in octahedral environment ( labelled co1 ) and the other ( co2 ) centered in the trigonal prisms @xcite .",
    "neutron diffraction measurements revealed low- and high - spin moments of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , at these sites . together with susceptibility measurements they point towards a ferromagnetic coupling along the chains , and an antiferromagnetic one in the buckling a - b plane .",
    "susceptibility @xcite , specific heat @xcite , and @xmath16-sr @xcite measurements clearly demonstrate the onset of three - dimensional ordering at @xmath17k , while a second transition was found at @xmath18k @xcite .",
    "magnetization measurements showed a plateau at @xmath19 per f.u .  for low field and a steep increase by a factor of three at about 3.5 t , which was interpreted as a ferri- to ferromagnetic transition @xcite .",
    "in addition , the magnetization versus field curves display a rich structure below 12k @xcite .",
    "in particular , the magnetization at saturation exceeds the ( spin only ) expected value of 4 @xmath20/f.u . , indicating that the angular momentum is not fully quenched .",
    "electronic structure calculations revealed i ) low- and high - spin moments , respectively , at the octahedral and trigonal prismatic cobalt sites in good agreement with the experimental data , ii ) a rather large oxygen moment due to polarization by the high - spin cobalt sites , which together give rise to the formation of extended but still well localized @xmath21 moments , and iii ) strong contributions to the ferromagnetic intrachain coupling from the @xmath22 states of the low - spin octahedral cobalt atoms @xcite . recently , mapping these results onto a heisenberg model we were able to underline the importance of the interplay of different crystal field splittings , @xmath23-@xmath24 hybridizations , and metal - metal overlap for the ferromagnetic intrachain order @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the origin of the ferromagnetic intrachain coupling is still a matter of intense debate . in order to resolve the issue we have turned to the related compounds @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which have the same crystal structure as @xmath13 as well as very similar electronic properties @xcite .",
    "however , while @xmath0 likewise shows ferromagnetic intrachain order , the coupling is antiferromagnetic in the iron compound .",
    "hence , by studying these systems we will contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying exchange mechanisms .    to be specific , according to susceptibility and neutron diffraction measurements @xmath0 undergoes two transitions at @xmath25k and @xmath26k , which are attributed to the ferromagnetic intrachain and the antiferromagnetic interchain coupling , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , the specific heat did not exhibit any strong anomaly at these temperatures @xcite .",
    "thus , elucidating the nature of the transitions requires more investigations .",
    "again , the interaction across the chains is antiferromagnetic driving the system into a partially disordered antiferromagnetic ( pda ) state at intermediate temperatures .",
    "however , application of small magnetic fields results in a ferrimagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "neutron diffraction data suggest both the cobalt and rhodium ions to be trivalent @xcite .",
    "spin states are @xmath27 at the trigonal prismatic cobalt sites and @xmath28 at the octahedral rhodium sites .",
    "the magnetic moment amounts to 3.7@xmath20 per cobalt ion and is oriented parallel to the @xmath29-axis .",
    "the magnetic ordering of @xmath1 turns out to be less complex than in the cobaltate .",
    "susceptibility data reveal a single transition into a three - dimensional antiferromagnetic phase at 12k @xcite with the easy axis oriented parallel to the chains as well as divalent iron in a @xmath27 high - spin state and tetravalent rhodium in a @xmath30 low - spin state .",
    "in contrast , mssbauer experiments were interpreted in favour of trivalent iron and @xmath31 @xcite . for the saturation magnetization a value of 3.74@xmath20 per f.u .",
    "has been given @xcite .",
    "the density functional calculations were performed using the scalar - relativistic augmented spherical wave ( asw ) method @xcite . in order to represent the correct shape of the crystal potential in the large voids of the open crystal structure , additional augmentation spheres were inserted .",
    "optimal augmentation sphere positions as well as radii of all spheres were automatically generated by the sphere geometry optimization ( sgo ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "self - consistency was achieved by an efficient algorithm for convergence acceleration @xcite .",
    "brillouin zone sampling was done using an increased number of @xmath32-points ranging from 28 to 770 points within the irreducible wedge .",
    "using the powder data of niitaka _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we performed , in a first step , a set of calculations , where spin - degeneracy was enforced @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ,    which includes the partial densities of states of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 . while we observe o @xmath2 dominated bands between @xmath33 and @xmath34ev , three groups of bands of mainly metal @xmath23-character",
    "are found at higher energies . due to @xmath23@xmath24 hybridization substantial @xmath24/@xmath23 contributions",
    "appear above / below @xmath35ev , reaching up to 40% in the upper valence and conduction bands .    at the rhodium sites",
    ", the octahedral crystal field leads to nearly perfect splitting of the @xmath36 states into occupied @xmath37 and empty @xmath38 states .",
    "in contrast , the trigonal crystal field at the cobalt / iron sites results in a splitting into non - degenerate @xmath39 as well as doubly degenerate @xmath40 and @xmath41 states . while , due to strong @xmath42-type @xmath23@xmath24 bonding , the rh @xmath36 @xmath38 states form the high - energy peak above @xmath43ev , the peak below traces back to co / fe @xmath41 states . as a consequence ,",
    "spin - polarization of the latter bands is highly favourable this explaining the observed high - spin / low - spin scenario .",
    "spin - polarized calculations performed in a second step lead to the observed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic behaviour found for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . as a result , we obtain well localized magnetic moments of @xmath44 ( rh ) , @xmath45 ( co ) , @xmath46 ( o ) , and @xmath47 ( ca ) for the cobaltate as well as @xmath47 ( rh ) , @xmath48 ( fe ) , @xmath46 ( o ) , and @xmath49 ( ca ) for the ferrate .",
    "these values reflect the experimental result of low- and high - spin states at the octahedral and trigonal prismatic sites , respectively . the total moment per unit cell ( i.e.  per two formula units",
    ") amounts to @xmath50 for @xmath0 and @xmath51 per sublattice in @xmath1 .",
    "worth mentioning are the rather high magnetic moments at the oxygen sites arising from the strong @xmath23@xmath24 hybridization , which sum up to about @xmath52 per trigonal prism .",
    "adding to the @xmath22 moment they lead to the formation of extended localized moments already observed in @xmath13 @xcite and confirm the formal fe @xmath31 and rh @xmath53 spin configurations .    according to a more detailed analysis the increased iron moment as compared to that of cobalt arises from the energetical upshift of the bands due to the reduced electron count and can be attributed to the @xmath40 orbitals . however , since these orbitals point perpendicular to the chain axis their contribution affects mainly the size of the local moment and to a much lesser degree the intrachain coupling .    in order to understand this puzzling result",
    "we turn back to the spin - degenerate calculations and investigate the near-@xmath54 bands , which are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ]    .",
    "contributions of the rh @xmath3 ( left ) and co @xmath55 ( right ) orbitals are indicated by bars.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    and [ fig4 ] .    .",
    "contributions of the rh @xmath3 ( left ) and fe @xmath55 ( right ) orbitals are indicated by bars.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    the length of the bars appended to the bands is a measure of the contributions of the respective orbitals . note that these orbitals refer to the global coordinate system with the @xmath56-axis along the chain direction .",
    "obviously , all bands display strong dispersion parallel to the chain axis ( i.e.   the line @xmath57-a ) , reflecting the one - dimensionality of the compounds , while weak dispersions perpendicular to this line indicate small interchain coupling .",
    "according to figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , the most strongly dispersing bands are of almost pure @xmath39 character with similar contributions from both transition metal sites , pointing to the strong metal - metal bonding within the chains . while the band dispersions are quite similar for both cobaltates and the ferrate , important differences arise from the reduced band filling in the latter , which drastically alters the fermi surface . in general ,",
    "due to the almost perfect one - dimensional dispersion , the fermi surfaces consist of flat sheets perpendicular to the @xmath29 axis , i.e.  the line @xmath57-a .",
    "however , while in the cobaltates the @xmath56-position of the fermi surface is at the @xmath57-point , we observe perfect nesting in @xmath1 with the fermi surface sheets at the a - point . as a consequence ,",
    "the ferrate , but not the cobaltates , is susceptible to a fermi surface instability against an antiferrodistortive mode or else the observed antiferromagnetic intrachain order .",
    "as for the previously investigated @xmath13 , electronic structure calculations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 reveal strong effects of the local coordination on the electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "in particular , low- and high - spin moments are obtained at the octahedral rh sites and at the trigonal prismatic co / fe sites , respectively .",
    "strong @xmath23@xmath24 hybridization results in considerable oxygen polarization , giving rise to the formation of extended magnetic moments localized at the prisms .",
    "metal - metal bonding via rh @xmath3 orbitals lays ground for large contributions to the intrachain exchange coupling . differences between the cobaltates and the ferrate due to the reduced electron count in the latter show up in the additional polarization of the fe @xmath58 states .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding band shifts have drastic effects for the fermi surface , leading to almost perfect nesting and an a - point instability , which drives the observed antiferromagnetic intrachain order .",
