    "when the `` new '' star in andromeda appeared in 1885 with its striking association with the great andromeda nebula , it was still a long way to go until the recognition that these phenomena represent , like nothing else , our deep relation with the universe .",
    "shortly after 1920 , astronomers learned that the andromeda nebula was located far outside our milky way and that the `` nova '' s andromedae must have been much more luminous than any other nova .",
    "thus fritz zwicky created the term _ supernova _ ( sn ) for these events , of which by 1930 only a handful had been detected in external galaxies .    today",
    "it is common wisdom that supernovae are largely responsible for the enrichment of the universe with heavy elements and thus also enable the existence of life .",
    "supernova detections are no longer a matter of incident alone : sophisticated supernova searches with automatic telescopes are now routinely conducted and , thanks to these efforts , we have detected 1387 sn events until february 1999 .",
    "morphological classification is one of the first scientific steps on the way to the understanding of a new phenomenon .",
    "it is amazing that the first attempts to classify sne still provide the basis , although our classification scheme has become more subtle and we now know that the morphological phenomenon `` supernova '' embraces physically distinct processes ( for the early years see the excellent review of trimble @xcite , a recent review on sne ia as distance indicators is from branch @xcite ) .    as did minkowski in 1936 , we still basically distinguish two types of sne , types i and ii . this classification is purely spectroscopic : type i events do not show hydrogen lines in their spectra , while type ii events do so .",
    "an important observation can be made with respect to the parent population of sne : type i appears in all sorts of galaxies , while type ii seems to be restricted to galaxies with a young stellar population , i.e. spiral galaxies and irregulars . for many years",
    ", the canonical interpretation was that the progenitors of type i stem from an old stellar population .",
    "a popular model is a matter - accreting white dwarf in a binary system which becomes unstable when the chandrasekhar mass limit is reached .",
    "then the star explodes by thermonuclear detonation or deflagration @xcite ( which is just another expression for super- or subsonic movement of the burning front but is nevertheless very important in modelling the event ) , but see kundt @xcite for difficulties of this model . on the other hand ,",
    "type ii was thought to be the explosion of a massive star , whose core collapses at the end of its evolution , forms a neutron star ( already zwicky had this vision ) , and the released gravitational energy ( about @xmath2erg ) drives the expansion of the outer shells ( in a complicated and not yet fully understood manner ) . regarding the energetics of type ii events , it soon became clear that radiation and the kinetic energy of the shell must be only a tiny fraction of the total energy ( @xmath3erg ) , the rest being emitted as neutrinos .",
    "the detection of neutrinos from sn1987a was a triumph to this theory ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the coarse classification depending on the spectral hydrogen features is further refined .",
    "the subclassification of type ii by the shape of the light curve appears useful , distinguishing sne ii with ( ii__p _ _ for _ _ p__lateau ) or without plateaus ( ii__l _ _ for _ _ l__inear ) , which basically depends on the thickness of the hydrogen shell and the speed at which the @xmath4h - ionisation front moves inward during expansion . but type",
    "i sne are also subclassified into ia , ib and ic . by 1983 ,",
    "a few type i sne had been observed which developed strong radio emission a few weeks after maximum light .",
    "this is now commonly interpreted as the core collapse and subsequent explosion of the outer layers of a massive evolved star ( for instance a wolf - rayet star ) which lost its hydrogen shell prior to the explosion .",
    "this new type of sn without hydrogen lines and massive progenitor was named ib or ic , depending on whether helium lines were strong or not .",
    "the remaining type ia is spectroscopically distinct from ib by the occurrence of @xmath4si lines in an otherwise very similar spectrum .    for more information on sn classification",
    "refer to wheeler & harkness @xcite and filippenko @xcite .      in a modern compilation ( asiago catalogue @xcite )",
    ", we now have 403 classified ia events at the time of writing ( may 1999 ) . their distribution among the host galaxies",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hosts ] .",
    "the abscissa is de  vaucouleurs classification , where the extreme numbers are @xmath5 ( elliptical galaxies ) and @xmath6 ( late - type irregulars ) .",
    "it is apparent that ia in elliptical galaxies are rarer than in spiral galaxies .",
    "if we normalise to luminosity , then the difference becomes even more obvious .",
    "table  [ tab : snstat ] shows the sn ia rate in different galaxy types according to et  al .",
    "if we recall that a typical @xmath7-ratio in elliptical galaxies is about 8 and in spiral galaxies about 0.05 , then it becomes clear that a unit mass in spiral galaxies produces many more sne than in elliptical galaxies .",
    "this would be understandable if spiral galaxies had more opportunities to let ia s explode than elliptical galaxies have .",
    "indeed , the former hypothesis , that all ia s are explosions of chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs in old population environments , now stands on very weak grounds .",
    "recent investigations have revealed that there exists a weak statistical correlation with spiral arms in spiral galaxies @xcite , which speaks in favour of the contribution of a parent population of massive stars for at least some ia s . on the other hand , in elliptical galaxies , at best very few massive stars",
    "exist , so one is driven towards the conclusion that ia s originate in young _ and _ old populations . a further , quite irritating observation is that ia s seem to avoid the central regions of ellipticals and spirals @xcite , so that the old bulge populations apparently are not effective producers of ia events .",
    "some researchers even propose that every supernovae has a massive progenitor , e.g. kundt @xcite .",
    "however , our theme is not the physics of ia s but how they can be exploited to obtain the hubble constant . in the next section",
    ", we shall see that in spite of a probably non - uniform origin , ia s exhibit stunningly homogeneous properties which make them excellent standard candles .",
