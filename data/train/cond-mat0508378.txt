    "the mixed valent transition metal oxides , that simultaneously contain metal atoms in two ( or more ) different valence states , are of strong current interest.@xcite one of the classical examples of such a system is magnetite ( fe@xmath10o@xmath0 ) , in which a first - order metal - insulator transition occurs at @xmath11120k.@xcite according to verwey , this transition is caused by the spatial ordering of 2 + and 3 + fe cations on the octahedral @xmath12-sublattice of the inverted spinel structure ab@xmath13o@xmath0.@xcite recently , a local spin density approximation ( lsda)+@xmath2 study of the low - temperature phase of fe@xmath10o@xmath0 resulted in a charge and orbitally ordered insulating ground state with a well pronounced orbital order.@xcite however , the strong difference in @xmath4 occupancies of 2 + and 3 + fe was found to be drastically reduced by effective `` static '' screening.@xcite a similar result ( see ref .  )",
    "has been obtained for another iron oxide , containing both 2 + and 3 + fe cations , iron oxoborate ( fe@xmath13obo@xmath10 ) , which shows a broad semiconductor - to - semiconductor transition at @xmath11317k associated ( as in fe@xmath10o@xmath0 ) with a spatial order - disorder transformation of 2 + and 3 + fe cations on quasi - one - dimensional fe chains.@xcite    the aforementioned phenomena of sharp metal - insulator transitions associated with pronounced charge and/or orbital ordering are characteristic for the _ magnli _ phases @xmath14 ( @xmath15).@xcite these compounds form a homologous series and have been studied recently to understand the differences in crystal structures and electronic properties between the end members @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath19).@xcite in particular , the metal - insulator transition of @xmath20 discovered some fifty years ago still is the subject of ongoing controversy and is another `` hot topic '' in solid state physics .",
    "lda calculations have revealed strong influence of the structural degrees of freedom on the electronic properties of @xmath20 and neighbouring rutile - type dioxides.@xcite in this scenario the characteristic dimerization and antiferroelectric displacement of the metal atoms translate into orbital ordering within the @xmath21 states and a peierls - like singlet formation between neighbouring sites .",
    "recently , this was confirmed by lda+dmft calculations , which suggested to regard the transition of @xmath20 as a correlation - assisted peierls - transition.@xcite    ti@xmath0o@xmath1 titanium oxide is another remarkable member of the _ magnli _ phases with @xmath22=4 which shows metal - insulator transitions associated with the spatial charge ordering .",
    "it is a mixed valent compound which has an even mixture of 3 + and 4 + ti cations ( ti@xmath23ti@xmath24o@xmath1 ) , corresponding to an average @xmath3 occupation of 1/2 electron per ti site .",
    "electrical resistivity , specific heat , magnetic susceptibility , and x - ray diffraction data reveal two first - order transitions in the temperature range of 130 - 150k.@xcite at 150k a metal - semiconductor transition occurs without measureable hysteresis in resistivity and specific heat .",
    "it is followed by a semiconductor - semiconductor transition at 130 - 140k , which again is characterized by an almost two orders of magnitude abrupt increase in electrical resistivity and has a hysteresis of several degrees .",
    "@xcite the magnetic susceptibility shows a sharp enhancement when heating through 150k .",
    "however , it is small and temperature independent below this temperature and does not show any anomaly at 140k .    the crystal structure of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : struc ] ) can be viewed as rutile - type slabs of infinite extension and four ti sites thickness , separated by shear planes with a corundum - like atomic arrangement . below 130k",
    "it crystallizes in a triclinic crystal structure with two formula units per primitive unit cell.@xcite four crystallographically inequivalent ti sites are found at the centers of distorted oxygen octahedra .",
    "they form two types of chains , namely , ( a ) 1 - 3 - 3 - 1 and ( b ) 2 - 4 - 4 - 2 , which run parallel to the pseudo - rutile @xmath25-axis and are separated by the crystallographic shear planes . although interatomic distances in the ( b)-chain are almost uniform ( 3.01 and 3.07   between 4 - 4 and 2 - 4 ti sites , respectively ) they are remarkably different for the ( a)-chain ( 3.11 and 2.79   between 3 - 3 and 1 - 3 ti sites ) .",

    "further gradation of red and blue on light and dark subsets indicates inequivalent ti sites in ( a ) and ( b ) chains . ]",
    "accurate determination of the crystal structure allowed to elucidate the nature of the three phases distinguished by the two first - order transitions.@xcite in particular , in the metallic phase the average ti - o bond lengths for crystallographically inequivalent tio@xmath26 octahedra are very similar which results in the average valence state of 3.5 + per each ti cation . below 130k charge has been transferred from the ( b ) to the ( a)-chains .",
    "in addition , ti@xmath5 cations in alternate ( a)-chains are paired to form nonmagnetic metal - metal bonds , whereas in the intermediate phase pairing also persists but its long - range order calls for a fivefold supercell.@xcite thus , the 130 - 140k transition is associated with a transition to the phase with a long - range order of ti@xmath5-ti@xmath5 pairs , whereas above 150 k 3 + and 4 + ti cations are disordered .",
    "the presence of the ti@xmath5-ti@xmath5 pairs strongly differentiates ti@xmath0o@xmath1 from fe@xmath10o@xmath0 and results in two steep first - order transitions found in the electrical resistivity .",
    "recent lda band structure calculations of both high- and low - temperature phase of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 results in significant @xmath4 charge separation between crystallographically independent 3 + and 4 + ti sites in the low - temperature phase , whereas a rather isotropic occupation of the @xmath4 states has been found at room - temperature.@xcite while , in addition , an orbital order at the ti @xmath27 chains originating from metal - metal dimerization was found , the lda gave only metallic solution with semimetallic - like band overlap instead of the semiconducting gap .",
    "this problem is overcome in our work taking into account strong electronic correlations in ti @xmath3 shell using the lda+@xmath2 method .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the electronic structure of the low - temperature phase using the lda+@xmath2 approach in the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) calculation scheme.@xcite the lda+@xmath2 calculations result in a charge and orbitally ordered insulator with an energy gap of 0.29ev , which is in a good agreement with an experimental gap value of 0.25ev . from our results ,",
    "we propose an orbital order parameter , defined as the difference between @xmath4 majority / minority spin occupancies of ti(1)@xmath5/ti(3)@xmath5 and ti(2)@xmath6/ti(4)@xmath6 cations , respectively .",
    "this order parameter is found to be quite large , although the total @xmath3 charge difference between 3 + and 4 + cations , remains small .",
    "also it is interesting to note that the total charge separation between 3 + and 4 + ti cations completely is lost due to efficient screening by the rearrangement of the other ti electrons .",
    "in addition , we find a strong antiferromagnetic coupling of @xmath28k of the local moments within the dimerized ti@xmath5-ti@xmath5 pairs , whereas an inter - pair coupling is only of @xmath29k .",
    "this is in a good agreement with small and temperature independent magnetic susceptibility in the low - temperature phase of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the present band - structure calculations have been performed for the low - temperature triclinic structure of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite the @xmath30 unit cell used in the calculations was constructed from the translation vectors of the original @xmath31 cell with @xmath32  , @xmath33  , @xmath34  , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 found at 115k .",

    "fifteen kinds of empty spheres were introduced to fill up the inter - atomic space .",
    "for simplicity we neglect small spin - orbit coupling and consider only a collinear spin case .",
    "our lsda band structure calculations for the low - temperature @xmath30 structure confirmed the results of the previous work.@xcite the lsda gives a nonmagnetic metallic solution with substantial charge separation between crystallographically independent ti(1)/ti(3 ) and ti(2)/ti(4 ) cations .",
    "the lower part of the valence band below -3ev is predominantly formed by o @xmath41 states with a bonding hybridization with ti @xmath3 states .",
    "crystal field splitting of the latter is roughly of 2.5ev .",
    "ti @xmath4 states form the group of bands at and up to 2 ev above the fermi energy whereas ti @xmath42 states give a predominant contribution to the bands between 2.5 and 4.5ev . within",
    "the @xmath21 group of bands the symmetry inequivalence of ti(1)/ti(3 ) and ti(2)/ti(4 ) sites leads to substantial @xmath4 charge separation between these two groups of ti atoms .",
    "in addition , an analysis of the partial density of states reveals significant bonding - antibonding splitting of @xmath9 ( in local cubic frame ) states of about 1.5ev for ti(1)/ti(3 ) cations , whereas ti(2)/ti(4 ) cations show a relatively weak substructure .",
    "this substantial bonding - antibonding splitting of ti(1)/ti(3 ) @xmath4 states agrees well with the concept of formation of ti@xmath5-ti@xmath5 spin - singlet pairs proposed earlier by marezio.@xcite however , the lsda calculations fail to reproduce an insulating spin - singlet ground state of the low - temperature phase of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "apparently , the electron - electron correlations , mainly in the @xmath3 shell of ti cations , play a significant role .",
    "in order to take into account strong electronic correlations in ti @xmath3 shell we perform lda+@xmath2 calculations for ti@xmath0o@xmath1 in the low - temperature @xmath30 structure . in our calculations we use coulomb intereaction parameter @xmath43ev and exchange coupling @xmath44ev taken in agreement with previous constrained lda calculations.@xcite",
    "the lda+@xmath2 calculations result in a charge and orbitally ordered insulator with an energy gap of 0.29ev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ldau ] ) .",
    "this is in a strong contrast to the metallic solution with a substantial charge disproportionation between crystallographically inequivalent ti(1)/ti(3 ) and ti(2)/ti(4 ) cations obtained by lsda and in a reasonably good agreement with an experimental gap value of 0.25ev .",
    "note , however , that the charge and orbital order pattern remains exactly the same for @xmath2 in the range 2.5 - 4.5ev , whereas the energy gap increases considerably up to 1.12ev for @xmath2=4.5ev .",
    "this remarkable increase of the gap value is accompanied by the enhancement of the spin magnetic moment from 0.56 up to 0.8 @xmath45 per 3 + ti(1)/ti(3 ) cation as @xmath2 is increased from 2.5 to 4.5ev .",
    "in addition , we perform lda+@xmath2 calculations for high - temperature metallic phase of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 . in particular for @xmath2 of 2.5ev a metallic self - consistent solution with substantial density of states ( 76 states / ry ) at the fermi level has been found , whereas for @xmath2 of 3ev the lda+@xmath2 solution becomes unstable but remains metallic . with further increase of the @xmath2 value",
    "the metallic solution collapses into insulating one .",
    "the total dos obtained from lda+@xmath2 calculations with @xmath2=3.0ev and @xmath46=0.8ev for the low - temperature @xmath30 phase of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

    "thus , one of @xmath4 majority / minority spin states of ti(1)/ti(3 ) becomes occupied @xmath47 , whereas all other @xmath4 states are pushed by strong coulomb interaction above the fermi level .",
    "in contrast , all @xmath4 states of ti(2 ) and ti(4 ) are almost depopulated @xmath48 and form bands up to 2.5ev above the fermi level .",
    "the occupied ti(1)/ti(3 ) states are strongly localized and form a prominent structure with a band width of 0.25ev just below the fermi level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ldau - pdos ] ) .",
    "the strong coulomb interaction does not affect much the empty ti @xmath42 states , which give predominant contribution between 2.5 and 4.5ev .",
    "the obtained magnetic structure is almost antiferromagnetic with the spin magnetic moments within ti(1)@xmath5-ti(3)@xmath5 as well as ti(2)@xmath6-ti(4)@xmath6 pairs being of the same magnitude with opposite sign .     the partial dos for ti(1)@xmath5 and ti(2)@xmath6 cations are shown .",

    "as shown in table  [ tab : occ ] , one of the @xmath4 states of ti@xmath5 cations @xmath47 is occupied with the occupation number of 0.74 , whereas the remaining two @xmath4 orbitals have a significantly smaller population of about 0.08 .",
    "thus , according to ref .",
    "we define an orbital order parameter as the largest difference between 3 + and 4 + ti @xmath4 populations which amounts to 66% of ideal ionic charge ordering model .",
    "the orbital order parameter clearly shows the existence of substantial charge disproportionation in the ti 3@xmath49 shell of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 which is remarkable because of the complete lack of the total charge separation ( see column @xmath50 in table  [ tab : occ ] ) between 3 + and 4 + ti cations .",
    "the occupation matrices analysis shows that the change of the @xmath4 occupations is very efficiently screened by the rearrangement of the other ti electrons .",
    "a significant portion of the screening charge is provided by ti @xmath42 states due to formation of relatively strong @xmath51 bonds with o @xmath41 states , which results in appreciable contribution of the former to the occupied part of the valence band .",
    "ti @xmath7 and @xmath8 states give additional contributions to the screening of the difference in @xmath4 occupations which leads to complete loss of the disproportionation between the charges at 3 + and 4 + ti sites .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition , hopping matrix elements were evaluated via fourier transformation from reciprocal to real space of the ti @xmath4 lda wannier hamiltonian.@xcite remarkably , for the low - temperature phase the ti(1)-ti(3 ) intra - pair @xmath9-@xmath9 hopping matrix element is found to be of 0.61 ev , whereas all other hoppings are 3 - 4 times smaller .",
    "this strong inhomogeneity of the hopping matrix elements disappears in the high - temperature phase .",
    "thus , according to our calculations hopping elements in the high - temperature phase are 0.23 , 0.21 , 0.39 , and 0.33 ev between 1 - 3 , 2 - 4 , 3 - 3 , and 4 - 4 ti sites , respectively .",
    "estimation of exchange interaction parameters via the variation of the ground state energy with respect to the magnetic moment rotation angle@xcite results in a strong antiferromagnetic coupling of -1696k between ti(1)@xmath5 and ti(3)@xmath5 cations.@xcite all other couplings are two orders of magnitudes smaller .",
    "this indicates a possible formation of the spin - singlet pairs via direct antiferromagnetic exchange between neighboring ti(1 ) and ti(3 ) sites .",
    "the contribution of the superexchange via o @xmath57 orbitals to the ti(1)-ti(3 ) exchange coupling is found to be negligible .",
    "this was verified by calculating the exchange coupling constants with the sub - blocks of the lmto hamiltonian responsible for the ti - o hybridization being set to zero .",
