    "pulsars are very stable rotators . however , many pulsars exhibit significant timing irregularities , i.e. , unpredicted arrival times of pulses .",
    "there are two main types of timing irregularities , namely ` timing noise ' which is consisted of low - frequency quasi - periodic structures , and ` glitches ' which are abrupt increases in their spin rates followed by relaxations .",
    "glitch activities are more frequent in relatively young pulsars with a characteristic age of @xmath13  yr ( shemar & lyne 1996 ; wang et al . 2000 ) . for the hundreds of glitches",
    "observed , their typical fractional jumps in spin frequency @xmath0 are in the range of @xmath14 , and their relative increment in frequency derivative is @xmath15 . despite the abundance of observational data accumulated for over @xmath16 years , we are still far from satisfactory understanding of glitch events .",
    "traditional models mainly involve the expected superfluid nature of part of the neutron star interior ( anderson & itoh 1975 ; ruderman 1976 ) , and the angular momentum is carried in the form of microscopic , quantized vortices , whose density determines the rotation rate of a pulsar .",
    "mostly , these vortices are pinned to the crust and the charged matter in the core of the star , thus their outward drifting motions are prevented ( anderson & itoh 1975 ; alpar 1977 ; pines et al .",
    "1980 ; alpar et al .",
    "1981 ; anderson et al . 1982 )",
    "however , as the crust spins down due to the electromagnetic braking , a rotational lag and stress ( magnus force ) gradually builds up .",
    "a glitch occurs when the stress reaches some critical value and the pinning breaks , vortices suddenly move outward and impart their angular momentum to the crust . immediately after the glitch ,",
    "the vortices are pinned to other parts again and the superfluid is effectively decoupled from the crust .",
    "following the seminal work of baym , pethick & pines ( 1969 ) , there are two classes of models that have been developed to explore the dynamical evolution of pinned superfluid during the post - glitch recovery .",
    "one kind of models involve a weak coupling between the superfluid and the crust due to the interaction between free vortices and the coulomb lattice of nuclei ( jones 1990 , 1992 , 1998 ) .",
    "another kind of models assume that the vortices creep rate is highly temperature - dependent .",
    "as the vortices creep through the crust , angular momentum is gradually transferred ( alpar 1984a , 1984b ; link , epstein & baym 1993 ; larson & link 2002 ) .",
    "superfluid vortex dynamics can model the relaxation well ; however , there are still many significant problems unsolved .",
    "for instance , the mechanism that triggers the glitch in the first place and the detailed processes of angular momentum transfer during the recovery are still controversial .",
    "it has been suggested that such an event may be triggered by large temperature perturbations ( link & epstein 1996 ) , or caused by starquakes ( baym & pines 1971 ; cheng et al .",
    "1992 ) , or the interactions of the proton vortices and the crustal magnetic field ( sedrakian & cordes 1999 ) , or the superfluid r - mode instability ( andersson , comer , & prix 2003 ; glampedakis & andersson 2009 ) .",
    "very recently , pizzochero ( 2011 ) proposed an analytic model for angular momentum transfer associated with vela - like glitches for the storage and release of superfluid vorticity , and seveso et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and haskell et al .",
    "( 2013 ) extended the model to realistic equations of state and relativistic backgrounds .",
    "haskell et al . ( 2012 ) further modeled all stages of vela glitches with a two - fluid hydrodynamical approach .",
    "furthermore , haskell & antonopoulou ( 2013 ) showed that if glitches are indeed due to large scale unpinning of superfluid vortices , the different regions in which the unpinning occurs and the respective timescales on which they recouple can lead to various observed jump and relaxation signatures .",
    "however , by combining the latest observational data for prolific glitching pulsars with theoretical results for the crust entrainment , andersson et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that the required superfluid reservoir exceeds that available in the crust .",
    "coincidentally , chamel ( 2013 ) found that the glitches observed in the vela pulsar require an additional reservoir of angular momentum , since the maximum amount of angular momentum that can possibly be transferred during glitches is severely limited by the non - dissipative entrainment effects .",
    "this challenges superfluid vortex model of the glitch phenomenon . besides , some of the glitch events , such as those with persistent offset in the spin - down rate of the crab pulsar following the 1975 glitch is difficult to explain with the dynamic coupling between the crust and the superfluid interior .",
    "an alternative explanation of the observed frequency deficit is an increase in the external torque caused by a rearrangement of the stellar magnetic field ( link 1992 , 1998 ) .",
    "observationally , many pulsar phenomena , including the mode changing , pulsar - shape variability and spin - down rates switching , are caused by changes in pulsar s magnetosphere ( lyne et al .",
    "thus these relaxation processes may also be produced by the magnetosphere activities , which are induced by initial starquakes .",
    "it has also been observed in recent years that some pulsars ( e.g. psr j1825 - 0935 and psr j1835 - 1106 ) show another type of irregularity characterized by a gradual increase in @xmath0 , accompanied by a rapid decrease in @xmath17 and subsequent exponential increase back to its initial value ( zou et al .",
    "2004 ; shabanova 2005 ) . that is the so - called ` slow glitch ' . currently , there is still no convincing theoretical understanding for slow glitches .",
    "peng & xu ( 2008 ) proposed that , after a collapse or a small star - quake , the solid superficial layer of a rigid quark star may be heated and becomes a viscous fluid , which will eventually produce a gradual increase in @xmath0 . however , hobbs et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and lyne et al .",
    "( 2010 ) argued that the slow glitches have the same origin as the timing noise of many pulsars .",
    "for the recovery processes of both glitch and slow glitch events , the variations of spin frequency @xmath0 and its first derivative @xmath18 of pulsars are obtained from polynomial fit results of arriving time epochs of pulses .",
    "the local toas of the mean pulses for individual observing sessions are determined from the maximum cross correlation between the observed mean pulses and a gaussian profile template .",
    "the profile template is a mean pulse with high signal - to - noise ratio , obtained by summing the best - quality mean pulses over several observing sessions .",
    "correction of toas to the solar system barycenter can be done using tempo2 program with the jet propulsion laboratory de405 ephemeris ( standish 1998 ) .",
    "these toas are then weighted by the inverse squares of their estimated uncertainty .",
    "since the rotational period is nearly constant , these observable quantities , @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be obtained by fitting the phases to the third order of its taylor expansion over a time span @xmath20 , @xmath21    one can thus get the values of @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 at @xmath22 from fitting to equation  ( 1 ) for independent @xmath23 data blocks around @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath24 . apparently , these observational quantities obtained this way are not instantaneous results , rather , the `` averaged '' results over each data block ( i.e. over each @xmath20 ) and extrapolated to @xmath22 , which are not necessarily the same as the instantaneous values ( denoted as @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus , they are called `` averaged '' values ( denoted as @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) in this work .",
    "usually , @xmath20 is much less than pulsar s spin - down age @xmath29 , thus the differences between instantaneous values and `` averaged '' values are not significant , and consequently @xmath30 and @xmath28 are good approximations for @xmath31 and @xmath32 in most cases .",
    "however , it has been found recently that oscillations of the  apparent \" magnetic fields of neutron stars are responsible for the observed signs and magnitudes of @xmath19 , the second derivative of frequency , and braking indices ( biryukov et al .",
    "2012 ; pons et al .",
    "2012 ; zhang & xie 2012a , 2012b ) .",
    "we further suggested that the oscillation time scales are between 10 - 100 yr , comparable to @xmath20 , thus making the fitted spin - down parameters different from the true and instantaneous spin - down parameters .",
    "similarly , considerable biases may also exist when fitting the glitch recovery data , since the glitch recovery time scales are also comparable with @xmath20 .    in section 2 ,",
    "we simulate several pulsar timing data analysis procedures for glitch recoveries , and find that the glitch parameters , obtained from the averaged @xmath27 and @xmath28 , have significant systematic biases compared with that obtained with the instantaneous @xmath25 and @xmath32 . in order to get the true glitch parameters with the reported , yet averaged glitch recovery data @xmath33 and @xmath34 , a phenomenological or physical glitch model is needed to be combined with simulations .",
    "we thus present a phenomenological spin - down model during a glitch recovery , and model several slow glitch recovery events and the recovery of a giant classical glitch in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we test four fitting procedures based on the phenomenological spin - down model and find that the best method is taking a very high order polynomial to fit the phase and then taking its derivatives to obtain @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in section 5 , we discuss how to obtain the model parameters of glitch recoveries more accurately .",
    "the results are summarized in section 6 .",
    "by fitting the toa set @xmath35 to equation ( [ phase ] ) , one can get @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath36 and @xmath37 show exponential relaxations , their variations following the jump at epoch @xmath38 can be described as the following empirical functions ( e.g. yuan et al .",
    "2010 , roy et al .",
    "2012 ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are permanent changes in @xmath0 and @xmath1 relative to the pre - glitch solution @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the amplitude of the @xmath47th decaying component with a time constant @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "one can get the glitch parameters @xmath42 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath46 , @xmath52 and @xmath7 by fitting @xmath10 and @xmath11 to equations  ( [ relaxation ] ) and ( [ relaxation2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the two functions describe the post - glitch behaviors fairly well , especially for the case of a long term recovery , and usually multiple decay terms with different decay time constants can be fitted ( e.g. there are up to five exponentials are fitted for vela 2000 and 2004 glitches ; dodson et al .",
    "2002 , 2007 ) .",
    "for simplicity , the cases that @xmath0 varies as one exponential decay term or two exponential decay terms are assumed in the following simulations .    *",
    "slow glitches are characterized by a gradual increase in @xmath0 with a long time scale of several months , accompanied by a rapid decrease in @xmath17 by a few percent , which is sometimes even shorter than the observation interval and thus can not be seen .",
    "then @xmath17 experiences an exponential increase back to its initial value with the same time scale as that of @xmath0 increase ( shabanova 2005 ) .",
    "* analogous to the classical glitches , we suggest that the slow glitches can be described by the following two functions : @xmath53 and @xmath54 where the parameters are the same as those in equations ( [ relaxation ] ) and ( [ relaxation2 ] ) .",
    "since the glitch or slow glitch recoveries can be described by equations ( [ relaxation])-([srelaxation2 ] ) , some simple models can also be derived from them . for a classical glitch , we simply assume @xmath55 i.e. , @xmath56 . we will use this equation to produce simulated data , and obtain the `` instantaneous '' @xmath57 and @xmath58 , with the parameters ( @xmath59 and @xmath7 ) given later . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` averaged '' values are obtained by the following procedure .",
    "firstly , we get the phase by @xmath60 . for convenience",
    "we take @xmath61",
    ". however , in practice @xmath12 can not be known precisely due to discontinuous observations ; we will show later that this will cause some uncertainty in estimating the parameters of a classical glitch , but not so for slow glitches .",
    "we assume a certain time interval @xmath62 between each two nearby toas , i.e. @xmath63 is a constant .",
    "we set ten adjacent toas in one block ( i.e. @xmath64 in equation  ( [ phase ] ) ) , and the latter five toas are used as the first five toas in the next block .",
    "we then fit the toa blocks to equation  ( [ phase ] ) to obtain @xmath27 and @xmath65 , which are the fitted coefficients of @xmath0 term and @xmath1 term of the equation , respectively .",
    "the time @xmath22 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 is taken as the middle epoch of each block , i.e. , @xmath66 , and is also `` averaged '' ( e.g. yuan et al . 2010 ) .    in figure  [ fig:0 ] , we show these instantaneous values and averaged values with different @xmath62 for a glitch with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "one can see that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 have remarkably different decay profiles from @xmath25 and @xmath32 during the recovery process , respectively .",
    "this systematic biases are independent of @xmath69 , and it seems that the recovery time - scale @xmath7 is the key parameter that is mainly biased . by fitting @xmath27 and @xmath28 to equation  ( [ relaxation ] ) and equation  ( [ relaxation2 ] ) , respectively ,",
    "we find that all the recovery time scales of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are much longer than the time scale of @xmath70  days ( e.g. @xmath71 day for @xmath72 s ) . the systematic differences between the decay profiles of @xmath27 or @xmath28 and the profile of @xmath25 or @xmath32 are considerable , and apparently caused by the procedure of fitting toas to equation  ( [ phase ] ) ; thus for higher order fits , one can not consider the first order coefficient to be the  frequency \" . _",
    "this procedure is thus abandoned for glitch data analysis in the following . _     ( upper panel ) and @xmath1 ( bottom panel ) for a simulated classical glitch with _",
    "one decay term_. solid lines represent their instantaneous values ; circles , triangles , and crosses represent the averaged values obtained by fitting the simulated toas to equation  ( [ phase ] ) for the cases of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75  s , respectively . ]",
    "however with the tempo2 software , @xmath0 may be obtained from the toas by fitting to @xmath76 and @xmath1 may be obtained by fitting to @xmath77 i.e. the first two or three terms of equations  ( [ phase ] ) , respectively ( yu 2013 ) . here",
    ", we first fit the toa blocks to equation  ( [ phase2 ] ) to obtain @xmath27 , which is the fitted coefficients of @xmath0 term of equation  ( [ phase2 ] ) .",
    "we then separately fit the toa blocks to equation  ( [ phase3 ] ) to obtain @xmath78 , which is the fitted coefficients of @xmath1 term of equation  ( [ phase3 ] ) . in the left panels of figure  [ fig:1 ]",
    ", we show the instantaneous and averaged values obtained this way , with different @xmath62 for a glitch with the same @xmath79 and @xmath7 .",
    "clearly now the profiles of both @xmath27 and @xmath28 follow that of @xmath25 and @xmath32 without obvious distortions . by fitting to equation  ( [ relaxation ] ) or equation  ( [ relaxation2 ] )",
    ", we find that all the recovery time scales of @xmath27 or @xmath28 equal the time scale of @xmath70  days , i.e. @xmath7 has not been biased .",
    "we can then obtain the normally reported glitch parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 , as listed in table [ tab:1 ] , by fitting @xmath81 or @xmath82 to equation  ( [ relaxation ] ) or equation  ( [ relaxation2 ] ) with different @xmath62 ; for comparison we also list @xmath79 and @xmath80 obtained from @xmath25 and @xmath32 .",
    "one can see that `` averaged '' @xmath79 or @xmath83 ( denoted as @xmath84 or @xmath85 hereafter ) have systematic differences from instantaneous @xmath79 or @xmath83 ( denoted as @xmath86 or @xmath87 hereafter ) . for @xmath88 ,",
    "the differences are tiny and the glitch parameters can be restored satisfactorily ; however , for @xmath89 , both the `` averaged '' @xmath79 and @xmath83 may be considerably smaller than the instantaneous @xmath79 and @xmath83 , respectively .    for a slow glitch , we assume @xmath90 where @xmath61 and @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "after the jump , the classical glitch recoveries ( represented by solid line ) generally have @xmath0 variation that tends to restore its initial values , and usually the restoration is composed by a exponential decay and a permanent linear decrease with slope @xmath43 ; however , for slow glitches ( represented by dashed line ) , @xmath0 monotonically increases , as shown in panel ( 1 ) . in panel ( 2 ) , @xmath1 of classical glitch recoveries that tends to restore its initial values , but can not completely recover for @xmath275 ; @xmath1 of slow glitch recoveries almost completely recover to its initial value , corresponding to the increase of @xmath0 .    in sections 3 and 4 ,",
    "we have shown that the classical and slow glitch recoveries can be well modeled by a simple function , @xmath276 , with positive or negative @xmath6 , as shown in panel ( 3 ) , respectively .",
    "however , it is should be noticed that the model only have two parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , from which we can obtain @xmath79 and @xmath80 , but not @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are not modelled .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that the major difference between slow glitch and classical glitch recoveries are that they show opposite trends with opposite signs of @xmath6 , in our phenomenological model .",
    "in this work we studied the data analysis procedures of pulsar s glitch observations and found the conventionally used methods produce biases to the true glitch parameters with varying degrees .",
    "we presented a phenomenological model for the recovery processes of classical and slow glitches , which is used to model successfully the observed slow and classical glitch events from pulsars b182209 and psr b2334 + 61 , respectively .",
    "based on the model , we tested four different data analysis procedures .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the timing analysis method of fitting the observed toas with equation  ( [ phase2 ] ) or equation  ( [ phase3 ] ) results in significant biases to glitch parameters of variation magnitude , as shown in figures  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] , and table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the biases can be ignored only when @xmath277  s ; otherwise biases still exist to some extend .",
    "2 .   with equation ( [ phase4 ] )",
    ", one can obtain the glitch parameters by fitting the phase directly , which produce relatively smaller biases .",
    "however , for the case with multiple decay terms , the timescales are usually fixed by eye for their initial values , which may introduce strong biases .",
    "we propose a phenomenological model of glitch recovery ( equation  ( [ rredipole ] ) ) , which can reproduce the commonly observed exponential glitch recovery profiles . the recovery processes of both slow and classical glitches can be explained as the @xmath278 with @xmath8 ( figure  [ fig:3 ] ) or @xmath9 ( figure  [ fig:4][fig:6 ] ) , respectively .",
    "their opposite trends and main characteristics are illustrated in figure  [ fig:7 ] .",
    "4 .   based on the phenomenological model ,",
    "we simulate four fitting procedures and find that the best one is taking a very high order polynomial to fit the phase and then taking its derivatives to obtain @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ". then the glitch parameters can be obtained from @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( e.g. fitting @xmath11 to equation ( [ relaxation2 ] ) ) .",
    "we suggest that this procedure should be used in pulsar timing analysis .",
    "the uncertainty in the starting time ( @xmath12 ) of a classical glitch causes uncertainties to the glitch parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( equation [ sigma ] ) , but less so to a slow glitch and @xmath12 of a slow glitch can be determined from data .    however our phenomenological model can not account for the non - recoverable jumps in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are observed for some classical glitches and",
    "may be due to the permanent increase of a pulsar s dipole magnetic field due to glitches ( lin & zhang 2004 ) . in the work , we also assumed uniform toa distributions to simulate both the slow and classical glitch recoveries , since the observed toas are not reported in literature .",
    "the glitch parameters can be better restored , if the observed toas are available and fitted directly with a glitch model ; this is actually generally desired for pulsar timing studies . thus we suggest that toas should be made available to the community when possible or that the full fitting procedure and fit parameters for different epochs made available .",
    "also theorists could try to calculate phase as an output , thus making the comparison more accurate .",
