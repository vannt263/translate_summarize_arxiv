    "stable quantum mechanical states are characterized by one real number  the energy @xmath1 or , in the relativistic case , the mass @xmath2  in addition to definite values of discrete quantum numbers @xmath3 such as charge , isospin ( particle species labels ) and by angular momentum or spin ( parity ) @xmath4 .",
    "quasistable states @xmath5 are characterized by a pair of real numbers , in addition to the same discrete quantum numbers .",
    "for these two numbers one takes either energy and width @xmath6 or energy and inverse lifetime @xmath7 depending upon the way these quantities can be measured . in the relativistic case one takes mass and width @xmath8 or mass and ( inverse ) lifetime @xmath9 .",
    "lifetime @xmath10 and its inverse @xmath11 , the initial decay rate of the decay @xmath12 for any decay channel @xmath13 are measured by fits of the experimental counting rate @xmath14 to the exponential law for the partial decay rate @xmath15 : @xmath16 ( here @xmath15 are the theoretical partial decay rates of the decay @xmath17 for any decay channel @xmath13 and @xmath18 is the number of decay products @xmath13 registered in the detector during the time interval @xmath19 around @xmath20 ) .    in contrast , the width @xmath21 is measured by fits of the cross section for the resonance scattering process @xmath22 to the lorentzian ( breit - wigner ) energy distribution @xmath23    ( plus usually some background term @xmath24 ) .",
    "decay rate @xmath25 and resonance width @xmath21 are thus different quantities , @xmath26 is connected with the exponential time evolution , and @xmath21 is connected with the lorentzian energy distribution .",
    "but usually one does not even distinguish between @xmath27 and the width @xmath21 ; one identifies @xmath28 with @xmath21 @xmath29 and uses the words rate and width for either of them .",
    "often one calls a quasistable state a resonance , if the energy @xmath30 ( or resonance mass @xmath31 ) can be measured from .",
    "this is the case when @xmath32 are @xmath33 .",
    "and one calls the quasistable state a decaying particle when the lifetime @xmath34 can be determined experimentally from , which is usually for values of @xmath35 .    in non - relativistic physics",
    "the relation was justified by the wigner - weisskopf approximation @xcite , which is really not an approximation of standard quantum mechanics ( based on the hilbert space axiom ) , because in hilbert space @xmath36 there is no state vector @xmath37 whose rate for the born probability @xmath38 @xmath39 obeys the exponential law .",
    "recently a non - relativistic theory which fulfills @xmath40 has been constructed using a slight modification of the standard hilbert space axiom @xcite .",
    "however in non - relativistic physics there was never much doubt that resonances are not qualitatively different from decaying states but only quantitatively by their value of width @xmath41 .",
    "the equality has recently also been confirmed in atomic physics @xcite .    in relativistic physics ,",
    "the situation is quite different .",
    "based on the perturbation theoretical definition by the self - energy of the propagators , resonances and decaying states are considered as complicated objects that can not be described as an exponentially decaying state or as a state characterized by two numbers like @xmath42 .",
    "this has recently led to some difficulties with the definition of mass and width of the @xmath43-boson @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss here the possibility that also _ relativistic _ resonances and decaying states are qualitatively the same , described by representations of poincar transformations , similarly to wigner s theory of relativistic stable particles @xcite .",
    "this will lead to a relativistic gamow vector which has a `` relativistic breit - wigner '' energy distribution and an exponential decay law fulfilling .",
    "this relativistic gamow vector and/or the corresponding relativistic breit - wigner will represent the resonance per se ( without background ) .",
    "it provides the means to precisely define a relativistic resonance and separate the scattering amplitude into a background and the resonance amplitude in an unambiguous way , and therewith define the mass and width of a relativistic resonance .",
    "in section  [ sec2 ] we review the non - relativistic theory and introduce the hardy space hypothesis which replaces the hilbert space axiom of quantum mechanics .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] reviews scattering theory and presents its minor variations based on the new hardy space hypothesis .",
    "the relativistic theory of scattering is presented in section  [ sec4 ] , and section  [ sec5 ] gives a detailed derivation of the relativistic gamow vector from the @xmath0-matrix pole .",
    "some of its properties are deduced here .",
    "the transformation of the relativistic gamow vectors under ( causal ) poincar transformations and its consequences are the subject of the subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "in the non - relativistic phenomenological description of quasistable and stable states , one has two alternative descriptions : the s - matrix description and the hamiltonian description @xcite .    in the s - matrix description the partial s - matrix element with angular momentum @xmath44 ( the @xmath44-th partial s - matrix @xmath45 ) is an analytic function on a riemann energy surface cut along the real positive axis from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "the s - matrix is written in terms of the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath48 and the reaction amplitude @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the quantum numbers of the initial state and the elastic channel and @xmath13 denote the reaction channels .    if one has a hamiltonian given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is selfadjoint and semi - bounded ( stability of matter ) by @xmath54 , then the s - matrix and hamiltonian description are related and the scattering amplitude is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 are eigenkets of the exact hamiltonian with real ( continuous ) eigenvalues @xmath57 , angular momentum @xmath44 , and other quantum numbers indicated by @xmath58 .",
    "the superscript ( @xmath59 ) indicates that they are solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equation fulfilling outgoing boundary conditions ( @xmath60 in the denominator ) .",
    "the @xmath61 are eigenkets of the free hamiltonian @xmath62 .",
    "a stable state is , in the s - matrix description , a pole at @xmath63 on the _ first _ sheet of the riemann surface .",
    "whereas in the hamiltonian description , a stable state is an eigenvector with a real discrete eigenvalue corresponding to the equation , @xmath64    an unstable particle , in the s - matrix description , is related to a pole at @xmath65 on the _ second _ sheet of the riemann surface .",
    "if there is just one resonance with angular momentum @xmath44 in the @xmath13-channel then @xmath66 where the `` physical '' values of e are @xmath67 .    in the hamiltonian description ,",
    "since the selfadjoint operator @xmath53 of ( [ ee ] ) can not have a complex eigenvalue @xmath68 , one devises an `` effective '' , complex hamiltonian matrix @xmath69 and the decaying state is an eigenvector of @xmath69 with a complex eigenvalue @xmath70 for example , in the neutral kaon theory , one has two such eigenvectors @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73 since the definition ( [ hdescription ] ) is mathematically problematic because it requires the justification of a finite dimensional complex submatrix for a selfadjoint operator @xmath53 , the definition ( [ sdescription ] ) of a resonance as a pole of the s - matrix has become the most universal definition of a resonance state .    a complex eigenvalue of a self - adjoint hamiltonian , @xmath53 is not possible for a vector in the hilbert space @xmath74 , thus to obtain something like @xmath75 in ( [ hdescription ] ) , one must go outside the hilbert space .",
    "this should not be surprising because dirac kets ( generalized eigenvectors with eigenvalues from the continuous real energy spectrum ) are also not elements of @xmath74 , and to give them a mathematically rigorous foundation , one has to use a rigged hilbert space(rhs ) ( see appendix  [ r ] ) .",
    "the ordinary dirac eigenkets @xmath76 of @xmath62 are usually taken from the rhs , @xmath77 , where the realization of @xmath78 is given by the schwartz space @xmath0 , which is the space of smooth functions rapidly decreasing at infinity .",
    "this means that every vector @xmath79 ( with fixed value of @xmath44 and the other quantum numbers @xmath13 ) , can be represented according to the dirac basis vector expansion ( nuclear spectral theorem ) in terms of the @xmath80 as @xmath81 where the energy wave functions @xmath82 are schwartz space functions : @xmath83    to obtain generalized eigenvectors that fulfill something like ( [ hdescription ] ) one follows the same rhs method but one uses in place of the schwartz space @xmath78 , other spaces @xmath84 and @xmath85 which are realized by hardy functions as explained next .",
    "the eigenkets of the exact hamiltonian @xmath86 that one uses in scattering theory are not ordinary dirac kets , i.e. elements of the dual of the schwartz space @xmath87 , but they are kets which also have meaning for complex values @xmath88 with infinitesimal @xmath89 . in scattering theory ,",
    "one uses two solutions of the eigenvalue equation @xmath90 where the superscript @xmath91 refers to the @xmath92 in the denominator of the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "this indicates that @xmath93 must be continued from the real energies into an @xmath94 -strip of the complex energy plane : into the lower half plane for ( @xmath59 ) and into the upper half plane for ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "this means the complex conjugate of the wave functions , @xmath96 , must not only be a smooth function of @xmath57 like in ( [ schwartz - energy ] ) but they must also be functions that have an analytic continuation into the complex energy plane , in particular @xmath97 must have an analytic continuation into the lower half plane .",
    "hardy functions , elements of @xmath98 have this property .",
    "thus we take for the energy wavefunctions of a scattering system    [ hardy_wave ] @xmath99    this is a new hypothesis which replaces the hilbert space axiom @xmath100 or the schwartz space assumption .",
    "the generalized eigenvectors ( [ lippmann - schwinger ] ) representing out ( @xmath59 ) and in ( @xmath95 ) plane wave solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equation are therefore kets in a pair of rigged hilbert spaces : @xmath101 this means the vectors @xmath102 are given by the dirac basis vector expansion    [ vector_expansion ] @xmath103 where the energy wave functions @xmath104 are hardy functions analytic in the upper - half plane and the vectors @xmath105 are given by the dirac basis vector expansion @xmath106    where the @xmath107 are elements of @xmath108 .",
    "in the scattering experiment , the @xmath109 represent the out - states registered by a detector and the @xmath110 represent the in - states prepared by a preparation apparatus ( e.g. accelerator ) , as will be discussed in section  [ sec3 ] .    in the heuristic formulation using the lippmann - schwinger equations @xcite , the precise mathematical meaning of the out and in plane wave solutions",
    "is usually not stated .",
    "it is understood that they are to provide a means to distinguish between in - states @xmath111 prepared in the past , and out - states @xmath112 registered by the detector in the future after they have passed the interaction region .",
    "such a distinction is meaningless in the hilbert space where only time symmetric solutions of the schrodinger or heisenberg equation- given by the unitary time evolution group- are allowed .",
    "thus there is a contradiction between the hilbert space axiom of quantum theory and the distinction between in- and out- states in scattering theory . since the solutions to the lippmann - schwinger equation are kets @xmath113 , they are not elements of the hilbert space , and one can choose them to be two solutions of the same eigenvalue equation with two different , time asymmetric , boundary conditions .",
    "this is precisely what we intend to do @xcite .",
    "we replace the axiom of orthodox von neumann quantum mechanics , which asserts that the set of prepared in - states and the set of detected observables ( or out - states ) are both equivalent to the hilbert space @xmath114 by a new axiom .",
    "this axiom states that the prepared states , defined by the preparation apparatus ( accelerator ) , are described by @xmath115 and the registered observables , defined by the registration apparatus ( detector ) are described by @xmath116 where @xmath74 in ( [ phi+ ] ) and ( [ phi- ] ) denotes the same hilbert space but @xmath85 and @xmath84 are the two different hardy spaces which are dense in @xmath74 . for the non - relativistic case",
    "this axiom is a formulation of time asymmetric boundary conditions for the solutions of the time symmetric schrodinger and the heisenberg differential equations , respectively .",
    "it is correct , as stated in section 3.2 of @xcite , that in - states @xmath111 and out - states @xmath112 do not inhabit two different hilbert spaces .",
    "however , in contrast to what is implied in @xcite , the new hypothesis ( [ phi+ ] ) , ( [ phi- ] ) postulates that the in- and out- kets ( [ lippmann - schwinger ] ) , which are generalized eigenvectors and not in @xmath74 , are from _ two _ different spaces @xmath117 , because ( [ phi+ ] ) , ( [ phi- ] ) postulates that the set of in - states @xmath118 , and the set of out - states @xmath119 , are _ different _ ( dense ) subspaces of the same hilbert space @xmath74 .",
    "these two dense subspaces are the hardy spaces @xmath85 and @xmath84 , whose wave functions have different but complementary analyticity properties and registered observables @xmath119 is already contained in the historical paper of feynman @xcite .",
    "he distinguishes between the state at times @xmath120 which is defined by the preparation ( our prepared states @xmath121 ) and what he calls the `` state characteristic of the experiment '' at time @xmath122 ( our registered observables @xmath123 ) .",
    "he mentions the possibility that @xmath124 in footnote 14 , attributing it to h. snyder , but does not consider it .",
    "we implement this possibility by the choice of the two hardy spaces @xmath85 and @xmath84 . from the hypothesis ( [ phi+ ] ) ,",
    "( [ phi- ] ) one derives ( by fourier transform , using the paley - wiener theorem for hardy class functions ) the quantum mechanical time asymmetry @xcite . ] .",
    "the axiom , is the only new hypothesis needed for a time asymmetric quantum theory .",
    "the new hypothesis is needed in order to obtain a consistent theory of resonance scattering and decay , that gives the weisskopf - wigner approximation if superpositions over the energy continuum are neglected @xcite . with this new axiom and , quantum mechanics",
    "is no longer a strictly reversible theory , it encapsulates time asymmetry . except for the new axiom and , all the other basic assumptions ( or axioms ) of quantum mechanics , including the dynamical differential equations ( the schrodinger equation for the states or the heisenberg equation for the observables ) remain the same , but",
    "they will be extended to the new vectors ( kets ) of @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "in particular , the born probability for measuring the observable @xmath112 in the state @xmath111 is @xmath127 and this axiom will be extended to elements of @xmath125 .    with the new mathematical concepts of rigged hilbert spaces of hardy type ( [ phi+ ] ) and ( [ phi- ] ) , we can also give a precise meaning to such vectors as in ( [ hdescription ] ) :    we replace the phenomenological breit - wigner in ( [ sdescription ] ) where @xmath128 by an `` exact '' breit - wigner for which the energy extends from @xmath129 .",
    "then one can associate to it an ideal gamow vector @xmath130 , defined as the continuous superposition of the lippmann - schwinger - dirac kets @xmath131 with an `` exact '' breit - wigner as a wave function is an inconsequential convention . ]",
    "@xmath132 the subscript @xmath133 in @xmath134 indicates that the analytic continuation has been done in the second sheet of the analytic s - matrix where the positions @xmath135 of the resonance poles are located .",
    "the gamow vector @xmath130 is thus defined as the continuous linear superposition of the @xmath136 with breit - wigner energy wave functions @xmath137 .",
    "in contrast to the superposition ( [ vector_expansion ] ) for ordinary vectors @xmath112 , the integration in ( [ bwgk ] ) extends over @xmath138 and this is only possible if @xmath139 is a functional @xmath140 over the hardy space , @xmath141 .",
    "this definition of @xmath139 by @xmath142 has been suggested by the continuous deformation of the integral for the s - matrix @xcite .    for the vector ,",
    "@xmath143 defined in ( [ bwgk ] ) ( and only if the integral extends to @xmath134 ) one can derive ( using the property of hardy functions ) @xcite that @xmath144 when @xmath86 is self - adjoint ( and semibounded ) .",
    "this justifies the notation @xmath145 . in dirac",
    "s notation the arbitrary @xmath146 is omitted and ( [ matrix ] ) is written as @xmath147 dirac also omitted the @xmath148 of @xmath149 which is uniquely defined as the extension of the operator @xmath150 to @xmath125 by the first equality in ( [ matrix ] ) , c.f .",
    "appendix @xmath151 .",
    "the gamow ket @xmath152 is thus a generalized vector like a dirac ket but with complex eigenvalue @xmath68 , where @xmath68 is given by the position of the s - matrix pole of the resonance in the lower half plane .",
    "however , whereas the usual dirac ket , is ( most of the time ) thought of as a functional over the schwartz space   or @xmath153 .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger kets must be defined over a function space of analytic functions , cf .",
    "the remarks leading to . ] @xmath78 , the gamow ket ( [ bwgk ] ) is an element of @xmath154 , i.e. , a functional over the hardy space @xmath84 .",
    "the gamow ket and the lippmann - schwinger kets are vectors which are `` more general '' than the usual dirac kets .    the gamow vector with exact breit - wigner energy distribution defined by ( [ bwgk ] ) represents the state associated to the breit - wigner scattering amplitude ( without the background @xmath24 of ( [ sdescription ] ) ) of width @xmath21 . for this state vector one",
    "derives the exponential time evolution : @xmath155 formally ( [ asymmetry ] ) is just ( [ in_the_exponent ] ) applied in the exponent , but for a precise derivation , one needs again the mathematical properties of the hardy functions @xcite and the time asymmetry @xmath156 is a consequence of this . written in the form ( [ r6 ] ) , the time evolution ( [ asymmetry ] ) is also written as @xmath157    since @xmath158 represents in analogy to ( [ bornprob]) the probability amplitude to find the decay product @xmath13 ( described by @xmath159 ) in the state @xmath160 we have derived the exponential law for the probabilities of a transition from the gamow state @xmath139 into any decay product @xmath13 : @xmath161 where @xmath21 is the width of the breit - wigner amplitude in ( [ bwgk ] ) , i.e. , @xmath162 where @xmath68 is the resonance pole position .",
    "this exponential law shows that the lifetime is given by @xmath163 .",
    "another result of ( [ asymmetry2 ] ) , ( [ decayprobx ] ) is the time asymmetry @xmath164 .",
    "it has been called microphysical irreversibility or fundamental quantum mechanical time asymmetry , for further discussions of this subject we refer to the literature @xcite .",
    "the result ( [ asymmetry2 ] ) shows that @xmath139 has only a semigroup time evolution described by the operator @xmath165 in @xmath125 ( defined by ( [ r6 ] ) ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the unitary group evolution described by @xmath166 for every vector in the hilbert space @xmath74 .",
    "an analogous result is also obtained in the relativistic case from the transformation properties of the relativistic gamow vectors under poincar semigroup transformations into the forward light cone .",
    "this is the subject of the subsequent paper  @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we used heuristic arguments about the analyticity property of the out- and in- lippmann - schwinger energy wave functions @xmath168 and @xmath169 to arrive at the two hardy spaces @xmath84 and @xmath85 , their vectors @xmath170 and @xmath105 were defined as those vectors that could be represented by the dirac basis vector expansion in terms of the out- and in- lippmann - schwinger plane wave kets and using hardy functions .",
    "their interpretation was already hinted at by calling @xmath111 prepared states and @xmath112 registered observables .",
    "every experiment in quantum physics can be subdivided into a preparation part and a registration part ,    though this division is not always unique , in particular for complicated experiments @xcite .",
    "we shall apply this principle to the typical ( relativistic ) scattering experiment as depicted in figures  @xmath171 .",
    "most approaches in the foundation of quantum mechanics ascribe fundamental importance to the notions of state and of observable and differentiate between them @xcite . in the standard formalism of scattering theory however , the basic entities are the interaction - free in - states @xmath172 which become @xmath111 in the interaction region , and the interaction - free out - states @xmath173 which are the @xmath174 in the interaction region . the in - state @xmath111 is the state defined by the preparation apparatus ( accelerator ) .",
    "the observable @xmath175 is defined by the registration apparatus ( detector ) ; and according to the new hypothesis states @xmath118 and observables @xmath119 are represented by different dense hardy subspaces of the same hilbert space .",
    "the entities of quantum theory that are confronted with the experimental data ( ratios of large numbers of detector counts ) are the born probabilities of an observable @xmath112 in a state @xmath111 .",
    "the out - states @xmath174 of standard scattering theory do neither represent apparatus controlled states nor observables .",
    "therefore , if one wants to distinguish meticulously between states and observable in scattering experiments , standard scattering theory has to be adapted slightly , in particular the out - state @xmath174 as fundamental notion has to be replaced by an out - observable @xmath112 .    in a scattering experiment , the experimentalist prepares the asymptotic state @xmath172 describing the non - interacting projectile and target beams .",
    "this is depicted in figure  [ scatt_fig_a ] for the ( fictitious ) scattering experiment @xmath176   and the observables are not given by one - dimensional projection operators @xmath177 but by @xmath178 .",
    "the pion @xmath179 and the proton @xmath180 are uncorrelated and are thus described by the direct product of density operators @xmath181 rather than by a vector @xmath182 , but the standard discussion in terms of vectors suffices here . ] .",
    "it is assumed that the time translation generator @xmath53 can be divided into two terms , the `` free - particle '' hamiltonian @xmath183(@xmath184 at rest ) and an interaction part @xmath185 ( or something similar ) : @xmath186 where the split of @xmath53 into @xmath183 and @xmath185 will be different if different in- and out - particles are involved .",
    "the state vectors",
    "@xmath187 evolve in time ( in the schrodinger picture ) according to the free hamiltonian @xmath183 .",
    "when the particles reach their interaction regions , ( cf . figure  [ scatt_fig_a ] ) the free in - state vector @xmath172 changes into an exact state vector @xmath188 whose time evolution is governed by the exact hamiltonian @xmath189 .",
    "this change is usually described by the moeller wave operator @xmath190 : @xmath191 when the post - interaction particles move apart the exact state vector @xmath192 changes into the free out state vector @xmath173 , which is described by the moeller operator @xmath193 in . here",
    "@xmath194 is the proper time in the center - of - mass of the projectile and target .",
    "the vector @xmath173 thus describes a state vector which is determined by the preparation of @xmath172 and by the dynamics of the scattering process .",
    "this is expressed by : @xmath195 where @xmath0 is the operator that describes the dynamical transformation of the asymptotic in state @xmath172 into an asymptotic out state @xmath173 .",
    "the vector @xmath172 and thus @xmath188 are determined by the preparation apparatus ( accelerator ) only and thus @xmath111 and @xmath172 represent apparatus controlled states .",
    "the preparation of @xmath173 is depicted in figure  [ scatt_fig_b ] .",
    "since it is determined by the preparation apparatus of @xmath172 _ and _ the interaction ( dynamics ) described by @xmath185 or @xmath0 , it does not represent a controlled state @xcite .",
    "it is not an observable either .",
    "the experimentalist also builds a detector described by the observable @xmath177 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ scatt_fig_c ] ) . for the sake of definiteness we want to consider the reaction @xmath196 the vector @xmath197 represents the asymptotically free out - observable ( usually also called out - states ) which is @xmath198 in the case .",
    "the observable vectors also evolve in time ( in the heisenberg picture ) according to the free hamiltonian , but since they are observables ( solutions of the heisenberg equation ) they evolve by the adjoint ( or conjugate ) operator @xmath199 : @xmath200    a scattering experiment consists of a preparation apparatus and a registration apparatus ( detector ) , as depicted in figure  [ scatt_fig_d ] .    the detector , or generally the registration apparatus , registers an observable @xmath201 outside the interaction region .",
    "this observable vector @xmath197 comes from a vector @xmath112 which , in analogy to , is given by @xmath202 in the interaction region .",
    "@xmath197 is in the asymptotic region what the observable @xmath112 is in the interaction region , and @xmath172 is in the asymptotic region the state which becomes @xmath111 in the interaction region .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath112 and @xmath111 is governed by the exact hamiltonian @xmath203 the observable @xmath197 is of course not the same as the state @xmath173 , since @xmath173 , like @xmath188 and @xmath172 , is prepared by the accelerator and @xmath197 , and @xmath204 , is defined ( or controlled ) entirely by the detector .",
    "thus the @xmath111 are entirely determined by the accelerator and the @xmath112 are determined by the detector only ( which is not the case for the @xmath205 ) .",
    "hence the set of vectors @xmath206 could be , and in our case is , distinct from the set of vectors @xmath207 .",
    "this is the contents of the hypothesis , .",
    "the vectors @xmath192 fulfill the schrodinger equation with hamiltonian @xmath53 and the vectors @xmath208 fulfill the heisenberg equation of motion .",
    "this explains the well known difference in the sign of the exponent in .",
    "this difference is not of great importance in hilbert space quantum mechanics because with the hilbert space boundary condition the schrodinger as well as the heisenberg equation integrates to the unitary group solution with  .",
    "however , this difference in the sign of the exponent in is very important for the hardy space boundary conditions and , because in the hardy space the dynamical differential equations integrate to be semigroup solutions of with @xmath209 . as a consequence of this one obtains the time asymmetry @xmath210 for the born probabilities and , in the relativistic case discussed below and in @xcite , einstein causality for the quantum mechanical probabilities .",
    "the measured quantities in quantum physics are the born probabilities , i.e. , the probabilities to register an observable @xmath211 in a state @xmath212 @xmath213 the born probability amplitude @xmath214 is expressed using the standard notions of scattering theory , and the new as the matrix element of the @xmath0-operator : @xmath215 this is essentially the statement of standard scattering theory @xcite @xcite except that there one speaks of out - states @xmath174 instead of out - observables @xmath112 .",
    "but born probabilities correlate observables and states , not states and other states , and the detector is not built to the specifications of prepared states , but to the specification of observables .",
    "the matrix element is the probability amplitude for the observable @xmath112 in the state @xmath111 .",
    "it can thus also be given in terms of the asymptotic quantities as the probability amplitude for the observable @xmath197 ( e.g. , @xmath216 in the example ) in the `` state '' @xmath173 .",
    "the vectors @xmath217 are the prepared in - states and the detected out - observable vectors @xmath218 are often also _ called _ the out - states @xcite and the array of complex amplitudes @xmath219 is called the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "the labels @xmath220 and @xmath221 stand for a whole collection of _ discrete _ quantum numbers .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix is also defined when @xmath220 and/or @xmath221 are continuous labels , only then the @xmath0-matrix does not represent probability but a probability density .",
