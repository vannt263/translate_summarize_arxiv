    "perturbative calculations beyond the next - to - leading order of quantum chromodynamics are notorious for their complexity . already the next - to - next - to - leading order presents tremendous obstacles .",
    "one of them is the evaluation of infrared and ultraviolet divergent two - loop virtual amplitudes .",
    "this is an unsolved issue in the general case despite the existence of a few analytic results for low multiplicity processes .",
    "another obstacle is the evaluation of double - real and mixed real - virtual contributions containing infrared singular phase space integrals . in principle , these contributions can be obtained by means of monte carlo techniques , once suitable subtractions have been introduced to generate numerically integrable functions .",
    "the form of the subtractions defines a _ subtraction scheme_. unfortunately , it turns out that subtraction schemes are extremely complex . at present",
    ", there are several on - going multi - year efforts at the construction of general solutions .",
    "antenna subtraction @xcite , and @xmath0 subtraction @xcite , are amongst the most advanced initiatives , which have already found several non - trivial applications .",
    "another scheme under construction has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we will be concerned with the subtraction scheme stripper introduced by one of us in ref .",
    "inspired in some aspects by ideas of frixione , kunszt and signer @xcite , and in other aspects by ideas of binoth and heinrich @xcite , the scheme has proven its worth in many applications : it has allowed for the determination of nnlo corrections to hadronic top - quark pair production @xcite , fully differential top - quark decays @xcite , inclusive semileptonic charmless b - quark decays @xcite , associated higgs boson and jet production in gluon fusion @xcite , muon decay spin asymmetry @xcite , and t - channel single - top production @xcite .",
    "the listed advanced stripper applications performed independently of the inventor have been preceded by the much simpler case of qed corrections to @xmath1-boson decay into a pair of massless leptons @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to complete the construction of the scheme in order to allow for the evaluation of cross sections for arbitrary processes .    the original idea of ref .",
    "@xcite was to concentrate on the numerical calculation of the coefficients of the laurent expansion in @xmath2 ( dimensional regularization parameter , with space - time dimension @xmath3 ) of the double - real cross section contribution .",
    "the latter requires a phase space integral over the momenta not only of the partons present in the born approximation , but also of two additional massless partons .",
    "it seemed obvious that other cross section contributions are much easier to obtain , since their kinematics is , in the worst case , the same as that of next - to - leading order real - radiation contributions .",
    "furthermore , the concept was to refrain from ( almost ) any analytic integration . by inspection of other efforts , it was clear that it is the insistence on analytic integration that makes the subtraction schemes difficult to develop .",
    "finally , in order to avoid as many complications as possible , the construction was performed uniformly in @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "this corresponds to conventional dimensional regularization , where both momenta and spin degrees - of - freedom of external particles are @xmath4 dimensional .",
    "this implies that even born matrix elements will have a non - trivial expansion in @xmath2 . while the other basic ideas of the scheme stood the test of time , the use of cdr is now an important drawback .",
    "indeed , software implementations of tree - level matrix elements only provide them at @xmath5 , i.e.  in four dimensions .",
    "this makes it necessary to recalculate the matrix elements for each project from scratch .",
    "furthermore , the need to parameterize an increasing number of dimensions depending on the multiplicity of the process seems not only a major annoyance , but also a source of inefficiency . in this publication",
    ", we will solve the problem by introducing a number of corrections to the integrated subtraction terms in the double - real radiation contribution . as a result",
    ", we will formulate the scheme in t hooft - veltman regularization .",
    "in particular , we will only need four - dimensional external momenta and polarizations in the evaluation of actual matrix elements .",
    "there will still be a trace of higher dimensionality in the integration over unresolved momenta .",
    "however , we will only have to consider six dimensional unresolved momenta in the worst case . on the example of top - quark pair production",
    ", we will also demonstrate that the introduced improvements of stripper fulfill their purpose .",
    "we stress that we only present the algorithm to obtain the expressions needed for the implementation of the subtraction scheme .",
    "this algorithm requires the knowledge of soft and collinear limits of qcd amplitudes and provides the expressions for the subtraction and integrated subtraction terms by simple substitutions . due to the number and size of the resulting final formulae ,",
    "we do not reproduce them here . instead , we plan to provide a software package in the future .",
    "nevertheless , existing calculations can be converted to t hooft - veltman regularization with moderate effort following this publication .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present an outline of the subtraction scheme together with a complete list of cross section contributions to evaluate in a general next - to - next - to - leading order calculation .",
    "subsequently , we proceed with the construction of the scheme by considering its major elements : phase space decomposition ( section  [ sec : decomposition ] ) , phase space parameterization ( section  [ sec : parameterization ] ) , and derivation of the subtraction and integrated subtraction terms ( section  [ sec : subtraction ] ) .",
    "this part is common to the cdr and hv formulations .",
    "afterwards , we discuss the modifications necessary to introduce hv regularization : average over the azimuthal angles ( section  [ sec : azimuthalaverage ] ) , separation of finite contributions ( section  [ sec : finitecontributions ] ) , and finally the regularization itself ( section  [ sec : hvregularization ] ) .",
    "this part is followed by the example of top - quark pair production in the gluon fusion channel ( section  [ sec : example ] ) .",
    "the main text is closed with conclusions .",
    "appendices form an important part of the publication .",
    "they are self - contained , and the information provided therein is sufficient to construct the complete subtraction scheme in the most general case .",
    "our notation is summarized in [ sec : notation ] .",
    "spherical angles in @xmath4 dimensions are discussed in [ sec : spherical ] .",
    "divergences of virtual amplitudes are considered in [ sec : virtualir ] , whereas limits of amplitudes are contained in [ sec : treelimits ] and [ sec:1llimits ] .",
    "[ sec : altarelliparisi ] contains the well - known altarelli - parisi splitting kernels necessary for initial - state collinear renormalization of partonic cross sections .",
    "we are interested in the calculation of next - to - next - to - leading order qcd corrections to scattering cross sections .",
    "the subtraction scheme we will describe can also be used for decay processes , since the phase space integrals present there share the same structure .",
    "the formulae below would only have to be trivially modified .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to include qed corrections by a modification of the color algebra ( see [ sec : notation ] ) . we will not discuss this issue in any more detail",
    "we now need to specify the possible initial and final states . at present ,",
    "the most relevant case is hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "therefore , we will give expressions with this class of processes in mind .",
    "nevertheless , we will separate the hadron scale physics from the parton scale physics . indeed",
    ", we will only ever manipulate partonic cross sections .",
    "this makes it possible to include lepton - hadron and lepton - lepton scattering processes by simply removing factorization contributions .",
    "as far as the final state is concerned , we only require that there be at least two particles at the born level .",
    "the reason is that in the special case of a single particle , the partonic cross section becomes a distribution , and we assume that we can work with ordinary functions only . in the following , we will concentrate on external partons carrying a color charge .",
    "any additional particles , which are not charged under the color gauge group play no role whatsoever in the construction of the scheme , and can be trivially included in the phase space integrals .",
    "the hadronic cross section is known to factorize into a convolution of parton distribution functions and the renormalized partonic cross section _",

    "if we are able to numerically evaluate the partonic cross section , @xmath13 , for an arbitrary initial - state energy , then we can also obtain the hadronic cross section by an additional integration over the parton momentum fractions .",
    "this is the reason , why the construction of the subtraction scheme will never make reference to the initial - state hadrons , but only to the initial - state partons .",
    "the partonic cross section can be expanded in a series in @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the renormalization scale . up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) it reads _ ab = ^(0)_ab + ^(1)_ab + ^(2)_ab .",
    "each term of the expansion can be further decomposed according to the multiplicity of the final state . at leading order ^(0)_ab = ^_ab",
    "= _ n _ n^(0 ) | _ n^(0 ) _ n , where @xmath16 is the square of the partonic center - of - mass energy , while @xmath17 is the spin and color average factor , defined as the product of the number of spin and color degrees of freedom of the partons @xmath9 and @xmath18 .",
    "the subscript @xmath19 points to the number of final states in this contribution .",

    "@xmath20 is the measurement function defining the observable .",
    "it is a function of the final state momenta and flavors . up to the next - to - next - to - leading order",
    ", we need three such functions , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "they must fulfill the requirements of infrared safety , i.e.  if the energy of a final state parton vanishes , or if the parton becomes collinear to another one , then @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    at next - to - leading order",

    "finally , at next - to - next - to - leading order , we have ^(2)_ab = ^_ab + ^_ab + ^_ab + ^_ab + ^_ab , with    ^_ab = _ n+2 _ n+2^(0 ) | _ n+2^(0 ) _",

    "unfortunately , phase spaces with @xmath27 and @xmath28 final states contain infrared singular configurations , which are regulated with dimensional regularization .",
    "the latter , if applied naively , spoils the stability of the numerics , since a limit has to be taken once all contributions are combined .",
    "this problem is resolved with a subtraction scheme , which extracts the explicit singularities and provides integrable functions , which do not depend on the parameter of dimensional regularization .",
    "the idea behind the construction of the subtraction scheme stripper is to derive laurent expansions in @xmath29 for each of the cross section contributions independently .",
    "the basic algorithm has three stages :    phase space decomposition ( section  [ sec : decomposition ] ) : : :    phase spaces with @xmath27 and @xmath28 final - state    particles are decomposed into sectors , in which only certain types of    singularities may occur ; phase space parameterization ( section  [ sec : parameterization ] ) : : :    in each sector , a special parameterization is introduced using    spherical coordinates in @xmath4 dimensions ( [ sec : spherical ] ) ,    in which singularities are only parameterized with 2 variables for    @xmath27-final - state - particles phase spaces , and with 4    variables for @xmath28-final - state - particles phase spaces ; generation of subtraction and integrated subtraction terms ( section  [ sec : subtraction ] ) : : :    in each parameterization , subtraction terms in the relevant variables    are introduced , which make it possible to obtain an expansion in    @xmath29 , the coefficients of which are integrable .",
    "the    subtraction terms only require the knowledge of the singular limits of    qcd amplitudes ( [ sec : treelimits ] and [ sec:1llimits ] ) , and are process    independent in the sense that the process dependence is confined to    the matrix elements .",
    "furthermore , pointwise convergence of phase space    integration is guaranteed .",
    "after application of this algorithm , cross sections may in principle be evaluated numerically . nevertheless , since dimensional regularization involves infinite dimensional vectors , the effective dimension of the vectors , which actually occur in the calculation increases with multiplicity .",
    "in fact , any new vector requires an increase of the effective dimension by one . for two - to - two processes at leading order ,",
    "one already needs five dimensions at next - to - next - to - leading order .",
    "furthermore , matrix elements must be provided as expansions in @xmath2 . in order to simplify the calculation ,",
    "we introduce the t hooft - veltman version of dimensional regularization , in which resolved particle momenta and spin degrees - of - freedom are four - dimensional . in this case , we also only need four - dimensional matrix elements .",
    "the construction proceeds in additional three stages :    average over azimuthal angles ( section  [ sec : azimuthalaverage ] ) : : :    integrated subtraction terms , which have been derived in relation to a    collinear limit , are averaged over the unphysical transverse    direction . for most cases ,",
    "this is equivalent to the use of averaged    splitting functions , but there are important exceptions .",
    "this step is    important in order not to have contractions of four - dimensional matrix    elements with @xmath4-dimensional transverse vectors ; separation of finite contributions ( section  [ sec : finitecontributions ] ) : : :    the different contributions listed in this section are further    decomposed into classes with different kinematics and loop order .",
    "the    sum of the terms in each class is finite .",
    "this requires a modification    of the integrated subtraction terms for the double - real radiation . in    practice ,",
    "counterterms are introduced , which are added to one class of    contributions and subtracted from another ; t hooft - veltman regularization of separately finite contributions ( section  [ sec : hvregularization ] ) : : :    the measurement function is modified to contain delta - functions    restricting the momenta of resolved particles to be four - dimensional .    for most classes of finite contributions , this is already sufficient    to fulfill the requirements of t hooft - veltman regularization , and    the matrix elements can be evaluated in four dimensions .",
    "nevertheless ,    one class , the single - unresolved contributions to double - real    radiation , requires a further modification of the integrated    subtraction terms .",
    "after these steps , the subtraction scheme does not require higher orders of the @xmath2-expansion of the matrix elements , and all resolved momenta are four - dimensional .",
    "the calculation still involves unresolved momenta , which may need up to two additional dimensions , but only occur in soft and splitting functions .",
    "in general , two - to - two processes at leading order require five - dimensional unresolved momenta at next - to - next - to - leading order . for higher multiplicity",
    ", six - dimensional momenta must be introduced .",
    "the first step in the construction of the subtraction scheme is the decomposition of the phase space into sectors . in each of the sectors",
    ", the momenta of selected partons are parameterized with a few relevant variables ( see section  [ sec : parameterization ] ) , which allows for easy extraction of explicit poles in the dimensional regularization parameter @xmath2 , and generation of numerically integrable coefficients of the laurent series ( see section  [ sec : subtraction ] ) .",
    "the decomposition is performed with the help of _ selector functions_. the only essential property required of the selector functions , besides that they form a decomposition of unity , is that they vanish in case of soft and/or collinear limits not covered by the parameterization of a given sector .",
    "cross sections are defined with a measurement function , which specifies an infrared safe observable .",
    "this measurement function reduces the number of possible singular configurations .",
    "for instance , at next - to - leading order , the measurement function @xmath30 only allows a parton to become soft ( vanishing energy ) , two massless partons to become collinear to each other ( vanishing relative angle ) , or a parton to become both soft and collinear to another massless parton .",
    "this is achieved by the vanishing of @xmath30 for any other singular configuration .",
    "@xmath30 also enters the definition of cross sections at next - to - next - to - leading order , if they involve @xmath27 partons in the final state .",
    "the selector functions for @xmath27-parton phase space integrals are used to regulate the singularities allowed by @xmath30 . since at most a pair of partons",
    "may be involved , the selector functions for this case , @xmath31 , have two indices .",
    "the first index , @xmath32 , specifies the _ unresolved _ parton , which is massless and in the final state , while the second index , @xmath33 , specifies the _ reference _ parton , which is massless as well , but may be either in the initial or in the final state .",
    "@xmath31 does not vanish if the unresolved and reference partons become collinear to each other , or if the unresolved parton becomes soft .",
    "however , it vanishes if any gluon besides @xmath32 becomes soft , or if any two partons besides @xmath32 and @xmath34 become collinear and this kinematical configuration is singular . in consequence , if the reference parton is in the initial state , we only have to consider the following flavor pairs , @xmath35 , of the flavor @xmath36 of parton @xmath32 and flavor @xmath37 of parton @xmath34 ( g , g ) , ( g , q ) , ( g,|q ) , ( q , g ) , ( |q , g ) , ( q , q ) , ( |q,|q ) .",
    "if the reference parton , on the other hand , is in the final state , then the number of possible pairs is reduced , because we may use the symmetry between @xmath32 and @xmath34 .",
    "nevertheless , if the unresolved - reference - parton pair contains a gluon , the latter has to be the unresolved parton .",
    "the list is thus ( g , g ) , ( g , q ) , ( g,|q ) , ( q,|q ) .",
    "while the choice of @xmath31 is by no means unique , we have to provide a valid set .",
    "we choose a form very similar to the one described in @xcite . to this end , we introduce    d_i , k & = ( ) ^(1-_ik)^ ,    where @xmath38 for a gluon and @xmath39 for a quark , while @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is the energy of parton @xmath32 , and @xmath42 is the relative angle between partons @xmath32 and @xmath34 . with the help of @xmath43 ,",
    "we define _",
    "i , k = , d_1 = _ ik .",
    "clearly , @xmath31 form a decomposition of unity _ ik _ i , k = 1 .",
    "we note that the contributions of two sectors , which have the same flavors of the unresolved and reference partons , are equal .",
    "this implies that there is no need to calculate the contributions of such sectors independently . in consequence , even for high - multiplicity processes , the number of independent sectors is moderate .",
    "for example , the most computationally intensive pure gluon amplitudes in multi - jet production will only require three sectors independently of the multiplicity .",
    "the next - to - next - to - leading order measurement function occurring in double - real radiation , @xmath44 , allows for more singular cases than @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , it does not vanish if three partons , or up to two pairs of partons , become collinear .",
    "similarly , it does not vanish if up to two partons become soft .",
    "in other words , it allows for two unresolved partons . in order to accommodate the possible _ triple - collinear _ ( three partons becoming collinear ) and _ double - collinear _ ( two pairs of partons becoming collinear ) limits , we must introduce two types of selector functions : @xmath45 for unresolved partons @xmath32 and @xmath46 with reference parton @xmath34 ; and @xmath47 for unresolved parton @xmath32 with reference parton @xmath34 , and unresolved parton @xmath46 with reference parton @xmath48 . of course",
    ", all indices must be different in both cases , and the ordering of @xmath32 and @xmath46 in @xmath45 , as well as the ordering of the two pairs , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in @xmath47 is irrelevant . in the triple - collinear sector , the flavor sets allowing for singular kinematical configurations are [ eq : flav ] \\{g , g , g } , \\{g , g , q } , \\{g , g,|q } \\{g , q,|q } , \\{q,|q , q } , where @xmath51 can be any quark or anti - quark including @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and we have used crossing to define the flavors of all partons as if they were out - going . if @xmath34 is in the initial state , the possible flavor triples , @xmath54 , we have to consider , are obtained by selecting any of the different flavors in each set of the list and crossing it to the initial state .",
    "this procedure results in the following list ( g , g , g ) , ( g , g , q ) , ( g , g,|q ) , ( g , q , g ) , ( g,|q , g ) , ( g , q , q ) , ( g,|q,|q ) , ( q,|q , g ) , ( q,|q , q ) , ( q,q , q ) , ( q,|q,|q ) .",
    "if @xmath34 is in the final state , on the other hand , we have additional freedom to reorder the partons within the triple .",
    "minding the necessity to regulate final state soft gluons and double - soft quark - anti - quark pairs , we obtain the following list ( g , g , g ) , ( g , g , q ) , ( g , g,|q ) , ( g , q,|q ) , ( q,|q , g ) , ( q,|q , q ) .",
    "the flavor assignments we have to consider in the double - collinear sector are simply a composition of two next - to - leading order cases for the two involved pairs .",
    "let us now introduce    d_ij , k = ( ) ^_i ( ) ^_j ^ ,    where @xmath55 for gluons , @xmath56 for a quark - anti - quark pair , and @xmath57 otherwise .",

    "the number of sectors to actually evaluate is again reduced by the fact that sectors with identical flavors give equal contributions . returning to the example of pure gluon amplitudes",
    ", we would always only have to calculate double - real radiation contributions of seven sectors : three triple - collinear and four double - collinear .    we must finally point out that the sectors we have introduced are sufficient for any problem with at least three massless partons . in the case of only two massless partons ( say heavy - quark pair - production from colorless initial states ) in the final state ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce fictitious reference momenta .",
    "after having decomposed the phase space into sectors using selector functions of section  [ sec : decomposition ] , we now need to introduce appropriate parameterizations for the single - collinear sector ( one unresolved momentum ) , and the triple- and double - collinear sectors ( two unresolved momenta ) .",

    "there will appear , however , delta - functions of the form    ^(-2)(r+u ) = ( r^0 + u^0)^2 ^(-2 ) ( ) & + ^(-2)(r+u_1+u_2 ) = ( r^0+u_1 ^ 0+u_2 ^ 0)^2 ^(-2 ) ( ) & + ^(-2)(r_1+u_1 ) ^(-2)(r_2+u_2 ) = ^2 ^(-2)(_1 ) ^(-2)(_2 ) &    these delta - functions will restrict the angular integrations for the reference momenta to be four - dimensional .",
    "the energy factors are , nevertheless , non - trivial .",
    "in the case of collinear poles , the integration over the reference momentum energy is not simply four - dimensional , since the actual resolved momentum is a sum of the reference and unresolved momenta .",
    "it remains to argue that the restriction does not affect the finite part of the result .",
    "this is a true assertion , since the result is finite independently of the measurement function .",
    "the missing @xmath2-dimensional integrations are finite , but evaluated over a volume of the phase space , which vanishes at @xmath345 .",
    "thus the missing contribution vanishes as well and can be neglected from the start .",
    "we have thus shown that the hv regularization for this group of contributions amounts to evaluating matrix elements and resolved - parton phase spaces in four dimensions .",
    "the integration over the unresolved partons is nevertheless performed in @xmath4 dimensions . in particular ,",
    "if there is one unresolved parton and the contribution is due to a soft limit , the parton kinematics will be integrated non - trivially over the fifth dimension .",
    "similarly , if there are two unresolved partons and the contribution is due to a double - soft limit , one parton will be effectively integrated in five dimensions , while the other in six .",
    "this is , however , the upper bound on the number of required dimensions independently of the multiplicity .",
    "the last contribution to consider is the single - unresolved cross section _ = ^ _ + ^ _ + ^ _ .",
    "it differs from the previous case in one aspect .",
    "it involves both @xmath27- and @xmath19-parton matrix elements .",
    "let us first assume that the calculation is performed with a next - to - leading order measurement function , i.e. @xmath268 . in this case , we can just repeat the previous discussion with @xmath346 , and simply evaluate @xmath27-parton matrix elements and @xmath27-parton phase spaces in four - dimensions .",
    "however , once we turn to the next - to - next - to - leading order measurement function , i.e.  @xmath347 , the subtraction terms will not match the singularities of the amplitudes anymore .",
    "the reason is that the limits originally used in the construction of the subtraction terms in section  [ sec : subtraction ] apply to @xmath4-dimensional amplitudes . for @xmath275 and @xmath256 ,",
    "this problem is easily resolved . in the subtraction terms , we take the splitting functions at @xmath5 .",
    "the soft functions do not depend on @xmath2 and do not require modifications .",
    "the calculation of @xmath275 and @xmath256 can now be performed with a four - dimensional phase space and four - dimensional matrix elements .",
    "the double - real single - unresolved contribution , @xmath243 , requires more care .",
    "the pole contributions must be evaluated with complete splitting functions , i.e.  at @xmath348 . however , when subtraction terms to these pole terms are derived , we take into account that the limits are iterated .",
    "this means , for example , that instead of the triple - collinear splitting function , eq .",
    ", we can use a product of two splitting functions .",
    "the first one will generate the pole , and it must be taken azimuthally averaged and at @xmath348 .",
    "the second one corresponding to the subtraction term must be taken spin - correlated and at @xmath5 .",
    "an example of this procedure is the pole at @xmath118 due to a quark and a gluon in the triple - collinear parameterization sector @xmath131 , to which we would generate a collinear subtraction term with a gluon as reference parton .",
    "the corresponding limit would be a special case of eq .",
    "^(0)_qg(z_12;0 ) ^(0)_q,  (p,  )| ^(0)_gq(z_r12,u_1;= 0 ) |^(0)_q,  (p ,  ) .",
    "since next - to - leading order soft functions do not depend on @xmath2 , there is nothing special to do in their case .",
    "this concerns the cases of a soft pole and collinear subtraction , and of a collinear pole and soft subtraction .",
    "we note , however , that the iterated soft - pole - soft - subtraction limit is easier to obtain form the double - soft limit .",
    "the double - soft function does depend on @xmath2 .",
    "however , this dependence does not contribute to the iterated limit .",
    "after each contribution listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : su ] has been treated this way , we may evaluate all tree - level matrix elements , both with @xmath27- and @xmath19-partons in the final state , in four dimensions .",
    "the derivation of the subtraction and integrated subtraction terms is performed using the algorithm of section  [ sec : subtraction ] , but taking into account that the phase space restriction now acts on the unresolved partons @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "since we use with @xmath349 , the following delta - functions will appear in the triple - collinear parameterization    ^(-2)(r+u_1 ) ^(-2)(u_2 ) & + ^(-2)(r+u_2 ) ^(-2)(u_1 ) & + ^(-2)(r ) ^(-2)(u_1+u_2 ) & + ^(-2)(r ) ^(-2)(u_1 ) &    in the double - collinear parameterization , on the other hand , there will be    ^(-2)(r_1+u_1 ) ^(-2)(r_2 ) ^(-2)(u_2 ) & + ^(-2)(r_2+u_2 ) ^(-2)(r_1 ) ^(-2)(u_1 ) & + ^(-2)(r_1 )",
    "^(-2)(r_2 ) ^(-2)(u_1 ) &    delta - functions involving a reference momentum are only present , if it is in the final state .",
    "notice that in all collinear pole cases , there are no @xmath4-dimensional integrations left .",
    "however , there is a @xmath4-dimensional integration over the unrestricted direction of @xmath89 in the soft - pole case . in practice",
    ", most integrations can be performed analytically , because nothing depends on the respective angles .",
    "there will , however , remain a single integration beyond the dimensions of the resolved momenta .",
    "thus , in the general case , there will be a five - dimensional integration .",
    "the delta - functions , which do not involve the reference momentum , influence the scaling in the singular variables .",
    "this , in turn , has consequences for the counterterms derived in section  [ sec : finitecontributions ] .",
    "there , we gave the necessary scaling exponents for both cdr and hv cases , the latter following from the application of the above listed delta - functions .",
    "whenever the exponents concerned energy variables ( as for collinear poles of subsections  [ sec : caseis4 ] , [ sec : caseis5 ] , [ sec : caseiii ] and [ sec : caseiv ] ) , @xmath350 , the difference between the exponent in cdr and that in hv was 2 , simply because the delta - functions provide an additional factor of @xmath351 . on the other hand , the scaling of the angular variables in the soft - pole cases of subsections  [ sec : caseis5soft ] and [ sec : caseii ]",
    "was affected by the change of the angular measure .",
    "indeed , the delta - function @xmath352 introduces a factor of ^ , which changes the exponent of the relevant angular variables by 1 ( @xmath118 in sector @xmath133 , and both @xmath113 and @xmath118 is sector @xmath127 ) .    notice that the difference in scaling only influences the finite parts of cross sections . in consequence , if one would proceed along the algorithm of this section , but without separating the single- and double - unresolved contributions , and without applying the counterterms of section  [ sec : finitecontributions ] , the result would be finite , but incorrect .",
    "this remark completes the discussion of the t hooft - veltman regularization of the single - unresolved contributions , and by the same of the complete cross section .",
    "finally , we remind that the factorization contributions @xmath256 and @xmath258 must be calculated in a boosted frame as discussed in subsection  [ sec : caseiv ] .",
    "one could wonder , if this means that the complete calculation is frame dependent .",
    "this is not the case , since after all the modifications , the result for the @xmath353 cross section is exactly the same as in cdr . in cdr , however , each cross section contribution listed in section  [ sec : outline ] is separately lorentz invariant .",
    "in this section , we present a comparison between results obtained using conventional dimensional regularization and t hooft - veltman regularization for an example cross section at next - to - next - to - leading order .",
    "the aim is to demonstrate that the modifications described in sections  [ sec : finitecontributions ] and [ sec : hvregularization ] lead to correct results in a realistic calculation .",
    "we select inclusive top - quark pair production in the gluon fusion channel with up to two gluons in the final state .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that collinear limits involving gluons have the most involved structure of spin correlations .",
    "we are thus able to verify the azimuthal average corrections we have provided in section  [ sec : azimuthalaverage ] .",
    "we neglect all contributions involving finite remainders of one- and two - loop amplitudes .",
    "as explained before , their independence of the regularization scheme can be proven explicitly by noticing that they enter the calculation in exactly the same manner as born amplitudes in a next - to - leading order calculation .",
    "finally , we do not include the contribution of the subtracted six - point born amplitude , which is trivially independent of the regularization , as it is finite by definition .",
    "the relevant partonic cross section is rendered dimensionless and independent of the value of the strong coupling with the normalization ^(2 ) = ^(2 ) , where @xmath356 is the total cross section contribution at @xmath357 .",
    "furthermore , we set _",
    "r = _ f = m_t .",
    "our results are obtained at the point = = 0.5 .",
    "tables [ tab : doubleunresolvedcdr ] and [ tab : doubleunresolvedhv ] contain results for partial double - unresolved contributions calculated in cdr and hv regularizations respectively . in each case",
    ", the last row gives the total double - unresolved contribution .",
    "whenever errors are quoted , they are due to monte carlo integration .",
    "contributions involving two - parton kinematics have been computed with a deterministic integration method , which implies that their error is negligible , and , therefore , not specified in the tables . by construction ,",
    "double - unresolved contributions should be finite in both regularizations .",
    "indeed , coefficients of the poles in @xmath2 are consistent with @xmath358 within one standard deviation for all but the leading singularity in cdr , where consistency at a level below two standard deviations is observed .",
    "the calculation has been performed with optimization based on the behavior of the finite part , which is one reason for the slightly lower quality of the leading pole contribution .",
    "notice , nevertheless , that there is no difference between cdr and hv at the leading pole of each contribution as far as the actual integrand is concerned .",
    "therefore , divergence cancellation in the hv case within one sigma is sufficient to claim divergence cancellation in both regularizations . on the other hand , analytic cancellation of the coefficient of the @xmath359 pole",
    "has already been shown in @xcite .",
    "due to severe cancellations between the different partial contributions , it was necessary to use large monte carlo samples .",

    "the convergence in the hv regularization was noticeably better .",

    "<S> four years ago , one of us introduced a novel subtraction scheme @xcite for the evaluation of double - real radiation contributions to cross sections at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> this approach , named sector improved phase space for real radiation ( stripper ) , has already found several non - trivial applications . in particular , it has allowed for the determination of nnlo corrections to hadronic top - quark pair production , fully differential top - quark decays , inclusive semileptonic charmless b - quark decays , associated higgs boson and jet production in gluon fusion , muon decay spin asymmetry , and t - channel single - top production . </S>",
    "<S> common to these calculations was the use of conventional dimensional regularization ( cdr ) . in this publication , </S>",
    "<S> we present a complete formulation of the subtraction scheme for arbitrary processes with any number of colored partons in the final state , and up to two partons in the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we modify the integrated subtraction terms of the double - real radiation to enable the introduction of the t hooft - veltman version of dimensional regularization ( hv ) , in which resolved states are four - dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the correctness of our approach on the example of top - quark pair production in the gluon fusion channel . </S>"
