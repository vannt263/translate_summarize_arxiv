    "everything in nature is quantum mechanical at its core but , as the history of physics teaches us , many processes can be studied through `` classical '' equations . more specifically with equations that do not involve explicitly ( or implicitly as occurs when using natural units ) planck s constant .",
    "examples are newton s equation , thermodynamic equations , classical field equations and amongst these , of particular interest to us , maxwell s equations@xcite .",
    "maxwell s equations encompass optical phenomena which have a surprising aspect . under certain conditions@xcite , which we recall in the next section",
    ", the equations of say the electric field is analogous to the non relativistic schrodinger equation@xcite .",
    "the potentials in quantum mechanics ( qm ) are identifiable with dielectric materials with different refractive indices with which the laser interacts .",
    "one of the advantages of this fact is that qm effects , probabilistic in nature and valid for massive particle wave packets , can be reproduced , and the theory tested far easier , with optical analog experiments@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we wish to simulate one of the simplest of all qm potentials , i.e. a square potential .",
    "we present both analytic and numerical calculations of a gaussian laser incident upon a single block dielectric .",
    "we shall in particular concentrate upon the transmitted beam or beams .",
    "it will be shown that in the so - called wave limit , where coherence between individual amplitude terms dominates , a single outgoing laser beam emerges . in the other limit , when incoherence dominates , multiple laser beams are transmitted .",
    "we shall calculate both the intensity and position of the first few of these beams .",
    "our intention is to apply these methods to more complex systems , such as twin barrier diffusion and tunnelling@xcite .",
    "the basic ingredients of our approach will be detailed in this paper .",
    "this work differs from some previous papers of the present authors@xcite by calculating in three dimensions and by the explicit use of a laser as the light source .",
    "this provides for a more realistic theoretical study , closer to laboratory experiments .",
    "for some of the analytical calculations we shall make use of the stationary phase method , spm@xcite .",
    "we shall demonstrate in detail how our results depend critically upon the laser angle of incidence with the dielectric block .    in the next section",
    "we derive the gaussian laser amplitude in three - dimensional free space . in section iii",
    "we describe the geometry of the laser with respect to a dielectric block corresponding to a qm well .",
    "also in this section we derive the modification to the laser beam within the dielectric . in section iv we derive the transmission and reflection amplitudes for the laser beam ( or beams ) exiting the dielectric .",
    "the method of calculation follows the so called two step approach@xcite .",
    "this yields an infinite number of contributing amplitudes .",
    "we study the conditions for which complete coherence occurs yielding a single outgoing beam . in the other extreme infinite outgoing beams",
    "are predicted .",
    "we calculate the exit points and intensities of the leading contributions as a function of the incoming angle . in section",
    "v we calculate the first few incoherent beam intensities and their exit points from the dielectric block .",
    "this is performed both analytically and numerically . for this analysis",
    "typical helium - neon laser parameters are employed@xcite .",
    "throughout this paper we consider a fixed frequency @xmath0 .",
    "a fixed frequency implies a stationary system , so we can forego writing the time dependence @xmath1 . for the theoretical analysis we start with plane waves .",
    "these correspond to momentum eigenvalues and determine a fixed direction @xmath2 .",
    "a general solution can then be obtained by convoluting plane waves with a suitable integral .",
    "consider a plane wave moving in the @xmath2-direction , the electric field vector can be then expressed by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a unitary polarization vector , assumed linear , which lies in the plane perpendicular to @xmath2 .",
    "the condition @xmath5 imposed by one of the maxwell equations implies @xmath6 .",
    "this means that @xmath4 is @xmath2 dependent .",
    "now a possible but not unique choice for @xmath4 is @xmath7 we claim this is not unique since , as we vary the direction , we may also rotate the above @xmath4 about the plane wave direction with impunity . furthermore ,",
    "as given , these do not determine a unique @xmath4 in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "in fact the direction of @xmath4 depends upon how these limits are performed . if first we take @xmath9 and then @xmath10 we find @xmath11 .",
    "if we first take @xmath10 and then @xmath9 we find @xmath12 . a general direction in the @xmath13-plane",
    "is obtained by fixing the ratio of @xmath14 and taking simultaneously @xmath8 .",
    "all of the above tells us that the components of @xmath15 are not the same and thus , after integrations with a chosen convolution function , they will yield _ different _ component functions of @xmath15 .",
    "however , if use is made , as we shall do , of a peaked gaussian function that limits all significant values of wave number to @xmath16 we can approximate @xmath4 by a fixed vector in the @xmath13-plane .",
    "the calculation of @xmath15 then greatly simplifies to the calculation of the amplitude @xmath17 .    in free space",
    "the gaussian laser is obtained by convoluting a plane wave with a peaked gaussian , @xmath18\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where the arguments are the components of the wave number in the direction orthogonal to the laser direction , here chosen as the @xmath19 direction , and with a dirac delta function , @xmath20 the electric field amplitude , @xmath21 , is then proportional to @xmath22\\,\\,.\\ ] ] the integral over @xmath23 is straightforward because of the dirac delta function .",
    "so we have @xmath24\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 .",
    "the use of a sharp gaussian also allows us to approximate the electric field amplitude above as follows @xmath26\\,\\,.\\ ] ] from this , after performing two generalized gaussian integrations , we obtain the well known closed formula which describes the free propagation of a gaussian laser beam@xcite , i.e. @xmath27\\,\\ , \\frac{\\mbox{w}_{\\0}^{\\2}}{\\mbox{w}_{\\0}^{\\2}+2\\,i\\,z/\\,k}\\ , \\exp\\left[\\,-\\ , \\frac{x^{^{2}}+y^{^{2}}}{\\mbox{w}_{\\0}^{\\2}+2\\,i\\,z/\\,k } \\right]\\,\\,.\\ ] ] the intensity distribution of the gaussian beam , @xmath28 , is then given by @xmath29\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the radius of the @xmath31 contour after the wave has propagated a distance @xmath19 and @xmath32 the total power in the beam , @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "in fig1 we plot a side view of the laser intensity for different beam waists , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and for a wavelength value of @xmath37 .",
    "these figures display the fact that the spread in momentum is complementary to the spatial laser width . indeed with the angular opening @xmath38 defined as @xmath39 the @xmath31 intensity contours asymptotically approach a cone of angular radius @xmath38 . for our choice of lambda and for a beam waist of the order of mm ( @xmath40 ) the angular radius",
    "is then given by @xmath41 this angle is indicative of the spread in wavelength and as given by @xmath42 decreases with increasing w@xmath43 . on the contrary , as seen by the explicit form of the intensity @xmath44 , the width of a laser , for any chosen value of @xmath19 , grows with w@xmath43 . as an aside we recall that the wave number and position variance are not `` complementary '' ( in the qm sense ) since there is , of course , no uncertainty principle involved for classical variables .",
    "finally we observe that after convolution the laser rays do not travel in a unique direction .",
    "however we shall refer to the laser direction as the direction of the ray of peak intensity .",
    "this is the @xmath19-axis in eq.@xmath45 .",
    "we sketch below the geometry of a laser source at @xmath46 , with the @xmath19-axis extended to a dielectric block with normal the @xmath47-axis .",
    "the angle between the @xmath19 and @xmath47 axis is @xmath48 .",
    "a laser impinging along the @xmath19-axis travels , initially , within the dielectric with refractive index greater than air in a different direction , @xmath49 , with angle @xmath50 w.r.t the @xmath47-axis and angle @xmath51 w.r.t . the @xmath19-axis .",
    "the outgoing situation when the laser exits the dielectric is , as we shall see , conditioned by the impact angle and the laser spatial dimensions .",
    "the axis indicated by @xmath52 and @xmath47 , and for completeness @xmath53 , are obtained from @xmath54 and @xmath19 , and @xmath55 , by a rotation of @xmath48 around the @xmath55-axis .",
    "we chose the @xmath19-axis as that of the center of the laser beam so that we may use directly the expressions for the laser of the previous section .",
    "since the dielectric block is perpendicular to the @xmath47-axis , it is stratified in the @xmath47 direction .",

    "as @xmath48 increases , evidence of a secondary beam is seen . for even high @xmath48 , this beam and others separate and we observe the effect of the incoherent limit of the transmission coefficient .",
    "our curves are calculated directly from the full @xmath127 , however they of course agree with those calculated from each appropriate transmission term .",

    "we plot the @xmath13-profile of each intensity for the four chosen @xmath48 . for these plots",
    "we have arbitrarily chosen @xmath133 , however , with the very small spreading in our simulation , the exact value of @xmath19 ( below several meters ) is irrelevant .",

    "another way of determining these @xmath54 values without going through a numerical calculation is by means of the spm .",
    "we must now work with the individual transmission terms since the spm only yields a single peak position @xmath54 .",
    "the spm applied to an expression which involves a sum of peaks yields only the mean value , normally not even coincident with any of the peaks .",
    "the spm involves taking the derivative of the argument of the phase of a peaked function assuming it more relevant to the peak s position compared to the modulus of the amplitude .",
    "now the phase of our amplitudes take the form @xmath134}\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath135 is a function of @xmath76 ( independent of any @xmath54 dependence ) .",

    "the resulting values of the peaks for @xmath150 are @xmath151 .",
    "these agree very well with the center positions plotted in fig.3 .",
    "the integrated power @xmath32 of each outgoing laser beam _ relative _ to the incoming beam power is given by @xmath152\\,\\right|^{^{2}}\\,\\,.\\ ] ] for the calculation of the separate laser terms it is sufficient to use the following approxiamtions @xmath153^{^{2}}\\,\\,.\\ ] ] these are valid for small @xmath154 .",
    "for example , for the particular case of an incident angle @xmath150 and for a refractive index @xmath155 ( for which we have a diffusion angle @xmath156 ) , @xmath157 hence the first three laser transmission beams have the following relative powers @xmath158 this result is in excellent agreement with the numerical results obtained from eq.([prel ] ) and shown in fig.3 .",
    "our principal objective in this paper is to develop the formalism , conventions and approximations for the interaction of a gaussian laser beam with dielectric structures .",
    "we emphasize in particular the dominant role played by the momentum perpendicular to the dielectric block , @xmath47 component , and in general to any stratified dielectric system .",
    "this result draws a strong analogy with one - dimensional non - relativistic qm .",
    "indeed we have noted in the text that our system corresponds to a qm well potential .",
    "the numerical and other calculations displayed in this work invite experimental confirmation .",
    "it is particularly interesting to note the conditions for coherence and incoherence in this study and compare them with those of one - dimensional qm . in qm",
    "we deal with time dependent wave packets and coherence requires the size of these wave packets to be large w.r.t . the well size . in this work",
    "the analogy is the separation in the @xmath54-variable of laser beams . for this optical study ,",
    "coherence can be achieved not only by increasing the laser beam size w.r.t .",
    "the block depth @xmath145 so that overlap occurs between outgoing beams , but also by reducing the incident angle @xmath48 .",
    "this also leads to overlap of individual terms since the separation of the @xmath54 exit points is reduced , for any fixed laser size , by decreasing @xmath48 .",
    "we have calculated the various @xmath54 values for incoherence , both by the spm and numerically and found complete agreement .",
    "they remain , of course , to be confirmed experimentally .",
    "we have also calculated , for various incident angles @xmath48 , the outgoing incoherent beam intensities and profiles .",
