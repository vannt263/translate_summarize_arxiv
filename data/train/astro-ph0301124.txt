    "the study of circumstellar disks around young stars may provide insight into how and when planets form .",
    "theoretical models suggest different mechanisms and timescales for planet formation .",
    "the core accretion model requires that a rocky core of @xmath6 10m@xmath7 aggregate before substantial gaseous accretion can form a jupiter - like gas giant .",
    "this theory predicts that gas giants will form a few au or more from the star due to the enormously greater mass of solids available beyond the snow line .",
    "a time period of roughly 10@xmath8 yr is predicted for giant planet formation to occur through runaway accretion in a greater than minimum mass solar nebula @xcite . a second",
    "though less thoroughly investigated model , which may require a time period as brief as 10@xmath9  yr for the formation of gas giant planets , proposes that such planets may form as a consequence of gravitational instabilities in disks @xcite .",
    "typically , astronomers have resorted to emission from trace molecules and dust for insight into the physical conditions and masses of gas in circumstellar disks . once these tracers disappear , the disks appear to have been removed from the system .",
    "two decades of such observations have shown that young stellar objects ( ysos ) appear to be surrounded by thick envelopes composed of dust and gas that evolve into circumstellar disks on the order of 10@xmath10  yr @xcite .",
    "the absence of thermal dust emission , as measured through millimeter and infrared continuum excesses , as well as the non - detection of co line emission towards most t  tauri stars ( tts ) over the ages of 3 - 5  myr old , suggests that the disks become depleted in gas and dust grains rather quickly .",
    "two viable explanations may account for these observations : in one model , when the disk becomes undetectable it no longer exists , while in the second the disk is present but difficult to detect . according to the first of the these scenarios , circumstellar material has been dissipated through one or more of several processes : photo - evaporation , accretion onto the star , tidal stripping by nearby stars , outflows , or strong stellar winds @xcite .",
    "the second scenario , which describes the evolution of a circumstellar disk into a planetary system according to the core accretion theory of planet formation , suggests that larger structures ( i.e. , planetesimals ) could have formed through accretion , collecting both solids and some gases like co , reducing the emitting surface area of the dust and pushing the emission from both dust grains and gaseous co below detectable levels .    in order to know",
    "whether the disks are dispersed or accretionally evolved , we must find a method to observe the part of the disk that does not disappear quickly during accretion .",
    "since the bulk of the gaseous component of the disk , hydrogen and helium gas , will be the last to be collected into protoplanets , assuming that it avoids being removed through the various processes listed above , the h and he should remain in the disk and in the gas phase even after the dust and gaseous co has become undetectable .",
    "therefore , we need to study the h@xmath0 gas directly .",
    "h@xmath0 , at the low temperatures typically found in circumstellar environments , predominantly populates the ground vibrational level and only low rotational excitation levels and remains difficult to stimulate due to its lack of a dipole moment . in the small , inner regions of disks where temperatures may be high enough to excite h@xmath0 gas into the first vibrational state such that 2.12183 @xmath2 m emission might be possible ,",
    "densities often are too high to permit detectable levels of h@xmath0 line emission .",
    "therefore , the bulk of the disk material has remained nearly impossible to detect directly .",
    "assuming that most of the gas in these environments maintains a temperature much less than 1000 k , few molecules will be excited into the first vibrational state ; thus , the flux of thermally excited line emission from h@xmath0 at 2.12183 @xmath2 m will be extremely low and consequently impossible to detect . in the case of t tau ,",
    "the detected emission from shocked h@xmath0 traces approximately 10@xmath11  m@xmath12 @xcite , a mere fraction of the total mass in the system @xcite .",
    "pure rotational h@xmath0 line emission found in the mid - infrared at 17 and 28 @xmath2 m corresponds to excitation temperatures on the order of @xmath6100 k. these lines therefore should act as tracers of the bulk of the unshocked gas which resides in the circumstellar disks .",
    "of these two lines , only the 17 @xmath2 m line can be successfully observed from ground based telescopes ; however , thi et al .",
    "( 1999,2001a , b ) reported the detection of emission from h@xmath0 at 17 and 28 @xmath2 m using a low spatial and spectral resolution mid - infrared spectrometer on the infrared space observatory ( _ iso _ ) towards gg  tau , more evolved sources with vega - type debris disks , and herbig ae / be stars .",
    "however , in much more sensitive , higher spatial and spectral resolution mid - infrared spectra obtained by richter et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , centered on the 17 @xmath2 m h@xmath0 emission line , no emission was observed towards gg  tau , hd 163296 , and ab aur .",
    "the richter et al .",
    "results not only did not confirm the detections made toward these stars , but also call into question other _ iso _ detections .    we have taken a different approach . motivated by models predicting that x - rays produced by tts may be sufficient to ionize a small fraction of the gas and indirectly stimulate observable near - infrared h@xmath0 emission in circumstellar environments through collisions between h@xmath0 molecules and nonthermal electrons @xcite , we have begun a study of tts searching for near - infrared h@xmath0 emission .",
    "we reported our initial detections of quiescent h@xmath0 emission in the near - infrared towards tw hya @xcite , an x - ray bright classical tts ( ctts ) , and doar  21 @xcite , an x - ray bright weak - lined tts ( wtts ) .",
    "we previously have suggested that the most plausible explanation for the stimulation of the h@xmath0 emission from these sources is the x - ray ionization process .",
    "however , preliminary results from our modeling of uv and x - ray photons originating from the source and incident on the disk at varying angles ( bary , in prep ) suggest that uv radiation from the source may be an equally likely stimulus for the observed emission .",
    "therefore , these results indicate that gaseous disks of h@xmath0 surrounding other tts possessing substantial x - ray and uv fluxes could be detected at 2.12183 @xmath2 m using high - resolution , near - infrared spectroscopy .    in this paper ,",
    "we present the first results of a high - resolution , near - infrared spectroscopic survey of ctts and wtts in the taurus - auriga and @xmath13  ophiuchus star forming regions .",
    "we report new detections of h@xmath0 towards two sources : gg  tau  a and lkca  15 .",
    "we use the new data and our previously reported detections of h@xmath0 emission toward tw hya and doar 21 to estimate disk masses for these four stars .",

    "integration times for our program stars , with k magnitudes 5.9 @xmath15 k @xmath15 9.6 ( table 1 ) , ranged from 3600 s to 7200 s. nightly observations were obtained of an a0v star , either vega or hd 2315 , for telluric calibration , with on - source integration times of 600 sec .",
    "flat - field images were made using a tungsten filament lamp internal to phoenix .",
    "observations were made by nodding the telescope 14  along the slit , producing image pairs that were then subtracted to remove the sky background and dark current .",
    "the spectra were extracted from columns of the array covering the region from 07 east to 07 west of each source for total beam widths of 14 , beyond which no emission was detected .",
    "spectra were then divided by the continuum to produce normalized spectra and ratioed with that of a star with a featureless spectrum in this spectral region in order to remove telluric absorption features from the spectra of the program stars .",
    "su aur , a program star classified as an x - ray bright g2iii wtts produced a high signal to noise ratio , featureless spectrum and therefore , also was utilized as a telluric calibrator .",
    "we detected line emission very nearly at 2.12183 @xmath2 m from two ctts , gg  tau  a and lkca  15 and , as reported previously @xcite , the wtts doar  21 and the ctts tw  hya @xcite ew of 13  ) in the herbig bell catalog ; however , wolk & walter ( 1996 ) measured w@xmath16  ( h@xmath17 )  =  21.9  , leading some authors to reclassify this star as a ctts . ] .",
    "full spectra for all our target stars obtained with phoenix are presented in figure  1 .",
    "most of the absorption features in these spectra are telluric .",
    "as best as could be done given tens - of - minutes timescale fluctuations in atmospheric conditions , the spectra presented in figure  2 have been corrected for telluric absorption features , extracted from the total spectra presented in fig .  1 and shifted in velocity using previously measured values of v@xmath18 @xcite , placing the spectra in the rest frames of the stars . in no cases in which h@xmath0 emission was observed was any emission detected in the spectra beyond 07 from the central positions of the star .",
    "the central wavelengths of the emission lines were determined by fitting a gaussian to the emission features . in each case , the central wavelength of the observed emission line matches the rest wavelength of the 2.12183  @xmath2 m  v=1@xmath10  s(1 ) transition of h@xmath0 to within errors and the line is narrow ( @xmath19 14 km s@xmath4 ) yet spectrally resolved ( @xmath20  9  km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the observed emission is from gaseous h@xmath0 molecules within @xmath6  100 au of the stars .",
    "the central velocities of the observed h@xmath0 reservoirs are neither red - shifted nor blue - shifted with respect to the stars and therefore experience no net line - of - sight motion .",
    "equivalent widths and line strengths for all four stars now detected in the h@xmath0 line , corrected for extinction , are presented in table  1 , along with 3-@xmath21 upper limits for the line strengths of the non - detections .",
    "a@xmath22 was determined using previously reported values for the visual extinction ( table  5 ) and taking a@xmath22/a@xmath23 = 0.1 @xcite .",
    "several of our sources , notably v836 tau , v819 tau , and ip tau show possible emission peaks at wavelengths just shortward of 2.122 @xmath2 m .",
    "the low signal to noise levels of these stars spectra , however , preclude drawing any positive conclusions about these features in these data .",
    "two absorption features centered at 2.11699  @xmath2 m and 2.12137  @xmath2 m remain after the telluric corrections were made .",
    "the line at 2.12137  @xmath2 m labeled ` al ' is indicated in figure 2 .",
    "the line at 2.11699 can be seen in many of the fig .",
    "1 spectra , in most cases slightly red - shifted to @xmath24  2.117  @xmath2 m .",
    "we have identified these lines as photospheric absorption features produced by al @xcite .",
    "each of the stars with observed h@xmath0 emission have both of these photospheric features , as do many of the sources not detected in h@xmath0 emission ; however , four of our sources do not .",
    "the strength of these absorption features decreases toward earlier spectral types and disappears entirely for the f and g type stars in our sample ( table 1 ) in agreement with the wallace & hinkle ( 1996 ) data .",
    "the spectrum of lkca 15 is presented in figure 2 .",
    "the double - peaked h@xmath0 emission line profile for lkca  15 is consistent with the double - peaked co(j=2@xmath11 ) and hco@xmath25 emission profiles reported by duvert et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . the presence of blue - shifted and red - shifted emission peaks for each of these emission features , including the h@xmath0 , is indicative of gas revolving in a circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "the peak - to - peak velocity separation for the h@xmath0 is resolved at @xmath26v  @xmath27  10  @xmath28  1.5  km  s@xmath4 , which is considerably larger than the peak - to - peak separation of @xmath26v  @xmath27  2  km  s@xmath4 found from both the co and hco@xmath25 spectra . for a k5v star with a disk inclination angle of 34@xmath28 10  as determined by duvert et al . , the h@xmath0 emission would be produced at radial distances of between 10 and 30  au while the co emission should arise from molecular gas located @xmath6@xmath29600  au from the source .",
    "the combination of the co and h@xmath0 data indicate that the near - infrared h@xmath0 emission is sampling a different reservoir of gas than is the co(j=2@xmath11 ) emission and that the h@xmath0 is from regions of the circumstellar disk in which gas and ice giant planets might form .",
    "in addition , the mechanism responsible for exciting the h@xmath0 apparently is most efficient in doing so for gas at these intermediate distances from lkca  15 .",
    "as all four stars sharing h@xmath0 emission have similar h@xmath0 line widths , fluxes and relative velocities , it is plausible that the excitation mechanism is similar in all four stellar environments .",
    "we suggest , therefore , that the h@xmath0 emission emerges from the 10 - 30 au region around each of these four stars .",
    "only lkca  15 , however , has a disk inclined to our line of sight such that we can distinguish the double - peaked profile ( tw  hya , in fact , is known to be viewed nearly pole - on ) .",
    "the spatial resolution for the spectra centered on each source probes emission from the disks out to radii of @xmath6  30  au for tw  hya and @xmath6  110  au for lkca  15 , gg  tau , and doar  21 .",
    "thus , the spatial resolution in our data is consistent with our spectroscopically derived conclusion about the location of the emitting h@xmath0 .    in concluding that the gas is located in the regions 10 - 30 au from the sources",
    ", we are ruling out the possibility that the emission arises in extended halos surrounding the sources . the fact that in all four cases the h@xmath0 line emission is spatially unresolved is inconsistent with emission from a halo that should be many hundreds or thousands of au in extent .",
    "in addition , since the h@xmath0 emission lines appear to be spectrally resolved , the velocity line width of the gas also is inconsistent with a halo interpretation for the observed emission , for which we would expect line profiles with fwhm of only @xmath6 1 - 2 km s@xmath4 .",
    "line widths of this size would be unresolved at r  @xmath3  60,000 .",
    "while detection of h@xmath0 is important in establishing the continued presence of gas in the evolving circumstellar environment of tts , a determination of the exact amount of h@xmath0 gas still present has further reaching implications concerning the timescale for planet formation and/or the dispersal of the disk . making such",
    "a calculation requires understanding in what environments and under what conditions the h@xmath0 molecule can be excited into the _ v _ = 1 , _",
    "j _ = 3 state and what excitation mechanism(s ) is active in this environment .",
    "the v=1@xmath10  s(1 ) transition energy corresponds to a temperature of @xmath6  5000  k above the ground state .",
    "therefore , excitation temperatures between 1000  k and 2000  k typically are required in all types of astrophysical environments in order for h@xmath0 gas to populate the first vibrationally excited level and produce detectable levels of emission at 2.12183  @xmath2 m @xcite .    according to the disk model discussed in glassgold et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which includes x - ray heating , the _ outer surface layers _ of the disk may be heated to temperatures of 1000  k out to several au , while the midplane remains cool at @xmath6  100  k. hollenbach et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that temperatures of 1000  k produced by incident uv radiation are high enough to create photoevaporative flows that deplete disks on million year timescales .",
    "increasing the temperature to 2000  k would enhance the photoevaporation process , destroy the disks on even shorter timescales , and make detections of the emission we observed extremely rare or unlikely .",
    "we note that both possible stimulation mechanisms , uv fluorescence and x - ray ionization , are non - thermal processes .",
    "consequently , the gas producing the emission may not be in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "proceeding under the assumption that the source is optically thin , we can determine the mass of h@xmath0 emitting v=1@xmath10  s(1 ) line emission from the measured line flux , independent of temperature , from    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the line flux measured in ergs s@xmath4 @xmath32 ( column 9 , table  1 ) , @xmath33 is the energy and @xmath34 is the einstein coefficient for the transition , @xmath35 is the distance in pc to the source , and m(h@xmath0 ) is given in units of m@xmath12 .",
    "for the v=1@xmath10  s(1 ) transition , @xmath36 = 9.338  @xmath14  10@xmath37  ergs and @xmath38 = 2.09  @xmath14  10@xmath11  s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the derived masses are given in column 2 of table 2 .",
    "the next steps are to determine the population fraction @xmath39 , where _ v _ and _ j _ are the vibrational and rotational number for the upper level of the transition , respectively , for h@xmath0 in the excited state located in the upper atmosphere of the disk in the 10 - 30 au emission volume , and the mass fraction of the disk represented by this fractional part of the disk .",
    "one approach is to assume lte in which case the total mass in the emitting volume of the disk would be    @xmath40    under lte conditions at 1500  k , @xmath39  =  5.44  @xmath14  10@xmath41 and the masses range from 6.4@xmath1410@xmath42  m@xmath12 for tw hya to 8.1@xmath1410@xmath43  m@xmath12 for doar  21 ( column 3 , table  2 ) .",
    "if the gas is not in lte or is at a lower temperature , then @xmath44 would be smaller and the masses larger .",
    "as is evident from these calculations , the masses estimated from ` hot ' h@xmath0 are only small fractions of the total disk masses , based on comparisons with disk gas masses estimated from observations of warm h@xmath0 , cool dust , and cold co ( see table  2 ) . since the 2.12183 @xmath2 m observations of hot h@xmath0 do not likely sample gas present in the inner disk ( r@xmath4510  au ) , the dense midplane of the disk at 10 - 30 au , nor the disk outside of 30  au , what is needed is a ( temperature independent ) scaling factor , _ f _ , such that    @xmath46    just as canonical scaling factors have been determined for the mass ratio between dust and gas and for the number ratio of co and h@xmath0 , we have calculated _ f _ from equation ( 3 ) and the `` line emission '' masses in table  2 for our four stars to determine whether such a scale factor relating hot h@xmath0 to total disk mass can be derived by using previous estimates of m@xmath47 in table  2 .",
    "scale factors derived from masses implied by several different tracers of the total disk mass are listed in table  3 .",
    "the scale factors all fall within the range from @xmath610@xmath48 to @xmath610@xmath49 and suggest that we are detecting as little as one billionth of the total disk mass .",
    "the differences in these mass estimates , and therefore the range in _ f _ values , most likely arise because the various observations are sensitive to different reservoirs of material , with the ( sub)mm dust continuum consistently giving the largest _",
    "f _ values and the co and warm h@xmath0 smaller _ f _ values .",
    "the emission from h@xmath0 at 2.12183  @xmath2 m must arise from hot gas , at t  @xmath20  1000  k , which necessarily must reside near the surface of the disk and within a couple of tens of au of the star ( see  3.1 and  5 ) , while the millimeter continuum and co observations trace cooler gas at distances of 100s of au .",
    "given the location and density of the hot gas in comparison to the cool gas , it is reasonable to conclude that the tracers of the cooler gas will uncover much more mass than the hot gas tracer .",
    "if the hot gas is stimulated by non - thermal processes such as x - ray ionization and/or uv fluorescence , as we argue is likely in  5 , the near - infrared h@xmath0 line emission will be most sensitive to gas in the inner few tens of au of the disk . in the case of doar 21 for which previous non - detections of cold dust indicated that this star was largely void of circumstellar material",
    ", our detection of quiescent h@xmath0 emission at 2.12183 @xmath2 m suggests that a gaseous component in the inner few tens of au of the disk persists even after the cold gas tracers stop producing detectable levels of emission @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that high - resolution , near - infrared spectroscopy of h@xmath0 provides a means to detect evolved , low mass disks which may have no other observable signatures at this point in their evolution .",
    "h@xmath0 emission in the near - infrared has been observed in a variety of stellar environments such as planetary nebulae , herbig - haro objects , and galaxies .",
    "for example , h@xmath0 emission observed from planetary nebulae and hh objects is attributed to heating of molecular gas as it encounters shock fronts from outflows associated with the source .",
    "uv radiation produced in accretion flows or emitted by the sub - dwarf embedded in a pn can likewise stimulate h@xmath0 molecules located near these sources to fluoresce .",
    "near - infrared h@xmath0 emission also has been observed towards a seyfert galaxy , with x - rays suggested as the mechanism responsible for the excitation of the molecules @xcite .",
    "similarly , several authors have proposed that gas densities and x - ray luminosities in the environments of tts also are sufficient to produce h@xmath0 emission in the near - infrared , with the strongest transition being the v=1@xmath10 s(1 ) ro - vibration line @xcite .    with the high - resolution velocity information from our data placing the velocity of the gas at the systemic velocities of the stars with only a very small dispersion , and the spatial resolution of and spectral information from our data placing the h@xmath0 emission within a few tens of au of the respective stars ,",
    "we conclude that the observed emission is unlikely to originate from shock excitation in a yso outflow , for which typical outflow velocities are at least many tens of km  s@xmath4 and the shocked gas is most often observed at great distances from the stars .",
    "the fwhm velocity distribution for the observed emission lines , @xmath6  9 to 14  km  s@xmath4 , is larger than the thermal broadening expected from h@xmath0 , but not large enough to be produced by gas shocked by a jet , even for a jet aligned perpendicular to the line of sight with a small opening angle .",
    "for example , assuming an extremely small opening angle of @xmath6  4 , as has been observed for the outflow observed towards rw  aur @xcite , and a launch velocity of @xmath6  200  km  s@xmath4 , the h@xmath0 line would be broadened by @xmath3  10  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "even a tiny inclination angle of the jet toward our line of sight would increase the breadth of the line tremendously by creating blue- and red - shifted jets of gas .",
    "since all of our sources emission lines have similarly small fwhm , it is statistically reasonable to argue that most of these sources do not possess jets aligned nearly perpendicular to the line of sight , although conceivably one of the sources might be so aligned .",
    "therefore , we conclude that shock excitation in a stellar outflow is not likely to be the stimulating mechanism for most and probably not any of these sources",
    ".    since the observed line widths appear to rule out shocks in outflowing gas , the velocity dispersion in our line must be due only to thermal and/or orbital broadening , leaving ultraviolet pumping and x - ray ionization as candidate mechanisms for stimulating the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "ultraviolet pumping and x - ray ionization would serve to enhance the population of h@xmath0 molecules in excited states in the circumstellar disks of young stars via photon excitation ( uv ) or secondary interactions between h@xmath0 molecules and ions produced by x - ray ionization events . using the disk model found in glassgold et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and cross - sections for h@xmath0 molecules as `` seen '' by uv photons and x - rays determined from yan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we have calculated a set of optical depth surfaces in the disk , in the range 0.2  @xmath50  @xmath51  @xmath50  2 , to which photons of different energies and angles incident upon the inner disk would penetrate .",
    "the optical depth surfaces determined by our model assume a disk composed entirely of h@xmath0 molecules with incident photons originating at an inner radius of 0.35 au .",
    "although this model is simple , the results from our preliminary simulations ( bary , in prep ) suggest that both uv and x - ray photons could be responsible for the observed 2.1218  @xmath2 m emission .",
    "because the interaction cross - sections for the x - rays are much smaller than those for uv photons , x - rays will penetrate through a greater optical column than will uv photons .",
    "thus , some x - ray photons will penetrate deeper below the surface layer of the disk than will the uv photons and deposit their energy in regions of the disk in which the number densities are greater than 10@xmath8  cm@xmath41 ; such densities are too high to produce the observed h@xmath0 emission at radii less than 50 au . at these densities",
    ", excited h@xmath0 molecules will be collisionally de - excited .",
    "however , a significant fraction of the x - ray photons will be absorbed at the more shallow disk layers where the number density is below 10@xmath8  cm@xmath41 .",
    "the fraction of x - ray photons absorbed in regions of greater vs. smaller number density will depend on the exact physical shape ( flaring profile ) of the disk , the vertical density gradient in the disk , and the place of origin of the x - ray photons ( stellar surface or accretion funnels ) .",
    "a majority of uv photons incident upon the surface of the disk at distances between 10 and 30 au will be absorbed at distances of 5 - 10 au above the mid - plane , in a region of the disk where the number densities ( 10@xmath53  @xmath50  @xmath54  @xmath50  10@xmath8  cm@xmath41 ) are suitable for producing observable h@xmath0 emission at 2.12183  @xmath2 m .",
    "because both uv and x - ray photons are capable of penetrating to and being absorbed at depths and radii at which the observed line emission likely arises , in the following discussion , we examine both uv fluorescence and x - ray excitation models to determine if the flux of emission observed towards each source can be stimulated by either or both mechanisms .",
    "we now predict the flux of the v=1@xmath10 s(1 ) line emission using the models of x - ray excitation presented by maloney et al .",
    "for example , using the rosat measured x - ray flux from doar 21 , we determined the x - ray energy deposition rate per volume element h@xmath55/n to be 3 - 8  @xmath14  10@xmath56  ergs  s@xmath4  cm@xmath41 at a distance of 10 au from the source in a disk and assuming a number density line flux predicted to be stimulated by the x - rays will be observable .",
    "however , even if far less than 50% of the x - rays are absorbed in a less than critically dense region and the predicted line fluxes are cut in half , the x - ray mechanism still proves to be effective at producing most of the observed h@xmath0 emission from these sources . ] of 10@xmath57  cm@xmath41 .",
    "for this range in likely values of h@xmath55/n , we can estimate the emergent integrated surface brightness in the 1@xmath10 s(1 ) emission line from figure 6a of maloney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . assuming the emission emerges from an annulus in a circumstellar disk stretching from 10 to 30 au and at a distance of 160 pc , the predicted flux of the 1@xmath10 s(1 ) line",
    "lies in the range 2.4  @xmath14  10@xmath58 to 2.4  @xmath14  10@xmath59  ergs  s@xmath4  @xmath32 ( table  4 ) .",
    "the observed line flux falls within and near the top of this predicted range .",
    "thus , this calculation suggests that the observed emission could be attributed solely to x - ray excitation .",
    "similar results ( table  4 ) are found using the x - ray fluxes for gg tau , tw hya , and using an assumed x - ray flux for lkca  15 .",
    "thus , for the stars that are sources of x - rays , we have determined that x - rays are capable of stimulating the observed h@xmath0 emission at 2.12183  @xmath2 m .",
    "in fact , two of the four sources for which we have detected the quiescent h@xmath0 emission , doar  21 and tw  hya , are among the x - ray brightest tts ( column 6 , table  1 ) .",
    "however , gg  tau is considerably less x - ray luminous , while lkca  15 was not detected at all by rosat . if x - rays are important for stimulating the observed emission , we must understand why these four stars appear so different in observed x - ray emission .    historically , we know that most wtts are strong x - ray emitters , with many wtts having been discovered through extensive x - ray surveys of star forming regions ( e.g. , casanova et al .  1995 ;",
    "neuhuser et al .",
    "the apparent bimodal distribution of tts as x - ray sources , in which wtts were almost always detected and ctts were much less often detected , led to widespread acceptance that the x - ray emission mechanism was related to the evolution of the star / disk system . according to this scenario , x - ray emission from wtts is attributed to conservation of angular momentum and `` spinning up '' of the star as the magnetic field lines decouple from the dissipating circumstellar disk , allowing the forming star to contract @xcite . with the decrease in rotational period of the source , surface magnetic activity presumably increases . in turn , this process is expected to lead to an increase in coronal heating and the production of detectable levels of x - ray emission .",
    "thus for several years , x - ray emission was thought to distinguish wtts from ctts , with observational evidence suggesting that wtts were , indeed , fast rotators @xcite while ctts rotated more slowly due to disk - locking and therefore lacked the mechanism for x - ray production . with increasing statistics from large x - ray surveys , however , many ctts also have been found to be generating x - rays . since x - rays are no longer thought to distinguish ctts from wtts @xcite , it is no longer clear what mechanism produces x - rays in the yso environment .",
    "in addition , increasing evidence has called into question the existence of a bimodal rotation period distribution for wtts and ctts @xcite , with some authors now suggesting such a distribution applies only to tts in the mass range of about 0.25 - 1.0  m@xmath12 @xcite .    in recent work based on chandra spectra , kastner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) use the inferred plasma temperature distribution and the relative densities of iron , oxygen and neon deduced from high - resolution chandra x - ray spectroscopy to infer that the bulk of the x - ray emission from tw hya is generated via mass accretion from its circumstellar disk .",
    "if this is correct , and more so if this is a common mechanism for x - ray production , then x - ray bright tts  including wtts  would be those still accreting material from their disks .",
    "this interpretation is contrary to the common wisdom suggesting x - rays are dominantly from fast rotating wtts that are no longer accreting material from circumstellar disks and suggests that doar  21 , despite being a wtts , not only has h@xmath0 in a circumstellar disk , but may still be actively accreting material from a circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "we suggest that despite the absence of detectable levels of x - ray emission , lkca  15 could be accreting from a circumstellar disk ; however , because its thick disk is oriented nearly along our line of sight , the disk may absorb a significant fraction of the x - ray emission , thereby decreasing the x - ray flux that escapes the circumstellar region to a level that is below detection thresholds .",
    "a column of 10@xmath60 cm@xmath41 ( equivalent to a@xmath23  @xmath6  0.5 ; a@xmath23  @xmath6  0.64 for lkca  15 ( see table  5 ) ) is sufficient to decrease the flux from a source with an intrinsic x - ray luminosity of l@xmath55 = 3  @xmath14  10@xmath61  ergs  s@xmath4 to a count rate below 0.003  s@xmath4 , which is well below the detection threshold of the rosat all sky survey .",
    "a scenario such as this may explain the observed differences in x - ray fluxes from ctts and wtts , since most ctts are observed to have thicker disks more capable of attenuating the flux of x - rays produced within the inner boundary of the disks .    a star that previously has stood out as a notable exception to the absence of x - ray bright ctts is tw hya .",
    "tw hya has been imaged extensively at wavelengths ranging from the optical @xcite and near - infrared @xcite through the mm @xcite , and all of these observations indicate the presence of a face - on disk . therefore , in the case of tw hya , there is no line - of - sight gas and dust associated with the circumstellar disk of the star to attenuate the x - ray emission from the star .      in an attempt to determine whether that the uv flux ( f@xmath62 ) is capable of producing the observed h@xmath0 line flux , we compare observed and extrapolated values of f@xmath62 with those predicted from the models of black and van dishoeck ( 1987 ) . using the model for uv",
    "fluorescence found in black and van disheock ( 1987 ) , the predicted uv flux is given by    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the uv absorption efficiency , _",
    "f_@xmath65 is the fraction of the total infrared flux emitted in the the 2.12183  @xmath2 m emission line , @xmath66 is the solid angle of the disk that intercepts the stellar uv flux and f@xmath67 is the observed h@xmath0 line flux in erg  s@xmath4  @xmath32 . using the scale height of the disk at a distance of 30 au from the source , we conservatively estimate @xmath68 to be @xmath27  0.1 since uv photons are likely to be absorbed at distances above the midplane that are larger than the scale height .",
    "the model dependent uv absorption efficiencies and line fractions were chosen from models 12 and 15 from black and van dishoeck ( 1987 ) to provide a wide range of predicted uv fluxes .    of the four sources ,",
    "tw  hya is the only star that has been observed in the wavelength range , 925 - 1130  , which are the wavelengths of interest because only photons with @xmath69  @xmath15  1130    possess the right energy to produce infrared h@xmath0 fluorescent emission .",
    "far ultraviolet space explorer _ fuse _ observations ( herczeg , private communication ) show that the uncorrected line and continuum fluxes for tw  hya have nearly the same magnitude when integrated over the wavelengths 925 - 1130  . using equation ( 4 )",
    ", we predict a range of 6.6  @xmath14  10@xmath70  @xmath15  f@xmath62  @xmath15  4.8  @xmath14  10@xmath42  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath32 for the value of uv flux from tw  hya necessary to stimulate the observed h@xmath0 line emission . using the sum of the integrated _ fuse _ continuum flux and the line fluxes ( ciii at 977  , o viii at 1032 and 1038   ) for tw  hya",
    "we estimate that the model dependent uv flux is responsible for 1% to 20% of the observed h@xmath0 line emission at 2.12183 @xmath2 m .    for the other sources",
    ", we converted the _ u _ magnitude for each star to a flux at 3620  . assuming the stars radiate as blackbodies with temperatures indicated by their main - sequence spectral types , we extrapolated the 3620   flux to 1000  . by comparing the theoretical f@xmath62 for tw  hya to the observed value of f@xmath62",
    ", we can determine if the extrapolation method accurately predicts the uv continuum flux . for tw  hya , we determined f@xmath62 to be about 3  @xmath14  10@xmath71  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath32 , about five orders of magnitude less than the level observed by _ fuse_. we conclude that the extrapolation method for determining f@xmath62 is a poor predictor of the stellar uv flux .",
    "therefore , for doar  21 , lkca  15 , and gg  tau , without _ fuse _ observations we can only surmise that their f@xmath62 spectra may be similar to that of tw  hya and , thus , that their actual levels of f@xmath62 may be capable of stimulating at least part of the observed 2.12183  @xmath2 m line emission .",
    "the results of the uv fluorescence model suggest that a significant fraction of the infrared h@xmath0 emission may be produced via uv photo - excitation for each star .",
    "however , the model is not well constrained .",
    "for example , uv emission can be absorbed by circumstellar and interstellar gas , in which case , the uv line and continuum fluxes would be lower limits . predicting the uv flux necessary to produce the 2.12183 @xmath2 m line flux is complicated by the narrow range of densities for which the efficiencies and line fractions have been calculated .",
    "in addition , black and van dishoeck ( 1987 ) assume a plane parallel cloud of gas with a constant density ; in our case we used 3  @xmath14  10@xmath72  cm@xmath41 , while in a realistic circumstellar disk there will be a density gradient with the outer layers of the disk having lower densities and the inner layers of the disk having much higher densities .",
    "as shown in black and van dishoeck  ( 1987 ) , the efficiencies can be affected greatly by the column and space densities of the gas .",
    "ultraviolet excesses associated with pre - main - sequence stars normally are attributed to active accretion of disk material onto a forming star .",
    "thus , if x - rays are produced in accretion flows one would expect to find that those same sources show ultraviolet excesses .",
    "we have calculated _",
    "u@xmath73v _ color excesses towards the h@xmath0 detected sources ( table  5 ) by dereddening their _ u _ and _ v _ magnitudes and comparing the observed , dereddened _",
    "u@xmath73v _ colors with standard main - sequence colors @xcite . using the photometry of gg tau aa and ab from ghez et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we determined a value for the excess of each component of the northern binary .",
    "tw  hya , doar  21 , and gg  tau  aa and gg  tau  ab all have significant excesses with [ _ u_@xmath73_v_]@xmath74  @xmath19  @xmath731.3 .",
    "lkca 15 appears to have a smaller , but significant , ultraviolet excess . on this basis",
    "we conclude that each of these sources may still be undergoing active accretion and producing excess uv emission that could be responsible for stimulating some of the observed h@xmath0 emission",
    ".    a closer look at the ultraviolet excesses from tw  hya and lkca  15 suggests a possible dependence of [ _ u_@xmath73_v_]@xmath74 on the inclination angle of the disk . the nearly edge - on disk of lkca  15 may absorb a significant fraction of the ultraviolet emission produced in the accretion process , just as suggested for the attenuation of its x - ray flux . on the other hand ,",
    "tw  hya , which has been imaged and shown to be viewed nearly pole - on , produces the largest value of [ _ u_@xmath73_v_]@xmath74 of any of these four sources .",
    "based on the shape of the h@xmath0 emission line from doar  21 , we inferred @xcite the orientation of its disk to be more pole - on ( _ i _  @xmath20  55 ) than that of lkca  15 ; such an orientation is consistent with the larger value of [ _ u_@xmath73_v_]@xmath74 found for doar  21 than for lkca  15 . due to the complexity of the gg  tau system , with both circumbinary and circumstellar material , we are unable to relate the [ _ u_@xmath73_v_]@xmath74 values for these stars to disk orientation in any meaningful manner . while our sample remains small so that we lack the statistical certainty that could prove the existence of a correlation between the strength of [ _ u_@xmath73_v_]@xmath74 and disk orientation , such a possible correlation is intriguing and consistent with the data presented .",
    "near - infrared broad band photometry of ysos previously has been used to identify sources that are likely candidates for harboring circumstellar disks . in this section ,",
    "we examine infrared color - color diagrams to determine if there exists a correlation between the infrared excess , the implied presence of a circumstellar disk and the observed h@xmath0 emission .",

    "lada et al .",
    "( 2000 ) explain that the _ jhk _ near - infrared excess depends on the star / disk system ( i.e. , disk inclination , accretion rate , presence and size of holes in the inner disk ) and also may be produced by emission from hii regions and reflection nebulae usually associated with star forming regions .",
    "_ l _ band observations , however , are much less sensitive to emission from hii regions and scattered light from reflection nebulae and will measure infrared excess emission from circumstellar disks independent of the star / disk system .",
    "therefore , an infrared excess observed using _",
    "jhkl _ photometry can be characterized more confidently as being produced by a circumstellar disk . to this end ,",
    "band surveys are being conducted to determine disk fractions in many nearby young star clusters @xcite .    using _ jhkl _ observations made by rydgren et al .",

    "several detections of h@xmath0 in the vicinity of young stellar objects have been made in recent years . as previously mentioned , _ iso _ observations of herbig ae / be stars and ctts claim to have detected pure rotational emission from h@xmath0 in the vicinity of these stars @xcite",
