    "a host of interactions play a role in determining the properties of complex quantum materials .",
    "foremost among these are interactions among the electron quasiparticles , and between electron quasiparticles and bosonic excitations such as phonons and spin fluctuations . quantifying these interactions is essential to understanding the fundamental and emergent phenomena in complex materials . in particular , in strongly correlated materials the phenomenology of these interactions remains vital to understanding the behavior of charge and spin density waves , electrical conductivity anomalies and unconventional superconductivity .",
    "however , the analysis is challenging because different experimental methods can easily lead to different conclusions .",
    "the difficulty primarily arises because the interactions overlap in energy , making them difficult to disentangle .",
    "interactions quite generally give rise to the quasiparticle lifetime , or equivalently an excitation energy linewidth .",
    "these lifetimes are described by the energy dependent imaginary part of the quasiparticle self - energy , @xmath3(@xmath4 ) , which represents the effect of the interactions on the quasiparticle at energy @xmath4 and determines various properties of the material .",
    "each of the interactions has a specific contribution to @xmath3 which in equilibrium add to result in a total linewidth according to matthiessen s rule .",
    "this superposition of single particle self energies complicates the disentanglement of the individual interactions , which is desirable to be able to understand the electron - boson ( e - b ) and electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions .",
    "quasiparticle lifetimes or their mass renormalizations can in some cases be directly measured using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) by studying the linewidth @xmath5 or effective dispersion @xmath6 , obtaining the imaginary or real parts of the self - energy ( @xmath3  and @xmath7 ) , respectively @xcite recently , femtosecond time - resolved arpes ( tr - arpes ) @xcite has come to the forefront as another method for studying the quasiparticle lifetimes through analyzing population dynamics , and thus ostensibly the interactions . in these experiments ,",
    "an ultrafast laser pump excites quasiparticles from their ground state , and their subsequent energy- and momentum - resolved relaxation to equilibrium is probed by analysis of the photoelectron spectrum generated by a second , much weaker , time - delayed probe pulse in the uv or xuv spectral range .",
    "the lifetime analysis of the laser excited population relaxation by kinetic rate equations or density matrix formalism @xcite has proven successful for quasiparticle energies between approximately 0.5 to several ev in a limit where relaxation is dominant at all times and quasiparticle lifetimes can indeed be determined in the time domain .",
    "@xcite at energies close to the fermi level @xmath8 the situation is more challenging because two effects become important and hamper the lifetime determination .",
    "there the various interactions do not simply add to determine the population dynamics @xcite .",
    "here we propose to exploit this seeming complication to separate the microscopic interactions of interest using population dynamics observed in tr - arpes . immediately after the pump",
    ", the primary electronic excitations relax by e - e scattering , which leads to a population redistribution of secondary electronic excitations .",
    "subsequently , coupling to phonons becomes in general the dominant contribution @xcite . as a result , the electron - phonon ( e - p ) coupling leaves its fingerprint on the population dynamics .    in this work , we show that microscopic conclusions can be drawn from this particular fingerprint . using tr - arpes , we observe population relaxation dynamics which we describe by interaction with a specific phonon after excitation by a light field .",
    "we apply this analysis to the model conducting system bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2(bi2212 ) , which is a good candidate because it exhibits pronounced e - p scattering at discrete and well - known energies@xcite .",
    "we find quantitative agreement between experiment and theory . by explicit inclusion of the pump light field in our theoretical description as the primary electronic excitation mechanism ,",
    "we avoid the assumption of an initially thermalized electronic distribution which was required in previous work @xcite .",
    "the population dynamics are calculated using a numerical time - dependent green s function approach.@xcite the photoexcited electrons scatter on an ultrashort time scale by e - e interactions .",
    "because these interactions conserve the total electronic energy in the electron system , they can not be responsible for the dissipation of the excess electronic energy .",
    "the dissipation is achieved by electron - phonon ( e - p ) interactions which transfer the energy from the electron system via the @xmath9  mev phonon to a heat bath representing acoustic phonons .",
    "we validate this assertion by a comparison between the tr - arpes measurements and a theoretical calculation which only includes e - p interactions in the relaxation dynamics .",
    "a measurement of population dynamics on the copper - oxide material bi2212 in its normal state is used both because this material is known to host very strong e - b interactions throughout its phase diagram  @xcite and to demonstrate the ability of our approach to discern such interactions even when obscured by other physics , as is the case in the normal state of bi2212.@xcite the experimentally observed relaxation dynamics exhibit two characteristic timescales , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , of which @xmath10 exhibits a sudden speedup at energies above @xmath12 for the lowest pump fluence used .",
    "the newly discovered short timescale @xmath13 is found to account for a large part of the lifetime obtained from the equilibrium line width @xmath14 measured near @xmath15along the zone diagonal . by comparison to theory ,",
    "we show that these time scales can arise from the coupling to a single phonon , namely the 75 @xmath16 @xmath17 breathing mode@xcite .",

    "[ fig : scatt_compare ]    we begin with some general remarks regarding the dynamics of population distributions when driven out of equilibrium . the pump deposits energy into the electrons .",
    "if e - e interactions are the only interactions present , the excess energy must remain in the electronic system , and although the scattering can cause a rapid change in the energy and momentum dependent population , it can only thermalize the electrons at a higher temperature determined by the absorbed energy .",
    "however , a coupling to a bosonic bath of phonons can draw out the energy by transferring it to the lattice , which has a larger heat capacity than the electronic system .",
    "the determining factor for the dynamics is then the rate at which e - p scattering dissipates the energy , which depends critically on the e - p coupling strength and the phonon frequencies .",
    "the full dynamics of this process , including e - e and e - p interactions , involves a complex interplay beyond this simple model . energy relaxation of the photoexcited carrier population is expected to occur on three distinct timescales  @xcite ( i ) electron population redistribution on a femtosecond timescale mediated by e - e scattering ; ( ii ) transfer of energy from the electrons to strongly coupled phonons on a tens- to hundreds of femtoseconds timescale ; and ( iii ) full system thermalization on picosecond or longer timescales , on which the excited population of the strongly coupled phonons decays through anharmonic coupling or transport . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatt_compare ] we illustrate processes ( i ) and ( ii ) , which are the relevant ones for the short term dynamics .",
    "the measured and calculated time traces typically show a rise at @xmath23 , followed by a decay .",
    "the dynamics are determined by a combination of processes ( i ) and ( ii ) , where e - p and e - e scattering cooperate in a non - additive fashion to equilibrate the electrons with each other as well as with the phonon bath .",
    "however , only e - p interactions can carry energy away from the electrons in a non - magnetic system .    to show that the e - p scattering is the determining factor in the return to equilibrium , we performed simulations of the pump - probe process using non - equilibrium keldysh green s functions .",
    "we treat the e - p and e - e interactions self - consistently , with both interactions being evaluated at second order in perturbation theory . here",
    ", we go beyond previous work@xcite and include the effects of e - e scattering in second order self - consistently .",
    "we calculate the time - dependent density @xmath24 along the zone diagonal after excitation by a short 1.5  ev pump pulse for a simple nearest - neighbor tight - binding model and then fit the time traces with a single exponential . to illustrate that the resulting decay rates reflect the e - p scattering even when e - e scattering is present , we obtain the decay rates for various e - e scattering strengths ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "[ fig : scatt_compare]b shows the decay rates obtained for quasiparticles at energy @xmath4 above @xmath8 .",
    "the rates without e - e scattering show a step at the phonon frequency@xcite .",
    "strikingly , even when the e - e scattering is increased beyond the e - p scattering strength ( @xmath25 ) , the step remains visible in the data .",
    "we also note that the high - energy decay rate is smaller when e - e scattering is present , suggesting that there is some competition between the two processes .",
    "this originates from the fact that the population dynamics is a fundamentally different quantity than the dynamics ( and therefore lifetime ) of a singly - excited quasiparticle .",
    "the latter is determined by the wavefunction decay , and the former by the interactions the quasiparticles with each other and with external phonons .",
    "we now demonstrate that this analysis can be applied in real materials by making a quantitative comparison between theoretical simulations of the type shown above and a tr - arpes experiment .",
