    "<S> in the nucleon electroexcitation reactions , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a nucleon resonance ( @xmath2 ) , the electric amplitude @xmath3 , and the longitudinal amplitude @xmath4 , are related by @xmath5 , in the pseudo - threshold limit ( @xmath6 ) , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively the energy and the magnitude of three - momentum of the photon . </S>",
    "<S> the previous relation is usually refereed to as the siegert s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the electric amplitude , defined in terms of the transverse amplitudes @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the explicit coefficients of the relation , depend on the angular momentum and parity ( @xmath11 ) of the resonance @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the siegert s theorem is the consequence of the structure of the electromagnetic transition current , which induces constraints between the electromagnetic form factors in the pseudo - threshold limit . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we study the implications of the siegert s theorem for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 transitions . for the @xmath13 transition , </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the relation between electric amplitude and longitudinal amplitude , we also obtain a relation between the two transverse amplitudes : @xmath14 , at the pseudo - threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints at the pseudo - threshold are tested for the maid2007 parametrizations of the reactions under discussion . </S>",
    "<S> new parametrizations for the amplitudes @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath4 , for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 transitions , valid for small and large @xmath15 , are proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the new parametrizations are consistent with both : the pseudo - threshold constraints ( siegert s theorem ) and the empirical data . </S>"
