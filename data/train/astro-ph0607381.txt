    "one of the most spectacular phenomena associated with accretion onto black holes is the creation of powerful , highly - relativistic jets .",
    "however , despite intense observational and theoretical study , the basic energy source of these relativistic jets remains unknown .",
    "broadly speaking , there are two possibilities .",
    "firstly , jets could be powered by the liberation of gravitational potential energy of accreting matter .",
    "if this is the case , the most likely scenario is the formation and subsequent focusing and acceleration of a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) disk wind ( blandford & payne 1982 ) . while this mechanism has the appealing feature of potentially being universal to all accreting systems ( and therefore allowing a unified model for jets from proto - stellar systems , accreting white dwarfs and accreting neutron stars as well as accreting black holes ) , it is not clear that such a disk wind can be accelerated to the highly relativistic velocities seen from many black hole systems .",
    "the alternative is that jets could be powered by the magnetic extraction of the spin energy of the central black hole using the mechanism described in the seminal paper by blandford & znajek ( 1977 ; hereafter bz ) .",
    "the power extracted from a kerr black hole with dimensionless spin parameter @xmath0 threaded by a magnetic field of strength @xmath1 ( in the membrane paradigm sense ; see thorne , price & macdonald 1986 ) is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the radius of the event horizon and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the angular velocities of the black hole and magnetic field lines , respectively .",
    "it is often argued ( e.g. , see bz ) that the magnetic field structure adjusts itself such that @xmath7 ( phinney 1983 ) , hence maximizing @xmath8 to a value of @xmath9 .",
    "while the initial work of bz was based on force - free black hole magnetospheres , the basic mechanism is seen to operate in the recent generation of fully relativistic mhd accretion disk simulations ( e.g. , see koide et al .",
    "2000 ; komissarov 2004 , de  villiers et al .",
    "2004 , mckinney & gammie 2004 , mckinney 2005a , b , c )    in the past dozen years or so , several studies have cast doubt on whether nature can produce significant hole - threading magnetic fields , leading to the suggestion that the bz mechanism is insufficient to energize powerful black hole jets . developing upon work done by van ballegooijen ( 1989 ) , lubow , papaloizou & pringle ( 1994 ) and heyvaerts , priest & bardou ( 1996 ; hereafter hpb ) have examined the dragging and concentration of an external field by an mhd turbulent accretion disk .",
    "both sets of authors find that , due to the high effective magnetic diffusivity of such disks , the inward dragging and subsequent concentration of an external field is rather ineffective . in a different approach to this problem , ghosh & abramowicz ( 1997 ; hereafter ga97 ) construct force - free black hole magnetosphere models within the radius of marginal stability and show that the field threading the black hole is only of comparable strength to that threading the inner disk . since the disk - threading field has to be rather weak ( with the magnetic pressure at least an order of magnitude less than the total pressure ) so as not to quench the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) that drives the accretion itself ( balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 ) , the inferred black hole threading field would be insufficient to energize the powerful jets in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) that we observe .",
    "this argument was further developed by livio , ogilvie & pringle ( 1999 ) who pointed out that , under these circumstances , the electromagnetic power extracted from the inner regions of the disk would necessarily dominate the black hole spin - energy extraction .    in all of the studies described above",
    ", the plunge region of the black hole accretion disk has been neglected .",
    "this is the region of the disk within the radius of marginal stability in which the accretion flow is undergoing rapid inwards acceleration ( ultimately crossing the event horizon at the velocity of light as seen by a locally non - rotating observer ) .",
    "unless the magnetic field is extremely strong , this is a region where inertial forces will dominate and the commonly employed force - free approximation will break down . for example , examination of the ga97 steady - state magnetosphere solution shows magnetic field crossing the plunge region with a strength very similar to that in the diffusive region of the disk .",
    "this situation seems unlikely  any dynamically unimportant magnetic field that threads the plunge - region would be swept into the black hole on a dynamical timescale .",
    "this means that the actual field threading the plunge region would be very weak .",
    "however , it does not imply that the field threading the bh horizon , which is what counts for the bz effect , is also weak .",
    "the field swept in by the plunge region would be `` cleaned '' into some well - ordered configuration threading the black hole ( for a full discussion of the `` cleaning '' of a magnetic field by a black hole , see thorne , price & mcdonald 1986 ) and can be confined by the inertial forces of the plunging accretion flow even if it achieves strengths appreciably higher than the characteristic field strengths in the inner disk . since the strength of the bz mechanism depends on the square of the magnetic field , this enhancement could have major implications for the relative dominance of spin - energy extraction .    in this paper",
    ", we extend these previous works by examining the role of the plunge region of a black hole accretion disk in enhancing the horizon - threading flux . in essence",
    ", we use the hpb formalism for flux dragging in an accretion disk and impose an inner boundary condition appropriate for the plunge region around a central black hole .",
    "this formalism is described in section  2 .",
    "although this analysis is non - relativistic , it should provide guidance about flux enhancement by the plunge region at least in the case of slowly rotating black holes . as reported in section 3 ,",
    "our analysis confirms the basic intuition discussed in the previous paragraph and uncovers a strong dependence of the equilibrium trapped flux on the disk thickness and the effective magnetic prandtl number of the disk .",
    "section  4 discusses the sensitivity of our results to the outer boundary condition and then places our results into a wider astrophysical context .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "we follow the approach of hpb to study the dragging of an external magnetic field by an mhd turbulent accretion disk .",
    "as already noted , this results in a non - relativistic model but should be able to provide quantitative insights on the behavior of slowly rotating black holes ( where the radius of marginal stability is in a rather low gravitational redshift regime ) . we consider a thin keplerian accretion disk with geometric thickness @xmath10 extending down to the radius of marginal stability at @xmath11 . we suppose that the disk has an effective magnetic diffusivity ( due to reconnection in the mhd turbulence ) of @xmath12 which is comparable to the effective viscosity @xmath13 .",
    "in other words , the effective magnetic prandtl number @xmath14 is of order unity ( see hpb for an explicit justification of @xmath15 ) . note that we employ the standard definition of @xmath16 as the ratio of the viscosity to the magnetic diffusivity which is the reciprocal of that used in lubow et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and hpb .",
    "we now suppose that an external uniform magnetic field with strength @xmath17 is present in the vertical direction ( i.e. , aligned with the normal to the accretion disk ) .",
    "we are interested in the dragging of this field by the accretion flow . assuming the system remains axisymmetric at all times , and employing cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath18 , the poloidal magnetic field structure is completely described by the flux function @xmath19 via @xmath20 .",
    "with such a definition , the magnetic flux threading a ring of radius @xmath21 at height @xmath22 from the disk plane is @xmath23 and the magnetic field components are given by @xmath24 the flux function can be decomposed into three components , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the flux function associated with cleaned black hole - threading field ( generated by currents in the disk ) , the final term on the rhs is just the uniform imposed flux ( generated by currents at infinity ) , and @xmath27 accounts for all other ( disk - threading ) magnetic field structures ( generated , in principle , by currents either in or out of the disk plane ) .",
    "for definiteness we suppose that , in the region exterior to the disk ( @xmath28 ) , the black hole - threading field has the form of a split monopole , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is @xmath31 times the total hole - threading flux . to reiterate , this hole - threading field is generated by toroidal currents flowing in the disk ( @xmath32 ) and is a vacuum solution to maxwell s equations elsewhere . while the precise structure of the cleaned black hole field is unclear , the choice of the split monopole has support from recent general relativistic mhd simulations ( e.g. , see hirose et al . , 2004 ; komissarov 2005 ) .",
    "hpb showed that the time evolution of the flux function in the diffusive part of the disk plane , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , is given by @xmath35=0 , \\label{eqn : init_evol}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the radial velocity of the accretion flow .",
    "the @xmath37 term represents the effect of magnetic tension due to the curvature of field lines across the disk plane , and thus depends on the structure of the magnetic field above and below the disk . for example",
    ", one could formulate steady - state mhd wind solutions which take the instantaneous value of @xmath33 as a boundary condition .",
    "this would be a task of great complexity ( note that the radial structure of the boundary condition would not admit self - similar wind solutions ) . here , we make the following simplifications .",
    "firstly , we assume that the magnetic field outside of the disk ( hereafter referred to as the disk magnetosphere ) is force - free , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "secondly , we assume that the alfvn speed in the disk magnetosphere is sufficiently high as to reduce the toroidal field to essentially zero ( through the production of torsional alfvn waves ) . setting @xmath39 ,",
    "the field in the disk magnetosphere becomes potential ( @xmath40 ) and the flux function obeys @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the linear differential operator @xmath43 noting that both the imposed uniform field and ( exterior to the disk ) the black hole - threading field @xmath26 individually obey @xmath44 , the structure of the disk magnetosphere is determined by solving the potential problem for @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath45 .    at this point , a brief discussion of our @xmath46 assumption ( which leads to the potential field condition ) is in order . in the non - relativistic treatment here , we can always assume that the alfvn speed in the disk magnetosphere is large enough such that any twist in the magnetic field is removed via a torsional alfvn wave .",
    "however , our intent is to produce a toy - model for accretion onto a black hole so we should be wary of an assumption that so explicitly relies on non - relativistic physics . in a fully relativistic treatment , the force - free magnetosphere around a black hole accretion disk",
    "would be described by the grad - shafranov equation ( bz ; macdonald & thorne 1982 ; uzdensky 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "it is found that the poloidal field structure depends on both the poloidal current distribution ( which gives rise to toroidal fields ) and the field line rotation ( due to the fact that the field lines are frozen into an orbiting accretion disk , for example ) . in particular , the field structure is affected by the presence of an inner and outer light cylinder .",
    "ultimately , a relativistic version of our model should study the flux dragging and the magnetization of the black hole including these physical effects . here",
    ", we simply note that detailed studies of non - rotating ( or slowly - rotating ) black hole magnetospheres have shown that the field line rotation associated with a keplerian accretion disk has only a small effect on the poloidal field as compared with the equivalent non - rotating configuration ( macdonald 1984 ; uzdensky 2004 ) . in this sense ,",
    "keplerian accretion disks are `` slow rotators '' ( uzdensky 2004 ) .    for the rest of this paper",

    "the inclusion of the dead - zone makes the evolution of the inner part of the system essentially independent of the position or exact nature of the @xmath72 boundary .",
    "in particular , the dead zone acts as a reservoir of magnetic flux that can feed the actively accreting part of the disk  only in the outermost parts of the active disk does the conservation of magnetic flux lead to a non - negligible magnetic pressure trying to `` suck '' magnetic flux out of the active disk .",
    "the physical nature of the dead zone will be discussed in section  4 .",

    "our calculations show that the magnetic field at @xmath124 is essentially just the imposed uniform field .",

    "[ eqn : evol ] for @xmath140 , @xmath97 and @xmath141 reveals that the enhancement of the magnetic flux increases with @xmath142 slightly more slowly than the linear relationship predicted by our simple arguments in this section . since the implementation of the dead zone is one of most artificial aspects of our toy model , we will not explore this dependence in any more detail in this paper . in real systems ,",
    "the dead zone might be identified with the outer edge of the mhd turbulence dominated accretion disk , e.g. , the self - gravity region in an agn disk or the tidal truncation radius for the disk in a galactic black hole binary ( gbhb ) .",
    "both of these radii are likely to be at significantly larger radius than @xmath97 used here . alternatively ,",
    "if the magnetosphere is treated using a full mhd wind model , the crucial length - scale which determines the magnetic field enhancement is likely be the vertical height of the alfvnic surface .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to address such models .",
    "however , our approach allows us to illustrate an essential point ; that the inward dragging of magnetic field over some region of the inner disk coupled with the existence of the plunge region allows a significant enhancement in the strength of the magnetic field threading the black hole .",
    "before discussing the astrophysical implications of our result , we must address the three major limitations of our approach .",
    "first , we have made no attempt to include relativistic effects ( beyond our simple treatment of the radius of marginal stability ) on the dynamics or electrodynamics of the disk / field system .",
    "our model is an adequate representation for slowly spinning black holes ( where the radius of marginal stability is rather large and in a comparatively low - gravity region of spacetime ) , but we acknowledge that a full relativistic electrodynamic treatment is required to robustly treat the case of rapidly rotating black holes",
    ". while the same basic phenomenon of magnetic flux trapping by the plunge region should be at work around rapidly rotating black holes , the geometry of the system ( i.e. , the fact that the radius of marginal stability is much closer to the event horizon ) might be unfavorable for producing dramatic enhancements in the black hole - threading magnetic field . on the other hand , an ergospheric wind ( punsly & coroniti 1990 ; punsly 1991 ) could aid in the production of a strong poloidal field ( through the inertial effects of the outflowing plasma ) as well as the inward dragging of field ( through the removal of angular momentum from the accretion flow ) .",
    "second , we assume the existence of a pre - existing large scale magnetic field .",
    "the origin of such a field depends upon the system under consideration . for the accreting black hole at the heart of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) collapsar ,",
    "such a field may arise naturally from the collapsed stellar envelope . in the case of agn , the field corresponds to that of the accreting interstellar medium . for gbhbs ,",
    "the presence of a large scale field probably depends on the mode of accretion , with wind - accretors likely possessing a much stronger and better organized large scale field than roche - lobe overflow accretors .",
    "third , we assume axisymmetric large scale fields with a disk magnetosphere consisting of force - free and purely poloidal field .",
    "as mentioned in section  2 , a more physical treatment would entail matching an mhd wind solution to the disk - plane flux function .",
    "with such an approach , one could capture the inertial effects of a disk outflow on the field structure , the hoop stresses resulting from any toroidal fields present , and the angular momentum losses in the disk due to the wind .",
    "these could have competing effects on the ultimate ability of the disk to drag the field into the plunge region .",
    "the inertial effects will tend to bend the field lines outwards , increasing the field - line curvature at the disk plane and hence increasing outward diffusion of the field .",
    "the loss of disk angular momentum to the wind , on the other hand , would lead to an increase in the radial velocity of the accretion flow but no change in the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "this , in turn , increases the inwards advection of the magnetic field .",
    "clearly , more detailed calculations of this scenario are warranted .",
    "as for the axisymmetric assumption , we note that spruit & uzdensky ( 2005 ) have recently examined the dragging of a large scale magnetic field by an accretion disk under the assumption that the mhd turbulence in the disk concentrates the field into small bundles ( giving rise to the accretion disk equivalent of sun spots ) . through an analysis of the dynamics of these bundles ,",
    "they conclude that this is a generally favorable scenario for accumulating a large amount of magnetic flux in the central regions of the disk .",
    "thus , in at least one specific model , an extreme deviation from axisymmetry aids in the inward dragging of magnetic flux .",
    "we reiterate that the principal result of this paper is that the existence of a plunge region together with magnetic field dragging in the accretion disk can significantly enhance the black hole - threading magnetic field and hence the bz effect .",
    "furthermore , the enhancement becomes increasing effective for thicker disks or higher magnetic prandtl numbers .",
    "however , we acknowledge that the caveats given above , together with the dependence of the enhancement on the size of the dead zone , prevents us from further quantifying the enhancement .",
    "given the caveats discussed above , the results of section  3 have important implications for the strength of the black hole - threading field and the relevance of the bz process .",
    "suppose that the magnetic pressure due to the large scale field @xmath17 is a fraction @xmath143 of the maximum pressure in the accretion disk , @xmath144 , i.e. , @xmath145 .",
    "using this together with eqn .",
    "[ eqn : bz ] and eqn .",
    "[ eqn : bhfield ] gives , @xmath146 .",
    "using the expressions for @xmath144 for radiation pressure - dominated ( rpd ) and gas pressure - dominated ( gpd ) disks from moderski & sikora ( 1996 ) and ga97 , and assuming the usual bz impedance matching criterion is obeyed , gives @xmath147 where we have scaled to a black hole mass of @xmath148 and @xmath149 is the mass accretion rate in eddington units .",
    "this can be directly compared with the expressions for @xmath150 in ga97 if we set @xmath151 ( which results from their relation between @xmath68 and the disk magnetic field ) . for @xmath152 ( corresponding to small effective magnetic prandtl numbers or very thin disks )",
    ", we find low bz luminosities that agree very well with those computed by ga97 .",
    "however , as we have shown , large magnetic prandtl numbers and/or thick disks can result in large enhancements of the black hole - threading fields , approximately described by @xmath153 , where @xmath154 .",
    "the bz luminosity is then enhanced by a factor of @xmath155 .",
    "it is interesting to explore astrophysical consequences of the strong @xmath63 dependence of the equilibrium hole - threading flux @xmath104 .",
    "there is mounting empirical evidence that black hole systems produce jets only when a geometrically thick accretion disk is present .",
    "the best case can be made for the gbhbs , as discussed by fender , belloni & gallo ( 2004 ) . in their x - ray low - hard ( lh )",
    "state ( a.k.a .",
    "the power - law state ; mcclintock & remillard 2004 ) they display steady optically - thick radio cores which , in cygnus x-1 , can be spatially resolved into a jet - like structure by vlba ( stirling et al .",
    "it is generally believed that the inner regions of the accretion flow in a lh - state gbhb system is radiatively inefficient , hot , and hence geometrically - thick ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "however , the radio jet is seen to shut off once the source has made a transition to the high - soft ( hs ) state ( or thermal state ; mcclintock & remillard 2004 ) which is believed to correspond to an inner accretion disk which is radiatively efficient and hence significantly thinner .",
    "we postulate that the jet in the lh state is powered by the bz effect which is enhanced by the flux trapping effect of the plunge region .",
    "some time after a transition to a hs state , the system will possess a disk with a similar accretion rate but significantly reduced thickness .",
    "for a fixed accretion rate , the maximum pressure in a disk scales as @xmath157 . using our parameterization for @xmath158",
    ", we expect the bz luminosity scales as @xmath159 , provided @xmath160 .",
    "hence , due to the inability of a thin disk to trap flux on the black hole , the bz luminosity of the hs state will be much reduced leading to the suppression of the radio jet .",
    "the actual @xmath161 transition itself is particularly interesting .",
    "it is during this transition ( when the source crosses the `` jet line '' on the x - ray flux / color diagram ) that powerful relativistic outflows are produced which , for example , produce the superluminal radio blobs seen from microquasars .",
    "it is likely that the transition is driven by the thermal collapse of the lh - state hot disk , producing a structure that eventually evolves into the hs - state cold disk .",
    "the nature of the intermediate structure is unclear , however .",
    "it has been suggested that the thermal collapse produces a magnetically - dominated region ( e.g. , meier 2005 ) in which mri - driven turbulence is suppressed and accretion proceeds only through large scale magnetic torques . if the pre - collapse disk is threaded by a large scale magnetic field , this field could readily become dynamically important in the post - collapse disk ( since rapid thermal collapse will proceed at constant surface density , producing a disk pressure which scales as @xmath162 ) .",
    "subsequent magnetic braking of the disk would lead to rapid inflow , a rapid accretion of poloidal flux onto the black hole , and a rapid increase in the importance of the bz effect .",
    "the powerful ejections seen from gbhbs as they undergo this transition might be the result of such a scenario .",
    "the ejections would terminate once the inner disk has ceased to be magnetically dominated ( due to the accretion of matter from the outer disk ) , hence re - establishing a turbulent state with high effective magnetic diffusivity .",
    "black hole rotation is , in principle , a more than sufficient source of energy for energizing even the most powerful relativistic jets .",
    "the viability of magnetic extraction of black hole spin energy does , however , hinge on the strength of the horizon - threading poloidal magnetic field that can be established by the accretion flow . in this paper",
    ", we have argued that the plunge region of the black hole accretion disk has an important role to play in enhancing the horizon - threading field well above the modest levels suggested by previous works .",
    "we support this hypothesis by constructing a toy - model ( that is non - relativistic , assumes axisymmetry , and treats the fields away from the disk plane as potential ) with which we can follow the dragging of an external magnetic field by the disk and its subsequent trapping by the plunge region .",
    "our toy model suggests that the bz effect can be enhanced above the canonical estimates of ga97 by a factor of @xmath163 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath164 is the effective magnetic prandtl number of the disk and @xmath165 . even in cases where the effective magnetic diffusivity is small due to the mhd turbulence ( i.e. , @xmath166 )",
    ", the bz effect can be enhanced by one order of magnitude ( or more ) above the ga97 value if the disk is geometrically - thick @xmath167 .",
    "the @xmath63-dependence of this effect has an appealing resonance with the empirical evidence from gbhbs which points to a close connection between the existence of powerful black hole jets and the inferred properties of the accretion disk .",
