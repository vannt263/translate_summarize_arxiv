    "the late time evolution of stars influenced by strong gravitational pull has been a largely anticipated field in astrophysics and gravitational theories .",
    "it facilitates in investigations of diverse characteristics of gravitating sources via various physical phenomenons .",
    "baade and zwicky ( 1934 ) proposed the inception of massive compact stellar objects , establishing the argument that supernova may result in a small and super dense star .",
    "this eventually came in to reality in 1967 , when bell and hewish ( longair 1994 , ghosh 2007 ) discovered pulsars that are highly magnetized and rotating neutron stars .",
    "so , in reality , we come across a fundamental revolutionary shift from normal stars to compact stars , with a wide range in the form of stars to neutron stars , quarks , dark stars , gravastars and finally black holes",
    ".    in our present work , we are more specifically interested in study of compact stars category .",
    "generally the homogeneity of the spherically symmetric matter configuration is emphasized while theoretical modeling of a compact star , satisfying the tolman oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation .",
    "ruderman ( 1972 ) was the first one to argue that the nuclear matter density becomes anisotropic at the core of compact object .",
    "analytic solutions of the field equations for various static spherically symmetric configurations for anisotropic compatible to interior of compact stellar modeling have been obtained in numerous works ( maurya and gupta 2012,2013 2014 , maharaj et al.2014 , pant et al .",
    "2014a , 2014b ) .",
    "the pressure inside the fluid sphere disintegrates in two parts , namely radial and tangential pressure .",
    "it has been investigated that anisotropy gave rise to the repulsive force that assists to construct the compact objects . in this context , it is established in ( kamal et al.2012 ) that the krori and barua ( henceforth kb)(1975 ) metric provides an effective and realistic approach in modeling of compact stars .",
    "the numerical simulations can be taken into account to explore the characteristics of compact stars from integrated tov equations , if equation of state ( eos ) is known .",
    "rahaman et al .",
    "( 2012 ) extended the kb models by using the chaplygin gas eos and discussed their physical features .",
    "mak and harko ( 2004 ) established standard models of spherically symmetric compact stars via exact solution of the field equations .",
    "they determined the impressions of physical parameters such as energy density , tangential and radial pressure , concluding that these parameters remain finite and positive inside the stars .",
    "the anisotropic exact models for compact objects with a barotropic eos are discussed in ( 2006 ) .",

    "the issue of accelerated expansion of the universe can be explained by taking into account the modified theories of gravity such as @xmath0 gravity ( harko et al.2011 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 gravity provides an alternative way to explain the current cosmic acceleration with no need of introducing either the existence of extra spatial dimension or an exotic component of dark energy .",
    "harko et al.(2011 ) generalized @xmath7 gravity by introducing an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 and the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath2 may be introduced by exotic imperfect fluids or quantum effects ( conformal anomaly ) . as a result of coupling between matter and geometry , motion of test particles is nongeodesic and an extra acceleration is always present . in @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "cosmic acceleration may result not only due to geometrical contribution to the total cosmic energy density but it also depends on matter contents .",
    "soon after the origination of @xmath0 gravity , its cosmological and thermodynamic implications including the energy conditions and dynamical analysis were extensively discussed ( shabani and farhoudi 2014 , harko and lobo 2010 , harko 2010 , azizi 2013 , sharif and zubair 2012a , 2012b , 2013 , jamil et al .",

    "we have analyzed above mentioned @xmath6 model with @xmath15 , @xmath16 being a positive scalar . in our discussion , we have considered the model @xmath17 which does not imply the direct non - minimal gravitational coupling between scalar curvature @xmath1 and trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 in the lagrangian level .",
    "but there may be coupling between matter and geometry which becomes apparent in the study of thermodynamics ( sharif and zubair 2012a ) .",
    "the @xmath18 can be considered as matter correction term to @xmath7 gravity and in this particular study we choose @xmath19 .",
    "the main reason behind the difference on cosmology in ordinary @xmath7 gravity and in the above @xmath0 model is the non - trivial coupling between matter and geometry . in our previous work ( sharif and zubair 2012b )",
    ", we have reconstructed some explicit models of this @xmath0 gravity for anisotropic universe and explored the phantom era of dark energy .",
    "we have investigated that only for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the energy density of all the considered models remains positive and energy conditions are only valid for these values of @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",

    "<S> this paper constitutes the investigations regarding possible formation of compact stars in @xmath0 theory of gravity , where @xmath1 is ricci scalar and @xmath2 is trace of energy momentum tensor . in this connection , we use analytic solution of krori and barua metric ( krori and barua 1975 ) to spherically symmetric anisotropic star in context of @xmath0 gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the masses and radii of compact stars models namely model @xmath3 , model@xmath4 and model @xmath5 are employed to incorporate with unknown constants in krori and barua metric . </S>",
    "<S> the physical features such as regularity at center , anisotropy measure , casuality and well - behaved condition of above mentioned class of compact starts are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have also discussed energy conditions , stability and surface redshift in @xmath0 gravity .    </S>",
