    "recent progress in quantum dynamics has created a separate research field named _ open systems dynamics _",
    "@xcite ; its more mathematical aspects are presented in @xcite .    the contemporary focus on information measures has led to the introduction of a multitude of generalized entropies @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the various expressions have different properties and different uses . in our earlier work",
    ", we have attempted to describe the evolution of a general dynamical system by constructing a state functional displaying the direction of time by monotonically changing .",
    "this may then be regarded as a generalized entropy or , alternatively , as a lyapunov function .    in general , the time evolution equation of a physical system",
    "is of the first order and generated by a linear operator on the object defining the state of the system . for convenience ,",
    "the generator is here taken to be time independent , which restricts the applicability of our approach .",
    "the time step is taken to depend only on the state at the present time .",
    "this is usually called a _",
    "markovian evolution _ in physics . within these restrictions",
    "we have been able to develop a rather detailed theory for the general case .    in @xcite",
    "the solution was presented for a restricted class of evolution equations . in the case of a driven two - level system with decay ,",
    "the solution was presented in @xcite . as the cases discussed that far assumed no degeneracy , this was treated in @xcite .",
    "the case of a thermal reservoir was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the method introduced by us displays a monotonically evolving quantity .",
    "this serves to define a forward direction of time . in our paper @xcite",
    ", we derive the proper time - inversed behavior of  irreversible time evolution .",
    "the related minimum property of entropy production is discussed in @xcite .    in this paper , we want to apply the theory to a case not usually addressed by the formal evolution theory .",
    "we consider the case where the physics takes place in a state space pumped by externally induced means .",
    "the population in the space considered is thus increasing with time , but this is counteracted by decay channels out of it .",
    "this system is not of the canonical lindblad form @xcite , but it retains the physical interpretation by letting the density matrix elements denote the density of active particles instead of the customary probabilities . in laser physics and nonlinear spectroscopy",
    "this system has frequently been taken to model the physical situation investigated @xcite .",
    "as most experimental laser physics is still described by equations of this class , we regard it to be important to relate such equations to the more recent approach developed by us .    in sec .",
    "2 , we introduce the concept of a pumped system and its quantum mechanical description  by a linear master equation . in sec .",
    "3 we discuss the physical situation as it differs from a genuine lindblad case .",
    "finally we apply the theory introduced earlier to this case , and extract its characterization of the direction of time .",
    "the theory is then , in sec . 4 , illustrated by  applying it to the case of a pumped decaying two - level system .",
    "this model has played a central role in both laser spectroscopy and quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the formalism , however , also applies to markovian rate equations @xcite .",
    "finally the conclusions from the treatment are discussed in sec .",
    "the terminology of quantal state evolution assigns the term _ open system _ to any quantum system in contact with an environment . ordinarily the system is probabilistically closed ,",
    "i.e. we assume that the density matrix of the system retains the probability interpretation and is normalized .",
    "consequently all probability exchange between the states , reversible as well as dissipative , occurs between levels in the system .",
    "the general memory - less expression for such evolution is given by the lindblad form of the generating equation .",
    "there is , however , a class of time evolution equations that do not conform to this model .",
    "there  is a flow of probability through the system ; the states are pumped by some technical method and the influx of probability is compensated by states decaying to unobserved lower levels .",
    "such models are termed _ pumped systems _",
    "_ naturally the state space could be enlargened so that all pumping and decay mechanisms are included in the dynamics of the evolution .",
    "it is , of course , always possible to consider a space large enough to eliminate the need for a phenomenological master equation , but it is not always an expedient or even a practical possibility",
    ".    the time evolution equation will now hold several different pieces :    1 .",
    "the decays inside and out of the system are described by a relaxation operator @xmath0 , which we assume to be linear and memoryless .",
    "the time derivative of the density matrix in the absence of pumping and with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hamilton operator , would be @xmath3 2 .",
    "the pumping is described by a random process which at time @xmath4 introduces a system in the state@xmath5where @xmath6 is an arbitrary basis on the state space of the system under consideration . at a later time",
    "this will , in the absence of relaxation , evolve to the state@xmath7we now form an ensemble accumulated by all systems introduced at times @xmath8 this is described by the state@xmath9where @xmath10 is the probability of introducing a system in state @xmath11 into the ensemble at time @xmath12 this is assumed to be normalized over the states introduced:@xmath13the contribution from ( [ e3 ] ) to the time evolution is given by two terms,@xmath14 p_{\\psi } ( t_{0})dt_{0}.% \\end{array } \\label{e4}\\]]we now introduce the density operator averaged over the pumped states in ( [ e1 ] ) by setting@xmath15we may then write the averaged time evolution as@xmath16where the inhomogeneous term is given by@xmath17because the hamiltonian is taken to be the same for all systems pumped into the ensemble , we let the state coefficients satisfy the ordinary schrdinger equation in the form@xmath18where @xmath2 is the generator of the unitary time evolution inside the system . using this in ( [ e4 ] ) we obtain@xmath19 \\right ) _ { nm } ,   \\label{e6}\\]]where we have introduced the ensemble density matrix from ( [ e3b ] ) .",

    "the lindblad form falls under this more general class if we set @xmath21 if this is not the case , then the relaxation term @xmath22 can not be of the lindblad form , which on its own would ensure conservation of the probability .",

    "( 12 ) does not manifestly generate completly positive time evolution .",
    "however , properly used , it does not violate the physical interpretation of the density matrix .",
    "the pumping in eq .",
    "( 9 ) is of the form of a density matrix and thus can not cause any troubles .",
    "the damping operator ( 1 ) has to be introduced such that no abnormal results emerge .",
    "this implies inequalities between the decay constants , but these are no different from the corresponding relations encountered in markovian rate processes , ref .",
    "the hamiltonian evolution , naturally , induces only physically acceptable changes .",
    "the equation ( [ e7 ] ) may be written in a notation generalizing the lindblad case as@xmath25 in agreement with the concept of pumping a state , it follows that@xmath26this term can only add to the population of the state .",
    "the pumping mechanism is usually incoherent , and @xmath23 is not expected to have any non - diagonal contributions , because of the ensemble average .",
    "conservation of probability requires that the steady state , if it exists , satifies @xmath27the operator @xmath0 is thus essentially a negative operator .",
    "if no pumping occurs , @xmath28 there are two possibilities :    * after an infinite time , all population decays out of the system and the only steady state is the one with all populations vanishing , @xmath29 in this situation , the relation@xmath30has got no nonvanishing solutions ; all eigenvalues of @xmath31 are nonzero .",
    "* there is a part of @xmath31 which allows for a steady state with nonvanishing density matrix@xmath32this concerns a part of the state space which has no decay channel out of it , and population ending up here will remain trapped .",
    "thus no part of the pumped population can go into this subspace , because then probability would accumulate here without limit .",
    "it thus describes a part of the state space which is totally decoupled from the rest of the system : no coherent transfer nor any irreversible decay can couple this to the rest .",
    "it is consequently a system which can be treated by the ordinary theory ; all its population derives from its initial state and no pumping will affect it .",
    "in the subsequent discussion we omit this possibility .    the steady state solution of ( [ e8 ] )",
    "becomes@xmath33according to what is said above , the operator @xmath31 has got no zero eigenvalues , and the expression ( [ e13 ] ) will exist in all physically acceptable situations .",

    ".    with this notation we may write ( [ e8 ] ) as@xmath40with the notation@xmath41this allows us to write@xmath42which relates the present case to our earlier theory .",
