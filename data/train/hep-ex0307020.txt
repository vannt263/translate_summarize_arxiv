    "decays of the type @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents one or more light mesons , which can be mediated by both these transitions are thus a natural environment in which to attempt to measure @xmath0 .",
    "these modes are typically theoretically clean , as only tree diagrams are involved ; furthermore , they tend to have reasonably large branching fractions .",
    "however , the modes with the largest decay rates also tend to have the @xmath6 amplitude highly suppressed relative to the @xmath7 transition , making observation of the interference effects difficult .",
    "in addition , the experimental efficiency to reconstruct the @xmath2 meson reduces the yield of events .",
    "the challenge , both experimental and theoretical , is to find approaches which obviate these obstacles .    in what follows , the magnitude of the ratio of the @xmath6 ( suppressed ) to @xmath7 ( favoured ) amplitudes will be denoted as @xmath10 , whilst the relative strong phase will be denoted as @xmath11 . averaging over charge conjugate states",
    "is implied for branching fractions ( denoted by @xmath12 ) ; in other places the meaning should be clear from the context .",
    "of methods of this type , one of the first to appear in the literature was proposed by gronau , london and wyler ( glw ) @xcite .",
    "most methods to extract @xmath0 from @xmath13 decays can be considered as variants of this technique .",

    "furthermore , in order to extract the value of @xmath0 , either or both of @xmath22 and @xmath21 must be known .",
    "one might hope to measure @xmath22 from the ratio of branching fractions , @xmath23 , where the @xmath16/@xmath17 are reconstructed in flavour specific final states .",
    "ideally , semi - leptonic @xmath2 decays could be used for such a measurement .",
    "unfortunately , enormous backgrounds would have to be overcome in such an analysis , which to date have made this approach unfeasible .",
    "alternatively , hadronic decays of the type @xmath24 could be used to tag the flavour of the @xmath2 . however , doubly cabibbo - suppressed decays of the type @xmath25 have to be taken into account .",
    "since the products of amplitudes @xmath26 and @xmath27 are predicted to be similar in magnitude , the doubly cabibbo - suppressed @xmath2 decays preclude this approach .    nonetheless , there is sufficient information to extract @xmath0 , if the ratios of branching fractions to @xmath18 eigenstates and to quasi - flavour specific ( favoured ) states are included  @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to normalize each of these branching fractions to the @xmath28 rates ( highly suppressed contributions from @xmath29 can be neglected ) . in this way",
    "some systematic effects can be removed , and additionally the branching fraction ratios @xmath30 can be used to test the factorization hypothesis . defining the double ratios",
    "@xmath31 as @xmath32 it is again a matter of mere trigonometry to derive @xmath33    since @xmath34 , it can be seen that there are three independent measurements and three unknowns @xmath35 and hence there is enough information to extract @xmath0 .",
    "an eight - fold discrete ambiguity remains , however  @xcite .",
    "a remaining problem with this technique is that the size of the @xmath18 violating observable depends on the size of @xmath22 . as the @xmath7 transition is colour - allowed whilst the @xmath6 transition is colour - suppressed , early predictions for this value were @xmath36 . since the observation of larger than expected colour - suppressed decay amplitudes  @xcite , these predictions have been revised upwards , and",
    "an optimistic estimate is now @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "note that the formalism above has neglected possible effects from @xmath18 violation and mixing in the @xmath2 sector .",
    "a more thorough treatment can take such effects into account  @xcite .",

    "it is clear that substantially larger data sets will be required in order to measure @xmath0 .",
    "note that a number of similar decay modes , which can be denoted generically as @xmath50 , can be used for essentially the same analysis .",
    "however , these tend to have smaller reconstruction efficiencies , and so smaller yields are obtained , increasing the statistical error in these modes .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    a recent extension to the above method involves considering the entire dalitz plot of @xmath51 decays  @xcite .",
    "non - resonant contributions can be produced by colour - allowed transitions of both @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of amplitudes @xmath52 is expected to be large , resulting in augmented interference effects .",
    "however , the @xmath53 dalitz plot is likely to be dominated by resonances , and the non - resonant contribution may be rather small .",
    "the expected resonant structures include @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the first two have the @xmath6 transition colour - suppressed , exactly as before ; the latter is a pure @xmath6 transition .",
    "hence , if the dalitz plot is dominated by these resonances , it appears that there is no large improvement over the quasi - two body analysis , although interference between @xmath57 and @xmath58 may help to resolve ambiguities .",
    "if , however , there is a large non - resonant component , or at least that there is some reasonably well - populated region of the dalitz plot with a large value of @xmath59 , this method will allow extraction of @xmath0 with only a single ambiguity .",
    "data analysis will reveal whether this condition is satisfied .",
    "one variation of the glw method , proposed by atwood , dunietz and soni ( ads )  @xcite , makes use of the doubly cabibbo - suppressed @xmath2 decays which prevented the measurement of @xmath22 .",
    "as previously noted , the contributions to @xmath60 from @xmath14 followed by @xmath25 , and from @xmath15 followed by @xmath61 are expected to be similar in size , and therefore the @xmath18 asymmetry may be @xmath62 . whilst additional information will be needed to extract the value of @xmath0 , a measurement of non - zero @xmath18 asymmetry in such a mode would be a clear signal of direct @xmath18 violation .",
    "unfortunately , these modes are rather rare , and to date none have been observed .",
    "however , it may be possible to increase statistics by using inclusive @xmath2 decays of the form @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    another alternative can be found by considering neutral @xmath1 decays .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath64 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath65 ( @xmath6 ) are both colour - suppressed , leading to a value of @xmath66 as large as @xmath67  @xcite . in the case that @xmath68 , the flavour of the kaon is tagged by its decay products .",
    "therefore , precise measurements of the rates and @xmath18 asymmetries for @xmath69 and of the rates for @xmath70 and @xmath71 will allow extraction of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "when the final state includes @xmath72 the contributions from @xmath73 and @xmath74 decays can not be disentangled without tagging the flavour of the decaying @xmath1 . in @xmath75 @xmath1 factories ,",
    "this is achieved by identifying the flavour of the other @xmath1 in the @xmath76 decay  @xcite , so dilution due to @xmath77 mixing has to be taken into account . an intriguing prospect in this case ,",
    "is to study the time - evolution of the system  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that all the final state particles originate from decays of secondary particles with have non - negligible lifetimes ( @xmath16 , @xmath78 ) , complicating the determination of the @xmath1 vertex position .    to    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d0k0 ] , belle have recently observed the decays @xmath79 and @xmath70 with branching fractions of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively@xcite , using a data sample of @xmath43 . significantly larger data samples will be required for analyses in which the @xmath16 is reconstructed in a @xmath18 eigenstate . however ,",
    "if the ratio @xmath10 is large , as expected , the observation of @xmath71 should soon be within the reach of the @xmath1-factories .",
    "recently , another possible method to extract @xmath0 from the interference between @xmath14 and @xmath15 has appeared in the literature  @xcite . here",
    "the @xmath2 is reconstructed in a multibody final state which can be reached via both @xmath16 and @xmath17 decays ; a typical example is @xmath82 . at each point in the phase space ( dalitz plot for @xmath82 ) with contributions from both @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the interference pattern will be different for @xmath83 and @xmath84 decays , due to the weak phase @xmath0 .",
    "the phase space can be analysed in either a model independent manner , in which case additional information will be required from charm factories ( @xmath85 ) , or with some model dependence introduced by using breit - wigner forms for the resonances which contribute to the final state of interest . in the model dependent method ,",
    "additional information about the variation of the strong phase results in only a single ambiguity .",
    "note that the structure of such multibody @xmath2 decays can be studied at @xmath1 factories using the large samples of @xmath2 mesons which are tagged by @xmath86 decays .",
    "indeed , cleo has performed a dalitz plot analysis of tagged @xmath2 mesons decaying to the @xmath82 final state  @xcite .",
    "their measurement of the relative phase of the doubly cabibbo - suppressed @xmath87 contribution provides encouragement that this may , in future , be a feasible method to measure @xmath0 .",
    "the discussion up to this point has centered around @xmath88 decays .",
    "however , in each case it is possible to replace the primary kaon with a pion , and the formalism remains unchanged .",
    "in general , the effect is that the favoured amplitude becomes more favoured , and the suppressed amplitude becomes more suppressed .",
    "consequently the overall rates increase , but the sizes of the @xmath18 violating effects decrease .",
    "hence these methods are generally not effective to measure @xmath0 ( see , however ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , decays of the type @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , deserve attention , as will be shown . in this case , the favoured ( @xmath7 , _ eg .",
    "_ @xmath91 ) and suppressed ( @xmath6 , _ eg . _ @xmath92 ) amplitudes contribute to different final states .",
    "however , since these are neutral @xmath1 decays , there are also contributions from @xmath93 mixing , and the interference between the suppressed amplitude and the mixing amplitude leads to @xmath18 violating observables  @xcite .    assuming @xmath94 conservation and negligible neutral @xmath1 meson lifetime difference ( @xmath95 ) , the generic time - dependent decay rate for a @xmath1 meson , which is tagged as @xmath73 at time @xmath96 , to a final state @xmath97 is given by  @xcite @xmath98 whilst that for a @xmath1 meson tagged as @xmath74 is given by @xmath99 here @xmath100 whilst @xmath101 . @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the lifetime and mixing parameter of the @xmath73 .",
    "similar equations can be written for the decay rates to the conjugate state @xmath104 .",
    "taking @xmath105 as an example of this class of decays , note only tree diagrams contribute and so @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "asserting @xmath108 , identifying @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and neglecting terms of @xmath112 , leads to @xmath113 where the substitution @xmath114 has been made .",
    "therefore , a time - dependent analysis of @xmath115 can yield measurements of @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "external information about the value of @xmath118 is required in order to extract @xmath119 .",
    "note that the presence of the strong phase @xmath120 hinders the measurement of @xmath121 , adding a fourfold ambiguity .",
    "ideally , a precise theoretical value for this quantity is desired . whilst this may be wishful thinking , there are some theoretical arguments that strong phases should be small in @xmath122 decays  @xcite .",
    "it is often said that since @xmath123 is measured with good accuracy  @xcite , a measurement of @xmath121 gives the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this statement is perhaps misleading , since a rather precise measurement of @xmath123 may not lead to a similarly accurate value of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "for example , a constraint of @xmath124 leads approximately to @xmath125 . as a corollary , a rather loose constraint ,",
    "say @xmath126 , may be able to exclude the standard model prediction for @xmath0 .",
    "it is preferable to think of measurements of @xmath121 as providing useful constraints on the unitarity triangle in their own right .      in the formalism above",
    ", terms of @xmath127 were neglected , with the consequence that @xmath118 could not be measured from the time - dependent @xmath128 distributions . since @xmath129 , it is clear that the effects of the terms of @xmath127 are indeed too small to be observable .",
    "( note that this is not necessarily the case for a time - dependent analysis of @xmath130  @xcite . ) since there is roughly 20% theoretical error on the value of @xmath118  @xcite , experimental input is desirable .",
    "the decay @xmath131 is mediated by the suppressed amplitude , and hence @xmath132 to a good approximation  @xcite . for the same reason ,",
    "its branching fraction is extremely small , and large data samples will be required to measure it ( although the current upper limit of @xmath133  @xcite could be dramatically improved with the existing data ) .",
    "an alternative approach uses the decay @xmath134 .",
    "this mode is cabibbo - enhanced relative to the suppressed amplitude of interest , and has recently been observed as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : babar_dspi ] and  [ fig : belle_dspi ] . is also shown ; this is only relevant here in that it suggests there may be sizeable contributions from @xmath135-exchange , annihilation or rescattering processes , which in turn can affect the extraction of @xmath118 . ]    to    to    since the reconstruction of @xmath134 involves the decay @xmath136 , the poor knowledge of the branching fraction of this decay is responsible for the limiting systematic error of @xmath137 .",
    "for this reason , both babar and belle quote the product of branching fractions @xmath138 : babar measure it to be @xmath139  @xcite whilst belle obtain @xmath140  @xcite .",
    "belle have recently announced a measurement of @xmath141  @xcite , obtained by comparing the yield of @xmath142 using a semi - inclusive method ( @xmath143 not reconstructed ) to that obtained reconstructing @xmath144 in the @xmath145 final state . combining this value with the world average  @xcite , averaging the above values for the product branching fraction , and inserting into the equation @xmath146 yields @xmath147 , where @xmath148 has been assumed .",
    "as will be discussed later , in the vector - vector final state @xmath149 the value of @xmath150 can in principle be extracted for each helicity state .",
    "it may be possible to identify the longitudinally polarized component as the equivalent value for @xmath151 .      since the decay @xmath115 is amongst",
    "the most abundant hadronic @xmath1 decays , it has been used in a number of analyses at the @xmath1 factories .",
    "babar , belle and cleo have all used this mode to measure the @xmath73 meson lifetime @xmath102 and the mixing parameter @xmath103 .",
    "the analysis procedures can be divided into two categories .",
    "the first is full reconstruction , where the @xmath2 is reconstructed in a hadronic final state  @xcite ; not only @xmath151 but any other similar mode @xmath152 can , of course , be reconstructed in this manner .",
    "this technique has the advantage of having very little background , but the efficiency to reconstruct the @xmath2 is rather low . to improve the efficiency , a technique called partial reconstruction can be employed . here",
    "the decay products of the @xmath2 are not reconstructed , but the topology of the prompt ( `` fast '' ) pion and that from @xmath86 decay ( `` slow '' ) allow separation of signal from background ; clearly this approach can only be used for decay modes including a @xmath153 particle .",
    "analyses which use partial reconstruction tend to suffer from large backgrounds .",
    "similar @xmath1 meson decays , such as @xmath154 , can mimic the signal distribution , and are often called `` peaking background '' .",
    "additionally , there is a potentially huge combinatorial background , which must somehow be controlled .",
    "one approach is to require the presence of a high momentum lepton in the event  @xcite ; this almost entirely removes background from continuum ( @xmath155 ) processes , and has the added benefit of cleanly tagging the flavour of the other @xmath1 , at the cost of sacrificing a large proportion of the signal yield .",
    "[ fig : belle_dstarpi ] shows the @xmath151 candidate events obtained by belle using this technique , in an analysis in which the mixing parameter is measured to be @xmath156  @xcite .    to    another",
    "is to try to separate signal from background from the topology of the final state particles which are not used in the reconstruction .",
    "depending on the precise selection , this approach may retain a larger signal yield , with the price inevitably being larger backgrounds and less clean tags .",
    "[ fig : babar_dstarpi ] shows the @xmath151 candidate events obtained by babar using this technique  @xcite , in an analysis in which the neutral @xmath1 meson lifetime is measured to be @xmath157 .    to    it should be noted that these techniques produce samples which are approximately independent .",
    "furthermore , each has different systematic effects .",
    "therefore , these techniques can be considered as complementary .    from eqs .",
    "[ eq : b0dsmpip]-[eq : b0bdsppim ] , it can be seen that non - zero @xmath121 results in a small @xmath158-like term in the time - evolution of the state .",
    "rewriting @xmath159 , it is apparent that a small shift in the measured vertex positions , from which @xmath160 is extracted , can mimic @xmath18 violation . at the asymmetric @xmath75 @xmath1 factories , a vertex shift of a few microns can have an effect of a similar magnitude as that expected of @xmath18 violation .",
    "an additional complication is that tagging information is often taken from hadronic @xmath1 decays with the same quark - level process as @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , these hadronic tags exhibit tag - side @xmath18 violation , which can be as large as that on the signal side  @xcite . in spite of these difficulties ,",
    "first results on @xmath121 are anticipated this summer .",
    "decays of the type @xmath161 , where @xmath162 represent vector mesons , have contributions from each of the three possible helicity states  @xcite . the interference between these amplitudes results in additional observables which are sensitive to @xmath18 violation  @xcite ; in particular in @xmath154 ( or @xmath163 ) decays",
    ", it may be possible to extract @xmath121 without prior knowledge of @xmath150 .",
    "in fact , since there are three helicity states , there are three values for @xmath150 and @xmath164 . taking into account the relative amplitudes and phases of these contributions , there are in total 11 parameters which can , in principle , be extracted from the time - dependent angular analysis of these decays .    a first step towards such an analysis is to measure the polarization of @xmath165 decays ;",
    "this has recently been done by cleo  @xcite .",
    "they measure the fraction of longitudinally polarized component @xmath166 for @xmath167 and @xmath168 for @xmath169 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cleo_dstarrho ] .",
    "to    whilst time - dependent angular analyses of @xmath170 decays , such as @xmath171 , are starting to appear  @xcite , until now a more popular approach has been to measure the @xmath18 content from the polarization  @xcite .",
    "it may be possible to take a similar approach for @xmath165 and @xmath163 decays .",
    "this would be extremely beneficial for analyses in which the final state is partially reconstructed , since these techniques tend to result in rather poor angular resolution .",
    "babar have used partial reconstruction to reconstruct both @xmath149",
    "@xcite and @xmath172  @xcite , obtaining impressive signal yields ( @xmath173 @xmath172 events from a data sample of @xmath174 ) but with large backgrounds",
    ". it will be highly challenging to extract @xmath121 from these samples .",
    "at the time of writing , whilst a large number of methods to measure @xmath0 have been proposed , there is no direct experimental input from @xmath175 decays to constrain its value .",
    "@xmath18 asymmetries in @xmath38 decays have been measured , but the experimental errors currently cover the entire range of possible standard model values .",
    "nevertheless , more experimental information will be forthcoming shortly .",
    "in particular , some of the below may be achieved by summer 2003 :    * study of the @xmath176 dalitz plot * evidence for ads - style suppressed @xmath2 decays in @xmath177 transitions ( _ eg .",
    "_ @xmath178 ) * evidence for @xmath71 * study of multibody @xmath2 decays in @xmath177 transitions ( _ eg .",
    "_ @xmath179 ) * measurement of @xmath121 in fully reconstructed @xmath180 decays , and in partially reconstructed @xmath115 decays        it may be pragmatic to take a more patient approach and consider what will be possible by the time the @xmath75 @xmath1 factories accumulate @xmath181 each . with such large data sets , each of the methods described above should be able to provide a useful constraint .",
    "provided that nature has not been unkind in her choice of strong phases , direct @xmath18 violation in @xmath1 decays will be established .",
    "furthermore , the experimental evidence itself will indicate which methods are the most promising to precisely measure @xmath0 and to limit possible ambiguities , which can also be achieved taking advantage of the redundancy of measurements .",
    "finally , in such a time scale , hadron colliders will be providing measurements of @xmath182 decays , which can be used in a number of ways to measure @xmath0 .",
