    "they have shown that deutschian  closed timelike curves ( d - ctcs ) can help solve np - complete problems @xcite , that a d - ctc - assisted classical or quantum computer has computational power equivalent to that of pspace @xcite , that a d - ctc - assisted quantum computer can perfectly distinguish an arbitrary set of non - orthogonal states @xcite , that evolutions of chronology - respecting qubits can be a discontinuous function of the initial state @xcite , and that it is not possible to purify mixed states of qubits that traverse a d - ctc while still being consistent with interactions with chronology - respecting qubits  @xcite .",
    "the result of brun _",
    "et al_.  @xcite concerning state distinguishability is perhaps the most striking for any firm believers in unitarity , considering that a d - ctc - assisted quantum computer can violate both the uncertainty principle and the holevo bound  @xcite .",

    "et al_.  on d - ctc - assisted computation and distinguishability , respectively .",
    "they showed that the circuits of aaronson _",

    "the assumption of the model is that this evolution is mathematically equivalent to combining the state @xmath6 with a maximally entangled bell state @xmath7 where@xmath8 there is then a unitary interaction @xmath9  between the cr qubit and half of the entangled state .",
    "the final step is to project the two systems of the entangled state onto the state @xmath7 , renormalize the state , and trace out the last two systems .",
    "the renormalization induces a nonlinearity in the evolution .",
    "this approach is the same as the controversial final state projection  method from the theory of black hole evaporation  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : pctc - operation ]  depicts the operation of a p - ctc .    as pointed out by lloyd _",
    "et al_.  @xcite ,  the action of a unitary @xmath10  on a joint system consisting of a chronology - respecting pure state @xmath11 and a ctc  system@xmath12 is as follows ( before renormalization):@xmath13 implying the following evolution for a mixed state @xmath14 ( before renormalization):@xmath15 where the fourth equality follows from the above development for pure states .",
    "thus , the induced map on the chronology - respecting state is as follows ( after renormalization):@xmath16 where@xmath17 there is always the possibility that the operator @xmath18 is equivalent to the null operator , in which case lloyd _",
    "et al_.  suggest that the evolution does not happen  @xcite .",
    "this result is perhaps strange , suggesting that somehow the system interacting with the p - ctc  is annihilated .",
    "an explanation for what could happen resorts to potential imperfections in the unitary interaction .",
    "there is only a paradox for the evolution if the overlap of the ctc qubit with the final projected state @xmath19  is identically zero . in practice",
    ", evolutions do not occur with arbitrary precision , so that the p - ctc - assisted circuit magnifies errors dramatically , and unlikely influences outside the system of interest could intervene before the circuit can create a paradox .",

    "we adopt the nomenclature `` postselection with certainty '' in order to make this point clear . ]",
    "p - ctcs allow us to postselect with certainty the outcomes of a generalized measurement  @xcite .",
    "suppose the generalized measurement consists of measurement operators @xmath20 .",
    "suppose that we would like to postselect the measurement in such a way so that outcome 0 definitely occurs .",
    "we can perform the generalized measurement by appending an ancilla of dimension at least @xmath21 , in state @xmath2 , to the system , which we assume to be in a state @xmath22 .",
    "the initial state is thus @xmath23 .",
    "we then perform a unitary @xmath24 that has the following effect:@xmath25 ( this is the standard construction for a generalized measurement  @xcite . )",
    "now we do a second unitary @xmath26 , from the ancilla to the p - ctc qubit .",
    "this unitary is as follows:@xmath27 where the third operator in the tensor product acts on the p - ctc qubit .",
    "this construction makes every outcome except @xmath28 paradoxical , and measuring the ancilla in the standard basis postselects so that the resulting state is@xmath29 we can postselect on any subset of the measurement outcomes by varying the projectors in @xmath26 . for example , we can postselect by accepting any measurement outcome except @xmath28 . to do this",
    ", we would use the following unitary as the last one:@xmath30    there is an important difference between d - ctcs and p - ctcs that follows straightforwardly from their definitions .",
    "recall that deutsch s self - consistency condition requires that the density matrix of the d - ctc system after an interaction be equal to the density matrix before the interaction @xcite . in this way , deutsch designed d - ctcs explicitly to replicate exactly the predictions of standard quantum mechanics in the absence of ctcs .",
    "that is , before a ctc comes into existence , or after it ends , quantum mechanics behaves exactly as usual .",
    "p - ctcs , by contrast , act in a way equivalent to `` postselection with certainty , '' and they specifically rule out evolutions that lead to a paradox .",
    "this implies that the probabilities of measurement outcomes can be altered _ even in the absence of ctcs _",
    ", if ctcs _ will _ come into existence in the future . in principle",
    "this means that the possibility of ctcs could be tested indirectly , by looking for deviations from standard quantum probabilities , a fact that was also pointed out by hartle in ref .",
    "needless to say , it is far from obvious how to do such a test in practice .",
    "the bizarre behavior of nonlinear quantum mechanics would seem to cast doubt that ctcs can exist in the real world .",
    "we offer a simple example to illustrate the idea in the previous paragraph .",
    "suppose we have systems @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath18 , where @xmath18 is a p - ctc qubit .",
    "we prepare @xmath31 and @xmath32 in a maximally entangled state @xmath33 and measure @xmath31 in the pauli @xmath34 basis .",
    "then we perform a cnot from qubit @xmath32 to qubit @xmath18 .",
    "this circuit leads to a paradox if the result of measuring @xmath31 is @xmath4 , so it must be @xmath2 ( equivalently , one can check that the transformation induced by the p - ctc  is @xmath35 ) .",
    "but now consider what happens if we move the preparation and measurement of @xmath36 before the p - ctc comes into existence .",
    "there are two possibilities :    1",
    ".   the usual rules of quantum mechanics apply , and the probabilities of @xmath2 and @xmath4 are equal .",
    "if the result is @xmath4 , we avoid a paradox by magnifying tiny deviations from the exact unitaries , or other external effects to prevent the cnot from happening .",
    "2 .   the certain postselection forces the measurement result on @xmath31 to be @xmath37 , even though the p - ctc does not exist yet .",
    "option 2 is perhaps more natural in this ideal noiseless setting , and it also matches the qualitative results found by hartle using path integrals  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the system @xmath31  does not have to interact directly with the ctc  in order for this effect to occur .",
    "we begin this section by discussing some simple examples , and we then prove a general theorem that states that a p - ctc - assisted circuit can perfectly distinguish an arbitrary set of linearly independent states and can not do so if the states are linearly dependent .",
    "this section ends with a discussion of how these circuits act on different ontological representations of a quantum state .",
    "our first circuit in figure  [ fig : b92 ] distinguishes @xmath0 from @xmath1 and can thus break the security of the bennett-92 protocol for quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "the circuit consists of a cascade of a swap gate followed by a controlled hadamard , where@xmath38 so that@xmath39 the first qubit upon which the unitary acts is the system qubit , and the second one is the ctc  qubit . after tracing over the ctc  system ( as prescribed in ( [ eq : pctc - transform ] ) ) , we get the following transformation@xmath40 this transformation then gives @xmath2 if we input @xmath1 and @xmath4 if we input @xmath4 ( after renormalization ) .",

    "the interpretation of the above result is bizarre :  the p - ctc - assisted circuit changes the original probabilities of the states in the mixture , in spite of the fact that the preparer generated these probabilities well before the p - ctc  even came into existence .",
    "let us examine a third scenario .",
    "consider the following purification of the state in ( [ eq : labeled - mixture]):@xmath103 suppose that alice sends the @xmath31 system through the p - ctc - assisted circuit .",

    "though , this state is a purification of the state in ( [ eq : strange - state ] ) , so that the resulting state is the same as in ( [ eq : strange - state ] ) if we discard the system @xmath108 .    what should we make of these differing results ? in standard quantum mechanics , there are three concepts that are indistinguishable from each other :    1 .",
    "an ensemble @xmath109 of pure states ( classical ignorance ) ; 2 .",
    "an entangled state @xmath110 where subsystem @xmath32 is assumed to be inaccessible ; 3 .   a density matrix @xmath6 .",
    "the first is what despagnat called a proper mixture ,  and the second is what he called an improper mixture  @xcite .",
    "the density matrix is a mathematical object introduced to summarize the observable consequences of either of the other two .",
    "one could imagine such a thing as a true density matrix  an intrinsically mixed state that does not represent either classical ignorance or entanglement  though it is not clear what such an object would mean , physically . however , some researchers suggest that density matrices , rather than pure states , should be the fundamental objects in quantum theory . for instance , mixed states arise naturally in deutsch s approach to ctcs  @xcite .",
    "these three different ontological representations of a quantum state are all indistinguishable in standard quantum mechanics because it is a linear theory . but in a nonlinear version of quantum mechanics",
    "( as we get using either d - ctcs or p - ctcs ) we have no reason to expect them to behave the same , and they do not .",

    ".  @xcite  levies against ref .",
    "et al_.  use labeled mixtures  to represent classical ensembles , which is not necessarily justifiable in nonlinear quantum mechanics .    so what should be done ?",
    "if the labeled mixture  represents classical ignorance about how the system was prepared , that implies that , in principle , information exists which would specify a pure state .",
    "one should therefore apply the calculation separately to each state @xmath94 in the ensemble , and then combine them in a new ensemble . if the output state is random ( e.g. , the result of a measurement ) , one gets the probabilities of the new ensemble using the bayes rule .",
    "this is the first approach in ( [ eq : individual - renormalize ] ) .",
    "if the mixture is really part of an entangled state , one should apply the calculation to the purification of the state and then trace out the inaccessible subsystem as in ( [ eq : purified - calculation ] ) .",
    "this procedure will , in general , give a different answer , as ( [ eq : purified - calculation ] ) demonstrates .    finally ,",
    "if there are such objects as true density matrices ,  one can calculate with them directly .",
    "this is what we do in ( [ eq : strange - state ] ) , and it gives the same answer as tracing out the reference system @xmath108  of the purified state in ( [ eq : purified - calculation ] ) .",
    "also , bennett _",
    "et al_.  assume that a labeled mixture of states is a true density matrix ,  and this assumption is what leads them to conclude that d - ctcs are impotent  in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in summary , the first ontological representation of a quantum state as a proper mixture leads to a dramatically different conclusion for p - ctc - assisted circuits than the second and third ontological representations ( which both lead to the same conclusion ) .",
    "we also note that it is the same with d - ctc - assisted circuits ( the first representation leads to differing conclusions than the second / third ) , but the states output by a d - ctc - assisted circuit are different from those output by a p - ctc - assisted one .",
    "lloyd _ et al_.  prove that the computational power of quantum computers and p - ctcs is equivalent to pp ( probabilistic polynomial time )  @xcite , whereas the computational power of deutsch s ctcs @xcite  is pspace  @xcite .",
    "the proof is simple  since we can simulate any postselected measurement with p - ctcs , and can simulate p - ctcs with postselected measurements , the two paradigms have equivalent computational power . since aaronson proved that quantum mechanics with postselection has computational power pp  @xcite , pctcs indeed have computational power equivalent to that of pp .",
    "pp is a rather powerful computational class , including ( for example ) all problems in np .",
