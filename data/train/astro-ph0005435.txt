    "cataclysmic variables ( cv ) are short period binary systems consisting of a white dwarf that accretes matter via roche - lobe overflow from a low - mass companion star . these objects exhibit a wide range of phenomenology including optical flickering in nova - like systems , dwarf nova eruptions which are thought to be caused by thermal instabilities in the accretion disks , and classical nova explosions which are thermonuclear runaways of the accreted matter on the white dwarf ( see , e.g. , warner 1995 ) .",
    "the range of observed phenomena depends on the mass transfer rate , the mass ratio of the stellar components , and the magnetic field strength of the accreting white dwarf .",
    "the orbital periods of the majority of cvs range from 8 hours down to about 78 minutes , but both longer and shorter period systems are known . in the former case ,",
    "the donor stars are typically somewhat evolved , while in the latter case , the donor stars are hydrogen exhausted . in this paper",
    "we focus on the gap that exists in the orbital period distribution of cvs in the range of @xmath27 hr ( see , e.g. , warner 1976 ; rappaport , verbunt , & joss 1983 , hereafter rvj ; spruit & ritter 1983 ; hameury , et al . 1988a ; warner 1995 ) .",
    "the overall evolution of cv binaries is thought to be fairly well understood .",
    "the widely accepted explanation for the period gap rests on a mechanism for extracting angular momentum from the binary orbit ( e.g. , via magnetic braking of the secondary ) for periods down to @xmath7 hours , followed by a relatively substantial decrease in the angular momentum loss rate .",
    "the donor star , which had been thermally `` bloated '' in response to the mass loss driven by the systemic angular momentum losses , is then able to relax inside of its roche lobe and mass transfer ceases . the donor star is then thought to reestablish roche - lobe contact by the time the orbital period has decreased to about 2 hr , after which mass transfer resumes . in this paper",
    "we critically examine this paradigm for the creation of the period gap . while most workers believe in the existence of the so - called  2 - 3 hr period gap \" , a few ( e.g. , wickramasinghe & wu 1994 ; verbunt 1997 , but see also warner 1995 ; wheatley 1995 ) have questioned its reality , especially when all types of cv are considered ; however , we adopt the view that the period gap is a real feature of the cv population as a whole and , as such , requires a theoretical explanation ( with observational tests ) within the context of their binary evolution . finally in this",
    "regard we note a suggestion by clemens et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that the period gap results from a `` kink '' in the radius - mass relation for main - sequence stars at a mass of about @xmath28 ( but see the rebuttal by kolb , king , & ritter 1998 ) .",
    "in  2 we describe the conventional picture of the evolution of a typical cv , including the period gap , and show some illustrative examples of binary evolution calculations for individual systems . in ",
    "3 we explore how the binary evolution alters the relations among mass , radius , and orbital period of the secondary star .",
    "specifically we discuss how the main - sequence radius - mass relationship must be modified to include the addition of a `` bloating factor '' that accounts for the changes caused by departures from thermal equilibrium of the mass - losing secondary star .",
    "we derive semi - analytic mass - period and radius - period relationships for cv secondaries . in ",
    "4 we describe our population synthesis and binary evolution codes , while in  5 we present results from our population synthesis study of cvs in which the binary parameters of the cvs at all phases of their evolution are explored . in  6",
    "we show how assumptions that the donor star has a main - sequence radius - mass relation can lead to large errors in the assignment of the constituent stellar masses , most notably within the orbital period range of 3 - 5 hr .",
    "this period range should encompass the maximum bloating exhibited by a cv secondary compared to a main - sequence star of the same mass .",
    "also in  6 we discuss some specific observational implications resulting from our theoretical work .",
    "in particular , a specific test for cvs just above the period gap which will enable us , in principle , to distinguish unambiguously among different possible explanations for the period gap is presented .",
    "finally , we present our summary and conclusions in  7 .",
    "in the conventional picture of cv evolution ( see , e.g. , faulkner 1971 ; paczyski & sienkiewicz 1981 ; rappaport , joss , & webbink 1982 , hereafter rjw ; rvj ; spruit & ritter 1983 ; hameury et al . 1988a ; kolb 1993 ) , the early phases are expected to be dominated by angular momentum losses due to magnetic braking via a magnetically constrained stellar wind from the donor star ( see , e.g. , verbunt & zwaan 1981 ; rvj ) . in these early phases , mass transfer rates",
    "are typically @xmath29 to @xmath30 , and orbital periods range from @xmath31 8  hr to @xmath31 3 hr , just at the upper edge of the period gap . at some point in the evolution , the secondary becomes completely convective ( at @xmath32 ) and , in the currently accepted view , magnetic braking is assumed to be greatly reduced .",
    "the near cessation of magnetic braking reduces the mass transfer rate , and allows the secondary to shrink toward its thermal equilibrium radius .",
    "this causes a period of detachment , during which @xmath17 drops to essentially zero , and which lasts until the roche lobe shrinks sufficiently to bring the secondary back into contact with it , at an orbital period of @xmath33 hr .",
    "this is the commonly accepted explanation for the observed period gap between 2 - 3 hrs in cvs ( rvj ; spruit & ritter 1983 ) .    when mass transfer recommences at @xmath1 @xmath31 2 hrs , it is then driven largely by gravitational radiation losses at rates of @xmath34 . as the orbit shrinks and the mass of the donor star decreases , the mass - loss timescale increases , but the thermal timescale , @xmath35 , increases much faster , due to its approximate @xmath36 dependence",
    "therefore , at some point the thermal timescale grows larger than the mass - transfer timescale .",
    "when this occurs , the donor star is unable to adjust to the mass loss on its thermal timescale , and it therefore starts to expand upon further mass loss , in accordance with its adiabatic response ; i.e. , @xmath37_{ad } < 0 $ ] . the orbital period at this point is typically @xmath38 min and the mass of the donor star is @xmath39 . from this point on",
    ", the mass of the donor star will continue to decrease ( but with longer and longer @xmath17 timescales ) , the orbital period will increase back toward periods approaching @xmath312 hr ( within a hubble time ) , and the interior of the donor star will become increasingly electron degenerate . a discussion of this later stage of cv evolution is presented by howell , rappaport , & politano 1997 ; hereafter hrp ) .    to make these evolutionary descriptions somewhat more quantitative ,",
    "we show in figure 1 the secular evolution of several model cvs under the influence of magnetic braking and gravitational radiation . the evolution code used to generate these results",
    "is a descendant of the one used by rvj , and is described in  4.2 along with recent improvements to the code .",
    "the two panels on the left side of fig .",
    "1 show the evolution with time of a cv binary with initial constituent masses of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath19 and @xmath42 are the masses of the donor star and white dwarf , respectively .",
    "other parameters used in the calculation are for our  standard model \" ( see table 1 for definitions ) .",
    "the top and bottom panels show the evolution with time of the mass transfer rate and orbital period , respectively , for an assumed donor star with solar composition .",
    "the calculations have been carried out to approximately the age of the galaxy .",
    "the evolutionary phases and features discussed above are present in fig . 1 , including the interval where mass transfer is driven by magnetic braking ( @xmath43 yr ) , the period gap ( @xmath44 yr ) , the interval where @xmath17 is driven by gravitational radiation losses ( @xmath45 yr ) , the period minimum at @xmath46 yr , the subsequent increase in @xmath1 back up to @xmath33 hrs , and the sharp falloff in @xmath17 after orbital period minimum .    on the right side of fig .",
    "1 the temporal evolution of four other illustrative model cv binaries are shown .",
    "the following discussion contains descriptions of the period gap which develops in these systems ; these are easier to visualize by looking also at fig .",
    "2 . the initial masses ( @xmath47 ) of these systems are ( 0.2 , 0.4 ) , ( 0.35 , 0.35 ) , ( 0.3 , 0.6 ) , and ( 0.65 , 0.7 ) , all in units of @xmath48 . for the system with initial masses ( 0.2 , 0.4 ) the binary comes into roche - lobe contact for the first time at an orbital period below the gap , i.e. , at @xmath49 hr ( solid curve in figs",
    ". 1 c and d ) .",
    "note the enhanced mass transfer rate at @xmath31 30 myr after roche - lobe contact is made .",
    "the subsequent evolution is not dissimilar to the one shown in the left panels . for the system with initial masses ( 0.35 , 0.35 )",
    ", the donor star commences mass transfer at a period of 3.3 hr , with magnetic braking still operative ( dotted curve in figs",
    ". 1 c and d ) . because the two masses are the same when the donor star first fills its roche lobe , the mass transfer is only marginally stable ( see the discussion in  4.2 below ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath17 is initially very high and the system is quickly driven out of thermal equilibrium , causing the orbit to expand .",
    "this system comes out of contact ( i.e. , enters the period gap ) at an orbital period of 3.5 hr .",
    "the system with initial masses ( 0.3 , 0.6 ) is an example of one that commences mass transfer _ in _ the period gap .",
    "lastly , the system with initial masses ( 0.65 , 0.7 ) is another example of a system which exhibits the ",
    "usual \" 2 - 3 hr period gap , but commences mass transfer at @xmath50 hr .    in figure 2 the same evolutions shown in fig .",
    "1 are again presented , but this time the binary parameters are displayed as a function of the evolving orbital period . as in fig .",
    "1 , the left panels are for initial masses ( @xmath51 ) of ( 0.9 , 1.1 ) , while the right panels are for initial masses of ( 0.2 , 0.4 ) , ( 0.35 , 0.35 ) , ( 0.3 , 0.6 ) , and ( 0.65 , 0.7 ) .",
    "the top , middle , and bottom panels show the evolution of @xmath17 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "as mentioned above , the period gap is more evident in fig .",
    "2 than it is in fig .",
    "1 . we note here several unique features associated with the evolution of individual cvs ; an understanding of these features will aid our interpretation of the results obtained for an entire population of evolving cv systems ( see  5 ) . for example , @xmath17 typically exhibits a sharp spike at the onset of mass transfer , ( see also rvj and hameury et al .",
    "1988b ) ; this behavior will appear in all of the two - dimensional  images \" we produce from the population synthesis calculations in  5 .",
    "the mass of the donor stays constant during its evolution through the period gap since there is no mass transfer taking place at that time - this is indicated by the horizontal lines in the middle panels .",
    "the abrupt shift in location between the @xmath13 track above the period gap and below the gap will be dramatically apparent in the population synthesis results , and will have important consequences that are discussed below .",
    "finally , the radius of the donor star decreases sharply after the system enters the period gap ; in fact , it is the shrinking of the donor inside of its roche lobe when the magnetic braking ceases that is the putative cause of the period gap .",
    "again , the abrupt shift between the @xmath12 track above and below the period gap will be very pronounced in the population synthesis results .",
    "a noteworthy feature of figures 1a , 1c , 2a , and 2d mentioned above is the sharp rise in @xmath17 whenever mass transfer has just commenced , including the first time that the donor star fills its roche lobe , and after the resumption of mass transfer below the period gap .",
    "this results from the fact that when a low - mass star ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) is in thermal equilibrium ( i.e. , the nuclear luminosity , @xmath55 , equals the bolometric luminosity , @xmath56 ) , the sudden onset of mass transfer forces the star to expand because its adiabatic index is negative ( discussed above ) .",
    "this expansion can cause a temporarily anomalously high rate of mass transfer , viz , the episodes of high @xmath17 seen in figures 1a , 1c , 2a , and 2d .",
    "however , as soon as the donor star expands , its core temperature drops slightly , and @xmath55 , which is a highly sensitive function of temperature , drops dramatically .",
    "this leads to a luminosity deficit wherein @xmath57 .",
    "the star can then lose a net amount of energy , shrink , and approach its new thermal equilibrium radius ( appropriate to its lower mass ) on a kelvin - helmholtz ( i.e. , thermal ) timescale . during the mass loss process , true thermal equilibrium",
    "is never reached , and the luminosity deficit attains a value which is adequate to allow the star to shrink continuously .",
    "the above discussion explains the transient episodes of higher transfer rates at the start of mass transfer epochs , and the  outlying \" lower probability cv states we shall encounter in  5 .",
    "it also explains the thermal  bloating \" of the donor star which is discussed in  3 , and which will play a key role in the observational test we propose in  6 .",
    "( for earlier discussions of some of these basic effects , see rjw and hameury et al . 1988a . )",
    "the five individual evolutions shown in figs . 1 and 2 serve to illustrate the range of interesting possibilities for cvs which commence mass transfer with different mass ratios .",
    "the population synthesis study described in  5 , explores these various possibilities in a more systematic and complete way .",
    "we start with the assumption that during mass transfer in a cv the roche lobe of the donor star is located within its atmosphere , i.e. , the donor star is  filling \" its roche lobe ( see howell et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we then take the roche - lobe radius of the secondary star to be given by the simple expression of kopal ( 1959 ) : @xmath58 this can be combined with kepler s 3rd law to yield the well - known relationship among the mass , radius , and orbital period of the donor star : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath1 are expressed in units of @xmath48 , @xmath61 , and hours , respectively .",
    "if we now assume that the radius of the donor star is some factor @xmath62 times the radius it would have if it were a normal main - sequence star , we can write @xmath63 where we approximate the radius - mass relation for stars on the lower main sequence ( i.e. , g to m stars ) by @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are constants , and we refer to @xmath62 as the  bloating factor \" . this bloating factor @xmath62 is simply a measure of how much larger the radius of a cv secondary is than that of a single , main - sequence star of the same mass due to the departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "we can now combine equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) to derive relations for the mass and radius of cv secondaries as a function of the binary orbital period .",
    "@xmath68 for the purposes of this exercise , we take @xmath65 = 0.85 and @xmath66 = 0.85 , which we find by fitting a power law to the main - sequence models of dorman , nelson , & chau ( 1989 ; hereafter dnc ) . with these values for the constants @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the above equations simplify to : @xmath69 @xmath70 where , again , @xmath19 and @xmath21 are in solar units and @xmath1 is in hours .",
    "the conclusions drawn from these expressions are somewhat counterintuitive in that , for a cv at a given orbital period , if the donor star is _ bloated _ , the proper radius and mass that should be inferred from the orbital period are _ smaller _ than the values that would be inferred if the star were on the main sequence ( see also beuermann et al",
    ". 1998 ) . in  6 we derive polynomial fits for @xmath71 and @xmath72 from our population synthesis study ; the analytic expressions given by equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) serve mainly to demonstrate how these quantities scale with the bloating factor @xmath62 .",
    "the individual binary evolution runs shown in figs .",
    "1 and 2 for several different combinations of initial constituent masses are instructive , but do not ( _ i _ ) adequately sample the full range of possible initial masses , nor ( _ ii _ ) provide us with the distributions of cv binary properties at the current epoch .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a population synthesis study of cvs which consists of two parts . in the first part",
    ", we utilize a monte carlo approach to select a large number ( @xmath9 ) of primordial binaries , and follow the evolution of these systems to see which ones undergo a common envelope phase . in such events ,",
    "the envelope of the giant star engulfs the secondary , leading to a spiral - in episode which leaves the secondary in a close orbit with a white dwarf ( i.e. , the core of the primary star ; see , e.g. , ( paczyski 1976 ; webbink 1979 ; see also  4.1 for details ) .",
    "primordial binaries which are too wide will not undergo any significant mass transfer and will not lead to the formation of cv systems - the evolution of such wide binaries is not followed in the present study .",
    "successful systems which emerge from the first part of our population synthesis caculations are those which do undergo a common envelope phase and yield a close binary consisting of a white dwarf and low mass ( @xmath73 ) companion .",
    "the second part of the population synthesis considers those white - dwarf main - sequence binaries for which systemic angular momentum losses , or a modest amount of evolution by the normal companion star , can initiate roche - lobe contact within a hubble time .",
    "each of these systems is then evolved in detail through the mass - transfer phase ( cv phase ) until the donor star has been reduced to a negligible mass ( typically 0.03 @xmath48 ) .",
    "a number of prior population synthesis studies of cataclysmic variables have been carried out . these include work by politano ( 1988 ; 1996 ) ; de kool ( 1992 ) ; kolb ( 1993 ) ; di stefano & rappaport ( 1994 , for cvs in globular clusters ) ; and hrp ( emphasizing systems which evolve beyond the orbital period minimum ) .",
    "the current study has several new features and advantages over the previous studies .",
    "first , we compute probability density functions in two parameters , e.g. , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "this way of studying and evaluating the results of population synthesis calculations has a distinct advantage over producing distributions of a single parameter .",
    "for example , we are able to quantitatively evaluate phases of the evolution that are short lived or represent unusual evolutionary states , ( e.g. , whenever roche - lobe contact has just been established or when the initial binary mass ratio is near unity ) .",
    "other examples include the ability to discern the spread in @xmath17 at a given orbital period , the distinction between systems with he and co white dwarfs , and the pronounced depression in secondary mass at a given orbital period ( for systems just above the period gap ) .",
    "a second advantage is that our code for evolving the donor stars was originally developed to evolve brown dwarfs of very low mass and to very old ages .",
    "the code has been well  calibrated \" against other more sophisticated ones that have been used for the purpose of evolving brown dwarfs ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "finally , our population synthesis code which is used to generate the zero - age cvs that are input to the binary evolution code provides an independent check on previous work , and tests the sensitivity of our conclusions to various uncertainties in the physics , initial conditions , and other input parameters .",
    "finally , we mention a possibly important limitation on the study we present here , which also applies to most other prior work in this area . we have considered only donor stars with @xmath76 , and do not allow for the chemical ( nuclear ) evolution the donor .",
    "the latter approximation is realistic if the donor star commences mass transfer within @xmath313@xmath7710@xmath78 years of the common envelope event , or if the donor has a mass of @xmath79 .",
    "these conditions apply to most of the systems that successfully evolve through the cv phase in our calculations .",
    "furthermore , we find that only @xmath31 5% of all the stable mass - transferring , zero - age cvs in our population synthesis study have secondaries which are older than 1/3 of their main - sequence lifetime prior to the start of mass transfer .",
    "theoretically , there should indeed be some cvs which evolve from donor stars that are initially more massive than @xmath80 , and they should be followed in future population synthesis studies . for the present study",
    ", we simply assume that such systems , with donors whose initial mass exceeds 1 @xmath81 , do not contribute substantially to the cv population and , above all , would not affect our conclusions concerning systems near the period gap .    in this",
    "regard , recent work by beuermann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) examines the properties of the secondary star in cvs in an effort to determine if they are indeed similar to normal main - sequence stars .",
    "they show that , in the spectral type-@xmath1 plane , the @xmath82 cvs with measured spectral types lie below the expected relation for main - sequence stars ( i.e. , they are cooler at a fixed value of @xmath1 ) . beuermann et al .",
    "conclude that for systems with @xmath83 hr this effect could result from mass loss ( see  5 ) , but that for longer orbital periods this effect suggests chemical evolution of the donor star .",
    "this is a potentially important finding for systems with orbital periods longer than we consider here , and could also possibly impact the shorter period systems as well .",
    "> from our population synthesis results , we find that @xmath84 of cvs could potentially form with progenitors whose mass is initially sufficiently high ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) that chemical evolution of the donor star might indeed be significant .",
    "systems with such donor stars are not followed in the present study .",
    "if , for some as yet unknown reason , the more massive donor stars have a greater efficiency for producing cvs than their lower - mass counterparts , then chemical evolution may indeed prove influential in the evolution of cvs .",
    "these possibilities should be examined in future population synthesis studies .",
    "the properties of the primordial binary systems are chosen via monte carlo techniques as follows .",
    "the primary mass is picked from eggleton s ( 2000 ) monte carlo representation of the miller & scalo ( 1979 ) imf , @xmath86^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is a uniformly distributed random number .",
    "this distribution flattens out toward lower masses , in contrast with a salpeter - type power - law imf ( 1955 ) .",
    "we considered primary stars whose mass is in the range of @xmath88 .",
    "next , the mass of the secondary , @xmath19 , is chosen from the probability distribution , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 ( abt & levy 1978 ; but also see halbwachs 1987 ) .",
    "this mass ratio distribution is , at best , poorly known empirically .",
    "our adopted distribution has the property that the mass of the secondary is correlated with the mass of the primary , but is not strongly peaked toward @xmath91 .",
    "we find that our results are not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath92 , unless an extreme is adopted such as the assumption that the two masses are to be chosen completely independently of one another ( see , e.g. , rappaport , di stefano , & smith 1994 ; hereafter rds - their table 2 and fig .",
    "secondary masses as small as @xmath93 are chosen ( we wanted to ensure that only stars with masses clearly above the minimum main - sequence mass are included ) . to choose an initial orbital period , a distribution that is uniform in log@xmath94 over the period range of @xmath95 day to @xmath96 years",
    "is used ( see , e.g. , abt & levy 1978 ; duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) .",
    "since we consider only circular orbits the adopted orbital period distribution more properly pertains to the tidally circularized orbits than to the initial orbits of the primordial binaries .",
    "after the masses and orbital period are chosen , the orbital separation is calculated using kepler s 3rd law .",
    "we utilize an analytic expression for the relation among the core mass , the radius , and the total mass of the primary to estimate the mass of the degenerate core , @xmath42 , when the primary fills its roche lobe .",
    "the expression we used for this purpose ( see rds ) was designed to reproduce the features of figure iii.2 of politano ( 1988 ) and figure 1 of de kool ( 1992 ) , except that the core - mass radius relation for stars with mass @xmath97 was renormalized to match the fitting formula of eggleton ( 2000 ; see eq .",
    "[ 4 ] of joss , rappaport , & lewis 1987 ) .",
    "mass loss via a stellar wind prior to the start of the first mass - transfer phase was computed via an analytic expression derived by m. politano ( 1999 , private communication ) . in practice",
    ", the inclusion of this wind mass loss does not significantly affect the results .    in order to select only systems which undergo a common envelope phase",
    "we require that the radius of the roche lobe of the primary be larger than the radius of a star of mass @xmath20 at the base of the giant branch ( see , e.g. , paczyski 1965 ; webbink 1979 , 1985 , 1992 , de kool 1992 , and references therein ) .",
    "this ensures that unstable mass transfer will occur on a timescale that is substantially shorter than a thermal time , and should lead to a common envelope phase .",
    "once mass transfer from the primary to the secondary commences , we assume that a common envelope phase occurs and compute the final spiral - in separation based on simple energetic considerations ( see , e.g. , taam , bodenheimer , & ostriker 1978 ; meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1979 ; livio & soker 1988 ; webbink 1992 ; rds ; taam & sandquist 1998 ) .",
    "the expression we use for determining @xmath98 , the final orbital separation after spiral - in , is given by : @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the core and envelope masses of the primary , @xmath102 is the radius of the primary , @xmath103 is the initial orbital separation , and @xmath104 is the energy efficiency factor for ejecting the envelope .",
    "we take @xmath104 to have a value of 1.0 in our standard model .",
    "the two terms in parentheses on the right hand side of equation ( 9 ) represent the binding energy of the envelope of the primary to itself and to its core .",
    "the dimensionless coefficients multiplying each term were computed for an assumed polytropic envelope structure with polytropic index @xmath105 ( rds ) .",
    "for other similar values of @xmath106 the ratio of @xmath107 between the two coefficients is roughly the same .",
    "we assume that the duration of the spiral - in is sufficiently short ( @xmath108 yr ; see above references ) that the mass of the secondary does not change significantly during the common envelope phase .",
    "after the spiral - in episode , the separation , the white dwarf mass , the secondary mass , and the corresponding roche - lobe radius of the secondary are known .",
    "if at the end of the common envelope phase the secondary would already be overfilling its roche lobe , then we eliminate the system .",
    "( in most cases , this circumstance would be expected to lead to a merger of the secondary star with the degenerate core of the primary , which presumably would result in the formation of a giant star . ) in practice , if the roche lobe is larger than @xmath109 , then neither magnetic braking nor gravitational radiation would bring the system into roche - lobe contact before the secondary would evolve past the base of the giant branch .",
    "we can also eliminate these systems since the ensuing mass transfer would either be dynamically unstable ( see , e.g. , paczyski 1967 ; kippenhahn , kohl , & weigert 1967 ; webbink 1979 , 1992 ) or lead to an even wider orbit ; either case would not produce a cv of the ordinary kind .",
    "we typically start with @xmath110 primordial binaries and end up with @xmath111 pre - cvs to evolve through the mass - transfer phase with the bipolytrope evolution code described in the next section .",
    "the computational time for this first portion of the calculations is negligibly short .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the evolutionary tracks of cv systems are calculated using a version of the code that was first developed by rvj ( see also rjw ) to explore the effects of the parameterized verbunt & zwaan ( 1981 ) magnetic braking law on the evolutionary properties of cataclysmic variables . according to their algorithm , the mass losing donor is approximated by a bipolytrope wherein the convective envelope is represented by an n=3/2 polytrope and the radiative core by an n=3 polytrope .",
    "one of the advantages of this code is that it allows for the rapid computation of a large number of evolutionary tracks and provides a more physically intuitive interpretation of the results .",
    "the original version of the code has been modified substantially to allow for improvements to the input physics , and to ensure that the conditions near the surface ( atmosphere ) are more physically realistic .",
    "a number of these changes have been discussed in previous papers .",
    "the most significant of these modifications and updates are described by nelson , rappaport , & joss ( 1986a , 1986b ; 1993 ) who used a single polytrope model to follow the evolution of fully convective low - mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "the results of the brown dwarf cooling evolutions and the calculation of zams models of low - mass stars are in excellent agreement with those calculated using more sophisticated techniques ( see , e.g. , dnc ; burrows et al . 1993 ; burrows et al . 1997 ; baraffe et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "specifically , coulombic corrections to the pressure equation of state were incorporated and an updated version of the alexander , johnson , & rypma ( 1983 ; alexander [ 1989 ] ) low - temperature , radiative ( surface ) opacities was used .",
    "the molecular hydrogen partition function was also calculated more accurately .",
    "most importantly , the specific entropy at the surface was matched directly to the specific entropy in the interior ; i.e. , at the interface between the radiative core and the convective envelope . model ( @xmath112 of the specific entropy ) , decreasing to zero for fully convective stars . ]",
    "in addition to these changes , the atmospheric pressure boundary condition was modified so as to approximate more closely the scaled solar t-@xmath113 ( krishna - swamy 1972 ) relation .",
    "the radiative surface opacities did not include the effects of grain formation .",
    "since grains can only form in the atmospheres of very low - temperature stars ( @xmath114 1500 k ) , this should affect mostly the evolution of those cvs that have evolved beyond the orbital period minimum .",
    "however , we have found that the evolution of cvs through and beyond the period minimum , is not particularly sensitive to this omission .",
    "the overall result of all of these changes is that the theoretical radius - mass relation for our zams models with masses @xmath115 is now in substantial agreement with other theoretical calculations as well as with observational studies of low - mass stars ( see dnc ) . for similar abundances of hydrogen and for stars of approximately solar metallicity",
    ", we find that the radii of our new models compared with other theoretical models ( and the dnc results ) typically agree to within an rms error of @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "deviations among the theoretical models are greatest for the higher mass stars due to uncertainties in the mixing length parameter and the treatment of inefficient ( superadiabatic ) convection . when observations of double stars are considered , we believe that our zams radii are accurate to within @xmath118 .",
    "our zams models become fully convective at a mass of @xmath119 .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the value given in rvj but agrees well with the dnc results ( as well as with newer generations of models ) .",
    "mass transfer in cvs is driven by angular momentum losses due to gravitational radiation ( landau & lifshitz , 1962 ) and other systemic angular momentum losses such as  magnetic braking \" .",
    "the magnetic braking law that we utilize is that of verbunt & zwaan ( 1981 ) and parameterized by rvj .",
    "the magnetic braking parameters were chosen so as to best reproduce the observed period gap . according to the parameterization described in rvj",
    ", we took @xmath120 and did _ not _ adjust the multiplicative constant ( defined here as @xmath121 ) used in the rvj prescription .",
    "we also  shut off \" magnetic braking when the radiative core had been reduced to less than 15% of the mass of the donor .",
    "magnetic braking is assumed to be greatly reduced as a result of the restructuring of the magnetic field of the donor star when it becomes nearly fully convective .",
    "this reduction in the angular momentum loss rate gives the donor an opportunity to shrink inside of its roche lobe on a thermal timescale .",
    "further angular momentum losses due to gravitational radiation cause mass transfer to recommence once the binary system is brought back into a state of semi - detachment ( see , e.g. , rvj ; spruit & ritter 1983 ; hameury et al .",
    "1988a for a more detailed explanation ) . as pointed out in several places in this work , the actual mechanism that produces the bloating of the donor , and the means by which mass transfer is interrupted , are not central to the conclusions drawn in this paper .",
    "what is important in this regard is that the bloating be sufficiently large as to produce the observed width of the period gap . for our standard evolutionary model",
    "the period gap covers the range of 2.1 @xmath122 2.85 hr . according to warner ( 1995 ) , this synthetic gap approximates the observed one very well .",
    "we assume that mass and orbital angular momentum _ are _ lost as a result of nova explosions on the surface of the white dwarf accretor . for our standard model we assumed that all of the mass that is accreted by the white dwarf is lost with the same specific angular momentum as the white dwarf itself ( see schenker , kolb & ritter 1992 ) .",
    "given the relatively low mass transfer rates , it is likely that the nova events are extremely hydrodynamic , and thus it is unlikely that any of the accreted mass actually contributes to increasing the mass of the white dwarf ( see , e.g. , prialnik & kovetz 1995 , starrfield 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "after a potential cataclysmic variable system has been generated with the population synthesis code , the two detached components are given the opportunity to come into contact , via magnetic braking , within the age of the galaxy ( minus the cv formation time ) .",
    "however , the initial mass transfer may actually be unstable , thereby leading to a common envelope phase ( and the ultimate demise of the binary system ) .",
    "as derived by rjw , the expression for the long - term mean mass transfer rate in a cv is given by @xmath123 = @xmath124 , where the numerator , @xmath125 , contains the drivers of mass transfer , e.g. , systemic angular momentum losses , and the thermal expansion / contraction of the donor star ( see eq . [ 33 ] in rvj ) .",
    "the denominator is given by @xmath126\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath127 ( note that this is the inverse of the definition used in rvj ) , @xmath128 is the fraction of the mass lost by the donor star that is ultimately retained by the white dwarf , @xmath129 is the specific angular momentum carried away by matter ejected from the binary system in units of the binary angular momentum per unit reduced mass , and @xmath130 is the adiabatic index of the donor star , i.e. , @xmath37_{ad}$ ] . for our standard model",
    "( see table 1 ) , we take @xmath131 ( i.e. , all the mass accreted by the white dwarf is eventually ejected in nova explosions . ] ) , and @xmath132 . with these definitions",
    ", the above equation reduces to @xmath133 as discussed by rjw , stable mass transfer requires @xmath134 and @xmath135 . as an example , consider donor stars with @xmath136 and @xmath130 = -1/3 . in this case , stability ( based on eq .",
    "[ 11 ] ) requires that @xmath137 .",
    "this allows for considerably larger values of @xmath19 than the more conventional limit for conservative transfer where @xmath138 is required for stable mass transfer ( with low - mass unevolved donors ) .",
    "thus , the mass ratios that appear in our population synthesis can often approach unity or exceed it .",
    "we define a birth rate function , @xmath139 , for the progenitor primordial binaries , where @xmath140 is the elapsed time between the formation of the galaxy and the birth of the primordial binary .",
    "if a binary is born at time @xmath140 , then an additional time @xmath141 must elapse before the primary evolves to the point where a common envelope phase may occur ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "we define this time ( @xmath142 ) to be the birth time of the incipient cv .",
    "the resultant zero - age cv is then evolved in the binary evolution code for a total time @xmath143 = ( @xmath144 - @xmath141 ) yr , which is the maximum time any cv that is descended from a similar primordial binary could evolve before the current epoch .",
    "( the binary evolution code starts with the white dwarf and companion star as they emerge from the common envelope , so the elapsed time , @xmath145 , includes the interval before the donor star fills its roche lobe . ) at each step in the evolution code , specified by time @xmath145 ( with respect to the first time step in the code ) , we sum in discrete binned arrays for various combinations of @xmath1 , @xmath52 , @xmath146 , @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , the following quantity , @xmath147 : @xmath148 in this expression , the argument of @xmath149 is the time that the primordial binary was born with respect to the formation of the galaxy , @xmath150 is the time interval for that particular step in the evolution run , and @xmath125 is the total number of systems that are selected to start the population synthesis run . for all of",
    "the population synthesis runs in this study , the @xmath149 was taken to be constant in time .",
    "even though we have adopted a constant stellar birth rate per unit time , the method we use for generating the cv population at the current epoch is completely general ( see also kolb 1993 ) .",
    "the net result of this procedure is that the sum of the @xmath147s at the end of the population synthesis run , in any particular bin , represents the number of cvs at the current epoch with that particular parameter value .",
    "the computed population of current - epoch cvs as generated by the above techniques is displayed as a sequence of color images in figures 3 through 7 . in figure 3",
    "we show the model cv population in the @xmath11 plane for our standard model ( cf . fig .",
    "the image is generated in such a way that the color reflects the logarithm of the number of current - epoch cvs at a particular location in the @xmath11 plane . in each of the images the color scale is located on the right side .",
    "the image in fig . 3",
    "is comprised of 100 pixels per hour interval in @xmath1 , and 100 pixels per decade in @xmath17 .",
    "the most noteworthy features in figure 3 include the distinct groups of systems located above and below the period gap .",
    "note the substantial difference in @xmath17 for systems above and below the period gap ; for the latter systems only gravitational radiation losses drive mass transfer . the minimum orbital period ( @xmath15165 min )",
    "is also clearly evident , as are systems that have evolved well past the minimum period back up to values of @xmath152 hr .",
    "it has been proposed that these latter systems may be related to the so - called toads (  tremendous outburst amplitude dwarf novae \" ; see , e.g. , howell et al .",
    "1995 , hrp ) . in the systems above the gap",
    ", there is a central band of evolutionary tracks ( blue and green ) where a typical cv is most likely to be found at a particular point in time during its evolution .",
    "one also notices very short lived episodes ( red and yellow ) of high mass transfer rates .",
    "these occur for individual systems as the donor star first fills its roche lobe and commences mass transfer , but before it can come into a quasi - steady state of mass transfer ( see discussion in  2 ) . the same type of behavior is seen ( green structure ) for systems that have come into contact for the first time below the period gap , i.e. , with initially very low - mass donor stars .",
    "the two main tracks ( purple ) evident in the systems below the period gap are for he ( lower ) and co ( upper ) white dwarfs , respectively .",
    "we also call attention to the small vertical ( blue ) feature at @xmath152 hr .",
    "this may be related to the statistically significant larger number of cvs with periods in the range of @xmath153 minutes ( first pointed out by hameury et al .",
    "finally , we note that there are systems found within the period gap , though fewer per period interval than for systems below the gap .",
    "systems found within the period gap are typically ones which had initial donor masses of @xmath310.22 - 0.34 m@xmath154 and commenced roche - lobe overflow at orbital periods in the range of @xmath312 - 3 hr ( see also fig . 2 and its associated discussion ) .",
    "further , in regard to the @xmath11 plane shown in figure 3 , we point out that for systems above the period gap , the width of the distribution in @xmath17 at any fixed value of @xmath1 is only about a factor of @xmath312 ( we define the  width \" as containing @xmath155 of the systems ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the _ observed _ spread in @xmath17 for cvs which is closer to an order of magnitude ( see , e.g. , patterson 1984 ; warner 1995 ) .",
    "one cause of this spread may be the inherent uncertainty in translating observed parameters into accurate estimates of @xmath156 .",
    "additionally , some of this discrepancy might be resolved by the inclusion of the effects of nova explosions in cvs which , on a quasi - regular basis , slightly increase ( or perhaps even decrease ) the orbital separation ( e.g. , by @xmath157 ) which is sufficient to change @xmath17 appreciably for some interval of time ( see , shara et al .",
    "1986 ; schenker et al . 1998 ; kolb et al .",
    "however , we note that schenker et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that , except for extreme model parameters , the occurrence of the nova explosions generally does not substantially affect the overall secular evolution of the cvs .",
    "therefore the main results and conclusions presented in this work should be robust even without the inclusion of _ orbital _ perturbations due to nova explosions ( we do , in fact , take into account the mass and angular momentum lost in such events ) .",
    "the population of current - epoch cvs in the @xmath158 plane for our standard model is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the shape traced out in this figure represents a statistical ensemble of the type of evolutions graphed in figs . 2c and 2f .",
    "the usual features of the  upper branch \" of systems above the period gap , systems in the  lower branch \" below the gap , and the minimum orbital period are all represented in this figure . again , as in fig .",
    "3 , we see that some systems are formed within the period gap .",
    "it is difficult from this image to judge quantitatively how many systems are in the gap , versus the density of points just below the gap .",
    "this is quantified later in this section ( see fig .",
    "note that an extrapolation of the  upper branch \" to shorter orbital periods would undershoot the  lower branch \" , on which the stars are close to thermal equilibrium . as discussed in  2 , this undershooting actually ( counterintuitively ) results from the thermal _ bloating _ of the donor star when it has a higher mass loss rate which is driven by magnetic braking .",
    "in particular , see equation ( 7 ) where we show that @xmath21 scales as @xmath159 , where @xmath62 is the bloating factor .",
    "the low - density features ( yellow ) just above the main tracks through the  upper branch \" are systems that have just come into roche - lobe contact for the first time and have not yet established a quasi - steady state of mass transfer .",
    "the blue - green  thumb \" feature just below the main track of the  upper branch \" near the top edge of the period gap , represents systems with he white dwarfs and donor stars of comparable mass that have just come into contact .",
    "their mass transfer rates are higher than normal for these orbital periods ; thus the bloating factors for these donor stars are significantly larger than for systems on the main track ( cf . fig .",
    "perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the effects of thermal bloating of the donor star can be seen in figure 5 which shows the population of current - epoch cvs in the @xmath160 plane for our standard model .",
    "the shape traced out in this figure represents a statistical ensemble of the type of evolutions graphed in figs .",
    "2b and 2e . all of the features that appear in the @xmath158 image ( fig .",
    "4 ) , also appear in this @xmath160 image , except in a more exaggerated form .",
    "this is a direct result of the simple scaling argument summarized in equation ( 6 ) in  2 , which indicates that the bloating effect on the masses just above the period gap scales as @xmath161 .",
    "a casual inspection of figure 5 shows that the masses of the donor stars in cvs with periods just above the period gap are fully @xmath162 lower than would be expected if their radius - mass relation followed that of main - sequence stars .",
    "it is this effect that we propose be used to discriminate between the currently held explanation for the period gap and alternate scenarios .",
    "we return to a quantitative discussion of this issue in the next section .",
    "lastly in regard to the color images of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 planes ( figs . 4 and 5 ) , we comment on the relatively large spreads in @xmath21 and @xmath19 for systems above the period gap in contrast with those below the gap . as we showed in equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , for a fixed value of the bloating parameter @xmath62 , both @xmath19 and @xmath21 are unique functions of the orbital period ( which would imply narrow tracks ) . for systems well above the period gap ,",
    "the kelvin timescale , @xmath35 , is shorter than the mass - loss timescale , @xmath163 , but , as the orbital period decreases and approaches the period gap , the two timescales become more comparable . thus , as discussed in  2 , the donor star must become ever more bloated so as to establish a luminosity deficit , which in turn enables the donor to contract inside its ever shrinking roche lobe .",
    "additionally , the adiabatic stellar index is changing from positive to negative , and this tends to make the star expand even further as it loses mass ( see also beuermann et al .",
    "these two effects lead to the bloating behavior that is seen in figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "the actual amount of bloating depends upon the absolute values of the two constituent masses as well as on the thermal history of the donor ; therefore , it is to be expected that @xmath62 may vary from one donor star to another . as a result",
    ", we not only see enhanced bloating as systems approach the period gap , but a relatively wider and wider spread in the values of @xmath19 and @xmath21 for these systems , especially for @xmath1 in the range of 3 - 5 hr . by contrast , for systems just below the period gap , @xmath164 increases abruptly - by about an order of magnitude - because the mass transfer is then driven only by gravitational radiation losses ( at least according to our model ) , and therefore the donor stars can remain much closer to thermal equilibrium .",
    "this allows the systems right below the gap to establish a nearly main - sequence radius - mass relation ( i.e. , @xmath165 ) , thereby leading to a relatively narrow set of evolution tracks .",
    "however , as the secondary s mass approaches the minimum main - sequence mass ( before the orbital period minimum ) , @xmath35 becomes very long ( due to a sharp decrease in the secondary s nuclear luminosity ) , thereby causing @xmath35 and @xmath164 to again become approximately equal .",
    "thus , the width of the tracks broadens somewhat near the orbital period minimum . for systems beyond the orbital period minimum ,",
    "the interiors become increasingly electron degenerate .",
    "this leads to a nearly unique mass - radius relationship @xmath166 which , in turn , leads to entirely different @xmath167 and @xmath168 relations than are given by equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "nonetheless , they are unique relations ( easily derivable from eqs . [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] ) which also lead to a very narrow set of tracks in figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "the distribution of expected mass ratios , @xmath18 , in cvs at the current epoch is shown as a function of orbital period in figure 6 . at any given orbital period",
    "the range of @xmath18 values is considerably broader than the distribution of values of @xmath21 or @xmath19 as can be seen by comparison with figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "the reason for this is straightforward .",
    "equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) indicate that , as long as the bloating factor @xmath62 depends largely on the orbital period of a cv , then both the radius and mass are nearly unique functions of the orbital period .",
    "thus , the much broader distribution of @xmath18 in fig .",
    "6 is due largely to the substantial range of masses that the white dwarf may have , which is much less constrained by the orbital period than is @xmath19 . for both the systems above and below the period gap , the upper set of tracks corresponds to he white dwarfs , while the lower tracks are for co white dwarfs .",
    "the period gap is especially conspicuous in this figure , especially for systems with co white dwarfs .",
    "note that some of the mass ratios extend up to values of unity and , in some cases , above unity .",
    "the stability of mass transfer in these systems was discussed in  4.2 [ see equation ( 11 ) ] .",
    "the evolution of our model population of cvs in the @xmath15 and luminosity@xmath169 planes is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the left panel displays the effective temperature , @xmath22 of the donor star , while the right panel has a superposition of the optical ( bolometric ) luminosity , @xmath56 and nuclear luminosity @xmath55 .",
    "where the two sets of luminosity tracks cross ( e.g. , near @xmath1 = 1 hr ) or overlap ( e.g. , to a minor extent between 3 and 6 hrs ) , the default is to display @xmath56 . with regard to the @xmath22 curves",
    ", we first note that the absolute temperature scale for our main sequence stars ( based on our bipolytrope code ) is somewhat shifted from that produced with more sophisticated codes , e.g. , our bipolytrope main - sequence models are @xmath31200 k higher than the dnc models over the mass range of @xmath170 .",
    "however , aside from this small quantitative difference we are confident that the overall qualitative trends and shapes of these tracks are highly indicative of the behavior and properties of the donor through its evolutionary history .",
    "note that for values of @xmath1 below the gap as well as above @xmath315 hr , the @xmath22 tracks are quite narrow , in analogy with the tracks in the @xmath13 and @xmath12 planes , since the donor stars are typically quite close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "by contrast , within the period range of 3 - 5 hr , @xmath22 of the donors is systematically lowered by up to 250 k compared with @xmath22 of main sequence stars at the same @xmath1 .",
    "this lower temperature amounts to a change to a later spectral type ( at a given @xmath1 ) of @xmath171 in decimal subclass .",
    "additionally , we can see from fig .",
    "7 that , over this same period range , the use of temperature ( or spectral type ) to determine the mass of the secondary star would require very precise measurements , since the expected @xmath15 distribution is relatively flat .",
    "we draw two conclusions from this figure : ( 1 ) an observationally produced @xmath15 or spectral type-@xmath1 relation for cvs should indeed yield a fairly simple shape ( especially when smoothed out by uncertainties in the measurements ) , and ( ii ) the use of @xmath22 or spectral type in the 3 - 5 hr period range will not yield reliable indications of the mass of the donor star .",
    "recently , smith & dhillon ( 1988 ) 90 min and @xmath172 brighter than @xmath3117th magnitude , thus smith & dhillon s conclusions about finding no evidence for post - period minimum systems or very low - mass brown dwarf - like secondaries can not be drawn from the sample they used . ]",
    "published results which took a critical look at the relation between orbital period , spectral type , and secondary mass based on the best observational data available in the literature .",
    "they presented a relatively smooth spectral type - orbital period relation but concluded that one can not reliably estimate @xmath19 in any given cv based solely on its spectral type .",
    "our theoretical results are quite consistent with their conclusion .",
    "the image in the right panel of figure 7 displays a superposition of the evolutionary tracks for @xmath56 and @xmath55 as functions of @xmath1 . for systems above the gap , the highest luminosity track corresponds to @xmath56 , while the two prominent lower ( green ) tracks are for @xmath55 and are related to the corresponding features in the @xmath13 image .",
    "these two lower luminosity tracks are for systems with co ( upper ) and he ( lower ) white dwarf accretors ( see the discussion of fig .",
    "the large luminosity deficit in the @xmath1 range of 3 - 5 hr , already discussed in  2 , shows up quite dramatically in this fig .",
    "the group of systems with the highest luminosity deficit ( with he white dwarf accretors ) has the largest values of @xmath17 and the donors are the most out of thermal equilibrium ( largest bloating factor ) . in spite of the relatively low values of @xmath55 in this period range ,",
    "the bolometric luminosity @xmath56 is depressed only modestly ( e.g. , by factors of @xmath173 2 ) over main - sequence stars at the same orbital period . for systems below the period gap ,",
    "both luminosities fall off dramatically , especially for donor masses below @xmath174 , where the donors are already below the hydrogen - burning main sequence , and are cooling toward their ultimate degenerate state . the higher track for all points below the period gap corresponds to @xmath56 , the lower one to @xmath55 . while it is formally true that the @xmath56 and @xmath55 tracks  cross \" at @xmath175 , the two luminosities are never equal in this part of the diagram ; they reach the crossing point at very different times .",
    "finally , with regard to the color image representations of cv populations in parameter space , we note that in figs . 3 through 7 , the color represents the logarithm of the numbers of systems expected at the current epoch . as can be seen in any of these figures ( but especially figs . 3 and 6 ) , the number of systems below the period gap outweighs the number above the period gap by a large margin ( by about 100:1 ; see the more quantitative discussion below ; see also de kool 1992 , kolb 1993 ) . however , due to observational selection effects , the systems with the shorter orbital periods , lower values of @xmath17 , and generally longer intervals between dwarf - nova outbursts , are more difficult to discover .",
    "the exact factors that go into the observational selection effects are complex , especially since some cvs are discovered via their dwarf - nova outbursts , others ( e.g. , longer period cvs ) by their blue colors or flickering behavior , and still others by their nova outbursts . some of these issues are discussed in rjw and kolb ( 1993 ) . for purposes of the present work we will indicate only qualitatively how the numbers of observationally known cvs",
    "might be expected to be distributed by orbital period .",
    "we adopt two crude detectability factors which scale simply as @xmath176 and as @xmath17 .",
    "the first of these is appropriate to steady - state accretion luminosities , that are proportional to @xmath17 in the optical bandpass , which give rise to a bolometrically flux - limited detectability proportional to @xmath176 ( analogous to the 3/2 slope of a log(n)-log(s ) curve for isotropically distributed sources ) . the other",
    "scaling , appropriate to the case where the flux in the optical bandpass is proportional to @xmath177 ( see lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ; rjw ; webbink et al .",
    "1987 ) , leads to a flux - limited detectability proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "other factors leading to the discovery of cvs , beyond the simple consideration of flux limited samples , in particular the detection of dwarf nova outbursts , would undoubtedly substantially modify the rudimentary dependences on @xmath17 that we use here for purposes of illustration .",
    "in figure 8 we redisplay fig . 3 , but this time rescaled by a factor of @xmath156 .",
    "it is clear from a casual inspection of fig . 8",
    "that the number of  detectable \" systems above the period gap is now at least as great as for those below the gap .",
    "the actual quantitative values for this simple scaling are presented below .",
    "we again caution , however , that either an @xmath176 or @xmath17 scaling is oversimplified .",
    "the color images of parameter space shown in figures 3  7 can be displayed in a somewhat more quantitative fashion by projecting the numbers of systems onto the various axes and plotting the results as simple histograms .",
    "for example , the data used to produce any of the images , can be projected onto the @xmath1 axis to yield the orbital period distribution .",
    "the results are shown in figure 9 .",
    "the solid histogram in fig .",
    "9a is the distribution of cvs at the current epoch in the entire galaxy for our standard model ( see table 1 )",
    ". the stellar birthrate function and imf in our standard model [ eq .",
    "( 8) ] are normalized in such a way that there are @xmath178 stars born in the galaxy per year with a mass @xmath179 , just above the threshold for producing a remnant white dwarf by the current epoch .",
    "thus , the  absolute values \" of the numbers plotted in fig .",
    "9 can be appropriately scaled up or down for either lower or higher assumed birthrates .    if the numbers of cv systems are scaled by the types of  observability factors \" discussed above , before the histogram is produced , the results are the dashed and dotted histograms superposed in figure 9a . as discussed above , in conjunction with fig .",
    "8 , this qualitatively helps to explain the relative numbers of cvs observed above the period gap compared with the number observed below ( see especially the dotted histogram ) .",
    "inspection of the compilation of cvs with known orbital periods given in warner ( 1995 ) reveals that our histogram shown in fig .",
    "9a with the @xmath17 scaling provides qualitative agreement with current observational results , especially considering the many observational selection effects that exist ( e.g. , magnitude - limited color surveys , large - amplitude but infrequent outbursts compared with semi - periodic lower amplitude outbursts , discovery in x - ray surveys , etc . ) .",
    "the distributions of orbital period shown in figure 9b are for systems that have not yet evolved to the minimum orbital period ( solid curve ) , and systems that have evolved beyond the period minimum ( dashed curve ) - no scaling in @xmath17 has been applied here .",
    "the distributions of white dwarf masses and donor masses at the current epoch are shown in figure 10 ( left and right panels respectively ) for four different ranges of orbital period .",
    "the he and co white dwarfs are easy to distinguish by mass . note that for systems with @xmath180 hr , which typically have donor stars with masses @xmath181 , there are few he white dwarfs , since the mass transfer would tend to be unstable .",
    "the distributions of donor star masses show a steady trend toward higher masses at the longer periods , as expected .",
    "this results qualitatively from the fact that the larger orbital periods require less dense , and therefore usually more massive , stars .",

    "the observational distribution for @xmath18 in short period ( @xmath183 hr ) cvs has recently been compiled ( mennickent et al .",
    "1999 ) , and is seen to show an approximate gaussian distribution with @xmath184 = 0.14 .",
    "however , observational selection effects allow few cvs with small @xmath18 to be discovered due to their intrinsic faintness .",
    "our results ( fig . 11 - top panel ) show that the actual distribution should not drop off at @xmath18 values lower then 0.14 , but rather should peak at values of @xmath18 = 0.05 - 0.1 , with an overall distribution that is clearly non - gaussian .",
    "discovery and observation of additional faint ( short period ) cvs are needed in order to confirm this theoretical prediction .",
    "the rapid rate of mass loss for donor stars in cvs just above the period gap should lead to significant thermal bloating of the donor .",
    "thus , in the conventional paradigm for the formation of the period gap , this mass loss rate is abruptly decreased at orbital periods near 3 hr and the donor star shrinks inside its roche lobe ( see  2 ) , leading to the cessation of mass transfer .",
    "specific choices of the parameters utilized in any such evolutionary model change the bloating factor quantitatively , but do not change the overall evolution qualitatively . to demonstrate this ,",
    "we show in figure 12 cvs at the current epoch in the @xmath160 plane for four different sets of model parameters ( see table 1 ) .",
    "panel ( a ) is for our standard model , while the other panels are for models where ( b ) the proportionality constant in the magnetic braking formula was reduced by a factor of 2 ( @xmath185 ) , ( c ) the specific angular momentum carried away by mass lost from the system in nova explosions is twice that of the white dwarf ( @xmath186 ) , and ( d ) all mass transferred to the white dwarf is ultimately retained by the white dwarf ( i.e. , @xmath187 ; in this somewhat artificial model , white dwarfs are allowed to exceed the chandrasekhar limit ) .",
    "we see from a study of figure 12 that the effects of thermal bloating on the mass of the donor stars in cvs for orbital periods just above the gap are qualitatively similar for all four models .",
    "the actual factors by which the masses are lower than would be inferred by making the assumption that the donor has a main - sequence mass - radius relation range from @xmath188 ; the exact range depends on which model parameters are chosen and whether one includes the cvs with he white dwarfs where the mass transfer can be only marginally stable . to quantify the effect of thermal bloating on mass determinations , we have carried out weighted least squares fits of polynomials to each of the  upper branches \" shown in fig",
    "the results are given in table 2 which also includes the evaluation of the polynomial fit at @xmath189 hr .",
    "as we can see from table 2 , the effect of thermal bloating on the inferred donor mass of cvs is quite significant , and potentially testable for any of these models .",
    "we note that , in general , the _ spread _ in values of @xmath19 , at a given @xmath1 , around the best - fit @xmath168 curve is substantially smaller than the mean deviation from an @xmath168 curve based on the assumption of a main - sequence mass - radius relation , especially in the crucial period range of 3 - 5 hr .",
    "a large part of this spread is due to the different values of the mass of the accretor , @xmath20 , with lower values of @xmath19 corresponding to the lower values of @xmath20 ( see also the discussion in  5 ) .",
    "however , we do not attempt here to produce fits of the more general form @xmath190 .",
    "such fits are not straightforward to construct since , among other things , there is the added complication of the existence of a minimum value for @xmath191 at any @xmath1 ( due to issues of mass - transfer stability ; see  4.2 ) . in any case , the main effect to be confirmed observationally concerns the substantially reduced values of @xmath19 just above the period gap ( 3 - 5 hr ) , compared to what would be expected if the donor stars followed a main - sequence mass - radius relation .",
    "if sufficient numbers of high quality mass determinations of the secondary stars can be made , and this basic effect is confirmed , then a secondary goal would be to look for a weak , but positive correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in figure 13",
    "we plot the polynomial fits that we made to the upper branches in the @xmath13 plane for the four different models . for comparison",
    "we show the @xmath13 relation that would be obtained if the donor star followed a main - sequence radius - mass relation ( the one derived from our bipolytrope code ) .",
    "this set of curves shows quantitatively how mass determinations based solely on @xmath1 are affected by the thermal bloating effect .",
    "note how the effect should go from a maximum at @xmath192 hr to quite small at @xmath193 hr .    finally , we point out that if , in fact , the period gap is in any way related to a relaxation from thermal bloating , then the inferred effect on mass determinations based on the orbital period must be approximately in the range of @xmath188 . to demonstrate this , we note that in the basic paradigm for producing the period gap , the system masses do not change from the upper boundary of the gap ( @xmath194 ) to the lower boundary ( @xmath195 ) , while the radius shrinks from its bloated state , characterized by a bloating factor , @xmath62 , to nearly its main - sequence radius at the lower edge of the gap .",
    "a simple application of kepler s 3rd law for the case of a roche - lobe filling star ( which is true at both the upper and lower edges of the gap ) shows that @xmath196 where @xmath62 must range from @xmath197 , depending on whether the period gap is taken to be 3/4 of an hour in width or 1 hour , respectively ( we have assumed that the gap is centered at 2.5 hr ) . from equation ( 6 ) we see that this value of @xmath62 should reduce the inferred mass , at the top edge of the period gap , by amounts ranging from @xmath198 , in basic agreement with our more detailed population synthesis study .",
    "( for a related discussion see beuermann et al . 1998 . )",
    "this type of discrepancy between the mass inferred for a secondary star , based on the cv orbital period and the assumption that its radius is that of a main - sequence star has probably already led to a number of incorrect mass determinations reported in the literature , particularly for systems with @xmath1 between 3 - 5.5 hr . for example , at an orbital period of 3.2 hours , the mass assigned to a cv secondary would be 0.35 m@xmath154 while our calculations show that it would actually be only 0.26 @xmath199 , although bloated in size . for a known or inferred mass ratio of say @xmath200 , we would then calculate a white dwarf mass of 0.89  m@xmath154 , when the true white dwarf mass is only 0.65  m@xmath154 .",
    "thus , ignoring the bloating effect in the secondary stars in cvs with orbital periods of 3 - 5 hr , can lead to a significant overestimation of both component masses .",
    "it is interesting to note here that the secondary stars which are farthest from thermal equilibrium are those in systems with orbital periods just above the period gap ( see figs 4 , 5 & 13 ) .",
    "observationally , this orbital period region ( 3 - 4 hr ) essentially contains only high mass transfer rate , novalike ( nl ) types of cvs .",
    "the inferred high mass transfer rates for these systems would then be expected , on theoretical grounds , to lead to a large bloating of the secondary stars , and hence lower masses than might otherwise be anticipated .",
    "precise observational determinations of the secondary star masses in nls would allow a confirmation of this basic effect which is , in fact , required if the period gap is to be explained by the interrupted magnetic braking scenario .",
    "figure 13 provides our theoretical predictions for the most likely mass of the secondary star at any given orbital period ( see table 2 ) .",
    "observational determinations accurate to a few percent would be needed in order to differentiate between the four models presented ; but , accuracies of only @xmath201 will allow a test of the bloating model in general , and the predicted deviation of the donor star from the main sequence .",
    "this is a challenging observational project , however , since the systems with orbital periods in the 3 - 5 hr range are ones in which the secondary star is rarely directly observed .",
    "ir spectral studies ( e.g. , howell , et al .",
    "2000 ; mason , et al .",
    "2000 ; dhillon , et al .",
    "1997 ) have looked in detail for the secondary star in a number of cvs with only marginally successful results . in these cvs , spectral identification of absorption features due to",
    "the secondary star is difficult since the lines are rotationally broadened and filled in by radiation from the accretion disk . for the critical 3 - 5 hr period range ,",
    "a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath202100 in the continuum will be needed to allow the atomic and molecular features of the secondary to be observed against the high background accretion - disk dominated continuum .",
    "we therefore advocate high signal - to - noise , orbital phase - resolved , near- and mid - ir spectroscopic observations with large ground - based telescopes ( e.g. , gemini , keck ) , and eventually with sirtf , of sources such as the brightest nls and other cvs which have @xmath1 = 3 - 5 hr .",
    "in this paper we briefly reviewed our current understanding of the secular evolution of cvs through their mass transfer phase , including the currently accepted model for the 2 - 3 hr  period gap \" in the orbital period distribution .",
    "the results of evolution calculations for a representative sample of individual systems are presented , both as functions of time and of orbital period .",
    "a population synthesis code , that starts with some @xmath203 primordial binaries , was then used to generate @xmath204 systems which evolve successfully through the cv phase of mass transfer .",
    "this allows for a more complete exploration of parameter space .",
    "the results are displayed as probability densities in the @xmath11 , @xmath13 , @xmath12 @xmath14 , and @xmath205 planes , for cvs at the current epoch .",
    "this method of displaying the results can lead to considerable insight into the relationships among the various system parameters .",
    "we find that for cvs with orbital periods above 5.5 hr and below the period gap ( but above the period minimum ) the secondary stars closely follow the main - sequence r - m relation ( cf .",
    "beuermann et al .",
    "however , for those with @xmath1 between 3 - 5.5",
    "hr , the effect of bloating causes them to deviate substantially from this same relation .    among our more interesting results",
    ", we have shown that the donor star masses in cvs with orbital periods just above the period gap should be as much as @xmath206 lower than would be inferred on the assumption that the donor stars obey a main - sequence radius - mass relation .",
    "this conclusion is only valid if the basic underlying cause of the period gap is thermal bloating of the donor star for systems above the period gap ( see   1 - 6 ) .",
    "on the basis of our results , we have proposed a direct observational test of , in particular , the basic paradigm of the period gap and , more generally , our overall understanding of the evolution of cvs .",
    "this test involves the challenging , but realistic , task of making relatively accurate ( e.g. , @xmath207 ) determinations of the secondary masses in about a half dozen cvs in the period range of 3 - 4 hr . if the masses are consistent with the assumption of a main - sequence radius - mass relation for the donor stars , then the currently accepted explanation of the period gap can not be correct , and the very existence of the gap would pose a major conundrum . if , on the other hand , the masses are mostly consistent with the lower values predicted in this work , then a substantial part of our basic understanding of the secular evolution of cvs will be validated .",
    "previously , much observational attention in cv studies has been focused on determinations of the white dwarf masses . while this is clearly of great interest ,",
    "we hope with this work to stimulate more interest in the important issue of determining the secondary masses .",
