    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) arises from the application of the more general theory of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) to cosmology .",
    "one of the most important predictions of lqc is that in the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker models the classical big bang singularity is avoided being replaced by a bouncing universe .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that the big bang singularity is also resolved for anisotropic bianchi type i ( bi ) @xcite , ii ( bii ) @xcite and ix @xcite .",
    "usually the matter source that was considered is a massless scalar field that play the role of internal time .",
    "the investigations have been extended to more complicated models including a perfect fluid , magnetic fields @xcite , cosmological strings @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable the fact that in all these studies it was observed that the bounce prediction is robust .    the purpose of this paper is to investigate the dynamics of a bii string cosmological model in the presence of a magnetic field in the framework of lqc .",
    "we show that a bounce occurs in a collapsing magnetized bii string cosmological model , thus extending the known cases of singularity resolution .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we outline the classical equations of a bii string cosmological model in the presence of a magnetic field . in sect .",
    "3 we discuss the quantum theory introducing the effective equations for the model .",
    "4 is devoted to numerical calculations and it is shown that the classical singularity is resolved in the bii effective quantum dynamics . finally , in sect .",
    "5 we summarize our results .",
    "the spacetime metric of bii model is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the directional scale factors .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 makes the difference between bi ( @xmath4 ) and bii ( @xmath5 ) spacetimes .",
    "having in view a comparison between the classical theory and the effective theory from lqc it is useful to rewrite the theory in terms of triads and connections .    taking into account",
    "that the spatial manifold is non - compact , one needs to introduce a fiducial cell @xmath6 with the coordinate lengths @xmath7 and the fiducial volume @xmath8 @xcite . the fiducial",
    "metric is @xmath9 with the co - triads @xmath10 and triads @xmath11    in terms of the fiducial triads @xmath12 and co - triads @xmath13 a convenient parametrization of the phase space variables @xmath14 is @xmath15 without sum over index @xmath16 .    the connection and triad components @xmath17 and @xmath18 satisfy the poisson bracket @xmath19 where @xmath20 0.2375 is barbero - immirzi parameter .",

    "@xmath24 depending on whether the frame @xmath25 is right or left handed . without any loss of generality , we will choose the orientation to be positive in the following .",
    "the hamiltonian for the matter contribution @xmath26 is proportional to the matter energy density @xmath27    the triads @xmath18 are related to the directional scale factors as @xmath28 assuming @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 with the positive orientation of the triads .",
    "the relation between the phase space variables @xmath31 and the metric variables are @xcite    @xmath32    in terms of the hubble parameters @xmath33 where the dot represents the derivative with respect to the harmonic time .",
    "einstein s equations are derived from hamilton s equations : @xmath34 where @xmath35 .    using the explicit form of the hamiltonian @xmath36 we have the following equations @xcite :    [ hamp ] @xmath37    [ hamc ] @xmath38    from the above equations of motion it can be observed that the classical solutions posses the following constants of motion :    [ const ] @xmath39    with @xmath40 constants .",
    "these equations allow us to find exact analytically solutions for @xmath41 and @xmath42 :    [ p2p3 ] @xmath43    with @xmath44 the initial values at @xmath45 of these variables .",
    "in our model the matter density @xmath46 comprises the contribution of cosmological string density @xmath47 and the energy density of the magnetic field @xmath48    the energy momentum tensor for a system of cosmic strings and magnetic field in a comoving coordinate system is given by @xmath49 where @xmath47 is the rest energy density of strings with massive particles attached to them @xcite .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the rest energy of the particles attached to the strings and @xmath52 is the tension density of the system of strings .",
    "the four velocities @xmath53 and the direction of the string @xmath54 obey the relations @xmath55    the electromagnetic field @xmath56 is taken in the form given by lichnerowich @xcite .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is homogeneous aligned along the @xmath57-direction , @xmath58 and consequently the energy density of the magnetic field is @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a constant and @xmath61 is the magnetic permeability of the medium .",
    "typically @xmath61 differs from unity only by a few parts in @xmath62 and in our numerical simulations we shall take @xmath63 .    taking into account the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , i.e. , @xmath64 , after a little manipulation one obtains @xcite : @xmath65 here we take into account that the conservation law for magnetic field fulfills identically .",
    "usually it is assumed that @xmath47 and @xmath52 are proportional @xcite : @xmath66 where the constant @xmath67 is @xmath68 for the so called geometric string , greater than @xmath68 for takabayasi string and @xmath69 for reddy string .",

    "in lqc the connection variables @xmath31 do not have direct quantum analogues and are replaced by holonomies .",
    "the quantum effects are incorporated in the _ effective _ hamiltonian , @xmath72 , constructed from the classical one , @xmath73 , by replacing the connection components @xmath31 with sine functions : @xmath74 where @xmath75 are real valued functions of the triad coefficients @xmath18 .    in",

    "in our numerical analysis we choose the units : @xmath91 .",
    "the graphics are plotted as functions of the harmonic time ( lapse function @xmath21 ) .    in order to compare the classical solutions with those of the effective equations we investigate the evolution of the directional hubble parameters , the matter density , the volume and the shear @xmath92\\,.\\ ] ]    in the figures red solid line shows the volume scale @xmath93 blue dashed line presents the density of matter @xmath46 , and black dotted lines is for the shear @xmath94 .",

    "it should be noted that the qualitative pictures of evolution are almost the same for positive or negative values of @xmath67 .",

    "again we get that the classical bii universe evolves from a singularity , while in the lqc approach all observable are finite . in the vicinity of the classical singularity",
    "the effective solution presents a bounce and subsequently the evolution is similar with the classical one .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the numerical solutions of the effective equations of the lqc dynamics for bii model .",
    "we have extended the effective lqc treatment of bii cosmologies by including cosmic strings and a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "we considered the analytical and numerical solutions of bii model at the classical and effective level .",
    "the main objective of the paper was the investigation how the classical big bang singularity is resolved and how the effective equations evolve .",
    "for this purpose we chose as a set of observable quantities like volume , string density , shear expansion and studied their evolution numerically .",
    "we showed that a big bounce occurs in a collapsing magnetized bii string universe , thus extending the known cosmological models of singularity avoidance .",
    "after the bounce the universe enters a classical regime .",
    "the numerical simulations are quite sensitive to the initial conditions regarding the directional hubble parameters . choosing a negative @xmath107 , the numerical simulations are appropriate to describe the evolution towards the big bang singularity . in the classical case",
    "the evolution stops at the singularity , while in the quantum case we have bounces and the singularity is eluded . on the other hand",
    "the choice of the initial conditions with a positive @xmath107 is adequate to have in view the evolution after the big bang . in the classical case",
    ", starting from the vicinity of the singularity , the volume of the universe tends to infinity , while the string density is smaller and smaller . in the quantum case , after a few small bounces we have for large time the same behavior as in the classical case .",
    "the study of anisotropic models with different kinds of matter sources in the framework of lqc deserves further investigations .",
    "these studies will contribute to answer the challenge question if the bouncing non - singular behavior of the effective solutions is generic .",
