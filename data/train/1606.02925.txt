    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) evolve from the low- and intermediate - mass ( @xmath1810  @xmath2 ) stars , and are common in the universe .",
    "they are characterized by rich , bright mission line spectrum that act as a vital tool to acquire knowledge of their chemical composition .",
    "this chemical information sheds lights on the basic astrophysics regarding the formation and evolution of the progenitor stars .",
    "since the @xmath3-elements are in principle not enriched through nucleosynthesis inside the low- and intermediate - mass stars , the abundances of o , ne , s , ar and cl of a pn represent the chemistry of the interstellar medium ( ism ) at the time when its progenitor star formed .",
    "the bright and narrow emission lines of pne make them not only observable at very distant ( @xmath0100  mpc ; @xcite ) galaxies but also excellent tracers of kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the traditional method for the analysis of pn spectra and deriving ionic abundances is mainly based on the strong collisionally excited lines ( cels ;",
    "also usually called the forbidden lines ) of heavy elements .",
    "however , emissivities of the cels relative to that of h@xmath4 are very sensitive to the electron temperature under typical physical conditions of the photoionized gaseous nebulae , and therefore the derived ionic abundances could be greatly underestimated if temperature fluctuations exist .",
    "these electron temperatures are derived using the traditional method based on the cel ratios @xcite .",
    "another method of nebular analysis utilizes the intensity ratio of an optical recombination line ( orl ) of either helium or a heavy element with the h@xmath4 ( see the reviews @xcite ) . unlike the cels , the relative emissivities of orls change weakly with both temperature and density because they only have a power - law dependence on the temperature and negligible dependence on the density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this method is thus much less affected by temperature fluctuations , and the abundances derived from orls are expected to be more reliable . however , accurate measurements of the heavy element orls are extremely demanding due to their weakness ( @xmath010@xmath510@xmath6 of the h@xmath4 flux , or even fainter ) , while the typical fluxes of the cels are more than 10@xmath710@xmath8 times those of the heavy element orls ( e.g. , the [ o  iii ] @xmath95007 line is usually 10 times the h@xmath4 flux ) .",

    "these new effective recombination coefficients enabled plasma diagnostics using the orls of heavy elements @xcite .",
    "nebular analyses based on the cels and orls / continua have revealed one of the key problems in nebular astrophysics : the ionic and elemental abundances of carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and neon relative to hydrogen derived from orls are systematically higher than those derived from the much brighter cels .",
    "this phenomenon , known as the `` abundance discrepancy '' , was originally noticed in the _ iue _ observations of the c@xmath10/h@xmath11 abundance ratio derived from the c  iii@xmath12 $ ] @xmath131907,1909 forbidden / semi - forbidden lines and the ground - based spectroscopic observations of the same ionic abundance derived from the c  ii @xmath94267 line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "have been suggested to explain the abundance and temperature discrepancies ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the discrepancies have been traditionally interpreted in terms of large temperature fluctuations by @xcite , who first revealed the temperature discrepancy through spectroscopic observations of h   ii regions .",
    "the temperature fluctuation model well explains the observed discrepancies in h  ii regions , but has difficulties in the interpretation of high adfs ( @xmath145 ) in pne , which needs such large temperature fluctuations that are difficult to explain physically .",
    "the bi - abundance nebular model @xcite suggests that pne ( probably also in h  ii regions ) contain a previously unknown , metal - rich component .",
    "this model well explains the problem .",
    "in this model , the faint optical recombination lines of heavy elements are mainly emitted from the ` cold ' ( @xmath11000  k ) , metal - rich ( probably h - deficient ) component , where the cooling through the infrared fine - structure lines of the heavy elements is very efficient , while the stronger cels come predominantly from the hot ( @xmath010@xmath8  k ) ionized gas with nearly solar chemical composition .",
    "deep recombination line surveys and spectroscopic analyses of galactic pne have provided strong evidence for the existence of the ` cold ' , metal - rich component ( see the review @xcite ) , although the origin of this component is still unclear .",
    "abundance calculations and temperature determinations for pne so far have all been based on the theory that free electrons have maxwell - boltzmann energy distributions @xcite , a widely accepted assumption in nebular astrophysics .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that energies of the free electrons in gaseous nebulae could deviate from the classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution and suggested that the `` @xmath15-distribution '' of electron energy that has long been observed in the solar system plasmas , can explain the temperature and abundance discrepancies .",
    "the effects of this mechanism on the nebular abundance and temperature determinations have been under investigation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "direct measurements of the electron energy distribution from observations is important to assess whether the maxwell - boltzmann distribution or the @xmath15-distribution is more suitable for the free electrons in pne .",
    "this purpose has been attempted by @xcite , who studied the c  ii dielectronic recombination lines in several pne . however ,",
    "the uncertainties are too large to make any conclusion . through studies of the h  i free - bound emission near the balmer jump of four pne with the highest adfs",
    ", @xcite found that a nebular model with two maxwell - boltzmann components , along with the @xmath15-distributed electron energies , can equally fit the observed h  i recombination continuum .",
    "a model fitting of the nebular continuum of hf2 - 2 ( adf@xmath070 ) near the balmer jump also favors the two components with maxwell - boltzmann distribution of electron energies over the @xmath15-distributed electron energies @xcite .",

    "the [ ne  iii ] temperature is probably unreliable due to two possible reasons : ( 1 ) the [ ne  iii ] @xmath133868,3967 nebular lines are in a different order of the spectrum from the [ ne  iii ] @xmath93342 auroral line , and errors might be introduced when we scaled the two orders of the spectrum to the same level and joined them together ; ( 2 ) like the auroral lines of [ n  ii ] , [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] , whose fluxes could be partially contributed by the recombination process @xcite , the [ ne  iii ] @xmath93342 auroral line might also be enhanced by the recombination process , which will lead to an overestimated electron temperature . since our flux calibration",
    "is expected to be reliable , which can be inferred from the general consistency between the temperatures diagnosed from different cel ratios ( table  [ tab : plasmadiag ] ) , the second reason might be the main cause of the relatively high temperature derived from the [ ne  iii ] line ratio . however , detailed quantitative studies are needed to confirm this .",

    "for all three pne studied , intensity ratio of the [ s  ii ] @xmath96716/@xmath96731 doublet yields relatively lower electron densities than other diagnostic ratios .",

    "[ fig : plasmadiag ] .",
    "conventionally , it is more appropriate to use the ionic abundances derived from the infrared forbidden lines instead of the recombination line abundances .    for the aforementioned cases , the cel temperatures were adopted to derive the intensity contribution from the recombination process",

    "if there is ` cold ' , metal - rich component in the nebula , the recombination contribution to the auroral line fluxes of [ n  ii ] , [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] may need to be considered . according to the previous discussion",

    "photoionization modeling is needed to estimate the relative contributions of these line fluxes from the two nebular components with largely different temperatures .",
    "it is difficult to deduce a single electron density for the three pne from the relative intensities of the high-@xmath19 balmer / paschen lines ( figs  [ fig : balmerdec ] and [ fig : paschendec ] ) by simply using a least - squares optimization .",

    "3s@xmath8p@xmath26 @xmath93334.84 , have errors much less than 10 per cent .",
    "accurate measurements of these orls and others are absolutely essential for conclusive plasma diagnostics and abundance determinations using orls .",
    "we have identified more than 200 emission lines in the deep echelle spectra of ngc6153 , m1 - 42 and hf2 - 2 , with fluxes of the faintest lines measured down to the level @xmath110@xmath30 of the h@xmath4 .",
    "emission lines were identified using the code emili .",
    "we integrated over the emission line profiles across the whole uves coverage ( 304010,940 ) to obtain line fluxes .",
    "first , we manually identify all the emission lines in the spectra , utilizing the state - of - the - art atomic database , and constructed a preliminary emission line table that contains the information of wavelengths and fluxes .",
    "later on , all items in the line table were further identified using emili , and the results were double - checked .",
    "table  [ lines ] is the final line list of the three pne .",
    "we present deep echelle spectra of three galactic high - adf pne ngc6153 , m1 - 42 and hf2 - 2 .",
    "the spectra were obtained with uves on the eso 8.2 m vlt .",
    "the high - resolution spectra cover a broad wavelength range ( @xmath0304011000 ) .",
    "numerous orls of the c , n , o and ne ions were well detected in our spectra .",
    "we analyzed the heavy element orls using the newly calculated n  ii and o  ii effective recombination coefficients .",
    "results of plasma diagnostics and abundance determinations based on orls were compared with those derived from cels .",
    "we present critical analyses of the optical recombination lines of heavy elements observed in the uves spectra of ngc6153 , m1 - 42 and hf2 - 2 . in our uves spectra of the three pne",
    ", we have detected several hundred emission lines , and 74 per cent of them are relatively faint permitted lines .",
    "we carefully identified all emission lines using the line - identification code emili .",
    "emission line fluxes of the heavy elements , mostly emitted by c  ii , n   ii , o  ii and ne  ii , were measured .",
    "tables of line fluxes were compiled so that they can be readily used by the astrophysical communities .",
    "the electron temperatures derived from the ratios of the n   ii and o  ii orls are close to 1000  k , which is lower than the average cel temperature by one order of magnitude .",
    "the n@xmath10/h@xmath11 , o@xmath10/h@xmath11 and ne@xmath10/h@xmath11 ionic abundance ratios derived from orls are higher than their cel counterparts .",
    "adfs of the heavy elements in this paper are generally consistent with the literature .",
    "the deep echelle spectra presented in this paper are not only critical for the basic nebular analysis , but also important for future detailed photoionization modeling of these high - adf pne , which will help to reveal the probable origin of the abundance and temperature discrepancies . although our current treatment of the recombination and collisional - radiative processes of n  ii @xcite and o  ii ( p.  j. storey , unpublished ; private communications ) in gaseous nebulae has been a great improvement over previous work , the atomic data for the ne  ii recombination lines that are adequate for the deep spectroscopy of nebulae are still missing .",
    "new quantum - mechanical calculations of the ne  ii effective recombination coefficients are now in progress .    through the past decades ,",
    "innovation of the observational techniques that enables accurate measurements of the faint orls of heavy elements and improvement in the calculations of atomic data , especially the recombination theories of the 2nd - row elements ( c , n , o , and ne ) in nebular conditions , have help us to better understand the orl versus cel `` abundance and temperature discrepancies '' observed in pne ( also in h  ii regions ) .",
    "although several mechanisms have been raised to explain the observed discrepancies in the nebulae , including temperature fluctuations , density inhomogeneities , bi - abundance nebular model , and the @xmath15-distributed electrons , considerable debate of these problems continues .",
    "future high - spatial and high - spectral resolution spectroscopy with the next - generation large telescopes may advance the study of these long - standing problems , and even stimulate new topics in nebular astrophysics . in the meantime ,",
    "sophisticated photoionization modeling as well as relativistic quantum - mechanical calculations of the atomic data for nebular physics , is still needed to reach further understanding in this area .",
