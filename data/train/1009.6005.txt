    "the mass spectrum of dark - matter ( dm ) halos collapsing from an initial gaussian - perturbed density field has long been an object of study ; the formalism most widely used today is that of @xcite , who derived a number density of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of halos in the mass range @xmath13 to @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the mean mass density , @xmath16 is the critical ( linear ) density for collapse , and @xmath17 is the rms perturbation .",
    "if we consider small scales , where @xmath17 is both @xmath18 and approximately independent of mass , then the press - schechter form reduces to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the luminosity function of galaxies is commonly parametrized in the schechter form @xcite , @xmath20 i.e. , a power - law of slope @xmath1 at the low - luminosity end with an exponential cutoff at a characteristic luminosity @xmath21 .",
    "if star formation traced the underlying dark matter distribution exactly ( i.e. a constant mass - to - light ratio ) , we would expect to observe @xmath22 at the faint end .",
    "however , galaxy surveys such as the sdss have consistently shown a different slope , in the range of @xmath23 ( see @xcite , table 2 of @xcite , and @xcite ) . the extent to which galaxies or dark - matter halos fail to follow the clustering distribution of linear perturbation theory",
    "is known generally as `` bias '' , and has been an active area of phenomenological and theoretical research ( see , e.g. , the introduction to @xcite and  6 of @xcite for an overview ) : most relevant here is the relative bias between galaxies and dm halos , i.e. the extent to which galaxies fail to follow the underlying dm . at the low - mass end ,",
    "the discrepancy has come to be called the `` missing satellites problem '' @xcite , since nave press - schechter theory predicts @xmath24 satellite galaxies for the local group , while only @xmath25 are observed @xcite ",
    "although this number continues to increase as data from e.g. sdss are analyzed .",
    "one might expect that this relative bias would be a concern for those performing galaxy simulations , and indeed dm - only simulations which assign galaxies to dm halos after the fact ( e.g. , the millennium run of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do use an ad - hoc prescription to reduce the baryonic mass in small halos , or overpredict small halos @xcite , although agreement is improving as semianalytic models improve in sophistication @xcite .",
    "however , hydrodynamic simulations seem to require no such prescription : they most often report a faint - end mass spectrum slope in the vicinity of -0.9 ",
    "-1.2 @xcite .",
    "while there are some exceptions ( @xcite report @xmath26 for their best - fit model ; @xcite find @xmath27 ) , it would appear this is a result which is difficult to get wrong .",
    "@xcite were the first to propose a mechanism of gas being heated ( by local supernovae ) and driven out of low - mass halos .",
    "@xcite introduced the idea of the ionizing background radiation being the relevant mechanism , and @xcite used a smooth particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulation to show that a photoionizing background does strongly inhibit the cooling and infall of gas into halos of virial mass below @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite did the same with a 1d lagrangian code .",
    "@xcite showed that the uv background reduced the cooled gas accreted to disk galaxies by half , with late - accreting gas preferentially affected .",
    "@xcite used simulations of reionization to determine that the mass scale at which gas is stripped by photoionization from the background radiation corresponds to the `` filtering '' length scale , the scale at which baryonic matter is smoothed compared to the underlying dark matter in linear perturbation theory ; however @xcite using gadget-2 found a somewhat smaller critical mass of @xmath29 ( similar values were obtained by @xcite and @xcite ) and , significantly , reported that their sph result was well approximated by a simple prescription comparing the gas temperature to the virial temperature of the halo . @xcite and @xcite made semianalytic calculations of galaxy evolution and likewise found that galaxies fainter than @xmath21 have their star formation suppressed or `` squelched '' by a photoionizing background .",
    "meanwhile , the role of supernova feedback in driving gas from small halos and thereby suppressing star formation has continued to be studied @xcite . @xcite",
    "have even performed a simulation showing that the uv output of local stars can affect the sfr . however , while these processes are certainly present and important , our focus here is on the ionizing background , which we will show to be both necessary and sufficient to reproduce the observed schechter @xmath1 .",
    "it should be noted that despite the terminology of `` critical '' or `` cutoff '' masses , a sharp cutoff in galaxy masses is not consistent with the observations : there are low - mass ( dwarf ) galaxies , merely fewer than expected .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this .",
    "@xcite proposed that some intermediate - mass halos ( @xmath30 km / s , or @xmath31 ) have star formation at early times , then lose their remaining gas at the time of reionization and become `` red and dead '' dwarfs at the present .",
    "@xcite suggested that present dwarf satellites such as those around the milky way were originally larger but were reduced to their present size by tidal stripping .",
    "such mechanisms may be needed to explain the very low luminosity ( @xmath32 ) milky way satellites discovered in recent years @xcite .",
    "two recent studies are of particular interest .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of dwarf galaxies in isolation and found that both feedback and a uv background are necessary to reproduce the observed properties of the local group dwarf spheroidals .",
    "in particular , they saw that the uv background efficiently suppresses star formation after the epoch of reionization for systems below @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , @xcite simulate a milky way - like galaxy and its satellites and find a threshold circular speed of 12 km / s ( @xmath34 ) for halos which can form stars .",
    "we also note that even though it has been known at least since @xcite that including the x - ray background has a substantial effect on the tempterature of the igm ( and hence , as we will see , on star formation ) , few simulations have incorporated this component .",
    "@xcite studied its effect on dwarf galaxies and found a critical baryon retention mass , but only looked at @xmath35 .",
    "we remedy this deficit by including an x - ray background in some of our simulations to study its effect on small galaxies from moderate redshift to the present .    in a previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we explored the effect of the ionizing background on the stellar and gas properties of large elliptical galaxies . here",
    ", we use a similar set of uv and x - ray backgrounds to examine their effect on the low end of the galaxy mass spectrum , namely the satellites of those ellipticals .",
    "section 2 presents a simple physical argument for why any efficient gas - heating mechanism will yield a flattening of the low - mass slope .",
    "section 3 presents the details of the simulations we performed to test this argument ; section [ sect : results ] gives the results of the same .",
    "section [ sect : disc ] is discussion and conclusions .",
    "our argument , which dates back to @xcite and @xcite , compares the escape velocity of gas in a virialized halo to the sound speed of that gas .",
    "the escape velocity for a halo of mass @xmath13 and radius @xmath36 is given by @xmath37    we relate @xmath13 and @xmath36 by fixing the density at the standard `` virialized '' value , @xmath38    where @xmath15 is the mean density of the universe at a given epoch ( we calculate the result for @xmath39 , and assume @xmath40 , as in our simulations ) . then the escape velocity becomes    @xmath41    the sound speed , meanwhile , is given for a gas of temperature @xmath42 and mean particle mass @xmath43 by    @xmath44    where we assume the adiabatic index @xmath45 for non - relativistic gas , and for @xmath43 we assume primordial abundances of h and he . by equating these speeds , we have a formula for a critical mass : @xmath46 at a given gas temperature , halos below this critical mass will have gas thermal speeds greater than their escape velocities .",
    "hence they will not be able to hold on to their gas , and therefore be unable to form stars .",
    "for a temperature of @xmath47 k , corresponding to the peak of the h cooling curve , @xmath48 .",
    "therefore we expect halos with less than this total mass to have very little star formation , and at late times , very little baryonic mass of any kind , assuming there is a mechanism to heat the gas to @xmath49 k by the epoch where star formation in these halos would be significant .",
    "heating above this temperature will further increase the cutoff mass .",
    "moreover , since larger systems are formed by the hierarchical assembly of smaller ones , we expect this baryon deficit to creep to larger - mass halos as time passes , effectively increasing the critical mass at the present by some factor @xmath50 .",
    "to verify the physical argument presented above , we analyze several high - resolution simulations that are performed with various ionizing ( uv and x - ray ) backgrounds .",
    "these simulations were performed with a slightly updated version of the gadget-2-based code used in ; refer to that work for additional details . in brief",
    ", the code is based on gadget-2 , and the halos are selected from a ( 50 mpc)@xmath51 box with cosmological ( @xmath52cdm ) initial conditions , and resimulated in a ( 1 mpc)@xmath51 box centered on each halo , with the central ( 0.5 mpc)@xmath51 using high - resolution dm and gas / star particles ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since we specifically select high - density regions containing massive galaxies , our results are not necessarily applicable to other environments . to ameliorate the effects of cosmic variance",
    ", we choose seven galaxies ( that is , seven initial - conditions ( ic ) boxes ) , with final virial masses in the range @xmath53 .",
    "the simulations do not include optical depth effects , in particular the self - shielding of dense star - forming regions from the uv background .",
    "they do ( differently from ) include feedback from supernovae though not agn , following the two - phase @xcite model , and a simple prescription for metal - line cooling using cooling rates calculated by cloudy ( v07.02 , last described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which presumes photoionization and collisional equilibrium for the gas and metal atoms , and assumes @xmath54 solar metallicity .",
    "star formation is performed at a fixed density threshold calculated by the code such that @xmath55 of the gas above the threshold will be in cold phase : this threshold is @xmath56  g  @xmath57 or @xmath58  @xmath57 .",
    "star particles have half the mass of original gas particles ; thus each gas particle can ultimately turn into two star particles . as in , all simulations were performed with initially @xmath59 each of sph ( i.e. baryon ) particles and dm particles , with a gravitational softening length of 0.25 kpc for the gas and star particles and twice that for the dark matter particles .",
    "gas and star particles have masses in the range @xmath60 , depending on the size of the box ; the assumed cosmology is @xmath61 .",
    "we run these simulations using a variety of ionizing backgrounds : the same set which was used in , with two additions .",
    "the first , which we call no uv , has as the name suggests no ionizing radiation at all .",
    "the next three backgrounds are old uv , an updated version of @xcite ; new uv , which has the same spectrum as old uv but an intensity ( as measured by e.g. the h photoionization rate ) which declines as @xmath62 above the peak at @xmath63 ; and fg uv , the background constructed in @xcite .",
    "the final two backgrounds add an x - ray component , which has a spectrum taken from @xcite and a normalization from @xcite .",
    "the new uv+x model takes the new uv model and adds this x - ray component with the same redshift dependence , while fg uv+x adds this component to the fg uv background but with the redshift dependence of old uv ( i.e. * ? ? ? * ) to more closely replicate the quasar background that the x - ray component is meant to model .",
    "the quasar background peaks at @xmath64 and becomes negligible for @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "having performed the simulations , we identify virialized systems in both the star and total ( stars plus gas plus dm ) particle populations using ahf , the amiga halo finder @xcite .",
    "ahf uses a density grid - tree method followed by the removal of unbound particles to find halos and subhalos , and returns the virial mass of each .",
    "the virial mass is defined as the total mass of all ( relevant ) particles inside the virial radius , which in turn is defined as the radius where the calculated density profile exceeds a threshold multiple of the critical density determined by cosmology and redshift ( @xmath66 ) ; for subhalos the virial radius is instead the largest radius of any particle which is gravitationally bound to the halo .",
    "see the ahf documentation for details .",
    "figure  [ fig : fracts ] shows the mass distribution of stellar systems ( identified using star particles only ) .",
    "ahf can identify systems as small as @xmath67 , or about 40 star particles , but we adopt @xmath68 as a lower mass limit to ensure completeness .",
    "the mean number of systems ( averaged over the seven ics ) in the lowest mass decade @xmath69 declines from @xmath70 with no uv to @xmath71 with the three uv models and @xmath72 for the two uv plus x - ray cases , differences of @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively , while the number in the two highest mass bins @xmath75 remains nearly constant . as an aside",
    ", we expect these highest - mass bins will be high compared to the global spectrum because we specifically select boxes which contain a massive galaxy ; furthermore , systems of this virial mass ( @xmath76 ) have stellar masses which are very vulnerable to suppression by agn feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , not included here .",
    "we also see that the uv - only models ( old  uv , fg  uv and new  uv ) are essentially identical to each other in mass spectrum .",
    "the two models with x - rays ( new  uv+x and fg  uv+x ) are also identical to each other , though of course quite different from the models without x - rays .",
    "this suggests that the details of the ionizing background above @xmath77 , including the epoch of reionization , are relatively unimportant in determining the mass spectrum .    .",
    "the error bars represent @xmath78 statistical errors among the 7 initial conditions .",
    "also included is an @xmath79 power law for comparison .",
    "the number of @xmath80 m@xmath81 galaxies decreases markedly as one adds first uv and then x - ray radiation . ]    using the bayesian inference method of @xcite , we estimate the schechter parameters @xmath1 and @xmath82 ; the results for @xmath1 are presented in table  [ tab : sch ] .",
    "this method has the advantage of not requiring any binning of the data .",
    "values for @xmath82 were roughly constant for the various background models in the range @xmath83 ; also note that we use stellar mass as a proxy for luminosity without considering , e.g. , age .",
    "consistent with the appearance of figure  [ fig : fracts ] , @xmath1 increases dramatically from @xmath84 for the no - background case to roughly @xmath85 for the uv - only models and @xmath86 for the models with x - rays .",
    "thus we see that the addition of a simple uv ionizing background was the only change necessary ( with feedback ; see below ) to move the low end of the stellar mass spectrum into consistency with observations , while an additional x - ray background ( which most simulations historically have not used ) seems to make the slope _ too _ flat .",

    "the last two rows , below the line , are the @xmath90 simulations of halo a.    next , we test the validity of our physical argument by comparing the mean gas temperature of the simulations at @xmath77 ( when the small systems are forming ) to their critical cutoff masses at @xmath39 .",

    "vertical and horizontal error bars represent @xmath78 statistical errors among the 7 ics .",
    "we find @xmath95 , in good agreement with the theoretical value of 1.5 . ]    finally , we examine the level of numerical convergence in our results .",
    "we perform simulations of galaxy a with @xmath90 sph particles ( i.e. twice the spatial resolution and eight times the mass resolution ) with the no uv and fg uv backgrounds ( and including feedback ) . due to computational constraints",
    ", the no  uv simulation was run only to @xmath96 , and the fg uv to @xmath97 . at @xmath96 , the schechter @xmath1 values for no uv and fg uv with @xmath90 resolution",
    "are @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "these values are more similar than the @xmath59 runs , which have @xmath26 for no uv and @xmath100 for fg uv at the same redshift .",
    "the steepening slope for fg uv as resolution increases is explained by smaller stellar systems which are allowed by the higher peak densities associated with increased mass resolution , and which merge away at late times to flatten the low - mass slope once again ( whereas no  uv can keep making new small systems ) .",
    "indeed , at @xmath97 , fg uv @xmath90 has @xmath101 , compared to the @xmath59 run @xmath102 ( and no uv @xmath59 @xmath103 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the no uv @xmath90 simulation at @xmath96 still has a large number of small stellar systems which have not yet formed stars , and whose gas is disrupted by the background in the fg uv run .",
    "in fact , 65% of the identified halos in no  uv @xmath90 at @xmath96 are in this category , compared to only 39% for the @xmath59 case . however , the overall baryon - conversion efficiency is not significantly different as a function of resolution , at either @xmath96 ( @xmath104 difference ) or @xmath97 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the last two rows of table  [ tab : hist ] show the breakdown by mass .",
    "fg  uv @xmath90 has a much lower efficiency than @xmath59 in the low mass bin at @xmath97 .",
    "this is the result of the same mechanism just discussed : the increased resolution allows small halos to form and merge while remaining star - free because of the uv background .",
    "further , at @xmath96 fg  uv @xmath90 has a higher efficiency than no  uv @xmath90 .",
    "this is again the effect of proximity : while no  uv has twice the number of halos in the low - mass bin as fg  uv , fg  uv s are preferentially close to the central galaxy and thus have lower virial masses and more efficient star formation , and increased numerical resolution allows them to exist even closer without being lost to the halo finder .",
    "( at the 25^th^ percentile of galaxies , fg uv has roughly a tenth the efficiency of no uv in this mass bin at both resolutions . ) finally , the @xmath106 statistic is not strongly affected by the increase in resolution : at @xmath96 , @xmath107 for ( no uv , fg uv ) , compared to @xmath108 for the respective @xmath59 runs .",
    "thus we assert that our results at @xmath39 would not be qualitatively different with increased resolution , and quantitatively different by at most 15% .",
    "in , we examined the detailed effects on galaxy properties of modest changes to the ionizing radiation background ( specifically the intensity at high @xmath109 ) . here",
    "we have simulated seven different galaxies with their satellites , using six different models of the ionizing background , and found that any uv background is sufficient to replicate the observational results of the low end of the galaxy mass spectrum , as parametrized by schechter @xmath1 .",
    "the details of the spectrum and redshift dependence of the background seem to have no significant effect .",
    "we find that the number of small ( @xmath110 in stars ) systems at @xmath39 correlates with the critical star - free halo mass , which in turn correlates well with the mean gas temperature at @xmath77 .",
    "further , the value of our critical mass agrees with other recent studies of small galaxies .",
    "these simulation results are consistent with our theoretical picture , where only halos with an escape velocity greater than the sound speed of the gas can retain their gas long enough for it to cool and form stars .",
    "thus we find the addition of an x - ray background causes additional suppression of low - mass halos ( by further increasing the mean temperature of the gas ) , making the low - mass spectrum too flat compared with observations .",
    "it is possible that this is the result of optical depth / self - shielding effects not being included in the code , thus making the uv background more efficient at heating / ionization than it is in reality .",
    "optical depth in general decreases with harder radiation , so the optically - thin assumption is valid for x - rays .",
    "however , the small halos which we study here have the lowest densities and thus are the least effective self - shielders : @xcite found that systems below the threshold mass of @xmath33 had their gas densities sufficiently reduced by feedback and that self - shielding of the uv background was not important .",
    "our resolution study weakly indicates that @xmath1 may decrease with increasing resolution , and a future paper ( hambrick et al . , 2010 , in prep . )",
    "finds that including agn thermal feedback causes @xmath1 to decrease modestly as well , presumably by driving gas back out of the central galaxy to form stars in satellites .",
    "this is certainly an area deserving further study .",
    "we also study the baryon - conversion efficiencies of small halos , and find that for small halos in the neighborhood of massive ones , and find that the background is at least equally important as sn feedback for lowering the efficiency to observed values , in contrast to isolated dwarfs where feedback is the dominant mechanism .    in sum",
    ", reproducing the observed numbers of low - mass galaxies in hydrodynamic simulations is no problem at all , being adequately resolved by the heating mechanisms already included in standard hydro codes : feedback and the ionizing background .",

    "<S> even though the dark - matter power spectrum in the absence of biasing predicts a number density of halos @xmath0 ( i.e. a schechter @xmath1 value of @xmath2 ) at the low - mass end @xmath3 , hydrodynamic simulations have typically produced values for stellar systems in good agreement with the observed value @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we explain this with a simple physical argument and show that an efficient external gas - heating mechanism ( such as the uv background included in all hydro codes ) will produce a critical halo mass below which halos can not retain their gas and form stars . </S>",
    "<S> we test this conclusion with gadget-2-based simulations using various uv backgrounds , and for the first time we also investigate the effect of an x - ray background . </S>",
    "<S> we show that at the present epoch @xmath1 is depends primarily on the mean gas temperature at the star - formation epoch for low - mass systems ( @xmath5 ) : with no background we find @xmath6 , with uv only @xmath7 , and with uv and x - rays @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we find the critical final halo mass for star formation to be @xmath9 with a uv background and @xmath10 with uv and x - rays .    </S>",
