    "since no entangled state can be created from an unentangled one by locc , we regard entanglement as a resource in this context . in the case of the bipartite pure states ,",
    "the picture of how this resource can be quantified and how it can be transformed ( by locc ) is quite well developed : for bipartite pure states the entanglement of distillation , @xmath0 , and the entanglement cost , @xmath1 , have been shown to both be equal to the entropy of entanglement ( for a review see plenio and virmani @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are equal , locc transformation of bipartite pure state entanglement is asymptotically reversible , and the entropy of entanglement is a unique measure of the amount of entanglement available in the many copy limit .    for mixed bipartite states ,",
    "entanglement transformations are not in general asymptotically reversible , and consequently , locc no longer induces a unique measure of the amount of entanglement ( in the asymptotic regime ) .",
    "for instance , there are bound entangled states ( which by definition have zero entanglement of distillation ) which have been shown to have non - zero entanglement cost @xcite .",
    "this has motivated the search for non - trivial extensions of locc , with respect to which entanglement transformations are asymptotically reversible for all bipartite states .",
    "recently , plenio and brando @xcite proved that the set of operations which asymptotically can not generate entanglement is such a set , with the regularised relative entropy of entanglement as the corresponding measure of entanglement .",
    "an open conjecture @xcite is that the set of ppt operations @xcite ( defined later in this section ) also renders bipartite entanglement transformations asymptotically reversible ( in @xcite it is shown that it does so for the anti - symmetric werner state ) .    for exact , finite transformations , the problem of determining when a given pure bipartite state can be deterministically converted into another by locc is completely solved by nielsen s majorization theorem @xcite : the process is possible if and only if the schmidt coefficient vector of the initial state is majorized by that of the final state .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate exact , finite transformations of pure states by ppt operations .",
    "this topic was first treated by ishizaka and plenio @xcite ) , where the emphasis is on conversion of locc - inequivalent forms of multi - partite entanglement ( e.g. ghz and w states for three parties ) by ppt operations . in the present work",

    "if the deterministic transformation of a state @xmath2 into @xmath3 can be accomplished by the class of operations @xmath4 then we write @xmath5 ; if it can not be then we write @xmath6 . in discussing the transformation of bipartite pure states by any class of operations which contains locc , we need only consider the schmidt coefficients of the states since states with the same schmidt coefficients are equivalent up to local unitary transformations ( which are obviously contained in locc ) .",
    "since we are only concerned here with classes that include locc , we will use the state    @xmath7    ( where @xmath8 for orthonormal bases @xmath9 , @xmath10 for alice and bob s quotients of the bipartite hilbert space ) as a representative of all states with schmidt coefficient vector @xmath11 without loss of generality .",
    "we use @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) to denote the vector obtained by putting the components of @xmath11 in non - decreasing ( non - increasing ) order .    using this notation , nielsen s theorem is @xmath14 where the majorization relation is defined on vectors in @xmath15 whose components sum to one by @xmath16 we shall use @xmath17 to denote a maximally entangled state of rank @xmath18 ( where we assume that @xmath19 ) .",
    "we will use the symbol @xmath20 to denote the partial transpose an operator @xmath21 .",
    "we define the ( linear ) partial transpose map by @xmath22 clearly this is basis dependent , but the eigenvalues ( and hence the positivity ) of the partial transpose of an operator does not depend on this basis choice . for convenience we will use the same basis that we are using as our representative schmidt basis .",
    "the set of ppt operations on a bipartite system is the set of completely positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) maps @xmath23 such that the composition @xmath24 is also completely positive , where @xmath25 denotes the partial transpose map @xmath26 .",
    "equivalently , ppt maps are cptp maps that _ completely _ preserve the ppt property of states in the same sense that completely positive maps _",
    "completely _ preserve non - negativity of states : any extension of a ppt map on a system q onto a larger system qr where we apply the original map on q and the identity map on r is ppt preserving ( it maps ppt states to ppt states ) .",

    "we discuss some necessary conditions for general bipartite pure state transformations by ppt .",
    "after that we provide part of the theory analogous to nielsen s theory for deterministic transformations of pure bipartite states by ppt operations . in particular ,",
    "we look at the case where the initial state is maximally entangled . in section [ sec : frommax ] we provide a necessary condition for transformations of this type , which we conjecture is also sufficient . we make use of this result in section [ sec : cat ] to show that the phenomenon of catalysis @xcite can occur for ppt operations and give a necessary and sufficient condition for when this can occur if both the initial state and catalyst state are maximally entangled .",
    "we conclude with some suggestions for future work , including a conjecture for extending this condition to arbitrary initial and catalyst states .",
    "determining whether a particular pure state transformation can be carried out by a ppt operation can in fact be formulated as a semidefinite programming problem @xcite , the difficulty is in phrasing the relevant constraints in terms of conditions on the schmidt coefficients of the pure states .",
    "here we show that certain rnyi entropies of the schmidt coefficient vectors correspond to operationally motivated ppt monotones ( allowing us to give some necessary conditions for transformations ) .    for completeness let us define these operational monotones for any class of operations @xmath21 : let @xmath2 be a density operator in @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the set of hermitian operators on the hilbert space @xmath34 .",
    "the distillable entanglement of @xmath2 under the class of operations @xmath21 is defined by @xmath35 and the exact distillable entanglement by @xmath36 where in both cases @xmath37 is a sequence of completely positive trace preserving ( cptp ) maps such that each map , @xmath38 , takes @xmath39 to @xmath40 and belongs to the class @xmath21 .    the entanglement cost of a state @xmath2 , we define by @xmath41 and the exact entanglement cost by @xmath42 where in both cases @xmath37 is a sequence of cptp maps such that each map , @xmath38 , takes @xmath40 to @xmath43 and belongs to the class @xmath21 .    the entanglement cost @xmath44 and distillable entanglement @xmath45 of @xmath46 are both equal to @xmath47 , the entropy of entanglement of the state .",

    "hence @xmath48 since the opposite inequalities are trivial by locc @xmath49 ppt , we conclude that @xmath50 thus coinciding with the corresponding locc entanglement cost and distillable entanglement : the entropy of entanglement .",
