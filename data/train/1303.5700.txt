    "the recent discovery of a higgs boson with mass in the 125 - 126gev range at the lhc  @xcite and experimental confirmation of the neutrino - mixing parameter @xmath0 that is nonnegligible  @xcite undoubtedly have far - reaching implications for efforts to identify the nature of physics beyond the standard model  ( sm ) .",
    "any realistic scenario for new physics would need to incorporate such a  particle and account for neutrino masses and mixing angles of the right amount .",
    "in addition , since about 22% of the total cosmic energy density has been inferred from astronomical observations to be attributable to matter that is nonluminous and nonabsorbing  @xcite , the desired new - physics model should also possess at least one candidate for dark matter  ( dm ) .    among the simplest possibilities accommodating the necessary ingredients",
    "is the scotogenic model proposed by ma  @xcite , in which neutrinos get mass radiatively via their one - loop interactions with new particles comprising scalars and fermions , at least one of which plays the role of  dm . here",
    "we explore some implications of the aforementioned experimental findings within the context of the minimal version of this model .",
    "in particular , identifying the newly observed higgs boson with the higgs boson in the model , hereafter denoted by  @xmath3 , and assuming the lightest one of the new fermions to be the  dm , we consider the decays of @xmath3 into final states containing the nonstandard particles in the model .",
    "moreover , since their yukawa couplings depend on the neutrino - mixing angles and contribute to the decay amplitudes , it is important to adopt parametrization for the couplings that takes into account the fact that @xmath0 is not negligibly small .",
    "subsequently , we will demonstrate that such exotic decays of @xmath3 are allowed by various experimental and theoretical constraints to have substantial rates that are already bounded by the existing lhc data . as upcoming measurements at the lhc will pin down the various properties of @xmath3 with increasing precision",
    ", the acquired data will then either reveal hints of the new particles or probe the model more stringently .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "the next section gives a description of the relevant lagrangians and the neutrino mass formula . in section  [ matrices ] , we write down a neutrino - mixing matrix that depends on only two parameters and is consistent with the neutrino - oscillation data , including the measured nonzero @xmath4 , at the one - sigma level . from the resulting neutrino - mass matrix ,",
    "we derive solutions for the yukawa couplings of the new particles in the model . in  section  [ constraints ] , we look at a number of experimental and theoretical constraints on their couplings and masses . specifically , there are low - energy measurements that can limit the yukawa couplings .",
    "furthermore , the yukawa couplings belonging to the dm candidate also have to be compatible with the observed relic abundance . in  section  [ higgsdecays ] , with the parameter values satisfying the preceding constraints",
    ", we investigate the higgs decays into final states involving the nonstandard particles and take into account extra constraints from the latest lhc data , including those on the higgs decays into @xmath1 and  @xmath2 .",
    "we also examine the scotogenic impact on the correlations between these different decays .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results in  section  [ summary ] .",
    "in its simplest version , the scotogenic model extends the minimal sm with the addition of only a scalar doublet , @xmath5 , and three neutral singlet fermions , @xmath6 , all of which are odd under an exactly conserved @xmath7 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the sm particles are all even under this symmetry .",
    "accordingly , the lightest one of the new particles is stable and can act as  dm . in this study , we consider the case that @xmath8 is a good candidate for cold  dm  @xcite .",
    "being warm dm has also been proposed in the literature  @xcite . ]",
    "the lagrangian for the interactions of the scalar particles in this model with each other and the standard su(2)@xmath9u(1)@xmath10 gauge bosons , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , has the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , after electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath16 with @xmath17 @xmath18 being the usual su(2)@xmath19 @xmath20 gauge coupling constant , @xmath21 the pauli matrices , @xmath22 the hypercharge operator , and @xmath23 the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath24 .",
    "the vev of @xmath5 is zero due to the @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "the masses of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are then , respectively , @xmath28 in our numerical analysis in sections@xmath29[constraints ] and  [ higgsdecays ] , we will make the usual assumption  @xcite that @xmath30 is very small , @xmath31 , which implies that @xmath32 . from eq.([l ] ) , the couplings of @xmath5 to @xmath3 , the photon @xmath33 , and the @xmath34 boson are described by @xmath35 \\frac{h}{v } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\ ; i e\\,\\bigl(h^+\\,\\partial^\\rho h^--h^-\\,\\partial^\\rho h^+\\bigr ) a_\\rho^ { } \\,+\\ , e^2\\,h^+h^- a^2 \\,+\\ , \\frac{e g\\,\\bigl(1 - 2s_{\\rm w}^2\\bigr)}{c_{\\rm w}^{}}\\,h^+h^- a^\\rho z_\\rho^ { } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\ ; \\frac{g}{2c_{\\rm w}^ { } } \\bigl [ { \\cal p}\\,\\partial^\\rho{\\cal s}-{\\cal s}\\,\\partial^\\rho{\\cal p } \\,+\\ , i\\bigl(1 - 2s_{\\rm w}^2\\bigr ) \\bigl(h^+\\,\\partial^\\rho h^--h^-\\,\\partial^\\rho h^+\\bigr ) \\bigr ] z_\\rho^ { } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where only terms relevant to our processes of interest are on display , @xmath36 is the electromagnetic charge , and @xmath37 with the weinberg angle @xmath38 .",

    "hence , writing the yukawa couplings @xmath43 , we have @xmath44    in this model the light neutrinos get mass radiatively through one - loop diagrams involving internal @xmath45 or @xmath46 and @xmath6 .",
    "the mass eigenvalues @xmath47 of the neutrinos are given by  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the pmns ( pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata  @xcite ) unitary matrix and the expression for @xmath50 is valid for @xmath51 .",
    "we express the pmns mixing matrix as a product of two matrices involving only two mixing angles , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , with the latter matrix also containing a @xmath54-violating phase @xmath55 .",
    "thus @xmath56 the form of @xmath49 with @xmath57 was discussed in ref.@xcite , whereas the @xmath58 case was treated in  ref.@xcite .",
    "both of these possibilities for @xmath49 are no longer compatible with the most recent findings , especially that @xmath0 is not negligibly small  @xcite",
    ". therefore , we will instead take @xmath59 which lead numerically to elements of @xmath49 consistent with their empirical counterparts within one sigma . for simplicity",
    ", we also fix @xmath60 in accordance with the value @xmath61 from the latest fit to the global data  @xcite .    incorporating eq.([u ] ) into the matrix diagonalization relation in eq.([umu ] ) , we then derive the mass eigenvalues @xmath62 c_\\theta^{}\\,c_\\varsigma^ { } \\nonumber \\\\ & & ~\\ , + \\mbox{$\\frac{1}{2}$ } \\bigl [ ( y_{\\mu k}-y_{\\tau k})s_\\theta^{}\\,c_\\varsigma^{}+(y_{\\mu k}+y_{\\tau k})s_\\varsigma^ { } \\bigr]^2 \\bigr\\}_{\\vphantom{\\int}}\\lambda_k ~ , \\nonumber \\\\ m_2^ { } & \\,=&\\ , \\bigl [ \\mbox{$\\frac{1}{2}$ } ( y_{\\mu k}-y_{\\tau k})^2c_\\theta^2 + \\sqrt2\\;y_{e k}^{}(y_{\\mu k}-y_{\\tau k})c_\\theta^{}\\,s_\\theta^ { } + y_{e k}^2\\,s_\\theta^2 \\bigr]_{\\vphantom{\\int_|^|}}^{\\vphantom{\\int } } \\lambda_k ~ , \\nonumber \\\\ m_3^ { }   & \\,=&\\ , \\bigl\\ { y_{e k}^2\\,c_\\theta^2\\,s_\\varsigma^2 + \\sqrt2\\ , y_{e k}^ { } \\bigl [ ( y_{\\mu k}+y_{\\tau k})c_\\varsigma^{}-(y_{\\mu k}-y_{\\tau k})s_\\theta^{}\\,s_\\varsigma^ { } \\bigr ] c_\\theta^{}\\,s_\\varsigma^ { } \\nonumber \\\\ & & ~\\ , + \\mbox{$\\frac{1}{2}$ } \\bigl [ ( y_{\\mu k}+y_{\\tau k})c_\\varsigma^{}-(y_{\\mu",

    "it turns out that these equations are exactly solvable for @xmath67 and @xmath68 in terms of @xmath69 .",
    "as sketched in appendix  [ yjk ] , there are twenty - seven possible sets of solutions to  eq.([conditions ] ) , but three of the sets can each produce only one nonzero mass out of @xmath70 in eq.([numass ] ) , whereas another eighteen ( six ) of the sets can each lead to two ( three ) nonzero masses .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the form of eq.([mnu ] ) also appears in some other models of radiative neutrino mass , which may be generated by one - loop  @xcite or two - loop  @xcite diagrams .",
    "hence these solutions for @xmath65 plus the resulting masses @xmath71 are also applicable to such models , with @xmath72 encoding the model specifics .",
    "the solutions in one of the eighteen sets that can each yield two nonzero masses are @xmath73 these lead to the masses @xmath74 setting @xmath58 in the last two equations , one recovers the corresponding expressions derived in  ref.@xcite . since it is now known experimentally that @xmath75  @xcite , which is not very small , the @xmath58 limit is no longer a good approximation .",
    "particularly , as shown below , this nonzero @xmath4 corresponds to @xmath76 and @xmath77 in  eq.([332 ] ) , compared to @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the @xmath58 case  @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we will employ nonzero @xmath53 according to eq.([choice ] ) and focus on one of the solution sets as an example that gives three nonzero masses .",
    "the solutions in this set are @xmath80 which yield @xmath81 these expressions for @xmath70 would permit cancellations among the terms in @xmath82 with larger @xmath83 than would the masses in  eq.([mass332 ] ) .    numerically",
    ", we adopt for definiteness @xmath84 which translate into elements of @xmath49 that are well within the one - sigma ranges of their experimental values .",
    "these choices imply the numbers collected in table  [ ym ] for the yukawa couplings and neutrino masses given in the previous two paragraphs in terms of @xmath85 and  @xmath86 . after applying eqs.@xmath29([123 ] ) and  ( [ mass123 ] ) to the constraints to be discussed in the following section , we will employ the allowed parameter values to explore several decay modes of the higgs boson @xmath3 .",
    ".numerical values of @xmath87 and neutrino masses in terms of @xmath88 from the formulas in eqs .",
    "( [ 332])-([mass123 ] ) , with the input parameters in  eq.([numchoice]).[ym ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the substantial values of @xmath89 in this table are made possible by partial cancellations in @xmath90 between the terms proportional to @xmath91 according to eq .",
    "( [ mass123 ] ) and in the @xmath92 rates between the different @xmath93 terms with opposite signs , as table  [ ym ] indicates , which allow @xmath94 not to be too suppressed by the stringent constraints .",
    "some of such cancellations would not happen with solution sets of the type in eq .",
    "( [ 332 ] ) .",
    "we should mention , however , that the rather sizable @xmath94 can result only with some degree of fine - tuning , roughly at the per - mill level . for such @xmath83 and the masses in table@xmath29[numbers ]",
    ", we can reproduce the measured @xmath95 with @xmath96 .    to make comparison with lhc results",
    ", we find that the larger ( unbracketed ) numbers for @xmath89 in table@xmath29[numbers ] have begun to be probed by bounds inferred from the latest higgs measurements .",
    "according to several analyses  @xcite , the current data imply that the branching ratio of nonstandard decays of the higgs into invisible or undetected final - states can be as high as 22% at 95%cl if the higgs production mechanism is  sm - like , which is the situation in the scotogenic model .",
    "these limits are not yet very strict and , as the bracketed @xmath89 numbers indicate , can be easily evaded by changing  @xmath97 , which still has a  wide range of viability .",
    "therefore , the availability of other decay modes which may provide complementary constraints would be highly desirable .",
    "the impact of the new particles in the model can also be generated through loop diagrams .- boson decays into neutrinos ( charged leptons ) via one - loop diagrams with internal @xmath25 or @xmath26 @xmath98 and @xmath6 . at tree level",
    ", the @xmath34 boson can also decay into three - body final states containing them , similarly to the three - body higgs decays above .",
    "we have checked that these scotogenic effects on the @xmath34 decay are not significant .",
    "] of great interest are their contributions to standard decay channels of the higgs that are already under investigation at the lhc . here",
    "we look at @xmath99 and @xmath100 which arise in the sm mainly from top - quark- and @xmath101-boson - loop diagrams and also receive one - loop contributions from  @xmath27 .",
    "these transitions are the same as those in the inert doublet model  @xcite .",
    "based on general results in the literature  @xcite , the predicted rates of these modes are @xmath102 @xmath103 where the expressions for the form factors @xmath104 are available from  ref.@xcite , the @xmath105 terms originate exclusively from the @xmath27 contributions , @xmath106 , and  @xmath107 .",
    "it is worth noting that in the @xmath108 limit the amplitude for @xmath100 would reduce to that for @xmath99 modulo the different @xmath109 and @xmath34 couplings to fermions , @xmath101 bosons , and  @xmath27 .    in table@xmath29[numbers",
    "] we have also listed the resulting numbers for the ratio @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the sm rate , without the @xmath112 part .",
    "the examples in this table demonstrate that the scotogenic effects on @xmath113 and @xmath114 have a positive correlation . comparing the @xmath89 and @xmath115 numbers",
    ", we see that the latter have the milder dependence on  @xmath97 , unless @xmath116 changes signs .",
    "moreover , there does not appear to be a clear correlation between @xmath89 and the impact of @xmath27 on  @xmath117 , which is partly due to the fact that the yukawa parameters @xmath83 which are present in @xmath118 do not contribute to @xmath117 .",
    "since @xmath99 has been detected , unlike the @xmath2 mode  @xcite , we can already compare our examples with the data .",
    "the latest measurement of the signal strength for @xmath99 performed by the atlas collaboration is  @xmath119  @xcite . on the other hand , for the same mode",
    "the cms collaboration has found @xmath120 and @xmath121 using two different methods  @xcite .",
    "while awaiting an experimental consensus on this decay channel , we can say that all of the @xmath122 numbers in table@xmath29[numbers ] are still compatible with one or more of these lhc results , but the situation will likely change when more data become available . we may also expect that supplementary information will be supplied by future observations of  @xmath100 .",
    "we have seen that there are some decay modes of the higgs boson that can be employed to test the scotogenic model in complementary ways . at this point",
    "the restrictions inferred from the existing data on the higgs decays are not yet strong , but already start to probe the parameter space allowed by other data . in addition , with the fairly large yukawa couplings which we have obtained and the relatively light charged scalars , direct searches at the lhc may offer extra tests  @xcite on the scenario treated here .",
    "we have explored for the scotogenic model of radiative neutrino mass some implications of the recent discovery of a higgs boson at the lhc and experimental determination of @xmath0 that is not very small . employing a two - parameter neutrino - mixing matrix which is consistent with the latest neutrino - oscillation data within one sigma",
    ", we derive solutions for the yukawa couplings of the nonstandard particles in the model , which consist of scalars and fermions .",
    "such solutions are also applicable to some other models of radiative neutrino mass .",
    "we select one of the new fermions to be the lightest of the nonstandard particles which plays the role of cold  dm .",
    "subsequently , taking into account various constraints , including those from low - energy measurements and the observed relic density , we use the solutions for the yukawa couplings to consider higgs decays into final states containing the new particles .",
    "we find that within the allowed parameter regions the rates of such decays can be significant , which can already be probed with the latest higgs measurements .",
    "we also examine how these exotic decay channels may correlate with the scotogenic effects on the higgs decays into @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are under intensive study at the lhc .",
    "consequently , upcoming higgs data with improved precision from the lhc , or a future higgs factory , can be expected to reveal hints of the new particles or impose further restrictions on the model .",
    "we would like to thank c.q .",
    "geng , x.g .",
    "he , and m. kohda for helpful discussions . this work was supported in part by ncts .",
    "one can solve the diagonalization conditions in eq.([diagcond ] ) exactly for the three pairs of yukawa couplings @xmath124 , @xmath63 , in terms of @xmath125 . there is more than one set of the solutions . in each set",
    ", we can express the pairs as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 , or @xmath128 and @xmath129 since two or all three of the pairs may share the same  @xmath130 , such as in eq.([332 ] ) , there are altogether 27 sets of the solutions to  eq.([diagcond ] ) .",
    "not all of them can lead to at least two nonzero masses among the eigenvalues in  eq.([numass ] ) .",
    "three of the sets can each only yield one nonzero mass , whereas 18 ( six ) of the others can lead to two ( three ) nonzero masses .",
    "the majorana nature of @xmath131 implies that the process @xmath132 arises from @xmath133-mediated @xmath134- and @xmath135-channel diagrams .",
    "we find the absolute square of its amplitude , averaged ( summed ) over initial ( final ) spins , to be @xmath136 where @xmath137 in the case of @xmath138 , proceeding from @xmath139-mediated @xmath134- and @xmath135-channel diagrams , we need to take into account the majorana nature of the final neutrinos as well .",

    "<S> the recent observation of a higgs boson at the lhc and experimental confirmation of the nonvanishing neutrino - mixing parameter @xmath0 offer important means to test physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we explore this within the context of the scotogenic model , in which neutrinos acquire mass radiatively via one - loop interactions with dark matter . starting with a two - parameter neutrino - mixing matrix which is consistent with the latest neutrino - oscillation data at the one - sigma level , </S>",
    "<S> we derive different sets of solutions for the yukawa couplings of the nonstandard particles in the model and use the results to consider the higgs decays into final states involving the new particles . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the lightest one of them serves as fermionic cold dark matter , we show that such decays are allowed by various experimental and theoretical constraints to have substantial rates that are already restricted by the current lhc data . </S>",
    "<S> we also look at their correlations with the higgs decays into @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> upcoming lhc measurements of the higgs boson can therefore either detect scotogenic signals or place further constraints on the model . </S>"
