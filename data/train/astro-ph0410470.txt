    "we are now confident that our universe contains a large amount of cold dark matter .",
    "the most popular particle candidates for dark matter are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "these particles are being searched for directly and indirectly by dozens of experimental groups throughout the world .",
    "if we are fortunate , wimps may soon be discovered experimentally .",
    "+ although the discovery of wimps in the galactic halo would have enormous implications for our understanding of elementary particle physics , it implies very little about our understanding of dark matter . it",
    "it not reasonable to assume that the particle discovered represents all of the dark matter .",
    "this issue was first raised technically , though not resolved , in @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is easy to give examples where particles discovered in future and current experiments consist of less than @xmath0 of the total dark matter .",
    "+ even if weakly interacting massive particles are produced at colliders , it is still very important to directly determine their local density in the galactic halo .",
    "this can only be done with experimental data . during this",
    "talk , i will describe how this can be determined in the context of supersymmetry where the dark matter is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "similar analyses could be done for any dark matter candidate . +",
    "this talk is organized as follows .",
    "first , i will illustrate why a discovery of dark matter particles in the halo is insufficient to address the dark matter problem and describe some of the uncertainties of relating the local and relic densities of dark matter .",
    "i will then describe how dark matter is detected directly in experiments and offer the general form of the interaction rate .",
    "this will show what is required to determine the local density of wimps .",
    "i will give a very useful way to improve these expressions using data from different detector materials and at different recoil energies .",
    "+ in order to deduce the local density of wimps , it is essential to know the wimp s mass .",
    "i will present two methods to determine the mass of a wimp using direct detection data alone .",
    "the first reviews a well known relationship and the second presents preliminary results of the author .",
    "all of this work is then combined in the framework of the most general minimally supersymmetric standard model where the neutralino is the wimp seen in dark matter experiments .",
    "a general procedure is presented to estimate the local density and explicit bounds are given .",
    "let us imagine that a weakly interacting massive particle @xmath1 has been unambiguously observed in direct detection experiments .",
    "such a discovery would be an enormous triumph of theoretical and experimental particle cosmology , have deep implications for our understanding of the universe , may herald the existence of supersymmetry , and will account for ( at least ) some of the dark matter in the universe . however , a discovery of dark matter particles is far from a solution to the dark matter problem : there is no reason to suspect that @xmath1 is _ all _ the dark matter .",
    "+ what fraction of dark matter is represented by @xmath1 is a question that can not be answered by experiment alone or theory alone .",
    "furthermore , the answer will crucially depend on dark matter detection experiments .",
    "it is the purpose of this talk to describe how this question may be answered . + it should be possible to determine the local density of @xmath1 using direct detection experiments",
    "this is because , in a rough sense , they measure the local wimp density times its scattering cross section .",
    "unfortunately , there are very few constraints on the scattering cross sections of most wimp candidates .",
    "+ however , it is not true that the signal rate depends on the cross section and density independently because these are somewhat related .",
    "this is because the relic density @xmath2 is related to thermal production and freeze - out in the early universe .",
    "the rate of wimp - annihilation affects the relic density and depends on the wimp annihilation cross section , which in is turn somewhat related to the scattering cross section by crossing .",
    "+ therefore , there is less freedom in the observed signal rate than one may have navely suspected .",
    "this can be illustrated qualitatively as follows .",
    "if the cross section is large , then most wimps would have annihilated in the early universe and local density would be small . alternatively ,",
    "if the cross section is small , then thermal freeze - out would have occurred very early and the density would be higher .",
    "in either case , the cross section and density tend to compensate each other .",
    "+ the crude arguments above suggest that even a very small component of dark matter may be detectable because it may have a higher cross section .",
    "this has been referred to as the ` no - lose theorem ' in recent conferences .",
    "indeed , experimentalists may not lose out on discovering even a tiny fraction of the dark matter @xcite .",
    "+ this is seen in many realistic dark matter scenarios . in figure",
    "[ direct_detection ] , we have plotted the relic density against direct detection signal for some six thousand randomly generated , constrained minimally supersymmetric standard models ( without assuming any specific supersymmetry breaking scenario ) . by constrained , we mean that all of the models are allowed under current experimental constraints on supersymmetry .",
    "these models were generated and analyzed using the darksusy code @xcite .",
    "+     cpd / kg@xmath3kev . ]    notice that for any particular signal strength , the relic density fluctuates over at least two orders of magnitude . in accordance with the",
    "` no - lose theorem , ' experiments in the near future may detect even @xmath0 of the dark matter or less .",
    "+ however , the no - lose theorem unfortunately also implies that the discovery of wimps in the galactic halo tells us very little about how much of the dark matter they compose .",
    "a wimp discovery could easily represent a negligible fraction of the dark matter .",
    "+ therefore , although wimps may be discovered in the near future , the dark matter problem will not be addressed until the density of wimps has been directly determined .",
    "from studies of the cosmic microwave background , large scale structure formation , and big bang nucleosynthesis , we know the cosmic - scale relic density of cold dark matter to be approximately @xmath4 @xcite . from our knowledge of the rotation of the milky way galaxy , the local dark matter halo density is known to be approximately @xmath5 gev/@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that any dark matter experiment on earth is only sensitive to the local density and not the relic density .",
    "+ unfortunately , the relationship between the local and relic densities involves many details of galaxy formation and structure that are still not understood .",
    "even if we were able to demonstrate that @xmath1 has a local density of precisely @xmath7 gev/@xmath6 , there remain important subtleties about our understanding of the dark matter in the universe as a whole .",
    "+ noting these subtleties , however , it is extremely important to determine the local density of any wimp discovered in direct detection experiments .",
    "it would be very promising if the entire local dark matter halo could be accounted for by wimps discovered in these experiments .",
    "+ because direct detection experiments are sensitive to small - scale structure in the local halo density , a knowledge of the ambient halo density , @xmath5 gev/@xmath6 may not be sufficient .",
    "our knowledge of the local halo density is based on large scale surveys of star velocities in the milky way , and these measurements are not very sensitive to small - scale structure in the halo .",
    "+ there are several types of small - scale halo structure which may effect direct detection experiments .",
    "for example , the earth may be within a stream of dark matter .",
    "this situation has been suggested by studies of the sgr a stream and it has been estimated that our local halo density could be @xmath8 higher than the ambient density @xcite .",
    "alternatively , some authors have proposed that the halo may be clumpy or contain caustic structures @xcite .",
    "these small - scale perturbations in the dark matter density could have significant effects on direct detection rates .",
    "+ most of the small - scale structure considered in the literature involves local , high - density regions of dark matter within the halo .",
    "although these structures may make it easier to discover dark matter , they make it nearly impossible to assess what fraction of the halo is composed of @xmath1 .",
    "+ fortunately , there exist ways to check the smoothness of the halo profile .",
    "for example , dark matter streams or caustics may be identified or excluded using directional dark matter experiments like drift @xcite .",
    "also , a clumpy dark matter halo may possibly be identified by studying the time - dependence of a wimp signal .",
    "therefore , these questions may find answers in the foreseeable future .",
    "+ these ambiguities will need to be addressed before the dark matter problem has been put to rest .",
    "however , for the purposes of this talk , we will assume that the halo is locally smooth and that if @xmath9 gev/@xmath6 , then @xmath1 is all of the dark matter .",
    "dark matter particles in the halo can be observed directly through their interaction with ordinary matter . although wimps interact only weakly , they will occasionally scatter off matter in detectors , depositing a small amount of energy .",
    "because wimps typically have masses on the order of a hundred gev and move relatively slowly in the halo , on the order of a few hundred km / s , they typically deposit recoil energies from @xmath10 kev . using very sensitive detectors , experiments can observe signals as low as a few kev .",
    "using sophisticated coincidence algorithms , most experiments can remove virtually all background noise except scattering from neutrons . +",
    "direct detection experiments essentially measure the @xmath1-nucleus scattering rate as a function of recoil energy and time . in general , the signal rate is a function of the cross section for @xmath1-nucleon scattering , the nuclear physics describing the nuclei in a particular detector , and the local velocity profile of the wimp fraction of the dark matter halo .      it will be helpful for us to state the explicit form of the differential interaction rate for a particular detector at the recoil energy @xmath11 .",
    "let the detector in question be composed of nuclei labeled by the index @xmath12 , each with mass fraction @xmath13 .",
    "then , the differential rate of wimp scattering at recoil energy @xmath11 is ,    @xmath14 ^ 2+\\frac{4\\pi}{(2j_j+1)}\\left[a_1 ^ 2s_{j_{00}}(q)+a_0 ^ 2s_{j_{11}}(q)+a_1a_0s_{j_{01}}(q)\\right]\\right\\},\\label{rate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the minimum velocity kinematically capable of depositing energy @xmath11 into the @xmath16 nucleus , @xmath17 is the local velocity distribution function for the galactic halo , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are nuclear form factors for coherent and incoherent scattering , respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are atomic and mass numbers , @xmath22 is the nuclear spin , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the constant parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 describe the coherent and incoherent wimp - nucleon scattering cross sections , respectively . for a more detailed discussion of equation [ rate ] , please refer to any modern review of dark matter ( see ,",
    "_ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "+ it is important to note that equation [ rate ] depends on several unknown parameters :    1 .",
    "the wimp s mass , @xmath27 , 2 .",
    "the particle physics of @xmath1 which determines the interaction parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , 3 .   the velocity distribution of the halo , @xmath17 , 4 .   the local density of wimps , @xmath28",
    "these details will not be known when wimps are first discovered and may take many years to resolve .      from the discussion above , it is clear that to determine the density @xmath28 , one must first    1 .",
    "identify the particle @xmath1 ; 2 .   determine @xmath27 ; 3 .",
    "estimate the halo profile ; 4 .",
    "calculate the interaction parameters from the theory describing @xmath1 .",
    "each of these will require enormous efforts from both dark matter and collider physics experiments .",
    "+ the most important and perhaps most difficult requirement is the identification of @xmath1 .",
    "this is not possible from dark matter experiments alone .",
    "this is because these experiments observe only a few of @xmath1 s quantum numbers .",
    "for example , it is unlikely that any amount of direct detection data can be used to differentiate between the lightest supersymmetric particle and the lightest kaluza - klein particle ; if possible at all , this would probably require very precise data from several different nuclei .",
    "therefore , although direct detection experiments may unequivocally discover dark matter wimps , they can not explain the dark matter alone .",
    "+ perhaps the most important parameter describing @xmath1 is its mass .",
    "this determines all of its kinematics and is crucially linked to the local density .",
    "fortunately , @xmath27 may be calculable from direct detection experiments alone .",
    "the known methods of calculating @xmath27 from dark matter experiments are described below .",
    "+ because the mass may be observable , it may prove the key to the identification of @xmath1 .",
    "if a neutral , stable , particle is observed at colliders with the same mass as that observed in dark matter experiments , then we could suspect that they are the same particle .",
    "although this association is imprecise , it appears to be one of the best methods of identification .",
    "+ we should note , however , that determining the mass of @xmath1 may be very difficult at hadron colliders .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 is the lsp , it could take several years and an enormous effort to determine @xmath27 in a model - independent way .",
    "most of the known techniques for determining the mass of the lsp rely on the framework of msugra or a specific assumptions about the relative masses of squarks and sleptons .",
    "therefore , it should be stressed that @xmath1 may not be identified until long after it is discovered .",
    "+ also , the halo profile must be known sufficiently well . as described above , any small - scale structure in the halo",
    "will dramatically alter the analysis of the local density .",

    ", one must know a great deal about the theory which describes @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear that these parameters can not be obtained from direct detection data alone : they rely on many parameters of whatever extended standard model @xmath1 is a part of . for example , if @xmath1 is the lsp , then these parameters will be functions of the squark masses , mixing angles , gauge - content of the lsp , and higgs parameters .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that all of these will be known when @xmath1 is discovered in direct detection experiments .",

    "( varying the nuclear form factors and minimum velocities ) ,    one can invert equation [ rate2 ] to solve for @xmath30 and @xmath31 if the halo velocity distribution and @xmath27 were known .",
    "that is , given a halo model and wimp mass , one use find sufficient data from different detector materials and different recoil energies to determine @xmath32 and @xmath31 ( up to quadratic ambiguities ) .",
    "+ we should mention that there are many important situations in which the above analysis can be simplified .",
    "for example , because @xmath26 are already scaled by linearly independent combinations of the incoherent nuclear form factors , @xmath19 , it is not necessary to use different detector materials to solve for @xmath31 .",
    "however , this will only work if there is data available from a detector with nuclei having non - zero spin which is sufficiently sensitive to incoherent scattering . +",
    "although knowing the scaled interaction parameters will not directly determine the local density , it can give enormous insight into the particle physics of @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 is the lsp , then the ratios @xmath33 or @xmath34 could possibly lead to important insights on @xmath35 , the degeneracy of the squark masses , mixing , and perhaps contain other information as well . this could be very important for collider physics and disentangling the mssm .",
    "of all the factors required to interpret the observed signal rate , perhaps the most important is @xmath27 . not only is the mass required to compute the density , but it also plays a critical role in the identification of @xmath1 as described above .",
    "fortunately , it may be possible to determine @xmath27 from direct detection experiments alone . + there are roughly two ways to determine @xmath27 from direct detection data .",
    "one method , that using the annual modulation crossing energy , was described in the dark matter review article by primack _",
    "al . _ in 1988 @xcite .",
    "although it seems unlikely to have originated in a review article , we have been unable to find any previous author mentioning this effect .",
    "the other method has been developed by the author in collaboration with gordon kane and represents work still in preparation .",
    "both of these methods rely only on the kinematics of the halo , although neither are particularly sensitive to the precise halo model ( although , see caveats in @xcite ) .",
    "as the earth orbits the sun , its velocity through the galactic dark matter halo varies between roughly @xmath36 and @xmath37 km / s @xcite .",
    "this in turn causes annual modulation in the scattering rate .",
    "however , the amplitude of this modulation varies as a function of recoil energy and changes sign . for a more detailed description ,",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "+     gev . ]    in figure [ annual_modulation ] , we plot the difference between scattering rate in june and december as a function of recoil energy for several detector materials .",
    "notice that there is a particular energy , called the ` crossing energy , ' at which no annual modulation is observed . as pointed out by primack _",
    "@xcite , the crossing energy is an explicit function of the masses of the wimp and detector nuclei which can be derived easily from kinematics .",
    "therefore , if crossing is observed , one can determine the mass of the wimp explicitly . +",
    "this method is moderately robust .",
    "specifically , if there is an energy at which the annual modulation amplitude changes sign , then one can confidently determine the wimp mass to within approximately @xmath38 .",
    "however there are some important subtleties and caveats to this analysis described in , for example , @xcite .",
    "these include the effects of bin - sizes and small - scale halo structure .",
    "furthermore , if the wimp is very light , then the the crossing energy may be well below the threshold of the detector and therefore not observed at all .      recall that if the halo velocity profile and @xmath27 are known , then direct detection data from different detector materials and different energies can be used to solve for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "if the halo velocity distribution is known , then only the wimp mass is required to determine these .",
    "+ let us assume that the local halo velocity profile can be adequately approximated and that there exists enough data to solve for @xmath30 and @xmath31 if the mass were known .",
    "( if , for example , there is only data sufficient to solve for @xmath26 , it will be clear how to proceed along similar lines ) .",
    "because many direct detection experiments observe scattering rates in a large number of recoil energy bins , we can generally expect to have many more measurements than the minimum required to solve the system of equations .",
    "+ because the interaction parameters are absolute constants , all minimal , linearly independent combination of measurements used to solve for the scaled interaction parameters will agree if the correct mass were used in the derivation .",
    "however , if an an arbitrary @xmath39 were used to solve for these parameters , different calculations will not in general agree .",
    "+ this motivates us to define a ` kinematical consistency ' function , @xmath40 , which compares the values of @xmath30,@xmath31 obtained using different independent subsets of the data as a function of @xmath39 used .",

    "specifically , we have not found any way to demonstrate that @xmath27 is the unique root of @xmath40 , although we have found no example where it has multiple roots .",
    "+ to determine the wimp mass , one varies @xmath39 until @xmath43 . to test how useful this technique is ,",
    "we applied it to some six thousand random , constrained mssms . in",
    "every single model tested , the correct mass was determined to near - arbitrary precision . figure [ mass_scan ] illustrates a typical plot of @xmath40 .",
    "notice that @xmath45 has an extremely sharp minimum , decreasing many orders of magnitude within a few gev of the true mass of the lsp .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that experimental uncertainties and resolutions were not considered for these calculations . +     where the wimp corresponds to the neutralino in the mssm specified by atlas susy point 2 @xcite .",
    "the models and data were generated within the framework of the darksusy package , @xcite . ]",
    "although this method appears quite promising , these results should be considered preliminary .",
    "several questions still remain regarding how robust this calculation is after the introduction of experimental uncertainties and halo model ambiguities . without these uncertainties ,",
    "the algorithm yields the correct mass to seemingly arbitrary precision .",
    "it will be interesting to see how this changes in more realistic circumstances .",
    "because @xmath27 can be determined in principle using the methods described above and we are working under the assumption that the local halo velocity profile can be adequately approximated , we can determine @xmath30 and/or @xmath31 independent of the identification of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , to determine @xmath28 it is sufficient to know any one of the interaction parameters .",

    "it is obvious that if a particular supersymmetry breaking scenario were assumed , the above expressions would be enormously simplified .",
    "however , these types of assumptions are very difficult to justify ( theoretically or experimentally ) and therefore greatly limit the generality of the work .",
    "+ it is important to note the flexibility of the derivation involved to compute these bounds .",
    "if , for example , the masses of several light squarks were known , one can greatly improve the above bounds by including these in the explicit expression for @xmath73 and then maximizing it relative to the parameters that remain unknown . in this manner almost any additional knowledge can be added to arrive at stronger statements .",
    "therefore , not only do these bounds grow more restrictive with increasing knowledge of the mssm , but they continue to approach a realistic estimate of the interaction parameters .      from the work above ,",
    "it is clear that given adequate bounds on @xmath35 and a lower bound on the lightest squark mass , there exist strong , model - independent upper bounds on @xmath26 .",
    "these in turn can be used to place a very strong lower bound on the neutralino relic density because we know @xmath31 .",
    "+ to test this method , we considered some six thousand randomly generated mssms that are consistent with all known bounds on supersymmetry . for each of these models , we calculated the interaction rates for a nai detector in twelve recoil energy bins .",
    "this ( idealized ) data was used to compute the mass of the lsp , using the kinematical consistency function , and to solve for @xmath31 .",
    "upper bounds were calculated for @xmath26 assuming @xmath38 uncertainty in @xmath35 and a lower bound on the lowest squark mass of either @xmath74 gev or the actual mass of the lightest squark , whichever is less .",
    "the specific gauge content of the neutralino was taken to be known for each model , however , for the sake of computational simplicity . using the upper bounds for @xmath26",
    ", we obtained a lower bound on the local density @xmath28 .",
    "+     to the true local density for each model .",
    "the red line indicates perfect agreement .",
    "notice that the procedure correctly determined a lower bound for the local density for every model . ]",
    "figure [ density_bound ] illustrates the results of using this algorithm for each of the randomly generated mssms .",
    "notice that the estimated local density is always strictly less than the true local density  as required by it being a lower bound .",
    "also notice that for many models the lower bound was not such a poor estimate .",
    "this will be the case , for example , when the lightest squark mass is near or below the @xmath74 gev bound .",
    "we have seen that , by itself , a discovery of dark matter particles in our galactic halo can not address the dark matter problem of the universe .",
    "however , combined with data from colliders to identify the particle and limit its interaction parameters , we can generally estimate its local density .",
    "+ in the framework of supersymmetry , we have shown a robust and iteratively improvable method to estimate the local density of a neutralino lsp observed in direct detection experiments using any information available about the mssm .",
    "+ therefore , although the dark matter problem may not be solved immediately when wimps are observed , there are clear and general ways to address their cosmological significance .",
    "+ * acknowledgements * + this research was done in collaboration with gordon kane of the university of michigan and was supported by the michigan center for theoretical physics and the national science foundation s 2004 reu program .",
