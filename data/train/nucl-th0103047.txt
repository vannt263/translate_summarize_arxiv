    "a survey of the molecule - like structure is one of the most challenging subjects in light neutron - rich nuclei . in",
    "be isotopes , recently , decay into fragments of he isotopes ( @xmath11he , @xmath12he , @xmath13he ) has been observed from the excited states of @xmath14be@xcite and @xmath15be@xcite , and the presence of a two - center configuration is suggested . from the theoretical side ,",
    "these states are studied by various models by which the molecular - orbital nature of the weakly bound neutrons around the two @xmath0-clusters has been revealed @xcite .    as for multi - cluster configurations in light @xmath0-nuclei beyond the two - center systems , the existence of @xmath16 states has been predicted around the threshold energy in the so - called ikeda diagram @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that the second @xmath17 state of @xmath15c has a 3@xmath0-like molecular configuration@xcite .",
    "however , according to many theoretical analyses@xcite , the state is not necessary to have a linear - chain of 3@xmath0 , but is described as a weak - coupling state with a triangular shape or the @xmath13be+@xmath0 configuration .",
    "furthermore , a rotational band of @xmath6o with a very large moment of inertia has been observed around the 4@xmath0 threshold energy region@xcite , and the 4@xmath0 linear - chain have been discussed @xcite .",
    "however , the 4@xmath0-chain has not been experimentally confirmed yet .",
    "recently , the discussions of the well - developed cluster structure are extended to the neutron - rich nuclei , and the role of valence neutrons which stabilize the linear - chain structure has been pointed out .",
    "for example , von oertzen has extended his analyses for the molecular structure in be isotopes @xcite to c isotopes , and the linear - chain state consisting of 3@xmath0 and valence neurons around it has been speculated .",
    "even if the 3@xmath0-system without valence neutrons ( @xmath15c ) does not have a linear - chain structure , the valence neutrons around it are expected to increase the binding energy and stabilize the linear - chain state .    in this paper ,",
    "the molecular - orbital approach introduced for the be isotopes is applied to a study of c isotopes ( a=12 , 14 , 16 ) .",
    "the appearance of prolonged structure with the @xmath0-@xmath0 core in @xmath14be@xcite and @xmath15be@xcite has been successfully described by the @xmath0+@xmath0+n+n+@xmath18 model , where the orbits for the valence neutrons are classified based on the molecular - orbit ( mo ) model@xcite . in the present study",
    ", mo is extended to c isotopes , we focus on the stabilization of the linear - chain structure with the 3@xmath0-core to which valence neutrons are added .",
    "the total wave function of a microscopic @xmath0+@xmath0+@xmath0+@xmath1+@xmath19 model is fully antisymmetrized and expressed by a superposition of basis states centered to different relative distances between the @xmath0-clusters ( @xmath20 ) with various configurations of the valence neutrons ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xmath18 ) around the @xmath0-clusters : @xmath23.\\ ] ] the projection to the eigen - states of angular momentum @xmath24 is performed numerically . each @xmath0 cluster consisting of four nucleons",
    "is described by gaussians ( @xmath25 ) centered at @xmath26 and spin - isospin wave function@xmath27 : @xmath28 @xmath29 , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\nu=1/2\\beta^2,\\ ] ] where , the oscillator parameter @xmath30 is equal to 1.46 fm . for the linear - chain state ,",
    "the values of @xmath31 are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 on the @xmath35-axis . each valence neutron ( @xmath36 ) around the @xmath0-@xmath0-@xmath0 core",
    "is expressed by a linear combination of local gaussians : @xmath37    these valence - neutron orbits are classified according to the mo picture@xcite .",
    "the orbit of the valence neutron perpendicular to the @xmath35-axis of the 3@xmath0 linear - chain core is called @xmath3-orbit , and one along the @xmath35-axis is called @xmath4-orbit . the antisymmetrization imposes the forbidden space for the valence neutrons ; the @xmath3-orbit must have at least one node perpendicular to the @xmath35-axis , and the @xmath4-orbit must have at least three nodes since three @xmath0-clusters along the @xmath35-axis already occupy the orbitals with @xmath38 .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath3- and the @xmath4-orbit are schematically drawn in fig .",
    "1 . in the present framework ,",
    "each valence - neutron orbit is introduced to have a definite @xmath39 value at the zero limit of centers of local gaussians @xmath40 describing the spatial distribution of the orbit .",
    "the precise positions of @xmath41 are determined variationally before the angular - momentum projection .",
    "since the values of @xmath41 are optimized to be finite , the orbits are not exactly the eigen - state of @xmath39 , and are labeled as @xmath42 . for the @xmath3-orbit with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , the spatial part and the spin part of @xmath45",
    "are defined to be parallel ( @xmath46 ) , for which the spin - orbit interaction acts attractively . at the same time , @xmath44 is described as a linear combination of two orbits centered at right- and left - hand side of the system based on the mo picture .",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48 here , @xmath49 denotes the @xmath50-orbit centered at @xmath51 on the @xmath35-axis , and these variational parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 are optimized by using the cooling method in antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite for each basis state .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath54 orbit where the spin - orbit interaction acts repulsively can also be defined by changing the spin - direction of @xmath44 , where the spatial part and the spin part of @xmath45 are anti - parallel ( @xmath55 ) : @xmath56 the distribution of the @xmath4-orbit is just along the 3@xmath0 axis , then it is introduced to have three nodes .",
    "@xmath57 is represented as a linear combination of three orbits with @xmath58 , whose centers are @xmath59 , @xmath33 , and @xmath60 on the @xmath35-axis .",
    "@xmath61 @xmath62 these three orbits ( @xmath63 , @xmath54 and @xmath57 ) are the basic building blocks for the molecular - orbital structure . also , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 orbits are introduced by taking the time reversal of @xmath44 , @xmath54 , and @xmath57 orbits , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian and the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction are the same as in refs.@xcite , and parameters of volkov no.2@xcite for the central part and the g3rs spin - orbit term@xcite for the spin - orbit part are determined from the @xmath67 and @xmath68 scattering phase shifts , and the binding energy of deuteron is also reproduced with these parameters .",
    "in the following part , we show the calculated results for the stability of the linear - chain state for various configurations .",
    "the isotopes and configurations which we take into account are @xmath15c , @xmath5c@xmath69 ( two @xmath1 s in the @xmath3-orbits ) , @xmath5c@xmath70 ( two @xmath1 s in the @xmath4-orbits ) , @xmath6c((@xmath71 ( four @xmath1 s in the @xmath3-orbits ) and @xmath6c((@xmath72 ( two @xmath1 s in the @xmath3-orbits and two @xmath1 s in the @xmath4-orbits ) . as schematically shown in fig . 2 ,",
    "two variational paths are introduced corresponding to the breathing - like ( fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ) and the bending - like ( fig .",
    "2 ( b ) ) degrees of freedom . the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath73 stand for the @xmath0-@xmath0 distance and the bending angle of the 3@xmath0-core , respectively .",
    "firstly , we show the @xmath17 energy curves for the linear - chain structure against the breathing - path in fig .",
    "it is found that the energy pocket around @xmath74 fm becomes deeper as the increase of number of valence neutrons in the @xmath3-orbit ( @xmath15c @xmath75 @xmath5c@xmath69 @xmath75 @xmath6c((@xmath71 ) . using our framework ,",
    "the binding energy of one @xmath0-cluster is calculated to be 27.5 mev , then the @xmath0+@xmath0+@xmath0 + @xmath1-neutrons threshold energy is @xmath76 mev .",
    "the 3@xmath0-system ( @xmath15c ) has minimal energy around @xmath77 fm , however , this is too shallow to conclude the stability of the linear - chain state . on the contrary , in @xmath5c@xmath69",
    ", there appears evident minimal energy around @xmath74 fm .",
    "the energy ( @xmath78 mev ) is lower than @xmath15c by 11 mev and the energy pocket is much deeper .",
    "this energy corresponds to the excitation energy of 18 mev from the ground state calculated with an equilateral - triangle configuration for the 3@xmath0-core , which is @xmath79 mev .",
    "the @xmath6c@xmath80 configurational state is most stable among states studied and has an energy pocket of @xmath81 mev , where the @xmath0-@xmath0 distance is @xmath82 fm , shorter than those for @xmath15c and @xmath5c@xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3-orbit is found to stabilize the linear - chain structure as the increase of valence neutrons ( @xmath15c @xmath75 @xmath5c@xmath69 @xmath75 @xmath6c((@xmath71 ) .",
    "next , we discuss the case where the valence neutrons occupy the @xmath4-orbit .",
    "@xmath5c@xmath70 has an excitation energy higher by about 14 mev in comparison with @xmath5c@xmath69 .",
    "it is rather surprising that the difference is only 14 mev in spite of the fact that @xmath83 has only one node and @xmath84 has three nodes .",
    "this is because the @xmath4-orbit is along the @xmath0-@xmath0-@xmath0 core : the higher nodal orbits along the symmetry axis become low - lying as a result of the clustering of the core .",
    "the @xmath4-orbit enhances the prolonged shape of the 3@xmath0-core , and the optimal @xmath20-value is @xmath853.5 fm .",
    "however , the @xmath5c@xmath70 case has no deep pocket enough to be stabilized against the breathing - like path .",
    "when two more valence neutrons occupy the @xmath3-orbit , although this minimal energy is higher by 5 mev than that of @xmath6c@xmath80 , @xmath6c@xmath86 has the minimal @xmath17 energy of @xmath87 mev .",
    "the calculated energy pocket is deep enough to guarantee the stability for the breathing - like path .",
    "therefore , it is summarized that the linear - chain structure can not be stabilized against the breathing - like mode with the @xmath4-orbit only in @xmath5c@xmath88 , however , the neutrons in @xmath3-orbits increase the binding energy and prevent the break - up of the system in @xmath5c@xmath89 , @xmath6c@xmath80 , and @xmath6c@xmath86 .    finally , the stability of these linear - chain states against the bending - like path is examined .",
    "the @xmath17 energy curves of @xmath15c , @xmath5c@xmath89 , @xmath5c@xmath88 , @xmath6c@xmath80 , and @xmath6c@xmath86 against the @xmath73-value are shown in fig .",
    "4 . except for the case of @xmath6c@xmath86 ,",
    "the curvature of these states is rather monotonic and the energy minimum does not clearly appear . in @xmath5c ,",
    "the orthogonality between the linear - chain configuration and low - lying states with equilateral - triangle configuration of 3@xmath0 is taken into account .",
    "this effect works but not sufficiently to push up the energy of the state with a finite bending angle .",
    "however , as clearly seen in fig .",
    "4 , the @xmath6c@xmath86 case shows a sharp increase of the @xmath17 energy as the increase of the bending angle and is found to be stable against the bending - like path .",
    "this feature is much different from @xmath15c , @xmath5c@xmath89 , @xmath5c@xmath88 , and @xmath6c@xmath80 cases . from the analysis above",
    ", the linear - chain configuration can be stabilized against the breathing - like path by neutrons in the @xmath3-orbit ( @xmath5c@xmath89 , @xmath6c@xmath80 , @xmath6c@xmath86 ) , but @xmath6c@xmath80 is only the case which is stable also against the bending - like path .",
    "we further discuss the reason for the sharp increase of the @xmath17 energy in @xmath6c@xmath86 against the bending - like path .",
    "the @xmath17 energy increases by 15.7 mev from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , in which the kinetic energy part is 10.3 mev . to understand the energy increase with the increase of bending angle @xmath73 of this case , we calculate and compare the overlap between the wave functions with @xmath90 and @xmath91 for various configurations in table i , where the results are shown . in @xmath15c , the wave functions with @xmath90 and @xmath91 have the squared overlap of 0.91 , and @xmath5c@xmath89 has almost the same value .",
    "@xmath5c@xmath92 has the value of 0.85 , smaller than @xmath5c@xmath89 by only 6 @xmath93 , and @xmath6c@xmath80 has almost the same value as the @xmath5c@xmath88 case .",
    "this result shows that the overlaps additionally decreases a little for the @xmath4-orbital neutrons , and also for the @xmath3-orbital neutrons as the increase of the valence neutrons . in spite of these , the overlap between @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath6c@xmath86 case shows a significantly large decrease to 0.60 .",
    "@xmath6c@xmath86 is only the configuration which shows drastic decrease of the overlap between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "as discussed in following part , it can be known that the drastic decrease as the increase of the bending angle is due to the increase of overlap between two neutrons in the @xmath3-orbit and two neutrons in the @xmath4- orbit . when there arises the overlap between them , the overlap component in the total wave function",
    "is diminished due to pauli exclusion principle , that is , so - called pauli blocking .",
    "therefore , the physical state can be expressed by the modified wave function which is made by subtracting the overlap component from the original wave function .",
    "since the energies of the @xmath3- and the @xmath4- orbits discussed here are relatively low , the modified wave function involves larger components of higher excitation energy in comparison with the wave function at @xmath94 free from the pauli blocking . as a result , the pauli blocking due to the increase of overlap between valence four neutrons",
    "is considered to bring the increase of energy proportional to the decrease of squared overlap .",
    "this is a possible explanation for rapid increase of the energy against the bending angle . on this view",
    "we can estimate the increase of the energy as follows .",
    "firstly , we compare the cases with pauli blocking and without pauli blocking .",
    "if there is no pauli blocking , the squared overlap of @xmath6c@xmath86 between @xmath90 and @xmath91 is estimated as follows : @xmath95 here , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are squared overlaps between @xmath90 and @xmath91 of @xmath5c@xmath89 , @xmath5c@xmath88 , and @xmath15c shown in table i. in the actual squared overlap of @xmath6c@xmath86 shown in table i , the pauli blocking effect is automatically included , and the value is @xmath99 .",
    "this difference corresponds to the component excited to higher shells because of the pauli blocking effect , and this is 25 @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath100    secondly , we estimate the increase of the kinetic energy when two valence neutrons in the @xmath3- or the @xmath4-orbits are excited to higher shells by 25 @xmath93 due to the pauli blocking effect .",
    "@xmath101 this value is consistent with the increase of the kinetic energy at @xmath91 mentioned above .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that this is one of the most important mechanisms which stabilizes the linear - chain state in @xmath6c .",
    "it is summarized that the linear - chain structure of @xmath6c@xmath86 with 3@xmath0 core is the only case to have the simultaneous stabilities for the breathing - like break up path and for the bending - like path among @xmath15c , @xmath5c , and @xmath6c .",
    "other configurations , such as @xmath5c@xmath89 and @xmath6c@xmath80 are stable against the breathing - like path but not stable against the bending - like path .",
    "a combination of the @xmath3- and the @xmath4- orbits occupied by four neutrons plays doubly important roles to make a deep energy pocket for breathing - like path and to prevent the bending - like free motion of the system .",
    "the @xmath6c@xmath86 configuration forms a rotational band with an energy slope of @xmath102 kev , and since the two - neutron separation - energy of @xmath6c is experimentally found to be @xmath103 mev , the band head energy is expected to corresponds to around 25 mev in excitation .",
    "we have shown in @xmath6c that the pauli - blocking effect among the valence neutrons play an important role for the stability of the linear - chain configuration .",
    "this effect is expected to be more important as the neutron number increases .",
    "we are interested in @xmath104c the appearance of similar linear - chain structure in low - lying region , where all of the three neutron orbits introduced here are occupied ( @xmath105 ) .    experimentally , the observation of the @xmath106-ray from high - spin states is the most probable way to confirm the presence of rotational band with large moment of inertia .",
    "although the present analysis has been restricted to the @xmath17 state , we will investigate also high - spin states , where it is expected that a glue - like role of valence neutrons becomes more important to prevent the breathing - like break - up of the system .    in the present analysis ,",
    "parameter @xmath20 has been fixed when the stability against the bending motion has been examined , and @xmath73 has been fixed to zero when the bending motion has been examined .",
    "however , to assure theoretically the stability of these linear - chain states , we intend to investigate the case when two degrees of freedom ( @xmath20 and @xmath73 ) simultaneously activate . this shall be examined by superposing states on the energy surface of @xmath20 and @xmath73 based on generator coordinate method .",
