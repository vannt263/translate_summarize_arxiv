    "numerous processes in single cells and tissues require the generation of mechanical force and directed motion .",
    "most of these processes are based on the activity of molecular motors interacting with the filaments of the cytoskeleton , that is , motors from the dynein- , kinesin- and myosin - families interacting with microtubule or actin filaments @xcite .",
    "examples include separation of chromosomes and closure of the constriction ring during cell division , intracellular transport of cargo vesicles and organelles , contraction of muscle cells , large - scale rearrangements in a developing tissue , and wound closure after tissue injury .",
    "the mechanical energy used in these processes is gained by hydrolysis of and drives a cycle of conformational changes in the allosteric motor molecules . over the last decades , the way single motor molecules work has been dissected in great quantitative detail @xcite .",
    "however , it remains a formidable challenge to understand how molecular motors work in the physiological context of cells and tissues , where they usually collaborate in groups @xcite .",
    "here we theoretically address one crucial aspect of this situation , namely force generation in small ensembles of non - processive motors .",
    "a large research effort has been focused on processive motors which stay attached to the substrate sufficiently long as to not loose contact for many motor cycles @xcite .",
    "for example , the two motor heads of conventional kinesin typically take more than @xmath0 steps of @xmath1 length before the motor unbinds from its microtubule track @xcite .",
    "although this property would enable processive motors to work alone , experimental evidence suggests that also processive motors in a physiological context often collaborate in small groups @xcite .",
    "the main benefit here is that attaching several motors to the same cargo increases the walk length dramatically @xcite and allows the cargo to pass over defects on the track and change reliably between tracks of finite length @xcite .",
    "furthermore , because the velocity of a processive motor typically decreases with the applied load , groups of motors sharing an external load are able to transport cargo at larger velocities or to exert larger forces on a cargo or an elastic element . as an example for the latter , it has been shown that the force necessary to pull membrane tubes from a lipid vesicle can only be produced by groups of processive motors @xcite .",
    "in contrast to processive motors , non - processive motors can not do useful work single - handedly and therefore necessarily have to operate in groups in order to generate persistent motion or appreciable levels of force .",
    "the paradigm for a non - processive motor acting in ensembles is in cross - striated skeletal muscle @xcite . in the muscle",
    "sarcomere , hundreds of motors are assembled in so - called thick filaments .",
    "the arrangement of in a thick filament is of bipolar order , that is , the motors in the two halves of a thick filament are oriented in opposing direction .",
    "the motors in either half of a thick filament walk as an ensemble on so - called thin filaments , actin filaments which are anchored in the two z - discs bounding the sarcomere .",
    "the arrangement of thick and thin filaments is symmetric with respect to the mid - plane of the sarcomere so that motor activity leads to muscle contraction .",
    "investigation of the structure of muscle has been facilitated by the remarkable precision of the spatial arrangement of motors in the sarcomere .",
    "for example , in frog skeletal muscle each half of a thick filament contains @xmath2 motors which are arranged at a very regular distance of @xmath3 @xcite .    even before had been biochemically characterized , the first theoretical description of muscle contraction was already based on the non - equilibrium binding and unbinding kinetics of myosin to actin which effectively rectified thermal fluctuations of an elastic element @xcite . in this early model ,",
    "myosin was described as an actin binding site fluctuating in a harmonic potential and binding preferentially ahead of and unbinding preferentially behind its equilibrium position , thus inducing a net force displacing the actin filament .",
    "precise measurements of contraction speed as function of force in combination with x - ray diffraction and detailed modeling allowed to identify the chemical and mechanical details of the hydrolysis cycle and led to the development of the crossbridge model @xcite , which provided a molecular mechanism for the principle of preferential binding and unbinding proposed by @xcite .",
    "those advances inspired theoretical models analyzing the statistical physics of large ensembles of motors simultaneously pulling on a single filament @xcite . with these models",
    "it has been shown that in order to describe the response of skeletal muscle to varying loading conditions it is essential that the unbinding rate of from actin is a decreasing function of the applied load .",
    "in contrast to , e.g. , the processive motor kinesin , this make a catch bond rather than a slip bond @xcite and leads to the recruitment of additional crossbridges under load .",
    "experimentally , this has been confirmed in a combination of mechanical and x - ray techniques @xcite .",
    "apart from muscle tissue , groups of molecular motors are also active in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton of non - muscle tissue cells like fibroblasts .",
    "increasing evidence shows that non - muscle motors acting in small groups play a crucial role in cell adhesion and migration , with dramatic implications for development , health and disease @xcite .",
    "for example , motors contribute to the retrograde flow of the actin cytoskeleton away from the leading edge during cell spreading and migration @xcite as well as to the maintenance of cortical tension underlying cell shape , movement and division @xcite .",
    "adherent tissue cells in culture tend to form contractile actin bundles called _ stress fibers _ which play an important role in force generation and mechanosensing @xcite .",
    "there exist several kinds of stress fibers and only some of them ( most notably ventral stress fibers ) bear some similarity with skeletal muscle in being characterized by a sarcomeric organization with alternating regions of the crosslinker @xmath4-actinin and @xcite .    while skeletal and cardiac muscle show a large degree of order , smooth muscle is characterized by far more disordered actin - myosin assemblies",
    "nevertheless , in all types of muscle , motors work in large groups .",
    "the organization of cytoskeletal actin and myosin structures is , in general , far more disordered and far more dynamic than the actin - myosin assemblies in all types of muscle tissue .",
    "most importantly , the number of motors in the ensembles is much smaller : non - muscle is usually organized in minifilaments with a bipolar structure similar to thick filaments but comprising only @xmath5-@xmath6 motors , as has been estimated from the size of minifilaments in electron micrographs @xcite .",
    "the exact numbers of motors in different actin modules will vary depending on the cellular conditions under which minifilaments are formed .",
    "recently , contractile actin bundles have been reconstituted _ in vitro _",
    "it was demonstrated that for sufficiently large concentration , minifilaments are able to contract parallel bundles as well as networks of actin filaments with random polarity . in these experiments , the number of molecules in the minifilaments depends on the type of and the preparation of the minifilaments and was estimated to range from @xmath7 for non - muscle @xcite to several @xmath0 for muscle . due to the small duty ratio of ( smooth ) muscle of @xmath8 @xcite compared to a duty ratio of @xmath9 for non - muscle @xcite , however , the number of attached to the substrate should be comparable for muscle and non - muscle minifilaments . for a minifilament with @xmath10 muscle molecules",
    ", the number of attached motors may well be as low as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "for the small number of motors in cytoskeletal minifilaments , stochastic effects are expected to become important and have indeed been observed in measurements of the tension generated by motors in reconstituted assays . in three bead assays ,",
    "an actin filament is held in two optical traps and attached to the surface of a third bead is allowed to bind to the actin filament . at elevated concentrations @xcite ,",
    "several are able to bind simultaneously and the displacement of the actin filament against the trap force is observed . in active gels , which are _ in vitro _ mixtures of actin filaments , actin crosslinkers and minifilaments , the fluctuating tension in the actin network induced by the activity of minifilaments is measured @xcite . in motility assays ,",
    "motors are distributed over a surface and the movement of an actin filament against an external force is followed @xcite .",
    "such reconstituted assays characteristically reveal noisy trajectories with a gradual build - up of tension followed by an abrupt release , which is likely due to the detachment of the whole ensemble of motors , allowing the actin filament to slip . however , a detailed and analytically tractable model for this important situation is still missing .    in order to interpret experimental data from cellular and",
    "reconstituted assays in terms of molecular properties , theoretical models are required which allow to calculate experimentally accessible quantities like duty ratio and force - velocity relation for small and variable number of motors in an ensemble .",
    "at the same time , known molecular characteristics , in particular the catch bond character of and conformational changes as the power stroke , should be included in the model .",
    "such a model should not only permit to estimate the number of motors present in the experiment , but also provide a deeper understanding of the generic principles governing the statistics of motor ensembles . here , we present such a model for the non - processive molecular motor .",
    "a short account of some of our results has been given previously @xcite .",
    "our work is motivated by the long tradition in modeling force generation in skeletal muscle .",
    "generic models for molecular motors investigate the fundamental conditions for the generation of directed motion in a thermal environment but do not take specific properties of molecular motors into account . in ratchet models , a particle switches between diffusive movement in a flat potential and in a periodic potential @xcite . by breaking detailed balance for the transitions between the two potential landscapes ,",
    "directed motion of the particle can ensue .",
    "ratchet models allow to study generic effects of cooperativity of a large number of motors such as the emergence of directed motion in symmetric systems or spontaneous oscillations @xcite .",
    "diffusion and switching of the particles is usually described in the framework of a fokker - planck equation . within this framework ,",
    "the effect of a finite ensemble size has been included by assuming a fluctuating drift velocity with a noise intensity that increases with decreasing ensemble size @xcite .",
    "this approach allows to observe effects specific for finite sized ensembles , such as the reversal of the direction of motion @xcite . beginning with the work of huxley @xcite ,",
    "some molecular characteristics were introduced by assuming different conformational states of the motor molecules . with the focus on the large assemblies of motors in muscle , analytical progress was usually made using mean - field approximations . a mean - field model for molecular motors with three conformational states , in which the bound motors moved with given velocity",
    "was used to calculate the force - velocity relation of an ensemble of motors @xcite . adapting the transition rates between the conformational states allowed to study processive as well as non - processive motors .",
    "onset of oscillatory behavior of the ensembles was investigated in a generic two - state model , in which conformational changes of the motors upon binding and unbinding allowed bound motors to exert force on their environment @xcite . here , the binding an unbinding rates could be adapted to describe different types of motors and different force - velocity relations . in a generalization , an ensemble of molecular motors working against a visco - elastic element",
    "was investigated @xcite . using a similar mean - field approach as @xcite for a two - state model ,",
    "the dynamic behavior of ensembles was investigated , revealing limit cycle oscillations induced by the coupling to the visco - elastic element . to describe specific properties of muscle fibers , crossbridge models with varying degree of detail",
    "have been used . using computer simulations on large ensemble of with a crossbridge model including explicitly the power stroke and load dependent unbinding from the post - power - stroke state , details of the force - velocity relation for muscle fibers",
    "could be fitted very accurately to experimental results and collective phenomena such as the synchronization of the power stroke under load or the transient response of muscle to a step change of the external load were investigated @xcite .",
    "coupling to an external elastic element allowed to observe oscillations for the crossbridge model @xcite .",
    "recently , a detailed crossbridge model for was used to describe also the activity of small ensembles in the cytoskeleton @xcite .",
    "the activity of small groups of in motility assays was studied using computer simulations .",
    "large ensembles were described in a mean - field approach . by comparison of the results to experiments , parameters of the model could be determined .",
    "the focus of the model was on the description of the dependence of the transition rates .",
    "therefore , the crossbridge model included two separate post - power - stroke states of the bound motors but did not include a bound pre - power - stroke state so that it did not explicitly described the power stroke .    in order to study effects of molecular details for ensembles of motors",
    ", we use a crossbridge model with three states as a starting point , which was originally used for skeletal muscle @xcite .",
    "unlike @xcite , we use a pre- and a post - power - stroke state as the two bound states , so that the power stroke of is included explicitly . to reduce the complexity of the analytical description , we make two approximations : @xmath12 we assume that molecular motors in equivalent conformational states have equal strain and @xmath13 we exploit a separation of time scales in the cycle and assume that there is thermal equilibrium of the bound states .",
    "the partial mean - field approximation of the first assumption still distinguishes between the two different bound states .",
    "it can be justified by the small duty ratio of motors which leads to a narrow distribution of the strains of bound motors .",
    "the assumption of local thermal equilibrium between bound states reduces the system to a two - state model .",
    "the effective properties of these states , however , still depend on the distribution over the two bound states .",
    "the two approximations allow us to derive a one - step master equation for the binding dynamics of the motors , which explicitly includes the effects of strain - dependent rates and small system size .",
    "a one - step master equation has been introduced before for transport by finite - sized ensembles of processive motors with slip bond behavior @xcite , but not for non - processive motors with catch bond behavior . together with rules for the displacement of en ensemble upon binding and unbinding , the one - step master equation fully characterizes the dynamics of ensembles .",
    "we investigate two paradigmatic loading conditions for the ensemble : constant loading and linear loading , in which the external load depends linearly on the position of the ensemble . for constant external load",
    ", we can solve the one - step master equation for the stationary states and derive binding properties and force - velocity relation from these .",
    "for linear external load , the movement of the ensemble feeds back to the load dependent binding rates , so that we have to use computer simulations to analyze this case . in both loading scenarios ,",
    "we find that the motor ensemble adapts its dynamical state to the external conditions in a way which is reminiscent of its physiological function .",
    "the motor head binds and and the lever arm is in the primed conformation ( gray in ( a ) ) . binding to the substrate brings the motor to the weakly - bound ( pre - power - stroke ) state @xmath14 with unchanged mechanical conformation .",

    "the unloaded off - rate for this last step is @xmath24 . due to the energy released in hydrolysis this transition",
    "is considered as irreversible , thus defining the direction of the motor cycle .",
    "most importantly in our context , both power stroke and unbinding from the post - power - stroke state depend on load .",
    "the power stroke @xmath25 moves the lever arm forward by the power - stroke distance @xmath17 and strains the elastic neck linker of a motor .",
    "replacing by and unbinding from @xmath15 requires an additional movement of the lever arm in the same direction as the power stroke , thus straining the neck linker further by the unbinding distance @xmath26 and making unbinding slower under load .",
    "the load dependent rates for these transition are denoted without the superscript ( see ) .      because non - processive molecular motors are bound only during a small fraction of the motor cycle they have to cooperate in groups to generate sustained levels of force or persistent motion against an external load .",
    "a sufficiently large number of motors ensures permanent attachment of the group while individual motors continuously unbind and rebind as they go through their motor cycle .",

    "the motors are firmly integrated into the rigid backbone of the motor filament whereas the motor heads bind to the substrate . in ( a )",
    ", the motors are oriented such that the lever arm swings towards the right during the power stroke , so that the motors exert force on the motor filament towards the right .",
    "the external load pulls the motor filament towards the left , against the motor direction .",
    "because the motors are attached directly to the motor filament , they are working effectively in parallel against the external load .",
    "such parallel arrangement was confirmed experimentally for the motors in the muscle sarcomere @xcite .",
    "we will discuss two paradigmatic situations for the external load : @xmath12 a constant external load , which is independent of the position of the motor filament , and @xmath13 an elastic external load , which increases linearly with the displacement of the motor filament .",
    "for constant external load , the ensemble will eventually reach a steady state of motion with load dependent velocity . for a linear external load , an isometric state with vanishing velocity",
    "is expected .",
    "experimentally , the unipolar ensemble of motors in ( a ) would represent one half of a thick filament in the muscle sarcomere or of a minifilament in the cytoskeleton . in this case",
    ", the external load is generated by the motors in the other half of the bipolar motor filament or is due to the tension in a surrounding actin network . in reconstituted assays",

    "constant load and ( @xmath27 ) linear load increasing with the displacement of the motor filament .",
    "the mechanical coupling of the motors through the rigid motor filament induces a dynamic coupling due to the strain dependence of the transition rates .",
    "( b ) in the _ parallel cluster model _ ( pcm ) all motors in a given mechano - chemical state are assumed to have the same strain .",
    "weakly - bound motors have the strain @xmath28 .",
    "the power stroke corresponds to a shortening of the bound molecular motor so that motors in the post - power - stroke state have the strain @xmath29 .",
    "the arrangement of the motors is equivalent to adhesion clusters of parallel bonds , where the closed bonds can be in two different conformations.[fig : fig02 ] ]    for an ensemble of parallel motors in mechanical equilibrium , the external load @xmath30 is balanced by the sum of elastic forces @xmath31 in the neck linkers of all bound motors : @xmath32 in this expression , @xmath18 is the elastic constant of the neck linkers , @xmath33 their elongation ( or strain ) and the index @xmath34 runs over all motors which are bound to the substrate .",
    "an imbalance of forces induces a change of the position of the motor filament .",
    "this changes the strain @xmath33 of all bound motors simultaneously until the balance of forces in is restored .",
    "in addition , a linear external load would be changed by the displacement of the motor filament . in the following , we assume that the relaxation time towards mechanical equilibrium is negligible in comparison with the time scale for stochastic transitions , so that the mechanical state of an ensemble always obeys the force balance in .",
    "anchoring of the motors to the rigid motor filament in combination with the condition of the force balance introduces a tight mechanical coupling between motors : a stochastic transition of one motor changes the force balance and hence the strain of all bound motors .",
    "thus , the strain @xmath33 of a bound motor does not only depend on the state of the motor itself but results from the past activity of the motor ensemble .",
    "specifically , @xmath33 is determined by the displacement of the motor filament after binding of a motor .",
    "therefore , determines the sum but not the individual strains of the motors : while the sum over the strain of the bound motors vanishes at vanishing external load , the individual strains @xmath33 will in general not .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath33 will be determined by the randomly distributed times during which a motor remains bound to the substrate and the displacement of the motor filament during these times .    because the rates for the stochastic transitions @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend on the strain of a motor , the mechanical coupling leads to a dynamical coupling of the motors , as illustrated in ( a ) .",
    "a stochastic description of the ensemble dynamics as a markov process would thus require not only the mechano - chemical state but also the strain of every motor as state variables . denoting the total number of motors in an ensemble by @xmath37 , the state space for an ensemble with @xmath37 motors would then encompass @xmath38 discrete states and @xmath37 independent , continuous variables ( @xmath39 considering ) .",
    "this complexity prohibits analytical solutions and previous approaches either used mean field models or computer simulations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . here",
    ", we use mean - field elements to arrive at an analytically tractable model , which preserves the molecular details contained in the crossbridge model and allows to study stochastic effects due to finite ensemble size . we make the assumption that all motors in the same mechano - chemical state have the same strain .",
    "this assumption is the essence of our _ parallel cluster model _ ( pcm ) ; its validity will be discussed in and demonstrated by comparison with computer simulations . as illustrated in ( b ) , the pcm effectively describes the ensemble of molecular motors as an adhesion cluster of parallel bonds @xcite . in this picture , the power stroke shortens the closed bonds by the power - stroke distance @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , closed bonds can be in two conformations with different lengths in which they carry different loads .",
    "all motors in a given conformation , however , carry an equal share of the external load and have the same strain .",
    "thus , all motors in a given mechano - chemical state are mechanically equivalent within the pcm so that the state of a motor ensemble of @xmath37 motors can be characterized by the number of motors in each of the mechano - chemical states .",

    "a small number of bound motors is able to work against the external load and the large number of unbound motors generates fast ensemble movement with little resistance from the bound motors . at large external load , on the other hand , the increase of the number of bound motors allows to increase the stall force of the ensemble relative to the case of a constant number of bound motors .",
    "thus , the mechanosensitive response of to a constant external load greatly increases the dynamic range over which ensembles can operate and the robustness of ensemble movement . as demonstrated in ,",
    "the apparent load - sensitivity of becomes stronger for small duty ratios , for which a stronger increase of the number of bound motors is observed .",
    "the relevance of this mechanism of mechanosensitivity for the efficiency of motor ensembles is underlined by the experimental observation of the increase of the number of bound motors in muscle filaments which use @xcite and the recent identification of a similar load - sensitive step in myosin i @xcite .",
    "this last result indicates that the mechanisms described here might have wider applications .",
    "in addition to reproducing previous results for large ensembles , our model in particular allows to identify the range of ensemble sizes in which stochastic detachment of ensembles is relevant and reduces the efficiency of ensembles .",
    "as demonstrated in , this range depends strongly on the duty ratio of the single motor . the smaller the single motor duty ratio , the larger is the number of motors in an ensemble that is needed to ensure practically permanent attachment . for the model parameters used in the main part of the manuscript ,",
    "the single motor duty ratio is similar but slightly larger than reported for non - muscle @xcite . here",
    ", it turns out that roughly @xmath255 motors are needed for almost permanent attachment .",
    "this number is in the range of the size of minifilaments , in particular if one considers that due to spatial restrictions , not all motors which are contained in a minifilament can actually bind to a substrate at the same time .",
    "thus , unbinding will be relevant for cytoskeletal minifilaments .",
    "interestingly , due to the load - sensitivity of minifilaments , detachment of the ensembles will occur most frequently for ensemble under small load whereas ensembles working against large external load are stabilized by the catch bond character of so that they can form efficient crosslinkers of actin fibers .    for linear external load",
    ", it has been shown that the load - sensitivity of the unbinding step is less relevant for the behavior of a motor ensemble .",
    "rather , the reverse transition from the post - power - stroke state to the weakly - bound state , which is induced by the stiffness of the external spring or by large external load , eventually stalls the ensemble in the isometric state .",
    "as long as the stiffness of the external spring is below the critical threshold , ensembles can move forward until the isometric state is reached .",
    "because ensembles adapt their position dynamically towards the isometric state , characteristic dynamic properties such as the detachment time or the typical number of bound motors in the isometric state are independent of the external elastic constant state and increases significantly only when the critical stiffness is reached .",
    "thus , measuring the change of the number of bound motors with the stiffness of the external force is a characteristic sign of the relative size of the unbinding rates from the different bound states of the motors . the critical value of @xmath52 above which ensemble are no longer able to generate force allows to determine the free energy bias towards the post - power - stroke state .",
    "the qualitative change of behavior of the ensemble should allow to observe this experimentally even in noisy data , e.g.  in extensions of the three bead assay with better control over the number of motors .",
    "typical stochastic trajectories reveal a behavior which is qualitatively similar to previously predicted or experimentally observed types of behavior . for relatively large ensembles which do not unbind ,",
    "a sort of irregular oscillation pattern has been observed , similar to the oscillation predicted using a ratchet model for large ensembles of motors @xcite .",
    "the linear increase of stress followed by a fast stress relaxation which is observed in three bead assays @xcite and in active gels @xcite has been reproduced for the case that unbinding from the substrate occurs before the ensemble reaches its equilibrium position .",
    "the sequence of reaction in our basic crossbridge model is compatible with experiments @xcite .",
    "compared to other models , we have neglected one additional post - power - stroke state , which will be important for detailed descriptions of the force - velocity relation in skeletal muscle @xcite or inclusion of the dependence of the motor cycle @xcite .",
    "the dependence , however , could also be included in our model via an dependent off - rate from the post - power - stroke state .",
    "on the other hand , our model explicitly includes the weakly - bound state ( or pre - power - stroke state ) as a load bearing state , which is omitted by @xcite . because for constant external load , the weakly - bound state is hardly occupied so that motors bind effectively directly to the post - power - stroke state as in @xcite . for linear external load , however , the isometric state of the ensemble",
    "is determined by the transition from the post - power - stroke to the weakly - bound state , which could not be described without a model for the power stroke . without the weakly - bound state , which is stable under load ,",
    "this transition would destabilize the ensemble instead of stabilizing it .",
    "the choice of the set of parameters used in our model was motivated by previous modeling approaches and did not aim at a description of a specific molecular motor . however , the basic conclusions of the model do not depend on the exact choice of parameters .",
    "the only prerequisite for the application of the model is that transitions between the bound states are fast so that the local thermal equilibrium can establish .",
    "comparison with simulations without pcm or lte have shown that this requires a forward rate @xmath346 for the power stroke which is faster than the off - rate @xmath21 from the weakly - bound state .",
    "thus , our model can be used with different choices of parameters .",
    "this is demonstrated in for different choices of the single motor duty ratio .",
    "the discussion of the result has demonstrated the dependence of experimentally measurable quantities such as the number of bound motors , the load free velocity or the stall force on the model parameters so that the parameters can be adapted to describe a desired behavior of the motor ensemble .",
    "ensembles of non - processive motors behave very similarly to processive motors with a specific force - velocity relation and a typical walk length .",
    "the analytical expressions allow to integrate such ensembles in larger systems in a similar manner as it has been done for processive motors @xcite .",
    "in such a systems , ensembles of ensembles would be multiply coupled either in series or in parallel through forces that they generate .",
    "such model could be used to describe , e.g.  tension generation in a stress fibers or the cell actin cortex .",
    "since the relaxation to the stationary values is relatively fast , slow external stimuli , changing for example the motor activity , could be included to mimic signaling events which a cell experiences , e.g.  during cell migration .",
