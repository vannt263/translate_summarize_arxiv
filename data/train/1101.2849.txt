    "equilibrium statistical mechanics is a well - established field that embodies classical thermodynamics ( see e.g. f. reif , 1965 @xcite ) . in an extremely terse formulation",
    ", this theory could be summarized by saying that the relevant features of the microscopic physics of any system are encoded in a probability measure for which , at thermal equilibrium , a mathematical formula is known .",
    "indeed , a system in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath1 occupies all accessible microscopic configurations @xmath2 with a probability @xmath3 , given by the boltzmann - gibbs canonical law : @xmath4 @xmath5 being the energy of the configuration @xmath6 .",
    "the partition function @xmath7 ( or ` sum over states ' ) is related to the thermodynamic free energy f via the relation @xmath8 this relation is nothing but an avatar of the celebrated boltzmann law , @xmath9 .",
    "macroscopic observables are obtained by taking the expectation values of the corresponding microscopic observables with respect to the canonical measure  .",
    "these postulates provide us with a _ well - defined prescription _ to analyze systems _ at equilibrium_. in particular , equilibrium statistical mechanics predicts macroscopic fluctuations ( typically gaussian ) that are out of reach of classical thermodynamics : the paradigm of such fluctuations is the brownian motion .    for systems",
    "far from equilibrium , a fundamental theory that would generalize the formalism of equilibrium statistical mechanics to time - dependent processes is not yet available . a schematic non - equilibrium process can be represented as a rod in contact with two reservoirs at different temperatures , or at different electrical ( chemical ) potentials ( see figure  [ fig : courant ] ) . in the stationary regime , a constant current flows through the system .",
    "many fundamental questions remain to be answered in order to understand the physics of such a simple system : what are the relevant parameters that would fully characterize the macroscopic state of a non - equilibrium system ?",
    "can the stationary state be defined as the optimum of some ( unknown ) macroscopic functions of some ( unknown ) parameters ?",
    "does a general equation of state exist ?",
    "can one classify non - equilibrium processes into ` universality classes ' ? can one postulate a general form for some non - equilibrium microscopic measures ?",
    "what do the fluctuations in the vicinity of a stationary state look like ?",
    "a large amount of research has been devoted to these questions and to some related ones .",
    "although the theory is far from being complete , substantial progress has been made , particularly during the last twenty years .",
    "there are different ways to try to tackle the profound questions raised above .",
    "one line of research consists in exploring structural properties of non - equilibrium systems : this endeavour has led to celebrated results such as fluctuation theorems ( gallavotti and cohen , 1995 @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , non - equilibrium work relations ( jarzynski , 1997 @xcite ) or macroscopic fluctuation theory ( g. jona - lasinio and co - workers , see e.g. l. bertini et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another strategy to gain insight into non - equilibrium physics is to extract as much information as possible from analytical studies and from exact solutions of some special models .",
    "the ising model , that has played a fundamental role in the theory of phase transitions , critical exponents and renormalization group , is a landmark of this style of research . in the field of non - equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics , the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is reaching the status of such a paradigm .",
    "the asep consists of particles on a lattice , that hop from a site to its immediate neighbours , and satisfy the exclusion condition : a given location must be occupied by at most one particle .",
    "therefore , a jump is allowed only if the target site is empty .",
    "physically , the exclusion constraint mimics short - range interactions amongst particles .",
    "besides , in order to drive this lattice gas out of equilibrium , non - vanishing currents must be established in the system .",
    "this can be achieved by various means : by starting from non - uniform initial conditions , by coupling the system to external reservoirs that drive currents @xcite through the system ( transport of particles , energy , heat ) or by introducing some intrinsic bias in the dynamics that favors motion in a privileged direction .",
    "then , each particle is an asymmetric random walker that drifts steadily along the direction of an external driving force . due to its simplicity",
    ", this model has appeared in different contexts .",
    "it was first proposed as a prototype to describe the dynamics of ribosomes along rna @xcite . in the mathematical literature ,",
    "brownian processes with hard - core interactions were defined by spitzer @xcite who coined the name exclusion process ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the asep also describes transport in low - dimensional systems with strong geometrical constraints @xcite such as macromolecules transiting through capillary vessels @xcite , anisotropic conductors , or quantum dots where electrons hop to vacant locations and repel each other via coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "very popular modern applications of the exclusion process include molecular motors that transport proteins along filaments inside the cells and , of course , asep and its variants are ubiquitous in discrete models of traffic flow @xcite .",
    "more generally , the asep belongs to the class of driven diffusive systems defined by katz , lebowitz and spohn in 1984 @xcite . for a general discussion",
    ", we refer to e.g. , the book of h. spohn @xcite the review of b.  schmittmann and r. k. p. zia @xcite and that of g.  m.  schtz @xcite .",
    "an early review of the properties of the asep can be found in derrida , 1998 @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the asep is defined through dynamical rules : there is no energy associated with a microscopic configuration and thus there is no possibility of writing the stationary measure in the canonical form .",
    "more generally , the kinetic point of view seems to be a promising and fruitful approach to non - equilibrium systems : for such a presentation of statistical mechanics , we highly recommend to the reader the recent book by p.",
    "l. krapivsky et al .",
    "@xcite .    to summarize , the asep is a minimal model to study non - equilibrium behaviour ( see figure  [ fig : asepgeneral ] ) .",
    "it is simple enough to allow analytical studies , however it contains the necessary ingredients for the emergence of a non - trivial phenomenology @xcite :    * asymmetric : the external driving breaks detailed - balance and creates a stationary current in the system @xcite .",
    "the model exhibits a non - equilibrium stationary state . *",
    "exclusion : the hard core - interaction implies that there is at most 1 particle per site .",

    "interact through the exclusion constraint.,height=66 ]    the outline of this article is as follows . in section  [ sec : ba ]",
    ", we study spectral properties of the asep on a ring by using the coordinate bethe ansatz .",
    "we review the general technique and focus on the tasep case , which , in our opinion , is one of the simplest models that allows to understand how the bethe ansatz method works . in section  [ sec : fluctcurrent ] , we explain how the fluctuations of the total current in the asep can be calculated using a functional formulation of the bethe ansatz ; we review the exact results obtained and the different scaling regimes that appear in the limit of systems of large sizes . in section  [ sec : multi ] , we study a generalization of the asep in which different classes of particles interact through hierarchical dynamical rules .",
    "we show how the steady state of such systems can be determined by using a matrix product representation that involves tensor products of quadratic algebras .",
    "we consider the exclusion process on a periodic one dimensional lattice with @xmath10 sites ( sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 are identical ) and @xmath0 particles .",
    "because a lattice site can not be occupied by more than one particle , the state of a site @xmath11 ( @xmath13 ) can be characterized by the boolean number @xmath14 according as the site @xmath11 is empty or occupied .",
    "the system evolves in continuous time according to the following stochastic rule : a particle on a site @xmath11 at time @xmath15 jumps , in the interval between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with probability @xmath17 to the neighbouring site @xmath18 if this site is empty ( _ exclusion rule _ ) and with probability @xmath19 to the site @xmath20 if this site is empty ( see figure  [ fig : asepring ] ) . in the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) the jumps are totally biased in one direction ( @xmath21 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the _ symmetric _ exclusion process ( sep ) corresponds to the choice @xmath22 .",
    "the number @xmath0 of particles is conserved by the dynamics .",
    "the total number of configurations for @xmath0 particles on a ring with @xmath10 sites is given by @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "a configuration @xmath24 can be represented by the sequence @xmath25 we call @xmath26 the probability of configuration @xmath24 at time @xmath15 .",
    "as the exclusion process is a continuous - time markov process , the time evolution of @xmath26 is determined by the master equation @xmath27 the markov matrix @xmath28 encodes the dynamics of the exclusion process : the element @xmath29 is the transition rate from configuration @xmath30 to @xmath24 and the diagonal term @xmath31 represents the exit rate from configuration @xmath24",
    ".    a right eigenvector @xmath32 is associated with the eigenvalue @xmath33 of @xmath28 if @xmath34    the matrix @xmath28 is a real non - symmetric matrix and , therefore , its eigenvalues ( and eigenvectors ) are either real numbers or complex conjugate pairs .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath28 contains the eigenvalue @xmath35 and the associated right eigenvector is the stationary state . for the asep on a ring the steady state",
    "is uniform and all configurations have the same probability @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "because the dynamics is ergodic ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath28 is irreducible and aperiodic ) , the perron - frobenius theorem ( see , for example , gantmacher 1959 @xcite ) implies that 0 is a non - degenerate eigenvalue and that all other eigenvalues @xmath33 have a strictly negative real part ; the relaxation time of the corresponding eigenmode is @xmath37 .",

    "since the works of dhar 1987 @xcite , and gwa and spohn 1992 @xcite , it is known that the bethe ansatz can be applied to the asep .",
    "the idea of the _ bethe ansatz _",
    "( h. bethe 1931 @xcite ) consists in writing the eigenvectors @xmath32 of the markov matrix as linear combinations of plane waves : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the group of the @xmath48 permutations of @xmath0 indexes .",
    "the coefficients @xmath49 and the wave - numbers @xmath50 are complex numbers to be determined .",
    "we observe that in the case where all particles are far from each other ( i.e. no particles are located on adjacent sites so that @xmath51 for all @xmath52 ) , each monomial that appears on the right hand side of the expression of the bethe wave function is a solution of the eigen - equation  , with an eigenvalue @xmath33 given by @xmath53 however , in order for the trial wave function to be a genuine eigenfunction , equation   must be fulfilled for all configurations : therefore , one has to insure that when two or more particles are adjacent equation   is still satisfied .",
    "the case where exactly two particles are adjacent and all other particles are well separated from one another is enough to fix the value of all the @xmath54 s ( up to an overall multiplicative constant ) .",
    "in other words , the form of the bethe wave - function   is fully determined by the ` two - body collisions ' .",
    "however , more particles can form larger clusters : this corresponds to @xmath55-body collisions with @xmath56 : such collisions impose further constraints that the bethe wave - function has no reasons , a priori , to satisfy .",
    "fortunately , in the present problem , the constraints imposed by the @xmath55-body collisions can be written as linear combinations of the two - body constraints and are therefore automatically satisfied by the bethe wave - function . in the bethe ansatz jargon ,",
    "this fact is formulated by saying that the @xmath57-body collisions _ factorize _ into @xmath58-body collisions etc ... this remarkable property , that can be verified explicitly in the case of equation  , lies at the heart of the _ integrability _ of the exclusion process , i.e. , it implies that the asep can be solved by bethe ansatz .",
    "in fact , the asep can be mapped exactly into well - studied systems such as quantum spin chains @xcite , vertex models @xcite or solid - on - solid models @xcite which are well - known to be integrable .    because we are studying the system on a homogeneous ring , the function @xmath32 must also satisfy the following periodic boundary conditions @xmath59 these periodic conditions quantify the eigenvalues by imposing a set of equations satisfied by the @xmath60 s , the _ bethe equations _ : @xmath61 this set of non - linear algebraic equations must be satisfied by the fugacities . therefore , in order to obtain the spectrum of the asep markov matrix one has first to find all @xmath0-tuplets @xmath62 that solve the bethe equations  .",
    "then , given a solution , one can calculate the corresponding eigenvalue   and eigenfunction  .",
    "of course , in practice this program can be carried out only in some special situations ( for example in a limited portion of the spectrum ) and usually one has to take the ` thermodynamic ' limit @xmath63 with a fixed value of the density @xmath64 . besides , the completeness issue ( i.e. whether the bethe ansatz does provide the full spectrum ) is a difficult problem in algebraic geometry @xcite .",
    "the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) , that corresponds to @xmath65 , provides a particularly instructive illustration of the bethe ansatz .",
    "the bethe equations take a simpler form on which analytical calculations can be carried out even for finite values of @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "the tasep is one of the simplest non - trivial models that allows to understand how the bethe ansatz technique works . in this subsection",
    ", we present a complete and self - contained derivation of the bethe ansatz for the tasep .",
    "first , we show that the bethe wave function @xmath32 of the tasep can be written as a determinant @xcite .",
    "the form of this determinant can be guessed heuristically by working out explicitly examples for small systems .",
    "here , we reverse the logic and _ define _ @xmath32 as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a @xmath68 matrix with elements @xmath69 @xmath70 being @xmath0 complex numbers . by expanding the determinant ,",
    "one recovers the generic form   for the bethe wave function @xmath32 .",
    "we now show that @xmath32 , thus defined , is a solution of the eigenvalue equation   with @xmath21 .",
    "first , we need to prove that @xmath32 satisfies two identities which are valid for any values of @xmath60 and of @xmath71 .",
    "the first identity is @xmath72 \\ , ,     \\label{eq : evp}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is given by @xmath73 we emphasize that this equality is true for any @xmath74 and @xmath70 without imposing the ordering @xmath41 .",
    "besides , @xmath55 runs from 1 to @xmath0 without any restriction , i.e. we do _ not _ impose that @xmath51 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : evp ] ) is proved by writing @xmath75 this determinant is similar to @xmath76 except for the @xmath55-th column . expanding this determinant over all permutations of @xmath77 and performing the sum over @xmath78 leads to the desired equation .",
    "the second identity takes care of the two particles collision case : it is valid for any @xmath70 and any @xmath79 with @xmath80 , and is given by @xmath81 this identity is proved as follows : we rewrite the left hand side of equation  ( [ eq : kk+1 ] ) as the determinant @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a matrix that is identical to @xmath67 except for its @xmath55-th column that is given by @xmath84 we remark that the @xmath85-th and the @xmath55-th columns of @xmath83 are equal and , therefore , @xmath86 , proving equation  ( [ eq : kk+1 ] ) .    to conclude , we note that the eigenvalue equation   is similar to equation  ( [ eq : evp ] ) except that in   the sum is restricted to the allowed jumps of particles , i.e. , to the values of @xmath55 such that @xmath87 .",
    "however , in equation  ( [ eq : evp ] ) , the terms with @xmath88 vanish thanks to equation  ( [ eq : kk+1 ] ) .",
    "hence , equation  ( [ eq : evp ] ) is in fact exactly the same as the eigenvalue equation when the eigenvector has the form assumed in equations  ( [ eq : psidet ] , [ eq : r ] ) .    finally , because of the periodic boundary conditions  , the @xmath60 s are quantified by the bethe equations , that we now rederive .",
    "denoting by @xmath11 and @xmath44 the generic line and column of the matrix @xmath67 , we can write @xmath89 by cyclic permutation of the columns , we obtain @xmath90 the last expression will be equal to @xmath91 if @xmath92 are solutions of the tasep bethe equations : @xmath93 these equations can of course be obtained by substituting @xmath94 in the general bethe equations   for asep .",
    "we note that determinantal representations of the eigenvectors and of the exact probability distribution at finite time play an important role in the study of the tasep since the seminal work of g. m. schtz @xcite , that has been generalized further by v.  b.  priezzhev @xcite and n.  m.  bogoliubov @xcite ( see e.g. the review of v.  b.  priezzhev 2005 @xcite ) .      the bethe equations for the tasep exhibit a remarkable ` decoupling ' property that allows to perform analytical calculations even for finite values of @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "using the auxiliary variables @xmath95 , the bethe equations   become @xmath96 we note that the right - hand side of these equations is independent of the index @xmath11 : this property is true only for the tasep where the bethe equations decouple and can be reduced to a polynomial in one - variable plus a self - consistency equation as shall be explained below .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath33 of the markov matrix @xmath28 is given by @xmath97 the solutions of the bethe equations  ( [ eq : bez ] ) are the roots of the polynomial equation of degree @xmath10 @xmath98 where @xmath99 is determined self - consistently by the r.h.s . of equation  ( [ eq : bez ] ) .",
    "given an arbitrary value of the complex number @xmath99 , the roots of the polynomial  ( [ eq : zzy ] ) display a simple geometrical layout .",
    "if we write @xmath100 , @xmath101 being a positive real number , we observe that equation  ( [ eq : zzy ] ) implies that @xmath102 where @xmath64 is the particle density in the system .",
    "the curves defined in the complex plane for @xmath103 are known as _",
    "cassini ovals _ ( see figure  [ fig : cassini ] ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cassini ] , the topology of the cassini ovals depends on the value of @xmath101 with a critical value : @xmath104 for @xmath105 , the curve consists of two disjoint ovals with @xmath0 solutions on the oval surrounding @xmath106 and @xmath107 solutions on the oval surrounding @xmath108 . for @xmath109 , the curve is a deformed bernoulli lemniscate with a double point at @xmath110 . for @xmath111 ,",
    "the curve is a single loop with @xmath10 solutions .",
    "note that the cassini ovals are symmetrical only if @xmath112 ; in this case @xmath113        this geometric layout leads to the following procedure for solving the bethe equations for the tasep ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) :    * _ solve _ , for any given value of @xmath99 , the equation @xmath114 the roots are located on cassini ovals * _ choose @xmath0 roots _ @xmath115 amongst the @xmath10 available roots , with a _ choice set _ @xmath116 * _ solve _ the self - consistent equation @xmath117 where @xmath118 * _ deduce _ from the value of @xmath99 , the @xmath119 s and the energy corresponding to the choice set @xmath120  : @xmath121    eigenvalues of the markov matrix are thus related to the choice sets of roots on the cassini ovals ; there is a strong evidence @xcite that choice sets are in one - to - one correspondence with the eigenvalues of the markov matrix .",
    "a simple argument is that the total number of choice sets is given by @xmath23 $ ] which is precisely the size of the markov matrix .",
    "the choice function @xmath122 that selects the @xmath0 fugacities @xmath123 with the largest real parts ( see figure  [ fig : cassini ] ) provides the ground state of the markov matrix .",
    "the spectral gap , given by the first excited eigenvalue , corresponds to the choice @xmath124 for @xmath125 and @xmath126 @xcite . for this choice set",
    ", the calculation can be carried out explicitly and one can show that , in the large @xmath10 limit , the first excited state is given by a solution of a transcendental equation . for a density @xmath127 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath128 the first excited state consists of a pair of conjugate complex numbers when @xmath127 is different from 1/2 . the real part of @xmath129 describes the relaxation towards the stationary state : we find that the largest relaxation time scales as @xmath130 with the dynamical exponent @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "this value agrees with the dynamical exponent of the one - dimensional kardar - parisi - zhang equation that belongs to the same universality class as asep ( see the review of halpin - healy and zhang 1995 @xcite ) .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath129 represents the relaxation oscillations and scales as @xmath132 ; these oscillations correspond to a kinematic wave that propagates with the group velocity @xmath133 : such traveling waves can be probed by dynamical correlations @xcite .",
    "the same procedure also allows to classify the higher excitations in the spectrum @xcite . for the partially asymmetric case ( @xmath134 ) , the bethe equations do not decouple and analytical results are much harder to obtain . a systematic procedure for calculating the finite size corrections of the upper region of the asep spectrum",
    "was developed by doochul kim @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the results presented here are valid for the asep on a finite periodic lattice .",
    "problems with open boundary conditions @xcite or on infinite lattices",
    "@xcite require different approaches .",
    "in particular , the exclusion process on the infinite line has fascinating connections with random matrix theory and with the robinson - schensted - knuth correspondence . more precisely , consider the _ totally _ asymmetric case and suppose that the initial configuration of the tasep is such that all sites @xmath135 are occupied and all sites with @xmath136 are empty .",
    "then , the probability that a particle initially at @xmath137 moves at least @xmath138 steps to the right in time @xmath15 equals the probability distribution of the largest eigenvalue in a unitary laguerre random matrix ensemble .",
    "this crucial fact , first understood by johannson in 2000 @xcite , allows to relate the statistical properties of the _ totally _ asymmetric exclusion process to the classical tracy - widom laws @xcite for the largest eigenvalue in ensembles of random matrices .",
    "the study of such relations has become a subfield per se and has stimulated many works ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the determinantal representation of the transition probabilities of the tasep allows to retrieve johannson s result in a very appealing manner @xcite .",
    "more recently , in a series of articles @xcite , c. a. tracy and h. widom have found some integral formulas for the probability distribution of an individual particle starting from step initial conditions in the asymmetric exclusion process with general parameter values ( i.e. allowing forward and backward jumps ) .",
    "these expressions can be rewritten as a single integral involving a fredholm determinant , that is amenable to asymptotic analysis . in particular , a limit theorem is proven for the total current distribution .",
    "these breakthroughs extend the results of johansson on tasep to asep : this is a crucial progress because the weakly asymmetric process leads to a well - defined continuous limit . in particular , a very important outgrow of these studies are the recent papers of h. spohn , t. sasamoto and s. prolhac , in which the height fluctuations of the kardar - parisi - zhang equation and @xmath138-point correlation functions are exactly derived , solving a problem that remained open for 25 years ( see the articles of h. spohn and t. sasamoto , and of p. l. ferrari in the present special issue ) . for an overview of all these fascinating problems ,",
    "we refer the reader to the recent review article by kriecherbauer and krug 2010 @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the bethe ansatz can be used in models that are closely related to the asep , such as the zero - range process @xcite , the raise and peel model @xcite , vicious walkers @xcite or the bernoulli matching model of sequence alignment @xcite .",
    "in this section , we explain how the statistics of the total current @xcite in the asep on a ring can be determined by the bethe ansatz .",
    "in particular , we show that the fluctuations of the current can display a non - gaussian behaviour in contrast with the equilibrium case .",

    "the evolution equation of @xmath140 is : @xmath142 using the generating function @xmath143 @xmath144 the evolution equation becomes @xmath145 this equation is similar to the original markov equation  ( [ eq : markov ] ) for the probability distribution @xmath146 but now the original markov matrix @xmath28 is deformed by a jump - counting _ fugacity _",
    "@xmath147 into @xmath148 ( which is not a markov matrix in general ) , given by @xmath149 in the long time limit , @xmath150 , the behaviour of @xmath143 is dominated by the largest eigenvalue @xmath151 and one can write @xmath152 thus , in the long time limit , the function @xmath151 is the generating function of the cumulants of the total current @xmath139 .",
    "but @xmath151 is also the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , the current statistics has been traded into an eigenvalue problem .",
    "fortunately , the deformed matrix @xmath148 can still be diagonalized by the bethe ansatz .",
    "in fact , a small modification of the calculations described in section  [ sec : ba ] leads to the following bethe ansatz equations @xmath153 the eigenvalues of @xmath148 are given by @xmath154 the cumulant generating function corresponds to the largest eigenvalue .",
    "one can define @xmath155 , the _ large - deviation function _ of the current , as follows @xmath156 it can be shown using   that @xmath157 and @xmath151 are the legendre transforms of each other .",
    "large deviation functions play an increasingly important role in non - equilibrium statistical physics ( see h. touchette 2009 @xcite ) , in particular in relation to the fluctuation theorem @xcite .",
    "thus , determining exact expression for these large deviation functions for interacting particle processes , either analytically or numerically is a major challenge in the field ( we refer the reader to the review of b. derrida , 2007 @xcite ) . besides ,",
    "higher cumulants of the current and large deviations are also of experimental interest in relation to counting statistics in quantum systems @xcite .",

    "moreover , the shape of this function is skew : it decays as the exponential of a power law with an exponent @xmath169 for @xmath170 and with an exponent @xmath171 for @xmath172 .      in the general case @xmath173",
    ", the bethe ansatz equations do not decouple and a procedure for solving them was lacking .",
    "for example , it did not even seem possible to extract from the bethe equations   a formula for the mean stationary current ( which can be obtained very easily by other means from the fact that the stationary measure is uniform ) .",
    "finally , the solution was found by rewriting the bethe ansatz as a functional equation and restating it as a purely algebraic problem .",
    "we explain here the method we followed @xcite and describe some of the results obtained .",
    "first , we perform the following change of variables , @xmath174 in terms of the variables @xmath175 the bethe equations read @xmath176 here again the equations do not decouple as soon as @xmath134 . however , these equations are now built from first order monomials in the @xmath175 s and they are symmetrical in these variables .",
    "this observation suggests to introduce an _ auxiliary variable _",
    "@xmath177 that plays the same role with respect to all the @xmath175 s and allows to define the auxiliary equation : @xmath178 this equation , in which @xmath177 is the unknown , and the @xmath175 s are parameters , can be rewritten as a polynomial equation : @xmath179 because the bethe equations   imply that @xmath180 for @xmath181 , the polynomial @xmath182 , defined as @xmath183 must divide the polynomial @xmath184 .",

    "this limit was also studied by lee and kim @xcite .",

    "in fact , when @xmath225 the optimal profile is time - dependent . the critical value of the total current for which this phase - transition occurs is @xmath226 and therefore one must have @xmath227 for this transition to occur .",

    "from the mathematical point of view , the asep is one of the simplest but non - trivial model for which the hydrodynamic limit can be rigorously proved . at large scales ,",
    "the distribution of the particles of the asep emerges as a density field that evolves according to burgers equation with a vanishingly small viscosity @xcite .",
    "the burgers equation is the textbook prototype for shock formation : a smooth initial distribution can develop a singularity ( a discontinuity ) in finite time .",
    "a natural question that arises is whether this shock is an artifact of the hydrodynamic limit or whether , under some specific conditions , the original asep does display some singularity at the microscopic scale @xcite .",
    "the question was answered positively : an abrupt transition does exist at the level of the particle system and its width is of the order of the lattice size .",
    "however , defining precisely the position of the shock at the microscopic level requires some thought , and this was achieved by introducing a second - class particle ( see e.g. , p. a. ferrari , 1992 @xcite ) .",
    "this second class particle behaves as a first - class particle with respect to holes and as a hole with respect to first - class particles .",
    "the dynamical rules thus take the following form : @xmath228 where all transitions occur with rate 1 .",
    "this dynamics corresponds to coupling two tasep models . in order to locate the shock",
    "it is enough to introduce a single second class particle in the system .",
    "a straightforward generalization of the two species case of first and second class particles is the multispecies process where there is a hierarchy amongst the different species : first class particles have highest priority and can overtake all other classes of particles ; second class particles can overtake all other classes except the first class etc ... hence , during an infinitesimal time step @xmath229 , the following processes take place on each bond with probability @xmath229 : @xmath230 note that particles can always overtake holes (= 0-th class particles ) .",
    "this model will be called the @xmath0-tasep and it can be obtained by coupling @xmath0 ordinary tasep models @xcite .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath231 particles of class @xmath232 on a ring of size @xmath10 .",
    "then , the total number of configurations is given by @xmath233 the total number of particles is given @xmath234 .",
    "we warn the reader that in this section @xmath0 denotes the number of species and not the number of particles .    the object of this section is to provide an algebraic description of the stationary measure of this system .",
    "the idea of representing the stationary weights of a configuration as traces over a quadratic algebra goes back to the seminal article of derrida , evans , hakim and pasquier in 1993 @xcite .",
    "these authors were studying the 1-species tasep with open boundary conditions but they realized that the same idea could also be applied to the two species asep on a ring ( derrida , janowski , lebowitz and speer , 1993 @xcite ) .",
    "this technique , known as the matrix product representation ( or matrix ansatz ) , has been exceptionally fruitful in the field of one - dimensional stochastic models and has led to a very large number of exact solutions .",
    "this method seems to be complementary to the bethe ansatz in many problems and the exact relations between the two techniques is not yet fully understood @xcite .",
    "a solver s guide to the matrix ansatz method has recently been written by r.a .",
    "blythe and m. r. evans @xcite and contains many applications to various models .    here",
    ", we explain how the matrix ansatz works for the two species tasep on a ring , with dynamical rules given by  .",
    "a configuration of the model can be represented by a string made from the letters 1,2 and 0 , e.g. , @xmath235 . according to the matrix ansatz",
    ", the stationary weight of @xmath2 is given by @xmath236 where the string corresponding to @xmath2 has been rewritten using the alphabet @xmath237 and @xmath33 through the correspondence : @xmath238 @xmath239 and @xmath240 . here",
    "@xmath237 and @xmath33 are operators ( matrices ) which are in general non - commuting ; we suppose that the trace operation is well - defined on any product that contains at least one operator of each type .",
    "if the particles were totally independent then the stationary measure would be factorized and the probability of having a 0,1 or 2 at a site will be equal , respectively , to the density @xmath241 of holes , @xmath242 of 1 s or @xmath243 of 2 s .",
    "of course , this is not true : the particles are strongly correlated by the dynamics .",
    "the matrix product representation can be ` justified ' a posteriori in an informal way by saying that in this ansatz the stationary measure remains somehow factorized but correlations are taken into account because the operators @xmath237 and @xmath33 do not commute . as usual , the factor @xmath7 in equation   is a normalization factor .    the operators @xmath237 and @xmath33 have to be chosen adequately so that the ansatz   corresponds to the zero - eigenvector of the markov matrix .",
    "it can be shown that the right choice in the case of the 2-tasep model on a ring is obtained when these operators satisfy the following relations : @xmath244 the operators @xmath237 and @xmath33 thus define a _",
    "quadratic algebra_. these algebraic rules are enough to allow the computation of the steady state probability of any configuration .",
    "for example , @xmath245 the overall normalization constant can also be determined .",
    "it is possible to prove from algebraic relations  ( [ eq : algebre1 ] , [ eq : algebre2 ] , [ eq : algebre3 ] ) that the weights defined by the matrix ansatz correspond to the stationary probabilities .",
    "this ansatz allows to calculate many stationary state properties such as currents , correlations , fluctuations @xcite . besides",
    ", it can be shown , using matrix ansatz , that the stationary measure of the two species tasep on a ring is not gibbsean ( speer , 1993 @xcite ) .    the algebra  ( [ eq : algebre1 ] , [ eq : algebre2 ] , [ eq : algebre3 ] ) encodes combinatorial recursion relations between configurations corresponding to different system sizes .",
    "although most of the calculations can be done just by using the abstract algebraic relations between @xmath162 , @xmath33 and @xmath246 that define the algebra , it can be sometimes helpful to work with an explicit representation .",
    "the non - commuting representations of the algebra  ( [ eq : algebre1 ] , [ eq : algebre2 ] , [ eq : algebre3 ] ) are necessarily infinite dimensional .",
    "one of the most popular representation is the following : @xmath247 these matrices operate on an infinite dimensional space with countable basis .",
    "it we write @xmath248 and @xmath249 , we note that @xmath250 corresponds the right - shift and @xmath251 to the left - shift .",
    "the operator @xmath246 is simply the projector on first coordinate .",
    "we also remark that any finite product of the matrices @xmath162 , @xmath33 and @xmath246 that contains at least one @xmath246 is a finite rank matrix and thus has a finite trace .",
    "apart from an isolated attempt to solve the 3-tasep using the matrix ansatz that did not seem to extend to higher class models @xcite , no representation for the @xmath252tasep stationary measure was known until 2007 .",
    "the breakthrough was made in the mathematical literature and came from a very different direction , queuing theory .      in  @xcite ,",
    "p. a. ferrari and j. b. martin found an independent construction of the 2-tasep steady state that does not rely on the matrix ansatz but rather on a queuing model interpretation .",
    "these authors construct a 2-tasep configuration with @xmath253 first class particles and @xmath254 second class particles starting from two independent configurations of the 1 species tasep defined on two parallel lines .",
    "one starts from a two - line configuration of particles ( with at most one particle per site ) .",
    "the following algorithm will be easier to follow by looking at figure  [ fig : ferrarimartin ] in which the construction in drawn step by step : on line 1 there are @xmath253 particles distributed randomly amongst the @xmath10 available sites . on line 2 ,",
    "there are @xmath255 particles also distributed randomly amongst the @xmath10 sites . working from right to left we associate to each particle on line 1 , the nearest particle , at the site just below it or to its left , on line 2 that has not been already associated to another particle .",
    "the particles in line 2 that are paired to particles on the first line are labeled 1 ; the @xmath254 particles on line 2 that remain unassociated are labeled 2 .",
    "the empty sites of line 2 are labeled 0 , thus each site of line 2 is labeled 0 , 1 or 2 .",
    "hence , a configuration of the two species tasep containing @xmath253 first - class and @xmath254 second - class particles is generated by the construction . since we consider periodic boundary conditions , the site at which we begin this procedure will not affect the two species tasep configuration that is obtained .",
    "the procedure is summarized in figure  [ fig : fmresume ] .",
    "c   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +         it is important to note that this construction is not one - to one : different configurations of the @xmath253 particles on line 1 can lead to the same final 2-tasep configuration on line 2 .",
    "the fundamental claim , proved in  @xcite , is the following : _ the weight of a 2-tasep configuration is proportional to the total number of ways you can generate it by the ferrari - martin construction . _ by examining carefully the figure  [ fig : fmresume ] , one can make the following fundamental observations :    * a particle 1 ( on the 1st line ) can not be located above a 2 on the 2nd line . *   * factorisation property : * all the 1 s ( on the 2nd line ) situated between two 2 s must be linked to 1 s ( on the 1st line ) that are located between the positions of the two 2 s _ ( no crossing condition)_. *   * ` pushing ' procedure : * the _ ` ancestors ' _ of a string of the type @xmath256 are the strings obtained by pushing the 1 s to the right i.e. , @xmath257 .    in fact , these properties uniquely characterize the stationary weights .",
    "furthermore , one can prove that the matrix ansatz automatically performs the combinatorics underlying the geometrical construction of the weights .",
    "more precisely , one can construct in a systematic manner the quadratic algebra generated from @xmath258 and @xmath33 from the ferrari - martin procedure @xcite ; reciprocally one can deduce this procedure from the algebra  ( [ eq : algebre1 ] , [ eq : algebre2 ] , [ eq : algebre3 ] ) .",
    "this correspondence leads to the following properties :    * * the factorisation property * is related to the fact that @xmath246 is a * projector . *",
    "* * the pushing procedure * leads to the fact that@xmath162 and @xmath33 are * shift operators * ( right - shift and left - shift , respectively ) .",
    "the geometric construction of ferrari - martin was carried out recursively to the @xmath0-tasep model @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : fm3tasep ] , the 3-tasep is described : one starts with 3 lines of the 1-tasep , containing respectively @xmath253 , @xmath259 and @xmath260 particles with no labels .",
    "all the @xmath253 particles on the first line are in black and considered to be 1st - class particles .",
    "one starts by pairing from right to left the 1st - class particles from the 1st line to the 2nd line .",
    "this procedure is repeated from the 2nd line to the 3rd line on so on .",
    "each line has thus @xmath253 1st - class particles , in black .",
    "these 1st - class particles are now considered to be spectators .",
    "the @xmath254 unselected particles on the second line are 2nd - class particles , they are colored in red .",
    "we associate the @xmath254 red - particles of the second line to @xmath254 particles on the third line again from right to left . now on the third line , we have @xmath253 1st - class particles ( in black ) , @xmath254 2nd - class particles ( in red ) , and the remaining , unselected , @xmath261 particles are 3rd - class particles ( in blue ) .",
    "we have thus constructed a 3-tasep configuration on the third line .",
    "this method extends to the @xmath0-tasep in a natural manner ( for a precise description see @xcite ) .        here",
    "again , the same 3-tasep configuration on the third line can be generated in different ways .",
    "the weight of a 3-tasep configuration is proportional to the total number of ways you can generate it by this construction .",
    "the matrix ansatz for the 3-tasep is the algebraic counterpart of this procedure .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the recursive geometrical construction leads to a hierarchical definition of the operators @xmath262 and @xmath263 corresponding to the particles @xmath264 and 3 based on_tensor products _ of elements of the original quadratic algebra .",
    "indeed , for the 3-tasep case , we find using @xmath162 , @xmath246 and @xmath33 matrices and the shift operators @xmath265 and @xmath266 : @xmath267 more generally , the ferrari - martin construction allows to construct a matrix ansatz for the @xmath0-tasep and also provides an interpretation of the operators that appear in the matrix ansatz as priority queue matrices  @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the case of the @xmath0-asep model .",
    "if backward jumps are allowed ( rate @xmath134 ) , the @xmath0-asep dynamical rules are @xmath268 unfortunately , the ferrari - martin construction _ can not be generalized _ to the @xmath0-asep model .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the procedure for the tasep is local and directed ( a particle is associated with the nearest particle on its left in the next line ) and by introducing backward jumps the queuing theory interpretation is lost .",
    "in fact it can be shown that no construction similar to that of ferrari and martin can exist for the @xmath0-asep and this method can not be used to determine the steady state measure of the @xmath0-asep on a ring .    however , using the operators defined in equations  ( [ def : p0][def : p3 ] ) and deforming the underlying quadratic algebra in the following manner : @xmath269 we proved in @xcite that the deformed tensor algebra solves the @xmath0-asep .",
    "we note that the shift - operators , still defined by @xmath270 and @xmath271 , satisfy the _",
    "@xmath198-deformed oscillator algebra _ : @xmath272 as can be shown using equation  .",
    "in fact , a similar deformation method allows to find the steady state of the @xmath0-asep as proved in @xcite .    to conclude",
    ", we emphasize that in the present problem , the matrix ansatz is not simply a reformulation of a known algorithm but it also plays a constructive role and allows to derive new results which are not accessible by other means . besides , in the tasep case , the ferrari and martin construction provides for the first time @xcite an interpretation of the infinite - dimensional operators that appear in the matrix ansatz : the mapping to a queueing process provides a natural representation of the space on which the matrices act as counting operators ( for an alternative interpretation of the matrix ansatz see @xcite ) .",
    "there are many ways to generalize the tasep to multispecies models ( by introducing e.g. species - dependent switching rates , or open boundary conditions @xcite ) and we believe that the algebraic deformation technique explained above can be adapted to various unsolved problems .",
    "the @xmath0-asep also displays remarkable properties that have been investigated by combinatorial methods @xcite and partially by the bethe ansatz for @xmath273 @xcite but many open problems remain to be solved .",
    "the asymmetric exclusion process seems deceptively simple and the incredible number and complexity of the studies that it stimulated appears totally incredible .",
    "such a wonder seems to defy explanation .",
    "very few models have met such a rare success : one example that comes to mind is the ising model .",
    "the present article stems from a talk given at statphys24 and discusses some recent works .",
    "it does not pretend to be an exhaustive review .",
    "we focused on models on a finite periodic lattice that we analyzed by two techniques , the bethe ansatz and the matrix product representation .",
    "the bibliography , although quite substantial , reflects this subjective choice .",
    "the asep can be investigated through a huge variety of techniques : bethe ansatz , quadratic algebras , young tableaux , combinatorics , orthogonal polynomials , random matrices , stochastic differential equations , determinantal representations , hydrodynamic limits etc .",
    "each of these approaches is becoming a specific subfield that has its own links with other branches of theoretical physics and mathematics .",
    "we refer the reader who wishes to broaden his ( her ) perspective to recent review articles and to other contributions to this special issue .",
    "in particular , the asep on the infinite lattice , the relations with random matrix theory and the recently derived exact results for the kardar - parisi - zhang equation in one dimension , are reviewed in the articles of p. l. ferrari and of h. spohn and t. sasamoto .",
