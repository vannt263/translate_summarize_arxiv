    "relative phase plays an important role in quantum information .",
    "the encoding of information into the relative phase of quantum systems has been extensively used in quantum cryptographic @xcite , quantum cloning @xcite , geometric quantum computation @xcite and so on .",
    "phase estimation based on discrete quantum fourier transform ( qft ) is a comparatively good method to resolve some phase problems .",
    "the phase estimation is a procedure of measuring an certain unknown phase with high precision , which is also the key ingredient for resolving some complex quantum algorithms @xcite , e.g. factoring problem and order - finding problem .",
    "therefore quantum phase estimation is a very important tool in quantum communication and quantum computation .    in order to estimate an unknown phase @xmath0 ( @xmath1)$ ]",
    ", we must use an oracle in the process because the phase estimation procedure is not a complete quantum algorithm in its own right . at the same time",
    ", the generation of a state @xmath2 with an eigenvalue @xmath3 is necessary .",
    "in addition , we should also find a unitary transformation @xmath4 , which satisfies @xmath5 controlled unitary transformations @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) will be performed in the process of the oracle @xcite .",
    "the main elements of quantum phase estimation are the oracle transformation and a inverse qft , the sketch of which is shown in fig .",
    "the no.1 register contains @xmath8 qubits initially prepared in the state @xmath9 while the eigenstate @xmath2 was encoded into no.2 register .",
    "the detailed process of phase estimation can be described as following : firstly , perform a hadamard gate operation on each of the @xmath8 qubits in no.1 register .",
    "secondly , apply appropriate @xmath6 operations on the whole system with the @xmath8 qubits in the no.1 register used as controlled bits while @xmath2 as target bit . then apply a inverse qft on the qubits in no.1 register . finally , measure",
    "the output of no.1 register . according to the measurement result",
    ", we can estimate the unknown phase @xmath10 . the successful probability and the number of digits of accuracy we wish to have in the estimation",
    "are depend on @xmath8 .",
    "recently , many researches on phase estimation have been presented including the lower bound for phase estimation @xcite , optimal phase estimation for qubits in mixed states @xcite , optimal phase measurements with pure gaussian states @xcite and optimal quantum circuits for general phase estimation @xcite .",
    "however , the implementation of quantum phase estimation in physical systems is not a easy task since an unknown phase is involved in the procedure . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we can introduce a fungible magnitude @xmath11 into the procedure of phase estimation .",
    "solid - state system would be the best promising candidate for quantum computer considered by scientists .",
    "recently one of the solid - state systems quantum dot system attracts much attention because of its intrinsic properties . in the realm of quantum dot , electronic charge states @xcite , single - electron spin states @xcite , the spin singlet state and triple states of double electrons @xcite can all be used as qubit to encode quantum information .",
    "especially , schemes combining cavity technology become very useful for quantum information processing because the cavity mode can be used as date - bus for long - distance information transfer or long - distance fast coupling between two arbitrary qubits . in comparison with other transmission medium ,",
    "the parallel operations on two arbitrary different qubits can be more easily realized by using cavity technology .",
    "moreover the spatial separation of electronic charge state can enhance quantum coherent @xcite .",
    "therefore we investigate the implementation of quantum phase estimation via the interaction between weakly coupled double quantum - dot molecules and microcavity in this paper . because we introduce the new fungible magnitude , we can calculate time @xmath11 in terms of the final measurement result , which corresponds to the phase @xmath12",
    ". then we can calculate the error of time comparing with an ideal clock , if the error is within the range of the precision @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) of phase estimation , the error will be neglected , otherwise , the frequency of time should be regulated .",
    "in this section , we discuss a scenario for implementing quantum phase estimation in detail . during this process",
    ", we also can check a timepiece whether it is precise or not by comparing with an ideal timepiece .",
    "is used for the qubit logic state @xmath15 , the excited state @xmath16 for logic state @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is an intermediate state .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are two frequencies of pulse lasers , and @xmath21 is the frequency of cavity photon .",
    "( b ) @xmath22 quantum - dot molecules are embedded in a microcavity .",
    "assume that the distance between two neighboring quantum - dot molecules is large enough to neglect coulomb correlations . ]    in our scheme , we use electronic charge ( electron - hole pair ) states to store information , the configuration diagram of a qubit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) .",
    "the state @xmath23 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 are resulted from the conduction and valence band states of the two individual quantum dots with different sizes @xcite .",
    "all of the quantum - dot molecules are embedded in a microcavity .",
    "assume that there is no intermediate state between the two lowest conduction and the highest valance band state .",
    "if we perform a pulse laser on a coupled double quantum - dot molecule with frequency @xmath19 , the rabi transition @xmath24 can be governed by the following interaction hamiltonian ( @xmath25 ) @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the rabi frequency , and @xmath28 is the laser phase . we can obtain the evolution after a duration time @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    from which we can realize arbitrary single - qubit transformations by adjusting @xmath27 , @xmath29 and @xmath28 .",
    "if we switch on a pulse laser with frequency @xmath32 , then the @xmath20 laser photon and the @xmath21 cavity photon will participate a resonant transition @xmath33 , the interaction hamiltonian can be written as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 ; @xmath36 is the detuning between laser frequency and transition energy from @xmath23 to @xmath16 during this transition ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the coupling strengths between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "there is no occupation on the intermediate state @xmath18 because of the existing large detuning @xmath41 .",
    "we can obtain the time evolution corresponding to @xmath42 as    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    this process of evolution is the essential ingredient to realized arbitrary two - qubit operations in this system , such as controlled - not gate @xcite and controlled - phase - flip , where the photonic state ( @xmath47 or @xmath48 ) is used to mediate the coupling between arbitrary two qubits .      to implement quantum phase estimation ,",
    "we prepare two clocks ( clock 1 is a precise one , the frequency of clock 2 is unknown but it s scale is well - proportioned ) , a vacuum microcavity mode state @xmath47 , and @xmath49 coupled double quantum - dot molecules without excess electron in their conduction bands , where @xmath8 molecules are all initialized in @xmath50 , and the @xmath51th molecule is in @xmath52 .",
    "the detailed scenario for implementing general quantum phase estimation can be described as the following in three steps :    \\(i ) firstly , perform a hadamard gate operation on each of the quantum - dot molecules from molecule 1 to molecule @xmath8 , respectively , which can be realized by the interaction as that in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . here",
    "we choose @xmath53 and @xmath54 , ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the time @xmath29 is detected by clock 1 .",
    "then we should perform a controlled phase @xmath56 gate on quantum - dot molecules @xmath8 and @xmath49 ( molecule @xmath8 is used as control bit while molecule @xmath49 as target bit ) by the interaction as that in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "however , molecule @xmath49 is remain in the state @xmath17 at all time , so we only need to operate a single - qubit @xmath0 phase gate on molecule @xmath8 to achieve above task ( @xmath56 gate ) by using the interaction as that in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) by choosing @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( the @xmath0 is unknown and can be controlled by an unknown length @xmath59 of an electro - optic crystal , so it also can be controlled by the time @xmath11 of going through the electro - optic crystal ) .",
    "the time @xmath11 is detected by clock 2 .",
    "similarly , we perform _ 2 _ times @xmath0 phase transformations on molecule @xmath60 , perform _ 4 _ times @xmath0 phase transformations on molecule @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and perform _ @xmath63 _ times @xmath0 phase transformations on molecule 1 .",
    "after that , the state of total system becomes @xmath64",
    "\\(ii ) setting @xmath65 , assume that @xmath66 can be expressed exactly in @xmath8 qubits , so @xmath67 ( @xmath68 or @xmath69 ) , where @xmath70 .",
    "the state of quantum - dot molecules from molecule @xmath69 to molecule @xmath8 can be rewritten as @xmath71 then perform a inversed qft on the no.1 register , the detailed process can be described as following .",
    "( 1 ) we perform a hadamard transform on quantum - dot molecule 1 , the state of quantum - dot molecule 1 becomes @xmath72 .",
    "( 2 ) we perform a series of operations on quantum - dot molecules 1 and 2 : we perform a single - qubit @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) phase gate operation on quantum - dot molecule 1 , a controlled - not gate operation on quantum - dot molecules 1 and 2 ( molecule 1 is used as control bit while molecule 2 as target bit ) , a single - qubit @xmath75 phase gate operation on molecule 2 , a controlled - not gate operation on quantum - dot molecules 1 and 2 again , and a single - qubit @xmath73 phase gate operation on molecule 2 .",
    "these operations on molecules 1 and 2 can be expressed by a total transformation @xmath76 .",
    "then we perform a hadamard transform on quantum - dot molecule 2 .",
    "the state of quantum - dot molecule 2 becomes @xmath77 .",
    "( 3 ) similarly , we apply the transformation @xmath78 on molecules 1 and 3 with @xmath79 , and the transformation @xmath80 on molecules 2 and 3 with @xmath74 as the step ( 2 ) .",
    "then we perform a hadamard transform on quantum - dot molecule 3 .",
    "the state of quantum - dot molecule 2 becomes @xmath81 ; @xmath62 ; ( m ) we apply the transformation @xmath82 on molecules 1 and @xmath8 with @xmath83 , the transformation @xmath84 on molecules 2 and @xmath8 with @xmath85 , @xmath62 , and the transformation @xmath86 on molecules @xmath60 and @xmath8 with @xmath74 as the step ( 2 ) .",
    "finally , we perform a hadamard transformation on quantum - dot molecule @xmath8 .",
    "the state of quantum - dot molecule @xmath8 becomes @xmath87 .",
    "\\(iii ) we detect the quantum - dot molecules 1 , 2 , @xmath62 , @xmath8 by detectors , and read out the result in reversed order .",
    "the measurement result is @xmath88 , but readout is @xmath89 , so the estimated phase @xmath90 , which is precise .      in above process , we have assumed that @xmath66 can be expressed exactly in @xmath91 qubits , but it is only an ideal case .",
    "for an arbitrary value of @xmath66 , and @xmath92 , if we wish to approximate @xmath66 up to an accuracy of @xmath93 , then the successful probability should be about @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "the unknown phase @xmath66 can be created by modulating the length @xmath96 of an electro - optic crystal ( such as kdp crystal ) , so we can estimate the time @xmath11 in terms of @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the frequency of electric field , @xmath99 is electro - optic tensor , @xmath100 is the velocity of laser through the electro - optic crystal , and @xmath22 and @xmath101 are refractive rates for vacuum and electro - optic crystal , respectively . in the process of implementing phase estimation , the time @xmath11 is detected by clock 2 ,",
    "if the clock 2 undergoes @xmath102 scales of total @xmath103 scales , we can calculate the total time by @xmath104 around a circle in clock 2 . in the ideal case",
    ", we compare the @xmath105 with the time @xmath106 around a circle for the idea clock .",
    "if @xmath107 , clock 2 is an accurate one , otherwise , the frequency of clock 2 should be regulated . in the general case",
    ", we should first determinate the error of phase @xmath108 , then we can calculate the error @xmath109 of clock 2 . if @xmath110 , we can treat clock 2 as an accurate one , otherwise , the frequency of clock 2 has to be regulated . in the case of @xmath111 , the frequency of clock 2",
    "should be increased , otherwise , the frequency should be decreased . in a word ,",
    "calibrate of timepiece includes two aspects : one is checking whether the clock 2 is precise or not , the other is if the clock 2 is not precise , we will regulate the frequency of clock 2 according to the error of estimated phase .",
    "similarly , we also can estimate the length @xmath59 of electro - optic crystal based on the procedure of quantum phase estimation .",
    "we then discuss the feasibility of the current scheme with experimental parameters reported in current experiments . for general",
    "weakly coupled double quantum - dot molecule , the coupling strength @xmath29 between @xmath16 and @xmath18 is about @xmath112 , and the energy difference @xmath113 is about @xmath114 , thus the spatial separation factor @xmath115 @xcite . in our scheme ,",
    "we use two laser pluses with different coupling strength @xmath27 , @xmath37 , which will satisfy the condition @xmath116 according to the above value of @xmath117 . for the process of the interaction involves two photons ,",
    "the coupling strength @xmath38 caused by cavity field is @xmath118 @xcite , where we have assumed that @xmath119 and @xmath120 as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , resulting in @xmath121 and @xmath122 . therefore completion of a single - qubit operation and a two - qubit operation will cost about several hundreds nanosecond and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "we can calculate the total time for completing the current scheme , which is about @xmath124 .",
    "the coherent time of the spatial separate charge qubits can reach tens of second @xcite ( we can assume @xmath125 ) . comparing the time @xmath11 with @xmath126 , it is shown that the number of qubit will be @xmath127 if @xmath128 ,",
    "so our scheme is suitable for large - scale quantum computation in quantum dot system .    in conclusion , we present a scenario for implementing general quantum phase estimation via weakly coupled double quantum - dot molecules embedded in a microcavity .",
    "the involved two quantum dots are not necessarily to be exactly identical , which reduces the experimental difficulty . in the same process of our implementation of quantum phase estimation",
    ", we can also realize the calibration of timepiece or estimation of length .",
    "the key ingredient for our scheme is to implement the @xmath56 transformation and the reversed qft .",
    "in addition , the error of time ( length ) can be calculated by the fidelity of quantum phase .",
    "in other words , arbitrary classical quantity related to the estimated quantum phase can be estimated by the same method . these classical estimation results ( time @xmath11 , length @xmath59 , _ et al _ ) are useful for our lives .",
    "the phase estimation would be also an important step for fabricating quantum computer since it is the key ingredient for complex quantum algorithms .",
    "it also deserves to note that our idea can be generalized to other systems , such as atom system , trapped ion system and linear optic system .",
