    "recent observations of the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have provided us with a record of impressive solar eruptions .",
    "these eruptions are mostly associated with coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "these are events through which the sun sheds hot plasma and magnetic fields from the corona into the interplanetary space .",
    "the energy causing such huge eruptions is stored in the magnetic field and can be released _ via _ reconnection of field lines @xcite .",
    "some of the cmes are directed towards the earth , hitting its magnetosphere and causing phenomena like aurorae .",
    "furthermore , encounters with cmes can cause sudden outages of gps signals due to ionospheric scintillation .",
    "the resulting radiation dose from such events poses risks to astronauts .",
    "this is now also of concern to airlines , because the radiation load during polar flights can reach annual limits , especially for pregnant women .",
    "this leads to great interest of scientists in many fields of physics .",
    "however , there is an additional motivation which comes along with space weather effects .",
    "the solar dynamo , which is broadly believed to be responsible for the generation of the solar magnetic field , needs to be sustained by shedding magnetic helicity from the sun s interior @xcite .",
    "mean - field and direct numerical simulations have shown that the magnetic field generation is catastrophically quenched at high magnetic reynolds numbers in closed systems @xcite that do not allow magnetic helicity fluxes out of the domain @xcite , or between different parts of it @xcite .",
    "the magnetic reynolds number , which quantifies the relative importance of advective to diffusive terms in the induction equation , is known to be very large in the sun , therefore implying the possibility of catastrophic quenching in models of the solar dynamo , unless efficient magnetic helicity fluxes occur , for example through cmes @xcite .",
    "indeed , cmes are well known to be closely associated with magnetic helicity @xcite",
    ". in particular observations @xcite and a recent study by @xcite , where the observations are compared with numerical models , suggest that cmes have a twisted magnetic structure , implying that cmes transport helicity outwards",
    ".    there has been significant progress in the study of cmes in recent years .",
    "in addition to improved observations from spacecrafts , _",
    "e.g. _ sdo or the _ solar terestical relation observatory _ ( stereo : * ? ? ? * ) ) , there have also been major advances in the field of numerical modeling of cme events @xcite .",
    "however , the formation and the origin of eruptive events like cmes is not yet completely understood . simulating cmes and their formation is challenging . leaving the difficulties of modeling the interplanetary space aside , a cme , after being ejected into the chromosphere or the lower corona , travels over an extended radial distance to the upper corona . in this environment ,",
    "density and temperature vary by several orders of magnitude , which is not easy to handle in numerical models .",
    "additionally , the origin of the cmes is assumed to relate to the magnetic fields and the velocity pattern at the surface .",
    "however , the surface magnetic and velocity fields are rooted in the solar convection zone , where convective motions , in interplay with differential rotation , generate the magnetic field and the velocity patterns that are observed at the surface .",
    "the majority of researchers modeling cmes do not include the convection zone in their setup , and thereby neglect the effect of the magnetic and velocity fields being rooted to this layer .",
    "often the initial conditions for the magnetic and velocity fields are prescribed or taken from 2d observations ; see for example @xcite and @xcite as well as @xcite .",
    "another approach is to study the emergence of flux ropes from the lower convection zone into the corona . in the presence of strong shear",
    ", convection simulations have been showing the formation of flux tubes @xcite , but such structures are similar to vortex tubes whose diameter is known to relate with the visco - resistive scale @xcite .",
    "in other approaches flux ropes are inserted in a self - consistent model , but their origin is left unexplained . in several recent papers @xcite ,",
    "the focus lies on the emergence of magnetic flux and the resulting features in the solar atmosphere .",
    "however , eruptive events have not been investigated with this setup . in earlier work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wb ) a different approach was developed .",
    "the solar convection zone was combined with a simple model of the solar corona . the magnetic field , which was here generated by dynamo action beneath the solar surface , emerged through the surface and was ejected out of the domain .",
    "the focus was on the connection of the dynamo - generated field and eruptive events like cmes through the dynamo - generated twist .",
    "wb used a simplified coronal model and drove the dynamo with forced turbulence .",
    "these simplifications allowed them to study the emergence and a new mechanism to drive ejections in great detail . in subsequent work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wbm ) , the setup of wb was improved by using a spherical coordinate system and helical forcing with opposite signs in each hemisphere to mimic the effects of rotation on inhomogeneous turbulence .",
    "in addition , wbm included the stratification resulting from radial gravity for an isothermal fluid . to improve this model",
    ", we now employ convection to generate the velocity field . in a related approach ,",
    "@xcite considered convective overshoot into the chromosphere and the excitation of gravity waves therein , but dynamo - generated twist seemed to be unimportant in their work .",
    "the turbulent motions driving the generation of magnetic field are now self - consistently generated by convective cells operating beneath the surface .",
    "the setup of the convection zone follows ideas of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are other approaches simulating convection in hot massive stars , which have thin subsurface convection zones @xcite .",
    "but we now use an extended cooling layer to describe some properties of a solar corona .",
    "the results of this work complement those of earlier work and can be compared with observations .",
    "the model of the solar atmosphere is still a very simplified one , but can be regarded as a preliminary step , which will provide a reference point for improved work in that direction .",
    "as in wb and wbm , a two - layer model is used , which represents the convection zone and an extended corona - like layer in one and the same model .",
    "our convection zone is similar to those of @xcite .",
    "the domain is a segment of the sun and is described in spherical polar coordinates @xmath2 .",
    "we model the convection zone starting at radius @xmath3 and the solar corona until @xmath4 , where @xmath5 in the present models , where @xmath6 corresponds to the solar radius . in the latitudinal direction",
    ", our domain extends in colatitude from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and in the azimuthal direction from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "we solve the following equations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics : @xmath11 where the magnetic field is given by @xmath12 and thus obeys @xmath13 at all times , @xmath14 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the magnetic diffusivity and kinematic viscosity , respectively , @xmath17 is the advective time derivative , @xmath18 is the density , and @xmath19 is the velocity .",

    "the fluid obeys the ideal gas law , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume , respectively , and @xmath30 is the internal energy density , which defines the temperature @xmath31 .",
    "the cooling term @xmath32 will be explained in equation  ( [ cool ] ) below in more detail .      for the thermal stratification in the convection zone",
    ", we consider a simple analytical setup instead of profiles from solar structure models as in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic temperature gradient is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radially varying polytropic index , for which we assume a stepwise constant profile .",
    "we also use equation  ( [ gradt ] ) as the lower boundary condition for the temperature .",
    "this gives the logarithmic temperature gradient @xmath35 ( familiar to those working in stellar physics , but not to be confused with the operator @xmath36 ) as @xmath37 the stratification is convectively unstable if @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the adiabatic temperature gradient , corresponding to @xmath40 for unstable stratification .",

    "we show the initial non - convecting stratification . the radial temperature gradient at the bottom of the domain is set to a constant value , which leads to a constant heat flux into the domain . in the coronal part",
    "the gradient goes smoothly to @xmath48 by using the @xmath49 dependent cooling function @xmath32 , which is included in the entropy evolution ( [ entro ] ) .",
    "the cooling term is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a profile function equal to unity in @xmath52 and smoothly connecting to zero in @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is a cooling luminosity chosen so that the sound speed in the coronal part relaxes towards @xmath55 .",
    "whether the stratification is convectively stable or not depends on the brunt  visl frequency @xmath56 , defined through @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the pressure scale height . if @xmath59 is negative , the stratification is unstable .",
    "we initialize the magnetic field as a weak , random , gaussian - distributed seed field in the whole domain . in the coronal part",
    "the magnetic field diffuses after a short time .",
    "we do not use a background coronal field , so the field is self - consistently generated by the dynamo in the convective layer .",
    "we apply periodic boundary conditions in the azimuthal direction over a @xmath60 fraction of the full circumference . for the velocity we take stress - free boundary conditions on all other boundaries . as in wbm ,",
    "the stress - free boundary conditions prevent mass flux , so no stellar wind is possible . because no mass can escape , material will eventually fall back from the boundary .",
    "thermodynamic variables have zero gradients at the latitudinal boundaries .",
    "we employ perfect conductor boundaries for the magnetic field at the latitudinal and at the lower radial boundaries , and radial field conditions at the outer radial boundary .",
    "the latter is motivated by the fact that in the sun , the solar wind pushes the magnetic field to open field lines and at a radius of @xmath61 solar radii .",
    "the field lines are mostly radial @xcite .",
    "this choice has been substantiated by subsequent work of @xcite as well as @xcite .",
    "while this choice might still be too restrictive for coronal holes and coronal streamers , and given also that our radial extent in most of the simulations is smaller than @xmath62 , we nevertheless choose the vertical field boundary condition because it satisfies our primary objective of letting magnetic helicity leave the domain , which is believed to be crucial for the dynamo to operate at large values of @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "however , we must be aware of the fact that with this choice our description of the field in the exterior layer is not a realistic one .",
    "to describe the corona as an isothermal extended cooling layer is a serious simplification , in that the temperature inside the coronal layer is not higher than in the convection zone as in a real stellar corona , but it stays fixed at the surface value ; see figure  [ strat ] .",
    "besides the fact that a simple cooling layer is easy to handle numerically , we emphasize the importance of facilitating comparison with previous models of wbm .",
    "it can also be seen as a step towards studying effects that are not solely due to a low plasma @xmath64 corona , for which the magnetic pressure , _ i.e. _ the magnetic field , is strong compared with the gas pressure ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "indeed , given that our initial field is weak , the plasma @xmath64 is necessarily large in the outer parts .",
    "we note that it is not even clear whether a hot corona promotes or hinders coronal ejections . to understand the formation and evolution of magnetic ejections , studies that isolate these effects , such as the present one , may be important .",
    "we use the pencil code with sixth - order centered finite differences in space and a third - order accurate runge  kutta scheme in time ; see @xcite for the extension of the pencil code to spherical coordinates .",
    "we use a grid size of @xmath66 mesh points ( runs  a5 and ar1 ) , and @xmath67 ( run  a5a ) .      whether the solar corona rotates like a solid body or differentially coupled with the photosphere is unclear . in recent work by @xcite , where soho - eit data of the bright points in the solar corona were used to estimate the rotation speeds",
    ", it was found that the corona rotates similarly as the small magnetic features in the photosphere .",
    "similar results have been obtained by @xcite , where the coronal rotation has been measured by analyzing the green fe@xmath68 530.3 nm line .",
    "this author finds also a variation pattern with the activity cycle .",
    "however , the observations of the `` boot '' coronal hole by skylab suggested rigid rotation @xcite .",
    "recent work on coronal holes by @xcite claims that the rigid rotation is only an apparent one .",
    "the magnetic field is sheared by the differential rotation , but the boundary of the hole remains relatively unchanged , due to reconnection .",
    "owing to the low plasma @xmath64 in the solar corona , the fluid motions are dominated by the magnetic fields whose footpoints are anchored in the photosphere or even further down .",
    "so the magnetic field might then be rigid enough to prevent differential rotation of the solar corona .",
    "however , the observed bright points and other features in the corona are strongly correlated with the magnetic field so they can give a misleading picture about the global rotation of the corona .    in our simulations ,",
    "the coriolis force is included in the momentum equation as a consequence of the rotation . in the solar corona",
    "the density is more than 14 orders of magnitude smaller than in the lower convection zone . because of the weak density stratification in our simulation ,",
    "the coriolis force in our coronal part is too strong and can cause possible artifacts such as the magnetorotational instability . to avoid this  at least for runs with rapid rotation ",

    "only three have been discussed in this paper , only a small fraction of events can be identified with actual coronal ejections similar to the ones seen in wb and wbm . especially the runs  a5 and ar1 show some clear ejection events . there",
    "the magnetic field emerges out of the convection zone and is ejected as an isolated structure . in figure  [ jb ]",
    "we have plotted the normalized current helicity , @xmath130 , as a time series for run  a5 . at small scales ,",
    "the current helicity density , @xmath131 , is a good proxy for magnetic helicity density , @xmath132 , and is , as opposed to the latter , gauge invariant .",
    "in addition , the current helicity can be an indicator of helical magnetic structures , which are believed to be present in coronal mass ejections @xcite .",
    "close to the equator a bipolar structure emerges through the surface .",
    "the inner bulk has a positive current helicity , in figure  [ jb ] represented by a yellow color , and it pushes an arc with negative current helicity ahead of it ; see figure  [ eje ] .",
    "such bipolar ejections have been identified in earlier work ( wbm ) and compared with the ` three - part structure ' of coronal mass ejection , which is described in @xcite .",
    "the three parts consist of a prominence , which is similar to the bulk seen in our simulations , a front with an arc shaped structure corresponding to our arc , and a cavity between these two features .",
    "a bipolarity of twisted magnetic field has also been seen in observed magnetic clouds by @xcite . even though the domain of the simulation is larger in the @xmath95 direction than in wbm , the ejections are much smaller , which is actually closer to the cmes observed on the sun . in the work of wbm",
    "the ejections have a size that corresponds to about 500 mm , whereas in this work they seems to have a size corresponding to around 100 mm if scaled to the solar radius .",
    "the ejections seem to expand slightly , but no significant expansion rate can be measured using this resolution . comparing with the forced turbulence runs , the difference in size is mostly due to the more complex and fluctuating magnetic field in convection runs . in the sequence of images of figure  [ eje ] , an ejection near the equator reaches the outer boundary and leaves the domain .",
    "to investigate the mechanism driving the ejection , we look at the dynamics of the magnetic field in figure  [ eje ] , where field lines of the azimuthally averaged mean field are shown as contours of @xmath133 , and colors represent @xmath134 together with the density fluctuations and current helicity . during the ejection ,",
    "one may notice a strong concentration of magnetic field lines that are directed radially outwards .",
    "this concentration appears first beneath the surface and then emerges below the current helicity structure and follows it up into the coronal part . investigating the direction of field lines of the mean field in the time series in figure  [ eje ] , an x - point can be found . in the first panel , at @xmath135 and @xmath136 ,",
    "the magnetic field lines form a junction - like shape .",
    "the dotted line represents a counter - clockwise oriented field loop , so at the two corners of the junction there are field lines with opposite signs .",
    "after around 14 turnover times this `` junction '' has reconnected at the same position as where the ejection is detected .",
    "it appears that these two events are related to each other .",
    "looking at the magnetic field line in the @xmath49,@xmath74 plane , which here is _ not _ averaged over the perpendicular direction ( figure  [ eje_phi ] ) , we identify a structure which has a shape similar to an x - point .",
    "the ejection causes also a strong variation in the density .",
    "if the time - averaged density profile is subtracted from instantaneous ones , the density fluctuations are obtained . after removing the density stratification",
    "one obtains @xmath137 .",
    "we plot these density fluctuations , @xmath138 , in the right column of figure  [ eje ] to visualize the effect of the ejection on the density .",
    "the density in the ejection is much lower than in the rest of the coronal part .",
    "however , the density variations are also associated with fluctuations in the specific entropy ( @xmath139 ) , which suggests that thermal buoyancy also plays a role .",
    "one interpretation could be that the strong magnetic field reduces the density to achieve total pressure equilibrium and the ejection rises partly because of magnetic buoyancy .",
    "such an effect is also seen by inspecting other ejections .    to characterize the emergence we plot different properties of the ejection in the @xmath95,@xmath74 plane",
    "; see figure  [ eje_pt ] .",
    "the magnetic field shows a strong concentration in its radial and azimuthal components .",
    "the concentration is associated with a downflow in spite of it being a low - density region .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this case the gas velocity does not reflect the actual pattern speed . from the time evolution of the low - density region shown in fig .",
    "[ eje ] , we know that this region is moving radially upwards in a way that is consistent with a motion expected from buoyancy forces",
    ". in particular , the specific entropy has a high value in this region . in visualizations of the current density",
    ", we see the formation of two current sheets .",
    "this leads to two current helicity regions of opposite sign .",
    "when discussing coronal ejections , one is usually interested in the plasma @xmath64 parameter to characterize the corona . in our simplified coronal part",
    ", the plasma @xmath64 does not decrease with radius , but it stays rather high , which is due to the low magnetic field strength , especially in the coronal part , even though @xmath1400.10.4 in the convection zone .",
    "the time - averaged value is always above @xmath141 , and is therefore not comparable with the values in the solar corona , where the plasma @xmath64 is very low because of the low density .",
    "there the magnetic field can drag dense plasma from the lower corona to its upper part . in our simulations",
    "the density stratification of the convection zone is much lower than in the sun .",
    "therefore , the density in the corona in our model is much higher and is closer to the density of the photosphere or the chromosphere .",
    "a rising magnetic flux tube has formed a low - density region in its interior due to a higher magnetic pressure . as the tube rises further into the coronal part ,",
    "the density inside the tube is still lower than that outside because the coronal density is rather high in our model .",
    "the simplification of a high plasma @xmath64 corona might not be suitable to describe properly the mass flux of the plasma dragged by the magnetic field of the cme in the corona .",
    "however , the early work of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite has shown that an isothermal force - free approach ( not to be confused with force - free magnetic equilibria ) can describe the coronal magnetic field and even plasmoid ejections rather well .",
    "note that in those papers the pressure gradient term was omitted , just like in the coronal part of wb .",
    "how important this really is remains unclear , because the pressure gradient term was not omitted in the work of wbm , which still showed ejections similar to those of wb .",

    "others follow in a recurrent fashion . however , the periodicity is not as clear as in previous work ( wb , wbm ) . for run  a5 ,",
    "for example , we observe around five ejections during a time interval of about @xmath147 turnover times .",
    "a clearer indication for the recurrence of the ejections can be seen in figure  [ pjb ] , where the normalized current density is averaged over two narrow latitude bands in each hemisphere .",
    "the slope of structures in the outer parts in these @xmath148 diagrams gives an indication about the ejection speed @xmath149 which turns out to be around one solar radius in 200250 turnover times .",
    "this translates to @xmath150 , which is somewhat less than the values 0.20.5 found for the simulations of wbm .",
    "however , the mechanism which sets the time scale of ejections is at present still unclear .    given that gravity decreases with radius , there is in principle the possibility of a radial wind with a critical point at @xmath151 @xcite , which would be at @xmath152 , i.e.  well outside our coronal part . because of this and the fact that we use closed boundary conditions with no mass flux out of the domain",
    ", no such wind can occur in our simulations . using a boundary condition that would allow a mass flux in the radial direction could change the speed and the ejection properties significantly . including a solar - like wind in a model can have two major effects , which require a much higher amount of computational resources .",
    "the radial variation of gravity applied in these simulations implies the presence of a critical point rather close to the surface of the convection zone .",
    "therefore , if a wind were to develop , the resulting velocity in the convection zone would be too high for a dynamo to develop ; the magnetic field would be blown out too quickly .",
    "using instead a more realistic profile for the solar wind with a position of the critical point around @xmath153 , the corresponding density stratification would be too strong to be stably resolved .",
    "in the present paper we have presented an extension of the two - layer approach of wb and wbm by including a self - consistent rotating convection zone into the model .",
    "we find a large - scale magnetic field generated by the convective turbulent motion in the convection zone . at moderate rotation rates , for a coriolis number larger than 3 , we obtain a differential rotation pattern showing super - rotation , i.e. , an equator rotating faster than the poles .",
    "the dynamo solutions we find are different and some of them have a periodic oscillatory behavior , where the large - scale magnetic field does not change sign ; only the strength is varying . at the maxima ,",
    "the velocity is suppressed due to the backreaction via the lorentz force .",
    "small - scale magnetic structures seem to show an equatorward migration near the equator and a poleward one near the poles .",
    "using a convectively driven dynamo complicates the generation of ejections into a coronal part due to lower relative kinetic helicity . however , it was possible to produce ejections in two of the runs . the shape and the bipolar helicity structure are comparable with those of wbm . due to the relatively high plasma @xmath64 in the outer parts of our model ( compared with the solar corona ) ,",
    "the ejections produce local minima of density which are carried along and ejected out to the top of the domain .",
    "the ejections occur recurrently , but not clearly periodically , which is similar to the sun .",
    "note that our results have to be interpreted cautiously , given the use of a simplistic solar atmosphere .",
    "we neglect the effects of high temperature and low plasma @xmath64 .",
    "however , we feel that the mechanism of emergence of magnetic structures driven by dynamo action from self - consistent convection may not strongly depend on these two conditions .",
    "this suggestion has to be proven in more detail in forthcoming work .",
    "an extension of the present work would require a detailed parameter study of cause and properties of the ejections .",
    "this also includes an advanced model for the solar corona with a lower plasma @xmath64 and more efficient convection , which has a stronger stratification and is cooled by radiation .",
    "another important aspect would be the generation of a self - consistent solar wind which supports and interacts with the ejections .",

    "<S> we combine a convectively driven dynamo in a spherical shell with a nearly isothermal density - stratified cooling layer that mimics some aspects of a stellar corona to study the emergence and ejections of magnetic field structures . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is an extension of earlier models , where forced turbulence simulations were employed to generate magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> a spherical wedge is used which consists of a convection zone and an extended coronal region to @xmath0 times the radius of the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the wedge contains a quarter of the azimuthal extent of the sphere and @xmath1 in latitude . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is self - consistently generated by the turbulent motions due to convection beneath the surface . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic fields are found to emerge at the surface and are ejected to the coronal part of the domain . </S>",
    "<S> these ejections occur at irregular intervals and are weaker than in earlier work . </S>",
    "<S> we tentatively associate these events with coronal mass ejections on the sun , even though our model of the solar atmosphere is rather simplistic . </S>"
