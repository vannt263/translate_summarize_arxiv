    "e - commerce and social - media offer their users facilities to buy , review , sell and share online items , such as amazon , e - bay , facebook and tencent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tencent_qq[qq ] .",
    "the adoption of social media is increasing by day and night so as e - commerce .",
    "because of its widely adoption , it is gaining attention of the organizations , to know people s demand and trend.researchers have also found correlation between social media and e - commerce industry .",
    "social media is showing a great opportunity by carrying huge amount of user generated data for exploiting and finding the outcome of interest ( asur , huberman , and others 2010 ) . in e - commerce site , organizations are directly interested what are the response from users , for their products .",
    "they also want to know which kind of item will be in demand so that they can make profit . since the number of products are expanding constantly so online merchants changes their strategies from traditional marketing advertisement ( like tv , news paper etc ) to viral marketing , i.e.  customers are suggested to share the product information with their friends on social media such as facebook and twitter ( leskovec , adamic , and huberman 2007 ) . from infotainment to trade , everything is done on internet and online contents have become valuable internet asset ( tatar et al .",
    "2014 ) that is useful to producers and consumers both , hence to know the future popularity of online content has become an important area of attention and interest .",
    "popularity prediction is a complex task depending on different factors like quality and individual s interest.content popularity may fluctuate with time ( eisler , bartos , and kertesz 2008 ) , increase over time or be limited within communities .",
    "it is difficult to capture the relationship between real world event and web content , in the prediction model for example during indian election many joke goes viral and they might not explicity inlude the political symbol.some contents get extreme popularity because of its prior popularity , also known as _ cascading effect _ ( cheng et al .",
    "2014 ) , and it becomes hard to predict which content will stop this cascading effect . in presence of cascading effect other `` potential items '' ( exhibit a sudden increase of popularity at a certain duration of time ,",
    "i.e.  can be popular , but not now ) are suppressed.most recently researchers have found that the popularity of online contents like news , blog posts , videos , mobile app download ( gleeson et al . 2014 ) in online discussion forums and product reviews exhibits temporal dynamics .",
    "it turns out that user interests toward web items , vary with time ; an extensive study of how the popularity of online media s temporal patterns grow and fade , over time are presented in ( yang and leskovec 2011 ) , ( leskovec , backstrom , and kleinberg 2009 ) . besides the works on temporal scale",
    ", other researchers found that the contents popularity is influenced significantly by consumers social relationship ( zeng et al .",
    "2013 ) , ( szabo and huberman 2015 ) , the social network of consumer can enhance the prediction performance ; and social dynamics of consumer , influence the social media content s popularity even more significantly . because the models of both temporal dynamics and social dynamics are always complex and parameterized , it is hard to apply those models to real online systems .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we formally defined problem . in section 3",
    "we introduced the baseline method .",
    "insection 4 we proposed new method to solve the problem . in section 5",
    "we discuss the mthods and materials for experiment and we also discuss insights from the results.in section 6 we have concluded the paper with possible future works .",
    "in our model we have considered the bipartite network which consists of a set of users ( @xmath0 ) and a set of objects ( @xmath1 ) . the popularity of a node or item or object is the total link recieved by the object ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "a bipartite network can be represented by an adjacency matrix @xmath3 , if user @xmath4 , ( @xmath5 ) have consumed object @xmath2 , ( @xmath6 ) . to consider the temporal effect on objects final popularity we take snapshots of the network at different time point .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the adjecency matrix of the snap - shotted network at time @xmath8 , then matrix ( @xmath7 ) containes edges between user ( @xmath4 ) and object ( @xmath2 ) before time ( @xmath8 ) only .",
    "the user and object degree can be computed by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively.@xmath11 is future time window , so popularity or increment in degree of an object @xmath2 is given by-    @xmath12    the popularity prediction problem can be defined as follows . given a data - set s which includes information about ratings by users that have rated or consumed the item / object @xmath2 with time - stamp ( e.g.  user i d , item i d , time ) , after arranging the data - set in ascending order by time , we divided the data - sets into training time t and future time window @xmath11 .",
    "this is obvious that interest towards object , varies with type or category such as online video , object is different than items on amazon .",
    "considering these facts we have chosen the training time @xmath8 that helps us to predict with better accuracy in future time window .",
    "a predictor exploits the information before time ( @xmath8 ) and make prediction for future time window ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xmath13 is the real score of object ( @xmath2 ) . a predictor s performance is measured by calculating it s accuracy by comparing its ranking from predicted ranking and real ranking",
    "we have considered state - of - the art for predicting new entries as a baseline method as for as our knowledge goes .",
    "( zeng et al . 2013 ) has proposed popularity based predictors(pbp ) .",
    "it is based on a well known _",
    "preferential attachment _ theory , which states that popularity increases cumulatively ; the rate of new link ( either item recieves rating in case of movielens , or a friend like or comments in case of facebook wall post activity ) formation for any node is proportional to the observed number of links which node has recieved in past .",
    "if an item is popular at time @xmath14 , then it will probably become popular due to the condition that current degree of an item @xmath15 is a good predictor of its future popularity .",
    "further ( ( gleeson et al . 2014 ) , ( zeng et al . 2013 ) ) have found that current degree is a good predictor of items future popularity.(zeng et al .",
    "2013 ) proposes to calculate the prediction score of an item at time @xmath8 can be given as follows- -    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the rating / links recieved in past time window @xmath18 from @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath19 } $ ] , note that @xmath20 gives the total popularity and for @xmath21 it gives recent popularity .",
    "throught the script by popularity we mean number of ratings or links recieved by item or node .",
    "it is obvious that popularity of any item on social media does nt last forever.in addition decay rate may vary from item to item e.g life cycle of popularity of a movie will be different from news or items on digg or facebook.every type of item have its own decay rate like ( parolo et al .",
    "2015 ) have found research article citation rate decays after some time .",
    "mathew effect or preferential attachement is a well known phenomena seen almost in large scale networks that shows power law distribution ( et.al 1999 ) .",
    "these theories explains that rich will get richer and poor get poorer .    as researchers have found that degree distribution of every network ends up to long tailed.this is also true in case of e - commerce user - item bipartite networks.people chase the popularity of items to optimize their time and energy .",
    "there are good or fit items ( matus medo manuel s. mariani and zhang 2015 ) , ( bianconi and barabsi 2001 ) to be consumed but under the influence of preferential attachment those are ignored . under it",
    "s influence finding the fit or potential item is one of the important tasks among the researchers.researchers have also found that network changes structure due to aging factor over time [ ( h .",
    "zhu , wang , and zhu 2003 ) ] . considering these factors",
    "we propose that the recent gain in popularity as well as decay in popularity together are a good predictor for its future popularity.considering the competing behavior in networks ( bianconi and barabsi 2001),if some items are loosing their populairty then other items should be gaining attentions of the consumer .",
    "therefore decaying factors with recent popularity will help us in detecting `` potantial items '' .",
    "recent popularity is one of the important factors in discovering the final popularity of objects are discussed in ( j .- p .",
    "onnela and reed - tsochas 2010 ) .",
    "we also know that considering all features that affect popularity of content is really a difficult task . if @xmath22 is prediction score at time @xmath8 given past time window @xmath18 .",
    "we can say-    @xmath23    the above equation states that score of object is proportional to recent gain in popularity .",
    "@xmath24 is tunable prameter between recentness and total popularity.it can take values in [ 0,1 ] interval .",
    "as the researchers also found aging phenomina in item or node so we can formulate it as follows-    @xmath25    where @xmath26 denotes the time at which user @xmath4 consumed the object @xmath2 and @xmath27 is free parameter.since recent popularity will be good predictor if decay rate is constant .",
    "so now we can write as follows-    @xmath28    again we can write-    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is normalization constant and can be estimated using following equation @xmath31 .",
    "for testing our proposed predictor s efficiecy we have considered popularity based predictor ( pbp ) as a base predictor by ( zeng et al . 2013 ) .",
    "we took average of 10 results .",
    "three evaluation metrics are adopted to measure the accuracy of the proposed model including _ _ precision__@xmath32,__novelty__@xmath33 and _ area under recieving operating characteristic_(@xmath34 ) .",
    "* _ precision _ is defined as the fraction of objects that are predicted also lie in the top @xmath35 object of true ranking ( herlocker et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of common objects between predicted and real ranking .",
    "@xmath38 is the size of list to be ranked.its value ranges in [ 0,1 ] , higher value of @xmath32 is better .    * _ novelty(@xmath39 ) _ is a metric to measure the ability of a predictor to rank the items in top @xmath38 position that was not in top @xmath38 position in previous time window.we call these new entries as `` potential items '' throughout the script . if we denote the predicted object as ( @xmath40 ) and potential true object as @xmath41 , then the novelty of a model is given by-    @xmath42    * _ auc _ measures the relative position of the predicted item and true ranked items",
    ". suppose predicted item list is ( @xmath43 ) and real item list is ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "if @xmath45 and @xmath46 is score of object in predicted then _ auc _ is given by-    @xmath47    where , @xmath48      to test the predictors accuracy we have used different data sets . like movielens , netflix , facebook wall post datasets etc .",
    "movielens and netflix data sets contain movie ratings and facebook data set contains users wall post relationships .",
    "movielens is provided by link : www.grouplens.org[grouplens ] project at university of minnesota .",
    "the data description can be found on the website.while data preparation for our model we have selected small subset from each by randomly choosing users who have rated atleast @xmath49 movies .",
    "the original rating was in the form of numarical @xmath50 , we have considered the link between the user and object which object have recieved higher than two ratings.for all the three datasets facebook , movielens and netflix the time is considered in days . the data description is as follows-    * * netflix * data contains @xmath51 users,@xmath52 movies and @xmath53 links , data was collected during(1st jan @xmath54 @xmath55 dec 2005 ) . *",

    "we have found that people rely more on the age of the post than the recent behaviours of their friends . while more recent post shared by their friends are more entertained.on facebook not only share or comment on their friend s post but also they can create their own post and other can share or comment.that is why potantial items on facebook , a user not only depends on the age and recent activity of the peers but also node cetrality . who have shared the post",
