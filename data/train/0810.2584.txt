    "since the first detection by @xcite , over 300 extrasolar planets ( or exoplanets ) have been observed .",
    "almost all exoplanets are believed to be gas giant planets , like jupiter and saturn in the solar system , because massive planets are observed preferentially .",
    "although these planets are believed to form in the disk surrounding the central star ( i.e. , the circumstellar disk or protoplanetary disk ) , their formation process is not yet fully understood . under",
    "spherical symmetry , including the radiative effect , the evolution of gas giant planets has been investigated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these studies showed rapid gas accretion onto the protoplanet after the formation of a solid core with @xmath9 .",
    "the gas giant planet acquires a large fraction of its mass in this gas accretion phase . since gas flows into the gravitational sphere ( i.e. , hill sphere ) of the protoplanet with an angular momentum , a circumplanetary disk forms around the protoplanet in this phase .",
    "then , satellites may form in this circumplanetary disk .",
    "regular satellites around a gas giant planet are considered to form according to a scenario similar to the formation of earth - like planets in the solar system : the protosatellite forms by the accumulation through mutual collision of the satellitesimals that forms after the dust grains sink towards the equatorial plane of the circumplanetary disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since regular satellites are considered to be a by - product of gas - planet formation , they provide an important clue for understanding it .",
    "thus , it is necessary to understand the formation of the circumplanetary disk , which is the site of the satellite formation in the framework of gas planet formation .",
    "however , the formation and acquisition process of angular momentum in the circumplanetary disk can not be understood by spherically symmetric calculations .    in two - dimensional simulations ,",
    "protoplanet evolution was investigated by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) who showed that it is possible for a circumplanetary disk to form around a protoplanet .",
    "they also found prograde rotation of the protoplanetary system ( protoplanet + circumplanetary disk ) against the orbital motion of the planet in the circumstellar disk .",
    "recently , the evolution of a protoplanetary system was calculated in three dimensions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies showed that the gas flow pattern in three dimensions is qualitatively different from that in two dimensions : gas flows into the protoplanet system only in the vertical direction in three - dimensional simulations .",
    "thus , three - dimensional simulations are necessary for investigating the gas flow around the protoplanet , angular momentum of the protoplanet system , and circumplanetary disk formation .",
    "moreover , the circumplanetary disk should be resolved with sufficient spatial resolution , because regular satellites are distributed only in very close proximity to the planet ; the regular satellites of giant planets in the solar system are distributed only in the region of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the radius of the planet . on the other hand",
    ", the radius of the gravitational sphere ( or hill radius ) of the planet extends up to @xmath12 .",
    "for example , the hill radii for jupiter and saturn are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "thus , to investigate a protoplanetary system , we must resolve not only the planetary radius @xmath15 , but also a sufficiently remote region from the hill sphere ( @xmath16 , or @xmath17 ) , requiring the resolution of spatial scales differing by a factor of more than 1000 .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite used the nested - grid method to resolve a wide spatial scale .",
    "although @xcite calculated a protoplanetary system in three dimensions with sufficient spatial resolution , they could not investigate the region near the protoplanet because they adopted a sink cell in the region of @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite calculated the evolution of a protoplanetary system without a sink , and estimated the angular momentum accreted onto the system .",
    "however , they adopted the isothermal approximation .",
    "this approximation is considered to be valid in the circumstellar disk and areas remote from the protoplanet because these regions are optically thin due to their lower gas density . however , this approximation is not valid in the vicinity of the protoplanet , because the gas temperature increases adiabatically as the gas density becomes high @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "the thermal evolution of a protoplanetary system is modelled according to @xcite , and implemented into a three - dimensional nested - grid code .",
    "using such a code , the system is resolved from a sufficient distance from the hill sphere ( @xmath19 ) to the jovian radius ( @xmath20 ) , and the angular momentum flowing into the protoplanetary system and circumplanetary disk are investigated .",
    "in addition , the spatial resolution in this calculation is much higher than those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the calculations show that the angular momentum acquired by the system is independent of the thermal evolution around the protoplanet after the protoplanet grows to @xmath21 .",
    "a thin circumplanetary disk appears only in a compact region near the protoplanet ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the centrifugal radius derived from the angular momentum of the protoplanetary system corresponds well to the region in which the regular satellites of present gaseous planets are distributed .",
    "in addition , the surface density has a peak in this region .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the frameworks of our models are given in  2 , and the numerical method is described in  3 .",
    "the numerical results are presented in  4 .",
    "the discussion of circumplanetary disk and satellite formation is presented in  5 .",
    "in this study , a local region around a protoplanet is considered using the shearing sheet model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , in which the self - gravity of the disk is ignored .",
    "in addition , no physical viscosity is included , and the numerical viscosity can be ignored because it is sufficiently small .",
    "thus , an inviscid gas disk model is adopted here .",
    "the orbit of the protoplanet is assumed to be circular on the equatorial plane of the circumstellar disk .",
    "local rotating cartesian coordinates with the origin at the protoplanet are set up , in which the @xmath23- , @xmath24- , and @xmath25-axis are the radial , azimuthal , and vertical direction of the disk , respectively .",
    "the equations of hydrodynamics without self - gravity are solved : @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the gas density , velocity , gas pressure , effective potential , and keplerian angular velocity of the protoplanet , respectively . for the gas pressure , a barotropic equation of state",
    "is adopted ( for details see  [ sec : eos ] ) . in the above equations ,",
    "the curvature terms are neglected .",
    "the keplerian angular velocity of the protoplanet is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the gravitational constant , mass of the central star , and orbital radius of the protoplanet , respectively .",
    "the effective potential @xmath31 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mass of the protoplanet , and the distance from the centre of the protoplanet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the first term is composed of the gravitational potential of the central star and the centrifugal potential , and higher orders in @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are neglected .",
    "the second term is the gravitational potential of the protoplanet . using the hill radius @xmath40 equation  ( [ eq : phi ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath41      at a fixed orbital radius of the protoplanet , the circumstellar disk has an almost constant temperature @xcite , while the gas around the protoplanet ( i.e. , the gas envelope ) has a higher temperature than the circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the structure and stability of the envelope around the protoplanet , on the assumption that the envelope is spherically symmetric , and in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "they also investigated the thermal evolution of the envelope , parameterising the dust grain opacity , and determined the boundary between the isothermal and adiabatic regions .    to correctly estimate thermal evolution around the protoplanet",
    ", we need to solve the radiation hydrodynamics . however , this has a huge computational cost .",
    "thus , in this study , using figure  2 of @xcite , thermal evolution around the protoplanet is modelled as a function of the gas density ( i.e. , barotropic equation of state ) : @xmath42    + \\kappa \\rho^\\gamma \\ , { \\rm tanh}\\left({{\\displaystyle \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_{\\rm cri } } }   } \\right ) , \\label{eq : eos}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the sound speed , @xmath44 is the adiabatic index ( @xmath45 ) , and the adiabatic constant @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the critical density : the gas behaves isothermally in the region of @xmath49 , and adiabatically in the region of @xmath50 .",
    "in this study , @xmath48 = @xmath51 ( isothermal model ) , 10@xmath52 , 100@xmath52 , and 1000@xmath52 ( adiabatic models ) are adopted , where @xmath52 is the initial density on the equatorial plane . the hyperbolic tangent ( tanh ) function",
    "is used to smoothly connect the first ( isothermal ) and second ( adiabatic ) terms in equation  ( [ eq : eos ] ) .",
    "the thermal evolution for different @xmath48 is plotted against the gas density in figure  [ fig:1 ] , in which the gas temperature is constant in the isothermal model ( @xmath53 ) , while it increases gradually from the initial value at @xmath54 in the adiabatic models ( @xmath48 = 10@xmath52 , 100@xmath52 , and 1000@xmath52 ) .    in the standard disk model @xcite ,",
    "the density and temperature at jovian orbit are @xmath55 and @xmath56k , respectively .",
    "thus , in a model with @xmath57 ( the highest temperature model ) , the gas behaves isothermally when @xmath58 , while it behaves adiabatically when @xmath59 . comparing figure  [ fig:1 ] with figure  2 of @xcite , the thermal evolution of the model with @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] broken line ) corresponds to that for a gas envelope around a proto - jovian planet ( fig.2 of @xcite ) when a gas opacity @xmath61@xmath62g@xmath63 is adopted .",
    "@xcite adopted @xmath64@xmath62g@xmath63 as the most reliable parameter of a proto - jovian planet , indicating that a more realistic gas temperature of the envelope is lower than that in the model with @xmath65 ( the dotted line of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "note that the critical density @xmath48 increases as the gas opacity @xmath66 decreases .",
    "thus , in models with @xmath67 , the thermal energy around the protoplanet may be overestimated . on the other hand ,",
    "when the isothermal equation of state is adopted , the thermal energy around the protoplanet is obviously underestimated .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the actual thermal evolution exists between models with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "this figure indicates that models with higher gas temperature form relatively thick envelopes .",
    "the envelopes of models m1i and m1a3 have a height - to - radius ratio of @xmath157 in the region of @xmath158 , while that of model m1a1 has @xmath159 in the region of @xmath158 ( see , the contours for @xmath160 in fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "however , even in model m1a1 , the envelope in the region of @xmath161 is sufficiently thin ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "thus , a thin disk forms close to the protoplanet in each model , while the protoplanetary systems have different envelope thicknesses in the region far from the protoplanet for models with different equations of state . in adiabatic models ,",
    "since the gas temperature increases with the gas density as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] , the thermal effect is more significant close to the protoplanet . despite this , the structural difference is clearer in the region far from the protoplanet ( i.e. , the low - density region ) .",

    "for example , with a proto - jovian planet ( @xmath188 ) at jovian orbit ( @xmath36=5.2au ) , the protoplanetary system has a specific angular momentum of @xmath189 in equations  ( [ eq : fit ] ) , and @xmath190 in equation  ( [ eq : j - ana ] ) . with a proto - saturnian planet ( @xmath191 ) at saturnian orbit ( @xmath36=9.6au ) , the specific angular momenta are @xmath192 in equation  ( [ eq : fit ] ) , and @xmath193 in equation  ( [ eq : j - ana2 ] ) .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : fit])-([eq : j - ana2 ] ) indicate that the specific angular momentum of a protoplanetary system is determined only by the protoplanet s mass ( or the size of the hill sphere ) at a fixed orbit .",
    "since the gravitational energy dominates the thermal energy inside the hill sphere when @xmath194 at jovian orbit as described in @xcite , the thermal effect can be ignored in the angular momentum acquisition process when the protoplanet s mass is @xmath194 .",
    "thus , it is natural that the angular momentum flowing onto the system is controlled only by the protoplanet s mass .",
    "the resulting angular momentum of the protoplanetary system can be estimated by integrating equation  ( [ eq : fit ] ) using mass up to the present values for gas giant planets . as a result ,",
    "the jovian and saturnian protoplanetary systems have @xmath195 and @xmath196 times larger angular momentum than the present gas giant planet systems ( the central gas giant planet + satellites , for details see * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows the density distribution on the @xmath197 plane ( upper ) and surface density along the @xmath25-axis ( lower ) around proto - jupiter ( left ; model m1a2 ) and proto - saturn ( right ; model m02a2 ) .",
    "model m1a2 ( left panels ) has a parameter of @xmath198 , which corresponds to a jovian mass ( 1@xmath113 ) at jovian orbit ( 5.2au ) , while model m02a2 ( right panels ) has @xmath199 , which corresponds to a saturnian mass ( @xmath200 ) at saturnian orbit ( 9.6au ) .",
    "in addition , these models have @xmath201 , which is the most realistic parameter when a jovian mass is adopted ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since the evolution of protoplanetary systems was calculated in non - dimensional units , the calculation results can be scaled in real units at an arbitrary orbit .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] adopts the units at jovian ( left ) and saturnian ( right ) orbit .",
    "the dotted lines in figure  [ fig:6 ] represent 10 , 30 and 50 times the planet s radius ; a jovian radius is adopted for model m1a2 ( left panel ) , while a saturnian radius is adopted for model m02a2 ( right panel ) .",
    "the contours in the upper panels of figure  [ fig:6 ] show a thin disk close to the protoplanet ( @xmath202 ) , while the gas envelope far from the protoplanet ( @xmath203 ) has a thick torus - like density distribution . in the region",
    "far from the protoplanet ( @xmath204 ) , the disk is flared , because the circumplanetary disk connects smoothly to the circumstellar disk , which is thicker than the circumplanetary disk .",
    "owing to rapid rotation near the protoplanet , the disk thins as it approaches the protoplanet .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] also shows the density distributions around the protoplanets in a birds - eye view , but at a larger scale than figure  [ fig:6 ] . each surface in figure  [ fig:7 ] represents an iso - density surface of @xmath205 ( red ) , @xmath206 ( orange ) and @xmath207 ( green and blue ) .",
    "the density distribution in the @xmath208 , @xmath197 and @xmath209 plane is projected onto each wall surface .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] shows that the central region sags in the centre of a concave structure , and a thin disk is formed around the protoplanet .",
    "in addition , a butterfly - like structure is also seen on each wall surface .",
    "these structures are considered to be formed by the rapid rotation of the central circumplanetary disk .",
    "the thin disk near the protoplanet ( red surface ) is enclosed by a torus - like thick disk ( orange and blue surfaces ) .",
    "figures  [ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] indicate that a thin disk appears only in a compact region of @xmath210 , and disk thickness becomes drastically large in the region of @xmath203 .",
    "these features are considered to result from the angular momentum of the protoplanetary system .    using the centrifugal radius , the radial extent of the circumplanetary ( thin ) disk can be related to the angular momentum of the protoplanetary system . under the assumption that the centrifugal force is balanced by the gravity of the protoplanet",

    "the centrifugal radius for the proto - jovian disk with @xmath214 and @xmath215au is @xmath216 which is 21 times the jovian radius ( @xmath217 , where @xmath218 ) or 0.028 times the jovian hill radius ( @xmath219 , where @xmath220 cm ) . in the same way",
    ", the centrifugal radius of the proto - saturnian disk is estimated as @xmath221 which is 66 times the saturnian radius ( @xmath222 , @xmath223 cm ) or 0.061 times the saturnian hill radius ( @xmath224 , where @xmath225 cm ) .",
    "these values are the same as the results of @xcite , in which the evolution of a protoplanetary system was investigated under the isothermal approximation with coarser spatial resolution than this study .",
    "observations showed that the regular satellites around jupiter and saturn are distributed in a compact region in close proximity to the planet ( @xmath226 ) , and are on prograde orbits near the equatorial plane .",
    "the galilean satellites , which are regular satellites of jupiter , are distributed in the range of @xmath227 , which is consistent with the centrifugal radius of equation  ( [ eq : rcent - j ] ) .",
    "the saturnian representative regular satellites ( mimas , enceladus , tethys , dione , rhea , titan , and iapetus ) are distributed in the range of @xmath228 , which corresponds well to equation  ( [ eq : rcent - s ] ) . in addition , the lower panels of figure  [ fig:6 ] show that the surface density has a peak in the region of @xmath229 .",
    "this is as a result of gas accumulation in this annulus because of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "thus , regular satellites may form in this compact region .",
    "after the formation of the circumplanetary gas disk , satellites may form in the disk .",
    "although there are many scenarios for satellite formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , regular satellites around gas giant planets are believed to form in the gaseous disk as planets form in the circumstellar disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "regular satellites are expected to form in the circumplanetary disk simultaneously with planets : the dust component condenses into a dust layer that fragments into satellitesimals in a thin disk near the protoplanet , and these satellitesimals merge to form satellites .",
    "@xcite suggested the minimum mass subnebular ( mmsn ) model , in which the mass of the present regular jovian satellite system is reconstructed assuming the dust - gas - ratio of the solar nebula .",
    "however , in this model , there are some difficulties for regular satellite formation . for example , planetesimals @xmath230 km in size fall into a central protoplanet within @xmath231yr due to the gas drag @xcite .",
    "in addition , the disk itself is expected to be dissipated by viscous spreading within @xmath232yr @xcite . to overcome these difficulties , @xcite suggested the gas - starved disk model , in which the circumplanetary disk has several orders of magnitude lower surface density than in the mmsn disk model . in this scenario , solids delivered",
    "to the disk build up over many disk viscous cycles , resulting in a greatly reduced gas - to - solids ratio during the final stages of satellite accretion .    at the callisto orbit ( @xmath233 ) , the mmsn disk model has @xmath234 @xcite , while the gas - starved disk model has @xmath235 @xcite .",
    "note that the gas - starved model assumes a very late stage of gas accretion onto jupiter , in which the gas flows to the protoplanet very slowly . in this study , as shown in figure  [ fig:6 ] , the surface density at the cellist orbit is @xmath236 which is an intermediate value between those of the mmsn and gas - starved disk models .",
    "the jovian representative regular satellites ( galilean satellites ) are distributed in the region of @xmath237 .",
    "this region is sufficiently resolved in this calculation , since the cell width and sink radius are @xmath238 and @xmath239 , respectively . however , the inner boundary condition ( i.e. , the sink ) may be inappropriate for investigating a circumplanetary disk close to the protoplanet .",
    "the sink cell is adopted to calculate the evolution of the protoplanetary system for a long duration . without the sink , such calculation is impossible , because gas falls into the central region with a velocity much higher than the sound speed , and the time step becomes quite small . to properly estimate the circumplanetary disk in very close proximity to the protoplanet",
    "( @xmath240 ) , the protoplanet model ( density and temperature ) must be set at the centre .",
    "however , such treatment is beyond our scope : we can not know the equation of state of the interior region of the protoplanet .",
    "note that it is impossible to perform a calculation for the protoplanet itself , because it requires much greater spatial resolution .    however , it is expected that the properties of the circumplanetary disk do not change qualitatively irrespective of the treatment of the inner boundary .",
    "@xcite showed that the specific angular momentum and configuration of the disk are determined by the size of the hill radius ( or gravitational potential of the protoplanet ) .",
    "this study showed that the specific angular momentum of a protoplanetary system is independent of the thermal evolution around the protoplanet after the protoplanet s mass exceeds @xmath241 , indicating that the properties of the circumplanetary disk are determined only by the outer boundary ( i.e. the size of the hill radius ) . on the other hand , the region in very close proximity to the protoplanet",
    "is slightly affected by thermal evolution , as shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] . since",
