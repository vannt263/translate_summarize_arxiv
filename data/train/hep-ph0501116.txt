    "in recent years , the study of the exotic pentaquark baryons has been one of the most exciting fields .",
    "evidence of exotic @xmath1 was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and a signal of another exotic state @xmath6 was subsequently observed  @xcite , though the experimental confirmation of the latter is somehow controversial . in hadron spectroscopy",
    ", the gell - mann  okubo[gmo ] formula has been successfully applied to describe the mass splitting of particles within an @xmath0 multiplet .",
    "the smallest multiplet containing @xmath1 and @xmath6 is the antidecuplet ( @xmath7 ) , and equal mass splitting is obtained from the gmo rule .",
    "here we would like to study the two - meson cloud effect to the baryon antidecuplet , which would contribute to mass splitting in addition to the gmo formula .",
    "the study of the two - meson cloud effect is motivated by the attempts of constructing the @xmath1 as a @xmath8 bound state  @xcite , in which an attractive interaction is found for the @xmath8 states of @xmath9 .",
    "although the found attraction is not enough to bind the three body system , such a configuration is naturally expected in the @xmath1 structure , by observing that the @xmath8 mass is only 30 mev above the @xmath1 state .    in the present work , assuming that the @xmath2 has a large antidecuplet component , we construct flavor @xmath0 effective interaction lagrangians , which account for the decay modes of the @xmath2 into @xmath10 . using these interaction lagrangians , we calculate the self - energy of the antidecuplet .",
    "details of the study can be found in ref .",
    "the interaction lagrangians are constrained to be @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "the process we are considering is @xmath11 , where we denote the octet baryon , meson and antidecuplet baryon as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . in order to construct a singlet from the product of @xmath13 , @xmath13 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14 , there are four combinations , in which two @xmath13 mesons are combined into @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "however , two of them ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) are identically zero , due to additional symmetry under exchange of two mesons . hence , without using derivatives , we can construct the following effective lagrangians : @xmath19 + h.c .   \\",
    ",      \\label{eq:27lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the baryon antidecuplet , baryon octet and meson octet fields , respectively .",
    "we have included a factor @xmath23 to make @xmath24 and @xmath25 dimensionless ( @xmath26 mev is the pion decay constant ) . in the low momentum expansion , the above lagrangians",
    "are the two lowest ones . in practice , however , they are not sufficient to account for the experimental decay of @xmath2 into @xmath3(@xmath5-wave ) . in order to reproduce such decay mode",
    ", we introduce a lagrangian with one derivative : @xmath27 we will address other possible interaction lagrangians  @xcite later on .    the antidecuplet self - energies are given by @xmath28 where the index @xmath29 labels the interaction lagrangians , @xmath30 is the energy of the antidecuplet baryon , @xmath31 are coupling constants appearing in the lagrangian , and @xmath32 are @xmath0 coefficients which are compiled in the appendix of ref .",
    "the function @xmath33 is the two - loop integral with two mesons and one baryon ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] , left ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the amplitudes derived from the lagrangian @xmath29 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the masses of a baryon and mesons , @xmath38 is the energy of the intermediate baryon",
    ". the real part of this integral is cut off with a three momentum @xmath39 in the range 700 - 800 mev .",
    "the imaginary part of the diagram provides the decay width .",
    "it is known that @xmath40-wave ) occurs through the @xmath41 decay , therefore , we improve the contact interaction of the @xmath42 to account for the vector meson propagator ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] , right ) , including the factor @xmath43 $ ] in each @xmath44 vertex .",
    "here we show the results with @xmath45 and @xmath42 . @xmath46 and",
    "other possible lagrangians will be addressed later .",
    "the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath47 are fixed so as to to obtain the partial decay widths of the @xmath2 to @xmath48-wave , isoscalar ) and @xmath49-wave , isovector ) respectively .",
    "the central values in the pdg  @xcite are 25 and 15 mev , which correspond to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "we take an average value of @xmath52 mev as input .",
    "the qualitative trend of the result does not depend on the @xmath30 , but the magnitude of the self - energy is changed  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : totresult ] we show the real parts of the self - energies for the contributions from @xmath45 and total contributions of @xmath42 and @xmath45 , with cutoffs @xmath53 and @xmath54 mev .",
    "we see that all the self - energies are attractive , and that the interaction is more attractive the larger the strangeness .",
    "@xmath45 provides more binding than @xmath42 for the same cutoff .",
    "the splitting between the @xmath55 and @xmath56 states is about 45 - 60 mev depending on the cutoff .",
    "since the experimental splitting of the @xmath57 and @xmath58 is 320 mev , the two - meson cloud provides 20% of the total splitting .",
    "this should be compared to 60% naturally provided by the mass of the constituent strange quarks , which would leave about 20% more for the effects of quark correlations .     with @xmath59 mev.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   with @xmath59 mev.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the partial decay widths are shown in table  [ tbl : decay ] .",
    "we have taken the observed masses @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 mev as @xmath30 , because the phase space is essential for the decay width .",
    "we can see that the widths are not very large for all channels .",
    "indeed , @xmath63 and @xmath58 would have widths for three body channels of about 24 and 2 mev , which are compatible with the experimental total width of about 70 and 18 mev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "detailed information of the partial decay widths of three body channels will give us more understanding of the interaction lagrangian .",
    ".partial decay widths for the allowed channels and total width for any @xmath64 channel , at the masses of the antidecuplet members .",
    "all values are listed in units of mev . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tbl : decay ]    in ref  @xcite , apart from the above lagrangians and a @xmath65 term , we also considered the leading order lagrangians in a chiral expansion as dictated by qcd .",
    "there are two terms : one chirally symmetric and a mass term .",
    "the latter has to be tiny since it violates su(3 ) .",
    "the former gives similar results to @xmath66 .",
    "the role of chiral symmetry is thus small and the use of @xmath66 is justified .",
    "we study the self - energy of the baryon antidecuplet due to the two - meson cloud . the assumptions made throughout the paper and",
    "the uncertainties in the experimental input make the nature of our analysis qualitative .",
    "however , in all different cases studied , the two - meson cloud mechanism leads to the following conclusions : an attractive self - energy is obtained for all members of the antidecuplet . the two - meson cloud contributes to the mass splitting between antidecuplet members about 20% of the empirical one .",
    "these observations are consistent with the previous attempts to describe the @xmath1 as a @xmath8 state  @xcite , and the magnitude of 20% is also in agreement quantitatively with the strength of attraction  @xcite .",
    "the role played by the two - meson cloud is therefore of relevance for a precise understanding of the nature of the @xmath1 and the antidecuplet .",
