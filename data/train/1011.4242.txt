    "traditional models for the spread of sir ( susceptible @xmath0 infectious @xmath0 recovered ) epidemics  @xcite are based on the homogeneous mixing assumption , that is , all pairs of individuals in the population contact each other at the same rate , independently of each other . generalizations of this model have been proposed by introducing household structure into the population  @xcite , where contacts between household members are more frequent than other contacts ; by introducing a ( social ) network structure  @xcite , where contacts are only possible between pairs of individuals that share a connection in the network ; or both  @xcite . in most models for epidemics on networks",
    ", the network is modelled by a random graph constructed via the configuration model  @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  3 ) . in this",
    "construction one can control the degree distribution of the vertices , but the resulting network is locally tree - like , in the sense that the network contains hardly any cliques ( small completely connected groups ) or short loops . in real social networks cliques are not sparse : ` the friends of my friends are likely to be my friends as well ' .",
    "this feature of networks has been captured ( among other models , such as those in  @xcite ) by random intersection graphs , introduced in @xcite and further studied in e.g.  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a related model ) .",
    "random intersection graphs might be seen as models for overlapping groups / cliques , in which a contact between two individuals is possible only if there is a group to which they both belong .",
    "these graphs are also known as random key graphs in computer science @xcite and are related to rasch models @xcite in the social sciences . in our paper , and in most random intersection graph models in the literature , the resulting graph still has a tree structure , though now at the level of cliques .",
    "this structure allows for analysis , but arguably only captures some features of real ( social ) networks .",
    "it is possible to make the graphs more realistic by incorporating spatial location @xcite , but this makes the model intractable for our purposes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study sir epidemics on random intersection graphs .",
    "specifically , we use branching process approximations to derive ( i ) a threshold parameter @xmath1 , which determines whether an epidemic with few initial infectives can become established and infect a non - negligible proportion of the population , an event we call a large outbreak ; ( ii ) the probability that a large outbreak occurs ; and ( iii ) the fraction of the population that is infected by a large outbreak .",
    "these approximations are made fully rigorous as the population size tends to infinity by proving associated limit theorems .",
    "the only previous rigorous study of epidemics on random intersection graphs is  @xcite .",
    "we extend the analysis of  @xcite in three directions .",
    "first , we allow more general distributions for both group size and the number of groups a typical individual belongs to . in  @xcite , both of these quantities follow poisson distributions ; here we allow them to follow mixed - poisson distributions .",
    "moreover , as discussed in section  [ disc ] , we expect similar results to hold when they both follow quite general distributions , though our proofs are valid only for the mixed - poisson case .",
    "secondly , we allow for an arbitrary infectious period distribution , unlike in  @xcite where a reed - frost type model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.2 ) ( which effectively has a constant infectious period ) is used .",
    "thirdly , we give a formal proof of a law of large numbers for the final outcome of a large outbreak , a result that was conjectured but not proved in  @xcite . introducing variable infectious periods",
    "significantly complicates the analysis .",
    "we note that for random infectious periods , our model is not covered by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5 ) , since we need directed inhomogeneous random graphs and the proofs in  @xcite rely heavily on the structure of undirected graphs .",
    "therefore , we need to develop alternative techniques to determine the fraction of the population that is infected by a large outbreak .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ eprig ] gives a brief introduction to random intersection graphs and sir epidemics defined upon them .",
    "the main results of the paper , together with associated heuristic explanations , are given in section  [ mainresults ] .",
    "in particular , in section  [ earlystages ] we show how the early stages of an epidemic in our model can be approximated by a multitype ( forward ) branching process ( whose type space is in general uncountable ) , yielding a threshold parameter @xmath1 and the approximate probability of a large outbreak . in section  [ finaloutcome ] , a single - type ( backward ) branching process , which enables the proportion of the population that is infected by a large outbreak to be determined , is described .",
    "the key limit theorems of the paper are stated in section  [ sirrig ] .",
    "they show that , if there are few initial infectives , then in a large population : ( i ) a large outbreak can occur only if the forward branching process is supercritical ; ( ii ) the probability that a large outbreak occurs is close to the probability that the forward branching process survives ; and ( iii ) if there is a large outbreak , then the proportion of the population that is infected by the epidemic is close to the survival probability of the backward branching process .",
    "the forward multitype branching process is studied in section  [ forwardbp ] , where it is shown that the process survives with non - zero probability if and only if @xmath4 and that the survival probability may be obtained using a functional equation , which , as is proved in appendix  [ appendix1 ] , has at most one non - zero solution .",
    "the limit theorems corresponding to the forward and backward branching processes are proved in sections  [ pextinctionthm ] and  [ pfinalsizethm ] , respectively .",
    "extension to more general distributions of clique size and the number of groups a typical individual belongs to is discussed briefly in section  [ disc ] .",
    "explicit expressions , in terms of gontcharoff polynomials , for @xmath1 and for the probability generating function(als ) of the offspring distributions of the backward and forward branching processes ( which enable the survival probabilities of these processes to be computed ) are derived in appendix  [ fsrv ] .",

    "we may construct a directed graph from an undirected one by replacing every undirected edge by two directed edges with the same end - vertices but having opposite directions .",
    "if we construct a simple graph from a multi - graph , we do this by merging parallel edges and removing self - loops .",

    "we show how the susceptibility set of an individual may be approximated by a ( backward ) branching process , which is single - type even if @xmath118 is not constant .",
    "furthermore , we explain why , if @xmath69 is large , the proportion of the population that is ultimately infected by an epidemic that becomes established is approximately the probability that the backward branching process avoids extinction .",
    "the above approximations are made fully rigorous by considering sir epidemics on a sequence of random intersection graphs , indexed by the population size @xmath69 , and proving associated limit theorems .",
    "these theorems are stated in section  [ sirrig ] and proved in section  [ proofs ] .",
    "calculation of extinction probabilities for the forward and backward branching processes requires exact results concerning the final outcome and susceptibility sets for standard sir epidemics in closed homogeneously mixing populations , which are given in appendix  [ fsrv ] .",
    "consider the epidemic model @xmath119 defined in section  [ sirepidemics ] and , for simplicity , suppose first that the infectious period is constant , i.e.  there exists @xmath128 such that @xmath129 . in the limit as the population size @xmath65 , the initial infective , @xmath130 say , belongs to @xmath131 cliques , having sizes @xmath132 , where , given @xmath16 , the random variables @xmath133 are mutually independent and @xmath134 @xmath135 .",
    "the size biasing comes in because the probability of being part of a clique is proportional to its weight .",
