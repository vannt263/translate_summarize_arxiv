    "a large fraction of seyfert 1 galaxies show significant reddening of their continua and emission lines due to an intrinsic column of dust ( ward et al .",
    "x - ray observations of a number of these galaxies show that the column density of neutral hydrogen is much smaller than that derived from the reddening ( komossa et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "brandt , fabian , & pounds ( 1996 ) suggested that the dust exists within a warm absorber , characterized by o  vii and o  viii bound - free edges , although they mentioned the possibility that the dust exists in lower ionization gas in which the hydrogen is still stripped . in kraemer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we found that lower ionization gas in the form of a dusty `` lukewarm absorber '' provides a more natural explanation than the dusty warm absorber , because it can be placed at a sufficient radial distance from the nucleus ( @xmath0 100 pc ) to redden most of the emission from the narrow - line region ( nlr ) .",
    "we predicted that the lukewarm absorber could be identified by strong , and in some cases saturated , uv absorption lines ( c  iv , n  v , si  iv , and mg  ii ) in reddened seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "we subsequently identifed lukewarm absorbers in _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) spectra of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  3227 ( crenshaw et al . 2001a ) and the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy akn 564 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2001b ) . in both cases ,",
    "photoionization models of the uv absorption lines confirmed that the column of gas ( n@xmath1 @xmath2 1  2 x 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ) is sufficient to provide the observed reddening , assuming a dust - to - gas ratio that is within a factor of two of the galactic value given by n(h ) @xmath2 5.2 x 10@xmath3 e(b@xmath5v ) @xmath4 ( shull & van steenberg 1985 ) .",
    "interestingly , the galactic disks of both seyferts are inclined ( @xmath6 63   for ngc  3227 , @xmath6 59  for akn 564 ; de zotti & gaskell 1985 ) , so that our line of sight intercepts more gas and dust in their disks than for face - on galaxies .",
    "in addition , the intrinsic absorbers for both objects have velocities within 200 km s@xmath7 of the systemic velocities of their host galaxies , consistent with an origin in the galactic disks ( unger et al . 1987 ) , whereas most uv absorbers show substantial outflow velocities with respect to their nuclei ( up to @xmath52100 km  s@xmath7 , see crenshaw et al .",
    "finally , the depths of the uv lines confirm that the absorbers cover the nlrs in these objects , which indicates that they are at distances @xmath0 100 pc from the seyfert nuclei ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "these findings led us to suggest that the dusty lukewarm absorbers lie in the galactic disks of these seyferts , and may due to a highly ionized component in the extended narrow - line region ( enlr ) . in this letter",
    ", we pursue this suggestion by investigating the connection between reddening , uv absorption , and host galaxy inclination in a large sample of seyfert galaxies .",
    "we have assembled data from the literature and the _ iue _ and _ hst _ archives for 48 seyfert 1 galaxies ; these data are listed in table 1 .",
    "the list includes the 30 seyfert 1 galaxies in the ward et al .",
    "( 1987 ) study of continuum reddening , which contains the complete sample of hard x - ray selected sources of piccinotti et al .",
    "( 1982 ) plus a few other seyferts .",
    "four objects from the ward et al .",
    "sample were excluded from our study ( ngc  2992 , ngc 7172 , and ngc 7582 are generally considered to be seyfert 2 galaxies , and 3c  273 is a quasar ) .",
    "we have also included seyfert 1s in our sample that appear in recent studies of uv absorption ( e.g. , ulrich 1988 ; crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) or x - ray absorption ( e.g. , reynolds 1997 ; george et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "ward et al .",
    "( 1987 ) found that at least 30% of the seyfert 1 galaxies in their sample showed signs of heavy reddening .",
    "their broad - band 1 - 20 @xmath8 m photometry combined with previous optical and iras fluxes indicated that the continuum energy distributions of these objects could be placed into one of three categories : a ) bare , minimally reddened , b ) reddened , or c ) contaminated by the host galaxy .",
    "seyferts with strong blue fluxes ( i.e. , at 3600  ) were placed in class a , those with steep visible spectra ( decreasing to the blue ) and flat far - infrared spectra were placed in class b , and those with steeply rising flux from 12 to 60 @xmath8 m were placed in class c. we list these designations in table 1 .",
    "we also list the axial ratios ( b / a ) of the host galaxies from , in order of preference , de zotti & gaskell ( 1985 ) , kirhakos & steiner ( 1990 ) , nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , or direct measurement from the palomar sky survey ( poss ) images , as noted .",
    "we prefer the de zotti & gaskell ( 1985 ) compilation , since it uses measurements from large - scale plates when available ; the other measurements rely strictly on poss images . in table 1",
    ", we note the presence or absence of uv absorption based on _ hst _ spectra obtained at moderate to high spectral resolution ( @xmath9/@xmath10 @xmath0 1000 ) .",
    "most of these are from crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , although results on the following individual objects are also included : ton  s180 ( turner et al .",
    "2001 ) , ngc 3227 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2001a ) , and ngc 4051 ( collinge et al .",
    "we also include a seyfert 1 galaxy that shows significant evidence for intrinsic c  iv and mg  ii absorption in _ iue _ spectra : mcg 8 - 11 - 11 ( ulrich 1988 ) .",
    "we list the galactic reddening e(b@xmath5v ) values from ned that were derived from the maps of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    in order to estimate the extinction",
    ", we determined a uv color from the continuum fluxes in _ hst _ or _ iue _ spectra .",
    "for those sources with _",
    "spectra , we used our measurements of continuum fluxes at 1350    ( far - uv ) and 2200   ( near - uv ) .",
    "these wavelengths were chosen to avoid contamination by line emission ; in particular , the 2200   region is just shortward of the `` little blue bump '' , which consists of fe  ii emission in the uv ( wills , netzer , & wills 1985 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the sensitivity of _ iue _ at 2200   is quite poor ; thus , for objects with only archival _ iue _ spectra , we used the region around 2400    for the near - uv point ( we discuss the effects of this choice in  3 ) .",
    "we obtained the _ iue _",
    "fluxes from the tabulated values in the agn compilation of courvoisier & paltani ( 1992 ) ; in cases of multiple observations , we used the first pair of well - exposed swp and lwp images obtained on the same day .",
    "a few objects were observed after the publication of this catalog , and their fluxes were taken directly from spectra in the _ iue _ archives .",
    "note that we do not regard this as a complete sample , since the requirement for uv spectra biases the sample towards seyferts with significant uv flux .",
    "however , the sample is large enough to show clear trends among the reddening properties , as we will demonstrate .",
    "to investigate the trends in our sample , we use the inclination of the host galaxy : @xmath11 and define a uv color ( in magnitudes ) : @xmath12.\\ ] ]    in figure 1 , we plot these two quantities for seyferts designated type a or b by ward et al .",
    "( we omit the point for 3c  120 , since its type b classification is due to high galactic reddening ; see table 1 ) .",
    "the uv colors have been corrected for galactic reddening using the curve of savage & mathis ( 1979 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that the uv color fuv@xmath5nuv provides a measurement of reddening that is consistent with the ward et al .",
    "results ; those objects with fuv@xmath5nuv @xmath13 @xmath50.2 are type a ( unreddened ) and those with fuv@xmath5nuv @xmath14 @xmath50.2 are type b ( reddened ) .",
    "thus , we can use the uv color as a consistent reddening indicator for the seyferts in our entire sample .",
    "we note that this correlation implies that the reddening curves of seyfert galaxies typically lack a significant 2200   bump , since the bump yields comparable extinctions at 1350   and 2200   in the standard galactic curve ( savage & mathis 1979 ) .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the lack of a 2200   bump in the reddening curves of the seyfert galaxies ngc 3227 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2001a ) , akn 564 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2001b ) , and quasars in general ( pitman , clayton , & gordon 2000 ) .",
    "figure 1 also demonstrates that the inclined sources tend to be the most reddened , which indicates that the reddening is primarily associated with dust in the plane of the host galaxy .",
    "similar correlations have been found in previous studies .",
    "cheng , danese , & de zotti ( 1983 ) found that the optical colors b@xmath5v and u@xmath5b of seyfert 1 nuclei increase ( i.e , become redder ) with decreasing axial ratio ( i.e. , increasing inclination ) . de zotti & gaskell ( 1985 ) found that the balmer decrement h@xmath15/h@xmath16 of the broad lines increases with decreasing axial ratio , and the narrow - line decrement shows a similar , though less significant , behavior .",
    "we point out the advantage of using the uv color for this type of correlation is that it is very sensitive to reddening , since reddening curves tend to be steep in the uv .    in figure 2",
    ", we have replotted the uv color against inclination angle for the entire sample , flagging those sources for which the presence or absence of intrinsic uv absorption is known . the correlation between uv color and inclination",
    "is well established in this sample .",
    "the dispersion in uv colors at low inclinations is due in large part to the intrinsic dispersion in spectral energy distributions , since the uv color of even an individual seyfert can vary significantly .",
    "for example , based on the _ iue _ fluxes of fairall 9 in courvoisier & paltani ( 1992 ) , fuv @xmath5 nuv varied from @xmath50.3 to @xmath51.0 as it went through a factor of @xmath1730 variation in flux at 1350   ( with more negative colors corresponding to larger fluxes ) .",
    "other sources of dispersion at all inclinations could be : 1 ) different amounts of dust in the lines of sight through the host galaxies ( due to intrinsic variations in dust content or clumpiness ) , 2 ) different reddening curves ( see crenshaw et al .",
    "2001b ) , or 3 ) additional components of dusty gas that are not coplaner with the host galaxy ( see  4 ) .",
    "the use of the 2400   region ( instead of 2200  ) for the _ iue _ spectra introduces only a small amount of scatter . from the stis spectrum of ngc  4151 , which has a relatively large  little blue bump \" ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2001a ) , we find that the fe  ii emission in this region increases fuv@xmath5nuv by only @xmath180.10 , whereas the use of the continuum fit at 2400    ( i.e. , if ngc  4151 had no emission bump ) decreases fuv@xmath5nuv by only @xmath50.09 .",
    "the seyfert 1 galaxies in figure 1 with intrinsic absorption are distributed thoughout the full range of inclination angle .",
    "this is not surprising , since many of these absorbers are known to be associated with the active nuclei ( and not the host galaxies ) , due to their high outflow velocities , variability , or less than one covering factors ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , it is interesting that absorption - free seyfert 1 galaxies are completely lacking at high inclination angles .",
    "we suggest that the reason for this is that sources in this area of the plot tend to be reddened , and a column of dusty gas which causes even marginally detectable reddening will produce detectable uv absorption lines , unless very highly ionized .",
    "for example , we have generated a set of models using the photoionization code cloudy90 ( ferland et al.1998 ) and the form of the ionizing continuum described in kraemer et al .",
    "we varied the ionization parameter ( number of ionizing photons per hydrogen atom at the illuminated face of the slab ) for a fixed total hydrogen column of 5 x 10@xmath19 @xmath4 , which corresponds to a reddening of e(b@xmath5v ) @xmath2 0.10 ( shull & van steenberg 1985 ) .",
    "we asssumed solar abundances ( see grevesse & anders 1989 ) , and a 65% depletion of the carbon onto grains .",
    "we find that for ionization parameters u @xmath13 3.0 , the column density of c  iv will be @xmath14 10@xmath20 @xmath4 , which is the approximate detection limit for current high - resolution stis spectra ( kraemer et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the labeled seyfert 1 galaxies in figure 2 are particularly interesting . all show evidence for reddening , and in addition , saturated c  iv and n  v absorption lines near the systemic velocities of their host galaxies .",
    "as we have shown , these are the signatures of dusty lukewarm absorbers in ngc  3227 and akn  564 , and we expect that future high - resolution spectra and modeling of the absorbers in wpvs 007 and mcg 8 - 11 - 11 will show that the columns of uv absorbing gas are sufficient to provide the observed reddenings . furthermore , we predict that the other heavily reddened , inclined seyfert galaxies ( ngc  931 , ic  4329a , ngc  5506 , and mcg -6 - 30 - 15 in particular ) will show dusty lukewarm absorbers .",
    "we conclude that there are at least two types of uv absorbers in seyfert 1 galaxies : dusty lukewarm absorbers in the plane of the host galaxy and absorbers intrinsic to the nucleus .",
    "the first type is a natural consequence of viewing the nucleus through a host galaxy at a large inclination angle .",
    "it can be identified through saturated uv absorption lines ( typically c  iv and n  v ) near the systemic velocity in a seyfert galaxy that shows evidence for reddening of its nonstellar continuum and emission lines , including those from the nlr . given the morphological and kinematic evidence that the extended narrow - line region ( enlr ) in a seyfert galaxy is ionized gas in the galactic disk ( unger et al .",
    "1987 ) , we suggest that the dusty lukewarm absorber is a highly ionized component of the enlr seen in absorption",
    ".    the other type of absorber ( i.e. , intrinsic to the nucleus ) can be identified through absorption - line variability , high outflow velocities , and/or covering factors that are less than one .",
    "thus , it is possible in many cases to use this information to separate the two types of absorbers , permitting more focused studies of either phenomenon .",
    "we note that it may not always be possible to identify the origin of a particular absorber ; for example , a saturated absorber with low _ radial _ velocity , a covering factor of one , and no evidence for variability does not automatically fall into the dusty lukewarm absorber class ( i.e. , in the host galaxy ) .",
    "however , we suggest that evidence for reddening by a column sufficient to produce the absorption lines , plus evidence for covering of the nlr , does place it in this class .",
    "one interesting question is : why do nt all seyfert 1 galaxies show uv absorption ?",
    "since nearly all seyfert galaxies are spirals , we might expect a significant column of gas for even face - on objects .",
    "xilouris et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find that a line - of - sight to the nucleus of a normal spiral galaxy will show a column of a n@xmath1 @xmath21 5 x 10@xmath19 @xmath4 at zero inclination , which should normally produce observable uv absorption lines (  3 ) .",
    "however , @xmath1740% of seyfert 1 galaxies show no uv absorption lines at all , including ly@xmath15 ( crenshaw et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the answer may be that gas originally associated with the host galaxy is evacuated in the vicinity of the nucleus , ( i.e. , distances @xmath22 100 pc ) as suggested by de zotti & gaskell ( 1985 ) .",
    "this evacuation would occur at least within some polar angle relative to the axis of the accretion disk and/or putative torus ( and within the ionization bicone through which we presumably view seyfert 1 galaxies ) .",
    "support for partial evacuation of the bicone comes through kinematic models of the outflowing gas in the nlr ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2000 ) . as we mentioned previously , another possibility for the lack of uv absorption is that the gas is highly ionized ( u @xmath14 3 ) close to the nucleus .    in many ,",
    "if not all , seyfert galaxies , there is clearly another source of extinction at distances less than 100 pc from the nucleus ( e.g. , a dusty torus or dusty wind ) .",
    "only a small fraction of seyfert 2 galaxies can be attributed to viewing seyfert 1 host galaxies at large inclination angles , due to the small range of inclination angles that would completely extinguish the nucleus .",
    "furthermore , the source of extinction is not , in general , coplaner with the host galaxy , since seyfert 2 galaxies are not seen preferentially edge - on ( kirhakos & steiner 1990 ) . an important pursuit would be to determine the connection , if any , between reddening and uv absorption in the inner regions , since this would undoubtedly lead to a better understanding of the origin of the absorbers .",
    "an interesting example is the high - column ( n@xmath1 @xmath2 2.7 x 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ) absorber in ngc  4151 , which is dust - free because it is located at a distance of only @xmath170.03 pc ( kraemer et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is well within the dust sublimation radius for this seyfert .",
    "studies of the reddening properties of other high - column uv absorbers would be helpful in determining if this is a common occurrence .",
    "knowledge of the inclination angle of the accretion disk and/or torus with respect to our line of sight is also very important , and could be obtained , for example , from kinematic models of the nlr outflow ( crenshaw et al .",
