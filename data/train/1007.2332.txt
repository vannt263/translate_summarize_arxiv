    "recent interest in novel ion trap geometries stems from both the need for smaller , more compact radiofrequency ( rf ) paul ion traps @xcite and traps that have novel common modes of motion @xcite .",
    "we present a new compact `` halo '' ion trap geometry based on toroidal ion traps @xcite that might satisfy both of these needs .",
    "this new geometry has the advantage of being much smaller ( on the order of a few hundred microns in diameter ) than previous toroidal traps .",
    "additionally , this geometry is very open both optically and electronically : ions trapped around the circular rf node interact via the coulomb force across the circle with very little shielding , similar to ions in a penning - type trap , giving rise to strong ion - ion interactions across the trap @xcite . to date ,",
    "coulomb crystals have been studied in a number of different rf trap geometries including a linear trap @xcite , a spherical trap @xcite , ions confined to a two - dimensional plane @xcite , ions in a large toroid trap with no ion interaction across the circle @xcite , and ions in a penning trap @xcite .",
    "our compact halo trap geometry is complementary to many of these previously studied systems .",
    "this geometry may also be suited to simulating small chemical rings @xcite , circular clusters of electrons on the surface of liquid helium @xcite , and novel ising models @xcite .",
    "we begin by defining by the key parameters and characteristics of the compact halo ion trap geometry .",
    "our setup is based on readily available electrode parts , making this configuration straightforward and inexpensive to implement .",
    "we model both the rf and static potentials in the trap using finite element analysis ; we present the results from a monte carlo optimization of the adjustable physical trap parameters yielding a trapping rf potential that is hyperbolic near the center of the trap . in order to provide complete control of the ions",
    ", we also optimize offset static potentials that provide control over the trap aspect ratio . in the final section",
    "we derive the conditions for a crystal phase transition for two ions in this new geometry .",
    "we show that , unlike a linear trap , there is a non - trivial phase transition for only two ions .",
    "a traditional rf quadrupole mass spectrometer or ion trap is created from four long cylindrical rods placed at the corners of a square as in fig .  [",
    "fig : haloevolution](a ) .",
    "alternating rf potentials , @xmath0 , are applied to the electrodes forming a 2d quadrupole potential in the center of the square with a node that runs the length of the rods .",
    "a toroidal rf trap is formed by wrapping the ends of linear trap around on themselves , forming four concentric loops stacked two on top of the others as in fig .",
    "[ fig : haloevolution](b ) @xcite .",
    "we propose one further modification that shrinks the toroidal trap and simplifies trap fabrication . since the inner rings are equipotential surfaces both on the top and the bottom , we shrink these rings down to solid , cylindrical electrodes , shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : haloevolution](c ) .",
    "the outer two electrodes are also modified : we use conductive tubes to create these potentials , again concentric with the central electrodes .",
    "we envision an ion trap with an rf node diameter of less than 1  mm .        in order to control the relative trap aspect ratio in the @xmath1 plane defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldschematic ] , key to studying the crystal phase transitions @xcite , we utilize both rf and static trapping fields .",
    "figure  [ fig : fieldschematic ] shows a cross - section of the halo geometry : rotating the @xmath1 plane about the axis located at the left of the figure yields the 3d trap configuration illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : halo3d ] . the electrode geometry described above forms a quadrupole potential like that illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldschematic](a ) for potentials @xmath0 applied to the center electrode and the outer tube . the effective rf potential , or pseudopotential ,",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldschematic](b ) , the center of which is located along the @xmath2 center line of the geometry .",
    "to lowest order , the pseudopotential is symmetric in the @xmath1 plane ; we discuss higher - order asymmetries below . a static potential like that illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldschematic](c ) , which is rotated by 45 degrees from the rf potentials , is needed to control the relative trap strengths in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions .",
    "we add a middle tube control electrode between the central cylinder and outer tube electrode that we can bias with static potentials to create this field .",
    "this middle electrode is rf grounded with a static potential @xmath5 applied to both the top and bottom electrodes .",
    "both the inner and outer electrodes are also biased with static potentials , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the combination of the rf pseudopotential and this static potential will enable us to vary the trap aspect ratio , illustrated in fig .",

    "note that the middle control electrodes are held at rf ground .",
    "( b ) the ideal pseudopotential is thus symmetric in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "( c ) in order to break the symmetry , static potentials @xmath8 are applied to the both the rf and control electrodes , forming a quadrupole rotated by 45 degrees from the rf potential .",
    "( d ) the combination of the static and pseudo potentials gives an asymmetric trap , indicating complete control over both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 trapping potentials.,width=302 ]        there are a large number of free parameters available in the design and optimization of this halo trap geometry ; we optimize a set of these parameters in order to minimize the higher - order , non - quadratic elements in the rf and static potentials .",
    "we begin by fixing the inner and outer diameters of the cylinder and tubes that make the ion trap electrodes .",
    "we choose stock parts ( from small parts , inc . ) for these electrodes .",
    "the inner cylinder is a stainless steel wire with an outer diameter of 510  @xmath9 m ( part gwx-0200 ) .",
    "the middle tube electrode is a 19 gauge stainless steel hypodermic round tube with an inner diameter ( i d ) of 830  @xmath9 m and an outer diameter ( od ) of 1100  @xmath9 m ( part htx-19 t ) . the outer tube electrode is a 16 gauge stainless steel hypodermic round tube with an i d of 1350  @xmath9 m and an od of 1650  @xmath9 m ( part htx-16 t ) .",
    "the electrodes are separated by concentric insulating tubes , matched to the various inner and outer diameters .",
    "we located uhv - compatible stock parts made of polyimide that serve as the insulators ( parts swpt-028 and twpt-045 ) .",
    "although we choose specific parts for our design and optimization , all of our calculations serve for any size trap that has the same ratio of radii for the cylinder:(inner tube id):(inner tube od):(outer tube id):(outer tube od ) ratio of 1:1.63:2.16:2.65:3.24 .",
    "having fixed the radii of the three electrodes , the number of adjustable free parameters available to optimize the potentials is now reduced to the spacing between the upper and lower sets of electrodes and the needle tip angle @xmath10 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameters ] ) .",
    "we denote the spacings as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 for the inner cylindrical `` needle '' , the middle `` control '' electrode , and outer `` tube '' electrode , respectively , as described in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameters ] .",
    "the tip angle will be fabricated by machining the inner wire prior to trap assembly .",
    "the other dimensions described in the figure are the inner cylinder radius @xmath14 , the radii of the two tubes @xmath15 and @xmath16 depicted as the distance from the center axis of rotation to the center of the electrode , and the tube wall thicknesses @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the control and outer tube electrodes .",
    "these five dimensions are fixed by the electrode geometry described above .",
    "we define three dimensionless parameters from these physical parameters and vary them to optimize the potentials .",
    "first , the trap aspect ratio @xmath19 is defined as the ratio of the average @xmath4 separation of the needle and tube to the tube radius : @xmath20 .",
    "this roughly corresponds to the overall aspect ratio of the trap , or the distance between the top and bottom electrode structures .",
    "the second parameter is the `` keystone '' @xmath21 defined as the ratio of the outer tube separation over the needle separation : @xmath22 .",
    "this parameter describes how much farther apart the outer tubes are compared to the inner cylinder .",
    "the final parameter is defined as @xmath23 and describes the control electrode separation as compared to the tube separation in units of the needle separation .",
    "these parameters define several possible configurations simply : if all three electrodes are separated by the same amount equal to the tube radius @xmath16 , the parameter set would be : @xmath24 .",
    "a parameter set of @xmath25 corresponds to separations of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the geometry illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : halo3d ] corresponds to a parameter set of approximately @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and a needle angle of @xmath32 .",
    "although motion of ions in an rf paul trap can be described in a variety of ways , the typical approach is to model the trapping potentials as an ideal quadrupole field @xcite .",
    "the oscillating trapping potential @xmath33 for a toroidal trap in cylindrical coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath4 can be written as a spatially varying potential @xmath35 which oscillates at the trap frequency @xmath36 : @xmath37 .",
    "the spatial component of the potential is typically described as a quadrupole field , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the potential applied symmetrically to hyperbolic electrodes a distance @xmath40 from the trap center . a toroidal trap like this halo trap shifts",
    "the trap center radially a distance @xmath41 from the @xmath4 axis as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameters ] .",
    "although the purely quadratic field described by shifting the quadrupole field @xmath42 is not possible , we are interested a trapping potential where the quadratic term is dominant @xcite .",
    "thus , we fit the actual halo trap potential to the model hyperbolic potential @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is a single fit parameter .",
    "however , since the rf fields are rotated by 45 degrees from the @xmath1 axes , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldschematic](a ) , we rotate the coordinate system of the hyperbolic potential in order to compare it directly with the halo trap field . the quadratic potential model describing the field in fig .  [ fig : fieldschematic](a ) is thus @xmath46 the static control potential shown in fig .  [ fig : fieldschematic](c ) can also be modeled as a hyperbolic potential .",
    "although we apply different control potentials to the needle and tubes , we fit the actual static potential with a single effective ( unit ) potential @xmath47 and the fit parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding static potential model is then @xmath49 we calculate the actual rf and static potentials , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , for this compact halo ( ch ) geometry for a given parameter set using finite element analysis .",
    "we use single - parameter fits ( with @xmath52  v and @xmath53  v ) to find the normalization distances @xmath45 and @xmath48 for the rf and static fields .",
    "we then define a @xmath54 metric for the two - dimensional scalar fields to determine the goodness of the fit .",
    "we integrate the square of the difference between the real and hyperbolic potentials over a circle area @xmath55 covering the center of the trapping region , @xmath56 we minimized both of these metrics simultaneously through an iterative monte carlo approach described below .",
    "we also investigate the depth of the rf trap , a particular concern for small and novel trap geometries @xcite .",
    "the depth is found by calculating the pseudopotential @xmath57 from the calculated rf trap potentials @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the ion charge and mass .",
    "there is a saddle point in the compact halo pseudopotential located along the @xmath34 axis approximately between the outer control electrode .",

    "3 .   iterate the entire process until both @xmath69 and @xmath73 are minimized .",
    "since the saddle points for the rf and static potentials do not necessarily have the same spatial location , unlike traditional four - rod traps , we simultaneously optimize both the rf and static potentials under the constraint that the saddle points overlap along the @xmath34-axis .",
