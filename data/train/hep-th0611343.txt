    "in this paper we extend and improve the analysis of bosonic open string field theory ( osft ) at the stable vacuum that we started in a previous work @xcite .",
    "osft possesses a classical , translational invariant solution whose energy density exactly cancels the brane tension and which is thought to represent the closed string vacuum with no open strings @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a solution has been persuasively demonstrated first @xcite within the level truncation ( lt ) expansion @xcite , and , more recently , analytically @xcite .",
    "the closed string interpretation requires that the spectrum of quadratic fluctuations around this classical solution be not only tachyon - free but also gauge - trivial .",
    "this expected property of the tachyonic vacuum goes under the name of sen s osft third conjecture .",
    "in @xcite we explained what sen s third conjecture implies for the gauge - fixed quadratic osft action expanded around the stable vacuum : _ each pole _ of the open string field propagator should cancel with appropriate poles of the ( second quantized ) ghost string fields . to state it more precisely , let us denote by @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is ( minus ) the second quantized ghost number invariant vacuum @xmath2 has ghost number -1 . in the natural hermitian product , @xmath3 .",
    "thus ghost and antighost string fields form canonically conjugate pairs @xmath4 with @xmath5 . ] ) the gauge - fixed kinetic operators for both matter and ghost string fields acting on states of momentum @xmath6 and ghost number @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath0 is the restriction to states of ghost number @xmath7 and momentum @xmath6 of the operator = \\ { , b_0 } [ kineticoperator ] where @xmath8 is the brs operator associated with the classical stable osft solution and @xmath9 is the zero mode of the 2d cft antighost field that implements the siegel gauge condition .",
    "if @xmath10 has a zero of order @xmath11 for @xmath12 , the number of physical  i.e. _ gauge - invariant _  degrees of freedom of mass @xmath13 is given by the fadeev - popov index : i_fp(m ) = d_0 - 2 d_1 + 2 d_2 + = _ n=-^ ( -1)^n d_n [ fpindex0 ] the spectrum of gauge - invariant quadratic fluctuations is empty if , and only if , the above index vanishes for all @xmath14 .",
    "both @xcite and the present paper study the spectrum of quadratic fluctuations of osft around the stable vacuum within the framework of the lt expansion",
    ". the key drawback of lt expansion is that it breaks ( second quantized ) brs invariance of the gauge - fixed osft action around the stable vacuum .",
    "consequently , poles of propagators of matter and ghost string fields which are degenerate in the exact theory correspond , in the level truncated theory , to multiplets of poles that are only approximately degenerate . the fadeev - popov index ( [ fpindex0 ] )",
    "should therefore be defined , in the level truncated theory , by including zeros of gauge - fixed kinetic operator @xmath0 which belong to the same approximately degenerate multiplet . in order for this definition to make sense",
    "the level has to be large enough that the splitting among zeros belonging to the same multiplet is significantly smaller than the separation between multiplets .",
    "it is expected  and explicit numerical computations confirm this  that matter and ghost propagators poles begin clustering together into well - defined approximately degenerate multiplets for levels which are increasingly large as @xmath15 . in practice ,",
    "therefore , the level truncated numerical analysis can probe reliably only a limited range of values of @xmath16 .",
    "the analysis of @xcite was limited to the lorentz _ scalar _ sector of the theory .",
    "numerical computations were performed using the approximation which , in terminology of @xcite , was of type @xmath17 for levels @xmath18 up to 6 and of type @xmath19 for levels @xmath20 . for @xmath21 propagators poles",
    "were found only in the twist - odd sector : it was observed that they form an approximately degenerate multiplet with vanishing fadeev - popov index around @xmath22 . in the twist",
    "- even scalar sector , propagators have no poles up to @xmath23 : at the level reached by the computation , poles with @xmath24 do not show yet any clear and stable multiplet structure .",
    "although these findings are well consistent with gauge - triviality of the spectrum of quadratic excitations , an unexpected result was also obtained in @xcite .",
    "the non - vanishing fadeev - popov degrees @xmath11 of the approximately degenerate multiplet of zeros of @xmath25 at @xmath26 were found to be d_0=2d_1=2d_2=1 [ fpdegrees ] it was moreover observed that while the ( approximate ) double zero of the determinant of the matter kinetic operator is associated to _ two _ distinct vanishing eigenvalues of @xmath27 , the double zero of @xmath28 is due to a _",
    "single _ eigenvector of the kinetic operator of ghost numbers @xmath29 whose eigenvalue ( p^2)(p^2+m^2_scalar,-)^2 [ doublepole ] has an ( approximate ) _",
    "double _ zero at @xmath26 .",
    "in other words there exists a ghost - antighost string field pair with ghost number @xmath29 whose propagator develops a double pole for @xmath26",
    ".    physical states are elements of the @xmath8-cohomology with zero ghost number .",
    "let us denote by @xmath30 the cohomology of @xmath8 on states of ghost number @xmath7 . because of ( [ kineticoperator ] ) , the zeros of the gauge - fixed kinetic operators also encode properties of @xmath8 acting on @xmath30 with @xmath7 different than zero . in @xcite it was argued that the double pole of the propagator of the ghost - antighost string field pair at @xmath31 , although consistent with the vanishing of @xmath32 , requires as well that -1()= -2()=1 [ dimcoho ] for the same value of @xmath14 .    in the present paper we confirm and refine this analysis in various ways .",
    "first , we compute the gauge - fixed kinetic operators @xmath0 for both the _ scalar _ and the _ vector _ lorentz sector .",
    "we also improve our lt computation , by performing the numerical evaluations in the @xmath33 approximation up to level @xmath34 .",
    "we find , on top of the multiplet of poles of the twist - odd scalar propagators already discovered in @xcite , multiplets of propagator poles , which are approximately degenerate and have vanishing fadeev - popov indices , both in the twist - even and in the twist - odd _ vector _ sector .",
    "the increased level reached by the computation allows for a simple linear extrapolation of the locations of the poles of the approximately degenerate fadeev - popov multiplets .",
    "the poles of propagators of different ghost numbers when extrapolated at level @xmath35 become indeed nearly coincident : see table  [ tabellazeri ] and figures  [ f : scalarodd]-[f : vectorodd ] of section  [ sec : numerical ] .",

    "integer _ even values of @xmath16 .",
    "the observed structure of the three multiplets is the same .",

    "these numerical results confirm sen s conjecture for both scalars and vectors in the region @xmath37 .",
    "in particular our approximation should be quite accurate for @xmath38 : hence , our computation provides ( the first ) robust direct evidence for the absence of the photon in the non - perturbative stable vacuum .    at the same time",
    ", the arguments developed in @xcite imply that non - empty cohomologies at non - standard ghost numbers must exist in the vector sectors as well as in the scalar sector . since this conclusion is somewhat unexpected and appears to contradict other works @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , we reconsider and strengthen in the present paper the analysis of @xcite , which relates the double pole of the ghost - antighost string field pair to non - vanishing cohomologies at non - standard ghost numbers .",
    "the main mathematical tool used in this analysis is the long infinite cohomology sequence ( ) n ( ) ( ) ( ) [ nonpertbottsequenceintro ] that computes the cohomologies @xmath30 in terms of _ relative _ tilde @xmath39 and check @xmath40 @xmath8-cohomologies .",
    "both tilde and check relative cohomologies are defined on fields which satisfy the siegel gauge condition .",

    "consequently , the tilde and the check cohomologies of the `` perturbative '' brs operator coincide .",
    "our numerical computations indicate that @xmath46 does not vanish for the non - perturbative @xmath8 .    in @xcite the cohomology sequence ( [ nonpertbottsequenceintro ] )",
    "was derived by making certain technical assumptions that were not otherwise proven .",
    "it was assumed that the space of gauge - fixed states decomposes as the direct sum of the kernel and the image of @xmath43 . in this paper",
    "we relax this hypothesis and establish the validity of ( [ nonpertbottsequenceintro ] ) beyond reasonable doubt .",
    "we emphasize that this is an _ exact _ result , independent of any numerical computation .",
    "we also show , without invoking any of the mathematical structures provided by the technical assumption made in @xcite , that the `` experimentally '' observed propagator double poles of the ghost string field pairs with ghost number @xmath29 are compatible with the exact long sequence only if eq .",
    "( [ dimcoho ] ) for non - standard cohomologies holds for the corresponding values of @xmath14 listed in ( [ poles ] ) .",
    "furthermore we refine this result by making use of the following observation . ) , were consistent with the long exact sequence .",
    "the analysis could not provide a unique possibility for the explicit representatives of the absolute cohomologies .",
    "this is achieved in the present paper . ]",
    "it is known @xcite that @xmath43 commutes with an @xmath51 symmetry whose @xmath52 generator is half of the ghost number . although the full @xmath51 symmetry does not commute with @xmath8 , the @xmath53 generator does . exploiting this symmetry",
    "we show that the null vectors of the kinetic operators for ghost number -1 and -2 provide explicit representatives of the non - vanishing cohomologies : & & ^-2(p)v_-2 = 0 - 2 ( ) + & & ^-1(p)v_-1=0 - 1 ( ) [ exoticcoho ]    we provide the detailed proof of ( [ exoticcoho ] ) in section [ sec : qaction ] .",
    "however it is useful to summarize here the basic reasons for this result .",
    "the important observation is that @xmath8 acts on the space @xmath54 spanned by the vectors which are in the kernel of both @xmath9 and @xmath43 at a given @xmath14 .",
    "these are the null vectors responsible for the poles of the string field propagators .",
    "the approximately degenerate poles that we found numerically correspond in the exact theory to a null space @xmath54 with the same dimension six for all the three sectors and values of @xmath14 listed in eq .",
    "( [ poles ] ) . for these values of @xmath14 ,",
    "@xmath8 acting on @xmath54 reduces to the operator @xmath55 that appears in the decomposition ( [ qtildedecomposition ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath56 on the six - dimensional space @xmath54 .",
    "the ( witten ) index of this supersymmetry is @xmath57 and equals the index of the relative tilde and check cohomologies = _ n ( -1)^n = = _ n ( -1)^n = 2 this implies that the relative cohomologies can not all vanish .",
    "@xmath54 decomposes into a singlet , a doublet and a triplet representation of the @xmath51 symmetry .",
    "clearly , there exists only a finite number of inequivalent representations of the supersymmetry operator @xmath55 acting on the finite - dimensional space @xmath58 . among these representations",
    "one should focus on those for which @xmath53 commutes with @xmath55 .",
    "there are four such inequivalent representations , as shown in section [ sec : qaction ] .",
    "since @xmath54 is finite dimensional , the infinite long exact sequence becomes a finite exact sequence .",
    "the fact that @xmath59 causes the exact sequence to split into four shorter sequences , putting further constrains on the possible representations of @xmath55 . in the end",
    ", it becomes a matter of simple linear algebra to show that only one representation of @xmath55 is compatible with the exact sequences : v_2 = 0 v_1 = 0 v_0^t=0 v_0^s = v_1 [ mhataction ] where @xmath60 is the @xmath51 singlet , @xmath61 the doublet , and @xmath62 the triplet .",
    "we went into these details to clarify that the result ( [ exoticcoho ] ) relies exclusively on the assumption that the multiplets of approximately degenerate propagators poles that we found numerically for the values of @xmath14 listed in ( [ poles ] ) do really correspond in the _ exact _ theory to multiplets of exactly degenerate poles .",
    "this assumption can not of course rigorously be proven by numerical methods alone . _",
    "a priori _ one can imagine that , as the level increases , either some of the poles we found disappear or some new pole shows up .",
    "this , although possible in principle , seems however unlikely for the following reasons .    to start with",
    ", the zeros @xmath63 of the determinants @xmath64 as the level is increased from @xmath65 to @xmath34 are nicely interpolated by linear relations p^2_n(l ) = p^2_n + q_nl with intercepts @xmath66 ( corresponding to @xmath35 ) which are independent of the ghost numbers @xmath67 with remarkably good approximation : see table  [ tabellazeri ] and figures  [ f : scalarodd]- [ f : vectorodd ] of section [ sec : numerical ] . the zeros with @xmath68 correspond to eigenvalues which vanish linearly in @xmath14 : on topological grounds , they are stable and therefore unlikely to disappear altogether . as we have mentioned above , the zeros with @xmath69 correspond instead to eigenvalues which vanish quadratically in @xmath14 and thus they are not protected by topological reasons . therefore one could think that  contrary to what our numerical computations seem to indicate  the pair of zeros with @xmath69 do not correspond , in the exact theory , to a single eigenvalue with a double zero : rather , one might fear that , as the level is increased , this pair of zeros would eventually be lifted .",
    "however , if this were the case , the fadeev - popov index would become positive and physical degrees of freedom would appear .",
    "in other words , if we _ assume _",
    "sen s conjecture , it becomes very difficult to provide an interpretation of our numerical findings different than what we have proposed .",
    "two more independent tests support the conclusion about the exotic cohomologies of @xmath8 that we inferred from the numerical computation .",
    "the first argument was already developed in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath70 has non - vanishing cohomologies for discrete values of @xmath14 only and @xmath59 , then the following equation must hold in the _ exact _ theory 0= -1 ( ) - -2()+ our result ( [ exoticcoho ] ) does satisfy this constraint and this seems to be a non - trivial check of its correctness .",
    "one more reasoning that strengthen our belief in the correctness of our conclusion ( [ exoticcoho ] ) is suggested by the numerical extrapolations ( [ poles ] ) obtained in the present paper .",
    "poles of propagators that correspond to gauge - trivial excitations are , in general , gauge - dependent . according to our extrapolations , the poles of the string fields seem to correspond , in the exact theory , to _ integer _ even values of @xmath16 .",
    "it becomes difficult to understand why this is so unless such poles have a _ gauge - invariant _ meaning , like the one provided by ( [ dimcoho ] ) .",
    "after we completed our numerical computations , the paper @xcite appeared where , following previous work @xcite , an analytical proof of the absence of physical states of osft around the stable vacuum is presented .",
    "the idea of this proof is to show that the identity state @xmath71 is @xmath8-exact : = a [ istate ] the authors of @xcite provide an explicit expression for the trivializing state @xmath72 a = 1_0 _ 0 [ astate ] where the operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 are obtained from the usual perturbative operators @xmath75 and @xmath9 by means of a certain coordinate transformation .",
    "the exactness of the identity implies not only the emptiness of @xmath76 but also that of @xmath30 for @xmath7 generic : this of course contradicts our result in ( [ exoticcoho ] ) ) ] .",
    "we do not have yet a definite understanding of this conflict .",
    "the discussion we presented above makes it clear that the only reasonable way to avoid our conclusion regarding cohomologies at non - standard ghost numbers is that level truncation is simply not appropriate to study the spectrum of osft at @xmath77 , regardless of the level . in other words",
    "one has to admit that the approximately degenerate multiplets of poles that we detected are a finite level artifact that have no correspondence in the exact theory .",
    "we just reviewed the reasons why this , although possible in principle , seems difficult to understand .    on the other hand",
    ", it should be remarked that the proof presented in @xcite has a somewhat formal character .",
    "the reason is that the identity state is not a completely `` good '' state of osft star algebra , since it has several `` anomalous '' properties , discussed for example in @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the argument of @xcite is that any  state @xmath78 which is @xmath8-closed is also @xmath8-exact since eqs .",
    "( [ istate ] ) and ( [ astate ] ) imply = ( a ) the question we are raising therefore is if the state @xmath72 is well - defined or , more precisely , if the star product of @xmath72 with _ any _ string field is well - defined .",
    "we think this question deserves further investigation . here , we limit ourselves to observe that the assumption of the existence of the identity leads to consequences that look quite dramatic from the point of view of the gauge - fixed second quantized theory .",
    "we explained that the absence of physical states is a statement regarding the null vectors of the gauge - fixed kinetic operators @xmath79 for _ any _ @xmath14 , _ any _ ghost number @xmath7 and _ any _ lorentz quantum number .",
    "now , assuming that the identity state does exist , one could consider , in analogy with ( [ astate ] ) , the following state = 1 b_0 [ atildestate ] then a = - p _ [ atildetrivial ] where @xmath80 is the projector on the subspace @xmath81 of states that are in the kernel of @xmath43 , have momentum @xmath82 , ghost number -1 and are twist - parity even lorentz scalars .",
    "therefore if @xmath81 is empty , @xmath83 trivializes the identity . in other words",
    ", the existence of the identity implies that a property of the propagators at @xmath38 in some definite lorentz and ghost sector  the vanishing of @xmath81  would determine the behaviour of the propagators for all @xmath14 and all quantum numbers .",
    "this seems a very ( and maybe too ) strong statement and , we feel , suggests caution when manipulating the identity .",
    "note that the vanishing of @xmath81 is a question that _ can _ reliably addressed in the lt expansion , since it involves a sector with vanishing momentum , definite twist parity , lorentz and ghost quantum numbers . to test",
    "the emptiness of @xmath81 it is enough to compute the determinants of the twist - even scalar kinetic operators at zero momentum and ghost number -1 and -2 .",
    "in fact , this is a very particular case of the computation we performed in this paper ( and in @xcite , for that matter ) . for @xmath82",
    "our level 10 approximation should by all means be reliable : the same sector ( but with ghost number 0 ) is the one where the same approximation turned out to capture quite accurately the properties of the stable classical vacuum solution .",
    "since we have not detected any zeros of the determinants of the twist - even scalar kinetic operators ( for both ghost numbers -1 and -2 ) at @xmath38 , we can confidently assert that @xmath81 is empty .",
    "in this sense therefore the numerical computations presented both in this paper and in @xcite are coherent with what proven in @xcite .",
    "if the expression in eqs .",
    "( [ atildestate ] ) ( analogous to eqs.([astate ] ) ) defined a `` good '' state , our numerical computations , when restricted to @xmath82 , ghost number -1 , and to the twist - even scalar sector , could be interpreted as a reliable numerical proof of the triviality of the identity .",
    "the extension of the same analysis to non - vanishing @xmath14 appears to contradict this conclusion , however : in summary , this might signals either a failure of lt when extended to @xmath84 or the formal character of expressions like ( [ atildestate ] ) and ( [ astate ] ) .    in order to elucidate this question it should be helpful to extend our computations to gauges different than the siegel gauge .",
    "this would allow testing the gauge invariant meaning of the propagator double poles .",
    "we leave this to future work .",
    "we add a final comment .",
    "in @xcite the spectrum of osft around so - called universal solutions was studied analytically .",
    "it was found there that for such background while @xmath85 vanishes , brs cohomologies with ghost number -1 and -2 are not empty .",
    "although this result is intriguingly reminiscent of ours , it also differs from it in various respects .",
    "cohomologies at non - standard ghost numbers around the universal solutions are isomorphic to perturbative , ghost number zero , cohomologies .",
    "in particular they exist for @xmath86 .",
    "we do not find cohomologies for @xmath87 .",
    "moreover the cohomologies that we do find at @xmath88 do not have the same quantum numbers as the perturbative ones .",
    "more work is needed to understand the relation , if there is one , between cohomologies around the stable classical solution and around universal solutions .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : reviewgaugefixing ] we briefly review , for self - containedness , the gauge - fixing procedure of osft in the classical stable vacuum . in section [ sec : relabscohomologies ] we derive , relaxing the additional technical assumptions of @xcite , the long exact cohomology sequence ( [ nonpertbottsequenceintro ] ) . in section [ sec : numerical ] we report the result of our numerical level ( 10,30 ) computation . in section [ sec : qaction ] we work out the unique action ( [ mhataction ] ) of @xmath55 on the null vectors of the gauge - fixed kinetic operators , which should correspond , in the exact theory , to the approximately degenerate propagators poles found in section [ sec : numerical ] .",
