    "in this paper , we discuss the analytical structure of the three - point function at finite temperature .",
    "we consider bosonic fields and work in the real time formalism . throughout this paper",
    "we use the keldysh or closed time path ( ctp ) formalism @xcite .",
    "the integration contour has one branch running from negative infinity to positive infinity , and a second branch running backwards from positive infinity to negative infinity .",
    "we call the top branch of this contour @xmath0 and the bottom branch @xmath1",
    ". the arguments of the fields can take values on either branch of this contour .",
    "this choice of contour then leads to a doubling of degrees of freedom .",
    "historically , the real time formalism has been much less popular than the imaginary time formalism because of the mathematical difficulties associated with the doubling of degrees of freedom . however , in some cases calculations in the real time formalism are much simpler . in particular , the real time formalism is extremely useful when working with ultra soft external energy scales .",
    "examination of the pole structure of the internal propagators allows one to identify infinite sets of graphs that contribute to the same order in perturbation theory .",
    "for example , in a theory with an interaction of the form @xmath2 , the ladder graphs contribute terms to the self energy of order @xmath3 when the number of loops @xmath4 is larger than 1 @xcite .",
    "when the pole structure of all propagators is explicit it is easy to extract the piece of each graph that dominates when @xmath5 . in order to obtain complete results ,",
    "all such contributions must be resummed .",
    "this requires an efficient and economic set of calculational tools for real - time perturbation theory to which we wish to contribute with the present paper .",
    "the analytic structure of the three - point vertex at finite temperature has been studied previously in several publications , both in imaginary time @xcite and real time @xcite .",
    "the real time formulation has the advantage that it avoids the need for analytic continuation to real frequencies which , for higher order @xmath6-point functions , can easily become a source of confusion .",
    "its disadvantage is the occurrence of many different thermal components of the @xmath6-point functions which results from the doubling of degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting proliferation of terms in real - time calculations has contributed considerably to the lack of popularity of the real - time formalism . in the actual calculations",
    "one finds , however , that a large number of terms cancel in the end .",
    "the vertex representations found in the previous papers @xcite do not implement these cancellation mechanisms at all , or only incompletely .",
    "we derive here a different ( though mathematically equivalent ) decomposition and spectral representation of the real - time three - point vertex at finite temperature .",
    "we demonstrate that it leads to impressive simplifications in perturbative calculations by making the physical cancellations explicit on an algebraic level in the first step of the calculation , thereby dramatically reducing the number of terms which need to be evaluated .",
    "to establish our notation and for later use we first consider the single - particle propagator . in real time , the propagator has @xmath7 components , since each of the two fields can take values on either branch of the contour .",
    "thus , the two - point function can be written as a @xmath8 matrix of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the propagator for fields moving along @xmath0 , @xmath11 is the propagator for fields moving from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , etc .",

    "these four components satisfy @xmath15 as a consequence of the identity @xmath16 .",

    "( [ eq : kmsd ] ) we further obtain @xcite @xmath30 for later use we give the decomposition of the inverse propagator : @xmath31 these representations are very useful for doing calculations in real time .",
    "similar relations can be obtained for the polarization tensor , although they are perturbatively less useful . the polarization tensor is the 1pi two - point function and is obtained by amputating the external legs from the single - particle propagator .",
