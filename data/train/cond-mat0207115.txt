    "among the several advances in the study of large - spin molecular magnets in the last few years  @xcite , perhaps the most remarkable is the observation of quenching of spin tunneling in the molecule [ fe@xmath0o@xmath1(oh)@xmath1(tacn)@xmath2@xmath3 ( or just 8 for brevity ) by wernsdorfer and sessoli ( ws )  @xcite .",
    "the spin of this molecule can tunnel between classically degenerate orientations , but for certain values of the applied magnetic field , it is found that the tunneling is eliminated , or quenched . between quenching points ,",
    "the tunnel splitting oscillates as a function of applied field .",
    "the simplest model that is capable of describing this effect has been studied by many workers now  , and it is well understood qualitatively in terms of an interference between tunneling feynman paths . such interference can also arise for massive particles in more than one dimension  @xcite .",
    "it arises in the case of a single spin because the kinetic term in the path integral has a geometrical or berry phase structure  @xcite .",
    "there is , however , yet another aspect of the 8 experiments that has not been widely appreciated , because of which the physical explanation for the tunnel splitting oscillations is significantly incomplete .",
    "this is because if we view the tunneling in terms of just the interfering paths , the geometrical interpretation of the relative phase between them inevitably predicts a certain number  ten  of quenching points .",
    "experimentally , and by numerical diagonalization of the appropriate model hamiltonian , only four quenching points are seen .",
    "we will show in this paper that the resolution of this apparent paradox requires that we include paths that have _ discontinuities _ at the end points . as a general point",
    ", the necessity of including such paths in the spin - coherent - state path integral has in fact been known for some time  @xcite , but the significance of this idea has not progressed much beyond the purely formal level , and the one concrete problem where discontinuous paths are known to be needed  larmor precession in a constant magnetic field  is so well understood to begin with , that few people have pursued this line of inquiry further .",
    "the 8 problem has provided us with a strong motivation for doing just that , thus enhancing our understanding of the spin - coherent - state path integral . in turn",
    ", we can now see that discontinuous paths exist in all other coherent - state path integrals too , and this may prove to be of use in situations where such path integrals are the natural analytic tool .",
    "there are , therefore , two points to this paper .",
    "first , as already stated , is to advance our understanding of the spin - coherent - state path integral .",
    "second , we obtain a _ quantitative _ analytical explanation for additional aspects of ws s data that are not captured by the simple model , and that have up till now been only understood numerically .",
    "this is desirable as the oscillations seen in 8 are , to date , the clearest evidence for spin tunneling of a spin of such large magnitude .",
    "this may be a good point to ask why one should bother with an analytical explanation at all .",
    "after all , the model hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) given below can be numerically diagonalized with minimal effort",
    ". a numerical diagonalization by itself gives no insight into the results , however , and if it were the only way we had of solving the problem , the oscillations in the splitting would be a complete mystery . if one believes that the mental picture of interfering tunneling paths is useful , then it is surely important to know if and when and how this picture breaks down .",
    "secondly , the numerical approach can not by itself explain the scale of the tunnel splitting .",
    "a shorter paper with our results has been published previously  @xcite . in the present paper , in addition to providing the details of the work , we explain how to find the end points of the discontinuous paths or boundary jump instantons , as we refer to them .",
    "we also discuss the general model for parameter values other than those relevant to 8 in order to further test the scenario for the elimination of quenching points .",
    "finally , we show that the number of quenching points that remain must be even or odd depending on the value of the spin , @xmath4 , and how this comes about from the instanton analysis .      the main facts about 8 are as follows .",
    "the cluster of eight fe@xmath5 ions in one molecule has an approximate @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "competing exchange interactions among the ionic spins in one molecule lead to a ground state with a total spin of @xmath7 .",
    "the compound forms a well ordered crystalline solid , in which the magnetic ions in one molecule are kept well separated from those in another molecule by large organic ligands .",
    "the magnetic degrees of freedom may thus be treated as a set of non - interacting spins , each with @xmath7 . to a first approximation",
    ", the anisotropy of each molecule may be described by the hamiltonian _",
    "0 = - k_2 j_z^2 + ( k_1- k_2 ) j_x^2 - g _ b . [ ham ] here , @xmath8 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath9 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath10 are anisotropy parameters . is the simplest hamiltonian that can describe the quenching effect .",
    "viewed as a classical hamiltonian , it has two degenerate ground states at the points @xmath11 in the absence of an applied field .",
    "these states are separated by a barrier @xmath12 along the @xmath13-axis , and @xmath14 along the @xmath15-axis .",
    "quantum mechanics admixes these states via tunneling  @xcite . when the field is non - zero ,",
    "the classical minima are no longer along @xmath16 , but they are still degenerate if @xmath17 , the easy axis , and one can have tunneling between the corresponding quantum mechanical states .",
    "more generally , one can have tunneling between excited states in the two wells . in this paper , however , we will only consider @xmath18 , and tunneling between the lowest two states . in this case , the quenching points are perfectly regularly spaced , and are located at h_x = ( j - n - ) h_x^(0 ) , n = 0 , 1 ,  , 2j - 1 , [ dploc ] where the spacing or period is given by h_x^(0 ) = jh_c , [ per0 ] where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "( these , and other important parameter combinations are tabulated in table [ parcomb ] . )",
    ".[parcomb]important parameter combinations [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note in passing that although this and similar results for other quenching points were initially obtained by various semiclassical approximations @xcite , they are in fact exact  @xcite for the model ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "ws s observations differ from the simple model predictions in that they see only four quenching points on the positive @xmath21 axis , where the simple model would say ten , and the spacing between these points is more than 50% greater than the formula ( [ per0 ] ) would give .",
    "( see . )    at the same time , this spacing is quite uniform .",
    "they surmise that the differences are due to the presence of higher order anisotropy terms in the hamiltonian consistent with the symmetry of the molecule , and by trial and error and numerical diagonalization of a @xmath22 matrix , they discover that their data can be very well fit by the following model hamiltonian @xcite = -k_1 j_z^2 + ( k_1-k_2 ) j_x^2 - c [ j_+^4 + j_-^4 ] - g _ b .",
    "[ ham1 ] the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are known through a variety of experimental evidence  @xcite .",
    "we will use the values used by ws : @xmath25 , @xmath26  k , @xmath27  k , and @xmath28k .",
    "it turns out to be important that one needs @xmath29 .",
    "this , then , describes the problem that we wish to solve .",
    "one point to note is that the dimensionless strength of the fourth order anisotropy @xmath30 is _ 2=cj^2/k_1 .",
    "for the 8 parameter values , @xmath31 .",
    "that such a small term should have such a large effect ( elimination of six quenching points , 50% increase in period ) , suggests that it is a singular perturbation .",
    "we shall see that this is indeed true when we analyze its effect on the semiclassical paths , although the perturbation is perfectly well behaved from the quantum mechanical operator point of view .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ instformal ] we briefly review the formalism of su(2 ) instantons with special emphasis on the jump instantons . to this end , we first discuss ( sec .  [ scsparam ] ) stereographic coordinates for the unit sphere , the corresponding parametrization of spin coherent states , and how paths on the complexified unit sphere are represented in terms of stereographic as well as the usual spherical polar coordinates .",
    "we then discuss ( sec .",
    "[ spinaction ] ) the action functional for spin , and show that unless one includes a  boundary term \" that depends explicitly on the boundary values of the spin path , there is no sensibly formulatable least action principle , nor is there a solution to the euler - lagrange equations in general .",
    "paths with discontinuities arise naturally once a boundary term is included .",
    "we also discuss klauder s formulation of these points in terms of an extra infinitesimal pseudo - inertial term in the kinetic energy and the concomitant production of narrow boundary layers in the spin paths . in the limit where the extra kinetic energy term vanishes",
    ", the width of these layers also vanishes , and they then look like discontinuities in the paths .    in sec .",
    "[ strucans ] , we discuss the general structure of the tunnel splitting for the model ( [ ham1 ] ) when both types of instantons  with and without jumps  are allowed .",
    "we shall see that an instanton of the latter type dominates as the field gets large , and since this instanton has no interfering partner , we see why the splitting ceases to oscillate after fewer than ten quenching points have been realized .    in sec .",
    "[ fe8anal ] we present the explicit analysis for our model for 8 , . in sec .",
    "[ period ] we analyse the interfering instantons .",
    "we identify @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 ) as the appropriate small parameter , and explain why the @xmath21 spacing of the quenching points is so regular .",
    "we obtain a concrete formula for this spacing , namely , h_x = h_c j i(,_2 ) , [ per1 ] where @xmath34 is an integral expression [ see ] depending on the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( see also table [ parcomb ] ) . with the parameter values relevant to 8 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath37 , giving @xmath38  t. ws quote a period of 0.41  t. compared to the model @xmath39 , the period is increased by a factor @xmath40 .",
    "we relate @xmath34 to a complete elliptic integral , and give various formulas for it in the appendix . in sec .",
    "[ bjinsts ] we turn to the jump instantons .",
    "we first formulate the equations for determining the endpoints of these instantons .",
    "in general these equations would have to be solved numerically , but for the 8 model , it turns out that an analytical solution can be found . with these endpoints in hand , we can find the complete instantons and their actions ( this must still be done numerically ) .",
    "we use our computed actions for all the instantons to find the splitting as a function of magnetic field , and compare with the numerical diagonalization .",
    "this exercise is carried out for the value of @xmath41 applicable to 8 , as well as some others .    in sec .",
    "[ nquench ] we address the issue of the number of quenching points in light of general quantum mechanical theorems .",
    "it is not an accident that ws see an even number ( four ) of quenchings for @xmath42 .",
    "we will see that the general theorems constrain this number for any value of @xmath4 , and then show how this same conclusion comes about from the instanton analysis .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "[ concl ] with a summary and discussion .",
    "the instanton method is an efficient way of calculating tunnel splittings , both for particles  @xcite and for spin  @xcite .",
    "it is based on evaluating the path integral for a certain propagator in the steepest - descent approximation , and is designed to be asymptotically correct in the semiclassical limit ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) .",
    "instantons are classical paths that run between degenerate classical minima of the energy . by",
    " classical \" we mean that the path obeys the principle of least action , and , _ a fortiori _ , satisfies energy conservation .",
    "however , a path along which energy is conserved can not run between two minima and still have real coordinates and momenta .",
    "hence , one must enlarge the notion of a classical path , and allow the coordinates and/or momenta to become complex .",
    "one is naturally led in this way to reexamine the least action principle . in the case of spin",
    ", there is yet another reason for this reexamination , as we shall see .",
    "more specifically , let the degenerate classical energy minima be along the directions @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we seek the propagator k_fi = [ kfimel ] in the limit @xmath47 . here",
    ", @xmath48 are spin coherent states ( defined below ) .",
    "this propagator is given by the path integral k_fi = [ ( t ) ] e^-s[(t ) ] , [ kfipath ] where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the ( euclidean ) action .",
    "when we evaluate this integral by steepest descents , least action paths emerge naturally .",
    "we define the spin coherent state @xmath52 as the state with maximal spin projection along the direction @xmath53 . in other words",
    ", @xmath53 is an eigenstate of @xmath54 with eigenvalue @xmath4 : = j .",
    "[ def_scs ] the most common way of explicitly writing @xmath52 and @xmath55 $ ] is in terms of the spherical polar coordinates @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the direction @xmath53 . for formal purposes ,",
    "another representation is more convenient .",
    "let @xmath58 be a complex number , related to @xmath59 by the stereographic map z = e^i .",
    "[ defstereo ] then , up to normalization and phase , @xmath52 is identical to the state  @xcite = e^zj_- .",
    "[ defketz ] the advantage of this representation is that matrix elements of various operators have nice analyticity properties .",
    "for example , for hamiltonians polynomial in the components of @xmath60 , h(|z , z ) = is holomorphic in @xmath58 and antiholomorphic in @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the formal complex conjugate of @xmath58 . in equations",
    ", this means that h(|z , z ) = z h(|z , z ) = 0 .",
    "[ hanal ] explicit model calculations , however , are often easier in @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    since we will be considering paths on the complexified unit sphere , it is useful to understand what this means in terms of the two coordinate systems",
    ". let @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 be cartesian coordinates in three - dimensional space .",
    "the real unit sphere is the surface specified by u^2 + v^2 + w^2 = 1 .",
    "[ unitsph ] the complexified unit sphere is obtained by allowing @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 to become complex .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of provide two constraints among six variables ( the real and imaginary parts of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ) , leaving us with a four - dimensional manifold .",

    "consider the former first .",
    "we relate them to cartesian coordinates in the usual way ( u , v , w ) = ( , , ) . is automatically satisfied .",
    "this continues to be true if we allow @xmath56 and @xmath57 to be complex .",
    "once again , we conclude that four real quantities are required to specify a point on this manifold .",
    "let us consider stereographic variables next . since z = e^i , |z = e^-i , we see that if @xmath56 and @xmath57 are complex , @xmath66 will not be the same as @xmath67 , the true complex conjugate of @xmath58 . to specify a point on the complex unit sphere , both @xmath58 and @xmath66",

    "conversely , a point with stereographic coordinates @xmath68 lies on the real unit sphere ( which is a submanifold of the complex unit sphere ) if @xmath58 and @xmath66 are complex conjugates .",

    "if we vary the path @xmath75 , @xmath74 , _ including the endpoints _ , and require the resulting variation @xmath79 to vanish , we discover ( i ) the euler - lagrange ( el ) equations = ( 1 + z)^2 2j h z , z = -(1 + z)^2 2j h , [ elzz ] and ( ii ) that @xmath79 has no terms proportional to @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "this means that the action evaluated for the classical path @xmath82 , @xmath83 [ which obeys ] is not a function of @xmath84 and @xmath85 : = z_f = 0 .",

    "[ in spherical polar coordinate language , we must allow both @xmath99 and @xmath100 to become complex . ]",
    "we thus see that if we want to consider classical dynamics for spin from the viewpoint of a least action principle , we must allow the dynamics to live on the complexified unit sphere from the very outset .",
    "we have couched the above discussion in language following faddeev  @xcite .",
    "it is also useful to discuss klauder s resolution of these issues  @xcite . on the face of it ,",
    "his treatment is slightly different , but turns out to be equivalent to faddeev s in actual applications .",
    "klauder does not include an explicit boundary term in @xmath51 , but argues that since the continuum path integral is a formal construct with meaning only as a limit of its discrete version , one may add a term to the integrand for @xmath101 that is quadratic in the velocities @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and which has an infinitesimal coefficient @xmath104 .",
