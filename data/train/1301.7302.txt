    "after observation of the smallest neutrino oscillation by daya bay  @xcite for the first time at the c.l . of @xmath1 , and immediately further confirmed by reno  @xcite , dozens of solar , atmospheric , reactor , and accelerator - based neutrino experiments have compellingly provided us with solid information on five physical parameters involving three active flavors of massive neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the three mixing angles quantify the difference between the flavor and mass eigenstates of the three generations of neutrinos and the amplitude of neutrino oscillations ; the two independent mass squared differences are directly connected to neutrino mass spectrum and crucial to the oscillation frequencies in neutrino experiments .",
    "although our knowledge on neutrinos in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has achieved great progress , many basic properties of these magic particles are unclear and to be explored , e.g. , their absolute masses , the mechanism for their tiny masses , and cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "one puzzle on neutrinos is the long - standing lsnd anomaly  @xcite , which points to the existence of one ev scale neutrino and can not be accommodated in the three - neutrino paradigm .",
    "the anomalous @xmath2 in lsnd motivated the miniboone experiment  @xcite , whose latest low energy data support the lsnd result , although the neutrino and antineutrino mode of the miniboone experiment are incompatible to a large extent  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recalculation of the reactor @xmath3 flux indicates the anomalous @xmath3 disappearance  @xcite , i.e. , the so - called `` reactor anomaly '' .",
    "the gallium radioactive source experiments gallex and sage  @xcite have also reported hints of @xmath4 disappearance , corresponding to the ev scale neutrino oscillation .",
    "in addition , cosmological data on cosmological microwave background , large scale structure , and the hubble constant imply extra light degrees of freedom  @xcite , and light extra neutrinos beyond the three in the sm are convincingly the most natural candidate .",
    "all these hints of extra neutrinos , however , are restricted by , e.g. , the icarus@xcite and @xmath5 scattering  @xcite data .    due to the stringent limit on the @xmath6 boson decay width  @xcite ,",
    "the extra light neutrinos can not directly participate in the weak interaction and is consequently sterile .",
    "the simplest extension of the lepton sector is the addition of one sterile flavor to the three active ones , i.e. , the resultant ( 3 + 1 ) neutrino model . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the simplest extension , although introducing more sterile states may reconcile comparatively better the data sets on sterile neutrinos and obtain a more preferable goodness - of - fit  @xcite .",
    "neutrino mass matrix @xmath0 with texture zeros , i.e. , vanishing elements , is an attractive framework to phenomenologically study neutrinos and the connection of neutrino physics to sm and new physics beyond sm .",
    "texture zero structures imply the underlying flavor symmetry or mechanism  @xcite , e.g. , the @xmath7 symmetry or froggatt - nielsen mechanism  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , with vanishing elements in @xmath0 , the physical parameters on neutrino mass , mixing and cp violation are always connected to each other .",
    "the framework of texture zeros have been intensively studied in the three - neutrino frame  @xcite and it can likewise apply to the ( 3 + 1 ) model with an extra sterile neutrino  @xcite . in the ( 3 + 1 ) model , if all the four neutrino states are of majorana type , the neutrino mass matrix @xmath0 has ten independent elements , @xmath8 compared to six in the three - neutrino scheme .",
    "ghosh  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has recently investigated the ( 3 + 1 ) model with two zeros , analyzing systematically all the @xmath9 distinct textures .",
    "they found that the 15 textures with both the two zeros in the active sector ( the first three rows and columns ) of @xmath0 are compatible with current neutrino data , whereas the 30 with zero(s ) in the sterile sector ( the fourth row and column ) are excluded by experiments mainly due to the mass hierarchy between the active and sterile neutrinos .",
    ", as well as one matrix element in the active sector , vanishes , one resultant possibility is that the mixing angle @xmath10 is close to zero .",
    "as the short baseline experiments are not sensitive to the tauon flavor , the vanishing of @xmath10 is allowed  @xcite and it is yet immature to assert that such textures are excluded . see the following analytical and numerical discussions for details . ]    in the presence of cp violation phases , one zero in @xmath0 generally imposes two correlation conditions on the parameters on neutrino masses , mixing angles and cp violating phases , i.e. , one is related to the vanishing absolute value and another to the vanishing argument . in general , more zeros means more stringent constraints on neutrino parameters and consequently more accurate predictions . in this work we focuses on @xmath11 neutrino mass matrices with three vanishing elements , assuming all the four neutrino states are of majorana type . as a comparison ,",
    "none of the 20 @xmath12 mass matrices with three zeros are compatible with current data  @xcite .",
    "adding one sterile neutrino , the number of possible textures with three zeros sum up to @xmath13 and this work aims to investigate the feasibility of three zero textures in the ( 3 + 1 ) scheme and explore their phenomenological implications .",
    "some elements of the lepton mixing matrix are more lengthy in the ( 3 + 1 ) model than in the three neutrino scheme  @xcite and resultantly most of the elements of @xmath0 become even more lengthy . however , due to the large mass hierarchy between the sterile and active neutrinos @xmath14 and the smallness of the angles governing reactor mixing  @xcite and active - sterile mixing ( asm )  @xcite , the vanishing conditions @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) can be unbelievably simplified and we arrive at clean expressions for the three asm angles . based on these expressions",
    "we predict the restricted ranges of the asm angles and other phenomenological observables , e.g. , the effective majorana electron neutrino mass @xmath17 in neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we also numerically analyse these textures and study their phenomenological implications .",
    "we apply experimental constraints on the five active neutrino oscillation parameters , making use of the @xmath19 ranges from ref .",
    "@xcite , and examine which textures can accommodate the ev scale sterile neutrino mass and @xmath200.1 asms implied by short baseline ( sbl ) experiments .",
    "the sterile neutrino fits  @xcite are somehow different from each other due to variations of the experimental data and calculation procedure , and we assign the fit in ref .  @xcite as the criterion on the three parameters : lsnd mass square difference @xmath21 , the asm angle @xmath22 relating @xmath4 and @xmath23 , and @xmath24 relating @xmath25 and @xmath23 .",
    "specifically , as cosmological data prefer lighter neutrino states , we use the @xmath19 parameter regions in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 planes with @xmath28 @xmath21 in fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effective mixing angles are defined as @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "sbl experiments are not sensitive to the neutrino of tauon flavor , then the constraint on the third asm angle @xmath10 is comparatively rather loose , @xmath31  @xcite . in our numerical calculation ,",
    "all the randomly generated parameters constrained by experiments are evenly distributed in their @xmath19 ranges .",
    "other parameters , e.g. , the cp violating phases @xmath32 , have not been determined at the @xmath19 c.l .",
    "if they are randomly generated , we assume they distribute evenly in their logically allowed ranges , e.g. , @xmath33 $ ] .",

    "we also sketch the current experimental constraints on the neutrino parameters .      assuming the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal and positive - definite , the @xmath11 majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath34 can be expressed as , in the flavor basis , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the diagonal neutrino matrix in the mass basis , and @xmath37 is the @xmath11 pmns lepton mixing matrix . in general ,",

    "<S> the analytical expressions can be greatly simplified . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically examine all the 120 texture zeros , via both analytical and numerical analysis , and find that the 100 textures with zeros in the fourth column and row of @xmath0 can hardly be compatible with experiments ; whereas , 19 of the other 20 are feasible . </S>",
