    "designing protocols of quantum information processing one usually deals with some particular initial states .",

    "such random states are also of a direct physical interest since they arise under the action of a typical quantum chaotic system  see e.g.  @xcite . in this work",

    "another set of monotones may be constructed out of symmetric polynomials of the schmidt coefficients of order @xmath19  @xcite , @xmath20 for large @xmath21 these polynomials become small , so it is of advantage to consider cognate quantities , @xmath22 .",
    "gour noted that taking the @xmath21-th root of the polynomials does not spoil the monotonicity and proposed to used normalized quantities @xmath23 as alternative measures of quantum entanglement  @xcite .",

    "if @xmath164 is even and we put @xmath170 , then the ratio @xmath171 is equal to @xmath172 and in the asymptotic limit @xmath173 the concurrence concentrates around the mean   which depends only on the asymmetry @xmath16 of the splitting .    our research may also be considered as a contribution to the random matrix theory : we have found the distribution of the determinants of random wishart matrices @xmath33 , normalized by fixing their trace .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the distribution of @xmath4-concurrence in the limit of large system sizes provides an illustrative example of the geometric concentration effect , since in high dimensions the distribution of the determinant is well localized around the mean value .",
    "this observation can also be related to the central limit theorem applied to logarithms of the eigenvalues of a density matrix , the sum of which is equal to the logarithm of the determinant .",

    "of course we made an approximation , but we know that the formula we ended up matches the correct result ( @xmath181 for @xmath182 ) in the point @xmath183 , so that such approximation would hold close to that point . now we observe that @xmath180 has poles only in @xmath184 , so that our contour of integration can be modified provided that we do not cross the origin , and we do so obtaining @xmath185 where @xmath186 is now the contour that , starting from @xmath177 get close to the negative real axis on the asymptotic left  lower quarter ",
