    "a qubit unlike a classical bit can exist in a state @xmath0 that is a superposition of two orthogonal basis states @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 . the fact that qubits can exist in these superposition states gives quantum information unusual properties .",
    "specifically , information encoded in quantum system has to obey rules of quantum physics which impose strict bounds on possible manipulations with quantum information .",
    "the common denominator of these bounds is that all quantum - mechanical transformations have to be represented by completely positive ( cp )  maps @xcite which in turn impose a constraint on the fidelity of quantum - mechanical measurements .",
    "that is , an unknown state of a qubit can not be precisely determined ( or reconstructed ) from a measurement performed on a finite ensemble of identically prepared qubits @xcite .",
    "in particular , the mean fidelity of the best possible ( optimal ) state estimation strategy based on the measurement of @xmath5 identically prepared qubits is @xmath6 .",

    "certainly if this would be possible , then one would be able to violate the bound on the fidelity of estimation .",

    "spin - flipping is indeed an _ anti - unitary _ , i.e. time reversal map @xmath10  which realizes for any input qubit the _ inversion _ over the bloch sphere , as shown in figure1 .",

    "namely , in the present context , what is the _ optimal _ universal cloning and the _ optimal _ universal - not ( u - not ) gate .",
