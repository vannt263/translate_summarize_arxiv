    "conversely , the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite provides deep insight in the limit of high dimensionality .",
    "however , the intermediate regime of two ( and three ) dimensions is less well understood , e.g. , with respect to pseudogap physics @xcite and high-@xmath0 superconductivity . in this paper , we will address another open question : the nature of the mott metal - insulator transition ( mit ) @xcite of the half - filled hubbard model in two dimensions ( @xmath1 ) .    as indicated by shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] , the hubbard model is insulating at half filling ( 1 electron per site ) and sufficiently strong coupling , in any dimension , while it is metallic at weak coupling  as long as the translational symmetry is not broken , e.g. , by magnetic order .",
    "for @xmath2 , one finds antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering @xcite , which implies insulating behavior , below the nel  temperature @xmath3 ( gray dash - dotted line ) .",
    "such long - range order is ruled out by the mermin - wagner theorem in @xmath1 ( at temperature @xmath4 ) .",
    "single - site dmft predicts a mit with critical interactions @xmath5 ( pink dotted line ) .",
    "this transition line is shifted to weaker interactions within cluster dmft ( cdmft ) , which includes short - range correlations on small clusters ( violet solid line ) @xcite .",
    "however , the low-@xmath6 metallic phase implied by the cdmft result is incompatible with several earlier studies highlighting effects of `` short - range antiferromagnetism '' @xcite .",
    "to clarify the situation , we apply the blankenbecler - scalapino - sugar quantum monte carlo ( bss - qmc ) @xcite approach with controlled multigrid extrapolation techniques to selected points in the phase diagram ( green crosses ) .",
    "we will show that these points are separated by a mit line ( or narrow crossover ) and conclude that the @xmath7 mott physics is quite similar to the @xmath8 case @xcite , in spite of the mermin - wagner theorem .",

    "to arrive at reliable conclusions regarding the mott transition using bss - qmc , one has first to eliminate all systematic errors ( finite - size as well as trotter errors ) and , secondly , calculate the self - energy on the matsubara axis , @xmath28 , from the imaginary - time green function in a stable manner .",
    "these steps are described in the following .",
