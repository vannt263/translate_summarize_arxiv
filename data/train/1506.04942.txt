    "many problems of consecutive random subdivision of a convex geometrical figure have been investigated by several authors since 1980s . in  @xcite ,",
    "g.  s.  watson introduced the following model : given an initial triangle , one chooses a point on each edge by keeping the same random proportion  @xmath1 and hence obtaining a new triangle .",
    "if one repeats the above process with independent identically distributed random proportions  @xmath3 then the limit triangle vanishes to the centroid of the initial triangle . to study the _ shapes",
    "_ of these triangles , let us rescale the newly formed in each step triangle in such a way that the largest side has length  @xmath4 .",
    "it is interesting that the `` limit '' of these rescaled triangles is non - vanishing and , in fact , random .",
    "veitch and watson in  @xcite also gave an extension for a system of points in higher dimensional real space .",
    "with the same motivation of random triangles , mannion in  @xcite studied the situation where on each step the triangle is formed by choosing three uniformly distributed random points inside the _ interior _ of the preceding triangle .",
    "the sides of these triangles almost surely converge to collinear segments .",
    "diaconis and miclo  @xcite considered a triangle split by the three medians such that one of the  @xmath5 triangles is chosen at random to replace the original triangle .",
    "it turns out that the limiting triangle s shape is flat .",
    "volkov in  @xcite discovered a similar phenomenon by considering a model where the new triangle is formed by choosing a random point uniformly and independently on each of the sides of the original triangle ; he also studied distribution of the `` middle '' point .    in the present paper",
    ", we give a generalization of volkov s result in  @xcite for all convex polygons and nearly all non - degenerate distributions of proportions in which the sides of the polygon are split .",
    "let us now formulate the model rigorously .",

    "let  @xmath7 be a convex  @xmath8-polygon ( i.e. , a convex polygon with  @xmath8 sides ) in the plane , with edges  @xmath9 , @xmath10 , with the convention  @xmath11 .",

    "it is easy to see that the polygons  @xmath23 become smaller and smaller and eventually converge to a point , however the behaviour of their _ shapes _ is less clear .",
    "to study the shapes we may , for example , place one of the vertices at the origin  @xmath24 and rescale the polygon in such a way that its longest edge has always length  @xmath4 .",
    "we will show that under some regularity conditions on the distribution of  @xmath1 the rescaled polygon will eventually become degenerate , i.e.  flat , in the sense that all of its vertices will be lying approximately along the same line ; observe that this is equivalent to the fact that the area of the rescaled polygon converges to  @xmath25 as  @xmath26 goes to infinity .",
    "let  @xmath27 , @xmath10 , be the vector corresponding to the  @xmath28-th side of  @xmath23 and  @xmath29 denote its cartesian coordinates . from elementary geometrical calculations",

    "in particular , @xmath38 where  @xmath39 and  @xmath40 is  @xmath41 vector with  @xmath4 on the  @xmath28-th place .",
    "note also that if the original polygon is non - degenerate then  @xmath42 and  @xmath43 are non - zero vectors for any  @xmath26 .    to ensure that  @xmath23 is a non - degenerate convex polygon and that the subdivision is genuinely random , we need the following    [ asu1 ] @xmath44 and the support of  @xmath1 contains at least two distinct points in  @xmath45 , i.e.  the distribution of  @xmath1 is non - degenerate .",
    "we can define `` thickness '' of a two - dimensional object as the smallest possible ratio between its one - dimensional projections on the two coordinate axes of a cartesian coordinate system ( where we can orient this system arbitrarily ) ; this quantity always lies between  @xmath25 and  @xmath4 ; moreover , it equals one for a circle , and it equals zero for any segment .",
    "the sequence of  @xmath23 converges to a  flat figure \" , or simply to  flatness \" , if the sequence of its thicknesses converges to zero . in the case of polygons ,",

    "indeed , intuitively , when some of the matrices in the product are not full rank , this should even be helpful for the convergence to lower - dimensional subspaces .",
    "however , in this case we would clearly not be able to form a group containing all the matrices in the support of the measure and hence can not use the standard results from the random matrix theory .",

    "<S> these new points form a new ( smaller ) polygon . by repeatedly implementing this procedure </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a sequence of random polygons . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to show that under very mild non - degenerateness conditions on  @xmath1 , the shapes of these polygons eventually become `` flat '' the convergence rate to flatness is also investigated ; in particular , in the case of triangles  ( @xmath2 ) , we show how to calculate the exact value of the rate of convergence , connected to lyapunov exponents . </S>",
