    "during the past decades , much attention has been paid to the phase behavior of ferromagnetic fluid models with coupled spin and spatial interactions [ 120 ] .",
    "the investigations have been carried out using the mean field ( mf ) theory @xcite , the method of integral equations , as well as monte carlo ( mc ) simulation techniques .",
    "they dealt mainly with simplified models belonging to a so - called ideal class of spin fluids , where the attractive part of nonmagnetic interactions is absent ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "moreover , these models were considered , as a rule , in the absence of an external magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) . at finite values of @xmath1 , it has been established @xcite that , depending on the relative strength of magnetic interactions , the gas , liquid , paramagnetic , and ferromagnetic states in the system may form phase diagrams of different topologies .",
    "for instance , an order - disorder liquid - liquid phase transition may appear additionally to the gas - liquid one .    a complete picture on the phase diagram topology",
    "can only be obtained if the field is included ( @xmath8 ) in the consideration .",
    "then the phase diagram shows the two other critical lines ( so called wings ) meeting the magnetic transition line in the @xmath4 plane at the tricritical liquid - liquid transition @xcite .",
    "the gas - liquid critical point extends to a critical line in the magnetic field .",
    "whether the gas - liquid or liquid - liquid critical line ends in a critical end point and the corresponding other critical line tends to infinite magnetic field depends on the model parameters mentioned .",
    "this enlarges the number of different `` phases '' in the global phase diagram ( the regions where the different topologies exist in the space of the microscopic model parameters , like interaction strength or range of the potentials ) .",
    "the global phase diagrams in one - dimensional @xmath1-domain were obtained for ising and heisenberg spin fluids within mf theory @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", no such diagrams have been investigated up to now using the integral equation method . as is well recognized , the latter method leads to more accurate predictions .",
    "it takes into account pair correlations between particles in spin space , which are completely ignored by the mf approach .",
    "previous integral equation studies on magnetic fluids have been restricted exclusively to ideal systems with heisenberg spin interactions in the absence of an external field @xcite or only included a few nonzero field values @xcite .",
    "no integral equation calculations have been performed for nonideal spin fluids at @xmath8 , even within the well - known ising model .",
    "note that here we are dealing with genuine fluid models , meaning that the spatial positions of spins are distributed continuously , contrary to simplified lattice gas schemes , where the spins are positioned on fixed lattice sites .    due to the discrete character of spin reorientations in the ising fluid",
    ", it can be mapped onto a binary nonmagnetic mixture with symmetric interparticle interactions . in this context , it should be pointed out that in recent years a lot of papers have been devoted to study phase properties in symmetric mixtures by means of mc simulations , the mf theory , as well as the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) integral equation method @xcite .",
    "various closure relations , including the standard mean spherical approximation ( msa ) @xcite and a self - consistent oz approach ( scoza ) @xcite , have been exploited within the latter method .",
    "note that these studies considered in fact only the case when the chemical potentials of different species are fixed to be equal . in the language of ising fluids this corresponds to the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "it has been realized that despite its relative simplicity , the msa is able to give reliable results for the coexistence phase boundaries including the location of critical points .",
    "the accuracy of the msa scheme gets worse only when calculating critical exponents . on the other hand",
    ", the more cumbersome scoza technique can provide us with highly precise results for the phase boundaries and it remains accurate even near criticality @xcite .",
    "the other concept is the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) @xcite , that combines features of the renormalization group theory ( rgt ) and theoretical liquid - state approaches and allows to reproduce some critical exponents more precisely with respect to the msa .",
    "for instance , the critical exponent @xmath9 ( which gives the curvature of the coexistence curve near the critical point ) takes the values 7/20 and 0.345 within the scoza and hrt , respectively .",
    "they are close to the experimental and rgt prediction @xmath10 , contrary to the mf and msa value @xmath11 ( see section iii.b ) .",
    "however , the scoza has so far been implemented only for a restricted class of hard - sphere - yukawa potentials . for these potentials ,",
    "some solutions within the msa ansatz can be derived @xcite in a semianalytical form as a set of nonlinear algebraic equations ( which should further be solved numerically ) .",
    "the scoza employs such solutions at an intermediate stage of the calculations . in the presence of potentials of any other structure , for instance , of lennard - jones ( lj ) type or potentials with a soft - core repulsion part , the mathematical structure is less amenable .",
    "in addition , the scoza enforces the consistency between different thermodynamic routes in a somewhat phenomenological manner by introducing an artificial `` temperature '' depending on density and concentration .",
    "the high level of sophistication of the scoza and hrt concepts leads , in turn , to substantial computational problems , when applying them to more realistic interaction potentials .",
    "therefore , for our problem we stick to a variant of the msa , being well aware of the properties of this approximation near the critical point .    in the present paper ,",
    "the global phase diagram of the ising fluid are investigated on the basis of the oz integral equation method with a soft msa closure .",
    "this allows us to obtain the complete thermal phase diagrams covering the whole range of the relative strength of magnetic interactions and other parameters of the interaction potentials .",
    "the dependencies of the critical temperatures and densities on the external field are analyzed in details as well .",

    "( [ eq2 ] ) , have been used for the sake of convenience of comparison of our results with previous predictions ( see section iii ) .",
    "then , for instance , the integrals @xmath29 and @xmath30 are independent of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . within the standard hard - sphere mf theory ( hsmf ) ,",
    "such integrals describe the contribution of the interactions to the free energy @xcite .",
    "thus , we can say in advance that the hsmf results will not dependent on @xmath31 . at @xmath32 ( the case which is usually considered in theory and simulation ) , the multipliers go to unity , and we come to the usual form for @xmath33 and @xmath34 . within the soft - core mf theory ( scmf ) , introduced recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , a slight @xmath31-dependency should appear .",
    "then the integrals transform to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the temperature with @xmath37 being boltzmann s constant , and @xmath38 is the function which takes into account the softness of repulsion potentials ( see eqs .",
    "( 8)-(10 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the integral equation approach",
    "we expect a more pronounced dependence of the results on @xmath31 .",
    "since the spins @xmath39 in an ising fluid take only two values , @xmath40 , we can map the system with @xmath17 particles carrying spin @xmath41 or @xmath42 onto a binary mixture with @xmath43 and @xmath44 particles of type @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , where @xmath47 .",

    ", we have to rewrite the energy , the magnetic field , and the magnetization per particle @xmath51 in terms of appropriate variables suitable for the mixture .",

    "one has the concentration relations @xmath55 in addition , we emphasize that due to a finite value of the external field term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , we have to deal with a mixture prepared in an unusual way",
    ". indeed , when transferring one particle from species @xmath45 to species @xmath46  in the ising liquid this amounts to flipping a spin from up to down and thus @xmath56  without changing the spatial coordinates , the total change in energy is equal to @xmath57 ( the other terms do not contribute to @xmath58 due to the symmetry @xmath59 of the particle interactions ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the change in energy of the mixture is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the chemical potentials of species @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "this leads to the identification @xmath63 condition ( [ eq14 ] ) can be considered as an additional constraint imposed on the concentration at given values of @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath0 , namely , @xmath66 .",
    "the reason for this procedure is the following .",
    "in the case of a magnetic fluid , the external field ( not the magnetization ) is accessible to experiment , whereas for a mixture it is the concentration ( note the chemical potentials ) . in order to study the ising fluid in the notation of binary mixture one ,",
    "therefore , has to fix the difference of the chemical potentials .      for mixtures",
    ", the oz integral equations have @xcite the form @xmath67 where the total @xmath68 and direct @xmath69 correlation functions for a pair of particles of species @xmath70 and @xmath9 will depend only on their separation distance , @xmath71 is the particle number density of the @xmath72-th species , and the indices @xmath70 , @xmath9 and @xmath72 accept two values , @xmath45 ( spin up ) and @xmath46 ( spin down ) .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) must be complemented by an ( approximate ) closure relation to be solved with respect to @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the standard msa scheme @xcite , proposed originally @xcite for systems with hs repulsion ( [ eq4 ] ) , should be replaced in our case by the soft msa ansatz ( smsa ) @xcite , appropriate for a sc potential ( [ eq3 ] ) .",

    "( [ eq8 ] ) leads to the hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the smsa additionally requires the separation of the total potential @xmath78 in its short- and long - ranged parts @xmath79 and @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "there is no general procedure to perform such a separation uniquely for arbitrary potentials .",
    "since the smsa itself is not exact , the yukawa potentials in the region of core repulsion @xmath82 allow splitting to some extent in various ways , leading to various versions of the smsa .",
    "usually the splitting is carried out by introducing a switch function .",
    "one choice among others is to extract the long - ranged part using the boltzmann - like switching exponent built on the soft - core potential , i.e. , @xmath83 \\exp[-\\beta \\varphi(r ) ] \\ , .\\ ] ] such an extraction is quite natural , because for @xmath84 the function @xmath85 rapidly tends with increasing @xmath86 to the yukawa potential @xmath87 $ ] ( we note that @xmath88=1 $ ] for @xmath89{2 } \\sigma$ ] , whereas @xmath90=0 $ ] ) . by the replacement @xmath91 , we come to the standard hs msa with @xmath92 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 $ ] for @xmath95 .",
    "another trick lies in a modification of the bridge function to the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) if @xmath96 and to @xmath97 when @xmath98 , that combines the smsa with the hnc approximation .",
    "this is in the spirit of the kh closure proposed by kovalenko and hirata @xcite .",
    "note that the pure smsa sometimes leads to unphysical @xmath86-domains with negative values of @xmath99 .",
    "the modified smsa preserves by construction the positiveness of @xmath99 everywhere in density and temperature space .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) constitute a system of six nonlinear integro - algebraic equations for the same number of unknowns @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "once the solutions are found , the thermodynamic quantities are calculated in a straightforward way .",
    "in particular , the pressure can be calculated from the virial equation of state @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "although the energy and compressibility routes can also be used , we will prefer the virial route ( [ eq13 ] ) because it is most easily implemented .",
    "the chemical potentials can be written in the form @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 being the de broglie thermal wavelength ( which is independent of @xmath64 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "explicit expressions for the excess part of @xmath108 can be derived using the ( exact ) kirkwood formula @xcite @xmath109 here , the integration over @xmath110 corresponds to the computation of the work of transferring a separate particle from a vacuum ( @xmath111 with @xmath112 ) to the system ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) . performing the @xmath110-integration in a manner similar to that proposed in refs .",

    "it is worth mentioning that since the correlation functions are calculated approximately , the above expressions ( 15 ) and ( 18 ) for the pressure and chemical potentials will not be thermodynamically self - consistent . in particular , the virial , energy and compressibility routes will lead to different results . although the differences are , as a rule , relatively small , they may distort the phase coexistence properties near a critical point .",
    "a derivation of the self - consistent expressions in the case of the nonideal ising model at the presence of the external field is a non - trivial problem that needs a separate serious investigation .",
    "it could be solved , for instance , within the scoza by extending its present implementation from hard - sphere to soft - core repulsion potentials . in this paper for the sake of simplicity we will use the virial pressure complemented by an appropriately chosen maxwell construction ( see subsection ii .",

    "it is convenient to replace @xmath61 and @xmath62 by the sum @xmath124 and the difference @xmath125 defined in ( [ eq14 ] ) .",

    "indeed , the gibbs free energy of the mixture @xmath132 can be rewritten in terms of @xmath133 and @xmath134 as @xmath135 , so that the introduced quantity @xmath136 ( eq .  ( 21 ) ) has the meaning of the chemical potential of the ising fluid .",
    "it can be calculated using expressions ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) [ which were already used when solving the external field constraint ( see eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 23 ) ] .",
    "alternatively , a maxwell - construction scheme has been utilized .",
    "in order to demonstrate that this scheme can be applied in its standard form to the magnetic fluid , let us consider the change in the gibbs free energy . according to the thermodynamic relations",

    "it follows that @xmath144 . since the increment caused by the change @xmath145 in the magnetic energy is the same for both routes , we come to the maxwell construction @xmath146 , where @xmath147 denotes the coexistence pressure",
    ". the construction guarantees that the chemical potential will be the same ( @xmath148 ) in both phases i and ii , so that the second line of eq .",
    "( 24 ) transforms to @xmath149 .",
    "in such a way , the gas - liquid and liquid - liquid phase transitions of the first order can be determined .",
    "the second - order para - ferro magnetic transition at @xmath4 can be found as a boundary ( curie ) curve @xmath150 . below this curve ,",

    "note that the trivial solution @xmath155 ( or @xmath156 ) appears as a result of the symmetry of the interparticle potentials ( eq .  ( [ eq6 ] ) ) .",
    "for the same reason , the coexistence phases will have an identical density at concentrations @xmath54 and @xmath157 , or at magnetizations @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "from the structure of eqs .",

    "therefore , the phase diagrams will be symmetric with respect to the magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "the set of oz integral equations ( [ eq7 ] ) was first reduced to a system of linear algebraic ones , @xmath161 , by applying the 3-dimensional fourier transform @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is any function of @xmath86 .",

    "the accuracy of the oz / smsa / fc approach when evaluating @xmath200 and @xmath201 is expected to be of order of 1015% , in a wide region of @xmath205-values .",

    "although here the both theories agree quite well , the scmf deviations from the mc data are , nevertheless , slightly larger than those of the oz / smsa / fc theory .",
    "the phase coexistences of the nonideal ising fluid with @xmath233 are shown in fig .",
    "5 for @xmath202 , when the ratio @xmath1 of strengths of the magnetic to nonmagnetic interaction is not too small .",
    "as can be seen , all the curves exhibit a tricritical point behavior  type i of the thermodynamic phase diagrams  of the same topology as the case @xmath7 . note that",
    "because of the great number of curves , the magnetic phase transition lines have been omitted in fig .  5 as well as in figs .",
    "they are presented in detail in fig .",
    "14 below .",
    "with further decreasing @xmath1 , the shape of the phase diagrams changes in a characteristic way .",
    "this is illustrated in subsets ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "beginning from the upper boundary value @xmath234 , beside the tricritical point ( tcp ) a gas - liquid critical point ( glcp ) appears in the paramagnetic phase region ( at smaller densities than the tricritical point density ) indicating that the nonmagnetic interaction is strong enough to condense here the system into the liquid phase .",
    "in addition , a triple point becomes visible .",
    "the tcp now corresponds to a liquid - liquid transition between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases .",
    "this is different from the phase behavior of type i in the region @xmath235 , where the tcp relates to the transition between a paramagnetic gas and a ferromagnetic liquid phase .",
    "such a new topology of the phase behavior below @xmath236 will be referred to as type ii .",
    "the appearance of the additional critical point with decreasing @xmath1 is explained by an increased weight of nonmagnetic attractions in the system .",
    "the nonmagnetic interaction is sufficiently strong to produce a gas - liquid transition before the liquid becomes ferromagnetic .",
    "if the nonmagnetic interaction becomes too strong , namely , when the value of @xmath1 is below the lower boundary level @xmath237 , i.e. , @xmath238 , the tcp disappears and transforms into a critical end point ( cep ) ( see subset ( b ) of fig .",
    "6 ) . at the same time",
    ", the glcp remains and further shifts away from the cep .",
    "such a topology of the phase diagram in the region @xmath239 will be defined as of type iii .",
    "note that for extremely small values of @xmath1 ( when @xmath240 ) , the phase coexistence will behave like that inherent in a simple nonmagnetic fluid ( because then @xmath241 and magnetic interactions can be ignored completely ) .",
    "these three phase diagram topologies at @xmath4 have been found earlier for other systems , such as symmetric binary nonmagnetic mixtures , the heisenberg fluid @xcite or the stockmayer fluid @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the boundary values @xmath242 and @xmath243 calculated by us within the oz / smsa / fc approach for the ising fluid correspond to @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "here @xmath246 denotes the ratio of interparticle potentials ( outside the hard or soft core ) between unlike and like ( see eq .",
    "( 6 ) , @xmath247 is proportional to the ratio @xmath248/[i(r)+j(r)]$ ] ) particles in the mixture .",
    "the latter values are very close to those ( @xmath249 and @xmath250 ) reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for a symmetric binary mixture and evaluated within the scoza technique ( the hrt yields @xmath251 @xcite ) .",
    "however , the direct comparison is not possible since we used the soft core potential instead of the hard sphere repulsion and another value of the inverse screening length @xmath252 .",
    "varying the parameter @xmath205 can lead to a qualitative modification of the phase diagrams and thus to a shift of the boundaries between different topologies .",
    "this is seen in fig .  7 , where the cases @xmath253 , @xmath41 , @xmath254 , and @xmath255 are considered at @xmath256 ( subset ( a ) ) and @xmath257 ( subset ( b ) ) . from the topologies of these diagrams",
    "it can be concluded that the upper @xmath258 and lower @xmath259 boundary values decrease with increasing @xmath260 .",
    "a more complicated situation arises when @xmath261 that is presented in fig .",
    ", the quantities @xmath236 and @xmath262 should be treated as depending on both inverse screening lengths @xmath204 and @xmath263 .",
    "analyzing the set of curves in fig .  8 , it can be stated that the behavior of @xmath264 and @xmath265 is not monotonic .",
    "in particular , the functions @xmath264 and @xmath265 increase with rising @xmath263 at fixed @xmath190 , but they decrease with increasing @xmath204 at constant @xmath266 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the above three types of the phase diagrams can also be observed within mf theory @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the mf description is that it produces boundary values @xmath236 and @xmath262 which are independent of @xmath204 and @xmath263 .",
    "this corresponds , in fact , to the limiting behavior of @xmath236 and @xmath262 at @xmath267 .      a set of phase diagrams for different values of the external field @xmath0 and relative strength @xmath1 of internal magnetic to nonmagnetic interactions",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    ", we can see that the change in @xmath0 modifies considerably the phase coexistence curves in the nonideal ising system . at large values of @xmath1 ,",
    "such modifications are similar to those of the ideal ising fluid ( compare , for example , the subset ( a ) of fig .  9 , @xmath268 , with the subset ( b ) of fig .  2 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "since there is no magnetic phase transition at finite fields , the tricritical point at @xmath202 transforms into a critical point for @xmath269 ( note that one has a phase diagram symmetric in @xmath270 ) and moves monotonically in the temperature - density plane with increasing @xmath0 to the side of lower @xmath271 and higher @xmath226 .",
    "this demonstrates that the critical lines meet in a tricritical point . at intermediate and small values of @xmath1 , the phase diagram modifications exhibit",
    "nonmonotonic features . for instance , at @xmath272 ( see subset ( c ) ) , the critical temperature , starting from the value @xmath273 at @xmath4 , begins first to go down , reaching a minimum at @xmath274 .",
    "further it increases up to its limiting value @xmath275 , where @xmath276 can be less ( subset ( c ) ) or greater ( subset ( d ) ) than @xmath273 .",
    "more complicated scenarios are observed for parameters @xmath277 ( the region of topologies of type ii ) , when the gas - liquid critical point exists simultaneously ( from the left in @xmath226-axis ) to the tricritical one .",
    "however , only one of these two critical points at @xmath4 can be connected by a critical line with the critical point at @xmath278 . with increasing @xmath0 , one of the two critical lines has to end .",
    "this is only possible in a critical end point .",
    "how this happens depends on the concrete value of @xmath1 ( see subsets ( e ) , ( f ) , and ( g ) of fig .",
    "9 ) . in the infinite field limit @xmath5 ,",
    "the phase diagrams tend at each @xmath1 to the gas - liquid binodals of a simple nonmagnetic fluid with the interparticle potential @xmath279 .",
    "this is because then all the spins align exactly along the field vector , so that the product @xmath280 will be equal to 1 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ) for any pair of particles .",
    "a similar behavior even for finite fields can be observed for regions with too low values of @xmath238 ( see subset ( h ) ) , where the influence of magnetic interactions can be neglected ( @xmath281 ) .",
    "the dependencies of the gas - liquid critical temperature @xmath282 , the liquid - liquid critical ( wing ) temperature @xmath283 and the corresponding densities @xmath284 and @xmath285 of the nonideal ising fluid on the value @xmath196 of the external field are shown in detail in figs .",

    "on the other hand , it has been realized that for sufficiently strong fields including the limit @xmath5 , we have a simple nonmagnetic - like phase behavior with the presence of only one gas - liquid transition ( see fig .",

    "as has been established , the oz / smsa / fc approach provides us with more accurate predictions in comparison to those of the mf theory and corroborates the mf global phase diagram , changing of course the boundary values of @xmath1 which separates the different topologies .",
    "it is expected that some other more complicated schemes , such as the scoza , for example , should lead to a higher precision of the calculations .",
