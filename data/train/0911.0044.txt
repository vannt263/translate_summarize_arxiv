    "in this paper we investigate colour - magnitude relations , and , to greater depth , the properties of radial colour gradients , for early - type galaxies and in particular brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "both can provide information on these objects formation .",
    "early - type galaxies ( elliptical and s0 ) with higher luminosities are redder in colour than those of lower luminosity , following a relatively tight and linear colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) , or ` red sequence ' .",
    "gallazzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) performed a detailed analysis of @xmath12 galaxy spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , using a set of 5 spectral indices ( d4000 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16^{\\prime}$ ] ) to estimate mean stellar ages and metallicities .",
    "gallazzi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and jimenez et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , from spectral analysis of the early - type galaxies , conclude that the slope of the red - sequence cmr is primarily caused by an increase in mean stellar metallicity with galaxy mass or velocity dispersion .",
    "mergers may then affect the cmr by building more luminous galaxies with the same composition as their less massive progenitors , which would tend to flatten the cmr slope at @xmath17 luminosities ( eg .",
    "skelton , bell and somerville 2009 ) .",
    "age also has a ( secondary ) role in explaining the colour trend - the most massive e / s0s formed early and rapidly ( in @xmath18 gyr ) , while those of lower luminosity formed stars over longer timescales , giving slightly younger flux - weighted ages .",
    "there is also evidence that e / s0 galaxy formation occurred slightly earlier in dense environments ( eg .",
    "sheth et al .",
    "2006 , bernardi 2009 ) , while galaxies in cluster centres may have had an unusual and extreme merger history ( e.g. boylan - kolchin , ma and quataert 2006 ) .",
    "thus merger history and cluster environment may both influence the cmr .",
    "our studies of the cmr in roche , bernardi and hyde 2009 ( hereafter paper i ) suggested ( see section 3.1 ) that the radial colour gradients in e / s0 galaxies might be correlated with their other properties and it would be fruitful to investigate this further .",
    "these colour gradients are of interest in that they are sensitive tracers of evolution processes and vary strongly between the individual e / s0s .",
    "most e / s0 galaxies have negative colour gradients , meaning that the centres are reddest and colours become bluer outwards .",
    "this could be the result of a negative gradient in age , metallicity or dust , or some combination of these .",
    "tamura et al . ( 2000 ) and tamura and ohta ( 2003 ) estimate the mean colour gradient in e / s0s as @xmath19 mag @xmath20 ( with a scatter of 0.04 ) , and attributed this to a radial gradient of metallicity ( rather than age ) @xmath21 , approximately constant to @xmath22 .",
    "( 2005 ) similarly estimated @xmath23 with a large scatter @xmath24 .",
    "mehlert et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found negative metallicity gradients in coma - cluster ellipticals , but negligible gradients in age or @xmath25/fe .",
    "michard ( 2005 ) concluded colour gradients in 50 nearby ellipticals were primarily due to metallicity gradients and the effects of dust were usually small .",
    "la barbera and carvalho ( 2009 ) compare optical and near - ir colour gradients and again conclude they are produced by negative gradients in metallicity ( they find the radial age gradients in e / s0s may be even be positive ) .",
    "kobayashi ( 2004 ) performed detailed chemodynamical simulations of a set of over 100 model elliptical galaxies , with star - formation and merging , and predicted that spheroidals which formed monolithically , or at least with only minor mergers , would have steeper metallicity gradients ( @xmath26 to -0.5 ) than those formed by major mergers ( @xmath27 . within the simulated galaxy set ,",
    "merger history was the primary determinant ( more so than mass or luminosity ) of present - day metallicity / colour gradient .",
    "this might account for the observed wide distribution in colour gradients if similar numbers of spheroidals had monolithic , minor - merger or major - merger histories , and might also lead to an environmental dependence .",
    "in this paper we focus especially on brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , of which several thousand have been identified in the sdss .",
    "previously , the bcgs in the sdss have been found to follow a steeper relation of radius to luminosity ( @xmath28 ) than the other e / s0s ( @xmath29 ) ; ( bernardi et al .",
    "2007 ; bernardi 2009 ) . in this paper",
    ", we look for systematic differences in their cmr and radial colour gradients with respect to other e / s0 galaxies , especially those in the same luminosity range ( @xmath1 to @xmath30 ) .",
    "some models , for example , predict a much flatter cmr for the bcgs , as a result of formation from a relatively large number of mergers of ( already ) old and red galaxies ( de lucia and blaizot 2007 ) .",
    "ko and i m ( 2005 ) found indications that the colour gradients of ellipticals in dense cluster environments tended to be less strong than in field environments , which again could be due to ( more ) mergers .    in section 2 of this paper",
    "we describe the data used and our selection of early - type galaxies and bcgs . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we investigate and compare their cmr and colour-@xmath9 relation . in section 5",
    "we use an estimator of colour gradient based on the ratio of @xmath4 and @xmath5-band effective radii to compare the colour gradients of bcgs and other e / s0s and examine the dependences on luminosity , radius , and density . in section 6 we look at the influence of stellar age , as estimated from the spectra .",
    "we conclude in section 7 with summary and further discussion .",
    "sdss magnitudes are given in the ab system where @xmath31 log @xmath32 ( in ergs @xmath33 ) ; equivalently , @xmath34 is 3631 jy . we assume throughout a spatially flat cosmology with @xmath35 km @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , giving the age of the universe as 13.88 gyr .",
    "we first describe the selection of e / s0 and bcg galaxies used in the colour - magnitude relation analysis . for the following analysis of colour gradients",
    ", we exclude some objects to give somewhat smaller samples , as described in section 5.1 .    in paper",
    "i we selected 70378 e and s0 galaxies out of a total of 367471 galaxies in the dr4 spectroscopic sample of the sloan digital sky survey , with parameters updated to dr6 .",
    "strict criteria were applied ; the e / s0s had to have de vaucouleurs profile fractions ( @xmath39 ) from the sdss disk - plus - bulge fits of 1.0 in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( i.e. galaxies with any significant disk component are excluded ) , ` eclass ' spectroscopic classification parameters @xmath40 ( signifying absorption - line spectra ) , and dereddened @xmath5-band model magnitudes @xmath41 .",
    "redshift range is @xmath42 .",
    "the same sample is used here , and ( as in paper i ) we include the small ` sky subtraction ' corrections from hyde and bernardi ( 2009 ) ; applied to the sdss photometry these have the effect of slightly increasing the effective radii and brightening the model magnitudes ( in all passbands ) for the galaxies of larger angular size .    here we make use of two samples of bcgs , both selected from the sdss .",
    "the first are the ` c4 bcgs ' , a subsample of the first - ranked galaxies within the catalog of clusters detected using a ` c4 ' cluster - detection algorithm on the sdss - dr2 data ( miller et al . 2005 ) .",
    "bernardi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) selected a subset of 286 ( of the original list of 748 ) bcgs as those with @xmath43 , velocity dispersion ( @xmath9 ) measurements and at least 10 other @xmath43 galaxies within 1.4 mpc .",
    "we further restrict the bernardi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) c4 sample to the 166 bcgs which lacked any spiral or disk component and had no neighbours close enough to confuse the radial profile .",
    "these cover the redshift range @xmath44 to 0.16315 with a mean @xmath45 .    for the c4 bcgs ( only )",
    "we have improved photometry available ; the galaxies were individually re - examined using software developed with ` matlab ' , which fitted new galmorph magnitudes and radii in a system equivalent to the sdss model magnitudes ( hyde and bernardi 2009 ) , with more accurate sky subtraction ( not requiring further corrections ) .    the second , larger sample of bcgs is selected from the ` max - bcg ' catalog of koester et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and previously studied by bernardi ( 2009 ) ; as in bernardi ( 2009 ) the selection criteria are to use only galaxies with sdss spectra and which have @xmath46 in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath47 km @xmath48 , a concentration index @xmath49 , and a dereddened model magnitude @xmath41 .",
    "this provides a sample of 4919 bcgs covering a deeper redshift range @xmath50 to 0.31722 with a mean @xmath51 . for the max - bcg galaxies we have only the standard dr6 photometry and effective radii , to which we applied the sky - subtraction corrections from hyde and bernardi ( 2009 ) .",
    "fourthly , we select a comparison sample of high luminosity non - bcg e / s0s . this is the subset of the 70378 e / s0 galaxies with absolute magnitudes @xmath1 ( there are 20110 ) after excluding all galaxies identified as bcgs i.e. members of either the c4 bcg or max - bcg lists , to give a non - bcg sample of 18225 .",
    "bernardi et al . ( 2003 and 2005 ) investigated the cmr of early - type galaxies in the sdss , deriving the rest - frame @xmath2 colours from the observer - frame photometry using k - corrections calculated from models and template spectra ( e.g. hogg 2002 ) . in roche , bernardi and hyde ( 2009 , hereafter paper i ) , we investigated the cmr of a larger sample of 70378 e / s0 galaxies from later sdss releases ( adelman and mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) , again in terms of the mean rest - frame @xmath2 colour as a function of red absolute magnitude ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this time , rather than using modelled k - corrections , we obtained rest - frame colours using the observed sdss spectra of the individual galaxies ( independently of any models ) , using two methods described briefly below ( see paper i for more details ) .",
    "firstly , we extracted rest - frame @xmath4 and @xmath5 magnitudes directly from the spectra by integrating directly over the relevant wavelength ranges .",
    "we term these spectra - derived colours .",
    "this method does not use the imaging data at all or require any k - correction .",
    "however , the spectra - derived colour only measures @xmath2 in the central 3 arcsec diameter aperture covered by the spectrograph fibre . as the angular size of an sdss galaxy may be much larger than this , and will be correlated with luminosity , this can introduce a bias into the cmr ( e.g. changing its slope ) if the galaxies have radial colour gradients .",
    "the second method was to integrate the spectra over the observed and rest - frame passbands ; the difference of these two magnitudes provided a spectra - derived k - correction for each individual galaxy .",
    "the sdss imaging photometry provides magnitudes based on profile fits to the galaxies ( in the case of these galaxies , de vaucouleurs profiles ) , with the effective radius fixed across all passbands to that @xmath53 measured by fitting in the @xmath5-band .",
    "these are termed ` model ' magnitudes and colours .",
    "subtracting the spectra - derived k - corrections from the model magnitudes will then give rest - frame colours for the integrated emission from the whole of each galaxy .",
    "however , the model magnitude colours can also be subject to biases - in the opposite direction - because a k - correction based on an fixed - aperture spectrum is being applied to a colour derived from a model fit , which may be from a much larger aperture .    in agreement with previous studies , we found approximately linear cmrs , redder @xmath2 colours for the more luminous galaxies , and a mild blueward shift of the cmr with increasing redshift .",
    "however , our cmr based on spectra - derived colours was steeper than the cmr from model - magnitude colours ( @xmath54 compared to -0.018 ) , and showed more evolution with redshift .",
    "similar variation in the cmr slopes between aperture and ` total ' photometric systems had been reported on by scordeggio ( 2001 ) and bernardi et al .",
    "the colour differences @xmath55 and @xmath56 will be sensitive to radial colour gradients .",
    "in paper i we also examined the relation of colour to internal stellar velocity dispersion @xmath9 , the @xmath57 . as expected , galaxies with greater @xmath9 were redder , but we did not see a difference in slope between the spectra - derived and model - magnitude based @xmath57 ; both gave @xmath58 .",
    "this suggested that colour gradients might depend differently on luminosity and on @xmath9 , and might have a positive correlation only with luminosity .",
    "we found that the difference between the 3-arcsec aperture and model magnitude colours was correlated with the residual of @xmath9 relative to the mean @xmath9@xmath52 relation , and similarly with the @xmath52 residual to the @xmath52@xmath9 relation .",
    "these two correlations indicated a stronger ( negative ) colour gradient was associated with a higher luminosity and/or a lower @xmath9 relative to the mean @xmath59 .",
    "we investigate this further in section 5.2 below , after again looking at cmrs .    in this paper",
    "we again make use of rest - frame @xmath2 colours and absolute magnitudes @xmath52 obtained from the sdss model magnitudes ( or the galmorph magnitudes in the case of the c4 bcgs ) , corrected to rest - frame using the spectra - derived k - corrections calculated as described in paper i ( including the ` signal / noise ' correction , which had the effect of reducing the @xmath4-band k - correction by a few hundredths of a magnitude for the fainter objects , on the basis of an apparent discrepancy between the spectral calibration and the imaging photometry ) .",
    "we also make use of the rest - frame colours derived directly from the spectra .",
    "figure 1 shows the cmr , in model - magnitude @xmath2 colours k - corrected to rest - frame and averaged in @xmath60 intervals , for the full e / s0 sample of paper i ( divided into 7 redshift intervals ) , the c4 bcgs and the max - bcgs . as in paper",
    "i the absolute magnitudes are ` de - evolved ' by adding @xmath61 magnitudes to separate the colour evolution from the effect of luminosity evolution .",
    "the c4 and max - bcg galaxies have similar cmrs , with the lower redshift c4s being slightly ( @xmath3 mag ) redder",
    ". both sets of bcgs are on average slightly redder than the e / s0s at a similar luminosity and redshift and their cmrs are also flatter in slope .    as in paper",
    ", i we fit the galaxy cmrs with the form @xmath62 with separate linear dependencies on @xmath52 ( @xmath63 , the slope ) and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , the evolution ) and no cross - term .",
    "the first line of table 1 gives the fitted parameters for the ( model - magnitudes ) cmr of our full e / s0 sample ; these are the same as given in paper i.    figure 2 compares the cmrs of the max - bcg and the @xmath1 non - bcg galaxies , divided into two intervals of redshift , and the c4 bcgs ( in a single redshift interval  all are at @xmath66 ) ; this is shown for both model - magnitude and spectra - derived colours .",
    "the two bcg samples have quite similar cmrs . in model magnitudes ,",
    "the non - bcg cmr is significantly bluer than that of either bcg sample ( in each redshift interval ) , except perhaps at the highest luminosities , and appears steeper in slope . in spectra - derived magnitudes ,",
    "all the cmrs are moved slightly redwards ( this could be the effect of negative colour gradients ) , but there is much less colour difference in between the bcgs and non - bcgs    table 1 gives the parameters fitted to these cmrs ( an evolution term is only fitted for the max - bcg sample of bcgs as the c4 sample is too small and covers a narrow redshift range ) .",
    "these indicate that the cmr of ( both sets of ) bcgs , although not entirely flat , has a slope ( @xmath63 ) less than half that of the non - bcg e / s0s of similar luminosity .",
    "this difference in @xmath63 is seen for both model and spectra - derived colours . in model magnitudes",
    "we see little or no colour evolution ( @xmath65 ) , but in spectra - derived magnitudes there is ( as noted in paper i ) some blueward evolution with redshift .",
    "this colour evolution is seen here for both bcgs and non - bcgs , with marginal evidence of a slightly lower rate for the bcgs .",
    "the mean residual of the max - bcg @xmath2 , relative to to the @xmath67 fitted to the non - bcg @xmath1 e / s0s , is @xmath68 in model magnitudes and @xmath69 in spectra - derived magnitude . for the smaller c4 sample these @xmath70",
    "are @xmath71 and @xmath72 magnitudes .",
    "thus the bcgs are significantly redder than other e / s0 ( matched in luminosity ) in their mean model - fit colours but with much less or no difference in their spectra - derived ( i.e. central 3 arcsec aperture ) colours .",
    ".fits to colour - magnitude relations [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we can make the same comparison for the relation of colour to internal stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath9 ) , hereafter the c@xmath9r . as described in paper i",
    ", we apply small corrections to the sdss @xmath9 measurements to convert from the spectrograph aperture to a physical scale of @xmath73 , assuming the @xmath74 of jrgensen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the colour-@xmath9 relation ( c@xmath9r ) , defined in model magnitude rest - frame @xmath2 , for the full e / s0 sample and the two bcg samples . as in the cmr",
    ", we see the bcgs tend to be slightly redder ( at a given @xmath9 ) and have a flatter c@xmath9r .",
    "we fit with @xmath75 the first line of table 2 gives the fitted parameters for the whole e / s0 sample ( as given in paper i ) .",
    "figure 4 compares the c@xmath9r of the two bcg samples with the non - bcg @xmath1 galaxies , computed for both model and spectra - derived magnitudes .",
    "table 2 gives the fitted parameters ( again , evolution is not fitted for the small c4 sample ) .",
    "again the bcg @xmath76 slope is less than half that of the non - bcg e / s0s . as we saw for the cmr ,",
    "the spectra - derived colours show more blueward evolution than the model - magnitude colours , with the bcgs having a slightly lower evolution rate .",
    "in the c@xmath9r the mean colour residual of the max - bcgs relative to the non - bcg @xmath77 is @xmath78 mag in model - magnitude @xmath2 and @xmath69 mag in spectra - derived colour , and for the c4 sample these residuals are @xmath79 and @xmath80 mag ; very similar to the colour offsets in the cmr .",
    "as a simple and rapidly computable quantifier of radial colour gradient , we make use of the ratio of the de vaucouleurs effective radii fitted in the @xmath4 band and the @xmath5 band",
    ". this ratio will be unity for a galaxy with no colour gradient and @xmath81 for a negative colour gradient , i.e. with the centre redder than the outer annuli .",
    "a ratio of de vaucouleurs @xmath53 ( in @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) was previously used as a colour gradient measure by ko and i m ( 2005 ) .    to be redshift - independent , we need to use @xmath84 and @xmath85 as they would be measured in the the rest - frame .",
    "we estimate these by linear interpolation between the @xmath86 fitted in the four passbands @xmath87 , using in the interpolation the passband mean wavelengths 4680 , 6180 , 7500 , 8870@xmath88 .",
    "we adopt a colour gradient measure as the restframe - corrected @xmath6 .",
    "this will be related to but not directly equivalent to @xmath89 , a measure of colour gradient obtained by directly fitting to the colour profiles of each galaxy .",
    "the relation between the two measures will depend on the exact form of the intensity profile and its variation with wavelength , and this may vary between individual ellipticals . to estimate this relation for the sdss sample and to verify whether @xmath6 is a valid measure of colour gradient across this range of galaxies",
    ", we obtain from the sdss data release 7 the tabulated @xmath4 and @xmath5 profiles for a small sample ( 90 galaxies ) .    for the 90 galaxies , which include 21 bcgs , we make a linear error - weighted fit of the form @xmath90 to the @xmath2 colour profile over all annular bins from an inner radius 0.67 arcsec to the outer limit of the tabulated profile , usually 28 arcsec , examining each fit by eye .",
    "figure 5 shows the gradient @xmath89 plotted against our colour gradient @xmath6 .",
    "it is clearly correlated with a linear correlation coefficient 0.768 and best fit relation @xmath91 , passing very close to the origin as expected , but the scatter of 0.122 is rather large .",
    "this is in part because a significant minority of the ellipticals have colour profiles not linear in log radius ; we see non - monotonic gradients for about @xmath92 and in these cases , the @xmath53 ratio tends to be sensitive to the colour profile at a larger radius than the direct fit ( which is weighted towards smaller radii where the error bars are smaller ) .    despite this ,",
    "bcgs and high and low luminosity e / s0s , considered separately ( figure 6 ) , show similar relations between the two colour gradient measures .",
    "however , the relation is much tighter for the bcgs with a scatter of only 0.053 , compared to 0.123 ( high l e / s0 ) and 0.150 ( low l e / s0 ) . as a further test , we examine ( figure 7 ) the residuals of the @xmath89 to the best - fit linear relation , as a function of @xmath52 and apparent @xmath53 ( in the @xmath5-band ) ; a significant trend could introduce a bias into the investigations of this paper .",
    "we find the scatter tends to increase at lower luminosity but there is not an obvious systematic trend .",
    "neither do we see a trend with apparent radius , down to about 1.8 arcsec . however , for galaxies smaller than this radius the scatter increases greatly and asymmetrically , which is probably unacceptable for our purposes . for galaxies with @xmath93 arcsec it may not be possible to meaningfully characterize the colour gradient at all using sdss data . for early - type galaxies of",
    "larger apparent size , including the bcgs , the ratio of de vaucoleurs radii does appear to be a valid , consistent and approximately linear colour gradient measure .",
    "returning to figure 5 , if all @xmath93 arcsec galaxies are excluded , leaving 51 , the best - fit linear relation changes only slightly to @xmath94 , but the scatter is decreased by more than a factor of two to a much more acceptable 0.056 ( similar to the scatter for bcgs only ) , and the correlation coefficient is increased to 0.862 .",
    "some galaxies in our sample have very strong ( @xmath95 ) or inverted ( @xmath40 ) colour gradients ( i.e. @xmath96 ) . examining some of these , we find that some are galaxies confused with or very close to ( red or blue ) stars , and that there are also some misclassified spirals present , despite our strict selection criterion of @xmath97 in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "to reduce any biases that these types of objects may introduce , we exclude some galaxies from the colour gradient analysis .",
    "firstly , we excluded the objects with gradients ( i.e. @xmath98 ) calculated as @xmath99 or @xmath81 , far out of the normal range ( there were only 130/70378 ) .",
    "secondly , we examined by eye all galaxies in the e / s0 sample with gradients 0.41.0 ; these numbered 1869 out of 70378 .",
    "it was estimated that 108 of these were elliptical - elliptical mergers , 26 were mergers involving spirals , 98 were barred spirals , 142 were edge - on disks , 120 were other galaxies with visible spiral arms and 88 were confused with stars . all of these except the elliptical mergers , 474 galaxies , were marked for exclusion .",
    "it should also be noted that many other high colour gradient galaxies were asymmetric or disturbed .    at lower colour gradients the proportion of face - on spirals decreases steeply ( @xmath100 at gradient @xmath101 , @xmath102 at 0.3 , @xmath103 at 0.2 ) but less steeply for edge - on disks ( @xmath104 at gradient @xmath101 , @xmath104 at 0.3 , @xmath105 at 0.2 ) .",
    "however , the latter could easily be removed as they had axis ratios ( from the @xmath5-band de vaucouleurs fits ) of typically @xmath106 and always @xmath107 , whereas virtually all ellipticals had @xmath108 .",
    "we therefore exclude all galaxies with @xmath107 , whatever their colour gradient .",
    "lastly , because of their very large scatter on figure 7 , we exclude all objects with @xmath5-band @xmath53 smaller than 1.8 arcsec .    these exclusion criteria , for the purposes of colour gradient analysis , reduce the all e / s0 sample to 37001 , the @xmath109 non - bcg sample to 13652 , and the max - bcg sample to 4485 ( we note that these exclusions make very little difference to the colour - magnitude relations of the respective samples , the main effect being increased error bars at the lowest luminosities ) .      after this filtering , for the whole e / s0 sample the mean",
    "@xmath6 is @xmath110 with a scatter 0.11724 . from the relation on figure 6 this corresponds to @xmath111 and",
    "so lies half - way between the mean gradient @xmath112 measured for similarly selected e / s0s by la barbera and carvalho ( 2009 ) and the larger @xmath113 found by suh et al .",

    "gradient is similar , @xmath114 with a scatter 0.11414 .",
    "but for the max - bcgs the mean gradient is significantly lower at @xmath115 with scatter 0.07645 .",
    "hence , we find evidence that bcgs have flatter colour gradients than other e / s0s ; the difference is modest but with this large sample highly significant - the bcgs mean gradient is @xmath116 less than for the @xmath1 non - bcgs and @xmath117 less than for all e / s0 .",
    "figure 8 shows the mean @xmath6 as a function of absolute magnitude @xmath52 .",

    "this reflects the finding in paper i that a low @xmath9 relative to luminosity is associated with a strong colour gradient .",

    "the turnover at large radii is produced by @xmath128 galaxies , in which colour gradient is ` suppressed ' and the correlation with radius is flattened .",

    "we express this in the form log ( @xmath130 ) for @xmath9 in km @xmath48 and @xmath131 in kpc . in these units",
    "the mean density for the e / s0s is 3.38 with a scatter 0.42 .",
    "this can also be converted to units of solar masses @xmath132 . from boylan - kolchin ,",

    "is seen over a very wide luminosity range , and strongest at @xmath141 .",
    "to briefly summarize at this point , we find colour gradients in e / s0s to ( i ) be greatest at intermediate luminosities and ( ii ) at a fixed luminosity to be anticorrelated with velocity dispersion and mass density , and that ( iii ) colour gradients tend to be flatter in bcgs and to show much less dependence on galaxy properties .",
    "we now investigate the effects of age .",
    "for most galaxies in the e / s0 sample ( 64774/70378 ) and the @xmath1 non - bcg sample ( 16337/18225 ) , we have mean stellar age ( ` age50 ' ) estimated from the spectral index analysis of gallazzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) performed on the @xmath142 galaxies of the dr4 .",
    "this catalog includes only part of the max - bcg list . by position - matching the two lists we find there are stellar age estimates for almost half ( 2274/4919 ) the max - bcg sample , sufficient to investigate age - dependent effects .",
    "these stellar ages will generally be less than the lookback time to galaxy formation , and as they are luminosity - weighted , the age estimate of a galaxy may be greatly reduced if it has experienced recent episodes of star - formation .    the stellar mean age ( and scatter )",
    "are 6.92 ( 1.74 ) gyr for all e / s0s , 7.04 ( 1.69 ) gyr for the non - bcgs , 7.54 ( 1.39 ) gyr for the max - bcgs and 8.12 ( 1.33 ) gyr for the c4 bcgs . the greater mean age of the c4 bcgs is due to these being a lower redshift sample than the others .",
    "figure 16a shows the age distributions for the 3 deep samples ; the modal ages are similar but there are fewer younger ( @xmath143 gyr ) and more older ages ( 910 gyr ) ages amongst the bcgs .",
    "we add the mean stellar ages to the lookback times at the redshifts of observation , giving lookback times to the mean stellar formation time , and then convert these back to ` formation ' redshifts ( not the redshift of galaxy formation but the mean redshift of luminosity - weighted star formation , which will be lower ) for the galaxies .",
    "figure 16b shows the distribution of the mean redshift of star formation ; there is more of a difference here between the all - e / s0 sample and the bcgs and other high luminosity galaxies , as the more luminous galaxies tend to be observed at higher redshifts as well as being older .",
    "the mean star - formation redshift is 1.32 for all e / s0 , 1.56 for the non - bcgs , 1.53 gyr for the c4 bcgs and 1.82 for the max - bcgs ; mean lookback times are 8.47 , 9.17 , 9.22 and 9.85 gyr .",
    "figure 17 shows mean age against @xmath52 ; the bcgs are not only older than other e / s0s but show less of an increase in age with luminosity .",
    "we investigate whether the redder colours and weaker colour gradients of bcgs are related to their greater ages , and in addition , whether the trends in ( non - bcg ) colour gradients with galaxy properties are caused by age effects . a higher luminosity or lower @xmath9 relative to the mean @xmath144 relation , found ( in paper i and here ) to be associated with a stronger colour gradient ,",
    "is also correlated with a younger stellar age ( forbes and ponman 1999 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2005 ; gallazzi et al .",
    "2006 ) .    on figure 18 , for non - bcg e",
    "/ s0s the colour gradients are maximum at stellar ages 45 gyr and decrease by almost a factor of two to the highest ages . on figure 19",
    "it can be seen that this peak in gradient vs. age is most pronounced for galaxies of intermediate luminosities of @xmath141 , weaker at both @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and apparently absent at @xmath147 and @xmath148 , following a rather symmetric luminosity trend .",
    "the bcg colour gradients show no age dependence ( at @xmath149 gyr ) , and again the bcgs have lower colour gradients than the non - bcg e / s0 sample , at all but the highest ages where the two converge .",
    "a potential problem with this analysis is that the stellar ages are ` central ' ages estimated from the spectra in fixed apertures , and if colour gradients were typically driven by age gradients this would bias the age - gradient relation .",
    "we are not able to investigate age gradients with the single aperture of sdss spectroscopy , but tamura and ohta ( 2004 ) and la barbera and carvalho ( 2009 ) find that age gradients in early - types are typically very small or consistent with zero and the negative colour gradient is essentially a metallicity gradient ( positive colour gradients can be stellar age related , as discussed below , but these occur in @xmath150 of these samples ) .    at ages of @xmath151 gyr",
    "there is sharp drop in mean colour gradient in the youngward direction , seemingly for all luminosities of e / s0 and even the bcgs ( although very few - @xmath152 - of this bcg sample are this young ) .",
    "this can be explained by the younger stellar populations within these galaxies being more centrally concentrated , giving positive age gradients which counteract negative metallicity gradients to flatten the colour gradients .",
    "some post - starburst galaxies have significantly opposite gradients i.e. blue cores ( yamauchi and goto 2005 ) from central populations of very young stars ( suh et al . 2010 ) .",
    "we examined the images and spectra of some of the galaxies with very inverted colour gradients .",
    "although some of the most extreme examples were galaxies confused with stellar images , out of 40 galaxies with gradient @xmath153 and age @xmath154 gyr , most looked like normal ellipticals and many had strong balmer absorption lines indicative of post - starburst galaxies .",
    "the best 7 examples had equivalent widths of 5@xmath155 for both @xmath13 and @xmath156 absorption ( these are j034453.17 - 065442.9 , j150020.11 + 040000.2 , j211348.16 - 063059.6 , j210258.87 + 103300.6 , j225226.07 + 150303.1 , j130029.44 + 545503.9 and j155435.53 + 291319.9 ) ; there were a further 6 with @xmath13 @xmath157@xmath158 , and two more with less absorption in @xmath13 but @xmath156 @xmath159 .    figures 18 and 19 show that differences in the colour gradient properties of bcgs and non - bcgs are still apparent when they are age - matched , and so are not simply caused by the difference in their mean age . in the same way we can investigate whether this is the case for their colours .",
    "figure 20a shows mean model @xmath2 against stellar age ; the youngest galaxies are much bluer , but the age dependence flattens at @xmath160 gyr , while the bcgs are redder than age - matched non - bcgs .",
    "the @xmath1 non - bcgs are also redder than the full e / s0 sample , due to the higher metallicity of the more luminous galaxies ( hence these are the more appropriate sample to compare colours with the bcgs ) , but the bcgs are @xmath3 mag redder still .",
    "figure 20b shows how colour depends strongly on luminosity even when ages are matched ( hence the cmr slope is not just age driven ) .",
    "the spectra - derived colours ( figure 20c ) follow a more linear relation to stellar age with @xmath161 , and , notably , do not appear to differ between bcgs and age - matched , similarly luminous non - bcgs ( except for the few very young bcgs , which are redder ) .",
    "the difference between the model and spectra - derived ( aperture ) colours is caused by colour gradients .",
    "we found bcgs to be at least @xmath162 mag redder than other e / s0s in the model - magnitude cmr and c@xmath9r ( figures 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) with a smaller ( @xmath163 mag ) or no significant difference in the spectra - derived colours .",
    "this can now be explained as a combination of ( i ) the 0.5 gyr greater mean age of bcgs compared with luminosity - matched non - bcgs , corresponding to @xmath164 in the aperture colour , and ( ii ) the flatter colour gradients of bcgs , meaning that even if their spectra - derived ( central ) colours match those of non - bcgs , their model - magnitude colours will be redder .",
    "this could account for the remaining @xmath165 magnitudes .    to further investigate the relationship between age and colour gradient ,",
    "we show mean @xmath6 against radius ( figure 21 ) @xmath10 ( figure 22 ) and density ( figure 23 ) for the full e / s0 sample divided by mean stellar ` formation ' redshift .",
    "bcgs are included to see if their different properties with respect to other e / s0s resemble the effects of increased age .",
    "we also ( figure 24 ) plot colour gradient against dynamic mass , estimated as @xmath166 ; for units of km@xmath48 and kpc , @xmath167 .",
    "colour gradients show a broad peak at @xmath168 , which is more pronounced for galaxies with younger stellar ages .",
    "colour gradients in the galaxies with the youngest stellar populations , @xmath169 , show correlations with galaxy properties , similar to the @xmath170 galaxies , but offset downwards , as might result from the presence of an admixture of post - starbursts with negative gradients .",
    "colour gradients in e / s0s depend significantly on radius , density , mass etc .",
    "_ within _ each @xmath171 interval .",
    "however , these correlations , especially those with radius and density , become less strong in @xmath172 galaxies .",
    "we discuss this further in the next section .",
    "\\(i ) the colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) and colour - velocity dispersion relation ( c@xmath9r ) of bcgs are significantly flatter in slope(@xmath173 and @xmath174 ) than the respective relations for non - bcg e / s0 galaxies of comparable ( high ) luminosity .",
    "the difference in slope is about a factor of two , whether we define the @xmath2 colour using k - corrected model magnitudes or rest - frame magnitudes derived from integrating the sdss spectra .",
    "bcgs are also , on average , @xmath3 mag redder in model magnitudes ( k - corrected to rest - frame ) than e / s0s of the same @xmath52 or @xmath9 , but with less or no offset in spectra - derived colours .",
    "the hierarchical merging model of lucia and blaizot ( 2007 ) predicts a flat cmr for bcgs as a result of late assembly from a large number of red progenitors which formed their stars very much earlier ( @xmath175 ) . this model included a very early truncation of star - formation .",
    "skelton , bell and somerville ( 2009 ) present a simplified model in which dry mergers of already merged e / s0s on a ` creation red sequence ' mildly flatten the cmr slope at higher luminosities .",
    "there may indeed be some flattening in the bright end of the cmr for all e / s0s ( see paper i ) , but for bcgs we find much more , although the bcg cmr is not entirely flat .",
    "this suggests the bcgs or their progenitors evolve by a less extreme scenario than the first of these models but perhaps with a higher dry merger rate compared to the e / s0s in the second model .",
    "in addition to being flattened , the bcg cmr is offset redwards .",
    "\\(ii ) as a simple quantifier of radial colour gradient we use @xmath6 , with the effective radii @xmath84 and @xmath85 , corrected to the rest - frame by linearly interpolating between the radii fitted in the bands @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath176 and @xmath64 .",
    "we show that at least for galaxies with angular @xmath53 radii above 1.8 arcsec , this ratio is well and linearly correlated to @xmath177 across the observed range of colour gradients and galaxy luminosities , and estimate @xmath178 . the large scatter in this correlation , which we initially estimated as 0.122 ,",
    "is reduced to a much more acceptable 0.056 if only galaxies with @xmath53",
    "larger than 1.8 arcsec are included .    after excluding the @xmath93 arcsec galaxies and a few others which we believed to be spiral types , we found for the e / s0s a mean colour gradient , using our measure , of @xmath110 with a comparable galaxy - to galaxy scatter 0.1172 . for the @xmath1 non - bcg",
    "the mean is similar at @xmath114 ( scatter 0.1141 ) and for max - bcgs the mean is @xmath115 ( scatter 0.0764 ) .",
    "therefore we find at high significance that bcgs have a flatter ( by an average of @xmath7 ) radial colour gradient than other high luminosity spheroidals .",
    "this again could be due to intensified merging in the cluster - core environment .",
    "la barbera et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and similarly ko and i m ( 2005 ) , reported mean colour gradients in e / s0s of all luminosities were weaker by almost a factor two in the richest clusters ( @xmath179 ) compared to the field , and suggested this was because formation histories in denser cluster environments included more elliptical - elliptical mergers ( e.g. tran et al .",
    "2005 ) , which reduce colour / metallicity gradients ( kobayashi 2004 ) .    the simulations of boylan - kolchin , ma and quataert ( 2006 ) account for the steeper @xmath180@xmath181 of bcgs , i.e. their ` abnormally ' large sizes ( e.g. bernardi 2009 ) , as the result of repeated ` dry ' ( dissipationless , non - star - forming ) mergers , and especially of the anisotropic accretion of smaller spheroidals in near - radial , low angular momentum orbits , which might occur preferentially in a cluster core .",

    "colour gradients tend to decrease with increasing velocity dispersion @xmath9 , by almost 1/2 between 150 and 300 km @xmath48 , confirming the suggestion in our paper i that the trends with @xmath52 and @xmath9 are different .",
    "\\(iv ) colour gradients in e / s0s show strong correlations with some other galaxy properties .",
    "colour gradients increase , by about a factor of two , with from small to larger effective radius , up to a maximum at 8 - 12 kpc ( depending on luminosity ) .",
    "a positive correlation with radius was prevously reported by tamura and ohta ( 2003 ) for a small sample of e / s0s in abell 2199 . at even larger radii",
    "we find the mean colour gradients decrease , but this is actually because of a reduced gradient in the most luminous ( @xmath128 ) galaxies .",
    "if e / s0s are divided by luminosity , within low / moderate luminosity intervals there is simply a steep increase in colour gradient with @xmath131 .",
    "we find colour gradients to be negatively correlated with @xmath184 ( the @xmath9 residual relative to @xmath185 ) and mass density ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "of course , these quantities are related  a high density implies a high @xmath9 at a given dynamic mass ( rather than luminosity ) .",
    "these negative correlations do not seem to be caused by a selection effect ( from the flux limit of the sample ) , as they are seen within a wide range of narrow luminosity intervals , being strongest for e / s0s of moderate / high luminosity @xmath186 .",
    "\\(v ) we also examine the trend in colour gradient with the ` mean stellar ages ' estimated ( gallazzi et al . 2005 , 2006 ) for most of these galaxies using 5 indices from the sdss spectra . in non - bcg e / s0s the colour gradients are strongest for relatively young ages of 45 gyr ( which may signify the presence of younger stellar populations or more extended star - formation , rather than the galaxies being younger ) and decrease by up to a factor of two to the oldest ages of 11 gyr",
    ". this may be primarily because older stellar populations have experienced more mergers and interactions , especially at high redshifts .",
    "early - type galaxies which ceased forming stars and joined the red sequence more recently ( e.g. post - mergers of spirals at @xmath187 ) would tend to have stronger colour gradients , if it is dry mergers ( occurring after the end of star - formation ) that flatten the gradients .    however , there is a drop in mean colour gradient for the galaxies with mean stellar ages less than 34 gyr ( even in bcgs ) .",
    "this is likely due to the inclusion of post - starburst galaxies , which can have blue cores giving inverted ( positive ) colour gradients ( friaca and terlevich 1999 ; yamauchi and goto 2005 ) together with young age indicators like strong balmer absorption lines . to confirm this we examined the spectra of 40 galaxies with age @xmath154 gyr and inverted colour gradients ( @xmath153 ) and found many with enhanced balmer absorption including 7 with equivalent widths @xmath188 in both @xmath13 and @xmath156 .",
    "suh et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that blue - cored early - types in general had at least mildly enhanced @xmath13 absorption , and showed that the balmer enhancement and the positive colour gradients could both be accounted for by centrally concentrated , very young stellar populations ( age @xmath189 ) , comprising only @xmath190@xmath103 of the stellar mass .",
    "\\(vi ) colour gradients in bcgs are consistently lower than in non - bcg spheroidals of the same luminosity , velocity dispersion or radius .",
    "some classes of non - bcg ellipticals , those with ( i ) the highest luminosities and largest radii , ( ii ) the highest @xmath9 relative to @xmath52 , or ( iii ) the highest densities , also have mean colour gradients of @xmath191 .",
    "but within the bcg class mean @xmath98 remains at @xmath11 , almost regardless of the other galaxy properties .",
    "the mean colour gradient in bcgs decreases a little for the largest radii and with increasing dynamic mass , but is uncorrelated with mass density , the @xmath10 residual , or stellar age ( except for the drop at @xmath154 gyr ) .",
    "the process of colour gradient flattening through dry mergers appears to have operated most strongly on ( all ) bcgs , reducing the mean colour gradients to @xmath11 , but never much lower than this , whatever the initial value . in the di matteo",
    "( 2009 ) model of dry mergers , a galaxy with a strong colour gradient will probably merge with one of lower gradient and experience a significant flattening , but a galaxy with already a very flat colour gradient would probably merge with one with higher gradient and experience no further decrease or even a slight increase . with repeated mergers",
    "this would cause an exponential decrease in the mean gradient and also a narrowed distribution , which is what we seem to find for the merged classes of galaxies , with mean gradients of @xmath129 consistently .",
    "we found the bcgs had @xmath192 less galaxy - to - galaxy variation in colour gradient than the e / s0s ( this difference might be even greater after taking measurement errors into account ) .",
    "in addition , the radial mergers thought to occur in bcgs would strongly increase their radii ( and reduce density ) while simultanously flattening colour gradients , thus erasing the gradient - radius correlation ( and gradient - density anticorrelation ) seen in other spheroidals .",
    "\\(vii ) we examine colour as a function of stellar age , comparing the bcgs and other e / s0s .",
    "the bcgs are on average 0.5 gyr older at observation than the @xmath1 non - bcgs , and their mean lookback time to formation is estimated as 0.68 gyr greater .",
    "this could simply reflect the correlation of earlier formation ( by as much as @xmath193 gyr ) with high - density cluster environment ( e.g. sheth et al .",
    "2006 ; rogers et al .",
    "the bcgs also have a flatter age - luminosity relation , as might be expected if bcgs ( of all masses ) form from dry major mergers of red early - type galaxies ( with older ages associated with the cluster - core environment ) , which would increase luminosity without changing the mean stellar age . in the same way",
    ", their cmr is flattened .",
    "if , on the other hand , the bcgs had formed ` monolithically ' , without major merging , they might show stronger trends in their stellar populations ( age , composition ) with luminosity / mass , extrapolating the trends seen in less massive e / s0s .    in rest - frame model - magnitude @xmath2 ,",
    "bcgs are slightly redder than non - bcg e / s0s of the same age , whereas in spectra - derived @xmath2 , they lie on the same ( approximately linear ) relation of colour to age .",
    "we conclude that the ( @xmath194 mag ) redder model - magnitude @xmath2 colours of the bcgs in the cmr and c@xmath9r can be explained simply by their greater mean ages combined with their flatter colour gradients , which would give them a slightly redder model - magnitude colour for a given central - aperture ( e.g. spectra - derived ) colour .",
    "\\(viii ) we re - examine the correlations of colour gradient with galaxy properties , dividing by age ( star - formation redshift ) .",
    "the positive correlation of colour gradient with radius , and the anticorrelation with density and @xmath195 are strongest in younger galaxies but are seen within all age intervals . with increasing age ,",
    "these correlations flatten somewhat while the mean colour gradients decrease , as might be expected for sequential dry mergers in the di matteo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) model .",
    "the decrease in colour gradient with the @xmath9 residual @xmath10 is not solely due to the known correlation of this quantity with stellar age ( forbes and ponman 1999 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2005 ; gallazzi et al .",
    "2006 ) , as it is seen within each age interval .",
    "rather , it seems the colour gradient must have independent anticorrelations with the @xmath9 to luminosity ratio and with stellar age .",
    "it seems the process of spheroid formation sets up a metallicity / colour gradient , with a steepness positively correlated with the mass / luminosity of stars and also with a large radius and low mass density for the galaxy .",
    "subsequent mergers flatten the stronger gradients while adding low - gradient galaxies at the high - luminosity end of the e / s0 luminosity function .",
    "as dry mergers tend to increase size this also weakens the gradient - density relation ( figure 23 ) . a comparison with colour gradients in much higher redshift e / s0s would help to confirm this .",
    "the mean colour gradient in e / s0s decreases somewhat at @xmath196 because most of these higher - mass galaxies are the products of elliptical - elliptical ( dry ) mergers ( tran et al .",
    "2005 ; naab , khochfar and burkert 2006 ) .",
