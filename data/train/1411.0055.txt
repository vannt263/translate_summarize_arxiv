    "in @xcite , kathryn lindsey gives an elegant construction to show that any jordan curve in the complex plane can be approximated in the hausdorff topology by julia sets of polynomials ( another such construction was given subsequently by oleg ivrii @xcite ) , and further , that any finite collection of disjoint jordan domains can be approximated by the basins of attraction of a rational map .",
    "the proof depends on an interpolation result due to curtiss @xcite .    in this note",
    ", we give a direct geometric ( and computation - free ) proof that any closed subset of the riemann sphere can be approximated in the hausdorff topology by the julia set of a rational map .",
    "in the theory of electomagnetism , a _ dipole _ refers to a pair of oppositely charged particles with charges of equal magnitude .",
    "the electric field of a dipole falls off at a rate of @xmath0 because of the approximate cancellation of the fields at distances large compared to the separation of the particles ( unlike the usual inverse square law for a system with nonzero net charge ) .",
    "the point is that the dipole is effectively electrically neutral on large scales .    by analogy",
    ", we define a _ dipole _ to be a degree 1 rational function @xmath1 with a zero and pole at distinct non - zero @xmath2 , @xmath3 , for which @xmath4 is `` small '' .",
    "the dipole is uniformly close to 1 outside a small disk containing @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we now explain how to use dipoles to build designer julia sets .",
    "let s suppose we want to build a rational function whose julia set approximates @xmath5 , a closed subset of the riemann sphere . for simplicity ,",
    "suppose @xmath5 is disjoint from the unit circle .    first , start with the map @xmath6 where @xmath7 is some fixed big integer . the julia set of @xmath8 is the unit circle , and @xmath8 has @xmath9 and @xmath10 as superattracting fixed points .",
    "second , pick some finite collection @xmath11 of discrete points ( `` pixels '' ) which approximates @xmath5 closely in the hausdorff sense .",
    "we build a new rational function @xmath12 which is the product of @xmath8 with a dipole centered at each point in @xmath11 , where for each dipole the zero and pole are within distance @xmath13 of each other . as @xmath14 ,",
    "the julia sets of @xmath12 converge uniformly in the hausdorff topology to @xmath15 , which is equal to the union of @xmath11 together with its @xmath16th roots ( i.e. its preimages under @xmath8 ) , together with the unit circle . to see this , observe that the dynamics of @xmath12 converge uniformly to @xmath8 on compact subsets of the complement of this set , while the presence of the dipole near each point @xmath17 guarantees a point in the julia set of @xmath12 near @xmath17 , and near its preimages under @xmath8 . if @xmath7 is very big , @xmath15 is very close in the hausdorff topology to @xmath18 .",
    "but now we are basically done : in place of @xmath6 we could use a map @xmath19 whose julia set is an arbitrarily small circle centered at an arbitrary point @xmath20 ( for instance , a point in @xmath5 ) . repeating the construction above ,",
    "we get rational maps with julia sets as close as we like in the hausdorff sense to @xmath21 for @xmath11 an arbitrary finite set and @xmath20 arbitrary .",
    "figure  [ pixie ] shows an example of a sequence of julia sets constructed by this method .     for @xmath22 .",
    "the convergence of the julia sets to @xmath15 is evident .",
