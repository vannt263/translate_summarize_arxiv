    "the puzzle arises from the fact that braiding the end states in a diii class 1d superconductor always exchanges majorana kramers pairs rather than isolated majorana modes . while braiding two pairs of majoranas in chiral topological superconductors yields abelian operations , in this work , we show interestingly that braiding majorana end states in diii class topological superconductors is non - abelian due to the protection of time - reversal symmetry .",

    "it can be found that the coefficients @xmath103 are proportional to the overlapping integrals of the left- and right - end majorana wave functions , which decay exponentially with the distance @xmath6 between the majorana modes . since @xmath56 and @xmath57 are connected by @xmath104-transformation , their wave functions have exactly the same spatial profile , which leads to the same exponential form of the coefficients @xmath105 with @xmath62 the coherence length in the nanowire .",
    "the pre - factors @xmath106 depend on the local couplings , i.e. the hopping terms and pairings in @xmath84 , between electrons belonging to the same ( for @xmath107 ) or different ( for @xmath108 ) sectors of the time - reversal partners . for the realistic conditions , we consider that the chemical potential in the nanowire is far below the half - filling condition and thus the fermi momentum satisfying @xmath109 , and the coherence length ( in the order of @xmath101 m ) is typically much larger than the lattice constant @xmath110 ( @xmath111 nm ) . under these conditions we can verify that to @xmath103 the contributions of the spin - orbit coupling and @xmath2-wave pairing terms in @xmath84 vanish , and we find ( details can be found in the appendix section ) @xmath112 therefore while the magnitudes of @xmath103 can vary with @xmath6 and the bulk gap , their ratio @xmath113 is nearly a constant , and we always have @xmath114 , which validates the adiabatic condition .",

    "for other types of nanowires with smaller @xmath122-factors , the couplings are not harmful with even larger stray fields .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that in the above discussion we did not consider the quasiparticle poisoning which may change fermion parity and lead to decoherence of majorana qubit states . at low temperature ,",
    "the dominant effect in the quasiparticle poisoning comes from the single electron tunneling between the nanowire and the substrate superconductor  @xcite .",

    "the proximity induced gap in the similar parameter regime is expected to be larger compared with that in chiral nanowires , which suggests a longer decoherence time in the diii class majorana nanowires   @xcite .    to ensure that the decoherence effect induced by quasiparticle poisoning does not lead to serious problems ,",
    "one requires that the adiabatic manipulation time for majorana modes should be much less than the decoherence time . for the diii class majorana nanowires ,",

    "these estimates imply that the adiabatic manipulation of majorana modes may be reached in diii class 1d topological superconductors .",
    "note that braiding majorana end modes is not well - defined for a single 1d nanowire and , as first recognized by alicea et al .",
    ", the minimum setup for braiding requires a trijunction , e.g. a t - junction composed of two nanowire segments @xcite .",
    "the braiding can be performed by transporting the majorana zero modes following the steps as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ braiding](a - d ) .",
    "the fermion parity conservation for each sector shown above implies that the exchange of majorana end modes in diii class topological superconductor generically reduces to two independent processes of braiding majoranas of two different sectors , respectively .",

    "we show that after braiding the topological qubit states evolve according to ( see the supplementary material  @xcite ) @xmath134 we therefore obtain the braiding matrix by @xmath135 , which is time - reversal invariant .",

    "therefore the coupling between majorana fermions at the same end can only be induced by electron tunneling and the minimum requirement is to consider the second - order tunneling process . in the second - order perturbation",
    "@xmath175 and @xmath176 ( @xmath177 and @xmath178 ) couple to electron modes @xmath179 and @xmath180 in the right hand end ( @xmath181 and @xmath182 in the left hand end ) , respectively . when a nonzero @xmath5-wave pairing is present in the nanowires , the electrons @xmath183 and @xmath184 form a cooper pair and condense .",
    "this process leads to the effective coupling between majorana zero modes localized at the same end , with the coupling strength proportional to @xmath5-wave order parameter .",
    "finally , note that the system restores time - reversal symmetry at @xmath185 , which explains why the @xmath173-term is proportional to @xmath186 , and has @xmath171 periodicity .",
    "all these properties have been confirmed with numerical results .",
    "redefining the majorana bases by @xmath187 and @xmath188 , we recast the above hamiltonian into @xmath189 .",
    "the andreev bound state spectra are obtained straightforwardly by @xmath190 which is shown numerically in fig .",
    "[ josephson ] ( b - c ) . here",
    "@xmath191 are complex fermion number operators for @xmath192 and @xmath193 modes , respectively .",
    "the josephson currents are obtained by the slope of the andreev bound state spectra .",
    "in particular , we have that the josephson currents @xmath194 for the even parity states @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and @xmath195 for the odd parity states @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively [ fig .",
    "[ josephson](d ) ] .",
    "it is remarkable that the currents for odd parity states are of @xmath171 periodicity , half of those for even parity states [ fig .",
    "[ josephson](d ) ] .",
    "this reflects that @xmath196 is contributed from the direct majorana coupling induced by first - order single - electron tunneling  @xcite , while @xmath197 is a consequence of the second - order tunneling process which corresponds to the cooper pair tunneling .",
    "this nontrivial property is essentially different from the the josephson physics with multiple majorana end modes studied by d. sticlet et al . in the bdi class majorana chains",
    "@xcite , where a multi - copy version of the fractional josephson effect with @xmath170 periodicity is investigated .",
    "the reason is because in a bdi class topological superconductor the time - reversal symmetry operator @xmath198 and the different copies of the superconductor are not related by time - reversal symmetry ( nor by any other symmetry ) , while in the diii class topological superconductor the two copies are related by @xmath104-symmetry .",
    "the present result is also consistent with the fact that the time - reversal symmetry is restored with @xmath69 and @xmath70 forming kramers doublet at @xmath185 , which necessitates the @xmath171 periodicity in their spectra .",
    "furthermore , the two qubit states with the same total parity ( e.g. @xmath71 and @xmath199 ) are distinguished by the direction of the currents . the qualitative difference in the josephson currents",
    "imply that the four topological qubit states can be measured in the experiment .",
    "in summary , we have shown that majorana doublets obtained in the diii class 1d topological superconductors obey non - abelian statistics , due to the protection of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the key results are that the fermion parity is conserved for each copy of the @xmath0 tri topological superconductor , and the exchange of majorana end modes can generically reduce to two independent processes of braiding majoranas of two different copies , respectively .",
    "these results lead to the symmetry protected non - abelian statistics for the majorana doublets , and the braiding statistics are protected by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "furthermore , we unveiled an intriguing phenomenon in the josephson effect , that the periodicity of josephson currents depends on the fermion parity of the 1d tri topological superconductors .",
    "we found that this effect can provide direct measurements of the topological qubit states in the diii class majorana quantum wires .",
