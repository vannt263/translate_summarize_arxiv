    "opacity quantifies photon absorption in matter and plays a crucial role in many high energy density plasmas , including inertial fusion plasmas and stellar interiors@xcite .",
    "modeling opacities of ions with multiple bound electrons is very challenging and employs approximations that need to be experimentally validated@xcite .",
    "performing reliable opacity experiments is also challenging and must satisfy many criteria@xcite . measuring opacity becomes more difficult at higher temperature because the opacity sample has to be heated to the high temperature without significant gradients and has to be backlit by a bright radiation to minimize the effect of the hot sample plasma emission on the absorption measurement .",
    "the sandia national laboratories ( snl ) z machine ( z ) provides a unique platform to perform opacity experiments at temperatures above 150 ev@xcite .",
    "the z - pinch dynamic hohlraum ( zpdh ) is a terawatt x - ray radiation source at z that makes high - temperature opacity measurements possible@xcite .",
    "the opacity sample is located above the zpdh radiation source and is radiatively heated .",
    "most of the photons have energies above 600 ev .",
    "this powerful radiation streams through the sample and heats it without significant gradients@xcite .",
    "the zpdh also provides a bright backlighter to mitigate the sample self - emission .",
    "recently , we found that the opacity sample can reach higher temperatures and densities using the same radiation source only by changing the target configuration@xcite .",
    "however , it was not clear why the change in the target configuration affects the sample temperature if the sample is heated by the same radiation source . to further optimize this high temperature opacity experimental platform ,",
    "it is crucial to understand what dictates the sample temperature . in this article ,",
    "we provide experimental evidence that the source - to - sample distance depends on the sample configuration .",
    "this distance controls the source geometric dilution at the sample , thereby affecting the sample temperature .    with respect to the z - axis record the sample - transmitted backlighter images .",
    "due to the angle difference , the spectrometers at @xmath39@xmath5 see the backlighter centered at different locations on the sample ( i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "this parallax not only measures femg - attenuated and -unattenuated spectra simultaneously , but it also characterizes the backlighter relative location with respect to the `` half - moon '' boundary , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . ,",
    "the typical snl opacity experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the target consists of a semi - circular femg sample sandwiched by a circular tamping material ( e.g. , plastic , ch ) , which we call a half - moon target .",

    "each spectrometer has 4 - 6 slits , each 50 @xmath14 in width , at the halfway distance to the sample to provide spatial resolution of @xmath150.1 mm along the aperture direction with a magnification of @xmath151 .",
    "the transmitted backlighter images are recorded on kodak 2492 x - ray films with spatial and spectral resolution .    due to the finite source - to - sample distance , @xmath8 , the spectrometer at @xmath16 observes the backlighter bright spot through the femg embedded side at @xmath6 , while the one at @xmath17 observes it on the ch - only side at @xmath7 ( black dots in fig .",
    "this spectrometer configuration measures the femg - attenuated and -unattenuated spectra simultaneously , providing femg transmission spectra in a single experiment ( shot ) .",
    "however , taking advantage of this parallax , we can also infer the backlighter location with respect to the `` half - moon '' boundary ( i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 in fig .",
    "1 ) based on @xmath6 and @xmath7 as follows : @xmath18 assuming that the source - to - detector distance is much larger than @xmath6 - @xmath7 .    to extract @xmath6 and @xmath7 from the data , one has to understand the emergent intensity spatial profiles measured at @xmath12 ( fig .",

    "the hypothetical transmission spatial profile at a given wavelength ( blue ) is systematically lower at x@xmath190 due to the femg attenuation .",
    "the apparent backlighter spatial profiles ( green ) are centered at different locations with respect to the sample for the @xmath12 spectrometers ( i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) . while most of the backlighter spatial profile is attenuated through the femg region on the @xmath16 spectrometer ,",
    "only the backlighter wing is attenuated through femg on the @xmath17 spectrometer . as a result ,",

    "figure 3 shows the data recorded by the spectrometers at @xmath12 .",
    "each image is the average over four slit images to improve the signal - to - noise ratio and to average out random defects in the individual slit images@xcite .",
    "the horizontal ( spectral ) and vertical ( spatial ) axes are produced by the kap crystals and the slits , respectively .",
    "the dark vertical lines correspond to fe or mg bound - bound absorption lines .",
