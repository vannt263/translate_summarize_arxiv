    "the subject of partial differential equations related to generalized derivatives is a somewhat recent and unexploited research theme , with connections with physics and probability . by a generalized derivative we mean , _ grosso modo _ , a radon - nikodym derivative .",

    "a function @xmath11 for which @xmath12 is well defined and differentiable may have jump discontinuities at the discontinuity points of @xmath1 , namely the points with positive @xmath9-measure . in the section 2.7 of @xcite ,",
    "it was proven the existence of a unique weak solution belonging to the space @xmath13 , { h^1_w(\\mathbb t)})$ ] for the equation , where @xmath14 is a suitable sobolev - type space which admits discontinuous functions .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the class of measures @xmath9 for which the lebesgue measure is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "our main result is a continuous dependence of the unique solution @xmath3 of with respect to @xmath1 . by means of a sequence of transformations ,",
    "we not only solve the problem of continuity but we actually give an explicit construction of the weak solution .",
    "the subject of dynamics related to generalized derivatives has connections with different areas .",
    "for instance , the book @xcite studies one - dimensional markov processes whose generators involve radon - nikodym derivatives .",
    "in fractal analysis we cite @xcite .",
    "related to krein - fellers operators , see @xcite .",
    "partial differential equations related to this operator @xmath15 naturally come out in hydrodynamic limit and fluctuations of interacting particle systems in non - homogeneous medium , see @xcite .",
    "the equation is , for some cases of the measure @xmath9 , in correspondence with classical pde s .",
    "clearly , if @xmath9 is the lebesgue measure , the pde is equivalent to the classical heat equation in the one dimensional torus .",
    "additionally , in the case where @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the lebesgue measure , and @xmath18 is the dirac delta measure at zero , the pde is equivalent to the following heat equation with robin s boundary conditions : @xmath19 .",

    "notice that the boundary conditions above represent the fourier s law : the rate of heat transfer across the interface between two media is proportional to the difference of temperature in each medium . in this case",

    "our main theorem covers this last case with much more generality .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we present heuristics on how one can deduce an equivalent equation for the pde and the proof s scheme about continuous dependence of solutions with respect to @xmath1 . in section [ s3 ] precise definitions and statements",
    "are given . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we transform the equation into a classical pde with continuous weak solutions . in section [ s5 ]",
    "we deal with the continuous dependence of the equivalent version of by means of a careful analysis on its fourier transform .",
    "some auxiliary results are left to the appendix .",
    "in this section we informally discuss the subject of this paper and the proof s general idea .",
    "all arguments ahead are of heuristic nature .",
    "precise definitions and statements will be presented in the next section .",
    "is well known that the heat equation may be derived from fourier s law , which states that the heat transfer @xmath27 is proportional to the negative gradient of temperature @xmath3 , or else , @xmath28 an argument about conservation of energy leads to @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are functions of the position @xmath32 . in physical nomenclature , @xmath30 is the heat capacity and @xmath31 is the thermal conductivity .",
    "equation models the case where @xmath31 may be degenerate in the following sense : assuming for a moment that @xmath1 is differentiable , equation takes the form @xmath33 so @xmath34 is the inverse of @xmath31 and represents the thermal resistance .",
    "fourier s law takes henceforth the form @xmath35 when @xmath1 is not differentiable ( possibly not even continuous ) , we shall interpret this equality with @xmath34 and @xmath36 as schwartz distributions , and @xmath27 a continuous function .",
    "let us consider the case when @xmath37 , hence @xmath1 and @xmath3 must have both a jump discontinuity at @xmath38 . from , we see that the ratio between the size of the jumps is the heat transfer at that point",
    ". this agrees with the robin s boundary conditions in mentioned in the introduction .    keeping this interpretation in mind , we will reparametrize the interval @xmath39 $ ] in such a way that the thermal conductivity becomes constant , leading to a pde with the classical laplacian operator ( with possibly zero heat capacity at some points ) . roughly speaking",
    ", we are going to  stretch \" the support of the singular part of @xmath9 with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "for instance , as showed in the figure [ fig1 ] , the point @xmath40 in the left graphic is transformed into the interval @xmath41 $ ] in the right graphic .",
    "being @xmath1 a strictly increasing function , it has a continuous left inverse @xmath42 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] such that @xmath43 for all @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "as we shall see , a function @xmath45 with discontinuities at the same points as @xmath1 may be represented as a composition @xmath46 for some continuous function @xmath11 . under the change of variables @xmath47 ,",
    "equation becomes @xmath48 where , according to , the function @xmath49 plays the role of the heat capacity",
    ". the general strategy will be to establish the continuity of the solution @xmath50 of with respect to @xmath51 in a convenient function space , and then to prove that the composition @xmath52 is the solution of .",
    "this transformation puts together in the same space functions which are discontinuous in distinct sets . as usual",
    ", the topology on the measures will be given by the vague convergence .     and @xmath50 are related by @xmath53 . the grey line is a @xmath54-linear interpolation . ]    observe that if @xmath1 has a jump discontinuity at a point @xmath55 , namely @xmath56 , then @xmath57 in the interval @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "this corresponds to an interval with zero heat capacity and since reduces to @xmath59 , the temperature must be the linear interpolation of the values of @xmath50 at the end points of the interval , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this fact may be interpreted as an `` infinite dispersion '' phenomena : any initial temperature at @xmath58 $ ] is completely dispersed at any positive time , and the initial condition @xmath60 will be satisfied only when @xmath61 .",
    "this justifies the second equation in .    in principle",
    ", the function @xmath50 is defined only for @xmath62 . extending @xmath50 as zero in the negative half line",
    ", we can take the fourier transform with respect to time in , obtaining @xmath63 the term @xmath64 appears because @xmath50 is discontinuous at @xmath65 so @xmath66 has a dirac delta .",
    "now this equation is uncoupled in @xmath67 so it may be viewed as a one parameter family of periodic complex ode s @xmath68 with @xmath69 as the parameter .    at this point , the classical theory of ode s assures the existence of a unique solution that depends continuously on @xmath51 and @xmath67 .",
    "the main difficulty here is to show that we are able to anti - transform @xmath70 with respect to @xmath67 without loosing continuity .",
    "this is the subject of the section [ s5 ] .",
    "to a probability measure @xmath9 on the torus we can associate a unique right - continuous function @xmath6 such that @xmath71 , @xmath7 for every @xmath8 and such that if @xmath72 $ ] represents an interval in the torus then @xmath73 ) = w(b ) - w(a).\\ ] ] the function @xmath1 completely characterizes the measure @xmath9 .
