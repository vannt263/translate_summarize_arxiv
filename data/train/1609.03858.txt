    "a0620 - 00 was discovered on august 3 , 1975 by the ariel-5 satellite as a bright x - ray nova ( elvis et al . , 1975 ) and designated as v616 mon in the `` general catalogue of variable stars '' ( kholopov et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the precursor was detected on archival photographic plates at a magnitude of @xmath2 20.0 - 20.5 ( ward et al .",
    ", 1975 , eachus et al . , 1976 ) .",
    "the outburst light curves of the nova in x - ray , optical , infrared and radio wavelengths in 1975 - 76 were gathered by kuulkers ( 1998 ) .",
    "the nova reached 11.@xmath34 in the _ b - _ band ( shugarov , 1976 ) , 30 crab in x - rays and 200 mjy in the 962 mhz radio band .",
    "an outburst in x - rays was observed with satellites ariel-5 , sas-3 and with the x - ray detector `` filin '' on the ussr orbital station salyut-4 .",
    "the object was classified as a soft x - ray transient , and according to white et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , it was in a `` high state '' during most of the x - ray observations .",
    "the spectral changes during the rise to the outburst indicated a change from the `` low state '' to a high state . the different x - ray states ( quiescent , low , intermediate , high , very high ) depend on an increasing mass accretion rate through the accretion disk .",
    "after dramatic fading in the optical brightness in april 1976 ( martynov et al . , 1976 )",
    ", v616 mon passed into a quiescence ( lyuty & shugarov , 1979 ) .",

    "( 1976 ) detected the nova at two simeiz plates taken on january 20 , 1918 ( jd 2421461.2 ) and estimated its brightness as @xmath5 .",
    "two pairs of very short ( 0.5 - 5 ms ) flares were detected in quiescence on february 13 and 14 , 1986 by shvartsman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) with the 6-m bta telescope .",
    "the brightness temperature in the flare was at least @xmath6k , indicating non - thermal accretion onto a black hole .",
    "the blue - visual ( 4000 - 6400   fwhm ) passband and @xmath7 photometry and spectroscopy of the object taken by mcclintock & remillard ( 1986 ) showed that the object is a compact binary with the period of 0.3230141(4 ) days .",
    "the photometric binary cycle has a double hump structure as a result of the ellipsoidal shape of the red dwarf companion filling its roche lobe .",
    "the authors derived a mass function @xmath8 = 3.18@xmath90.16 m@xmath10 from the radial velocity curve of the red k5-k7 dwarf companion ( oke , 1977 ) and estimated the mass of the compact object to be @xmath11 3.2 m@xmath10 , so it is an excellent black - hole candidate .",
    "mcclintock & remillard ( 1986 ) determined the epoch of minimum light in the binary light curve ( lc ) at jd 244 5477.827 . using radial velocity measurements they established that this is the phase of an inferior conjunction of the compact object ( the black hole is in front of the red dwarf with respect to the observer ) .",
    "the @xmath12 photometry in the years 1991 - 95 confirmed the presence of the double humped light curve with a period of @xmath13 ( leibowitz et al . , 1998 ) . while there were no indications of a short - term variability , the mean brightness of the object varied on a time - scale of hundreds of days .",
    "subsequent @xmath14 photometry in 1999 - 2000 , obtained by gelino et al .",

    "they distinguished three distinct optical states .",
    "light curves in a `` passive '' state can be completely explained by periodic orbital variations and photometric errors .",
    "the `` loop '' and `` active '' states are characterized by the increases of scatter of observations . while a short time scale rms variability in the loop state was 0.05 mag in @xmath15 and 0.047 mag in @xmath17 , in the active state it reached 0.088 mag in @xmath15 and 0.057 mag in @xmath17 .",

    "2014 and references therein ) shifted by 0.5 in the orbital phase , to improve the light elements of the binary . for more precise spectroscopic data we applied the weight 10 times larger than for photometric ones .",

    "we clearly see that the phase lc for the whole time interval exhibits a large scatter , significantly higher than observational errors .",
    "the scatter of the data 0.2 - 0.4 mag , caused by a flickering , can increase to 0.6 mag in orbital phases 0.3  0.4 and 0.8  0.9 .",
    "flickering is due to the gaseous stream - accretion disk interaction in a bright spot , where the gas stream from the l1 point hits the outer edge of the accretion disk .",
    "bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and kononov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) performed three - dimensional gas - dynamical simulations for accretion disks and found that the spot at the disk is extended and has the shape of a `` hot line '' , or an arc .",
    "the extended hot line is best visible in the phases 0.3  0.4 and , due to the favorable inclination angle of the binary _ i _ = 50@xmath18 ( cantrell et al . , 2010 ) , it is partly visible also in the phases 0.8  0.9 .",
    "the position of the observer is approximately perpendicular to the hot line in these phases , so the flickering amplitude reaches the maximum .",
    "the lcs of v616 mon at six nights during the years 2003 - 2015 are illustrated in fig .",
    "the observations show a superposition of the orbitally - related wave variation and a rapid flickering variability with a characteristic time scale of about 30 min and the amplitude of 0.2 - 0.4 mag . while the orbital wave variation dominates all lcs , the largest flickering variability was detected in the years 2011 - 14 with its maximum in 2012 .",
    "we plotted also the night run variability of the field star , with approximately the same brightness , located close to v616 mon .",
    "the visible dispersion of the field star brightness shows the actual measurement accuracy of v616 mon . in 2015",
    "the amplitude of flickering decreased , so the system entered a non - active state .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , the last two outbursts of v616 mon occurred in 1917 and 1975 .",
    "if the outburst is triggered by a periodic mechanism , we can expect a new outburst during the next 10 - 20 years . in 2004 - 6 and 2009 - 14 active stages",
    "we observed flickering caused by an increase of the mass transfer from the red dwarf optical component to the accretion disk of the black hole ( shugarov et al . , 2015 ) .",
    "we have detected three types of brightness variations : mean brightness variations with a characteristic time from days to months , orbital lc variations caused by the ellipsoidal shape of the red dwarf component and irregular flickering variations arising in the black hole accretion disk and the bright spot , where the mass transfer stream hits the outer edge of the disk .",
    "v616 mon entered a non - active stage in the year 2015 .",
    "the fast brightness variability was also detected in other x - ray nova - black hole candidates , e.g. in v404 cyg ( pavlenko et al . ,",
    "1996 ; hynes et al .",
    ", 2002 ; shahbaz et al . , 2003 ) and",
    "kv uma ( gonzles hernndez et al . , 2014 ; pavlenko et al . ,",
    "2001 ) .    flickering is observed in all types of compact binaries consisting of a late - type star transferring matter onto an accreting white dwarf , a neutron star or a black hole",
    "many statistical properties of this variability can be naturally explained with the fluctuating accretion disk model , where variations in the mass - transfer rate through the disk are modulated on the local viscous timescale and propagate towards the central compact object ( scaringi , 2014 ) .",
    "the radiation produced by accretion is emitted through a release of gravitational potential energy .",
    "most of the radiation of accreting black holes and neutron stars is emitted in the inner parts of the accretion disk in x - rays , while optical radiation is emitted from the outer parts of the accretion disk .",
    "intrinsic brightness fluctuations on timescales of seconds to tens of minutes in mass - exchanging binaries were reviewed by baptista ( 2015 ) . in accreting white dwarf systems most of the radiation",
    "is emitted in the optical .",
    "the flickering originates either in the inner disk region and its boundary layer and/or in the hot spot , where the mass transfer stream hits the outer edge of its accretion disk .",
    "the lcs of classical , symbiotic and dwarf novae with a white dwarf compact object often indicate flickering , e.g. : v2468 cyg ( chochol et al . ,",
