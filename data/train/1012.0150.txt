    "regge poles method has been introduced in particle physics at the beginning of 60-ties @xcite and since that time it is widely used to describe the high - energy interactions of hadrons and nuclei .",
    "this method establishes an important connection between high energy scattering and spectrum of particles and resonances .",
    "also it was a starting point to develop the dual and string models of hadrons .",
    "although the apex of regge method in particle physics ended after the beginning of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) era , till present days it serves as a reliable tool to describe a variety of non - perturbative qcd processes .",
    "a regge trajectory @xmath8 is expressed commonly in terms of the center - of - mass energy squared @xmath9 of colliding particles . due to a crossing symmetry of strong interaction it is often used in @xmath10 or @xmath11 channels in terms of the mandelstam variables @xmath10 or @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 represents a set of leading regge poles on the complex plane of angular momentum .",
    "an astonishing ( approximate ) linearity of regge trajectories for the known hadronic states of mass @xmath13 and spin @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 , remains one of the unresolved problems of qcd despite some promising results obtained within the phenomenological planar models @xcite .",
    "up to now there is no consensus @xcite on a linearity of established regge trajectories of hadrons due to the lack of the experimental data on heavy resonances having spin above @xmath16 .",
    "however , it is necessary to mention that in 60-ies and 70-ies of last century a lot of efforts was put into study of the asymptotic behavior of regge trajectories for @xmath17 using their analytical properties in complex @xmath9-plane @xcite . under some general assumptions ( see later ) it was found @xcite that asymptotic regge trajectories can not grow faster than the linear function of @xmath9 and can not increase slower than the square root of @xmath9 for @xmath17 .",
    "this general result restricts the non - linear behavior from above , but it does not allow to rule out the nonlinear @xmath9-behavior that is weaker than 1 and stronger than @xmath18 .",
    "unexpectedly , a strong argument in favor of linear asymptotic behavior of regge trajectories of free hadrons was given in @xcite by the exactly solvable statistical model for quark gluon ( qg ) bags @xcite .",
    "this model is named the finite width model ( fwm ) since it accounts for finite width of qg bags .",
    "quite generally , the fwm demonstrates that free qg bags of mass @xmath19 gev that belong to the continuous mass - volume spectrum of the hagedorn type @xcite should have the mean width @xmath20 .",
    "such a behavior can be provided by the asymptotically linear regge trajectory @xcite only .",
    "moreover , the fwm shows that such a behavior of mean width of qg bags , but with the temperature dependent coefficient , remains valid at high temperatures .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to extract the parameters of the asymptotic regge trajectory predicted by the fwm using the experimental data . for our analysis",
    "we take the data of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons which are known with the highest accuracy for @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to the usual analysis which is restricted by searching for a connection between spin and mass of the trajectory members , we use the full regge trajectory in the complex @xmath9-plane .",
    "this allows us to simultaneously describe the masses and widths of involved mesons .",
    "such a task is very important nowadays since a great significance of the width of heavy resonances or bags for the realistic equation of state of strongly interacting matter @xcite and for a description of the fast equilibration process of heavy baryons / antibaryons @xcite and kaons / antikaons @xcite in relativistic heavy ion collisions was realized only recently .",
    "also our analysis is necessary for further development of the string model of hadrons and for improvement of such transport codes as the hadron string dynamics @xcite and the urqmd model @xcite by including the finite width of heavy resonances . in addition here",
    "we would like to demonstrate that a widely spread belief @xcite that the width of heavy hadronic resonances linearly depends on their mass is simply inconsistent with an existence of linear regge trajectories .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a brief analysis of the asymptotic regge trajectory properties which demonstrates that the resonance width is proportional to its mass for the asymptotically nonlinear trajectories only . in section 3",
    "we discuss two hypotheses to be verified and define the corresponding data sets to be fitted .",
    "the details of the fitting procedure and the discussion of the obtained results are given in section 4 , while section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "in the pre - qcd era a lot of efforts was put forward @xcite to determine the asymptotic behavior of regge trajectories of hadronic resonances . in our analysis",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and adopt the most general assumptions on the trajectory : ( i ) @xmath12 is an analytical function , having only the physical cut from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ; ( ii ) @xmath12 is polynomially restricted at the whole physical sheet ; ( iii ) there exists a finite limit of the phase trajectory at @xmath23 . using these assumptions , it was possible to prove @xcite that for @xmath23 the asymptotic behavior of regge trajectory at the whole physical sheet is @xmath24^\\nu \\,,\\quad { \\rm with } \\quad \\frac{1}{2 } \\le   \\nu \\le 1 \\ , .",

    "since our main interest here is related to the asymptotically linear trajectories , we restrict ourselves to the trajectories of the form @xmath29 \\,,\\quad { \\rm with } \\quad \\frac{1}{2 }   \\le \\nu \\le 1 \\ , , % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is real constant and the correction @xmath31 increases slower than @xmath32 in the limit @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 in this limit . since at the resonance position @xmath35 in the complex @xmath9-plane the trajectory defines its spin @xmath36 , one obtains @xmath37 = 0 $ ] .",
    "this condition allows one to determine the phase of physical trajectory from the equation @xmath38",
    "|s_r|^{-\\nu }    \\rightarrow   0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has a formal solution @xmath39     |s_r|^{-\\nu } $ ] .",
    "considering the complex energy plane @xmath40 , one can determine the mass @xmath41 and the width @xmath42 @xmath43 of a resonance belonging to the trajectory ( [ eqii ] ) .",
    "it is clear that positive values of resonance mass and width correspond to the inequalities @xmath44 which in the limit @xmath45 lead to the following conditions @xmath46 for the limiting cases @xmath47 and @xmath48 the positive value of width and mass , respectively , are determined by the small correction @xmath49     |s_r|^{-\\nu}$ ] in ( [ eqiii ] ) .",
    "( [ eqiii ] ) and ( [ eqiv ] ) clearly demonstrate us that only for an asymptotically nonlinear trajectories ( 5 ) the resonance width is proportional to its mass , i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "contrarily , for the linear trajectory @xmath47 the resonance width behaves as @xmath52     |s_r|^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\sim     \\frac{2 \\ ,   { \\rm i m } [ q(s_r ) ] } { |s_r| } \\",
    ", m_r \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last step we used expression ( [ eqiv ] ) for the resonance mass .",
    "since the function @xmath53 is a small correction to the linear @xmath9-dependence , from the right hand side equation ( [ eqvi ] ) one concludes that for asymptotically linear trajectories the width of heavy resonances can not be proportional to their mass since the ratio @xmath54}{|s_r| } \\rightarrow 0 $ ] for large @xmath55 .",
    "thus , we obtain a very important conclusion that only the asymptotically nonlinear regge trajectories ( [ eqii ] ) with @xmath56 lying between @xmath18 and @xmath57 lead to the linear mass dependence of resonance width , i.e. @xmath58 , whereas asymptotically linear regge trajectories ( [ eqii ] ) with @xmath27 generate weaker mass dependence of the width .",
    "however , this general analysis can not determine either the form of function @xmath53 or the range of @xmath9 at which such an asymptotic behavior is valid .",
    "fortunately , both of these questions can be answered within the fwm @xcite .",
    "thus , the fwm tells us that for excited resonances that belong to the continuous part of the mass - volume spectrum of qg bags the width dependence ( [ eqvi ] ) starts to develop already for @xmath19 gev . also it predicts that @xmath59 which leads to @xmath60 .",
    "such a conclusion gives a natural explanation of the observed huge deficit @xcite in the number of hadronic resonances compared to the statistical bootstrap model @xcite .",
    "using these results we conclude that the linear mass dependence of the resonance width assumed in @xcite can not not be used to model the decay of heavy qg bags .",
    "also it can be that application of the obtained results to the decay of hagedorn states @xcite can give quantitatively different outcome .",
    "the fwm predicts an existence of a universal regge trajectory for heavy qg bags .",
    "however , a determination of the parameters of such a trajectory immediately faces two principal difficulties .",
    "the first of these difficulties is that the universal trajectory corresponds to heavy ( excited ) resonances with mass above @xmath61 gev @xcite , while the experimental data in this region are absent .",
    "the second one is related to the fact that usual fitting procedure is not suited to this task .    for an analysis we choose the",
    "best studied trajectories @xcite of @xmath0 , @xmath2 mesons of isospin 1 , and of @xmath1 , @xmath3 mesons of isospin 0 with @xmath4 .",
    "nowadays there are three mesons in each of these trajectories @xcite .",
    "these mesons are well suited to our purpose since , firstly , the parameters of their trajectories are close to each other @xcite , and , secondly , the masses of @xmath62 and @xmath63 mesons are @xmath64 gev and @xmath65 gev , respectively , i.e. their masses are close to the value of @xmath66 . since here we would like to simultaneously fit the masses and the widths of resonances , we restrict ourselves to an analysis of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons because among other hadrons consisting of @xmath11- and @xmath67-quarks only the light hadronic resonances are well studied compared to these mesons . also here we do not examine the hadrons representing the heavier quark flavors , since they require a separate analysis .    although the trajectories of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons are similar , they are not identical . since there is no a priori knowledge on what trajectory is more close to the asymptotic one , we can not reject any of the data points by claiming that one of the data set is wrong .",
    "also we can not simply fit all trajectories by the same set of parameters since in many cases the masses and width of the mesons with same value of resonance spin @xmath68 are rather different and their error bars even do not overlap . therefore , our first task is to determine the correct set of data to be fitted with the corresponding errors .",
    "the non - zero difference of meson masses of the same spin is a reflection of the chiral symmetry breaking in the confined phase .",
    "it is expected that for excited mesons the effect of chiral symmetry breaking gets weaker @xcite .",
    "this expectation is in line with the fwm prediction of the universal trajectory existence .",
    "however , from the practical point of view it is necessary to account the effect of chiral symmetry breaking into the fitting procedure .",
    "clearly , the natural measure of the chiral symmetry breaking , which has to be included into the fitting , is the mass difference of @xmath69 for odd values of @xmath68 and @xmath70 for even @xmath68 values .",
    "since the mass differences @xmath71 and @xmath72 are much smaller than the masses of corresponding mesons , i.e. the chiral symmetry breaking effect is small , then it seems reasonably to expect that the universal trajectory should be located very close to or inside of the mass interval of mesons having the same spin .",
    "the same , of course , should be true for the resonance width .",
    "in addition it is necessary to account for the experimental errors of resonance masses and widths .",
    "therefore , the * hypothesis a * to be verified by the fit of experimental data is as follows : for the spin @xmath68 the mass and width defined by the universal trajectory are located within the interval @xmath73 , \\\\   % \\label{eqviii } \\hspace*{-0.4 cm } \\gamma_r^{exp } & \\in &   [ \\min\\ { \\gamma_j^{min } - \\delta \\gamma_j^{min } ;   \\gamma_j^{max } - \\delta \\gamma_j^{max } \\ } ; ~ \\max\\ {   \\gamma_j^{min } + \\delta \\gamma_j^{min } ; \\gamma_j^{max } + \\delta \\gamma_j^{max } \\ } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively . here",

    "thus , our fitting hypothesis * a * relies on the maximal uncertainty in the experimental mass and width values , which , on the one hand , allows us to account for the experimental splitting in the masses and widths of resonances , and , on the other hand , to reduce an individual influence of each of four trajectories analyzed . such an assumption allows us to determine the mean values of mass and width to be fitted for each @xmath68 as @xmath78 , \\,\\\\",

    "the reason for such a behavior is that the mass and width uncertainties of set * a * are essentially smaller for the resonances of spin @xmath91 than for that ones of higher spin values .",
    "exactly the same behavior we obtained while examining the individual trajectories of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons .",

    "an evident origin for such outcome of the fit is rooted in very small experimental errors of @xmath94 and @xmath95 mesons compared to the errors of @xmath96 meson .",
    "clearly , the large value of @xmath97 for the @xmath0 trajectory is generated by the @xmath96 meson data points .",
    "after realizing this fact we examined the stability of the obtained results .",
    "for this purpose we formulated the hypothesis * b * and analyzed it . comparing the data sets * a * and * b * , from table 1 it is clearly seen that the main difference between them is due to the value of errors : in contrast to the set * a * , all errors for the set * b * are chosen to be equal to @xmath83 ( democratic choice ) .",
    "the results of the set * b * fitting are given in tables 1 and 2 and shown in figs .",

    "can see that the obtained fit corresponds much better to the data trend of set * b*. in fact , there are only two data points , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which are about @xmath100 mev off the corresponding experimental values .",
    "such a result seems to be a remarkable success for the trajectory ( [ eqxiii ] ) which is expected to be valid in the limit @xmath26 .    from table 2",
    "it is seen that the most sensitive parameter to the change of data sets is @xmath101 , whereas @xmath102 and @xmath103 are almost insensitive parameters and @xmath104 demonstrates a moderate sensitivity . also from this table it is clear that the values of the fitting parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 are in good agreement with the corresponding parameters obtained by other groups @xcite .",
    "now it is necessary to chose the best fit .",
    "although for the common error @xmath105 mev the found value of @xmath106 for the set * b * is slightly larger than that one for the set * a * , one can not simply favor the fit * a * on the basis of smaller @xmath85 value .",

    "clearly , the re - scale of the common error @xmath83 would not change the values of fitting parameters and the minimum location for the set * b*. therefore , it seems that the hypothesis * b * with the common error @xmath110 is more probable than the hypothesis * a * , but rather small value of @xmath109 does not allow us to simply reject it .",
    "thus , we need some additional criterion to favor one of these hypotheses .",
    "such a criterion is provided by the fwm which predicts the asymptotic behavior of the width of large / heavy qg bags on the basis of the lattice qcd data .",
    "indeed , the fdm @xcite allows one to extract the asymptotic mass dependence of the qg bag width @xmath111 of the mean volume @xmath112 and mass @xmath41 @xmath113 from a variety of the lattice qcd data @xcite for vanishing baryonic density . here",

    "this is the case for the set * b*. thus , the data on early freeze - out temperature favor the hypothesis * b*.    the early freeze - out temperature was for the first time established for @xmath134- , @xmath135-mesons and @xmath136-hyperons at sps laboratory energy @xmath137 gev @xcite and for @xmath138-mesons and @xmath136-hyperons at rhic energy @xmath130 gev @xcite . the same conclusion on the early hardonization phenomenon is supported by the recent analysis of transverse momentum spectra of @xmath134- , @xmath138-mesons and @xmath136 at the top rhic energy @xmath139 gev @xcite . a systematic study of the connection between the early kinetic freeze - out of these hadrons and their hadronization process has begun from the work @xcite ( see also the recent review article @xcite ) .",
    "also we would like to draw an attention to the discrepancies between the experimental data on the resonance width and their fits .",
    "their mass dependence is shown in fig .",
    "3 . as one can deduce from fig .",
    "3 the difference between each data set and its fit has some periodic structure , which is more clearly seen for the set * b*. indeed , fig . 3 for the set *",
    "b * shows that the width of mesons with @xmath140 and @xmath141 slightly exceeds the fit values , the width of @xmath81 meson is somewhat smaller than the fit , while the width of mesons with @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 almost matches the width of the asymptotic regge trajectory .",
    "the developed approach would allow us to accurately extract such a fine structure , if the experimental uncertainties were smaller .",
    "therefore , to firmly establish this fine structure of the resonance width compared to the asymptotic regge trajectory we need much more accurate data for all analyzed mesons .",
    "however , if this fine structure , indeed , exists , then the mean width of the mesons of spin @xmath145 ( and mass @xmath146 gev ) should be @xmath147 gev instead of the set * b * fit value @xmath148 gev , while the mean width of the meson of spin @xmath149 ( and mass @xmath150 gev ) should match the fit * b * value @xmath151 gev , where for an a priori uncertainty we used the critical value of the common error @xmath152 for the set * b*. note that the list of non - strange mesons in @xcite contains the meson x(2750 ) of spin @xmath145 , mass @xmath153 gev and width @xmath154 , which are very close to our estimate that includes the fine structure discussed above , but , unfortunately , we can not make a definite conclusion because other quantum numbers of this meson are unknown .",
    "here we analyze the asymptotic behavior of regge trajectories of non - strange mesons . using the approach of @xcite",
    "we show that a circulating belief that the width of heavy hadrons linearly depends on their mass simply contradicts to an existence of asymptotically linear regge trajectories which is expected to be the case by the open string model @xcite , the closed string model @xcite , the anti - de - sitter conformal field theory @xcite and the fwm @xcite .",
    "we analyze the common data sets for masses and widths of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons for the spin values @xmath4 in order to elucidate the parameters of the asymptotically linear regge trajectory that is consistent with the fwm predictions .",
    "thus , we verified the hypotheses * a * and * b * , which differently define the data uncertainties .",
    "since the suggested fitting procedure employes the exact expressions for the resonance mass and width derived from the regge trajectory in the complex energy plain , we obtained a high quality fit .",
    "thus , it is shown that both data sets , * a * and * b * , can be fitted with rather small value of @xmath85 per degree of freedom of about @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , we used the results of the fit to estimate the cross - over temperature value based on the predictions of the fwm and obtained @xmath127 $ ] mev for the set * a * and @xmath128 $ ] mev for the set * b*. as it is argued the cross - over temperature obtained from the set * a * is incompatible with the early freeze - out temperature of @xmath134- , @xmath138- , @xmath135-mesons and @xmath136-hyperons found out for the laboratory energies at and above @xmath137 gev , while the cross - over temperature of the set * b * is consistent with the early freeze - out temperature of these particles .",
    "also a close inspection of the mass dependence of resonance width for the analyzed mesons led us to a conclusion of a possible fine ( periodic ) structure compared to the asymptotic behavior of the regge trajectory .",
    "this result might be of a great interest for the string models of hadrons .",
    "however , to firmly establish an existence of such a structure we need , firstly , a higher accuracy of experimental data and , secondly , a thorough verification of the predictions made for the widths and masses of the resonances of spin 7 and 8 .",
    "such experimental research will definitely allow us to make more concrete predictions for the asymptotic properties of heavy hadronic resonances .",

    "<S> in contrast to an existing belief , it is demonstrated that for the asymptotically linear regge trajectories the width of heavy hadrons can not linearly depend on their mass . using the data on masses and widths of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons for the spin values @xmath4 </S>",
