    "it is by now clear @xcite that , in a universe with zero cosmological constant , a combination of cold plus hot dark matter is needed for fitting the data on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and large scale structure @xcite in the universe , especially for essentially flat spectrum of the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "the energy density @xmath1 of the universe is taken equal to its critical value @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , as suggested by inflationary cosmology , and assumed to consist solely of matter ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "about 10@xmath5 of matter is baryonic ( @xmath6 ) , while the rest ( dark matter ) contains a hot component with density equal to about 20@xmath5 of the critical density ( @xmath7 ) and a cold one with @xmath8 .",
    "the present value of the hubble parameter in units of @xmath9 is taken to be @xmath10 .",
    "hot dark matter may consist of light neutrinos .",
    "this is compatible with the atmospheric @xcite and solar neutrino oscillations , within a three neutrino scheme , only if light neutrino masses are almost degenerate . a consistent supersymmetric inflationary model with degenerate",
    "light neutrino masses providing the hot dark matter in the universe has been constructed in ref.@xcite .",
    "cold dark matter , in the case of vanishing cosmological constant , must satisfy the relation @xmath11 .",
    "recent observational developments , however , seem to hint towards an alternative picture for the composition of the energy density of the universe with a nonvanishing contribution from something like a cosmological constant .",
    "measurements @xcite of the cluster baryon fraction combined with the low deuterium abundance constraint @xcite on the baryon asymmetry of the universe , @xmath12 , suggest that the matter density is around 35@xmath5 of the critical density of the universe ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "also , recent observations @xcite favor the existence of a cosmological constant , whose contribution to the energy density can be as large as 65@xmath5 of the critical density ( @xmath14 ) , driving the total energy density close to its critical value as required by inflation .",
    "the assumption that dark matter contains only a cold component leads then to a ` good ' fit @xcite of the cmb radiation and both the large scale structure and age of the universe data .",
    "higher values of the hubble constant ( @xmath15 ) are , however , required and , thus , @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , the possibility of improving this fit by adding light neutrinos as hot dark matter appears @xcite to be rather limited . we can , thus , assume hierarchical neutrino masses in this case . a consistent supersymmetric picture leading ` naturally ' to hybrid inflation and employing hierarchical neutrino masses has been presented in ref.@xcite . in the presence of a nonvanishing cosmological constant",
    ", cold dark matter must satisfy @xmath17 .",
    "both these cosmological models with zero / nonzero cosmological constant , which provide the best fits to all the available data , are equally plausible alternatives for the composition of the energy density of the universe .",
    "thus , taking into account the observational uncertainties , we will restrict @xmath18 in the range @xmath19 .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is one of the most promising candidates for cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "this is normally the lightest neutralino and its stability is guaranteed by the presence of a discrete @xmath20 matter parity , which implies that supersymmetric particles can disappear only by annihilating in pairs .",
    "the cosmological relic density of the lightest neutralino can be reliably computed , for various values of the parameters of mssm , under the assumptions of gauge coupling unification and radiative electroweak breaking with universal boundary conditions from gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( see e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "coannihilation @xcite of the lsp with the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) turns out to be crucial in many cases @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to estimate the lightest neutralino relic density in a specific mssm framework @xcite of the above variety , where the three yukawa couplings of the third family of quarks and leptons unify ` asymptotically ' ( i.e. , at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale @xmath21 ) .",
    "this can arise by embedding mssm in a supersymmetric gut based on a gauge group such as @xmath22 or @xmath23 , where all the particles of one family belong to a single representation .",
    "it is then obvious that requiring the masses of the third family fermions to arise primarily from their unique yukawa coupling to a particular superfield representation ( say a 10-plet of @xmath22 ) predominantly containing the electroweak higgses guarantees the desired yukawa coupling unification .",
    "this scheme predicts large @xmath24 , as well as the successful ` asymptotic ' mass relation @xmath25 . the supersymmetric particle spectrum , top quark mass and higgs scalar masses in this model",
    "have been studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "the top quark mass is ` naturally ' restricted to large values compatible with the present experimental data and the supersymmetric particle masses are predicted relatively large .",
    "the lightest neutralino is an almost pure bino , whereas the nlsp is the lightest stau mass eigenstate .",
    "coannihilation of the bino with the nlsp turns out to be of crucial importance for keeping the bino relic density at an acceptably low level .",
    "this implies that the lightest stau must not be much heavier than the bino so that coannihilation can be effective .",
    "moreover , increasing the lightest stau to bino mass ratio leads to a larger bino mass which further enhances its relic density .",
    "lightest stau masses of about @xmath0 larger than the bino mass are required for obtaining @xmath18 in the range @xmath19 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for smaller ` relative ' mass gaps between the lightest stau and the bino , @xmath26 rapidly decreases and becomes unacceptably small .",
    "the values of this mass gap which we find here combined with the fact that the bino mass turns out to be greater than about 222 gev make the lightest stau a phenomenologically interesting charged sparticle with mass which can be as low as @xmath27 232 gev .",
    "our analysis provides quite strong restrictions on the sparticle spectrum of mssm with yukawa coupling unification .    in sec.[sec :",
    "model ] , the mssm with yukawa coupling unification is introduced and its parameters and sparticle spectrum are constrained . in sec.[sec : relic ] , the relic lsp ( lightest neutralino ) density is calculated by taking into account its coannihilation with the nlsp ( lightest stau ) .",
    "in particular , the bino annihilation cross section is estimated in sec.[subsec : annih ] , whereas sec.[subsec : coan ] is devoted to the evaluation of the relevant coannihilation cross sections .",
    "our results on @xmath28 are presented and their consequences are discussed in sec.[subsec : result ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in sec.[sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider the mssm embedded in some general supersymmetric gut based on a gauge group such as @xmath22 or @xmath23 ( where all the particles of one family belong to a single representation ) with the additional requirement that the top , bottom and tau yukawa couplings unify @xcite at the gut scale @xmath29 .",
    "this requirement is easily guaranteed by ensuring that the masses of the third family fermions arise primarily from their unique yukawa coupling to a single superfield representation which predominantly contains the electroweak higgses .",
    "we further assume that the gut gauge symmetry breaking occurs in one step .",
    "ignoring the yukawa couplings of the first and second generation , the effective superpotential below @xmath29 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the quark and lepton @xmath33 doublet left handed superfields of the third generation and @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 the corresponding @xmath33 singlets .",
    "also , @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the electroweak higgs superfields and @xmath39 .",
    "the gravity - mediated soft supersymmetry breaking terms in the scalar potential are given by @xmath40 @xmath41 where the @xmath42 s are the ( complex ) scalar fields and tildes denote superpartners .",
    "the gaugino mass terms in the lagrangian are @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the bino , winos and gluinos respectively .",
    "` asymptotic ' yukawa coupling unification implies @xmath47 based on @xmath48 supergravity , we take universal soft supersymmetry breaking terms at @xmath29 , i.e. , a common mass for the scalar fields @xmath49 , a common trilinear scalar coupling @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "also , a common gaugino mass @xmath52 is assumed at @xmath29 .",
    "our effective theory below @xmath29 depends on the parameters ( @xmath53 ) @xmath54 the quantities @xmath55 ( @xmath56 being the gut gauge coupling constant ) and @xmath29 are evaluated consistently with the experimental values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "we integrate numerically the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for the mssm at two loops in the gauge and yukawa couplings from @xmath29 down to a common supersymmetry threshold @xmath60 . from this energy to @xmath59 ,",
    "the rges of the nonsupersymmetric standard model are used .",
    "the set of rges needed for our computation can be found in many references ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we take @xmath61 which , as it turns out , leads to gauge coupling unification at @xmath29 with an accuracy better than 0.1@xmath5 .",
    "this allows us to assume an exact unification once the appropriate supersymmetric particle thresholds are taken into account .",
    "our integration procedure relies on iterative runs of the rges from @xmath29 to low energies and back , for every set of values of the input parameters , until agreement with the experimental data is achieved .",
    "the value of @xmath62 at @xmath63 is estimated using the experimental input @xmath64 and @xmath63 is fixed to be @xmath65 throughout our calculation . assuming radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , we can express the values of the parameters @xmath66 ( up to its sign ) and @xmath67 at @xmath63 in terms of the other input parameters by means of the appropriate conditions @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 are the soft supersymmetry breaking scalar higgs masses . here ,",
    "following ref.@xcite , we used the tree - level renormalization group improved scalar potential minimized at a scale comparable to the mass of the stop quark .",
    "this is adequate for our purposes since , as we find , the corrections to @xmath66 from the full one - loop effective potential in ref.@xcite are negligible .",
    "the sign of @xmath66 is taken to be negative ( with our conventions ) , which leads to acceptable predictions for @xmath71 in models with large @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the common value of the third generation yukawa coupling at @xmath29 is found by fixing the top quark mass at the center of its experimental range , @xmath72 .",
    "the value obtained for @xmath73 after including supersymmetric corrections is somewhat higher than the experimental limit @xcite .",
    "we are left with @xmath74 and @xmath50 as free input parameters .",
    "our results , as it turns out , depend very little on the exact value of @xmath50 which is , thus , fixed to zero in our calculation .",
    "the values of @xmath49 and @xmath52 are found as functions of the tree - level mass @xmath75 of the cp - odd higgs scalar @xmath76 , for each ` relative ' mass splitting between the nlsp ( lightest stau ) and the lsp ( almost a pure bino ) , as we will explain later .",
    "the value of @xmath75 is evaluate at @xmath63 which is comparable with @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "although the full one - loop corrections to @xmath75 ( from ref.@xcite ) are not totally negligible , we will ignore them here since their effect on the lsp relic density is small .",
    "the lsp is the lightest neutralino @xmath78 .",
    "the mass matrix for the four neutralinos is @xmath79 in the @xmath80 basis .",
    "here @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , @xmath84 are the mass parameters of @xmath44 , @xmath85 in eq.([gaugino ] ) . for the values of @xmath66 obtained from the radiative electroweak breaking conditions here ( @xmath86 ) , the lightest neutralino turns out to be a bino , @xmath44 , with purity @xmath87 .",
    "large @xmath88 and @xmath89 yukawa couplings cause soft supersymmetry breaking masses of the third generation squarks and sleptons to run ( at low energies ) to lower physical values than the corresponding masses of the first and second generation . furthermore , the large values of @xmath62 implied by the unification of the third generation yukawa couplings lead to large off - diagonal mixings in the sbottom and stau mass - squared matrices .",
    "these effects make the physical mass of the lightest stau significantly lower than the masses of the other squarks and sleptons ( see below ) .",
    "the nlsp is , thus , the lightest stau mass eigenstate @xmath90 and its mass is obtained by diagonalizing the stau mass - squared matrix @xmath91 in the gauge basis ( @xmath92 ) . here , @xmath93 is the soft supersymmetry breaking mass of @xmath94 and @xmath95 the tau lepton mass .",
    "the stau mass eigenstates are @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , with @xmath99 being the @xmath100 mixing angle .",
    "another effect of the large values of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 yukawa couplings is the reduction of the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath75 and , consequently , the other higgs boson masses to smaller values .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite found that , for every value of @xmath75 and a fixed value of @xmath101 , there is a pair of minimal values of @xmath49 and @xmath52 where the masses of the lsp and @xmath90 are equal .",
    "this is understood from the dependence of @xmath75 on @xmath49 and @xmath52 given in ref.@xcite : @xmath102 where all the coefficients are positive and @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which depend only on @xmath101 , are @xmath105 ( the constant turns out to be numerically close to @xmath106 ) .",
    "equating the masses of the lsp and @xmath90 is equivalent to relating @xmath49 and @xmath52 .",
    "then , for every @xmath75 , a pair of values of @xmath49 and @xmath52 is determined .",
    "note that eq.([mac ] ) implies the existence of an upper bound on @xmath75 since @xmath107 .",
    "we set here an upper limit on @xmath52 equal to @xmath108 , which keeps the sparticle masses below about @xmath109 consistently with our choice for @xmath63 ( = 1 tev ) .",
    "this limit constrains @xmath75 to be smaller than @xmath110 .",
    "on the other hand , the experimental searches for the lightest cp - even neutral higgs boson @xmath111 with mass @xmath112 set a lower limit on @xmath75 .",
    "taking into account radiative corrections @xcite in calculating @xmath112 , we found that this lower limit on @xmath75 is about @xmath113 .",
    "the highest values of @xmath112 , which are obtained as @xmath75 increases to its upper limit , lie between 125 and 130 gev .    following the procedure of ref.@xcite",
    ", one can determine @xmath49 and @xmath52 not only for equal masses of the lsp and nlsp but for any relation between these masses .",
    "we fix @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) . for every @xmath75 and a given ` relative ' mass splitting @xmath116 between the nlsp and lsp , we find @xmath49 and @xmath52 .",
    "they are depicted in fig.[masses ] as functions of @xmath75 for @xmath117=0.02 and 0.08 ( see sec.[subsec : result ] ) .",
    "we observe that , for fixed @xmath75 , @xmath52 increases with @xmath117 .",
    "thus , @xmath49 and the sparticle masses increase too with @xmath117 ( see eq.([mac ] ) ) .",
    "also , for fixed @xmath52 , @xmath75 is a decreasing function of @xmath117 . as a consequence , the upper bound on @xmath75 ( corresponding to @xmath118 )",
    "gets reduced as @xmath117 increases .",
    "this is why the curves in fig.[masses ] which correspond to higher @xmath117 s terminate at smaller @xmath75 s .",
    "as we will see , the cosmological bounds on @xmath28 will constrain @xmath117 .",
    "the relevant part of the sparticle spectrum as a function of @xmath75 , for @xmath117=0.047 , is shown in fig.[spectrum ] .",
    "the lsp mass , for @xmath117=0.02 , is also included .",
    "we now turn to the calculation of the cosmological relic density of the lightest neutralino @xmath119 ( almost pure @xmath44 ) in mssm with yukawa unification . as mentioned in sec.[sec : intro ] , @xmath120 increases to unacceptably high values as @xmath121 becomes larger .",
    "low values of @xmath121 are obtained when the nlsp ( @xmath90 ) is almost degenerate with @xmath119 . under these circumstances ,",
    "coannihilation of @xmath119 with @xmath90 and @xmath122 is of crucial importance reducing further the @xmath119 relic density by a significant amount .",
    "the important role of coannihilation of the lsp with sparticles carrying masses close to its mass in the calculation of the lsp relic density has been pointed out by many authors ( see e.g. , refs.@xcite ) . here , we will use the method described by griest and seckel @xcite . note that our analysis can be readily applied to any mssm scheme where the lsp and nlsp are the bino and stau respectively .",
    "the relevant quantity , in our case , is the total number density @xmath123 since the @xmath90 s and @xmath122 s decay into @xmath119 s after freeze - out . at cosmic temperatures relevant for freeze - out ,",
    "the scattering rates of these ( nonrelativistic ) sparticles off particles in the thermal bath are much faster than their annihilation rates since the ( relativistic ) particles in the bath are considerably more abundant .",

    "this contribution varies from about @xmath253 to about @xmath254 as @xmath117 increases from 0 to 0.1 ( this is the relevant range of @xmath117 as we shall see ) .",
    "the major contributions to @xmath255 come from the processes @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "however , many of the other relevant processes in table i ( like @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath177 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 ) have , in general , important contributions which can not be neglected ( @xmath263 , for large @xmath117 s and @xmath75 s , gives a major contribution ) .",
    "also , the reaction @xmath264 ( @xmath265 ) is enhanced for low values of @xmath75 ( and @xmath117 ) .",
    "the relative contribution of @xmath266 to @xmath267 , which can be either positive or negative , is less than about @xmath268 for all relevant values of parameters .    for @xmath212",
    ", the contribution of the @xmath119 annihilation to @xmath235 is very small ( @xmath269 ) .",
    "the corresponding contributions of @xmath251 and @xmath267 span the ranges @xmath270 and @xmath271 respectively as @xmath75 varies from 95 to 220 gev . for @xmath272 , however , the annihilation of @xmath119 s becomes very significant accounting for about @xmath273 of @xmath235 .",
    "the most important contribution ( @xmath274 of @xmath235 ) , in this case , comes from the coannihilation of @xmath119 with @xmath90 , whereas @xmath90 coannihilation with @xmath90 or @xmath275 accounts for about @xmath276 of @xmath235 .",
    "we see that , although @xmath119 annihilation is negligible for small @xmath117 s , it is strongly enhanced at higher values of @xmath117 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the abundance of @xmath90 s decreases relative to the one of @xmath119 s as @xmath117 increases .    for @xmath212",
    ", the contributions of @xmath250 and @xmath277 to @xmath235 cancel each other partially and , thus , an accurate result ( error @xmath278 ) can be obtained by ignoring these @xmath88 s . for @xmath272 , however , the contribution of @xmath250 dominates strongly over the one of @xmath266 and gives @xmath279 of @xmath235 .",
    "consequently , our results can be reproduced with an accuracy better than @xmath280 by using , for coannihilation , just the @xmath281 s .",
    "their analytical expressions have been given earlier in this section .",
    "on the contrary , the @xmath221 can not be ignored since its contribution to @xmath282 can be as high as @xmath283 and the annihilation of @xmath119 s is very significant at higher @xmath117 s .",
    "we can now proceed to the evaluation of @xmath28 .",
    "the top quark mass @xmath101 is again fixed at 166 gev . for given values of @xmath117 and @xmath75 ,",
    "all the particle physics parameters of the model are determined ( see sec.[sec : model ] ) .",
    "the freeze - out parameter @xmath284 can then be found by solving eq.([xf ] ) and @xmath235 is evaluated from eq.([sigmaeff4 ] ) .",
    "the lsp relic abundance @xmath120 is estimated using eq.([omega ] ) and is depicted in fig.[lsp ] as function of @xmath75 for @xmath117=0 , 0.02 , 0.047 and 0.08 .",
    "remember that the curves on this plot , which correspond to specific values of @xmath117 , terminate at the appropriate upper limit on @xmath75 ( derived from the restriction @xmath285 ) .",
    "this limit decreases as @xmath117 increases .    requiring @xmath120 to be confined in the cosmologically allowed range @xmath19 ,",
    "one finds that @xmath117 is restricted between @xmath27 0.02 and 0.08 .",
    "note that the upper limit on @xmath117 does not depend on our restriction on @xmath52 . on the contrary ,",
    "the lower limit on @xmath117 is somewhat dependent on the particular choice one makes for this restriction .",
    "this deserves further study which would require going beyond the simplifying assumption of a common supersymmetry threshold @xmath63 .",
    "it should be pointed out that this lower bound on @xmath117 is anyway evaded if there exist additional contributions to the cold dark matter of the universe from particle species other than @xmath119 .",
    "fig.[delta ] shows the cosmologically allowed region in the @xmath286 plane obtained from the above considerations .",
    "we see that @xmath75 can vary only between about 95 and 216 gev .",
    "the lower ( upper ) boundary of this region corresponds to @xmath287 ( 0.22 ) .",
    "the left boundary corresponds to @xmath118 ( @xmath288 ) . along this line",
    ", @xmath121 is essentially constant and acquires its maximal allowed value @xmath289 ( see fig.[spectrum ] ) .",
    "the minimal value of the lsp mass is obtained at the lower left corner of this allowed region , where @xmath290 , and is equal to about 222 gev ( see fig.[spectrum ] ) .",
    "we , thus , see that the lsp mass ranges between @xmath27 222 and 354 gev .",
    "the @xmath90 mass is bounded between about 232 and 369 gev which makes @xmath90 a phenomenologically interesting charged sparticle .",
    "the upper ( lower ) bound corresponds to the upper right ( lower left ) corner of the region in fig.[delta ] . actually , the whole sparticle mass spectrum is strongly restricted by our considerations . note , however , that the upper bounds on the sparticle masses depend on our choice for the maximal allowed @xmath52 .",
    "this requires a detailed study with inclusion of one - loop and supersymmetry threshold effects which may not be negligible for higher @xmath52 s .",
    "the relative contributions @xmath291 ( @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath211 ) of the three inclusive ( co)annihilation reactions to @xmath235 are given in fig.[sigma ] as functions of @xmath75 for the ` central ' value of @xmath292 .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath75 is @xmath293 gev in this case .",
    "we considered the mssm with gauge and yukawa coupling unification employing radiative electroweak symmetry breaking with universal boundary conditions from gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we calculated the relic density of the lsp ( an almost pure bino ) .",
    "coannihilation of the lsp with the nlsp ( the lightest stau ) is crucial for reducing its relic density to an acceptable level .",
    "compatibility with the mixed or the pure cold ( with a nonzero cosmological constant ) dark matter scenarios for structure formation in the universe requires that the lightest stau mass is about @xmath0 larger than the bino mass .",
    "this combined with the fact that the lsp mass is restricted to be greater than about 222 gev allows the lightest stau mass to be as low as 232 gev .",
