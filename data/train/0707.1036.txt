    "when particles such as atoms interact with each other at low temperatures , very often they exhibit remarkably distinct cooperative behaviors as a result of symmetry breaking .",
    "one of the most fascinating and distinct consequences is the possibility of observing quantum dynamics at a macroscopic level @xcite . in bose - einstein condensates of ultra - cold alkali atoms , macroscopic quantum phenomena related to coherent matter waves@xcite , ac josephson effects@xcite , and vortex lattices@xcite",
    "have all been observed .",
    "studies of these phenomena in ultra cold matter should eventually lead to applications such as cold - atom - based precise measurements .",
    "spin correlated macroscopic quantum dynamics have also been a focus of many cold atom experiments carried out recently .",
    "spin ordering and spin - relaxation collisions were first investigated in condensates of sodium atoms by inouye _",
    "et al . _ and miesner _",
    "et al . _ from ketterle s group at mit@xcite .",
    "coherent spin dynamics driven by various mean field interactions or external fields were later demonstrated in condensates of hyperfine spin - two rubidium atoms@xcite , and hyperfine spin - one rubidium atoms@xcite . ordering in spinor gases",
    "is usually induced by hyperfine spin dependent two - body scattering@xcite .",
    "coherent spin dynamics observed in experiments are related to the coherent quantum dynamics explored in solid state superconductors , and earlier experiments on ultra cold gases of atoms@xcite .",
    "they are explicit manifestations of fascinating macroscopic quantum states and can be potentially applied towards constructing high precision interferometers .",
    "remarkably , coherent dynamics also provide a unique direct measure of interaction energies or scattering lengths as emphasized before @xcite .",
    "quantum fluctuation - controlled spin dynamics or _ qfcsd _ we are going to study in this article on the other hand are a direct measure of quantum fluctuations ; they can be potentially used to calibrate quantum fluctuations and investigate correlated fluctuations near quantum critical points or universal scaling properties .",
    "furthermore , _",
    "qfcsd _ of cold atoms can be designed to simulate many other quantum - fluctuation - induced phenomena such as coleman - weinberg mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking@xcite , and order due to disorder in antiferromagnets@xcite .",
    "the system we are examining to understand _ qfcsd _ is a condensate of rubidium atoms ( @xmath0 ) in hyperfine spin - two ( @xmath1 ) states .",
    "the two - body scattering lengths between rubidium atoms have been estimated using both photoassociation data@xcite , and elastic scattering data near feshbach resonances@xcite .",
    "most recently , rabi oscillations between different two - spin states have also been used to measure spin dependent interactions@xcite .",
    "quantum fluctuations of spin collective coordinates at least have three different effects on spin dynamics .",
    "firstly , quantum fluctuations of wave lengths of condensate sizes usually result in finite - size quantum symmetry restoring . for a spinor condensate of a few million @xmath0",
    "( f=2 ) or @xmath2 ( f=1 ) atoms , restoring of spin rotational symmetry or quantum diffusion of spin orientation typically occurs at a time scale of a few tens of seconds .",
    "so they are not relevant to @xmath3 spin dynamics studied in large condensates .",
    "the second well - known effect is to renormalize semi - classical spin dynamics , such as spin wave velocities . in high dimensions , dominating contributions are usually from short wave length fluctuations ( in optical lattices the shortest wave length is set by lattice constants ) .",
    "these spin fluctuations might also result in quantum phase transitions between spin ordered and disordered states . for",
    "most dilute cold atom gases , the renormalization of spin dynamics is perturbative and negligible ( except around critical points ) .",
    "and in the limit that interests us , the relative amplitude of spin fluctuations is small .",
    "the third effect is to induce dynamics when conventional mean field dynamics are completely frozen out because of degeneracies in a submanifold .",
    "this is the limit of _ qfcsd _ that we are going to study .",
    "the dominating contributions in our case are mainly from quantum fluctuations of an _ intermediate _ wave length which is comparable to the de broglie wave length of an atom traveling with spin wave velocities .",
    "however it is quite challenging to probe qfcsd in traps without optical lattices , if not impossible .",
    "for dilute gases in the absence of optical lattices , the effective driving potential induced by quantum fluctuations is about @xmath4 per particle ( see section iii for more discussions ) because the relative amplitude of fluctuations is very small .",
    "the corresponding dynamics driven by such a small potential are only visible at a time scale of a few thousand seconds , too slow to be observed in current cold atom experiments .",
    "in addition , a tiny external magnetic field of strength @xmath5 can result in a quadratic zeeman coupling of order of @xmath6pk for rubidium atoms which is three orders of magnitude larger than the induced potential in dilute gases . in most experiments because of noises in lasers , the effective quadratic zeeman coupling can be controlled only up to a uncertainty that is equivalent to a magnetic field of an order of @xmath5 .",
    "this further complicates future experimental studies of qfcsd . to resolve these difficulties",
    ", we propose to enhance the effect of qfcsd using optical lattices . to vary the amplitude of quantum fluctuations and optimize the effect of fluctuations , we study",
    "_ qfcsd _ in optical lattices where the optical potential depth @xmath7 is a convenient tunable parameter@xcite .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce a lattice hamiltonian to study dynamics of @xmath0 atoms in optical lattices and discuss the range of parameters we have used to investigate this phenomenon . in section iii , we present our main numerical results on quantum - fluctuation induced potentials , frequencies of coherent dynamics , and how potentials and frequencies depend on optical lattice potential depth .",
    "we also study the dynamical stabilities of coherent oscillations when a quadratic zeeman coupling is present . in section iv , we discuss effects of thermal fluctuations and analyze the potential - depth dependence of thermal enhancement of induced driving potential . in section",
    "v , we further investigate effects of spin exchange losses and propose how to observe quantum - fluctuation - controlled spin dynamics within a relatively short life time of @xmath1 rubidium atoms . in section",
