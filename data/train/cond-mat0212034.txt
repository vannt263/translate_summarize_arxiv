    "the properties of many cerium or ytterbium compounds are well accounted for by the kondo - lattice model , where a strong competition exists between the kondo effect and magnetic ordering arising from the rkky ( ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ) interaction between rare - earth atoms at different lattice sites .",
    "this situation is well described by the doniach diagram,@xcite which gives the variation of the nel temperature and of the kondo temperature with increasing antiferromagnetic intrasite exchange interaction @xmath1 between localized spins and conduction - electron spins .",
    "if one considers the exchange hamiltonian between localized ( @xmath2 ) and conduction - electron ( @xmath3 ) spins , given by @xmath4 usual theories of the one - impurity kondo effect and of the rkky interaction yield a kondo temperature @xmath5 that is proportional to @xmath6 , and an ordering temperature ( nel or , in some cases , curie ) @xmath7 , proportional to @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the density of states for the conduction band at the fermi energy .",
    "thus , for small @xmath10 values , @xmath7 is larger than @xmath5 and the system tends to order magnetically , with often a reduction of the magnetic moment due to the kondo effect . on the contrary , for large @xmath10 , @xmath11 is larger than @xmath7 and the system tends to become non magnetic .",
    "the actual ordering temperature @xmath12 , therefore , increases initially with increasing @xmath10 , then passes through a maximum and tends to zero at a critical value @xmath13 corresponding to a `` quantum critical point '' ( qcp ) in the doniach diagram .",
    "such a behavior of @xmath12 has been experimentally observed with increasing pressure in many cerium compounds , such as ceal@xmath14 ( ref .  ) or cerh@xmath14si@xmath14.@xcite we also know that the nel temperature starts from zero at a given pressure , and increases rapidly with pressure in ybcu@xmath14si@xmath14 ( ref .  ) or in related ytterbium compounds , which can be considered as another test of the doniach diagram .",
    "the one - impurity model predicts an exponential increase of the kondo temperature with @xmath10 .",
    "this means that the kondo temperature should increase with increasing pressure in cerium compounds and with decreasing pressure in ytterbium compounds , in good agreement with many observations .",
    "however , deviations seem to occur in some cerium compounds , such as cerh@xmath14si@xmath14 ( ref .  ) or ceru@xmath14ge@xmath14,@xcite where the actual kondo temperature observed in a lattice can be significantly different from the one derived for the single - impurity case .",
    "thus , in order to account for such an effect , we have treated in a previous paper@xcite the kondo - lattice model with both intrasite kondo exchange and intersite antiferromagnetic exchange interactions , for a half - filled conduction band ( corresponding to a number of conduction electrons @xmath15 ) .",
    "we employed a mean - field approximation with two correlators , @xmath16 , describing the intrasite kondo correlation , and @xmath17 , representing an intersite correlation between two neighboring moments .",
    "we have shown that the enhancement of the intersite exchange interaction tends to decrease the kondo temperature @xmath18 for the lattice with respect to the one - impurity kondo temperature @xmath5 , and to suppress the kondo effect for large values of the intersite exchange interaction parameter.@xcite so , this model can account for the pressure dependence of @xmath18 observed in cerh@xmath14si@xmath14,@xcite ceru@xmath14ge@xmath14,@xcite or more recently@xcite ce@xmath14rh@xmath19ge@xmath20 .",
    "the above mentioned model also yields a correlation temperature @xmath21 , below which short - range magnetic correlations between neighboring cerium atoms occur . for sufficiently large values of the intersite exchange , @xmath22 is higher than the kondo temperature .",
    "this result is in agreement with the experimental observation by neutron diffraction experiments of such short - range magnetic correlations in single crystals of cecu@xmath23,@xcite ceincu@xmath14,@xcite ceru@xmath14si@xmath14,@xcite or ce@xmath24la@xmath25ru@xmath14si@xmath14 ( refs . ) at low temperatures .",
    "the experimentally observed temperature @xmath22 is clearly larger than the kondo temperature @xmath18 : @xmath26 6070 k and @xmath27 20 k in ceru@xmath14si@xmath14;@xcite @xmath26 10 k and @xmath28 5 k in cecu@xmath23.@xcite    most kondo - lattice models have been studied for the case of a half - filled conduction band , corresponding to a number of conduction electrons , @xmath29 , equal to the number @xmath30 of @xmath31 electrons .",
    "however , when @xmath32 , an `` exhaustion '' problem arises , which means that there are not enough conduction electrons to screen all the localized spins and , as a consequence , the kondo temperature decreases.@xcite the stability of the kondo effect when @xmath29 decreases has been recently studied,@xcite and also the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility has been computed for different values of @xmath29,@xcite with the hamiltonian including an intersite exchange interaction @xmath33 between the localized spins , treated as independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the results showed that a reduction of @xmath29 and/or an enhancement of @xmath33 tend to suppress the kondo effect .",
    "in particular , the analytical calculation at @xmath34 gave @xmath35 proportional to @xmath29 in the case of @xmath36.@xcite    early studies of the kondo - lattice model have considered only the intrasite kondo interaction.@xcite in particular , continentino et al.,@xcite using scaling theory , have found a coherence temperature increasing above the qcp .",
    "recently , burdin et al.,@xcite using the slave - boson method in the exhaustion limit , have obtained two different energy scales : the single - impurity kondo temperature @xmath18 , which corresponds to the onset of local singlet formation , and the zero - temperature energy gain , @xmath37 , related to the coherent kondo effect .",
    "thus , the low - temperature energy scale is not equal to the high - temperature one , although there is only one mean - field parameter in the theory.@xcite it has been shown that the ratio @xmath38 is much smaller than 1 , and depends only on the band filling factor . in the case of a rectangular density of states for the conduction band",
    ", @xmath18 vanishes as @xmath39 and the coherence temperature as @xmath29 in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "however , both @xmath18 and @xmath37 where found to exhibit the same exponential behavior @xmath41 , in contrast with the formula established by nozires,@xcite who found @xmath42 .",
    "the effect of a small number of conduction electrons has been also studied within both the kondo - lattice and the anderson - lattice models.@xcite    the purpose of the present paper is to further develop the study of conduction - band filling effects within the kondo - lattice model . besides previous work cited above,@xcite a first brief account",
    "has been already given,@xcite but we will present here both numerical results and new analytical expressions for some specific limits , as well as a detailed discussion of band - filling effects .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the kondo - lattice model is often studied with only the intrasite kondo interaction . in principle , both the rkky magnetic interaction and the kondo effect are consequences of the intrasite exchange term . however , the rkky interaction is perturbative in @xmath1 while the kondo effect is not.@xcite when dealing with approximation schemes , it is hard to obtain both effects starting with the intrasite interaction alone . for this reason ,",
    "an explicit intersite exchange interaction is usually included in the model hamiltonian.@xcite    the proposed hamiltonian of the system is , therefore , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the energy of the conduction band , @xmath45 is the kondo coupling between a localized spin @xmath46 and the spin @xmath47 of a conduction electron at the same site , and @xmath33 is the interaction between nearest - neighboring localized spins .",
    "assuming spin-1/2 localized moments , we represented them by a zero - width @xmath31 band with one electron per site , while the conduction band has width @xmath48 and a constant density of states .",
    "we choose @xmath45 and @xmath33 to be positive , implying that both local and intersite interactions are antiferromagnetic , as is the case in most cerium compounds .",
    "we now write the spin operators in fermionic representation : @xmath49 remembering that we have a constraint of single - occupancy of the @xmath31 level at all sites , @xmath50 .    in order to discuss the kondo effect and magnetic correlations",
    "we define the operators @xmath51 where @xmath16 describes the intrasite kondo correlation , and @xmath17 represents an intersite correlation between two neighboring atoms .",
    "this is so because the on - site spin - spin correlation @xmath52 can be written in terms of the average @xmath53 , and similarly for the intersite correlation using @xmath17 . with this notation",
    "we perform an extended mean - field approximation , introduced by coleman and andrei,@xcite and presented in full detail in ref .",
    ". considering translational invariance , and taking into account that there is no breakdown of spin symmetry , i.e. , no magnetic states , we can write @xmath54 for all sites , and @xmath55 for nearest - neighboring sites and zero otherwise . in this way we obtain a mean - field hamiltonian that takes the form of a hybridized two - band system : @xmath56 with @xmath57 @xmath58 being the total number of lattice sites .",
    "we have introduced a term depending on the lagrange multiplier @xmath59 in order to impose the constraint @xmath60 .",
    "this is a weak form of the original constraint @xmath50 .    after performing this approximation , one deals with a one - electron hamiltonian representing two hybridized bands : the conduction band of width @xmath48 and the @xmath31 band of effective band width @xmath61 , with @xmath62 given by @xmath63 @xmath64 being the number of nearest neighbors of a site , while the magnitude of the hybridization gap is directly related to @xmath35 .",
    "this quantity is also a measure of the kondo effect , as the kondo correlation function @xmath65 is proportional to @xmath66 .    the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hmf ] ) , leaving aside the constant terms , is easily diagonalized , and the resulting energies of the two new hybrid bands are @xmath67 ^ 2 + 4 j_k^2 \\lambda^2 } \\ ; \\bigg ] \\:\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the mean - field parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 are obtained by self - consistently solving eqs .",

    "we have previously treated the half - filled case , corresponding to a number of conduction electrons @xmath75,@xcite and here we consider the general case of a non - integer number of conduction electrons . for the half - filled case,@xcite",
    "we have shown that the kondo temperature @xmath18 for the lattice can be much smaller than the kondo temperature @xmath76 for the single impurity , as observed in some cerium compounds .",

    "the fermi level cuts the lower band , and the upper band is still empty at @xmath81 , which corresponds , therefore , to a real metallic situation .",

    "the open circle signals @xmath22 , while the filled circles indicate the positions of @xmath153 for the three higher values of @xmath29 ( the kondo regime no longer occurs for @xmath170).,width=321 ]    finally , in figure [ fig : sus ] , we present a plot of the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature for the three different regimes for typical sets of parameters : kondo regime alone ( small @xmath97 , @xmath29 near half - filling ) , both magnetic correlations and kondo regimes ( higher @xmath97 , smaller @xmath29 ) , and short - range magnetic correlations only ( still higher @xmath97 , relatively small @xmath29 ) .",

    "[ fig : susxt1].,width=321 ]    the different behaviors shown in the last three figures are worth analyzing in more detail . at high temperatures , the magnetic susceptibility is decreasing in @xmath171 as normally expected .",
    "then , below the highest characteristic temperature ( @xmath22 or @xmath18 ) , there is a rapid decrease of the product @xmath167 , indicating a reduction of the effective magnetic moment due to the occurence of short - range antiferromagnetic correlations , which tend to reduce the response of the localized moments to an applied magnetic field , and an even faster reduction due to the kondo effect . at lower temperatures , within the kondo regime",
    ", we observe a flattening of the effective magnetic moment .",
    "this region of nearly constant magnetic moment below @xmath153 can be related to the `` exhaustion '' problem , because there are not enough electrons to screen the localized spins . at still lower temperatures , a coherent regime sets in , and",
    "this residual moment becomes completely screened .",
    "this behavior is not observed in the half - filled case , where the effective magnetic moment tends very rapidly to zero due to the existence of a gap at the fermi level .",
    "we have studied the different behaviors of the intra - site and inter - site correlations , and the characteristic temperatures as a function of the intrasite kondo exchange coupling , of the intersite exchange coupling , and of the number of conduction electrons relative to the number of @xmath31 electrons , which remains fixed to 1 .",
    "we use here a mean - field approximation with two order parameters in each case , the mean - field kondo correlator and the short - range magnetic correlation .",
    "we have established here for @xmath96 , as in previous work@xcite for @xmath15 , that the dependence of the kondo temperature with the coupling constant @xmath1 for the lattice can be significantly different from the single - impurity case .",
    "this result can account for the pressure dependence of @xmath18 observed in cerh@xmath14si@xmath14,@xcite ceru@xmath14ge@xmath14,@xcite or more recently ce@xmath14rh@xmath19ge@xmath20.@xcite on the other hand , depending on the relative values of @xmath97 and @xmath1 , as well as on the band - filling , the lattice kondo temperature can closely follow the single - impurity one , as observed in many cerium and all ytterbium compounds .",
    "further experiments are needed to better understand the conditions yielding a kondo temperature for the lattice much different than the single - impurity one .",
    "this issue has also been addressed by different theoretical approaches to both the kondo lattice and the periodic anderson model.@xcite    another interesting result concerns the derivation of a _ correlation temperature _ below which short - range magnetic correlations appear , in good agreement with neutron scattering experiments in cerium compounds .",
    "these correlations can coexist with the kondo effect , but eventually dominate , and suppress the kondo regime for sufficiently high values of the intersite exchange interaction or sufficiently low band fillings .",
    "our present calculation addresses again the difficult issue of the nature of the ground state and screening in the kondo - lattice problem .",
    "we have shown here that , as the number of conduction electrons is reduced , exhaustion may be compensated by formation of intersite singlets of localized spins .",
    "exact calculations for small clusters would be interesting in that a comparison between results with a number of conduction electrons equal to , or much smaller than the number of 4@xmath31 electrons localized on the different sites of the clusters could shed new light on this issue.@xcite finally , it is interesting to notice that taking into account lattice effects is essential for describing the properties of cerium or other anomalous rare - earth compounds at low temperatures , as shown , for example , in photoemission experiments.@xcite    99 s. doniach , proceedings of the `` int .",
