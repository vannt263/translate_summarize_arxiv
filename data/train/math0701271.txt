    "it is well known that the fluctuation properties of a lvy process are intimately related to the wiener - hopf factorization of its lvy exponent @xmath0 . the observation ( initiated by spitzer @xcite for random walks ) that the factorization of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a positive constant , can be interpreted as the independence of the past and pre minimum parts of the lvy process killed at an independent exponential time .",
    "the wiener - hopf factors yield the distributions of the minimum and the maximum of the killed process .",
    "also the problem of exit from a semi - infinite interval which consists in determining the joint distribution of the exit time of an interval @xmath3-\\infty , x]$ ] and of the position at the exit time , can be reduced to finding the wiener - hopf factorization , see @xcite@xcite@xcite . in the theory of analytic functions ,",
    "wiener - hopf factorization is the simplest of a large class of factorization problems known as riemann - hilbert problems . in this paper",
    "we establish a connection between the joint distribution of the maximum , minimum and final value of the lvy process killed at an independent exponential time and a certain riemann - hilbert factorization problem .",
    "the determination of this joint distribution allows to compute the joint law of the position and the time of the exit of a lvy process from a bounded interval .",
    "more precisely , we prove that this problem reduces to the factorization of the matrix @xmath4 where @xmath0 is the lvy exponent of the process , into a product @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are matrices which are boundary values , on the imaginary axis , of analytic functions , defined respectively on the left and on the right complex half planes , satisfying a normalization at infinity involving a positive real parameter @xmath8 . in order to obtain this result",
    "we establish that a set of functions , defined from the laplace transforms of random variables involving the maximum and minimum processes associated with the lvy process , satisfy a certain system of integral equations .",
    "we show that this system of integral equation is analogous to the basic differential system appearing in scattering theory on the real line .",
    "our system does not reduce to the usual problem of scattering theory , since the associated potential is very singular compared to the potentials considered in this theory .",
    "the analogy however is sufficiently good that we can apply similar arguments as in the work of shabat @xcite , and show the equivalence of our system of integral equations with a riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall some basic facts on lvy processes and the wiener - hopf factorization .",
    "then we introduce the main functions of our work and state the two main theorems .",
    "the first one gives a system of integral equations satisfied by the functions , and the second one states that this system is equivalent to a certain riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "we explain why the first theorem is related to the differential equation and the direct problem of the scattering theory while the second one is related to the inverse scattering problem . in section 3",
    "we explain the connection between the main results and the exit problem from an interval and related questions .",
    "section 4 contains a preliminary result on the conditional independence of the pre and post minimum process , knowing the amplitude . in section 5",
    "we establish the first equation of the integral system .",
    "section 6 deals with the second group of equations . in this part",
    "we introduce two markov chains , built from the successive minima and maxima of the process , which play a key role in the proof . in section 7 we establish the second theorem , about the riemann - hilbert problem , by adapting the arguments of shabat @xcite to our setting .",
    "we give some probabilistic interpretations of the factorization in the riemann - hilbert problem in section 8 in terms of wiener - hopf factorization of certain auxiliary lvy processes .",
    "finally , section 9 is devoted to apply our results to stable processes and to lvy processes without positive jumps .",
    "this allows us to give some precisions on results obtained by rogozin @xcite for the stable case and by takacs @xcite for lvy processes without positive jumps .",
