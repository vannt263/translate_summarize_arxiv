    "we use the data compilation by caldwell & bergvall ( 2006 ) consisting of a sample of 1199 close to edge - on ( @xmath0 ) low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies in the fourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - dr4 ) .",
    "all galaxies in the sample were selected in order to obtain a sample of isolated , bulge - less systems , which is ideal for comparison with simple cems since the merger histories of such galaxies have less influence on the evolution of elemental ratios .",
    "this total sample is divided by @xmath1 colour limits into a blue sample a ( 377 galaxies ) , a green ( intermediate ) sample b ( 436 galaxies ) and a red sample c ( 386 galaxies ) . from these 1199 galaxies we pick out the ones with a relative error in the h@xmath2-flux less than @xmath3 .",
    "we have computed a large grid ( 5000 models ) of one - zone cems , testing time - scales for infall from @xmath4 gyr to @xmath5 gyr , baryon densities ranging between @xmath6 pc@xmath7 and @xmath8 pc@xmath7 , which should cover most of the possible variations within dwarf and late - type galaxies .",
    "star formation is prescribed by a simple schmidt - law , @xmath9 , where the constant @xmath10 is varied between @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , we have tried several power - law initial imfs @xmath13 in order to test the bottom - heavy imf hypothesis ( @xmath14 ) suggested by lee et al .",
    "the nucleosynthesis prescriptions are taken from chieffi & limongi ( 2004 ) for high mass stars and van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) for low and intermediate stars and all model tracks where evolved over 13.7 gyr ( one hubble - age )",

    "in fig . 1 we show a comparison between our abundances derived from spectral data from sdss - dr4 using the so - called p - method ( see , e.g. , pilyugin 2003 ) and our model results .",
    "clearly , the late - type lsbgs do not deviate from the general , rising trend found in hsb galaxies .",
    "based on the results from our model grid we draw the following conclusions : +   - the @xmath16-ratios in dwarf irregular and late - type lsbgs follow the same basic pattern as their hsb counterparts .",
    "+ - the chemical evolution , as revealed by the hii - regions , is not compatible with an extremely bottom - heavy imf as suggested by lee et al ( 2004 ) , nor is it compatible with a top - heavy imf .",
    "+ - the lsb property of these objects is most likely due to a low global star formation density , although the efficiency of star formation in star - forming regions must be as high as in hsbgs in order to explain the high @xmath15-ratios .",
    "+ - given these results , it is unlikely ( although not impossible ) that the ages of lsbgs are significantly different from the ages of corresponding hsbgs .",
