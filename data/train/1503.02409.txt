    "entanglement leads to physical effects unattainable for product states .",
    "one of the best known examples of such effects is multi - particle interference , which has been extensively studied in both the theoretical and experimental realms @xcite . in general",
    "these studies are within the framework of quantum optics",
    ". it would be interesting to consider similar schemes for massive particles .",
    "one natural candidate is the interaction of massive particles with light gratings . in particular , the kapitza - dirac effect ,",
    "proposed long ago @xcite , has been experimentally verified for atoms @xcite and electrons @xcite .",
    "we shall consider in this paper two - particle diffraction by light gratings with the particles entangled in momentum , showing the presence of two - particle interference effects absent for factorizable states .",
    "the arrangement reflects how the light - matter interaction is modified by entanglement .",
    "other examples of the dependence of the interaction on entanglement can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "similar interference effects have been already discussed for the other type of non - product states , the ( anti)symmetrized states of identical particles @xcite . in the case of",
    "single - mode states our work bears many mathematical resemblances to that paper , but here we shall consider some aspects of the problem not discussed there .",
    "we shall show the existence of a discontinuity in the set of joint detection distributions when the two momenta are equal .",
    "this property reflects the discontinuous nature of the space of entangled states .    for multi - mode states our approach departs from the elementary qualitative treatment given in @xcite .",
    "here , we consider entangled gaussian states and we can derive exact analytical expressions for the joint detection patterns .",
    "these patterns , corresponding to the sum of a large number of gaussian terms , can accurately be described by a single gaussian .",
    "the main physical novelty in the multi - mode case occurs for identical particles .",
    "then we can observe at work three quantum processes ( diffraction and exchange and entanglement effects ) at once .",
    "our first finding in this scenario is the existence of a type of complementarity between overlapping ( the variable ruling the intensity of the exchange interaction ) and entanglement degree .",
    "when one of them increases the other must decrease . to evaluate the entanglement degree we use the schmidt number @xcite , which is a measure well - suited for continuous variable problems .",
    "another consequence of the physical connection between particle identity and entanglement is the cancellation of the exchange effects for symmetric entangled states .",
    "we consider in this section single - mode states .",
    "first we describe the arrangement and the equations describing the light - matter interaction . in the second subsection",
    "we derive the interference patterns in the position representation .",
    "finally , we discuss the singular behavior of the system when the initial momenta are equal .",
    "a sketch of the arrangement can be seen in fig .",
    "a source generates pairs of particles in entangled states .",
    "each particle interacts with a light grating .",
    "the gratings , two standing light waves formed by counter - propagating lasers with different wavelengths , are denoted as @xmath0 and @xmath1 . after the gratings we place detectors working in coincidence to determine the joint probabilities .",
    "the only relevant variables in the problem are those parallel to the grating @xcite , reducing the description of the system to a two - dimensional one ( one variable for each particle ) .",
    "the initial entangled state in momentum is    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the longitudinal momenta of the particles and the subscripts @xmath0 and @xmath1 refer to the grating with which they interact .",
    "next , we must describe the interaction of the particles with the gratings",
    ". the process is ruled by the lightshift potential @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the wavenumber of the laser light and @xmath7 the spatial coordinate in the direction parallel to the grating @xcite .",
    "we assume that the potential intensity is the same in both sides but the laser wavenumbers , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , differ . in the diffraction regime of the kapitza - dirac effect",
    "the raman - nath approximation , neglecting the kinetic part of the motion , holds @xcite .",
    "then , as the initial wave function for the mode @xmath3 in the position representation is @xmath10 , the wave function after the interaction will be @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the interaction time .",
    "the exponential can be rewritten using the expression @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the bessel function of order @xmath15 . using simple trigonometric relations we obtain @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .     and",
    "@xmath19.,width=340,height=226 ]    returning to the momentum picture this evolution can be expressed as @xmath20 .",
    "the final state of the complete system is @xmath21 from this expression we can derive the joint detection probabilities .",
    "the probability of measuring the system in the state @xmath22 is @xmath23 where we have used the orthogonality of the momentum states @xmath24 .",
    "the above expression must be interpreted in terms of distributions where , for instance , @xmath25 .",
    "when the two conditions @xmath26 and @xmath27 simultaneously hold for some values of @xmath15 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 we have interference effects . in effect , when these conditions are not fulfilled , @xmath31 , the detection probability is @xmath32 with no interference effects .",
    "in contrast , when the conditions hold the probability becomes @xmath33 the third term on the r. h. s. corresponds to the interference term between the alternatives ( i ) @xmath15 photon absorptions in l and @xmath28 in r , and ( ii ) @xmath29 absorptions in l and @xmath30 in r. the indistinguishability of both alternatives implies that their probability amplitudes must add , giving rise to interference effects .",
    "we note that , for given @xmath8 and @xmath9 , only in some cases we have interference effects .",
    "the two above conditions lead to the relation @xmath34 that can be only fulfilled when @xmath35 is a rational number as , for instance , in the case @xmath36 . on the other hand , for each pair of values @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( with the exception of , see later , @xmath37 ) there are always pairs of laser wavevectors showing interference .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 there are interference effects for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .      in the position representation",
    "the initial entangled state is @xmath43 , with @xmath7 and @xmath44 the longitudinal spatial variables of the two particles .",
    "after the interaction this expression becomes    @xmath45    with @xmath46 and a similar expression for @xmath47 . the final two - particle detection probability , @xmath48 , is @xmath49 with @xmath50 the probability of the product state corresponding to a mixture of the initial product states @xmath51 and @xmath52 with equal weights @xmath53 .",
    "the second term on the r. h. s. of this equation represents the two - particle interference effects , with the typical dependence on trigonometric functions of @xmath54 . at variance with momentum interference",
    "there are no constraints between the values of @xmath55 and the @xmath56 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the spatial interference contains all the possible numbers of photon interchanges ( all the @xmath56 ) through @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , there is spatial interference for any value of the ratio @xmath35 .",
    "the above properties show the different qualitative behavior of interference in the position and momentum representations for the same initial entangled states .",
    "the interference effects discussed in this subsection and the previous one are mathematically similar to those in @xcite for identical particles . in that paper",
    "they were considered in detail and we shall not continue here that line of argumentation , which can be easily translated to our problem .",
    "instead , we shall analyze another physical aspect of the problem that was not treated there , the existence of a discontinuity .",
    "let us consider the particular case @xmath37 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cua ] ) and ( [ eq : cin ] ) , the conditions for the existence of interference effects . in this case",
    "the effects only exist for @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "however , the resultant patterns can not be considered as genuine two - particle interference as the necessary condition to have interference is the existence of indistinguishable alternatives . when @xmath58 and @xmath59 there is only one alternative for photon absorption by the particles . in the case",
    "@xmath37 , at difference with the rest of values @xmath60 , there is not two - particle interference .",
    "we obtain the same conclusion , in a little bit more intuitive way , in the position representation .",
    "for instance , in the particular case @xmath61 , the joint detection probability becomes @xmath62 when the two momenta are equal the dependence on @xmath54 , characteristic of the spatial two - particle interference , vanishes .",
    "this behavior can be understood in terms of the form of the initial state @xmath63 , which transforms for @xmath37 into @xmath64 that is a product state instead of an entangled one . moreover , the normalization is incorrect : the normalized ( in the single - mode sense ) two - particle state is @xmath65 .",
    "we have a discontinuity in the set of entangled states . for any @xmath60 you have the entangled state @xmath63 .",
    "however , for @xmath37 there is not an entangled state .",
    "the structure of the space of entangled states ( with equal coefficients @xmath66 ) is not @xmath67 but @xmath68 .",
    "it is constituted by two disconnected parts separated by the line @xmath37 .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the general states @xmath69 instead of @xmath70 , with @xmath71 the bloch sphere .",
    "this mathematical discontinuity translates into a physical discontinuity . if we evaluate the joint probability as the limit @xmath72 within the space of entangled states we have @xmath73 .",
    "this is the joint detection pattern for entangled momenta with @xmath74 ( although @xmath75 ) .",
    "it doubles at any point the pattern @xmath76 of a product state .",
    "consequently we have a discontinuity for equal values of the momenta . in its vicinity",
    "we have joint patterns with sharply different values .",
    "the transition between entangled and product states is not continuous .",
    "we consider in this section the multi - mode case . in order to deal with analytical expressions",
    "we only consider gaussian states , which have been extensively used in the literature ( see @xcite for non - gaussian situations ) .",
    "the unnormalized initial state is @xmath77 the coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote the spread of each exponential .    when @xmath80 the above state is entangled .",
    "a good measure of the entanglement degree for continuous variable systems is the schmidt number @xcite . for our problem",
    "it can be easily evaluated analytically when @xmath81 , giving @xmath82 .",
    "the system is entangled when @xmath83 .",
    "the unnormalized wave function after the interaction , @xmath84 , is evaluated using two times the fourier transform ( we omit some constant coefficients ) @xmath85 the normalized wave function is @xmath86 , with @xmath87 the normalization factor . it can be explicitly evaluated when @xmath88 and is given by @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 .     in arbitrary units versus @xmath4 in units @xmath92 .",
    "the black , red and blue curves correspond respectively to @xmath93 and @xmath94.,width=264,height=264 ]    we give next a graphical presentation of the detection patterns associated with these equations .",
    "we take as momentum unity @xmath92 . in addition",
    ", we use the values @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in order to see the variation of the patterns with the entanglement degree we consider three different values of @xmath79 : @xmath98 and @xmath94 that correspond to a product and two entangled initial states .",
    "we represent in fig .",
    "2 the two - particle detection pattern for @xmath99 , @xmath100 . in the evaluation",
    "we only consider the terms @xmath101 .",
    "we have that in the three cases the sum of multiple gaussian terms ( the terms in eq.([eq : onc ] ) ) reduces in a very good approximation to a single effective gaussian distribution : @xmath102 , with the values @xmath103 for @xmath104 , and @xmath105 for all the @xmath106 .",
    "note that these single distributions are not normalized ( the normalization is only for the sum over @xmath3 of all the @xmath107 ) .",
    "@xmath108 is a measure of the width of the distribution .",
    "more physically it quantifies to how many ( @xmath109)-modes effectively affect the diffraction . in all the cases , for product states and for different degrees of entanglement ,",
    "it is equal . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath110 represents the intensity of the diffraction process for the affected modes .",
    "in contrast with @xmath108 , it depends on the entanglement degree . in our example",
    "it decreases for increasing schmidt s numbers . for other values of @xmath3 that behavior will be different ( the total probability for all",
    "the @xmath111 is the same in the three cases ) .",
    "we have also studied the form of the two - particle diffraction patterns in the position representation . for the sake of shortness we do not present the complete analysis here .",
    "we only signal that , as in the momentum representation , a single gaussian distribution fits well the multiple gaussian terms sum .",
    "in this section we study the multi - mode case when the two particles are identical .",
    "it is interesting because in addition to the interference and entanglement effects we must consider the exchange ones .",
    "the last effects are only relevant when the overlapping between the particles is large",
    ". then the two particles must be diffracted by the same light grating ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .",
    "first of all we must analyze the relation between entanglement degree and overlapping , the two measures that determine the intensity of the entanglement and exchange effects .",
    "the state of two identical particles ( described by the entangled state @xmath112 previous to the consideration of the identity conditions ) is obtained via the standard procedure of ( anti)symmetrization : @xmath113 with @xmath114 the overlapping of the two particles @xmath115    the last expression is valid for @xmath116 ( for instance , for the values used in the previous section ) . when this condition does not hold the overlapping can not be evaluated analytically . the signs",
    "@xmath117 and @xmath118 in @xmath119 refer respectively to bosons and fermions .",
    "through this paper we have not considered the spin ( or electronic ) part of the quantum state because it is not relevant in the diffraction dynamics . when the spin variables are taken into account",
    "the ( anti)symmetrization refers to the complete state and , for example , the spatial wave function of fermions can be symmetrized . by assuming that the two particles are in a symmetrized spin state , @xmath120 or @xmath121",
    ", we do not need to consider these cases here . with this choice",
    "the spatial part of the state must be symmetrized for bosons and antisymmetrized for fermions .",
    "the extension to antisymmetrized spin states is immediate .",
    "although there is some controversy on the characterization of entanglement in systems of identical particles , following the criterion in @xcite it is clear that @xmath122 is entangled .",
    "for instance , for fermions , the state is non - entangled if and only if @xmath122 is obtained by antisymmetrizing a factorized state @xcite .",
    "thus , for fermions ( [ eq : ghi ] ) represents an entangled state .",
    "moreover , in this approach one clearly sees that entanglement is associated with @xmath112 , the state that is ( anti)symmetrized . then it is natural to assume that the amount of entanglement in @xmath122 is the same of @xmath112 .",
    "as signaled in the previous section we use the schmidt number to quantify the entanglement contained in @xmath112 .",
    "two interesting conclusions can be easily obtained :    \\(i ) we fix @xmath123 and @xmath124 and vary @xmath79 over all the values showing entanglement , @xmath125 . when @xmath126 we have @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the overlapping is very small , whereas the entanglement tends to very high values . on the other hand , for @xmath129 these limits are @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "it is simple to see that this value of the overlapping is maximum .",
    "now the system tends to a factorized one whereas the overlapping is finite , reaching the maximum value compatible with @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we observe a complementary behavior .",
    "the entanglement is maximum when the overlapping is null and vice versa .",
    "\\(ii ) symmetric entangled states represent a special case in the relation between entanglement and overlapping . for symmetric entanglement ,",
    "@xmath132 , the overlapping reaches its maximum value @xmath133 independently of @xmath79 .",
    "this is so for any type of symmetric entangled state , @xmath134 , because @xmath135 is due to the normalization . for symmetric entangled states we have maximum overlapping regardless of the particular entanglement degree of the state .",
    "in addition , symmetric states have another relevant property .",
    "when we take @xmath112 symmetric @xmath122 is undefined ( it has the form @xmath136 ) for fermions .",
    "no pair of fermions can be prepared in a symmetric entangled state ( with our choice of the spin part ) , a property that can be seen as a natural extension of pauli s exclusion principle from product to non - factorizable states . in effect ,",
    "when the state is a product one , @xmath137 , the symmetry condition implies @xmath138 , a relation that is forbidden by pauli s exclusion principle .    on the other hand , for bosons",
    ", we have @xmath139 that corresponds to a state without symmetrization ( in the sense of symmetrization for identical particles ) .",
    "the exchange effects vanish : in the presence of symmetric entanglement there are not exchange effects in two - boson systems .",
    "this result confirms a previous analysis in @xcite , where a similar behavior in the position representation was found for pairs of non - entangled identical bosons in a two - slit arrangement : in the cases where the overlapping between the two bosons is large ( it is increased by the diffraction process to values close to unity ) the two - boson diffraction pattern is indistinguishable from that of a product state and does not show the typical characteristics associated with exchange effects .      after analyzing the relation between @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the initial state",
    "we evaluate the diffraction patterns . by similitude with eq .",
    "( [ eq : onc ] ) the final state is @xmath142 the calculation of the normalization factor @xmath143 is a little bit more involved than in the previous section . in @xmath144",
    "we have four terms , two direct and two crossed ones .",
    "the integration of each one of them over the full momentum space gives a contribution to the squared normalization factor .",
    "moreover , we must take into account that the crossed terms must be added to the direct ones in the case of bosons , but subtracted in that of fermions . for instance , the contribution of the first term is @xmath145 where @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this expression is valid when @xmath149 . for other values of the parameters an analytical expression",
    "can not be obtained .",
    "it is simple to see that the two direct ( d ) terms are equal , and the crossed ( c ) ones also .",
    "finally we have @xmath150 .",
    "@xmath151 is given by @xmath152 and @xmath153 by a similar expression with obvious modifications in the order of the coefficients @xmath154 .     and",
    "@xmath94 , whereas continuous and dashed ones represent respectively bosons and fermions.,width=340,height=264 ]    next , we represent these patterns . with the same values for @xmath123 and @xmath124 of fig .",
    "2 , @xmath155 and for the parameter @xmath79 the values @xmath156 ( negligible entanglement ) , @xmath94 ( small overlapping ) and @xmath157 ( intermediate case ) ( see fig .",
    "we observe a clear difference between bosons and fermions . in the first case",
    "the distribution is peaked around the point @xmath158 , whereas in the second this point is forbidden by pauli s exclusion principle . instead , we see a valley around this point with two peaks around .",
    "in addition to this general trend we see that the visibility ( difference between maximum and minimum values ) is strongly dependent on the entanglement degree of each curve .",
    "we have shown that entangled states are diffracted by a light grating in a different way than product ones .",
    "this is the essence of multi - particle interference . in an alternative view ,",
    "our results reflect the dependence of the light - matter interaction on the separability of the state . in our proposal one can easily visualize how the joint detection patterns change with the entanglement degree .",
    "the discontinuity found in the single - mode approximation provides , in principle , a method to experimentally study the disconnected character of the space of entangled states .",
    "it would be also interesting to test the cancellation of exchange effects by symmetric entanglement described above .",
    "this result , which corroborates previous findings for non - entangled states @xcite , suggests the existence of a rich and unexplored relation between entanglement and particle identity .",
    "for instance , the complementarity between overlapping and schmidt s number reflects a type of competition between both effects .    in this paper",
    "we have restricted our considerations to thin light gratings .",
    "for thick ones we move to the bragg regime of the kapitza - dirac effect .",
    "one expects to find similar effects to those described here , but this must be verified by an explicit calculation .",
    "we have not discussed the experimental realization of the proposal .",
    "as the diffraction regime of the kapitza - dirac effect has already been tested @xcite , we must concentrate on the sources of entangled particles for the arrangement . for two gratings , a decaying particle initially at rest ,",
    "seems to be a good candidate .",
    "the single - mode case can be approximated by restricting the two generated beams to some particular directions using collimators . for only one grating",
    ", the photodissociation of molecules traveling towards the standing light wave , looks to be a more adequate process than the decay of unstable particles .    in the case of electrons",
    "a nanotip source can be interesting .",
    "the antisymmetrization properties of such a source have been studied in @xcite .",
    "they lead to a dip in the joint detection probability .",
    "although the state of electrons appears to be entangled in momentum ( eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) in @xcite ) , it is not true entanglement : the state is obtained by ( anti)symmetrization of two - particle product states ( eqs .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 13 ) in @xcite ) and then , according to the criterion in @xcite , the entanglement is associated with the ( anti)symmetrization procedure . however , due to the coulomb interaction between the electrons , there can be true entanglement in the system . an extended analysis including",
    "that interaction would be necessary to evaluate the entanglement and to see the viability of an experimental test .",
