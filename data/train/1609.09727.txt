    "the spontaneous production of charged pairs in an electric field , the so - called schwinger effect,@xcite and the emission of all species of particles from a black hole , the so - called hawking radiation,@xcite are the two most prominent nonperturbative quantum effects . though the spectrum of radiation has been intensively investigated , the one - loop effective action has not been seriously studied yet .",
    "the in - out formalism by schwinger and dewitt provides a consistent and systematic theoretical framework to understand pair ( particle ) production and vacuum polarization.@xcite    the gamma - function regularization,@xcite in particular , could explicitly yield the one - loop qed effective action in the proper - time integral@xcite from the bogoliubov coefficient , which is expressed in terms of gamma functions .",
    "this method applies to the qed action in @xmath1.@xcite the near - horizon geometry of @xmath2 of a near - extremal reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole sheds light on the charge emission from the near - extremal black hole.@xcite the schwinger effect has been elaborated in @xmath3 and charged black holes.@xcite    in this paper , we explore the connection between the particle distribution of spontaneously produced pairs and the vacuum persistence , twice the imaginary part of one - loop effective action , and construct the one - loop action for the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "it is noted that the vacuum persistence for the bose - einstein ( fermi - dirac ) distribution corresponds to that qed action for fermions ( bosons ) . employing the phase - integral method",
    ", we compute the schwinger effect in the static coordinates of @xmath3 and rederive the hawking radiation of a non - extremal black hole and the schwinger effect of a near - extremal black hole .",
    "finally , we discuss the connection between the anomaly and the vacuum persistence .",
    "the particle or pair spontaneously created by an external electromagnetic field or black hole has the distribution @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes quantum numbers , and @xmath6 for fermions , @xmath7 for bosons and @xmath8 for boltzmann distribution .",
    "the parameter may be given by @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 is the spin of particles and @xmath11 for the boltzmann distribution , otherwise @xmath12 .",
    "in the in - out formalism , the vacuum persistence , twice of the imaginary part of the one - loop effective action , is related to the mean number of produced pairs of fermions and bosons as @xmath13 the summation implicitly includes the number of states as well as the sum over quantum numbers .",
    "the boltzmann distribution does have the vacuum persistence @xmath14 in qed the vacuum persistence ( [ b vac per ] ) is known as the nikishov representation.@xcite stephens noted that the vacuum persistence for the fd ( be ) distribution corresponds to that of bosons ( fermions ) in qed.@xcite on the other hand , the the vacuum persistence for the schwinger effect in a constant electric field could be expressed as an energy integral of the inverted spin statistics.@xcite the hawking radiation from black holes has either the fermi - dirac ( fd ) or bose - einstein ( be ) distribution while the schwinger effect due to a constant electric field in the minkowski spacetime has the boltzmann distribution.@xcite    a conjecture of reconstruction of the one - loop effective action from the distribution of the produced mean number has recently proposed by the author and schubert@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the principal value and the function @xmath17 makes the effective action finite and corresponds to the renormalization of the vacuum energy and charge in qed .",

    "the leading term of the mean number of the schwinger effect is given by the phase - integral @xmath31 in the complex plane @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "the leading terms of particles produced with quantum number @xmath34 in nonstatic coordinates have the form , @xmath35 , in the complex plane of time , where @xmath36 exhausts all possible independent contours of winding number one.@xcite the higher winding numbers @xmath37 will yield multi - pairs . in this paper",
    "we extend the geometric transition method for pair production to static coordinates of curved spacetimes @xmath38    the action ( [ ads ac ] ) in @xmath0 has two finite simple poles at @xmath39 and another pole at @xmath40 . the contour integral in fig .",
    "1 gives the mean number @xmath41 , where the instanton action is @xmath42 the first term comes from the two simple poles @xmath43 and the second term comes from another pole at @xmath40 . in the absence of electric field",
    "the residues at @xmath43 add up to zero and the residue from @xmath40 vanishes .",
    "the pure @xmath3 is thus stable against the production of particles unless an electric field acts .",
    "the effective temperature for the schwinger effect in @xmath0 has recently been introduced by cai and the author , which gives the physical interpretation @xmath44 with the unruh temperature @xmath45 .    ) of a charged scalar in a uniform electric field and @xmath0",
    "has a branch - cut in the complex plane @xmath32 and a pair of simple poles at @xmath46 and another simple pole at @xmath47 .",
    "the contour includes both poles at @xmath46 , and also receives a contribution from @xmath47.,width=240 ]    the action ( [ ads ac ] ) in @xmath21 has two finite simple poles at @xmath48 and another simple pole at @xmath40 .",
    "applying the phase - integral ( [ geom tr ] ) , we find the leading term for the schwinger effect @xmath49 the instanton has been found by the worldline instanton or the bogoliubov transformation.@xcite the analytical continuation from @xmath50 to @xmath51 holds only under the interaction of the electric field .",
    "the schwinger effect has also the thermal interpretation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the gibbons - hawking temperature .",
    "the schwinger effect in the global coordinates of @xmath1 differs that in the static coordinates . in the global coordinates of @xmath0 @xmath54",
    "the schwinger effect is given by@xcite @xmath55 on the other hand , the schwinger effect in the global coordinates of @xmath21 takes the form @xmath56 note that the instanton action ( [ ads in ] ) is @xmath57 and that ( [ ds in ] ) is @xmath58 . in ref .",
    "the phase - integral recovers the numerator and the leading term of the denominator . note also that the leading term of the schwinger effect is the same both in the static coordinates and in the global coordinates .",
    "the charged rn black hole with mass @xmath59 and charge @xmath60 has the metric @xmath61 where @xmath62 note that particles are mostly emitted from the near - horizon region and the tunneling picture gives a physical interpretation of the hawking radiation from there.@xcite the near - horizon geometry of a non - extremal black hole has the geometry , @xmath63 , while that of an extremal black hole has another geometry , @xmath2 .",
    "so the charge emission of the near - extremal black hole should be distinguished from that of the non - extremal black hole .",
    "first , the metric for a non - extremal charged black hole can be written as the rindler space@xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 here , @xmath34 is the surface gravity @xmath66 contrary to the @xmath1 in an electric field , the action ( [ ads ac ] ) for a charged scalar has a single finite simple pole at @xmath67 with the residue @xmath68 . employing the phase - integral and counting all winding numbers , we may obtain the hawking radiation @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the inverse hawking temperature and @xmath71 is the electric potential on the horizon .",
    "this implies that the bose - einstein distribution of produced particles is a consequence of a single finite simple pole .",
    "we may guess that the phase - integral for fermions should have an addition factor @xmath72 to guarantee the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the gray factor may be related to the contribution from the infinity .",
    "we may magnify the near - horizon region of a near - extremal black hole and write the geometry @xmath2 as@xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 measures the deviation from the extremal black hole and the radial coordinate is stretched as @xmath75 while the time coordinate is squeezed as @xmath76 .",
    "the squeezing of time does not affect the method due to the time - translational symmetry of the static nature .",
    "the action ( [ ads ac ] ) for the @xmath77-wave gives the leading term@xcite @xmath78 note that @xmath79 and @xmath80 on the horizon , so @xmath81 for @xmath0 . the action ( [ ex bh ] ) is equivalent to the action ( [ ads in ] ) .",
    "the effective temperature for the schwinger effect@xcite gives a simple thermal interpretation @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the unruh temperature , the effective temperature and mass ( [ ads tem ] ) with @xmath86 on the horizon .",
    "the exact rates of charged boson and fermion emission from a near - extremal rn black hole have been explicitly studied in refs . and and",
    "the charge emission from a near - extremal kerr - newman black hole has recently been found in ref . .",
    "a thermal interpretation of the schwinger emission of charged bosons and fermions has been advanced in refs . and .",
    "in the framework of quantum field theory we have critically reviewed the hawking radiation as well as the schwinger effect in @xmath1 and a charged rn black hole .",
    "the quantum field theory should be able to properly include the effect of pair production in electromagnetic fields or black holes or de sitter space since the vacuum there becomes unstable against the spontaneous emission of pairs ( particles ) .",
    "the in - out formalism provides a consistent and comprehensive field theory at the one - loop or higher loops to study not only the vacuum polarization ( real part of the effective action ) but also the vacuum persistence ( imaginary part ) .",
    "the one - loop effective action and the vacuum persistence exposed in this paper thus may shed light on understanding the hawking radiation from a black hole and the schwinger effect due an electric field .",
    "a charged black hole is a very interesting arena to probe the vacuum structure and to comprehend the intertwinement of quantum gravity and qed effects simultaneously .",
    "the physical implications of the vacuum persistence have not been exploited in this paper .",
    "ritus has proposed an interpretation in qed that the vacuum persistence ( [ b vac per ] ) is the pressure of the fermion or boson gas.@xcite the fact that the vacuum persistence for fermion production is greater than that for boson production modulo the spin - multiplicity is consistent with the repulsive nature of fermions and the attractive nature of bosons .",
    "another interesting aspect of nonperturbative quantum effect is anomalies . in qed",
    "the vacuum persistence is related to the imaginary part of the trace anomaly.@xcite the hawking radiation is related to the trace anomaly.@xcite the vacuum persistence for the hawking radiation is the gravitational anomalies.@xcite it would be an interesting open question to show whether the vacuum persistence in @xmath87 and extremal black hole is related to the trace anomaly .    the schwinger effect in @xmath87 has been given a thermal interpretation with respect to the effective temperature associated with the acceleration of charges in the electric field.@xcite it results from the solution of the field equation or the instanton action via the phase - integral method .",
    "the unruh effect has been investigated in @xmath87 , in which the effective temperature is the geometric mean of the unruh temperature and the gibbons - hawking temperature in @xmath88 or the scalar curvature in @xmath3.@xcite the acceleration of charge by an electric field in @xmath87 and charged black hole is determined by @xmath89 and gives the unruh temperature .",
    "one may be tempted to expect the effective temperature similar to the unruh effect in @xmath87 .",
    "the effective temperature , however , involves an intrinsic nature as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ ads tem ] ) and ( [ ds tem ] ) .",
    "the worldline instanton in the embedding spacetime gives the same result as the phase - integral.@xcite in the minkowski limit , the effective temperature is twice of the unruh temperature for the accelerating charge in the electric field .",
