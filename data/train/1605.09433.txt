    ".    the system will be regular hyperbolic if the reciprocal effective metric satisfies some algebraic conditions .",
    "an inescapable ( necessary ) condition for the system to be well - posed is that @xmath102 constitutes a non - degenerate semi - definite tensor field with a lorentzian signature .",

    "as we are mainly interested in wave propagation about these solutions , we assume henceforth that @xmath102 is lorentzian .",

    "accordingly , in order to analyze the causal replacement of our model , we recall the notion of characteristics .",
    "physically , they can be identified with the infinite - momentum limit of the _ eikonal _ approximation @xcite ( or , equivalently , with the surfaces of discontinuity obtained via hadamard s method ) .",

    "thus , the resulting algebraic variety is always given by a product of quadrics , one of which changes from point to point in a way completely prescribed by the background solution @xmath119 and the nonlinearities present in the nicole model ( @xmath120 ) .",

    "thus , the model supports two types of waves : one is governed by the background metric @xmath104 while the other is governed by the _ effective metric _ @xmath129 .",

    "@xmath122 ( see , however , @xcite for a case where this property fails ) .",
    "conversely , we are led to investigate spacetime trajectories such that the _ effective line element _ vanishes , i.e. @xmath134 interestingly , if the map ( [ mapping ] ) is independent of time , the problem of finding null geodesics in the effective space - time reduces to that of finding geodesics in an effective riemannian manifold of lower dimension . indeed , choosing a coordinate system @xmath135 , @xmath136 , such that @xmath137 and @xmath138 one reduces ( [ effgeo ] ) and ( [ effconst ] ) to the equations @xmath139 @xmath140 with @xmath141 and",
