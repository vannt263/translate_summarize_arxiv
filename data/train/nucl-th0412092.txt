    "in a hot dense plasma short - lived excited states of the nucleus with excitation energies on the order of the temperature of the plasma reach thermal equilibrium with the nuclear ground state and their relative population is determined by a boltzmann distribution .",
    "nucleosynthesis calculations usually try to take these states into account , though little is known about their nucleonic reaction properties ( see , for example , ref@xcite ) .",
    "recently there has been increased interest in the reaction properties of a certain set of nuclear excited states : nuclear spin isomers .",
    "these isomers are characterized by their relative long lifetimes due to their large angular momentum compared to their respective ground states .",
    "particular interest has been concentrated on the 77 ev isomer of @xmath0u , where studies suggest that this isomer is populated strongly in the @xmath6 reaction as well as in the @xmath7u@xmath8 reaction , and that the fission and neutron capture cross sections for this isomer are significantly different than that of the @xmath0u ground state@xcite .",
    "thus , in high neutron flux environments , where two- or multi - neutron reactions are highly probable , reactions on this isomer can affect the reaction network chain involving the uranium isotopes .",
    "the question we wish to address here is whether nuclear isomers can be populated by electromagnetic interactions as well . in a hot dense plasma environment",
    "there are several electromagnetic mechanisms to be considered at leading and sub - leading order in the fine structure constant @xmath9 , namely : photo - absorption , inverse internal conversion , inelastic electron scattering , coulomb excitation , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is _ inverse _ internal pair - production .",
    "the threshold for this reaction occurs at @xmath10 mev ( twice the electron mass ) , where @xmath11 is the excitation energy of the isomer .",
    "however , for the isomers considered here , this condition is not met .",
    "see ref.@xcite for descriptions of higher order processes . ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the feynman diagrams for these processes .",
    "the electromagnetic excitation rates for all of these processes depend , of course , on the temperature @xmath12 of the plasma , the excitation energy @xmath13 of the isomer , and the lifetime @xmath14 of the isomer . to simplify calculations",
    ", we assume that nuclei are completely stripped of their electrons in the plasma . where possible , we give estimates to the errors of this assumption .",
    "we present expressions for these electromagnetic processes and examine the rates for certain nuclear isomers . of particular interest for applied",
    "physics are the low - lying isomers of @xmath0u , @xmath1ir , @xmath2y .",
    "their properties , as well as those of other isomers considered in this paper , are listed in table  [ tab : isomers ] .",
    "the half - lives of these isomers range from 0.3 msec to years and their excitation energies from @xmath15 ev - @xmath16 mev .",
    "the total reaction width can be expressed as the sum of its constituent widths : @xmath17 traditionally , this width is expressed as @xmath18 here @xmath19 refers to internal conversion , @xmath20 refers to inelastic electron scattering , and so forth . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : width_sum ] ) , calculation of a particular channel width @xmath21 involves calculating both @xmath22 and @xmath23,where @xmath24 for the case of photo - absorption .",
    "the reaction rate per nucleon for a particular channel @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the flux of incoming particles responsible for that particular reaction and @xmath28 is the cross section . due to the relatively long lifetimes of these isomers (",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath29 ) , the cross section is well approximated by @xmath30 where @xmath13 is the excitation energy of the isomer and @xmath31 is the wavenumber for the incoming particle .",
    "we assume that in the system of interest the plasma has reached thermal equilibrium so that the photon flux is described by a plankian distribution , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the photon number density in the energy window between @xmath11 and @xmath34 .",
    "the photo - absorption rate per unit atom is then @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the photo - absorption cross section . equation  [ eqn : r_gamma gamma ] follows from substituting eq .",
    "[ eqn : bw_approx ] into eq .",
    "[ eqn : r_gamma ] . in the long - wavelength approximation ( which is valid for the plasma conditions considered here )",
    "the width @xmath37 can be expressed in terms of reduced multipolarity transition probabilities @xmath38 , @xmath39 ^ 2 } \\left(\\frac{e_m}{\\hbar      c}\\right)^{2\\lambda+1}b(\\pi\\lambda : j_i\\rightarrow j_f)\\ ] ] in general , calculating @xmath38 is very difficult because it depends on the initial- and final - state nuclear wavefunctions , which are not typically known .",
    "naive estimates can be made if one invokes the extreme single - particle approximation , giving the well - documented _ weisskopf _ expressions , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the bohr magneton . near closed - shell nuclei ,",
    "weisskopf estimates give reasonable agreement with experimental values .",
    "however , for nuclei that exhibit strong collective degrees of freedom , the weisskopf estimates are too small , sometimes by a few orders of magnitude@xcite .    since the half - life of the isomer of @xmath0u is about 26 minutes , temperatures of @xmath43 kev would be required for the reaction rate per unit atom to reach a value of one - per - second .",
    "thus , photo - absorption does not provide a significant mechanism for populating the 77 ev isomer of @xmath0u . as can be seen from table  [ tab : rates ] ,",
    "the photo - absorption rates for all the isomers considered here are negligible . even with more accurate weisskopf values",
    ", the photo - absorption rates of these isomers at these temperatures would still be very small .      in inverse internal conversion",
    "an electron from the plasma is captured into a bound atomic orbital , thereby exciting the nucleus .",
    "the capture energy of the electron must match the excitation energy of the nuclear isomer .",
    "the reaction rate is determined by the overlap of the continuum electron wavefunction with the bound atomic electron wavefunction , weighted by the nuclear transition matrix element .",
    "since we assume that nuclei are stripped of all their electrons , all atomic shells ( _ i.e. _ @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , etc ) can participate in the internal conversion process , as long as the kinematics of the process are satisfied .",
    "however , since the conversion happens near the nucleus , s - waves states typically dominate the transition . in most cases",
    "the electron can capture into the @xmath48 @xmath44-shell . for isomers with very low excitation energies",
    "the electron can be captured only into a higher orbit .",
    "for example , the 77 ev isomer of @xmath0u can capture electrons only into very high @xmath49 outer atomic orbits , whereas both @xmath50am and @xmath1ir can capture electrons only into orbits with @xmath51 .    to obtain naive estimates of @xmath52 , we assume relativistic hydrogenic wavefunctions for the bound electron and treat the nucleus as a point particle .",
    "the internal conversion coefficients for the innermost atomic orbits are thus given by@xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the photon wave number . for @xmath56 transitions",
    ", @xmath57 can take on values of @xmath58 or @xmath59 , while for @xmath60 transitions , @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "the functions @xmath63 are given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 here @xmath66 and @xmath67 correspond to the large and small components of the relativistic radial wavefunction for the bound electron in a coulombic field , while @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the corresponding analogues for the coulomb - distorted continuum wavefunction , and @xmath70 is the spherical hankel function of order @xmath71 .",
    "closed analytic forms can be derived for these integrals and are given , for example , in refs.@xcite .",
    "internal conversion coefficients for the innermost s - wave reactions are given in table  [ tab : iiccoefficients ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that though internal conversion is suppressed by an order @xmath9 compared to photo - absorption , there can be instances where there are enhancements to the reaction rate .",
    "this is clearly evident in @xmath1ir , @xmath50am , and especially @xmath0u .",
    "this behavior , though not apparent from eq .",
    "[ eqn : alphaiic ] , comes from the observation that the coefficients scale roughly as@xcite @xmath72 since the excitation energies of these isomers are relatively small , this enhancement is not surprising .    in the systems of interest ( _ e.g.",
    "_ ignited inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) capsules , nuclear explosions , and stellar environments ) , the temperatures attainable by the plasma are typically not high enough for nuclei to be completely stripped of their electrons , so that not all atomic shells are accessible for inverse internal conversion .",
    "screening effects arising from the partial stripping of these nuclei affect the isomer excitation reaction rates by as much as 50% or more , and for most of the isomers considered here , their excitation energies prohibit this excitation channel . ] .",
    "self - consistent dirac - hartree - fock calculations@xcite have been performed to obtain internal conversion coefficients on some of the isomers considered here .",
    "these calculations include the full effects of screening since the nuclei are not considered stripped of their electrons .",
    "finite - size effects of the nucleus are considered as well .",
    "hence these calculations use more realistic electronic wavefunctions than the simplistic hydrogenic wavefunctions considered here .",
    "we list these results in table  [ tab : iiccoefficients ] for comparison . in general",
    ", calculations can differ by an order of magnitude ( or more ) , as is evident for the case of @xmath73y . yet",
    "the overall trend in relative sizes is consistent between the two methods .",
    "the density of electrons is given by @xmath74 since there is no simple closed expression for the integral above , the chemical potential @xmath75 and density must be numerically solved self - consistently .",
    "the flux @xmath76 of electrons is simply @xmath77 hence the differential flux is @xmath78 using eqs .",
    "[ eqn : rate]-[eqn : bw_approx ] gives the rate for isomeric production via internal conversion as @xmath79    to obtain estimates , we take an average electron density of @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is avogadro s number .",
    "this corresponds to a chemical potential of @xmath82 kev ( @xmath83 kev ) at @xmath84 kev ( @xmath85 kev ) .",
    "rates are listed in table  [ tab : rates ] .",
    "even with the more accurate internal conversion coefficients of ref.@xcite , rates would still be negligible .",
    "formally , there is little difference between the theory of inelastic electron scattering and internal conversion .",
    "physically , the main difference is that the final state electron still belongs to the continuum , as opposed to the bound - state orbital characteristic of inverse internal conversion . if the point - nucleus approximation is made , calculations of ` inelastic scattering coefficients ' are identical to the case with internal conversion coefficients  one just replaces the bound state wavefunctions with coulomb distorted continuum wavefunctions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath86 the above integrals can be computed numerically and the coefficients calculated using eq .",
    "[ eqn : alphaiic ] .",
    "note that since these calculations deal with initial- and final - state _ continuum _ wavefunctions , coefficients no longer have any dependence on principal quantum numbers @xmath87 . nor",
    "do they take on discrete values since they are now functions of the electron s initial energy @xmath11 , which is continuous . since we approximate the reaction rate as being strongly peaked at the isomer s excitation energy ( _ i.e. _ eq .  [ eqn : bw_approx ] )",
    ", the reaction rate is simply @xmath88",
    "lastly , we assume the outgoing electron to be in an s - wave state .",
    "table  [ tab : iiccoefficients ] tabulates the inelastic scattering coefficients at each isomer s excitation energy @xmath13 .",
    "table  [ tab : rates ] shows rates for this reaction channel using the same conditions for the electron flux as in the previous section .",
    "isomeric excitation could also happen via heavy - ion coulomb excitation .",
    "in this case , the kinetic energy of the ions is small compared to its rest mass .",
    "hence the ions can be treated non - relativistically .",
    "reaction rates for heavy - ion coulomb excitations can be directly calculated using similar methods discussed in the previous sections .",
    "however , it is simpler ( and perhaps more enlightening ) to consider the ` adiabaticity ' parameter@xcite @xmath89 where @xmath11 is the incoming ion energy and @xmath90 is the classical sommerfeld number given by @xmath91 here @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the charges of the two scattering ions .",
    "the parameter @xmath94 is a measure of the ratio between the collision time and the nuclear period .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath94 , the more adiabatic the process becomes . under conditions where the reaction is highly adiabatic , excitation of the nucleus",
    "is unlikely due to the fact that the nucleus has time to equilibrate under the influence of the external coulomb field .",
    "assuming the ions are in thermal equilibrium , the energy @xmath11 can be approximated by @xmath95 .",
    "considering like - ion scattering , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath96 , the range of temperatures considered in this paper give @xmath97 the cross section for heavy - ion scattering scales roughly as @xmath98@xcite , which in turn gives a similar scaling for the reaction rate .",
    "this rate is extremely small for large @xmath94 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the exponential suppression is primarily a property of the _ repulsive _ coulomb field@xcite .",
    "the coulomb barrier of these ions is too strong at these plasma temperatures for any isomeric excitation . for an attractive field with @xmath99 ( as in inelastic electron scattering ) , this exponential behavior is not as pronounced .",
    "another possible excitation process is through excitation to some high lying state , followed by gamma decay to the isomer .",
    "excitation can be done via all the processes mentioned above , and in particular through ( @xmath100,@xmath101 ) and ( @xmath102,@xmath103 ) reactions . if one assumes that the rate of decay to the isomer is fast compared to the excitation process , then the rate of producing the isomer is approximately equal to the rate of excitation to the high - lying state . at first glance ,",
    "such a process might seem plausible , since many of these higher - lying states are connected to the ground state by transitions of low multipolarity ( @xmath1043,4 ) .",
    "such probability transitions may be larger by an order of magnitude or so compared to the isomeric transitions .",
    "however , the fluence of incoming particles with the necessary energy to allow excitation is exponentially suppressed .",
    "hence the gain from going to a lower multipolarity transition is quickly lost due to the fact that these high - lying states have large excitation energies compared to the isomers .    for example , consider the case of @xmath105 .",
    "the isomer state is connected via m1 transition to the @xmath106 state at energy 2529.87 kev .",
    "the transition probability between these two states is large ( @xmath14=.08 ps ) .",
    "the @xmath106 state can be connected to the ground state via an m3 transition .",
    "but since the energy of this high lying state is large compared to the isomer , the rate of populating this state is much smaller than for the rate of directly populating the isomer . this suppression is roughly @xmath107 here @xmath12 is in units of kev and @xmath108 is the rate for producing the isomer directly from the ground state ( via m4 transition ) . for a plasma temperature of 1 kev/10 kev ,",
    "this suppression factor is vanishingly small .",
    "similar suppression factors are found for the other isomers considered in this paper .",
    "hence we conclude that population of isomers via @xmath3 or @xmath4 excitation is extremely unlikely ( as opposed to the case of neutron - induced excitations , for example ) .",
    "nuclear isomers have played an increasingly important role in both astrophysics and applied physics phenemona . typically these isomers are assumed to be populated solely by strong nuclear reactions .",
    "however , if the temperatures of the environment in which the isomers exist are high enough , there is the possibility that they be populated electromagnetically as well . in this paper",
    "we addressed this latter issue for typical plasma temperatures found in mundane laboratories and astrophysical environments ( _ i.e. _ kt@xmath109 1 to 10 kev ) .    in sect .",
    "[ rates ] we gave expressions for the reaction rates of the following electromagnetic processes : photo - absorption , inverse internal conversion , inelastic electron scattering , and coulomb excitation . in sect .",
    "[ ngamma ] we argued that rates for @xmath3 and @xmath4 excitation were negligible .",
    "we made the assumption that the nucleus was a point particle and was completely stripped of its electrons due to the plasma environment .",
    "furthermore , we only considered s - wave scattering since this is usually the dominant channel .",
    "we found that all these processes contributed negligibly to the overall reaction rates for populating the nuclear isomers listed in table  [ tab : isomers ] .",
    "table  [ tab : rates ] summarizes our claims .",
    "these small rates can also be understood from simple dimensional analysis . as an example , consider photo - absorption on the ground state of @xmath0u .",
    "using eqns .",
    "[ eqn : r_gamma gamma]-[eqn : weisskopf estimates ] as guides , naive dimensional analysis gives the reaction rate for producing uranium isomers as @xmath110 where in this case @xmath111=3 and @xmath112 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath113 sets the scale of the transition .",
    "similar expressions for internal conversion and electron scattering can be determined from dimensional analysis as well , though in these cases it is the electron s momentum that determines the size of @xmath113 and not the photon s momentum . in all of these cases , @xmath113 is very small",
    ". an exception would be coulomb excitation .",
    "however , as already mentioned in sect .",
    "[ ce ] , the coulomb barrier is prohibitive at the temperatures considered here .",
    "clearly the assumption that the nucleus is completely stripped of electrons is not valid .",
    "furthermore , the expressions given in sect .",
    "[ rates ] were made under the assumption that the fluence of incoming particles is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this is most likely not true in applied physics applications .",
    "however , due to the extremely small rates listed in table  [ tab : rates ] , more sophisticated calculations that take these issues into consideration are not warranted .",
