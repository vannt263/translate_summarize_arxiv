    "renormalization group theory ( rgt ) for thermodynamic phase transitions @xcite and the edwards - anderson model for ising spin glasses ( isgs ) @xcite were introduced almost simultaneously forty years ago . ever since it has been tacitly assumed as self - evident that the standard rgt universality rules should apply to isgs .",
    "as far as we know there is no rigorous theoretical proof that this isg hypothesis holds , though confirmations have been reported a number of times based on numerical data @xcite .",
    "the universality principle states that for all systems within a universality class the critical exponents are strictly identical and do not depend on the microscopic parameters of the model .",
    "all isg models in a given dimension are supposed to be in the same universality class , on the assumption that the form of the interaction distribution is an irrelevant microscopic parameter .",
    "thus in the family of simple ferromagnets , within a universality class of models having space dimension @xmath0 and spin dimensionality @xmath1 , all models have identical critical properties corresponding to an isolated fixed point in the renormalisation group flow .",
    "however , diluted ferromagnets of given @xmath2 have a different ( dilution independent ) set of critical exponents , with values which correspond to a separate isolated fixed point @xcite . for a few special cases of spin models in dimension two ( discussed for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the critical behavior is more complicated and corresponds to a line of fixed points rather than an isolated fixed point ; critical parameters vary continuously according to motion along the line , produced by a marginal operator . from the empirical isg data below there",
    "appear for the moment to be two possible scenarios : two classes of isgs ( such as models with continuous distributions and those with discrete distributions ) or alternatively isg exponents which vary continuously with a parameter such as the kurtosis of the interaction distribution . in any case",
    "it has been stated by authoritative authors that classical tools of rgt analysis are not suitable for spin glasses @xcite although no explicit theoretical predictions have been made so far concerning the important question of universality .    here",
    "we combine numerical simulation and high temperature series expansion ( htse ) data on the bimodal and gaussian isgs in dimension four so as to obtain accurate and reliable values for the critical parameters in this model .",
    "we discuss a number of different methods for exploiting numerical data , and show that for each model these are consistent . comparisons between these and other estimates on isg models in the same dimension but with different interaction distributions show that the critical exponents and the critical constants for dimensionless parameters depend on the form of the interaction distribution .",
    "the hamiltonian is as usual @xmath3 with the near neighbor symmetric distributions normalized to @xmath4 .",
    "the ising spins live on simple hyper - cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have studied the bimodal model with a @xmath5 interaction distribution and the gaussian interaction distribution model .",
    "we will compare with published measurements on these and other @xmath6d isgs .",
    "we will use the inverse temperature @xmath7 , with the normalization above , or alternatively @xmath8 , to signify the temperature .",
    "the spin overlap parameter is defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 indicate two copies of the same system and @xmath12 is the number of sites .",
    "the simulations were carried out using the exchange monte carlo method for equilibration using so called multi - spin coding , on @xmath13 ( up to @xmath14 ) or @xmath15 ( for larger @xmath16 ) individual samples at each size .",
    "an exchange was attempted after every sweep with a success rate of at least 30% .",
    "at least 40 temperatures were used forming a geometric progression reaching down to @xmath17 for the bimodal model and @xmath18 for the gaussian model .",
    "this ensures that our data span the critical temperature region which is essential for the fss fits .",
    "near the critical temperature the @xmath19 step length was at most @xmath20 .",
    "the various systems were deemed to have reached equilibrium when the sample average susceptibility for the lowest temperature showed no trend between runs .",
    "for example , for @xmath21 this means about @xmath22 sweep - exchange steps .",
    "after equilibration , at least @xmath22 measurements were made for each sample for all sizes , taking place after every sweep - exchange step .",
    "data were registered for the energy @xmath23 , the correlation length @xmath24 , and for the spin overlap moments .",
    "in addition the correlations @xmath25 between the energy and observables @xmath26 were also registered so that thermodynamic derivatives could be evaluated using the relation @xmath27 where @xmath23 is the energy @xcite .",

    "these values are only indicative as they are obtained from the leading terms of a series which ( like the @xmath55-expansion series for the other exponents in isgs ) has never been summed . however , the values are qualitatively consistent with the observed @xmath56 and @xmath57 values for @xmath58 , @xmath6 and @xmath59 .",
