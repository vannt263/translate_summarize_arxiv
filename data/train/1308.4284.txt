    "_ we decided to investigate dust in the lmc because of the insights this galaxy can provide into the connections between star formation and the structure and dynamics of the ism_. it is one of the nearest disc galaxies but is external to our own milky way galaxy , with a separation of 50  55 kpc ( feast 1991 ; alves et al .",

    "the lmc also provides an excellent opportunity to study the effects of uv radiation from stars on their environment in the multi - phase ism .",
    "the lmc is in a low metallicity environment with a small fraction of heavy elements , @xmath8 @xmath9 ( dufour 1984 ) , @xmath100.5 @xmath9 ( westerlund 1997 ) , and therefore contains fewer grain particles than the milky way .",

    "on the other hand , infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) survey data provide a peak flux density at 100 @xmath2 m , and data processing procedures are described in the iras explanatory supplement .",
    "background levels of the iras observations were determined as 0.24 jy / pixel for the 60 @xmath2 m map and 0.57 jy / pixel for the 100 @xmath2 m map using the iras explanatory supplement .",
    "we also considered the effects of dust emission at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data observed at 23 , 41 , and 94 ghz from the wmap 5-year release ( bennett et al .",

    "the interstellar environment contains various types of interstellar dust with a range of different grain properties ( greenberg 1968 ) .",
    "distinct differences in grain size and relative abundance between the milky way and the magellanic clouds can be expected . in general ,",
    "interstellar dust is formed from carbonaceous grains , called graphite or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , of the smallest grains and silicate grains .",
    "these grains of dust result in the absorption or scattering of incoming photons from background objects .",
    "the extinction of the interstellar radiation field in the lmc exhibits a spectral gap in the extinction curve for the milky way and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ( clayton et al . 2000 ; weingartner & draine 2001 ) .",
    "the galaxy exhibits an extinction of background radiation that is approximately inversely proportional to the wavelength .",
    "the distinctive absorption feature at 2175    is thought to depend on the graphite component ( draine & lee 1984 ; li & draine 2001 ) .",
    "the extinction curve for the lmc generally exhibits a similar form at infrared and visible wavelengths although the bump at 2175    is somewhat weaker , and the extinction increases sharply at far - uv wavelengths ( clayton & martin 1985 ) .",
    "this indicates that graphite particles are on average slightly smaller and less abundant in the lmc than in the milky way .",
    "the typical value of the ratio of visual extinction to reddening , @xmath15 , is 3.1  3.5 in the diffuse ism and approximately 5 in the denser regions where grain sizes are larger due to accretion of dust from interstellar gas .",
    "the mean extinction curve in the lmc has been reported using @xmath16 ( weingartner & draine 2001 ) , which is consistent with the diffuse interstellar environment of the lmc .",
    "the classical model of interstellar dust size distribution is based on the observed extinction of starlight along the diffuse line of sight .",
    "mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck ( 1977 ) suggested that the radiative effects of interstellar dust are dependent on the grain size distribution and the silicate and graphite composition .",
    "a typical standard distribution law is :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the number density of grains with size @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the number density of h nuclei , @xmath21 for graphite and @xmath22 for silicate , and @xmath23 is the grain radius , where @xmath24 m in the milky way . here , we used the data reported by piovan et al .",

    "we adopted the functional form for the dust size distribution in the lmc from weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) .",
    "they calculated grain size distributions , including pahs , consistent with the observed extinction for different values of @xmath25 in the local milky way and for regions in the lmc and smc , by considering the different values of the total c abundance per h nucleus , @xmath26 , in log normal components .",
    "piovan et al .",
    "( 2006a ) fitted the extinction curves for the milky way , lmc , and smc by adopting the extinction curves from weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) and minimising the @xmath27 error function .",
    "they also modified the power law of the mrn model by splitting the distribution law of the @xmath28-th component into several intervals . the dimensionless scattering and absorption coefficients , the ratio of @xmath29 to @xmath30@xmath31 , where @xmath23 is the dimension of the grain , including pahs , silicate , and graphite grains were taken from draine & lee ( 1984 ) , laor & draine ( 1993 ) , draine & li ( 2001 ) , and li & draine ( 2001 ) ( and piovan et al .",
    "2006a ) .",
    "the lmc is known to have low metallicity extragalactic environments .",
    "therefore , according to clayton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the dust grain size distributions for graphite and silicate may be reproduced for the extinction of the lmc along the line of sight .",
    "they concluded that the emission was best reproduced when the population of very small grains was the sum of two log normal size distributions as described further in weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) .",
    "according to these authors , the structure of the size distribution , @xmath32 , for the very small carbonaceous grains had only mild effects on extinction for wavelengths in the range of interest .",
    "we calculated the size distributions for silicate and graphite grains in the lmc with @xmath33=3.5  , @xmath34  , @xmath29=0.4 , in the two log normal components ( @xmath35=0.75@xmath26 , @xmath36=0.25@xmath26 ) with the modified mrn model ( weingartner & draine 2001 ) .",

    "1 also shows the size distributions for the milky way using the revised draine & lee ( 1984 ) model adopted by silva et al .",

    "@xmath26 denotes the total @xmath54 abundance per @xmath55 in log normal components .",
    "the grain size distribution follows a power law but has a break that is introduced below @xmath4 where a larger exponent is used .",
    "the results are presented as cases a and b ( weingartner & draine 2001 ) in table 2 and figs . 1 & 2 , which correspond to the different power law indices that we have used for the lmc .",
    "for silicate grains , varying the power law indices did not affect size distribution , whereas distinct variations appeared for graphite grains .",
    "the grain size distribution in case b is in good agreement with the results of piovan et al .",
    "( 2006a ) .",
    "the size of the dust grains used in piovan et al .",
    "( 2006a ) ranged from 1 nm to 300 nm for silicate grains and from 2 nm to 1 @xmath2 m for graphite grains .",
    "the exponent of the best fit is -3.47 ( table 2 and figs . 2 & 3 ) .",
    "carbonaceous grains are diffused throughout the ism due to outflows of the shells of late - type stars such as asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( wood et al .",
    "carbon stars in the lmc mainly consist of m - type stars , which have a low mass loss rate and low luminosity . as the formation efficiency of dust grains decreases , the graphite grain population in the interstellar environment decreases .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that the strength of the 2175   bump in the extinction curve , which is caused by the graphite component of interstellar dust is reduced by a factor of 1.6 , compared with that of the milky way .",
    "radiation in the near - infrared to far - infrared range is strongly affected by the size distribution of dust grains in the diffuse ism ( draine & lee 1984 ; kim et al .",
    "1994 ; li & draine 2001a ) .",
    "the effects of dust on infrared emission depend on chemical and physical composition , the star formation rate , the dust - to - gas mass ratio , and metallicity .",
    "grains are also heated by starlight .",
    "while small grains composed of carbonaceous particles may explain the continuum emission in the mid - infrared and the 2175@xmath56 uv bump in the extinction curve , silicate materials can also have larger grains with diameters in the range of @xmath57 0.1  2.0 @xmath2 m according to the emission at far - infrared wavelengths ( papoular et al .",
