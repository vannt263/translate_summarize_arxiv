    "molecular hydrogen is the most abundant molecular species in the universe , but its spectrum is not so well suited for direct observations , because the strong dipole - allowed transitions in the lyman ( @xmath7 ) and werner ( @xmath8 ) systems fall in the range of the vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) , hence at wavelengths for which the earth s atmosphere is opaque . the first observation of molecular hydrogen in space was reported in 1970  @xcite using a rocket borne spectrometer observing from high altitudes , therewith evading atmospheric absorption of the vuv radiation .",
    "subsequently , absorption lines in the vuv - spectrum of molecular hydrogen were observed with the _ copernicus _ satellite telescope  @xcite .",
    "later the vuv - absorption spectrum of h@xmath5 was observed with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "@xcite and the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "@xcite , all satellite - based instruments .",
    "spectra of molecular hydrogen in highly redshifted objects , e.g. in the line of sight of quasars , can be observed with ground - based telescopes provided the redshift of the absorbing cloud is at @xmath9 .",
    "early observations from earth with tentative assignment of molecular hydrogen were performed by  @xcite .",
    "surveys of damped - lyman-@xmath10 systems in search for pronounced h@xmath5 absorption features were conducted by  @xcite .",
    "the molecular hydrogen spectra in highly redshifted objects were analyzed and compared with classical  @xcite and laser - based laboratory investigations of the lyman bands  @xcite , initially resulting in some indications for a possible variation of the proton - electron mass ratio ( @xmath11 ) at cosmological redshifts  @xcite .",
    "further detailed and accurate studies of molecular hydrogen at high redshift resulted in constraints on a varying proton - electron mass ratio  @xcite now yielding an overall limit of @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "fundamental physics theories predict variation of fundamental constants on cosmological temporal and spatial scales , but the couplings between light scalar fields causing those variations may also generate dependencies of fundamental constants on local gravitational fields  @xcite .",
    "the latter phenomena were explored recently in search of a possible dependence of the fine structure constant @xmath10  @xcite and the proton - electron mass ratio @xmath13  @xcite in the strong gravitational fields prevailing in the photosphere of white dwarf stars .",
    "the search for a @xmath13-dependence on a gravitational potential as strong as 10@xmath14 times that at the earth s surface was based on h@xmath5 lyman band absorptions in white dwarfs gd133 and gd29 - 38 initially discovered by  @xcite , and reanalyzed by  @xcite .    for an analysis of the h@xmath5 absorption spectrum in the hot environment of white dwarf photospheres , at typical temperatures of 12,000 - 14,000 k ,",
    "accurate molecular physics data are required on excitations from highly excited ro - vibrational states in the lyman band system .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to collect and re - evaluate the information on laboratory wavelengths @xmath2 for the relevant lyman bands , and perform a calculation on sensitivity coefficients @xmath1 to @xmath13-variation for the relevant lines .",
    "together with existing information on line oscillator strengths for the transitions @xmath3 and natural lifetime parameters @xmath4 for the upper states  @xcite a constraining value for @xmath15 can be derived in the presence of the strong gravitational fields near the surface of white dwarfs . in section  [ moldat ] an evaluation of the wavelengths @xmath2",
    "will be performed , which will be listed alongside with values for @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in section  [ ksec ]",
    "a calculation of sensitivity coefficients @xmath1 will be presented , following different methods , one based on the semi - empirical analysis of mass dependencies of level energies , and one based on an _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "the combined molecular physics information on h@xmath5 will be applied in section  [ wd ] for the analysis of white dwarf spectra of gd29 - 38 and gd133 , observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph on the hubble space telescope ( cos - hst ) .",
    "parts of the absorption spectra of the photospheres of white dwarfs gd29 - 38 ( wd2327 + 049 ) and gd133 ( wd1116 + 026 ) obtained with cos - hst are plotted in figs .",
    "[ wd-29 - 38 ] and [ wd-133 ] .",
    "the observed spectra  @xcite extend over the range 1144 - 1444  , with @xmath16@xmath17 lyman band lines unambiguously assignable in the window 12981444 , and tentative indications of weak @xmath18@xmath17 werner band transitions in the range 11441290 .",
    "the spectra reflect the high temperatures in the white dwarf photospheres , by the multiple vibrationally  and rotationally  excited levels of the ground electronic state .",
    "the most intense lines belong to the @xmath19 bands of the lyman system .",
    "lines in the lyman bands are indicated by the ( blue ) vertical sticks .",

    "based on the calculations of franck - condon factors  @xcite it can be deduced what bands in the lyman system produce most of the absorption intensity . whereas for excitation from @xmath21 a sequence of vibrational bands contributes to the absorption , in case of excitation from @xmath22 the franck - condon factors yield most of the strength for excitation to @xmath23 , while in case of excitation from @xmath24 excitation to a single @xmath25 level outweighs all other contributions by over an order of magnitude .",
    "this pattern is reflected in the calculations of individual line oscillator strengths @xmath3 for the lyman bands as performed by  @xcite .",
    "similarly , high rotational angular momentum states are populated , peaking at @xmath26 for temperatures of 12,000 k , while transitions originating from states up to @xmath27 are found  @xcite to contribute to the absorption in the spectra shown in figs .",
    "[ wd-29 - 38 ] and [ wd-133 ] .    in order to model the spectra at the highest accuracy possible the wavelengths @xmath2 of the relevant lyman absorption lines have to be included in a model .",
    "the most accurate wavelengths follow from listed level energies for excited @xmath28 and ground @xmath29 quantum states .",
    "starting from level energies is the superior approach over using listed experimental wavelengths , since those level energy values represent averages over several well - calibrated spectral lines .",
    "this approach was followed in the two - step determination of @xmath28 level energies  @xcite , first measuring anchor line energies of some intermediate states in h@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "a subsequent study of transitions between excited states , e.g. the @xmath30 system , provides the high accuracy on @xmath31 level energies from the large data base of lines measured in a broad wavelength interval , including the infrared .",
    "these combined procedures resulted in level energies for @xmath32 up to @xmath33 , for @xmath34 up to @xmath26 , and for @xmath35 up to @xmath36 at accuracies generally at 0.001 @xmath37  or better  @xcite .",
    "these precision experiments do not extend to very high rotational quantum numbers , needed for the analysis of the white dwarf spectra .",
    "for those higher rotational states the most accurate values are those of  @xcite , where level energies are determined from analysis of thousands of lines observed in lyman band emissions obtained from a low - pressure discharge  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath38 level energies were calculated up to @xmath39 in an _ ab initio _ model in which the input potential curves were slightly adapted to represent the experimental data at an accuracy of 0.1 @xmath37 .",
    "these calculations were further tested in a vuv - laser - based experiment performed in a plasma in which high ro - vibrational levels in the @xmath40 system were probed , yielding agreement within the estimated uncertainties of a few 0.1 @xmath37  @xcite .    the comparison of the level energies from  @xcite and  @xcite for low @xmath41 quantum numbers yield good agreement , but with a noticeable systematic offset that is still within the estimated uncertainty of the latter . based on this comparison ,",
    "an energy correction of between 0.04 - 0.06 @xmath37 was applied for each vibrational series in the dataset of  @xcite .",
    "the combined dataset comprising the low @xmath41 level values from  @xcite and the ( corrected ) high @xmath41 level energies from  @xcite was employed in the calculation of the transition wavelengths for the analysis .",
    "similar procedures were also applied to the level energies of the @xmath42 state where the low @xmath41 level energies were taken from  @xcite . for the high @xmath41 levels , energy corrections of between 0.04 - 0.13",
    "@xmath37 was applied for the vibrational series of the @xmath43 states , and 0.06 - 0.11 @xmath37 for the @xmath44 states from  @xcite .    for the ground state",
    "one may rely on the full - fledged _ ab initio _ calculations of all 302 bound @xmath29 quantum levels in the ground state of h@xmath5 .",
    "those values have been calculated , including born - oppenheimer energies , adiabatic and non - adiabatic corrections as well as relativistic and quantum - electrodynamic contributions by  @xcite .",
    "their accuracy at 0.001 @xmath37 has been tested in a number of precision experimental studies on the ground state level energies  @xcite well verifying the claimed accuracy .",
    "wavelengths for lines in the @xmath45 lyman bands are calculated from these data sets on level energies for excited and ground states .",
    "values for the wavelengths and their accuracies , varying between 0.001 @xmath37 and 0.1 @xmath37 ( on a frequency / energy scale ) , are listed for vibrational levels @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the supplementary material , lyman lines , about a third is used in subsequent analysis of white dwarf absorption spectra .",
