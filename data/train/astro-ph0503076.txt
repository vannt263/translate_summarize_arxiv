    "the herbig  ae / be  stars ( herbig 1960 ) are the more massive counterparts of t  tauri stars .",
    "they are characterized by a strong ir excess , emission lines , and luminosity class iii to v ( waters & waelkens 1998 ) .",
    "herbig  ae / be  stars represent an important link between high mass stars that evolve directly from embedded protostars to the zero - age main sequence ( the onset of core h - burning ) and low mass stars that stop accreting before reaching the main sequence and that can be observed in this hydrostatic pre - main sequence phase ( appenzeller 1994 ) .",
    "herbig  ae  stars are often strong x - ray emitters with luminosities of order @xmath6 to @xmath7  ergs  s@xmath3  ( e.g. , hamaguchi et al .  2002 ; 2004 ) .",
    "this high level of activity is possibly linked to the presence of an accretion disk and is probably ultimately driven by magnetic fields .",
    "however , the origin of magnetic fields in herbig  ae  stars is unknown .",
    "main sequence a  stars lack the thick surface convection zones ( gilliland 1986 ) of late - type stars ( and their t  tauri progenitors ) that drive magnetic dynamo activity and power x - ray - emitting chromospheres and hot coronae .",
    "hence , they are weak x - ray emitters ( simon , drake , & kim 1995 ; linsky 2003 ) or even x - ray dark ( schmitt 1997 ) .",
    "perhaps field generation in herbig  ae  stars is not through the solar - type @xmath5@xmath8 dynamo mechanism but from compression of interstellar cloud fields in the initial collapse ( dudorov et al .",
    "1989 ) , induced by deuterium - shell burning during contraction towards the main sequence ( palla & stahler 1993 ) , or generated via internal differential rotation during an early accretion phase ( tout & pringle 1995 ) .",
    "such fields may decay rapidly through turbulent magnetic diffusivity as the radiative core develops and only be present in the youngest herbig  ae  stars .",
    "in analogy to the t  tauri stars , whose x - ray activity is also often much greater than in evolved stars of similar mass , perhaps circumstellar material allows other magnetic configurations such as star - disk and disk - disk fields to generate the strong flares , hard x - ray emission , and high x - ray luminosity seen in some intermediate - mass herbig  ae  systems .",
    "energetic reconnection flares may arise at the corotation interface between dipole stellar fields and the inner disk ( hayashi , shibata , & matsumoto 1996 ; shu et al .",
    "1994 ; birk et al .",
    "2000 ) or through differential rotation of the field - threaded disks themselves ( e.g. , romanova et al .",
    "magnetic fields are believed to regulate protostellar collapse through ambipolar diffusion , to funnel accretion from the disk , and to transfer disk orbital motion to collimated outflows ( see feigelson & montmerle 1999 for a review ) .",

    "the time - variable double - peaked and p  cygni balmer and uv emission line profiles arise from a stellar wind , an extended chromosphere , and/or rotation ( e.g. , catala et al .",
    "radio continuum observations ( brown , perez , & yusef - zadeh 1993 ) of hd  163296  also suggest wind - driven mass loss .",

    "the combination of an accretion disk and jet in a relatively old herbig  ae  object , a low extinction due to a lack of association with dark clouds , the presence of herbig - haro  objects along the jet axis , and an otherwise source - free field make hd  163296  a particularly promising object for high - resolution x - ray imaging spectroscopy .",
    "it is found that the bulk of the x - ray emission is associated with the central star and its immediate surroundings .",

    "nine weak point - like sources ( each with 9 to 17 counts detected corresponding to signal - to - noise ratios of 2.5 to 3.6 ) and one bright source ( 1131 counts ) were detected in the field .",
    "one of the weak sources is 0.20 offset in right ascension from a source in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) all - sky data release catalogue .",
    "this is comparable to the estimated statistical uncertainty in the x - ray position of that source .",
    "no other astrometric catalog matches were found for any of the other weak x - ray sources .",

    "in addition , long - slit stis spectra of hd  163296  are characteristic of chromospheric and transition region spectra of early - type stars and display the spatial profile of an unresolved point source .",
    "the emission line features seen in these and in fuse data ( grady et al .",
    "2004b ) are uniformly broad and often double - peaked .",
    "such features are characteristic of herbig  ae  stars and are much broader than those of late - type stars ; even rapid rotators like the m1ve star au  mic ( pagano et al .",

    "both line and uv / fuv emission are spatially coincident , at the resolution of _ hubble _ , with the photosphere of hd  163296 .",
    "in particular , emission associated with transition region temperature plasma , n  v and o  vi , originate on the rapidly rotating hd  163296  rather than on a more slowly rotating , but otherwise unseen , late - type companion .",

    "herbig - haro knots associated with the jet and counter jet of hd  163296  are visible in the raw gfp observation , and can be traced out to @xmath3227  from the star after subtraction of the off - band image .",
    "the knots in both the jet and counterjet were measured at s / n@xmath1010 .",
    "the weak x - ray feature does not overlap any of the optical knots when their positions are devolved to the time of the x - ray observation using the known knot proper motions .",
    "the spatial distribution of the x - ray events from the central portion of hd  163296  was compared to a model point spread function ( psf ) to test for possible source extension .",

    "the radial profile ( averaged over azimuth ) of the data shows a slight excess above the model psf in an annulus between 0.5 and @xmath12.5 of the emission peak .",
    "however , the ray - trace software does not account for spacecraft dither and the observed excess is consistent with this model limitation .",
    "therefore , except for emission along the jet , there is no conclusive evidence that the bright source is extended .",

    "additional models were applied to try to improve the fits and to better characterize the composition and intrinsic absorption column .",

    "the accretion rate and magnetic field strength of hd  163296  can be better determined when the contributions from the observed mass outflow are properly accounted for in the overall energy budget .",
    "until then we conclude that the x - ray emission from hd  163296  is most consistent with an optically - thin shocked accretion flow confined by a stellar ( dipole ) magnetic field of unknown origin .",
    "the x - ray data do not require a a late - type companion be present , and are in fact inconsistent with the hotter coronal temperatures ( @xmath96  k ) that typically characterize active late - type stellar coronae .",
    "a high accretion rate and strong magnetic field are also not required , though would ease difficulties that are otherwise present in explaining the accretion - driven x - rays using simplistic accretion shock models .",
    "hd  163296  is remarkable in being in a class of a very few pre - main sequence stars whose observed x - ray emission has such a cool characteristic temperature that it can be entirely explained in terms of accretion .",

    "there is to our knowledge only one other pms object whose x - ray emission is also accretion - dominated : the nearby t  tauri star tw  hya ( e.g.  kastner et al .",
    "other phenomena such as giant outbursts have also been observed ( kastner et al .",
    "2004 ) that signal the onset of mass accretion at rates much higher than required to explain the x - ray behavior reported here for hd 163296 .",
    "detection of x - ray emission associated with herbig - haro  objects is not unprecedented .",
    "these shock - heated objects are formed when supersonic outflow collides with ambient material or previous ejecta ( e.g. , schwartz 1983 ) .",
