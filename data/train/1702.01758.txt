    "during the past few decades , concurrently with the experimental confirmation of three - neutrino oscillations , several additional oscillation - like anomalous experimental signatures have surfaced , which may require new physics to interpret .",
    "one possible such new physics interpretation is that of additional , light sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "those are new neutrino states which are assumed to have no weak interactions and are associated with light neutrino masses of order @xmath4  ev .",
    "the mass states are thought to have small weak flavor content ( electron , muon , and potentially tau ) , leading to small - amplitude neutrino oscillations at relatively small @xmath5  m / mev .",
    "the constraint of small weak flavor content ( in particular electron and muon flavor ) is imposed by unitarity of the overall neutrino mixing matrix , together with existing experimental bounds on the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath6 over which such oscillations manifest is what dictates the associated mass splittings of @xmath7  ev@xmath8 .",
    "this signature is often referred to as short - baseline oscillations .",
    "these anomalous short - baseline oscillation observations are contributed primarily by the lsnd @xcite and miniboone @xcite experiments .",
    "both experiments have searched for @xmath9 appearance in a @xmath10-dominated beam , at a similar @xmath6 , albeit each at a different @xmath11 , and with a different neutrino beam energy , @xmath12 . a third observation consistent with short - baseline oscillations has been provided in the @xmath9 disappearance channel from calibration measurements employing intense radioactive sources of high @xmath9 flux in radiochemical experiments , during the mid 1980 s @xcite .",
    "a fourth hint had been provided by past reactor - based short - baseline oscillation searches ; specifically , recent reactor data re - analyses using updated reactor flux predictions showed evidence of a deficit in the reactor electron antineutrino event rates measured collectively by several experiments at @xmath6 values ranging between 2 - 20  m / mev .",
    "this has been referred to as the `` reactor anomaly ''  @xcite .",
    "however , recent realizations that large and unaccounted - for systematic uncertainties are associated with reactor neutrino flux predictions ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) dictate that the reactor anomaly can not yet be interpreted decisively as a light sterile neutrino oscillation signature ; such interpretations should await either improved reactor antineutrino flux modelling or dedicated searches for light sterile neutrino oscillations at reactor short baselines which are sensitive to distortions in reconstructed event spectra that are @xmath6 dependent .",
    "such searches are now under way with a number of experiments @xcite .    interpreting the above @xmath13 appearance and @xmath9 disappearance observations as sterile neutrino oscillations would imply large @xmath10 disappearance observable at short baselines .",
    "such signature has not yet been observed ; on the contrary , multiple experiments have imposed stringent bounds on sterile neutrino mixing parameters involved in the @xmath14 disappearance channel , bringing the viability of sterile neutrino models into question @xcite .",
    "the most recent @xmath10 disappearance data sets include icecube  @xcite and minos+  @xcite .",
    "the most up to date global fits and results , incorporating icecube constraints , are presented in ref .",
    "despite the strong disappearance constraints , the miniboone , lsnd , and arguably the calibration source experimental results still stand as anomalous observations that require further investigation to resolve .    to definitively address these collective anomalies , the short baseline neutrino ( sbn ) experimental program  @xcite was successfully proposed and is now under construction in the booster neutrino beamline ( bnb ) at fermilab .",
    "the bnb provides a high intensity , sign - selected , primarily ( @xmath1599% ) muon neutrino ( and muon antineutrino ) flux  @xcite .",
    "three liquid argon time projection chamber ( lartpc ) detectors , comprising the already operating microboone detector , the sbnd detector which is under construction , and the icarus detector which is under refurbishment , sample the @xmath9 and @xmath10 flux content at three distinct baselines .",
    "this allows sbn to perform electron neutrino appearance and muon neutrino disappearance searches with highly competitive sensitivity coverage , as presented in the sbn proposal @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the discovery potential of sbn has only been considered for the simplest sterile neutrino oscillation scenario , where only a single additional , mostly sterile neutrino mass eigenstate is assumed ; this scenario is referred to as a ( 3 + 1 ) scenario .    in this paper",
    ", we perform an independent phenomenological study where we expand beyond the ( 3 + 1 ) scenario and , for the first time , evaluate sbn s sensitivity to sterile neutrino oscillation models with two and three additional sterile neutrinos , referred to as ( 3 + 2 ) and ( 3 + 3 ) , respectively .",
    "furthermore , for the ( 3 + 1 ) scenario , we re - evaluate sbn s sensitivity to electron neutrino appearance without the explicit assumption of negligible disappearance of intrinsic @xmath9 backgrounds , extending beyond what has been followed by the sbn collaboration in @xcite . finally ,",
    "for the ( 3 + 2 ) scenario , we explore sbn s sensitivity to additional cp violation that is potentially observable under this oscillation assumption .",
    "although currently sbn is only approved to run in neutrino mode , it is interesting to consider what potential antineutrino mode running could add in terms of sensitivity to cp violation phases .",
    "we explore this question more explicitly for added antineutrino beam running at sbn , beyond the presently planned neutrino running .",
    "the large ( 3+@xmath0 ) parameter space dimensionality for @xmath16 makes it particularly challenging to provide simple and meaningful quantitative statements on sbn s sensitivity reach with respect to these models . to deal with this issue",
    ", we have devised a new sensitivity metric that exploits existing experimental constraints to sterile neutrino oscillation scenarios to effectively reduce the parameter space over which sbn s sensitivity reach must be quantified .",
    "the constraints are provided in the form of global fits to a representative sample of short - baseline oscillation data sets ( both signal and null results ) , and are used to define a hypervolume of allowed parameter space under each ( 3+@xmath0 ) hypothesis over which sbn s sensitivity is evaluated .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to account for three - neutrino oscillations , the standard model prescribes three neutrinos that are pure and distinct eigenstates of the weak interaction : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath18 , each of which is a linear combination of three distinct neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "the weak eigenstates are defined as @xmath19 or @xmath20 , and @xmath21 represents the elements of the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix , a @xmath22 , unitary , leptonic mixing matrix .    to determine the probability of a neutrino of flavor @xmath23 to be detected as flavor @xmath24 after travelling some distance @xmath11 and having energy @xmath12 , one may treat the neutrino as a plane wave and evolve the waveform over time .",
    "this gives an `` oscillation '' probability of @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 run over the three neutrino mass eigenstate indices , and @xmath28 define the mass - squared splitting between any two of the three neutrino mass states .",
    "the expression can be further parametrized as @xmath29\\sin^2(1.27 \\delta",

    "antineutrino oscillation can be similarly calculated by substituting the mixing matrix elements @xmath21 with their complex conjugates , @xmath31 .    from the general oscillation probability formula in eq .",
    "[ eq : genosc ] , one can add the effects of @xmath0 sterile neutrinos by expanding the pnms matrix to a @xmath32n@xmath33 , unitary mixing matrix , and summing over @xmath34 distinct mass eigenstates . in this paper , it is assumed that the additional neutrino mass states , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , will each be on the order of 0.1 - 10  ev , which follows from past and recent global fits  @xcite .",
    "the two lowest mass - squared splittings , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are both well - established through multiple independent experiments and of order @xmath40 ev@xmath8 and @xmath41 ev@xmath8 .",
    "as both are sufficiently small , one may apply the short - baseline approximation to this formalism , wherein the three lowest mass states are set to be degenerate at @xmath42  ev .",
    "this also assumes a hierarchy where the @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 mass states are the lightest .    with the above assumptions and approximations , for a ( 3 + 1 ) model",
    ", the oscillation probabilities for appearance and disappearance are given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively , where @xmath48 .",
    "thanks to the short - baseline approximation and the unitarity of the pmns matrix , this case bears striking resemblance to a two neutrino oscillation .    for a ( 3 + 2 ) model ,",
    "the oscillation probability is given by @xmath49 in the case of appearance ( @xmath50 ) , and @xmath51 in the case of disappearance .",
    "note that for ( 3+@xmath0 ) neutrino models with n @xmath15 1 , one must consider the complex phases of the ( extended ) mixing matrix .",
    "those appear as cp - violating phases @xmath52 in the oscillation probability , and are defined as @xmath53 for neutrino oscillations , and @xmath54 for antineutrino oscillations .",
    "this is equivalent to substituting @xmath52 with @xmath55 in eq .",
    "[ eq:3p2app ] when considering _ antineutrino _ appearance probabilities .",
    "lastly , the ( 3 + 3 ) oscillation probability is given by @xmath56 in the case of appearance , and @xmath57 in the case of disappearance .",
    "in this case , there are three cp - violating phases which are free parameters of the model , @xmath2 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "for any ( 3+@xmath0 ) scenario under consideration , we first perform a fit over existing short - baseline neutrino experiment data , to extract the globally - allowed 90% and 99% confidence level ( cl ) regions over the full available oscillation parameter space .",
    "this is done primarily out of computational considerations , in order to obtain a reduced oscillation phase - space over which we subsequently quantify the sbn sensitivity .",

    "when quantifying sbn s sensitivity , we are interested primarily in two fitting methods :    * @xmath9 appearance - only fits , where @xmath61 is evaluated assuming only @xmath62 oscillations , and no @xmath9 or @xmath14 disappearance ; this is the method followed by past miniboone oscillation searches @xcite as well as in ref .",

    "also is the prediction for microboone ( @xmath68boone ) after its first 6.6e20  pot exposure .    due to the proximity of the sbnd experiment to the bnb target ,",
    "the flux of intrinsic @xmath9 at the detector is extremely large .",
    "specifically , sbnd expects to record over 35,000  @xmath9 cc events for 6.6e20  pot .",

    "it is also a direct probe of @xmath71 using a high - energy neutrino beam in complementarity with the mev - scale antineutrino reactor flux searches .    although instructive , none of the above three cases are actually appropriate for an sbn oscillation search if one assumes that the sterile neutrino contains mixing to both the electron and muon sectors . instead , a proper search for oscillations at sbn should consider the simultaneous effects of both @xmath9 disappearance and @xmath10 disappearance and , consequently , @xmath9 appearance .",
    "we therefore adopt this case , referred to as @xmath9 dis / appearance and @xmath14 disappearance , as the proper sbn sensitivity search method , and we present results corresponding to this case throughout the following sections .    as the primary physics goal of the sbn programme is to _",
    "definitively _ probe the light sterile neutrino sector that could be responsible for the low - energy anomalies , we use the new metric defined in previous sections to quantify how well sbn can achieve this goal under each of the ( 3 + 1 ) , ( 3 + 2 ) and ( 3 + 3 ) scenarios .",
    "this metric is referred to as _ global @xmath72%",
    "cl `` coverage '' _ , and it refers to the fraction of hypervolume of the @xmath72% cl globally - allowed oscillation parameter space that can be ruled out by sbn with a certain confidence level , if sbn observed no oscillations . to estimate global coverage , we first discretize the sterile neutrino parameter space in 100 points in each independent mass - squared difference , mixing element , and cp phase .",
    "the mass - squared differences are each discretized over the range of 0.01  ev@xmath8 to 100  ev@xmath8 ( in grid points that are equidistant in logarithmic scale ) , while the mixing elements @xmath73 are discretized in 100 linearly spaced grid points ranging from 0 to 0.5 , and the cp - violating phases in 100 points ranging linearly from 0 to @xmath74 .",
    "this allows to calculate a hypervolume represented by the number of space points or the `` _ _ size _ _ '' of parameter space that is preferentially allowed by global data at a given confidence interval ( in our case , 99% ) .",
    "we can then express sbn s sensitivity reach as the fractional number of space points or fraction of this hypervolume that sbn can exclude at any given confidence level .",

    "this is expected for the ( 3 + 1 ) scenario , as neutrino and antineutrino oscillation probabilities under the two - neutrino oscillation approximation we ve employed are identical by construction . therefore , antineutrino running offers no additional information , and it is generally less efficient due to the lower flux and cross - section , and , hence , event statistics .",
    "figures  [ fig:3p2_nuvnubar ] and [ fig:3p3_nuvnubar ] show the same information for the ( 3 + 2 ) and ( 3 + 3 ) scenarios , respectively .",
    "interestingly , just as in the ( 3 + 1 ) case , we observe again that it is far more efficient to cover any given fraction of parameter space with additional neutrino - only rather than antineutrino - only or any combination of neutrino plus antineutrino running . at first this may seem counter - intuitive , as it may be expected that antineutrino running would provide visibly more coverage due to enhanced sensitivity to cp - violating phases in these scenarios .",
    "however , the increased statistics per pot that are available in neutrino mode running are far more efficient in constraining all other mixing parameters and masses allowed in these oscillation hypotheses .",
    "since these plots quantify overall coverage of the @xmath80-dimensional phase - space in each scenario , it is quite reasonable ( and arguably expected ) that antineutrino running proves less effective in terms of this metric .",
    "+     +     +    in the absence of a possible signal , additional pot in antineutrino mode ( as opposed to neutrino mode ) does _ not _ help to rule out the null hypothesis faster , for any scenario .",
    "it can be argued that sbn s sensitivity to cp violation through comparisons of neutrino and antineutrino running spectra suffers from the significant wrong - sign neutrino contribution inherent in the bnb beam when running in antineutrino mode .",
    "further studies into methods of differentiating between neutrino and antineutrino events in a lartpc , such as exploiting @xmath81 absorption rates on argon or the difference in @xmath82 distributions of @xmath83 and @xmath84 interactions , would be especially useful in quantifying the impact on sbn s sensitivity to cp violation , and also of interest to lartpc development in general",
    ". it would also be worthwhile for sbn to consider whether any bnb optimization is possible and could be implemented to minimize the wrong - sign flux .",
    "on the other hand , if sbn observes a sterile neutrino - like signal in neutrino running mode , the focus would quickly turn to the subsequent measurement of the new parameters . here",
    ", the impact of sbn antineutrino running may become important , providing access to a potentially distinctly different observable oscillation probability than the neutrino run would allow .",
    "however , the challenge is that the cp - violating phase effects become degenerate with those of the remaining oscillation parameters , in particular with insufficient detector energy resolution . in",
    "what follows , we explore this possibility , but we focus solely on the ( 3 + 2 ) scenario with a single cp - violating phase @xmath2 , for simplicity ; however , these metrics could be applied to the ( 3 + 3 ) scenario with minimal expansion .",
    "the sensitivity of sbn to the cp - violating phase @xmath2 is studied under the hypothesis that sbn observes a signal consistent with two light sterile neutrinos .",
    "to analyse this sensitivity we inject potential signals , for a given set of oscillation parameters , into the fit .",
    "these injected parameters are labelled as `` true '' parameters , and the spectra produced when one assumes these parameters take the place of the `` null '' spectra in the @xmath17 calculation and covariance matrix construction as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] .",
    "this @xmath17 quantifies sbn s ability to confirm a certain set of oscillation parameters given a hypothetical signal .",
    "sensitivity to @xmath2 is due solely to the @xmath9-appearance channel in which it uniquely appears . due to this as well as the large number of degrees of freedoms in the ( 3 + 2 ) sterile neutrino scenario ,",
    "we make here the simplifying assumption that @xmath85 and analyse under the assumption of @xmath9 appearance only , so as to better understand and convey the behaviour in 2d of the main parameter of interest , @xmath2 .",
    "although allowing all parameters to vary uniquely does indeed change the quantitative results , the qualitative phenomenology remains consistent .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi54_sens_4.7_bf ] , we show a sample scenario in which we inject a true @xmath2 of @xmath86 , for values of mass splittings from our simulated grid , chosen to be closest to the global best fit , @xmath87  ev@xmath8 and @xmath88  ev@xmath8 .",
    "we then vary the strength of the active neutrino - sterile neutrino mixings , @xmath89 and show the range of possible reconstructed @xmath2 values which fit the injected signal within a given confidence level , all the while marginalizing over remaining mixing elements .    for a mass splitting of @xmath90  ev@xmath8 , explaining the lsnd anomaly requires mixings of order @xmath91 .",
    "we note that @xmath2 resolution in this region varies from no - sensitivity to @xmath92 40@xmath93 at the @xmath94 level . under the standard exposure of 6.6e20  pot in neutrino mode alone ( red solid line ) one can see there is no sensitivity for even the largest values of mixing parameters consistent with the ( 3 + 2 ) global data , @xmath95 . as such",
    ", we concentrate on whether of not it is advantageous to run further in neutrino mode ( red dashed line ) or a combination of neutrino and antineutrino running mode ( purple shaded regions ) .",
    "as can be seen , for unrealistically large mixing , sbn can strongly pick out the true @xmath2 , but , as the mixing drops , the resolution on @xmath2 reduces until one reaches @xmath96 , by which all values of @xmath2 are indistinguishable .",
    "we also show the 2@xmath76 contour for the case in which we run entirely in neutrino - mode for an additional 6.6e20  pot ( red dashed lines ) and note that for the majority of the parameter space , is worse than a combined neutrino and antineutrino exposure .",
    "the exact sensitivity of @xmath2 depends not only on the magnitude of mixings , but also on the assumed mass splittings . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi54_sens_1.5_max3 ] , we repeat the same analysis for @xmath97 , @xmath98 ev@xmath8 and @xmath99  ev@xmath8 .",
    "this point corresponds to the point with largest mixings allowed in our ( 3 + 2 ) global fit at the 99% cl .",
    "the green shaded region assumes 6.6e20  pot in both neutrino and antineutrino running and shows sensitivity to @xmath2 for values of values of @xmath100 as low as @xmath101 .",
    "again we see that running in 50:50 neutrino and antineutrino running mode , over pure neutrino mode ( red lines ) , allows one to measure the true value of @xmath2 with much higher resolution .",
    "a related measurement to that of determining the value of @xmath2 given an observed signal , is the significance with which sbn could potentially rule out the cp conserving values of @xmath102 or @xmath103 . establishing cp violation in the sterile neutrino sector would be a crucially important discovery in itself , as well as of great relevance to future experiments looking to measure the standard three - neutrino phase @xmath104 @xcite . to estimate sbn",
    "s reach with respect to this question , for a given injected signal with @xmath105 and fixed values of @xmath106 and @xmath73 , we form the metric @xmath107~.\\ ] ] in each @xmath108 , all active - sterile neutrino mixing elements are varied in order to find the set which minimizes the @xmath17 under consideration , to account for possible degeneracies in the observed spectra .",
    "to get as realistic a measurement as possible we relax the simplifying constraint that @xmath109 and allow all parameters to vary , fitting to a combined @xmath9 appearance and @xmath14 and @xmath9 disappearance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpviolation ] , we show the results of this test for the same two possible injected signals as in figs .",
    "16 and 17the global ( 3 + 2 ) best fit point ( red lines ) and the `` maximum allowed mixing '' point ( blue lines ) . for smaller values of mixings , corresponding to the best fit point , little or no spectral shifts can be measured due to varying @xmath2 , and as such even for maximally violating cp angle values , @xmath2 can always be mis - reconstructed to one of the cp conserving value , with shifts in @xmath73 to compensate for the rate .",
    "the results for the nominal sbn run plan of 6.6e20  pot in neutrino mode is shown by the solid line and shows no sensitivity to cp violation ; similarly , if we assume an additional 6.6e20  pot in neutrino mode , the situation does not change ( dotted line ) significantly .",
    "although the inclusion of 6.6e20  pot in antineutrino mode ( dashed line ) does double the potential sensitivity , this remains a sub-@xmath94 effect and thus it is clear that within reasonable exposure sbn is completely insensitive to cp violation if nature does choose sterile neutrinos at this mass splitting .",
    "+ as the strength of mixing increases , individual variations in the energy spectrum due to @xmath2 driven oscillations becomes harder for degeneracies in mixing to explain , and the significance at which certain cp - violating phases are in disagreement with @xmath102 or @xmath103 increases .",
    "this is evident when we look at the cp violation curves assuming the `` maximum allowed mixing '' sterile neutrino parameters . if we again assume a standard exposure of 6.6e20  pot in neutrino mode ( solid blue line ) it is evident that sbn has no sensitivity to cp violation , with significance s of less than @xmath94 even with maximum cp violation .",
    "doubling the pot in neutrino mode ( dotted blue line ) gives an effectively negligible increase , but it is here that the benefits of additional antineutrino running is most evident . an additional 6.6e20  pot in antineutrino mode allows for  @xmath110 significance at maximal mixing , with @xmath111 significance over 68% of @xmath2 parameter space . although certainly not enough to claim discovery , sbn could provide the first hints of cp violation in the sterile neutrino sector in this specific scenario .",
    "it is worth clarifying that even if nature is kind enough to choose a maximally cp - violating phase , @xmath112 or @xmath113 , thus enabling sbn to potentially observe cp violation at the  2@xmath76 significance level , it would still require large mixings that are already somewhat in tension with global data @xmath114 , and only certain sterile neutrino mass splittings .",
    "for non - maximally violating cp phases the significance at which sbn can make statements diminishes rapidly , and for the majority of the parameter space motivated by the short - baseline anomalies , the potential for sbn to measure a cp - violating phase to the accuracy necessary to rule out cp conservation is very low and insignificant .",
    "conversely , for values of active - sterile neutrino mixings and @xmath115 splittings outside of those considered here , namely ones which help less to explain the short - baseline anomalies but could be interesting models nonetheless , the sensitivity to cp violation could be significantly greater than those presented here .",
    "we have considered , for the very first time , sbn s sensitivity to extended light sterile neutrino oscillation scenarios .",
    "we find that , in the case of a ( 3 + 1 ) oscillation scenario , sbn is capable of definitively exploring ( i.e.  with 5@xmath76 coverage ) 85% of the 99% cl parameter space region which is allowed by global short - baseline oscillation data ( for 3  @xmath67 ) .",
    "this is possible after a three year neutrino mode run with all three sbn detectors running concurrently to collect data corresponding to 6.6e20  pot , and with a combined @xmath9 dis / appearance and @xmath14 disappearance search .",
    "furthermore , by performing such a combined search , microboone alone , during its first three years of running prior to the sbn program commencing , will be able to test 25% of the globally allowed ( 3 + 1 ) oscillation parameter space at 3@xmath76 .    in the case of a ( 3 + 2 ) scenario , in its planned three - year neutrino run , sbn can definitively explore 95% of the 99% cl allowed parameter space ( 7  @xmath67 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "a single cp - violating phase , @xmath2 , enters in the @xmath13 appearance probability and leads to differences in neutrino and antineutrino appearance probabilities .",
    "dedicated bnb antineutrino mode running for three years ( 6.6e20  pot ) , beyond the currently planned sbn neutrino mode running , does not significantly expand sbn s 5@xmath76 sensitivity for ruling out this oscillation scenario . nevertheless , by performing a multi - baseline and multi - channel oscillation search with sign - selected neutrino and antineutrino beams , the sbn experiment will be able to , within six years of operation , overconstrain a significant fraction of parameter space which is currently allowed by global fits to sterile neutrino oscillation .",
    "furthermore , in the case where a potential signal consistent with multiple light sterile - neutrinos is confirmed , dedicated antineutrino running at sbn proves to be of substantial value in increasing the significance of an observation of any cp violation .",
    "for the ( 3 + 2 ) sterile neutrino scenario , an additional 6.6e20  pot in antineutrino running mode could allow sbn to provide the first  @xmath110 hints of cp violation in the ( extended ) lepton sector , provided nature chooses maximal cp - violating phases @xmath112 or @xmath116 , and oscillation parameters consistent with global data at the 99% cl : @xmath98  ev@xmath8 , @xmath99  ev@xmath8 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 . for sbn to be able to observe cp violation at a greater significance than this would require active - sterile mixing already in significant tension with global data .",
    "it is possible that a higher significance could be achieved if the sbn detectors are capable of differentiating between neutrino and antineutrino interactions , either on an event - by - event basis , or through additional statistical treatment of the event samples .",
    "such possibility would be worth exploring through dedicated studies , or through potential beam design upgrades .    in the case of a ( 3 + 3 ) scenario , in its planned three - year neutrino run",
    ", sbn can definitively explore 55% of the currently allowed parameter space .",
    "we further note that in all scenarios , ( 3 + 1 ) , ( 3 + 2 ) , and ( 3 + 3 ) , utilizing a simultaneous search for oscillations in multiple channels ( @xmath9 appearance , @xmath9 disappearance , and @xmath10 disappearance ) has a signficant effect on the sensitivity reach .",
    "in particular , combining @xmath9 and @xmath14 channels is generally more powerful than exclusive channel searches , except when @xmath9 disappearance effects are included in the fit . the latter tend to slightly degrade the sensitivity , due to added degeneracies of the effectively opposite @xmath9 appearance and @xmath9 disappearance effects . as such",
    ", it would be prudent for sbn to carry out a multi - channel search that accounts for all three effects simultaneously .",
    "finally , we must point out a caveat in these studies , in that the experimental data sets used to constrain the ( 3+@xmath0 ) oscillation parameter suffer from large apparent incompatibility within the parameter space they seem to prefer .",
    "still , we consider it a more conservative approach to consider the globally - allowed rather than the anomaly - allowed region in exploring sbn s discovery reach in terms of fractional coverage of allowed parameter space .",
