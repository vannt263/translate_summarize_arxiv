    "the experiments of meekhof et al @xcite have revealed quantum dynamics characteristic of the jaynes - cummings type ( especially collapses and revivals of excitation probabilities ) @xcite for the first time in a trapped ion system . stimulated raman transitions coupled the internal states of a trapped @xmath1 ion to its motional states , within the lamb - dicke limit of tight ion motion confinement in the trapping potential .",
    "the jaynes - cummings spin - boson hamiltonian then derives from the coupling of the internal electronic states of the ion to the vibrational quantum states of motion .",
    "the characteristic quantum dynamics ( collapse and revival ) of the jaynes - cummings type interaction for the ion motion @xcite ( in the experiment of meekhof et al @xcite , an `` _ anti _ jaynes - cummings interaction '' for driving the first blue sideband ) were observed in the population of the lower atomic state ( @xmath2 ) , which was modelled by the phenomenological form fitting the observation as @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the initial probability distribution for the motional states in the fock state basis , @xmath5 is a coupling constant between the motional states and atomic states ( rabi frequency ) , and @xmath6 is a phenomenological damping rate . the observed damping rate can be written as @xmath7 with @xmath8 observed in the experiments of ref @xcite",
    ". the damping rate of the @xmath9th component is independent of that of different components , so that equation ( [ eqn : probexper ] ) implies decoherence without there being transitions between the states of different quantum numbers ( energy relaxation ) .",
    "the conventional sources of decoherence , such as spontaneous emission between internal atomic states , and population decay of motional states , cause transitions between the states of different quantum numbers and do not give the decay rate in a form which can be written as @xmath6 .",
    "there have been suggestions @xcite as to the origin of this decoherence with the unusual observed value of @xmath10 , in terms of decoherence of the ion motion , decoherence of the ion internal levels , and decoherence caused by non - ideal applied fields but the situation has not yet been satisfactorily resolved .    in this paper , we introduce phenomenologically new sources of decoherence , which destroy the characteristic jaynes - cummings type dynamics without energy relaxation , by coupling the spin - boson system to a quantum reservoir @xcite .",
    "the reservoir consists of many - mode bosons described by a canonical distribution at temperature @xmath11 and introduces noise to the system .",
    "we treat decoherence microscopically using a master equation .",
    "the master equation coincides with that for stochastic white noise in the high temperature limit of the reservoir under certain approximations ( markovian approximation and ohmic density of states of the reservoir @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of using a quantum boson reservoir is that it not only describes phenomenological quantum noise , but also gives more microscopic information on the source of decoherence , e.g. the noise frequency being responsible for decoherence even in the high temperature limit . using this combined approach from two directions ( phenomenological and microscopic ) we discuss the origins of decoherence in this system .",
    "before investigating decoherence , we consider the system without decoherence , reviewing how the stimulated raman transitions describe the `` anti jaynes - cummings '' interaction @xcite when the first blue sideband is driven , and introducing the dressed states description of the anti jaynes - cummings system .",
    "we note that the first red sideband driven case ( the jaynes - cummings interaction case ) can be treated just in the same manner , where we exchange the two relevant internal atomic levels @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the following formulation .",
    "we consider a system with three internal levels @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and their motional states @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "they are represented by the following hamiltonian : @xmath18 where @xmath19 with the transition frequency @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) between states @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 , the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the motional states @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , and the frequency of the motional states @xmath27 .",
    "we employ two driving laser beams with detuning @xmath28 , momentum @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and frequency @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) which cause dipole transitions between the level @xmath22 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath33 .",

    "= 3.truein    we apply the rotating wave approximation to the interaction hamiltonian ( [ eqn : int0 ] ) , transform to the interaction picture ( @xmath39 ) and expand in terms of the motional state quantum numbers . when the blue sideband is driven , we have @xmath40 where we have introduced the dipole operators @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and the quantities @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the large detuning condition allows the adiabatic elimination of the level @xmath24 @xcite . under this condition ,",
    "raman transitions dominate the system .",
    "we also assume the system is cool enough to reach the lamb - dicke limit ( @xmath45 ) so we can expand @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the mass of the ion .",

    "decoherence is the decay of the off - diagonal elements which represent the characteristic quantum dynamics , so we can use this hamiltonian to explore some of the sources of decoherence in this interaction picture in the next section .",
    "when working in the interaction picture , it is convenient to introduce the dressed states for the effective hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hinteff ] ) : @xmath58 which are the eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we write the eigenvalue of ( [ eqn : eigens1 ] ) as @xmath59 , of ( [ eqn : eigens2 ] ) as @xmath60 , of ( [ eqn : eigens0 ] ) as @xmath61 , so we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we write the reduced density operator in the dressed state basis as @xmath64 for the boson quantum numbers @xmath65 and the spin quantum numbers @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , @xmath68,@xmath69 , @xmath70 are matrix elements . then the population of the lower atomic state @xmath2 is @xmath71 }   \\right ) .",

    "we next consider the system with the effective hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hinteff ] ) described in the previous section now surrounded by the environment , that is , as an open system .",
    "noise from the environment causes decoherence @xcite .",
    "we treat this open system by coupling to a quantum reservoir , which consists of an infinite number of many mode bosons @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the @xmath76th reservoir frequency , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the creation and annihilation operators of the reservoir bosons .",
    "since the reservoir has infinitely greater degrees of freedom , the reservoir bosons are not affected by the system .",
    "then the time evolution of the reservoir boson operators are given by @xmath79 the system - reservoir coupling hamiltonian is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the coupling between a system operator @xmath82 and the @xmath76th reservoir mode .",
    "the sum of the system operators @xmath83 has to be hermitian . in the master equation derived from the system - reservoir coupling ( [ eqn : srint ] ) , the damping term consists of the system operators coupling to the reservoir operators .",
    "thus the choice of the coupling between system operators and the reservoir determines the effect of the reservoir .",
    "if we choose a system operator @xmath82 with the property @xmath84 the resulting master equation describes relaxation within the dressed states of the quantum number @xmath9 , but not energy relaxation between states with different @xmath9 .",
    "this is because the time evolution of the density matrix elements in terms of @xmath85 decouples for different @xmath9 .",
    "the operators @xmath86 , @xmath87 are obviously of this type , as these operators do not even change the motional states @xmath16 as well as the dressed state label @xmath9 .",
    "the operator @xmath88 changes the motional state , but this operator does not change the dressed state occupation label @xmath9 , so @xmath89 is of this type , too . on the other hand",
    ", if we choose @xmath82 with @xmath90 then the resulting master equation describes transitions between states with different boson quantum numbers , which cause energy relaxation ; @xmath91 and @xmath92 are of this type .",
    "first , we treat the case when the system operator which is coupling to the reservoir is @xmath89 .",
    "this case looks strange at first sight , but we can consider this as the result of imperfect dipole transitions between the level @xmath93 and the level @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) due to fluctuations of the driving laser intensity . we have previously described how phase fluctuations lead to decoherence and the destruction of quantum revivals in the jaynes - cummings model @xcite .",
    "this is one particular realization of `` intrinsic decoherence '' in which off - diagonal density matrix elements relax _ without _ energy relaxation @xcite .",
    "we note that these earlier results of ours apply to the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite if the source of decoherence is relative phase fluctuations driving the ionic raman transition .",
    "here we analyse more general sources of decoherence .",

    "in summary , we have shown here a model describing decoherence which destroys the characteristic quantum dynamics ( collapse and revival ) of the jaynes - cummings system without energy relaxation for the ion trap experiment @xcite .",
    "the sources of decoherence are first introduced phenomenologically and then described by a master equation using a microscopic hamilton formulation .",

    "we solve the master equation under the markovian approximation and continuum limit of the reservoir modes .",
    "the analytical solution shows that decoherence is described by the reservoir bosons with frequency @xmath191 .",
    "therefore , the effective contribution of the bosons at frequency of @xmath121 ( which is of order 100 khz ) was found to be the key to understand the decoherence .",
    "this low frequency nature of the reservoir bosons compared to the spontaneous emission transition frequencies ( which are of order ghz ) and population decay transition frequencies ( which is of order 10 mhz ) suggests that the reservoir may be regarded to be at non - zero temperature .",
    "if we assume the high temperature limit and certain density of states of the reservoir bosons , the decay rate coincides with that seen in the experiment @xcite .    to proceed further and investigate the origin of decoherence for the boulder ion trap experiment @xcite , we would have to know a number of parameters :    1 .",
    "the intensity fluctuations of the dye laser used for the stimulated raman transition which seems to be order of @xmath192-@xmath193 hz , so this may well be a candidate for the fluctuation affecting the bosons .",
    "but we would need to know more about the frequency dependence of the intensity fluctuation around 100 khz to take the analysis much further .",
    "2 .   noise from the trap potential from the radio frequency ( 100 - 200 khz ) radiation field is possible , but again we would need to estimate the density of states for this case to be more precise .",
    "3 .   possibility of quantum noise ( noise at finite @xmath11 ) remains a potential candidate to explain this decoherence .",
    "we defer further consideration of all these until the underlying parameters are better understood . since this paper was submitted for publication we learnt of related work by schneider and milburn @xcite , and by james @xcite .",
