    "graphene , the first strictly two - dimensional crystal , has been extensively studied , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "this enormous interest in graphene results mainly from peculiar transport properties , which follow from its very specific electronic structure .",
    "thermal and thermoelectric properties of graphene have become a topical issue since the first measurement of thermal conductivity in graphene by balandin _",
    "et al_.  @xcite it is known that graphene is one of the best heat conductors , with a very high thermal conductivity that is a consequence of the strong @xmath3 bonding , light atomic mass , and low dimensionality .",
    "@xcite a giant thermoelectric effect in graphene was also predicted theoretically ,  @xcite with the seebeck coefficient equal to 30 mv / k .",
    "impurities can substantially influence graphene s energy spectrum , so the thermoelectric transport strongly depends not only on the thermal activation but also on the impurity scattering .",
    "the influence of impurity scattering on the thermoelectric properties of graphene was considered theoretically using a self - consistent t - matrix approach by lofwander _",
    "et al_.@xcite from these considerations follows that the measured thermopower can be used to get some information on the role of impurity scattering in graphene .",
    "the thermopower near the dirac point was considered by wang _",
    "et al_,@xcite who obtained a relatively good agreement between experimental data and theoretical results based on the boltzmann transport theory .",
    "these authors also showed that the mott s relation fails in the vicinity of the dirac points in the case of high - mobility graphene , being however satisfied for a wide range of gate voltages in the regime of low carrier mobility .",
    "the thermoelectric transport in graphene was also considered for dirac fermions in the presence of magnetic field and disorder  @xcite .",
    "sharapov _ et al _  @xcite have found that the thermopower can be remarkably enhanced by opening an energy gap in the quasiparticle spectrum of graphene .",
    "the presence of energy gap is accompanied by the emergence of quasiparticle scattering channel , with the relaxation time strongly dependent on energy .",
    "the thermoelectric effects ware also investigated in multilayer graphene systems .",
    "the thermopower of biased and unbiased multilayer graphene was studied in the slonczewski - weis - mcclure model , where the effect of impurity scattering was treated in the self - consistent born approximation@xcite .",
    "the classic and spin seebeck effects in single as well as in multilayer graphene on the sic substrate were also investigated within ab - initio methods ,  @xcite and by nonequilibrium molecular - dynamics simulations .",
    "@xcite    transport properties of graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) can differ from the corresponding ones of a two - dimensional graphene plane , mainly due to edge sates and energy gaps which develop in the electronic spectrum .",
    "these transport properties also depend on the edge shape .",
    "thermoelectric properties of gnrs have also been investigated and it has been shown that thermopower in gnrs can be remarkably larger than that in the planar graphene.@xcite moreover , the corresponding figure of merit , @xmath1 , can be enhanced by introducing randomly distributed hydrogen vacancies into completely hydrogenated gnrs.@xcite structural defects , especially in the form of antidots , were also shown to be a promising way of enhancing thermoelectric efficiency in gnrs.@xcite    in this paper we consider thermoelectric properties of a two - dimensional graphene with impurities which lead to resonant states near the fermi level . we show that the resonant states result in resonant enhancement of the seebeck coefficient .",
    "this enhancement can be observed when the fermi level is tuned by an external gate voltage . in section 2",
    "we describe the model and theoretical method used to calculate the seebeck coefficient . the relaxation time is calculated in section 3 .",

    "strong energy dependence of the relaxation time and the presence of resonance states , lead to a significant dependence of the ratio @xmath100 on the chemical potential @xmath89 , as shown in fig .  4 for @xmath87  k and indicated values of the scattering potential @xmath56 .",

    "the corresponding ratio @xmath105 is shown in figure 4 .",
    "when the chemical level is well inside the valence or conduction bands , @xmath106 , the ratio @xmath100 tends to the lorentz number @xmath103 , as in the case of resonance states .",

    "in other words , we assume that one can neglect the dependence of @xmath107 on energy , @xmath108 for @xmath109 , which is certainly fulfilled at rather low temperatures for any dependence @xmath29 .",
    "in such a case , the kinetic coefficient @xmath110 , and the other coefficients can be calculated analytically @xmath111 using eq.(21 ) and eq.(22 ) , one can calculate the lorentz number for graphene at @xmath2 , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the riemann s @xmath114-function .",

    "these impurities lead to resonance impurity states near the fermi level , and therefore to resonance electron scattering . in agrement with the mott s law , the magnitude of the seebeck coefficient @xmath46 and shape of its dependence on the chemical potential is strongly affected by the dependence of the conductivity on @xmath20 , which in turn is determined mainly by the electron scattering from impurities in the vicinity of resonance states",
    ". the resonant states also lead to significant enhancement of the figure of merit @xmath1 .",
    "we have also shown that the ratio @xmath100 deviates from the lorentz number @xmath103 , and this deviation appears for chemical potentials in the vicinity of the resonant states . moreover , assuming a constant relaxation time we have found analytical solution for the ratio @xmath100 at @xmath119 , which agrees with that derived earlier .    in our calculations",
