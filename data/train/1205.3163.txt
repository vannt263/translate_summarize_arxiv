    "this is true for idealized , dark matter only halos , but in real objects the impact of baryon physics is strong , in particular in the inner regions . indeed , even if the icm is described by a cored @xmath10-model profile , in the central region it tends to cool and to form stars , which accumulate in the core of the cluster , thus increasing the total concentration .",
    "moreover , it is supposed that this baryon contraction does also affect the dark matter component , through an adiabatic contraction effect , leading thus to an increase of the dark matter concentration .",
    "the adiabatic contraction model has been described in @xcite and @xcite , but , for an updated treatment , see also @xcite .",

    "* ) .    since the concentration of a halo",
    "is linked to the background density of the universe at the time it collapsed , and since different dark energy models predict different evolutions of the cosmological background , it is interesting to investigate the impact of dark energy on the @xmath0 relation . moreover , since some dark energy models can also affect the linear and non linear evolution of the density fluctuations , leaving some imprints in collapsed structure , one can think about using the @xmath0 relation as a cosmological probe , orthogonal to others that are commonly used .",

    "we consider the same cosmological models discussed in paper i. here we recall only the main features of the different models , and refer to paper i for more details .    as a reference model",
    "we use the concordance @xmath1cdm model , adapted to the wmap3 values @xcite , with the following cosmological parameters :    * matter density : @xmath15 * dark energy density : @xmath16 * baryon density : @xmath17 * hubble parameter : @xmath18 * power spectrum normalization : @xmath19 * spectral index : @xmath20    this model is characterized by the presence of a dark energy component given by a cosmological constant @xmath1 , with a constant @xmath21 .",
    "the second case is a model with dynamical dark energy , given by a quintessence scalar field @xmath22 with an equation of state @xmath23 @xcite . as in paper",

    "the third possibility we consider is the case in which @xmath22 interacts non minimally with gravity @xcite .",

    "that is to say @xmath36 , the latter expression becomes    @xmath37    which manifestly depends on the sign of the coupling @xmath28 .",
    "we note that , since the derivative of the rp potential in equation ( [ rp_potential ] ) with respect to @xmath22 is @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 .",

    ", the linear density contrast of a top - hat spherical collapse model , @xmath41 , converges to the einstein - de sitter value @xmath42 at high redshift , but it is lower than the einstein - de sitter value at low redshift due to the presence of the cosmological constant which starts to dominate . for minimally coupled and extended quintessence models , the value of @xmath41 at low redshift is lower than the @xmath1cdm one , depending on the model . in any case , at @xmath5 these differences are very small , well below @xmath43 . for an extensive treatment of eq models see pace et al .",

    "+ we trimmed the parameters of the four dynamical dark energy models in such a way that @xmath44 is the highest value still consistent with present observational constraints in order to amplify the effects of dark energy .",
    "the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are the same for all models , but since we normalize the power spectrum to cmb data from wmap3 , this leads to different values of @xmath14 for the different cosmologies :    @xmath50    assuming @xmath51 , where the growth factor @xmath52 is normalized to unity today . in principle , in eq models there",
    "could be a scale - dependent linear growth rate which is neglected in equation ( [ sigmade ] ) . given the values of the coupling , we do expect this dependence to be small .",

    ".parameters for the different cosmological models : @xmath53 is the exponent of the inverse power - law potential ; @xmath28 is the coupling in the extended quintessence models ; @xmath54 is the present value of the equation of state parameter for dark energy ; @xmath14 is the normalization of the power spectrum . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab_normalization ]    finally , we compare the concentrations obtained from the dark matter only runs with the one obtained from the hydrodynamical runs .",
    "we do this by taking the ratio between @xmath55 and @xmath56 in each mass bin both for the complete and relaxed samples at @xmath5 .",
    "we plot the results in fig .",
    "[ cdm_vs_ctot ] . in the left panel",
    "we analyse the ratio for the complete sample .",
    "we see that all cosmological models have @xmath57 increasing with increasing mass .",
    "this fact confirms that the baryon physics , as treated in these numerical runs , influences more the concentration of high - mass objects compared to low - mass ones ( see also fig .",
    "[ dm_vs_tot_comparison ] ) .",
    "in particular , while @xmath1cdm , rp and sugra have @xmath58 in some low - mass bins , eqp and eqn have in general @xmath59 , with a less pronounced evolution with mass . in the right panel",
    "we analyse the ratio for the relaxed sample . here",
    "the situation is a bit different .",
    "all the cosmological models still show a general increase of @xmath57 with increasing mass , but the evolution is rather shallow .",
    "in particular , very massive objects in the rp , eqp and eqn models have low values of these ratio . in any case , with few exceptions in some mass bins , we generally find that @xmath59 for all models .",
    "this analysis indicates that the inclusion of baryon physics in the simulations is unable to solve the discrepancy between the predicted and observed @xmath0 relation by increasing the slope .",
    "indeed , in none of the cases we have analysed , the effect of the baryons is to increase the concentration of low - mass objects without affecting the one of the high - mass ones .",
    "of course a possible explanation of this fact can be that we do not include some kinds of feedback in our simulations , in particular agn feedback .",
    "still , @xcite already showed that none of the different hydrodynamical treatments they tried was able to both explain the observed @xmath0 relation and the stellar fraction in galaxy clusters .",
    "nevertheless , we have seen that different dark energy models leave an imprint in the @xmath0 relation . in particular , as already noted by , in ordinary quintessence models , like our rp and sugra , the normalization of this relation compared to the @xmath1cdm one is driven by the value of @xmath60 with respect to the value for @xmath1cdm .",
    "we find that the same thing is no longer valid for extended quintessence models like our eqp and eqn . indeed , in these cases we find that , in presence of a positive coupling , the value of the normalization is lower than what expected from @xmath60 while in presence of a negative coupling it is increased .",
    "we interpret this behaviour as due to the different redshift evolution of the effective gravitational interaction @xmath61 , as explained in sect .",
    "[ models ] .",
    "unfortunately , given the discrepancies between the observed and the predicted @xmath0 relation , it is difficult to use the observed @xmath0 relation to disentangle different cosmological models through the imprints left by dark energy .",
    "in this paper we studied the @xmath0 relation for the halos extracted from the simulation set introduced in paper i. from our analysis we draw the following conclusions .",
    "* concentration : the definition itself of the concentration of a halo can lead to very different results . for the reference @xmath1cdm model at @xmath5 , we see that the usual fit of a nfw profile , depending on the way in which the errors are weighted and the concentration is evaluated from the fit , gives values of the concentration with differences , at worst , of the order of @xmath62 .",
    "the method using @xmath63 discussed in @xcite , instead , returns similar values of the concentration only for super - relaxed objects , while in general gives higher values of the concentration , up to @xmath2 .",
    "the quantity @xmath64 , which is model independent , is found to be well correlated with the nfw value of the concentration for dark matter only simulations , indicating that on average dark matter halos are indeed well described by a nfw profile . in a given mass bin , the mean concentration is higher and the intrinsic scatter is lower for objects that are in a relaxed dynamical state and well described by a nfw profile .",
    "halos extracted from the hydrodynamical runs have , in general , higher concentrations than their dark matter only counterparts .",
    "the effect is more evident in high - mass systems , due to a higher baryon fraction in the inner regions . * @xmath0 relation : limiting our analysis to the @xmath1cdm model , there is a large intrinsic scatter in the values of the concentration for objects of a given mass , ranging from @xmath65 up to @xmath66 depending on mass and dynamical state .",
    "nevertheless , if we consider the mean value of concentration in a given mass range , there is a good correlation between concentration and mass .",
    "the concentration is slightly decreasing with increasing mass , and this relation is well described by a power - law , with two free parameters , the normalization and the slope .",
    "the normalization , that we define as the value of the concentration of a halo with a mass of @xmath67 , is increasing going from @xmath68 for the complete sample to @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the relaxed and super - relaxed samples , respectively .",
    "the slope is similar for the different samples considered and is @xmath71 . in general",
    ", we find a good agreement with the results from other works in literature .",
    "the normalization is higher by @xmath72 for objects extracted from the hydrodynamical runs compared to the one of the dark matter only runs .",
    "the slope is flatter by @xmath73 for the hydrodynamical simulations than for the dark matter only ones .",
    "this is expected because massive objects from the hydrodynamical simulations have higher concentrations than their dark matter only counterparts .",
    "* redshift dependence : the @xmath0 relation shows an evolution with redshift , with concentration decreasing with increasing redshift as @xmath74 . for the @xmath1cdm model ,",
    "considering also objects at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the redshift evolution is more pronounced for the dark matter only simulations than for the hydrodynamical ones , while it is similar for the complete and relaxed samples .",
    "* dark energy models : we find that the normalization of the @xmath0 relation in dynamical dark energy cosmologies is different with respect to the @xmath1cdm one , while the slopes are more compatible",
    ". in particular , at @xmath5 , the differences in the normalizations for rp and sugra when compared to @xmath1cdm reflect the differences in @xmath77 , with models having a higher @xmath77 also having a higher normalization .",
    "this simple scheme is not valid for the eqp and eqn scenarios . in the former case ,",
    "the normalization is lower than expected considering @xmath3 , while in the latter it is higher , and indeed eqn is always the model with the highest normalization , regardless of the dynamical state of the objects or the runs they are extracted from .",
    "this behaviour is due to the different redshift evolution of the effective gravitational interaction @xmath61 in these models . indeed , going from high to low redshift , @xmath61 decreases ( increases ) for eqp ( eqn ) toward the value for @xmath1cdm and ordinary quintessence models , thus decreasing ( increasing ) the concentration of the halos .",
    "this is a very important result because it shows a direct manifestation of the coupling between gravity and the quintessence scalar field . for objects extracted from the hydrodynamical",
    "runs , we also study the redshift evolution of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "we find different evolution for different dark energy models , with values of @xmath78 ranging between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath1cdm has the strongest evolution , while sugra has the weakest , while rp lies in between .",
    "for these three models , the behaviour is similar for the complete and relaxed samples .",
    "eqp and eqn models , instead , show an evolution similar to @xmath1cdm for the complete sample and similar to rp for the relaxed sample .",
    "it is interesting to note that at @xmath5 the normalization decreases from @xmath1cdm to rp to sugra , while at @xmath76 the situation is completely reversed , indicating a stronger redshift evolution in sugra with respect to @xmath1cdm .",
    "independently of redshift , eqp has always the lowest normalization while eqn has always the highest , meaning that the effect of the coupling between gravity and the quintessence scalar field is important also at higher redshift .",
