    "it is well known that the canonical ( or type - i ) seesaw mechanism  @xcite can be generalized to a type - iii variant  @xcite .",
    "recently ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that a quintuplet variant also exists .",
    "actually , these are the only three possibilities for a minimal tree - level seesaw due to heavy fermion exchange when lepton - number symmetry is broken by a single ( majorana ) mass insertion  @xcite .",
    "the inverse seesaw mechanism , on the other hand , provides an interesting alternative to the conventional seesaws  @xcite .",
    "this approach requires an increased field content , but has the advantage of lowering the mass scale for the new physics , making it eminently more testable .",
    "the majority of works that have thus far studied the inverse seesaw have employed what could be called a standard , or type - i , inverse seesaw . in this work",
    "we show that the inverse seesaw mechanism can be generalized to a type - iii variant , and a quintuplet variant , in complete analogy with the conventional seesaw .",
    "these results fill some gaps in the literature and further map the  theory space \" for neutrino mass models .",
    "as we shall see , the type - iii inverse seesaw employs a real fermion triplet and turns out to be a very simple generalization .",
    "it does not require any additional parameters or multiplets , relative to the standard inverse seesaw , and yet retains the appealing features of the standard approach .",
    "as best we can tell , there appears to be no reason to preference the standard inverse seesaw over this variant .",
    "the quintuplet inverse seesaw requires an additional scalar but otherwise operates much the same as the conventional version .",
    "it has some interesting phenomenological differences , however .",
    "beyond these two generalizations , we find that further minimal variants with larger fermion multiplets are not as interesting due to the absence of a natural explanation for a requisite small vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .    before proceeding we note that the small lepton number violating masses found in inverse seesaws can be radiatively induced in the so called  radiative inverse seesaws \"  @xcite .",
    "the lhc phenomenology of the triplet fermion employed in the type - iii seesaw is detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for recent works relating neutrino masses to the existence of larger fermion representations see refs .",
    "@xcite , while some bounds on large scalar multiplets are detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . also note that for simplicity we present our discussion for a single generation , though all results are easily generalized .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : inverse_seesaw ]",
    "we provide a brief overview of the inverse seesaw mechanism , reminding readers of features relevant to our subsequent discussion .",
    "section  [ sec : general_inverse_seesaw ] describes the basic logic that guides our generalization process , and presents the simplest ( type - iii ) generalization .",
    "we move beyond the simplest generalization in section  [ sec : non - minimal_inverse_seesaw ] to arrive at a quintuplet inverse seesaw .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the sm can be extended to realize an inverse seesaw mechanism by adding a vector - like gauge - singlet fermion , @xmath6 , to the particle spectrum .",
    "the lagrangian then contains the terms & & i|n^_n - m|n n -n_r -n_l -|l n_r+ . here @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the sm lepton ( scalar ) doublet , and the tilde denotes charge conjugation .",
    "gauge invariance also permits a term @xmath9 , however a field redefinition can be performed to rotate this term away .",
    "one can therefore set this term to zero without loss of generality .",
    "lepton number symmetry is explicitly broken by the bare majorana masses @xmath10 , which are consistent with gauge invariance .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking the sm neutrino @xmath11 mixes with the singlet fermion . in the basis @xmath12 , the full neutral lepton mass matrix is given by _",
    "= (    ccc 0 & m_d & 0 + m_d & _ r & m + 0&m&_l    ) , [ eq : inv_seesaw_mass_matrix ] where the dirac mass is @xmath13 .",
    "the inverse seesaw mechanism occurs in the technically - natural limit of @xmath14 , for which the eigenvalues are m_&= & + ( ^2 ) , [ eqn : evals_1 ] + m_2,3 & = & + + + ( ^2).[eqn : evals_23 ] observe that the light neutrino mass ( i.e. @xmath15 ) is suppressed due to the smallness of @xmath16 , with further suppression occurring for @xmath17",
    ".    an interesting feature of the inverse seesaw is that it permits significant mixing between @xmath11 and @xmath18 , namely @xmath19 .",
    "we can write this as & ~ &  ~  10 ^ -2 ( ) ( ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath20  tev and @xmath21 the mixing is @xmath22 and non - unitary mixing effects may be observable in future experiments  @xcite . of course , the light neutrino mass is naturally small even if these new effects are not within experimental reach , though new observable phenomenology would certainly be welcome .",
    "also note that the mixing between @xmath11 and @xmath23 is at the level of @xmath24 and remains negligible .. ]",
    "the inverse seesaw mechanism described in the previous section can be reduced to the following ( generalized ) elements :    * the sm is extended to include a real vector - like fermion : @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 must be odd to ensure @xmath27 contains a neutral component . * the new fermion yukawa - couples to the sm lepton doublet , @xmath28 , where the scalar @xmath29 transforms as @xmath30 . *",
    "the quantum numbers of the scalar should satisfy @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "* lepton number symmetry is broken explicitly by bare majorana mass terms for the chiral components of @xmath27 .",
    "reducing the inverse seesaw to these basic ingredients makes it apparent that simple generalizations are possible .",
    "indeed , a generic tree - level diagram for a generalized inverse seesaw can be drawn ; see figure  [ fig : general_inverse ] .",
    "minimal realizations of the inverse seesaw occur when @xmath33 is the sm scalar , as no new scalars are required .",
    "however , the fermion @xmath27 is a beyond - sm field and the use of the gauge - singlet field @xmath34 is not the only possibility , as we now show .",
    "the simplest generalization of the inverse seesaw arises when one retains @xmath35 but employs a fermion with @xmath36 .",
    "the only such candidate compatible with gauge invariance is the real fermion triplet @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , this is a particularly simple generalization that retains all the appealing features of the ( standard ) inverse seesaw .",
    "the lagrangian contains the terms & & i|^d_- m| -_r -_l -|l _ r+,[eq : type_iii_lagrangian ] and once again a field redefinition is performed , without loss of generality , to remove the term @xmath37 .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking there is mass mixing between the sm neutrino @xmath11 and the new neutral fermions .",
    "we again label this dirac mass as @xmath38 , and write the neutral - fermion mass matrix as _ = (",
    "ccc 0 & m_d & 0 + m_d & _ r & m + 0&m&_l    ) , [ eq : type_3_mass_matrix ] in the basis @xmath39 .",
    "this has the same form as the inverse seesaw mass matrix in eq .  .",
    "thus , it is apparent that the mass eigenvalues have the same form as eqs .   and  .",
    "this model provides a technically natural explanation for the small neutrino masses observed in nature , on par with the standard inverse seesaw . note",
    "that this generalization is no more complicated than the standard realization ; relative to the inverse seesaw no additional particle multiplets are required and the number of new parameters is the same . from a bottom - up perspective we see no particular reason to favor the minimal ( or type - i ) inverse seesaw relative to this triplet version . in analogy with the type - iii seesaw  @xcite , one can refer to this generalization as a type - iii inverse seesaw .",
    "also note that , as with the standard incarnation , when the new fermion is at the tev scale ( @xmath20  tev ) one can obtain observable non - unitary mixing effects .",
    "we note that related inverse seesaws , with triplet leptons , have appeared in the literature .",
    "@xcite , in which low - energy phenomenological effects from effective operators with dimension @xmath40 ( related to the origin of neutrino mass ) are rigorously studied , also mentions triplet leptons in relation to the inverse seesaw",
    "@xcite also employ hypercharge - less triplet leptons and realize neutrino mass via non - standard inverse seesaws .",
    "these works differ from the approach discussed here , however , as they all contain beyond - sm symmetries , under which the triplets have non - trivial charges .",
    "thus , the set of bare triplet - mass terms shown in eq .",
    "[ and employed in eq .  ] are not allowed in these works , and an extended field content is required to generate neutrino mass via an inverse seesaw .",
    "triplet leptons were employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , though the mass matrix used there differs from the most general one shown in eq .",
    ", as they ignore the ( allowed ) majorana mass @xmath41 . ref .",
    "@xcite does , however , consider the collider phenomenology of the heavy ( pseudo- ) dirac neutral - fermions contained in the vector - like triplet .",
    "interestingly they find that the neutral fermion is readily distinguished from its majorana counterpart in the type - iii seesaw . in both cases ,",
    "final states with as many as six leptons are discussed .",
    "they find that , in the dirac case , like - sign dilepton signals ( @xmath42 ) are less significant , while three - lepton signals ( @xmath43 ) and four - lepton signals ( @xmath44 ) have a sizable ( and similar ) significance .",
    "this differs from the majorana case where the four - lepton signal is smaller while the two- and three - lepton signals have a similar significance .",
    "the vector - like triplet leptons can therefore be readily discriminated from their majorana counterpart by neutral - fermion production at the lhc .    before moving on to consider other fermionic representations",
    ", we note that one can also use the scalar @xmath2 in conjunction with the triplet fermions to realize an inverse seesaw .",
    "this scalar has an allowed renormalizable coupling of the form @xmath45 , and can therefore play the role of the external legs shown in figure  [ fig : general_inverse ] .",
    "however , the doublet contribution will also be present , so this would only produce a modification of the type - iii inverse seesaw already described ; viable neutrino masses would not depend on the presence or absence of the quadruplet scalar . similarly ,",
    "if one considers an extra sm - like doublet , this would not be needed to generate neutrino mass , and the resulting model would simply be a more cumbersome variant of the minimal scenario described here .",
    "the minimal inverse seesaws , described above , arise when one employs a fermion @xmath46 with @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "however , one can move beyond these minimal implementations and ask if further variations are possible for @xmath49 .",
    "the next simplest choice is @xmath50 , giving a fermion quintuplet @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the sm scalar is no longer sufficient to generate the yukawa coupling between the lepton doublet @xmath7 and the new fermion .",
    "the minimal choice for a new scalar is @xmath2 , which gives the new lagrangian terms & & i|^d_- m| -_r -_l -|l _",
    "note the new quartic term in the scalar potential .",
    "this term , linear in @xmath29 , forces @xmath29 to develop a nonzero vev after the sm scalar triggers electroweak symmetry breaking : s & & _ s , [ eq : new_vev ] where @xmath51 is the mass term for @xmath29 . observe that this vev is naturally suppressed , relative to the weak scale , for @xmath52 .",
    "this feature is important as the new scalar contributes to electroweak symmetry breaking and to the sm gauge boson masses . in particular",
    ", it modifies the tree - level value of the @xmath53-parameter away from the sm prediction of @xmath54 .",
    "experimental constraints require @xmath55  gev  @xcite which is readily obtained , without fine tuning , due to the inverse dependence of the scalar mass in eq .  .",
    "beyond these initial differences , this model is actually very similar to a standard inverse seesaw .",
    "the mass matrix again has the form of eq .  , but now the dirac mass coupling the sm neutrino to the new fermion is given by @xmath56 . for ease of exposition ,",
    "let us redisplay the mass eigenvalues m_&= & + ( ^2 ) ~_l , [ eqn : evals_1_nonminimal ] + m_2,3 & = & + ( ) ~m,[eqn : evals_23_nonminimal ] which have the same form as the minimal cases of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , modulo the replacement @xmath57 .",
    "this difference has an important consequence ;    noting that the mixing between @xmath11 and @xmath58 is @xmath59 , one obtains & ~ &  ~  10 ^ -2 ( ) ( ) ( ) .",
    "thus , for given fixed values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the mixing in the quintuplet model is suppressed by a factor of @xmath62 relative to the triplet model .",
    "however , we note that for @xmath20  tev and @xmath63  gev this mixing is at the level of @xmath64 for @xmath65 , which is more difficult to experimentally probe , though not beyond conceivable experimental reach .",
    "certainly , non - unitary mixing effects remain much easier to observe in the quintuplet model compared to the standard type - i and type - iii seesaws .",
    "the triplet and quintuplet models also contain additional charged fermions that enable one to differentiate between the models .",
    "note that an interesting seesaw model employing a chiral fermion quintuplet , @xmath66 , and the beyond - sm scalar @xmath2 , was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ( also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . despite the similar particle content , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is very different from the present model .",
    "ref  @xcite achieves neutrino masses with the ( generalized ) seesaw form @xmath67 , whereas we obtain the generalized inverse seesaw form of @xmath68 . actually , this difference is easy to explain ; the relationship between the model of ref .",
    "@xcite and the present model is completely analogous to the difference between a type - i seesaw  @xcite , in which the sm is extended by the addition of a chiral gauge - singlet field , and the standard inverse seesaw , in which a vector - like singlet is introduced . in the former case",
    "the light neutrino mass has the form @xmath69 , while in the inverse seesaw one has @xmath70 , the difference between which is completely analogous to that of the two quintuplet fermion models . is a type-@xmath26 seesaw . ]",
    "this relationship between neutrino masses in the standard seesaws and the analogous inverse seesaws is summarized in table  [ seesaws ] , with yukawa couplings set to unity for simplicity .",
    "@xcite considered some phenomenological aspects of the majorana quintuplet fermion employed in the quintuplet seesaw . as we noted in the triplet - fermion case ,",
    "the difference between the heavy majorana - fermion in a type - iii seesaw and the heavy pseudo - dirac fermion in the type - iii inverse seesaw is experimentally discernible  @xcite .",
    "the different signals in these cases can be traced back to the majorana vs. dirac nature of the neutral fermion .",
    "this difference also exists between the heavy neutral fermion in the quintuplet seesaw of ref .",
    "@xcite and the inverse variant presented here ; in the inverse seesaw the heavy fermion is dirac - like and thus some final states containing leptons will have a different relative significance compared to the majorana case . of course , the doubly - charged fermions in the quintuplet models will likely give more pronounced signals , but the different signals from neutral - fermion production can help discriminate the models .",
    ".[seesaws ] conventional seesaws and the corresponding inverse seesaws . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the context of the present work it is natural to ask if further generalizations of the inverse seesaw are possible .",
    "moving beyond the quintuplet with @xmath50 , the next possibility is @xmath71 . in this case",
    "the sm must also be extended to include a new scalar with the quantum numbers @xmath72 or @xmath73 . while one can consider such an extension , and realize an inverse seesaw mass of the form @xmath74 , this model is less desirable . as in the quintuplet model ,",
    "the vev of the new scalar is bound by @xmath53-parameter measurements to roughly obey @xmath55  gev . however , unlike the quintuplet model , the quantum numbers of the candidate new scalars do not permit a term linear in @xmath29 in the scalar potential @xmath75 .",
    "therefore the new scalar does not develop an induced vev after electroweak symmetry breaking ; one must instead engineer the relation @xmath76 by tuning parameters in the scalar potential .",
    "small neutrino masses therefore require some tuning in this case , if they are to be consistent with electroweak precision constraints ; if we restrict our attention to natural generalizations of the inverse seesaw we can disregard this model . do not allow a generalized version of the vev suppression found in the type - ii seesaw . ]",
    "the above statements also hold for even larger fermion multiplets ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the requisite scalar multiplets remain too large to allow a naturally small vev , and some tuning is necessary to achieve light sm neutrino masses and satisfy electroweak precision constraints .",
    "furthermore , the above considerations also apply if one employs the quintuplet fermion in concert with @xmath72 .",
    "this is the reason we did not discuss this possibility above , and instead restricted our attention to the case with @xmath2 when @xmath1 .",
    "finally , let us also point out that ref .",
    "@xcite has considered an inverse seesaw with a chiral fermion triplet @xmath78 .",
    "their approach differs from the minimal type - iii inverse seesaw presented in section  [ sec : general_inverse_seesaw ] ; they replace @xmath79 but retain @xmath18 and thus require the additional scalar @xmath80 to achieve a dirac coupling between @xmath81 and @xmath18 .",
    "this differs from our type - iii model with the vector - like triplet , in which no additional parameters or multiplets are required relative to the standard inverse seesaw .",
    "it should be apparent from our work that a number of generalizations are possible once one admits distinct chiral fermion multiplets , as in ref .",
    "for example , one could replace @xmath82 , along with the requisite scalars , and retain @xmath18 .",
    "alternatively one can generalize the inverse seesaw models so that two distinct external scalar legs appear in figure  [ fig : general_inverse ] , as was recently done for the type - iii seesaw in ref .",
    "these generalizations are , however , less minimal than the triplet and quintuplet inverse seesaws discussed here , in the sense that additional field - multiplets are required .",
    "we have studied generalized inverse seesaws in which the vector - like gauge - singlet neutrino of the standard inverse seesaw is replaced by a real vector - like fermion @xmath46 , with odd - valued @xmath26 .",
    "two interesting generalizations were found .",
    "the ( type - iii ) model with @xmath48 provides a particularly simple generalization as it does not require any additional parameters or multiplets relative to the standard inverse seesaw .",
    "indeed , from a bottom - up perspective there does not appear to be any reason to favor the standard inverse seesaw over this variant .",
    "the quintuplet model with @xmath50 also realizes a viable inverse seesaw , though non - unitary mixing effects are more difficult to observe in this variant . in minimal inverse seesaws with larger values of @xmath83 one requires some tuning to obtain small neutrino masses and remain consistent with electroweak precision constraints , making such cases less interesting .",
