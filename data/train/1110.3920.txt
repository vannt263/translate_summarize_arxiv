    "up to now the standard model ( sm ) managed to pass all the experimental challenges unscathed , providing an overall good description of particle physics up to the energy scales probed in experiments so far , namely hundreds of gev .",
    "the higgs boson , the last missing building block of the sm , is being searched for at the lhc experiments atlas and cms , which will be able to find or exclude it .    in spite of the phenomenological success , however , the sm is not satisfactory for several theoretical reasons , including the instability of the fundamental scale of weak interactions , the fermi scale , against radiative corrections , the absence of a dark matter candidate , an amount of cp violation too small to account for the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe , the lack of an explanation for the origin of flavor and cp violation and the non - unified description of the interactions , with gravity completely missing .    for these reasons ,",
    "the sm is regarded as a low - energy theory bound to fail at some energy scale larger than the fermi scale , where new physics ( np ) effects become important .",
    "the search for these effects beyond the sm is the main goal of particle physics in the next decades , both at present and future experimental facilities .",
    "the most straightforward way to search for np is producing and observing new particles in colliders . to this end",
    ", the key ingredient is the available center - of - mass energy : the higher the energy , the heavier the particles one can produce , thus probing higher np scales . pushing forward the energy frontier then means building colliders with higher and higher center - of - mass energy .",
    "the problem with direct searches is that their success depends on the unknown production thresholds of the new particles . some of the sm problems , however , have solutions , such as the natural stabilization of the fermi scale or the wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) as dark matter candidates , which point to np at the tev scale giving to the lhc good chances to discover it .    a complementary way to reveal np is measuring the effect of virtual heavy particle exchange in processes involving only sm particles as external states . for this kind of searches , called indirect ,",
    "the production threshold is not an issue .",
    "since quantum effects become typically smaller as the mass of the virtual particles increases , higher np scales are probed by increasing the precision of the measurements , controlling at same time the sm contributions with an accuracy sufficient to disentangle genuine np effects from sm uncertainties .",
    "progress at the intensity frontier entails building experimental facilities which can deliver high - intensity beams at energies where one can make a set of precision measurements not limited by systematic and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "flavor physics is the best candidate as a tool for indirect np searches for several reasons .",
    "flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , neutral meson - antimeson mixing and cp violation occur at the loop level in the sm and therefore are potentially subject to large virtual corrections from new heavy particles .",
    "in addition , flavor violation in the sm is governed by weak interactions and , in the case of quarks , suppressed by small mixing angles .",
    "these features are not necessarily shared by np which could then produce very large effects .    on quite general grounds",
    ", the indirect np search in flavor processes explores a parameter space including the np scale and the np flavor- and cp - violating couplings . in specific models ,",
    "these are related to fundamental parameters such as masses and couplings of new particles .",
    "in particular , an observable np effect could be generated by small np scales and/or large couplings .",
    "indeed the inclusion in the sm of generic np flavor - violating terms with @xmath0 couplings is known to violate present experimental constraints unless the np scale is pushed to large values , from @xmath1 to @xmath2 tev depending on the flavor sector , with the larger scales required by kaon physics  @xcite the difference between the np scale emerging from flavor physics when flavor couplings are not suppressed and the tev scale suggested by the solution of the sm problems mentioned above is usually referred to as the np flavor problem : np models with new particles at the tev scale need a mechanism to suppress np contributions to fcnc and cp - violating processes . on the other hand , this clearly indicates that flavor physics has either the potential to push the explored np scales well beyond the tev region or , if the np scale is indeed close to @xmath3 tev , that the np flavor structure is non - trivial , calling for the experimental determination of new flavor - violating couplings in order to elucidate the suppression mechanism at work .    in spite of its potential , so far flavor physics has not provided a clear np signal , although deviations with low significance are present here and there .",
    "this failure , however , should not be considered discouraging .",
    "broadly speaking , flavor physics probed and excluded only the region of small masses / large np flavor couplings . on the other hand",
    ", we should not forget that flavor physics already proved itself effective in predicting the existence and in some cases the mass of most of the heavy particles which are nowadays part of the sm .",
    "the list of these successes includes the prediction of the existence of the charm quark from the suppression of the rate @xmath4 in the early seventies  @xcite , the prediction of the existence of the third generation from the measurement of cp violation in @xmath5@xmath6 mixing , again in the seventies  @xcite and the indication of a heavy mass for the top quark from the measurements of the semileptonic @xmath7 decay rates and the @xmath7@xmath8 mass difference in the late eighties  @xcite .",
    "the lesson to be learned from this short historical excursus is that flavor physics can indeed provide very valuable information on unknown heavy particles and it is therefore worth pushing experiments and theory to higher precision in order to probe heavier particles and/or smaller flavor couplings .    in this paper",
    ", we give an overview of the physics opportunities opened by the next - generation flavor experiments , mainly the two approved super @xmath7-factories superb in italy and belle - ii / superkekb in japan .",
    "these are actually super flavor - factories , expected to produce precision measurements in @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 physics , increasing by two orders of magnitude the luminosity of their predecessors pep - ii and kekb .",
    "the two super - flavor factories are planned to start to take data in the second part of this decade and to collect more than 50 ab@xmath11 integrated luminosity by around 2020 .",
    "it has to be noted that by @xmath12 the lhcb experiment at lhc will collect the design integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath11 and an upgrade ( after 2020 ) is actually under study to considerably increase the collected data sample up to 50 fb@xmath11 .",
    "we begin with a brief primer on flavor and cp violation in the sm , introducing also the some common flavor observables , in section  [ sec : primer ] .",
    "we then summarize in section  [ sec : status ] the present knowledge of the sm flavor sector and point out some tensions which could be the harbingers of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the most interesting measurements in the physics programme of the next - generation flavor factories are reviewed in section  [ sec : opportunities ] , giving estimates of the expected statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the selection of these measurements is done taking into account the physics program which should have been already accomplished by lhcb . in section  [ sec : bsm ] , we discuss the impact of these measurements on a selection of np models in different scenarios , giving few examples of the potential implications of precision flavor physics .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we are particularly indebted with the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite , as many arguments and results presented in this review are based on their studies .",
    "in this section we briefly review the sm flavor structure , focusing mainly on the quark sector and collecting some basic formulae used throughout the review .",
    "the sm matter content is organized as follows : @xmath13 where the transformation properties under the gauge groups @xmath14 are indicated .",
    "the index @xmath15 spans the flavor space . in the sm with three generations",
    ", one has @xmath16 the subscripts @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the left - handed and right - handed components of the fields .",
    "the sm lagrangian can be written as @xmath19 in the absence of @xmath20 , the sm lagrangian is invariant under the global symmetry @xmath21 corresponding to the separate unitary rotation of each matter multiplet in flavor space .",
    "@xmath20 contains the yukawa interactions between the higgs doublet and the matter fields : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the higgs doublet transforming as @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath26 are @xmath27 complex matrices in flavor space ( the sum over the flavor indices @xmath28 is understood ) .",
    "the presence of non - vanishing yukawa couplings breaks this large group down to few @xmath29 factors , @xmath30 { } u(1)_b \\otimes u(1)_e \\otimes u(1)_\\mu \\otimes u(1)_\\tau\\,,\\ ] ] which account for the conservation of the barion and the three lepton numbers .",
    "they can be diagonalized using the singular value decomposition , giving @xmath31 where @xmath32 are four unitary matrices and @xmath33 are diagonal matrices with real non - negative matrix elements .",
    "therefore it is always possible to choose a flavor basis for the quark fields where , for example , @xmath34 @xmath35 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix  @xcite which contains all flavor non - diagonal couplings and the only cp - violating phase of the sm lagrangian ( notice however that the flavor symmetry is broken also by @xmath33 as long as the diagonal entries are different ) .",
    "clearly @xmath36 originates from the misalignment in flavor space of the components of the left - handed quark doublet .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , the yukawa interactions generate the fermion masses . replacing @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : y ] ) , one obtains @xmath38 one can go to the mass eigenstate basis , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are both diagonal , applying unitary flavor transformations to the quark fields , namely making the replacement @xmath41 where @xmath32 are the four unitary matrices defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : svd ] ) .",
    "the only leftover of these transformations in the sm lagrangian is the ckm matrix appearing in the charged current weak interactions @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath44 coupling constant .",
    "let us have a closer look at the ckm matrix @xmath36 .",
    "a generic @xmath27 unitary matrix can be represented using @xmath45 euler angles and @xmath46 phases , but @xmath47 of the latter can be removed by re - phasing the quark fields .",
    "therefore @xmath36 can be parameterized by @xmath45 angles @xmath48 $ ] and @xmath3 phase @xmath49 .",
    "notice that the choice of the paramters is not unique . in the parameterization used by the pdg  @xcite",
    ", the ckm matrix reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath36 implies @xmath61 conditions involving products of rows ( or columns ) of the form @xmath62 .",
    "the off - diagonal relations are called triangular as they define triangles in the complex plane .",
    "remarkably , the area of all these triangles is a constant equal to @xmath63 and thus a measure of cp violation in the sm .",
    "one of them , of particular phenomenological interest , is referred to as the unitarity triangle ( ut ) : @xmath64 the ut can be rewritten in the normalized form @xmath65 with @xmath66 being two sides and two angles as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : ut ] .",
    "the third side is the unity vector , while the third angle is @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , it is useful to define the angle @xmath68 from the triangle @xmath69 , as the phase of the @xmath70@xmath71 mixing amplitude is @xmath72 in the phase convention of eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "the ut sides and angles are observables and we discuss their present determination from @xmath5- and @xmath7-meson physics in section  [ sec : status ] .    given the definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ut ] ) , all the information related to the ut is encoded in one complex number @xmath73 corresponding to the coordinates @xmath74 in the complex plane of the only non - trivial apex of the ut .",
    "it is worth mentioning another popular ckm parameterization introduced by wolfenstein  @xcite which allows to write an expansion of the ckm matrix in terms of a small parameter @xmath75 : @xmath76 this parameterization makes explicit the hierarchy of ckm matrix elements , showing that quark flavor - changing transitions are suppressed in the sm .",
    "the exact relations between the pdg and the wolfenstein parameterizations are @xmath77 notice that @xmath78 ( the sine of the cabibbo angle @xmath79 ) is indeed a good expansion parameter .",
    "the relation between the ut apex coordinates and the wolfenstein parameters is @xmath80 showing that @xmath81 and @xmath82 at the lowest order in @xmath75 .    for massless neutrinos ,",
    "the sm lepton sector is flavor diagonal and cp conserving , as @xmath83 can be chosen real and diagonal .",
    "once the sm is trivially extended to include right - handed neutrinos and account for neutrino dirac masses , introducing an additional yukawa matrix @xmath84 , the formalism for lepton flavor and cp violation is similar to the quark one .",
    "the lepton mixing matrix , called the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix ,  @xcite , is parameterized much as the ckm matrix .",
    "the only difference is that the possibility of having majorana mass terms for neutrinos allows for two additional cp - violating phases . in spite of these formal similarities ,",
    "the flavor phenomenology of the lepton sector , in particular of neutrinos , is rather different from the quark one and its discussion goes beyond the scope of this primer .",
    "we just remind that , given the smallness of neutrino masses , charged lepton flavor violation is negligible in the sm .",
    "most of flavor physics deals with flavor - changing transitions involving mesons .",
    "as far as decays are concerned , cp violation appears as a difference between the rates of a decay and its cp - conjugate , accounted for by the direct cp asymmetry @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the decaying meson , @xmath87 is the final state , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the cp - conjugate states and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the two decay amplitudes .",
    "charged mesons can only violate cp in the decay .",
    "on the other hand , neutral mesons , with the exception of the pion , are subject to the mixing phenomenon , _",
    "i.e. _  the mass eigenstates are a superposition of the flavor ones . in this case",
    ", cp violation can also occur in the mixing itself and in the interference between mixing and decay , giving additional opportunities to observe it .",
    "we briefly summarize in the following the main formulae related to meson mixing and cp violation .",
    "the time evolution of a system of unstable neutral meson - antimeson states @xmath86@xmath88 can be described by a @xmath92 non - hermitean matrix hamiltonian @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath93 can be decomposed using the two hermitean matrices @xmath95 and @xmath96 representing its dispersive and absorbitive part respectively . in particular , assuming cpt invariance , one can write @xmath97 the eigenstates of @xmath93 , denoted as @xmath98 , can be written as @xmath99 where @xmath17 ( @xmath23 ) corresponds to the upper ( lower ) sign .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath100 giving the mass and width differences between the two eigenstates @xmath101 these observables , or the corresponding dimensionless variables @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 is the average lifetime ) , characterize the mixing .",
    "in addition , the absolute value @xmath105 is also observable .",
    "the deviation of @xmath105 from one is a measure of cp violation in the mixing , as shown by the expression of the semileptonic cp asymmetry  . for @xmath106 mesons ,",
    "the leptons in the final state are cp conjugated . ]",
    "@xmath107 depending on the meson , these formulae can be approximated in different ways .",
    "for @xmath7 mesons , where @xmath108 , one finds @xmath109 for the @xmath9 meson such simplification is not possible and the full expressions have to be used . besides , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dmdg ] ) only give the short - distance part of the corresponding observables , which contain large long - distance contributions . for kaons",
    ", the eigenstates are usually parameterized in terms of @xmath110 and different approximations hold , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for details on kaon mixing .",
    "finally , the third manifestation of cp violation in meson decays is through the interference between mixing and decay . the key observable in this case",
    "is the time - dependent cp asymmetry of a meson state @xmath111 decaying into a final state @xmath87 . taking a cp - eigenstate final state and up to @xmath112 corrections , the asymmetry is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 with @xmath115 @xmath116 is the @xmath86 mixing parameter and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) is the amplitude for @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) . the coefficient @xmath119 , the direct cp asymmetry defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : acpdir ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath120 , instead , is a new measurement of @xmath121 violation generated by the interference of mixing and decay amplitudes .",
    "time - dependent cp asymmetries for @xmath7 decays ( where @xmath122 ) give access to the ut angles . for example , as the amplitude for @xmath123 is dominated by a single term with a definite weak phase , one finds @xmath124 up to doubly cabibbo - suppressed corrections . in other cases ,",
    "the decay amplitude is not dominated by a single term and the extraction of the ut angles is less straightforward , as hadronic amplitudes no longer cancel in @xmath125 .",
    "previous formulae can also be generalized to non cp - eigenstate final states  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the present status of flavor physics in the sm , discussing the determination of the ckm parameters and possible deviations found in present data .",
    "the ckm matrix elements @xmath126 and @xmath127 can be measured from super - allowed @xmath128 decays  @xcite and semileptonic / leptonic kaon decays  @xcite respectively , determining accurately the sine of the cabibbo angle .",
    "the other ckm parameters are determined through a fit to the ut in eq .",

    "we have then presented some examples of flavor effects generated in a selection of np models which could be measurable in the future . in particular , we selected those correlations among observables which could provide a distinctive mark of the np model , showing how flavor physics could help telling it apart from the others",
