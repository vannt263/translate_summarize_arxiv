    "the presently studied tetrahedra systems fall into the rare case where both local and collective excitations can be observed simultaneously , and where the character of the excitation spectrum changes with minute changes of external parameters .    in the limit of weak coupling , i.e. in the quantum disordered phase , a set of gapped low energy excitations exists with energies characteristic for the intra - tetrahedra or -dimer couplings .",
    "such modes have been observed using different spectroscopic tools , e.g. in the frustrated dimer system @xmath32 @xcite . in the limit of strong inter - tetrahedra and weak intra - tetrahedra coupling long range ordering",

    "are observed as broadened two - particle continua with energies up to a few times the coupling constant .",
    "such a scattering contribution survives elevated temperatures with respect to its integrated intensity .",

    "theoretical modeling of two - particle raman scattering on spin tetrahedra systems showed symmetric continua only if the inter - tetrahedra couplings do not dominate , e.g. due to a coupling to chains of tetrahedra @xcite .",
    "in such models the determination of a mean energy of the continuum e@xmath29 is meaningful as its position is mainly determined by the strong intra - tetrahedra couplings .",

    "x = br , the system with the smallest inter - tetrahedra coupling , the strongly reduced ordered moment shows longitudinal fluctuations @xcite observed as a distinct longitudinal magnon mode at 18  @xmath20 ( refs . and ) .",
    "the energy separation of the continuum to this mode is of the order of the intra tetrahedra coupling @xcite and should be an indication for the proximity to a quantum critical point .",
    "in contrast , cu-2252 with x = cl and even more cu-45124 show splittings with considerably smaller energies @xmath30e . we propose two - spin anisotropies to be responsible for these effects as the weaker inter - tetrahedra coupling should lead to broader signals and single ion anisotropies do not exist for @xmath33 with s=1/2 . including dm interaction into the hamiltonian of srcu@xmath34(bo@xmath35)@xmath34 a very satisfactory description of raman modes and splittings of esr lines",
    "have been accomplished @xcite .",
    "for cu-2252 with x = br the field dependence of the longitudinal magnon and t@xmath31 has been modeled @xcite . within this approach",
    "we would expect a smaller contribution of the dm interaction as the normalized splitting is @xmath30e / e@xmath29=12.7 for cu-45124 compared to @xmath30e / e@xmath29=19 for cu-2252 with x = cl .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior of the low temperature susceptibility .",
    "the structural difference between the compounds discussed in chapter iv are summarized as a reduction of the inplane inter - tetrahedra coupling introducing additional [ te(1)o@xmath0 ] groups .",
    "the different stacking of the tetrahedra and the inversion center are expected to affect the out - of - plane exchange , however , only to a minor degree .",
    "the question remains which scenario dominates the spin fluctuations in cu-45124 irrespective of the exact ground state .",
    "is the dimensionality enhanced by a decreasing in - plane exchange with respect to out - of - plane exchange ? as a result the character of the transition should be more mean field - like . or does the same reduction of the in - plane exchange enhances the effect of frustration of the intra tetrahedra exchange ?",
    "although in cu-45124 the small number of low energy excitations might be taken as evidence for competing interactions , the reduced transition temperature while keeping the entropy constant proposes that the change of dimensionality is more effective for cu-45124 .",
    "noticeably , recent _ ab initio _ calculations on this new tellurate compound support the mean field nature of the magnetic behavior as observed experimentally @xcite .    neutron scattering experiments on cu-2252 show that a complex helical state with a reduced ordered moment can be used to describe the ordered state @xcite .",
    "inelastic scattering detects two kind of excitations , a dispersionless high energy mode at @xmath548  @xmath20 and a dispersing mode with a gap of @xmath516  @xmath20 .",
    "remarkably , for x = cl the dispersionless mode survives to elevated temperatures and is only moderately depressed for t@xmath37t@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "these observations support our results and we expect a similar trend for cu-45124 .",
    "further raman scattering and thermodynamic experiments are prepared to test whether controlled substitutions or pressure can be used to shift cu-45124 more closer to the quantum critical point similar to observations in cu-2252 @xcite .",
    "the compound cu-45124 has been established as the second example of a system with weakly interacting s=1/2 spin tetrahedra .",
    "results from raman scattering and thermodynamic experiments have been compared with the related compounds and discussed in terms of simple scaling arguments .",
