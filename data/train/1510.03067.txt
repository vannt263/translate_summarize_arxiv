    "the sacy ( search for associations containing young stars ) survey was a spectroscopic effort to find southern nearby associations using as targets the possible tycho2/hipparcos stars counterparts of the rosat all - sky bright sources catalogue ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . to analyze the sacy survey we developed a method to find young associations and to define their high probability members .",
    "these bonafide members enable to obtain the kinematical and the physical properties of each association in a proper way .",
    "recently we noted a concentration in the @xmath0 plane and we found a new association we are calling asya ( all sky young association ) for its overall distribution in the sky .",
    "we also search hipparcos catalogue for other possible members and we found a total of 38 bonafide members ( including those from hipparcos and sacy ) . although kinematically ( @xmath1 km / s ) near the her - lyr moving group , asya is definitively distinct from it and younger - we estimated an age of 110 myr , the oldest of the young associations found in the sacy survey .",
