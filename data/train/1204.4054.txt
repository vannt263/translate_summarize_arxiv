    "a _ clique _ in an undirected graph @xmath3 is a subset of vertices any two of which are connected by an edge .",
    "the cardinality of the maximum clique is called the _ clique number _ of @xmath3 .",
    "the problem of finding the maximum clique in an arbitrary graph is fundamental in theoretical computer science and appears in many different settings . as an example , consider a social network where vertices represent people and edges represent mutual acquaintance .",
    "finding a maximum clique in this network corresponds to finding the largest subset of people who all know each other .",
    "more generally , the analysis of large networks in order to identify communities , clusters , and other latent structure has come to the forefront of much research .",
    "the internet , social networks , bibliographic databases , energy distribution networks , and global networks of economies are some of the examples motivating the development of the field .",
    "it is well known that determining the clique number of an arbitrary graph is np - complete @xcite .",
    "in fact , the fastest algorithm known today runs in time @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath2 is the number of vertices in the graph .",
    "moreover , the best known approximation algorithm for the clique number has a performance guarantee of @xmath8 @xcite ( there are algorithms with better approximation ratios for graphs with large clique number ; see e.g. @xcite ) . even though this approximation ratio appears to be weak at first glance ,",
    "there are several results on hardness of approximation which suggest that there can be no approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio significantly less than linear ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that , if @xmath9 is the clique number , then the clique problem can not be solved in time @xmath10 , unless the exponential time hypothesis fails ( note that the brute force search algorithm runs in time @xmath11 , which seems quite close ) .",
    "the intractability of the maximum clique problem for arbitrary graphs lead researchers to the study of the problem for appropriately generated random graphs . in particular , for erds - rnyi random graphs @xmath12",
    "( i.e. random graphs in which each edge appears independently with probability @xmath13 ) , there are several greedy algorithms that find a clique of size about @xmath14 with high probability ( whp , i.e. with probability that tends to 1 as @xmath2 goes to infinity ) , see e.g. @xcite . since the clique number of @xmath12 is asymptotically equal to @xmath15 with high probability , these algorithms approximate the clique number by a factor of 2 .",
    "in fact , it was conjectured that finding a clique of size @xmath16 ( for a constant @xmath17 ) , with probability at least @xmath13 , would require techniques beyond the current limits of complexity theory .",
    "this belief was strengthened by the fact that the metropolis algorithm also fails to find the maximum clique in @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a more dramatized version of the above conjecture was presented in @xcite , stating that the problem of finding an @xmath18 clique remains hard even if the input graph is a @xmath12 random graph in which we have planted a randomly chosen clique of size @xmath19 .",
    "this conjecture has some interesting cryptographic consequences , as shown in @xcite .",
    "it also seems tight , since finding the maximum clique in the case where the planted clique has size at least @xmath20 can be done in polynomial time by using spectral properties of the adjacency matrix of the graph ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we finally note that there are quite a few nice results concerning generalizations of the planted clique problem in various ( quite general ) random graphs models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .      in this work , we complement the state of the art by relating the maximum clique problem to the intersection number of the input graph @xmath3 ( i.e. the minimum number of cliques that can edge cover @xmath3 ) .",
    "in particular , we consider the maximum clique problem for graphs with small intersection number and random intersection graphs .",
    "more analytically , we begin by considering arbitrary graphs with small intersection number .",
    "we present a simple algorithm which , on input @xmath3 finds a maximum clique in @xmath4 time steps , where @xmath0 is an upper bound on the intersection number of @xmath3 and @xmath2 is the number of vertices .",
    "consequently , when @xmath5 the running time of this algorithm is polynomial .",
    "we note here that computing the exact value of the independence number of @xmath3 is itself an np - complete problem , but this knowledge is only needed in the analysis of the algorithm .",
    "we then consider random instances of the random intersection graphs model ( introduced in @xcite ) as input graphs .",
    "in this model , denoted by @xmath21 , each one of @xmath0 labels is chosen independently with probability @xmath1 by each one of @xmath2 vertices , and there are edges between any vertices with overlaps in the labels chosen .",
    "random intersection graphs are relevant to and capture quite nicely social networking . indeed , a social network is a structure made of nodes ( individuals or organizations ) tied by one or more specific types of interdependency , such as values , visions , financial exchange , friends , conflicts , web links etc .",
    "social network analysis views social relationships in terms of nodes and ties .",
    "nodes are the individual actors within the networks and ties are the relationships between the actors .",
    "other applications include oblivious resource sharing in a ( general ) distributed setting , efficient and secure communication in sensor networks @xcite , interactions of mobile agents traversing the web etc .",
    "even epidemiological phenomena ( like spread of disease ) tend to be more accurately captured by this `` interaction - sensitive '' random graph model .    as our main contribution , we prove that , when the number of labels is not too large , we can use the label choices of the vertices to find a maximum clique in polynomial time ( in the number of labels @xmath0 and vertices @xmath2 of the graph ) .",
    "most of the work in this paper is devoted in proving our single label clique theorem ( theorem [ singlelabelclique ] in section [ sectionclique ] ) .",
    "our proof technique is original and employs a probabilistic contradiction argument .",
    "the theorem states that when the number of labels is less than the number of vertices , any large enough clique in a random instance of @xmath21 is formed by a single label .",
    "this statement may seem obvious when @xmath1 is small , but it is hard to imagine that it still holds for _ all _ `` interesting '' values for @xmath1 ( see also the discussion in section [ definitionsnotationrange ] ) .",
    "indeed , when @xmath22 , by slightly modifying an argument of @xcite , we can see that @xmath23 almost surely has no cycle of size @xmath24 whose edges are formed by @xmath9 distinct labels ( alternatively , the intersection graph produced by reversing the roles of labels and vertices is a tree ) . on the other hand , for larger @xmath1",
    "a random instance of @xmath21 is far from perfect and the techniques of @xcite do not apply ( for a more thorough discussion see the beginning of section [ sectionclique ] ) . by using the single label clique theorem",
    ", we provide a tight bound on the clique number of @xmath23 when @xmath25 . a lower bound in the special case where @xmath26 is constant , was given in @xcite .",
    "we considerably broaden this range of values to also include vanishing values for @xmath26 and also provide an asymptotically tight upper bound .",
    "we claim that our proof also applies for @xmath27 , provided @xmath1 is not too small .",
    "we should note here that in @xcite the authors prove the equivalence ( measured in terms of total variation distance ) of random intersection graphs and erds - rnyi random graphs , when @xmath28 .",
    "this bound on the number of labels was improved in @xcite , by showing equivalence of sharp threshold functions among the two models for @xmath29 . in view of these results",
    ", we expect that our work will shed light also in the problem of finding maximum cliques in erds - rnyi random graphs .    finally ,",
    "as yet another consequence of our single label clique theorem , we prove that the problem of inferring the complete information of label choices for each vertex from the resulting random intersection graph ( i.e. the _ label representation of the graph _ ) is _ solvable _ whp ; namely , the maximum likelihood estimation method will provide a unique solution ( up to permutations of the labels ) .",
    "is the set of different label choices that can give rise to a graph @xmath3 , then the problem of inferring the complete information of label choices from @xmath3 is _ solvable _ if there is some @xmath30 such that @xmath31 , for all @xmath32 . ] in particular , given values @xmath33 and @xmath1 , such that @xmath34 , and given a random instance of the @xmath21 model , the label choices for each vertex are uniquely defined .",
    "finding efficient algorithms for constructing such a label representation is left as an open problem for future research .      in section [ definitionsnotationrange ]",
    "we formally define random intersection graphs .",
    "we also provide some useful definitions and notation which are used throughout the paper .",
    "the relation of the intersection number to the clique number of an arbitrary graph is discussed in section [ aritrarymaxclique ] .",
    "section [ sectionclique ] is devoted to the proof of our single label clique theorem for random intersection graphs .",
    "the consequences of our main theorem concerning the efficient construction of a maximum clique and the uniqueness of the label representation of @xmath23 are presented in section [ labelreconstruction ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the presented results and further research in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the formal definition of the random intersection graphs model is as follows :    consider a universe @xmath35 of elements and a set of @xmath2 vertices @xmath36 .",
    "assign independently to each vertex @xmath37 a subset @xmath38 of @xmath39 , choosing each element @xmath40 independently with probability @xmath1 and draw an edge between two vertices @xmath41 if and only if @xmath42 .",
    "the resulting graph is an instance @xmath23 of the random intersection graphs model .    in this model",
    "we also denote by @xmath43 the set of vertices that have chosen label @xmath44 . given @xmath23 , we will refer to @xmath45 as its _",
    "label representation_. consider the bipartite graph with vertex set @xmath46 and edge set @xmath47 .",
    "we will refer to this graph as the _ bipartite random graph @xmath48 associated to @xmath23_. notice that the associated bipartite graph is uniquely defined by the label representation .",
    "it follows from the definition of the model that the edges in @xmath23 are not independent .",
    "in particular , the ( unconditioned ) probability that a specific edge exists is @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath26 goes to infinity with @xmath2 , then this probability goes to 1 . in the paper",
    ", we will thus consider the `` interesting '' range of values @xmath50 ( i.e. the range of values for which the unconditioned probability that an edge exists does not go to 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , as is usual in the literature , we will assume that the number of labels is some power of the number of vertices , i.e. @xmath51 , for some @xmath52 .",
    "the following definitions will also be useful :    the intersection number of a graph @xmath3 is the smallest number of cliques needed to cover all of the edges of @xmath3 .",
    "equivalently , the intersection number is the smallest number of elements in a representation of @xmath3 as an intersection graph of finite sets .    a set of cliques @xmath53 is an edge clique cover of a graph @xmath54",
    "if for every edge @xmath55 there is at least one clique @xmath56 such that @xmath57 and for every non edge @xmath58 , there is no such clique in @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the intersection number of @xmath3 is the minimum @xmath0 such that @xmath53 is an edge clique cover of @xmath3 .",
    "we use the convention that the random intersection graphs model is denoted by @xmath21 ( i.e. with a calligraph @xmath60 ) , while a specific random instance of the model is denoted by @xmath23 ( i.e. with a simple @xmath3 ) .    for a vertex @xmath37 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath61 the set of neighbors of @xmath62 in @xmath3 .",
    "we will say that two vertices @xmath63 belong to the same _ closed neighborhood in @xmath3 _ and we will write @xmath64 if and only if @xmath65 .",

    "furthermore , we use the relation `` @xmath70 '' for asymptotically equal .",
    "in particular , if @xmath71 are two functions of @xmath2 , then @xmath72 means that @xmath73 or equivalently @xmath74 .",
    "in this section we consider arbitrary graphs as input graphs for the maximum clique problem .",

    "` output ` @xmath87 $ ] ;     +    an example of how the graph @xmath84 is constructed ( in step 6 ) for a specific graph @xmath3 is shown in figure [ gintersectionmaxclique ] .",
    "notice that @xmath3 has five closed neighborhoods ( whereas its intersection number is 3 ) , which are shown in dashed squares , so the graph @xmath84 has 5 vertices .",
    "the corresponding clique of @xmath84 that maximizes @xmath88 is @xmath89 .     and corresponding @xmath84 . ]",
    "we first present the following lemma that concerns basic properties of the relation @xmath90 .",
    "[ relationproperties ] the closed neighborhood relation @xmath90 is an equivalence relation with the following properties :    1 .   it is an equivalence relation which partitions the vertex set @xmath36 in equivalence classes called closed neighborhoods .",
    "a closed neighborhood is a clique .",
    "two closed neighborhoods either form a clique , or no edge between their vertices exists .    _ proof . _",
    "( 1 ) the fact that @xmath90 is an equivalence relation follows directly by its definition .",
    "therefore , every vertex belongs to exactly one equivalence class ( i.e. exactly one closed neighborhood ) .",

    "suppose that there is an edge @xmath93 between @xmath94 and @xmath62 in @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath95 .",
    "consider now _ any _ two vertices @xmath96 ( including @xmath97 ) . by definition of the closed neighborhood relation",
    ", we must have that @xmath98 .",
    "since the close neighborhoods are disjoint , this means that @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , either every edge between @xmath100 and @xmath101 appears in @xmath3 , and @xmath102 forms a clique , or no edge between them exists .",
