    "we explore the possibility of a not necessarily new representation but certainly of rare use in literature : the graphic representation of states , in opposition to the analytical representation and to feynman s diagrams , considered still standard today .",
    "the graphic representation of states is exponentially more complex in respect to the standard representation , but this characteristic is considered a merit rather than a flaw , since it makes it possible to obtain a clear visualization of the most minute details that do not appear so evident in too concise representations and thus are not always easily comprehensible .",
    "the exponential increase of dimension of the diagram of states in respect to the number of qubits that constitute the system clearly illustrates the discrepancy of computational power between quantum and classical systems . at the same time , the use of such graphic representation offers a clear visualization of quantum information s flow and of the key - steps of computation during the evolution of the system .    after a brief introductive exposure of the general theory",
    ", we present a constructive procedure to illustrate the new representation by means of concrete examples .",
    "our choice is to explore two models of quantum copying machines by means of analytical representation , standard quantum circuits and diagrams of state , to detect the indicative details of systems and processes considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec::elemdiag ] the new graphical method to analyze quantum information s flow , the diagrams of states , is introduced : elementary diagrams of states for single - qubit and two - qubit systems and a simple scheme to represent entangled states are illustrated .",
    "section [ sec::quantcop ] intruduces quantum copying machines as imperfect cloners of quantum states .",
    "the quantum copying machine of griffiths and niu and the quantum copying machine of buek and hillery are analyzed respectively in sections [ sec::gnqc ] and [ sec::b - hsimm ] : they allow to present a first example of graphic representation by diagrams of states , very useful in determining quantum circuits of easier interpretation .",
    "the analysis of the quantum copying machine of buek and hillery is discussed for both symmetrical and asymmetrical behaviors , each case related to the cryptographic protocol used by the two communicating parties : in the symmetrical case a _ six - state _ protocol requires isotropic cloning of the information transmitted , while in the asymmetrical case the isotropy conditions may be relaxed when a _ four - state _ protocol is used .",
    "finally , in section [ sec::conclus ] our conclusions and some possible directions for future research from the present work are presented , while further details are left in appendixes .    in all the following quantum circuits and diagrams of states , any sequence of logic gates must be read from the left ( input ) to the right ( output ) ; from top to bottom , qubits run from the least significant ( lsb ) to the most significant ( msb ) .",
    "in many situations it can be useful to perform different representations of the issue aimed to study , in order to compare the different typologies of analysis .    to this purpose",
    "we introduce a new graphic method , the diagrams of states , directly derived from the standard feynman representation of quantum circuit . in our opinion , this new graphic representation of states is potentially useful for a clear and intuitive visualization of quantum information s flow during the unitary evolution of not too complex systems .",
    "first , elementary diagrams of states for a system constituted by a single qubit ( correspondingly , by two states ) , are shown in figure [ qcapp - diast1q ] .",

    "_ not _ gate ; 2 .   unitary matrix .",
    "the diagram of states of the _ not _ gate clearly illustrates that the two states are switched .",
    "the unitary matrix is represented by four intersecting lines , each one labeled with the corresponding entry of the matrix .    then , elementary diagrams of states for a system constituted by two qubit ( whose corresponding state space is described by four states ) are shown in figures [ qcapp - diast2q00]-[qcapp - diast2q04 ] .",
    "they comprehend both the previously illustrated single - qubit gates , now set into the state space of two qubits , and the two - qubit gates , all of them listed and described below :                 gates.,width=415 ]     and @xmath0 gate.,width=415 ]    1 .   _",

    "the state diagram for a unitary matrix on the least significant bit is obtained by applying the single - qubit scheme for the unitary matrix presented above ( see figure [ qcapp - diast1q ] , diagram 2 ) to the couples of states @xmath12 and @xmath16 .    the _ swap _ gate switches the states @xmath17 and @xmath18 , leaving the states @xmath19 and @xmath20 unchanged .",
    "the diagram of states for a unitary matrix on the most significant bit is obtained by applying twice the single - qubit scheme for the unitary matrix to the couples of states @xmath14 and @xmath21 .",
    "as before , notice that the lines of the states to which the unitary matrix is applied do intersect while the other lines are overlapping and not intersecting .",
    "in addition to this more widely used representation , labeled with ( a ) in figure [ qcapp - diast2q02 ] , an alternative representation , labeled with ( b ) and usually less convenient than the first one , is also offered . in this case , the unitary matrix on the most significant bit can be obtained by applying two _ swap _ gates and the unitary matrix on the least significant bit ( whose scheme is presented in figure [ qcapp - diast2q01 ] , diagram 3 ) .",
    "the @xmath22 gate switches the states that correspond to msb@xmath23 , that is the couple @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath7 gate does the same operation for msb@xmath25 and thus the states @xmath12 are switched .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath0 gates do similar operations with the control now set on the least significant bit ( instead of the most significant bit ) : the first gate switches the couples of states @xmath15 while the second gate switches the couple of states @xmath14 . as before ,",
    "states that do not switch correspond to overlapping ( not intersecting ) lines .    generalization to system of a greater number of qubits can be immediately drawn from the present procedure .",
    "the diagrams of states also allow to represent _ entanglement _ by means of a very useful and simple scheme , as shown in figure [ qcapp - diasten ] .",
    "in this diagram , the couples of lines , labeled with a and b , correspond to the state of the least significant bit respectively associated to the value @xmath26 and to the value @xmath27 of the most significant bit : a labels the couple of states @xmath12 and b labels the couple of states @xmath24 . it can be easily seen that _ entanglement _ takes place if the couples of states a and b differ for more than a simple factor : in this case the overall state can not be factorized in two single - qubit states .",
    "this representation of _ entanglement _ can be immediately generalized to k qubits , in which case the diagram will be composed by ordered sub - diagrams of @xmath28 elements .",
    "a further generalization can be made considering a @xmath29-level system , known as qunit .",
    "so if a system of k qunits is instead considered , its diagram will be composed by ordered sub - diagrams of @xmath30 elements .",
    "the exponential increase of dimension of the diagram of states in respect to the number of qubits ( or qunits ) that constitute the system clearly illustrates the discrepancy of computational power between quantum and classical systems ; at the same time , the use of such graphic representation offers a clear visualization of the information s flow in quantum space and of the key - steps of the whole procedure .",
    "the _ _ no cloning theorem _ _ affirms the impossibility to realize a machine able to clone the state of a generic qubit , that is the impossibility , given in input a qubit in a generic state , to get two or more qubits in an identical state as output ; @xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus the system in figure [ qcii-02-copperf ] , where @xmath31 is an unitary matrix that represents the action performed on the input and the ancillary qubits , in order to get two exact copies of the first one , can not be realized .",
    "this impossibility is precisely what constitutes the basis of all quantum cryptographic systems .",
    "however a generalization of such an operation , that results being of great interest in several fields of quantum computation and information processing , can be considered .",
    "if the request of perfect copies is given up , it is possible to restrict the search to copies as imperfect clones , since such a procedure does not contradict the _ no cloning theorem _ , which sets limitations only on perfect copies .    thus the former scheme is replaced by the one in figure [ qcii-02-copimperf ] , where @xmath31 is still an unitary matrix that represents the action of copying  , but the states @xmath32 , for @xmath33 , are not required anymore to be exactly the state @xmath34 . in such a case it is possible to obtain states @xmath35 not identical to the state to copy , @xmath34 , but resembling it according to different criteria .",
    "the use of one or more ancillary qubits , that will be discarded at the end of the transformation given by the unitary matrix @xmath31 , is a standard procedure in many situations in which more general transformations in respect to simple unitary transformations are desirable , as the one shown in figure [ qcii-02-copimperf ] . for further details",
    "refer to @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .        in quantum cryptography",
    "such a procedure can be applied by an eavesdropper ( traditionally called eve ) who aims to create a copy of the qubit transmitted by the authorized sender to the authorized receiver ( traditionally called alice and bob ) in cryptographic protocols . after having intercepted the transmitted state , @xmath36 , eve sends an imperfect copy , @xmath37 , to bob and she keeps for herself a second imperfect copy , @xmath38 ,",
    "on which subsequently she will perform opportune measurements . in such operation eve",
    "has fundamentally two goals to achieve : on the one hand she wishes to make her intrusion as unknown as possible to the two communicating parties , and on the other hand she wishes to find out as much information as possible on the state originally transmitted by alice , @xmath39 , by measuring her imperfect copy @xmath38 .",
    "so the analysis of the overall system mainly consists in determining the unitary matrix @xmath31 that optimizes the system in respect to the security of communication ( bob ) or to the best possible intrusion ( eve ) .",
    "the original version of the griffiths - niu copying machine , @xcite,@xcite , in figure [ qcii-02-copgno ] , shows the drawback not to possess the identity : if the perturbation gates ( the control-@xmath40 and control-@xmath41 gates ) are absent , the outcomes of bob and eve are exchanged by the circuit .",
    "this situation in which , with no perturbation , bob s and eve s outcomes are switched is somehow counterintuitive but this drawback can be easily solved by adding at the end of the circuit a _ swap _ gate .    the _ swap _ gate can be synthetized by three _ c - not _ gates as shown in figure [ qcii-02-swap ] .",
    "since _ _ c - not__@xmath42 , the two identical adjacent _ c - not _ gates can be simplified , thus obtaining a modified quantum copying machine , whose quantum circuit is presented in figure [ qcii-02-copgnm ] .        defining :    @xmath43",

    "the bloch sphere can be embedded in a three - dimensional space of cartesian coordinates : here and in the following sections , we call @xmath57 the bloch sphere coordinates of the qubit sent from alice to bob before eavesdropping and @xmath58 , for @xmath59 , the bloch sphere coordinates associated to bob and eve s density matrices @xmath60 after eavesdropping .    bob and eve s density matrices",
    "are then represented in bloch sphere coordinates , expressed as a function of the coordinates @xmath61 of the initial density matrix of alice s pure state :    @xmath62 \\ , x \\\\",

    "observe that in both cases there is a displacement of the bloch sphere and this constitutes a strong limitation to the effective utility of such quantum copying machine .",
    "however , the simplicity of the griffiths - niu copying machine , given by the possibility to describe the system by means of only two qubits ( and correspondingly by means of only four states ) , allows us to introduce in the simplest possible way the diagrams of states , shown in figure [ qcgn - diast ] .    from the quantum circuit in figure [ qcii-02-copgnm ] , by means of the representations illustrated in section [ sec::elemdiag ]",
    ", the upper diagram of states in figure [ qcgn - diast ] can be immediately drawn . from left to right , the diagram starts with the initial state : information flows on the marked lines labeled with @xmath64 , while thinner lines correspond to absence of information , since the initial state of the most significant bit is set to the value @xmath65 .",
    "then operators from @xmath66 to @xmath67 are applied in sequence , represented by the corresponding schemes for two - qubit gates . at the right end of the diagram , the final states can be observed .",
    "this diagram can be simplified in an equivalent one , illustrated in figure [ qcgn - diast ] ( bottom ) , where information s flow can be easily followed .",
    "thus the diagrams of states are very useful in determining a quantum circuit of easier interpretation implementing the modified griffiths - niu copying machine , shown in figure [ qcgn - copgneq ] .     implementing the modified griffith - niu copying machine.,width=438 ]    to examine in more details the action of the griffiths - niu copying machine , it s worthwhile to observe what happens to the flow of information throughout the original circuit and to explicit the reduced density matrices of each intermediate state , according to the scheme in figure [ qcgn - gnmint ] .",
    "remembering the expressions for @xmath68 operators given by equations [ cgn - operab ] and [ cgn - opercd ] , the intermediate states can be expressed by the following equations :    @xmath69\\ ] ]    @xmath70\\ ] ] @xmath71\\ ] ] @xmath72\\ ] ] @xmath73\\ ] ] @xmath74 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } c_{\\alpha } \\,a\\\\ c_{\\beta } \\,b\\\\ - s_{\\beta } \\,b\\\\ - s_{\\alpha } \\,a \\end{array}\\right ] = { |   \\psi_{out } \\rangle}\\ ] ]    in the following we will refer to least and most significant bits respectively with @xmath75 .",
    "the reduced density matrices of the intermediate states are examined .",
    "matrix @xmath76    the state @xmath77 is not _ entangled _ , because the control-@xmath78 acts only on the most significant bit .",

    "if @xmath86 , eve can obtain part of the information on the amplitudes ( the information is transferred on the most significant bit ) , but she does not possess any information on the coherences ( the _ c - not _ gate can not transmit them across the control qubit ) .",

    "they can not be drawn in any way from the previous matrices , @xmath102 and @xmath103 : the necessary information is then contained in the _ entanglement _ among the two qubits , especially for what concerning the coherences .",
    "finally , from the previous expressions it can be noticed that , although having the merit of great simplicity , this quantum copying machine presents the serious flaw of asymmetry and , above all , there is a displacement of the center of the bloch sphere .",
    "these drawbacks are solved in the buek - hillery quantum copying machine , to the price of a greater complexity .      the buek - hillery quantum copying machine , @xcite,@xcite , is implemented by the quantum circuit shown in figure [ qcii-02-copbh ]",
    ".        the initial state of the ancillary qubits can be opportunely selected , according to the goal to ensue .",
    "parameters can be considered assuming real values , with the condition of normalization holding :    @xmath104    this quantum copying machine produces two distinct copies of an initial state .",
    "thus it finds useful applications in quantum cryptography , in the situation when the state to copy is the one alice is willing to send to bob and eve is instead intercepting : one copy will be used by eve and the other one will be sent again to bob , replacing the original state intercepted .",
    "we suppose that the quantum copying machine is totally controlled by eve , so that she can opportunely vary the noise produced on the signal sent to bob .",
    "the great merit of this quantum copying machine consists in the fact that the matrix * u * produces only an exchange of states , while the control is entrusted entirely to the initial state of the ancillae .",
    "the mixing among the initial state , which the eavesdropper aims to copy , and the control state , in which the ancillary qubits are initialized , are very surprisingly given by simple tensor product of the corresponding states . thus the action of the quantum copying machine consists in exchanging the states , as illustrated in the diagrams of states subsequently shown in figures [ qcbh - diast1 ] and [ qcbh - diast2 ] .    in the analysis of the action of this quantum copying machine ,",
    "the interesting point is the evaluation of the quality of the copy that remains to eve , in comparison with the noise produced in the copy sent again to bob ; precisely , the relation occurring among these two factors will be examined for different assumptions on parameters of the state of the ancillary qubits introduced by eve .",

    "the isotropy conditions may be relaxed for a _ four - state _",
    "protocol , which allows alice and bob to use two different bases of measurement , equivalently to measure along two of the three axes of the bloch sphere .",
    "let us consider the case when eve knows that alice and bob use a four - state protocol and that she also knows the choice of the two possible bases of measurement ; therefore it is not necessary for eve to reproduce as correctly as possible the coordinates @xmath136 , but she needs only to faithfully reproduce the two coordinates involved in the protocol .",
    "thus it is not necessary to impose the condition of symmetry for all the three coordinates , but such condition has to be applied only at the two coordinates considered in the protocol .",
    "so it s worthwhile to verify if the choice of an asymmetrical protocol may offer advantageous conditions to eve , now that a faithful reproduction of states on each coordinate is no longer needed . the choice of the coordinate not to be considered for imposition of symmetry influences significantly the difficulty of the analysis of the asymmetrical case . in accordance with literature , the maximal simplicity of analysis results for a symmetrical cloning in the coordinates @xmath137 and neglecting the coordinate @xmath138 , that means considering equatorial states",

    "quantum algorithms can currently be listed under a few main classes and this suggest that the state of the art in quantum information theory is still far from a complete understanding and full exploitation of the potentialities offered by quantum mechanics for computation and information processing . in our opinion , this might be due both to the fact that quantum computation is a rather new discipline in respect to conventional computation and to the necessity , for a quantum algorithm whose importance may be significant , to overcome in performances the classical counterparts .",
