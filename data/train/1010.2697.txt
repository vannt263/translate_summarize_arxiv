    "the galactic center region is known to have a high concentration of massive , warm , dense and turbulent molecular clouds . due to strong tidal forces exerted by the gravitational potential of the nuclear cluster and the massive black hole , sgr  a * ,",
    "only dense molecular gas is expected to survive in this region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this has the ramification that the formation of massive stellar clusters must be pervasive in this region as evidenced by the arches and quintuple clusters as well as the nuclear massive cluster centered on sgr  a * ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ) which is possibly the best example of mini - starburst activity in the galaxy .",
    "although our present understanding of star formation is primarily limited to observations of low - mass stars @xcite , probing star forming sites in the galactic center region can be useful in addressing the key mechanism by which massive stars are formed ( m @xmath8 10 ) ( see * ? ? ? * and references cited therein ) .    here",
    ", we examine the nature of a group of massive young stars lying within 2.5@xmath9 of the dynamical center of the galaxy @xcite . at a projected distance of 6 pc from sgr  a * ,",
    "there is a cluster of compact hii regions on the edge of the 50  molecular cloud m-0.02 - 0.07 .",
    "this cluster consists of brightest hii regions in the galactic center with the exception of the cluster of hii regions in sgr b2 .",

    "* and references cited therein ) which is known to be a supernova remnant ( snr g0.0 + 0.0 ) . since sgr  a east appears to be interacting with the galactic center circumnuclear molecular ring , which itself orbits sgr  a * , it is probable that sgr  a east , m-0.02 - 0.07 , and the cluster of hii regions all lie near the galactic center , not far from their projected distances .",
    "the compact hii regions , known as the sgr  a east hii a to d ( sgr a a - d ) , trace the site of recent massive star formation nearest to the dynamical center of the galaxy .",
    "the four hii regions have radial velocities ranging between 43 and 49 , thus appear dynamically coupled to the 50  molecular cloud @xcite . with the exception of [ ariii ] emission from sgr  a - d hii source , ir spectroscopic measurements detected [ neii ] and [ ariii ] line emission from all four components ( a - d ) indicating that the exciting stars have spectral types of o8-b0 @xcite , consistent with h76@xmath2 measurements @xcite .",
    "the measured extinction toward sgr  a east a - c is less than that of source d @xcite .",
    "additional extinction for source d is likely due to the 50  molecular clouds or due to material associated with the ionizing stellar source @xcite .",
    "these authors estimate the extinction values at 12.8@xmath1 m are @xmath10mag for a - c and @xmath03.3 toward the sgr a d source .",
    "these extinction measurements imply that the sgr  a east a - c hii regions , which are resolved spatially , are located on the front side of the molecular cloud , whereas the compact sgr  a d source or g359.96 - 0.08 ( hereafter this source is called d ) , may be embedded within the 50 km s@xmath7 molecular cloud .",

    "is detected at the position of the most compact hii source d. the low fractional abundance of ar@xmath12 led to the suggestion that stellar temperatures of the sgr  a east hii regions range between 34,500 and 36,500k @xcite which are consistent with spectra types o8-o9 stars @xcite .",
    "the spectral identification of the sgr  a d source has not been clear but @xcite suggest that its spectrum could be consistent with a combination of an ultracompact ( uc ) hii region and b[e ] stars . here",
    ", we investigate radio and infrared properties of the most compact ( d source ) and extended ( a source ) of the sgr  a east hii regions .",
    "radio continuum observations were made with the d configuration of the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) , at 43 ghz ( 7 mm ) .",
    "the source was observed as part of a survey of uc hii regions in the galactic center , which took place may 29 , 2009 .",
    "the source was observed in the fast switching mode of the vla ( each cycle had 150 seconds on the source and 15 seconds on the complex gain calibrator - nrao530 ) for a total of 20 minutes .",

    "standard data editing and calibration of the gains was done in aips . using standard calibration",
    ", we also reduced multi - configuration radio continuum data at 8.3 ghz ( ay43 ) .",
    "the 4.8ghz data were taken from @xcite .      the sgr  a east hii region cluster was observed in the [ ne ii ] ( 12.8 @xmath1 m ) line with the high - resolution mid - infrared spectrograph texes on the nasa irtf on 2009 june 3 and 2010 may 30 ( ut ) .",

    "hii source d was reobserved in 2010 to obtain better spatial sampling and higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "these measurements also allowed us to detect 12.8@xmath1 m emission from the d source using our low spectral resolution data and medium resolution data taken in 2009 .",
    "the spectral coverage of the data was 2270 , which in the cross - dispersed observations was broken into 8 spectral orders of the high - resolution grating . [ ne ii ] line emission was detected in a 60  interval centered at v@xmath15  @xmath16 46 .",
    "dust continuum emission was only marginally detected outside of this spectral interval ( also see figure 3 showing source d before and after deconvolution . )    the data were first processed with the standard texes pipeline reduction program @xcite , which removes spikes , corrects for optical distortions , and produces wavelength and intensity calibrated maps .",
    "it was then processed with a maximum - entropy - method deconvolution routine , which improved the spatial resolution to about 0.7 , slightly better than the infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) diffraction limit . because a part of the point - spread function is caused by seeing , which can not be exactly the same for the observations of the psf calibrator ( vx sgr ) and the hii region , the results of the deconvolution should be viewed with some caution , but the close similarity between the deconvolved [ ne ii ] data and the higher resolution radio continuum data indicates that the results should be reliable .",
    "in addition , all of the features that we discuss in the [ ne ii ] data can be seen before deconvolution , although some sources , notably the two peaks in hii source d , blend together .",
    "the absolute astrometry of the 12.8@xmath1 m data is about few arcseconds .",

    "a pattern of dithered observations was obtained at each pointing in the survey with each exposure having a duration of 48 seconds .    for this study we used a total of 8 exposures in each of the two filters that covered the region near source d. calibrated images",
    "were retrieved from the hubble data archive , which had been processed using the latest nicmos instrumental calibrations and data reduction software .",
    "the eight calibrated images in each filter were combined using the `` multidrizzle '' task in the stsdas package of pyraf .",
    "the final drizzle - combined images at pa@xmath2 and 1.90@xmath1 m were subsequently rescaled using the latest nicmos photometric zeropoint information to produce images in calibrated units of jy .    to determine the position uncertainty of the stars ,",
    "a gaussian was fitted to two different f190n images with different exposures .",
    "both images were used in making the drizzled mosaic .",
    "this allows us to to measure random pointing errors from exposure to exposure , as well as the uncertainties in our measurements of the centroid in the images .",
    "the random errors in pointing and measurements are on the order of @xmath17 .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the random relative errors associated with hst reacquiring guide stars in between exposures .",
    "in addition to this random error of @xmath18 , there is also an absolute rms uncertainty of @xmath19 in how well the coordinates of the hst guide stars are known .",

    "we made several cuts across the region where there is a depression of submm emission and determined a constant 450@xmath1 m to 850@xmath1 m flux ratio .",
    "since the emission is optically thin , this ratio corresponds to a constant temperature . we note that dust temperature can not be constrained because it is entangled with the uncertainty in the ratio of optical depths . since there is no evidence for a temperature gradient in the dust distribution , it is possibile that the gas in the cavity is converted into formation of stars within the cloud .",
    "source a is the most extended hii feature and lies to the north , whereas source d , the most compact hii source , lies to the south .",

    "this situation could occur if each star has a disk collimating its jet , and the two disks are coplanar , perhaps as a result of forming from the same cloud .",

    "this seems highly unlikely ( see additional arguments against two stars , as described below ) . a model with one exciting source for the entire ionized gas distribution would seem more plausible if it could explain the spatial distribution of radio emission .",

    "the 1.90@xmath1 m emission appears to coincide close to the compact component of source d2 , suggesting that a single source in the vicinity of or coincident with d2 may be responsible for the ionization producing the extended radio continuum and pa@xmath2 nebular emission .",

    "if a point source is present at d1 , then its brightness must be at least 40 times lower than the source at d2 .",
    "otherwise , we would detected the irac source looking slightly extended , and the position would be closer to the midpoint between d1 and d2 .",
    "that means that a source at d1 must be at least 1.5 - 2.5 mag fainter than the source at d2 .    in order to characterize the properties and the evolutionary phase of the stellar source responsible for the excitation of ionized material in source d",

    "the characteristic position - velocity diagrams of several types of compact hii regions shown in figs .",
    "45 - 48 of @xcite , show that the kinematics of source a is clearly cometary .",
    "position - velocity diagrams of all three sources , with 3  wide cuts , are shown in figure 9 .",
    "the position velocity ( pv ) diagram for source b is similar to that for a , but shows a smaller extent in both position and velocity , so is not so well resolved .",
    "source c may be similar , but is even less well resolved .",
    "the pv diagrams of figure 8 match bow shocks in which the stellar wind of an o star sweeps the ionized gas into a thin , paraboloidal shell .",
    "the position - velocity diagrams of sources b and c are very similar to that of source a. most compact hii regions with recognizable kinematics observed in [ ne ii ] fall into the latter category , with the hii regions lying on the near sides of their molecular clouds , presumably because extinction through molecular clouds prevents observation of [ ne ii ] emission from those lying on the far sides .",
    "hii source a ( as well as b and probably c ) is unusual in that the orientation of its position - velocity diagram indicates that its head is tipped toward us .",
    "if it lies on the surface of a molecular cloud with its tail pointing out of the cloud , it must lie on the back side .",
    "this is somewhat surprising given the small extinction to the source .",
    "in addition , its velocity indicates that the star is moving relative to the 50   molecular cloud .",
    "in fact , its kinematics matches very well that expected for ionized gas in a bow shock around an o star moving through molecular gas ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the star is moving to the east an toward us at an angle of roughly 30 .",
    "perhaps this should nt be surprising , given that this is the most commonly cited model for a cometary hii region , but it is not what was observed by zhu et al . , who found that most cometary hii regions are actually pressure - driven flows around stationary stars near the surfaces of molecular clouds .",
    "it seems likely that the turbulent environment near the galactic center with high density gradient in molecular gas resulted in stars which rather quickly moved out of their natal clouds and are now drifting through lower density ( and so lower extinction ) molecular gas .",
    "the ionizing stars for a , b , and c are not evident in irac data ( see fig .",
    "if present , they are not noticeably brighter than typical fore / background stars , nor are they located symmetrically at the centers of a - c . in stark contrast , d has an extremely bright point source .",
    "this difference alone indicates a significant difference between sources d and a - c .",
    "additional difference between d and a - c hii regions comes from msx observations .",
    "source d has the extremely bright point source that is increasingly more prominent with increasing wavelength .",
    "however , the relative brightness of d drops noticeably compared to a - c when msx data at 8 and 24@xmath1 m are used .",
    "this suggests a lower dust mass for d , or that the bulk of the dust is warmer .",
    "the radio measurements indicate that d1 is optically thin at 5 - 44 ghz , although the slight increase in flux from d2 at higher frequencies suggests that it may be partially optically thick at the very core .",
    "the 1.9@xmath1 m  measurements also indicate clearly a bright stellar source near the peak of the radio emission of d2 . as the emission is predominantly optically thin in radio wavelengths , so adopting a distance 8kpc and an ionized gas temperature of 8000k , the total flux of 81mjy at 43.3ghz yields an estimate of the volume emission measure @xmath76@xmath77 .",
    "the associated hydrogen recombination rate requires an ionization rate @xmath78s@xmath7 , where @xmath79 is the hydrogen recombination coefficient into all levels but the ground state . as some ionizing photons might escape the immediate surroundings ,",
    "be absorbed by dust or be absorbed very close to the exciting star , where free - free optical depth may be large , this estimate is a lower limit on the ionizing photon production rate by the central source .",
    "the parameters of the sed of this source suggest that the stellar source g359.23 - 0.063 is associated with a 25  star ( see table 3 ) and 8@xmath5 .",
    "these parameters compare well with the @xmath80s@xmath7 emitted by a o9/b0.5 star @xcite .",
    "the full extent of the source in the ns direction is about 18@xmath45 .",
    "assuming a source size of 9and an expansion velocity of @xmath81  give an age of @xmath82 years ( this age estimate could be a lower limit if the motion is due to flows along the surfaces of the cloud . ) this presents the earliest phase of massive star formation in the 50 cloud .",
    "the estimate for the mass of stars exciting sources a - c can not be made as the stellar source is not identified in these hii regions . however ,",
    "if we assume that the a - c sources have similar masses to that of d , we can make an estimate of the total mass of stars in this regions . to compute the total cluster mass of sgr a east ,",
    "we adopt a standard broken power - law form of the imf @xcite and assume 100   in stars above 20 .",
    "this corresponds to a total stellar mass above 0.5  of 940  associated with a group of young stars in sgr a east .",
    "assuming that the typical age of the cluster is @xmath83 years , we estimate star formation rate of 0.01 to 0.001 yr@xmath7 .",
    "we can also make an estimate of the total mass of molecular gas that went into forming stars .",
    "we used 850 @xmath1 m images of figure 1 to estimate the depleted gas mass by converting submillimeter flux to the mass of molecular gas .",
    "we estimate a subtracted flux of 15 jy at 850@xmath1 m depleted from the region where the group of hii regions is distributed .",
    "we assumed that dust emission from the 50  cloud was uniformly distributed inside and outside the hii regions prior the formation of stars . for a dust temperature of 20 k and a conversion factor from 850@xmath1 m to gas mass @xcite",
    ", we find a rough total gas mass of 7.7@xmath84  that dissipated and converted into 940  of stars .",
    "the near - infrared observations show that despite the ionized gas morphology suggesting a pair of compact hii region , it is probably a single source that is exciting both d1 and d2 .",
    "presumably d1 is produced by irradiation of a dense clump of gas distributed within a cavity that has been partly evacuated of lower density gas by the stellar radiation field . in this scenario ,",
    "the clump has an angular diameter of @xmath85au and lies at a projected distance of @xmath86au from d2 , and so intercepts approximately 10% of the ionizing photons escaping the d1 region .",
    "the observed 30mjy flux at 43ghz requires a total ionization rate at the clump surface of @xmath87s@xmath7 , implying that the exciting source is emitting ionizing photons at a rate @xmath88s@xmath7 .",
    "we now attempt to construct a model to explain the observations of source d. in particular , we need to explain the spatial distribution of the ionized gas and infrared continuum emission , as well as the motions of the ionized gas .",
    "the ionized gas is distributed between two sources , d1 and d2 , each of which is elongated in the ns direction .",
    "it is nearly symmetric about a ns line passing between d1 and d2 , but with the eastern peak , d1 , lying somewhat north of the western peak , d2 , with a p.a .",
    "the infrared continuum , at both 1.9@xmath1 m  and 12.8@xmath1 m shows a single peak that lies between the ionized gas peaks , but probably closer to d2 .",
    "the kinematics of the ionized gas can be described by two probably related structures .",
    "a pair of spectrally broad features extend to the north from the d1 and d2 peaks .",
    "the eastern feature extends in velocity from near the molecular cloud velocity redward by about 30 .",
    "the western feature extends about 30  blueward of the molecular cloud .",
    "lower velocity emission is seen both north and south of the peaks , broadening both spectrally and spatially going to the north .",
    "the two broad - lined emission features seem most naturally explained by a bipolar jet pair , probably interacting with the wall of a cavity",
    ". the jet could originate from a young star surrounded by a disk , lying between d1 and d2 .",
    "the disk axis is tipped at a p.a .",
    "@xmath16 70 , with the west side tipped toward us , so that the western jet is blueshifted .",
    "the fact that the jets are not seen extending to the east and west of d1 and d2 indicates that the observed [ ne ii ] emission is not from the jets themselves , but from the region of interaction between the jets and a surrounding wall .",
    "in fact , the bright emission peaks could be simply regions of a wall which are illuminated by ionizing radiation , but the width of the emission lines indicates that jets are needed .",
    "the offset between the position of the 1.9 @xmath1 m  continuum and the position of the axis of the symmetry of d1/d2 can also be explained by inhomogeneity of gaseous material in the vicinity of the star and/or the motion of the star .",
    "figure 9 shows a schematic diagram of the relative location of d1 , d2 and the central massive star with a flaring disk .",
    "the fact that d1 is redshifted and d2 is blueshifted could be explained if the disk is seen at an angle between edge - on and face - on , with the west side of the disk tipped toward us .",
    "the lack of symmetry in this diagram is likely the result of density gradient surrounding the star .",
    "the 50 molecular cloud lies mainly to the west of the central star .",
    "high mass stars efficiently photoevaporate their circumstellar disks on timescales of 10@xmath89  10@xmath90 years .",
    "the piling up of the resulting disk wind as it expands against the surrounding medium could be responsible for the @xmath91 of ionized material we identify as sources d1 and d2 .",
    "the semianalytic photoevaporated disk - wind model of @xcite applied to a 28 m star yields a mass flux @xmath92myr@xmath7 , indicating an age of @xmath93 years .",
    "the momentum of the material would be maintained by contributions from the momentum fluxes @xmath94mkms@xmath7 from each of the disk wind ( @xmath95,kms@xmath7 ) @xcite and stellar wind ( @xmath96myr@xmath7 and v @xmath0 1000 ) .",
    "another potential contribution could arise from a fraction of the total momentum flux @xmath97l@xmath98myr@xmath7kms@xmath7 in the photons emitted by the central star .",
    "the extensions to the north could trace the regions of interaction of the jets with the cavity wall if the star is moving to the south , although it is not apparent why broad - lined emission would persist after the jets pass by .",
    "an explanation is also needed for the probable offset of the infrared continuum emission toward d2 .",
    "one possibility is that the disk that collimates the jets is close enough to edge - on that it prevents a direct view of the central star even in the infrared .",
    "the near infrared continuum radiation could be scattered into our line of sight by the material that forms the ionized gas peak d2 . since d1 lies on the far side of the disk , backscattering ( which would be less efficient )",
    "would be required for it d1 to be seen in scattered light .",
    "it may also be obscured by the disk if the disk extends out far enough to cover it .",
    "the 12.8@xmath1 m  continuum is unlikely to be scattered , but it could also be affected by extinction , and it is not so convincingly offset from the center of d as is the 1.9@xmath1 m  emission .",
    "the spectrally narrow emission extending both north and south of the d peaks is even more difficult to explain than the broad - lined emission .",
    "the ring - like pattern seen in the position - velocity diagrams in figure 7 could be due to gas in each cut lying on an expanding ring .",
    "the fact that the pv rings increase in spatial and velocity extent going to the north would indicate that the three - dimensional ionized gas distribution is on the surface of an expanding cone , with the expansion speed increasing to the north .",
    "alternatively , the gas could be flowing along the surface of a cone if it is accelerating so as to make its speed increase linearly with declination .",
    "however , we can not propose a physical model that would cause either of these flow patterns .",
    "we know of no other case of an expanding cone like what we suggest or any reason a conical wall would expand in this way .",
    "a flow along the surface of a cone seems more natural , but all cometary hii regions we have observed , with sources a - c being representative , are paraboloidal rather than conical , with much larger opening angles that in d. they also have most of their acceleration in a small distance from their vertexes .",
    "( a constant @xmath99 would result in @xmath100 , or @xmath101 , rather than the observed constant @xmath102 . )",
    "it is especially puzzling that the ionized cone has its vertex 3  south of d , so presumably leading the ionizing star , which we think is moving in that direction .",
    "we have to conclude that we are unable to propose a consistent model for the north - south velocity of ionized gas associated with source d. the narrow - lined gas appears to be distributed on the surface of a wedge or cone with an opening angle @xmath020 , with its vertex @xmath03south of the star",
    ".      why are cometary hii sources a - c oriented head - on , with velocity offsets indicating that their ionizing stars are moving through the 50  molecular cloud , whereas most cometary hii regions seen in [ ne ii ] are seen tail - on with little stellar motion ?",
    "the answer may lie in the circumstances of their formation .",
    "the location of the sgr  a east hii regions near the edge of the sgr  a east supernova remnant suggests that the ionizing stars may have formed as a result of compression of molecular gas by the snr .",
    "if the stars formed in swept - up gas , they would have formed with the velocity of the gas .",
    "after their formation , the compressed shell would have slowed as more gas was swept up , and the stars could have drifted out of the compressed gas .",
    "the stars may now be moving through gas of low enough density that extinction does not affect the [ ne ii ] emission , as it would if they were still inside of a dense molecular cloud .",
    "from the orientation of its broken shell , it appears that the ionizing star of hii source a is moving to the east , as well as toward us . from the offset of its position - velocity diagram ,",
    "its motion relative to the 50  molecular cloud is @xmath030 .",
    "the ionizing stars of sources b and c have similar motions . in particular , the position - velocity diagrams indicate that all three sources are moving toward us , while source b is moving to the east and source c is moving to the northeast .",
    "the @xmath103kms@xmath7 velocity width of the [ neii ] line is consistent with other ultra - compact hii regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the characterization of a cluster of hii regions sgr  a a - d may not be correct , as these hii regions appear to be unbound due to their large physical separation , signifying isolated star formation near the galactic center . again",
    ", the site of on - going star formation is consistent with sites of massive star formation elsewhere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have presented multi - wavelength observations of a chain of hii regions located at the eastern edge of the sgr a east supernova remnant and the 50   molecular cloud .",
    "these hii regions show the youngest star formation activity closest to the galactic center .",
    "the youngest member of sgr a east hii regions g359.956 - 0.08 or the sgr a d source is estimated to have an age of roughly 1.5@xmath5 years and consists of two elongated ionized features .",
    "we identified the central star responsible for ionizing both components of the d source .",
    "the sed fit of the central star indicates a mass of 25   and a luminosity of 8@xmath5  .",
    "the kinematics of ionized gas show a an e - w red and blue shifted flow with respect to the central star and a complex asymmetric velocity structure in the n - s direction .",
    "we presented a simple model in which the central star is surrounded by a disk constraining the flow of ionized wind . in this picture",
    ", the uv radiation from the central hot star may generate an outflow from the disk , sweeping up the ism gas and forming the two components of ionized gas d1 and d2 .",
    "given that high density molecular material is distributed to the west , the ionized feature d2 is expected to lie closer to the central star .",
    "future high spectral resolution observations of ionized gas and detailed modeling of the complex n - s velocity structure should explain better the kinematics of ionized gas presented here .",
