    "modern dynamical system theory can help us in understanding the evolution of cosmological models .",
    "this remark in the introduction of the classical wainwright and ellis textbook @xcite , is both true and full of sense : it is often confronting approaches that one can really understand problems . in the context of spatially homogeneous and anisotropic universes it was fully investigated since the pioneering famous works of the 70 s ( e.g. @xcite for the bkl conjecture , @xcite for mixmaster universes or @xcite for the triangle map ) up to mathematical proofs and deep understanding of this dynamics by @xcite or extension to space - time dimensions @xmath0",
    "e.g. @xcite .    the situation is a little bit less rich in the context of spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes . concerning the classical friedmann - lematre ( fl ) universes containing non - interacting barotropic fluids , various scenari for the fate of the universe",
    "have been popularized . among these",
    "are the big chill - when cosmic expansion is endless or the big crunch - a final singularity of same nature than the big bang for spatially closed cosmologies with vanishing or small cosmological constant , or more recently big rip @xcite , when universe s scale factor become infinite at a finite time in the future .",
    "dynamical systems tools have allowed some important results in the question of future asymptotic behavior of cosmic expansion , for instance by demonstrating the existence of attracting regimes and scaling solutions in quintessence models @xcite , @xcite .",
    "solutions to cosmological dynamics consists of time evolution of density parameters associated to the barotropic fluids usually invoked to model matter contents of the universe .",
    "the fate of the universe is completely related to its matter content .",
    "for example , big rip singularity occurs when universe contains the so - called phantom dark energy  associated to a barotropic fluid with equation of state @xmath1 where the barotropic index @xmath2 .",
    "recently , it appears that cosmological fl models with _ interacting _ components have gained interest because it might be expected that the most abundant components in the present universe , dark energy ( de ) and dark matter ( dm ) , probably interact with each other .",
    "such interactions are considered by some authors to be promising mechanisms to solve some of the @xmath3cdm problems like coincidence ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . in the literature",
    "the coupling between interacting fluids is generally time - independant and quadratic in energy density @xmath4(see @xcite and reference therein ) where @xmath5 is a dimensioned constant or time - dependant and polynomial in energy density @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hubble parameter and @xmath8 and @xmath9 relevant integers ( see @xcite and references therein ) .  in these two categories of papers , new behaviors",
    "are speculated for cosmological dynamics with non - linear interactions .",
    "in particular the existence of cycles have been postulated if one of the species is barotropic with an index @xmath2 .     in this paper",
    ", we present for the first time fl universe containing fluids in interaction as a particular case of the well known lotka - volterra system .",
    "this formulation is possible when one consider the system in term of density contrasts @xmath10 @xmath11 evolving through the variable @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the scale factor of the fl universe .  on the one hand",
    "this make us able to use a lot of standard techniques of dynamical systems analysis in the context of cosmology ; and , on the other hand , this allows ( as billiards do for anisotropic models ) a global comprehension of this important cosmological problem .",
    "when there are no interactions between constitutive fluids , this formulation allows to interpret those dynamics in a pedagogical way through an intuitive and simple formulation .",
    "the fl cosmological dynamics can then be seen as a competition between several species , each associated to one of the fluids filling the universe .",
    "those species all compete for feeding upon the same resource which is spatial curvature .",
    "the usual asymptotic states of fl dynamics , de sitter , einstein - de sitter and milne universes , can all be seen as a particular equilibrium between cosmic species .",
    "this is the simplest picture of the jungle universe .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new kind of coupling between fluids of the form @xmath14 .",
    "this is not an ad hoc approach since this the only way to preserve the natural lotka - volterra form of the fl dynamics .",
    "moreover this time - dependent coupling , once analyzed following the scaling cosmology method presented by @xcite , shows that it grows with the cosmic time .",
    "this last property makes this ansatz relevant both with observational constraints and to avoid the coincidence problem .",
    "the paper is structured as follow : in section [ section1 ] we show that fl cosmological dynamics is actually a generalized lotka - volterra system ; in section [ section2 ] we interpret the fl cosmological dynamics in terms of the generalized lotka - volterra system : the jungle universe ; in section [ section3 ] , we show how a general and physical interaction between two fluids can preserve the structure of this dynamical system and we obtain the general lyapunov function for this kind of dynamics ; in section [ section4 ] , we generalize the formulation to @xmath15 directly coupled species and focus in particular to triads ( @xmath16 ) and quartets ( @xmath17 ) ; finally , we draw some conclusions in section [ section5 ] .      in",
    "what follows , vectors are written bold faced ( e.g. @xmath18 ) and the associated coordinates in the canonical basis are denoted by the italic corresponding letters with an index ( e.g. @xmath19 ) .",

    "both parameters @xmath28 and @xmath3 might be seen as fixing the spatial and intrinsic curvature of the geometry . among the three above equations , only two are independent since",
    "all are related through the second bianchi identities .",
    "the remaining two equations still include three unknown functions : @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath27 .",
    "this under - determination can be raised by introducing an equation of state for the matter fluids .",
    "for example , barotropic fluids are such that @xmath39 where the constant @xmath40  is called the barotropic index .  in a general physical way",
    ", this index ranges from @xmath41 for scalar field frozen in unstable vacuum to @xmath42 for stiff matter ( e.g. free scalar field ) where sound velocity equals to speed of light . in this paper",
    "we restrict our analysis to such barotropic physical fluids . following standard procedure ,",

    "this point of view is not anecdotal and will reveal a lot of benefit : such equations are very well known to the dynamical system specialist , it allows a lot of intuitive non trivial results , establish an analogy that will help us deriving new cosmological behavior for coupled models besides of providing a pedagogic and interesting insight on cosmic expansion .",
    "first of all , it is easy to see that orbits can not cross the @xmath64 or @xmath65axes which are orbits themselves .",
    "as the matrix @xmath58 fully degenerates ( rank equal to 1)it is clearly not invertible , equilibrium points must lie on axis .",

    "this is obvious since , in the absence of a cosmological constant ( @xmath82 ) , the competition is left between matter and curvature energy densities , the latter decreasing as @xmath83 . therefore , asymptotic dominance of matter is only possible when @xmath84 , so that the related density can eventually dominate ( since it scales as @xmath85 ) .",
    "* if the initial condition lies on the @xmath86 axis the attractor is the de sitter universe for any values of @xmath87 once again , this is obvious since asymptotically the constant energy density of the cosmological term will dominate the decreasing energy density related to the curvature .",

    "the new point here is the dynamical population formulation of the problem and interesting results will be derived through usual techniques in dynamical system theory .",
    "we will also present new cosmological consequences on coupled models which are directly inspired by the analogy with evolution of populations in competition .",
    "one possibility consists of investigating how far the natural cyclic orbits appearing usually in population dynamics could appear in standard cosmology .",

    "on the other hand , this kind of interactions is broadly used in cosmology , with the coupling between inflaton and radiation during reheating ( e.g. , @xcite ) or the one between dark matter and dark energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or even the decay of heavy matter particles like wimps into light relativistic particles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "this constitutes a coupled quintessence scenario @xcite . on one hand",
    ", it is necessary to preserve the global energy conservation as imposed by noether theorem and poincare invariance , energy transfer must compensate in the global energy balance .",
    "hence , at each time , the part of the energy taken by the first component must be given to the other to which it couples .",
    "to achieve this , conservation equations for two coupled dark fluids must be of the following form : @xmath47{l}% \\dot{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{d}}=-3h\\rho_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left (   1+\\omega_{\\mathrm{d}% } \\right )   + \\mathcal{q}\\ \\\\ \\dot{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{e}}=-3h\\rho_{\\mathrm{e}}\\left (   1+\\omega_{\\mathrm{e}% } \\right )   -\\mathcal{q}% \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath111 represents the energy transfer .",
