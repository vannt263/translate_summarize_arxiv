    ", such a map sends the cone of positive operators acting on a given hilbert space into itself .",
    "a map @xmath2 is called _ completely positive _ ( cp ) , if the tensor product @xmath3 is positive for any dimension @xmath0 of an auxiliary hilbert space .    on the one hand ,",
    "the structure of the set of completely positive maps , which forms a proper subset of the set of positive maps , is already well understood .",
    "completely positive maps find direct application in quantum theory as they correspond to _ quantum operations _ , which can be realized in a physical experiment . on the other hand , in spite of a considerable effort several years ago",
    "@xcite and more recently @xcite the structure of the set of positive maps acting on operators defined on a @xmath4 dimensional hilbert space @xmath5 is well understood only for @xmath6 . in this case",
    "every positive map is decomposable , as it can be represented as a sum of a completely positive map and a completely co - positive map .",
    "this mathematical fact , following from the results of strmer @xcite and woronowicz @xcite , has profound consequences for the entire theory of quantum entanglement .",
    "it implies that the commonly used ppt criterion for quantum separability @xcite works in both directions only for @xmath7 quantum systems @xcite . in other words ,",
    "any state of a two qubit system is separable if and only if it has the property of positive partial transpose ( ppt ) .",
    "hence in this simplest case the sets of separable states and ppt states coincide , and any state characterized by a negative partial transpose is entangled .",
    "this is not the case for higher dimensions .",
    "for instance , the existence of non - decomposable positive maps shown for @xmath8 by choi @xcite , implies that for a @xmath9 quantum system there exist ppt entangled states .",
    "such quantum states are called _ bound entangled _",
    "@xcite , as they can not be distilled into maximally entangled states , and their subtle properties became recently a subject of a vivid scientific interest @xcite .",
    "in general , the question of characterizing the set of entangled states for an arbitrary quantum system composed of two subsystems of size @xmath4 , remains as one of the key unsolved problems in the theory of quantum information .",
    "however , from a mathematical perspective this problem is related to characterization of the set of all positive maps in @xmath4 dimensions , which is known to be difficult .",
    "it is convenient to define a subclass of positive maps , called _",
    "@xmath0-positive _ , such that @xmath10 is positive .- positive maps defined for an integer @xmath0 and @xmath11-positive maps @xcite , in which @xmath11 denotes a certain cone of operators . ]",
    "it is well known that @xmath4-positive maps are completely positive @xcite . due to the theorem of stinespring @xcite any cp map",
    "can be represented as a sum of _ similarity maps _ : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the hermitian conjugation , and the operators @xmath14 are arbitrary . in physics literature the operators @xmath14",
    "are called _ kraus operators _ , @xcite and it is possible to find such representation for which the number of them does not exceed @xmath15 .",
    "in general the operators @xmath14 are of rank @xmath4 , but it is useful to distinguish the class of linear maps for which there exists a representation into kraus operators of rank not greater than @xmath0 , where @xmath16",
    ". these maps will be called _",
    "@xmath0-superpositive _ , since in the case @xmath17 , the set of maps ( denoted by @xmath18 in @xcite ) for which all kraus operators can be chosen to be of rank @xmath19 , coincides with the set of _ superpositive maps _ , introduced by ando @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "any linear map acting on a set of positive operators on @xmath5 represents an operator acting on the composed hilbert space @xmath20 .",
    "this fact , known as _ jamiokowski _",
    "isomorphism due to his early contribution @xcite , implies an intrinsic relation between the sets of quantum maps and quantum states @xcite . in particular ,",
    "positive maps correspond to _ block positive _",
    "operators @xcite , while completely positive maps are represented by positive operators @xcite .",
    "thus a positive matrix representing a completely positive map in this isomorphism is called a _ choi matrix _ or _ dynamical matrix _ @xcite .",
    "making use of the standard hilbert - schmidt scalar product of two operators one can introduce a duality relation between sets of operators .",
    "the set of positive operators @xmath21 is selfdual .",
    "the sets of block positive operators is known to be dual to the set of separable operators .",
    "therefore we can not resists a temptation to call elements of the set dual to the set of _",
    "@xmath0-block positive _ operators as _",
    "@xmath0-separable _ , although the same set appears in the literature @xcite and is characterized by the maximal schmidt number of its element .",
    "note that the sets of operators which are a ) block positive , b ) @xmath22-block positive , c ) positive , d ) @xmath22-separable and e ) separable , form a nested chain of proper subsets , see fig .",
    "[ figuredualities0 ] and table [ table1cones ] the same inclusion relations holds for the corresponding sets of maps . as the elements of the cone dual to the cone of positive maps are called superpositive maps @xcite ( or _ entanglement breaking channels _",
    "@xcite ) , the dual to the set of @xmath0-positive maps consists of @xmath0-superpositive maps .    since the set of block positive operators and separable operators are dual ,",
    "any positive map ( which is not completely positive ) can be used to detect quantum entanglement . in particular , the choi matrix representing such a map is given by a block positive operator and it may play the role of an _ entanglement witness _ @xcite .

    "the key advantage of this notion is due to the fact that the hermitian operator @xmath27 can be considered as an observable , and the expectation value tr@xmath30 can be decomposed into a sum of quantities , which may be directly _ measured _ in a laboratory .",
    "in such a way one may experimentally confirm that an analyzed quantum state @xmath31 is indeed entangled @xcite .",
    "the set of entanglement witnesses corresponds thus to the set of block positive operators , the structure of which for @xmath32 is still being investigated @xcite .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that there is no universal witness , which could detect entanglement of any state , but for any entangled state a suitable witness can be found .",
    "the most valuable are extreme entanglement witnesses , which form extreme points of the set of block positive operators , since they can also detect entanglement of some weakly entangled states . in this way",
    "the theory of quantum information provides a direct motivation to study the structure of the set of block positive operators ( i.e. the set of entanglement witnesses ) and its various subsets .",
    "the aim of this work is to contribute to understanding of the non trivial structure of the set of positive maps and the corresponding set of block positive operators .",
    "we provide a constructive characterization of various subsets of the set of positive maps . in particular we study relations based on duality between convex cones .",
    "another class of results concerns composition of quantum maps .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review necessary definitions of @xmath0-positive and @xmath0-superpositive maps and formulate a kind of generalized jamiokowski - choi theorem , which relates them to @xmath0-block positive and @xmath0-separable operators .",
    "several other characterizations of these sets are proved . in section 3",
    "we discuss the duality between the cones of @xmath0 positive and @xmath0-superpositive maps and analyze its consequences .",
    "in section [ secmappingcones ] we study the relations of the results obtained in the previous sections to @xmath11-positive maps , where @xmath11 is a so - called _ mapping cone _ , introduced in @xcite .",
    "in this section we give the definitions to which we refer in later parts of the paper and provide some concrete examples of objects that match these definitions .",
    "we review certain results already known in the literature and for convenience of the reader we prove some of them .    in the entire paper , we shall consider only finite dimensional linear spaces .",

    "<S> the structure of cones of positive and @xmath0-positive maps acting on a finite - dimensional hilbert space is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> special emphasis is given to their duality relations to the sets of superpositive and @xmath0-superpositive maps . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize @xmath0-positive and @xmath0-superpositive maps with regard to their properties under taking compositions . a number of results obtained for maps are also rephrased for the corresponding cones of block positive , @xmath0-block positive , separable and @xmath0-separable operators , due to the jamiokowski - choi isomorphism . </S>",
    "<S> generalizations to a situation where no such simple isomorphism is available are also made , employing the idea of mapping cones . as a side result to our discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we show that extreme entanglement witnesses , which are optimal , should be of special interest in entanglement studies . </S>"
