    "images from the sxi on goes-12 revealed a soft - x ray flaring size of approximately 1.5 arc min . with these values ,",
    "the maximum expected free - free emission ( e.g. ) of a homogeneous source is @xmath24 100 s.f.u . with a turnover frequency around 10 ghz .",
    "it is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the observed radio fluxes .",
    "nonetheless , we can investigate the necessary conditions that a thermal source should fulfill to account for the increase in flux above 200 ghz .",

    "we may try to reconcile this brightness to the observed antenna temperatures from the well known approximation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the source solid angle size and @xmath35 the antenna beam solid angle , can be approximately written as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the projected size on the sun of the antenna beam . equating ( 4 ) with ( 2 )",
    "we obtain @xmath38 + the interpretations of the 212 and 405 ghz emission in terms of optically thick free - free radiation ( @xmath39 ) implies @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the temperature of an isothermal radio source . for @xmath42 arc - seconds , from equation ( 4 ) we get @xmath43 k that is temperatures to which the goes instrument is sensitive . however , em is more than three orders of magnitude larger than that obtained from goes .",
    "thus , like for other events exhibiting the thz component , the thermal interpretation is not consistent with a compact source @xcite . +      if the 212 and 405 ghz sources are small , non - thermal mechanisms by high energy particles ( electrons and ions ) have to be considered to produce the emissions observed during the 6 december 2006 .",
    "the optically thick gyrosynchrotron emission and the free - free absorption might be taken in consideration to account for the observed flux increase with frequency .",
    "assuming , for example , a burst cylindrical volume with @xmath44 arc - second diameter and @xmath44 arc - second height , on a plasma medium with ambient density of @xmath45 @xmath22 and a temperature of a few @xmath46 k , implies in a moderate @xmath47 .",
    "if the sub - millimeter flaring area has a magnetic field @xmath48 g , and the non - thermal electrons a mean density @xmath49 @xmath22 for energies @xmath50 kev the self - absorption will also contribute with the attenuation of the microwaves while still producing enough emission at the sub - thz domain . on the other hand , it can be shown that the effectiveness of the razin supression at 200 ghz requires a high medium density where free - free absorption dominates .",
    "of course the two sub - thz frequencies data points for the 6 december 2006 burst are not sufficient to define the complete synchrotron spectrum and the various parameters involved to shape it .",
    "+ a challenging explanation is needed for the `` double spectral '' emission , with one microwave component peaking between 6 and 15 ghz and another spectrally independent component peaking somewhere in the thz range .",
    "one explanation might conceive independent accelerators at the flaring source , producing different energy electrons nearly simultaneously , emitting at two spectral components .",
    "however the observations available are too limited to bring any favorable evidence for this possibility .",
    "another scenario suggested by might be adopted , placing a single accelerator closer to a single polarity foot - point injecting electrons into a magnetic morphology split into two separate loops , one low altitude with stronger field , another weaker field , higher above the solar surface , originating the two synchrotron spectral components .",
    "although this possibility was suggested in the discussion of other bursts of this class @xcite , it requires a number of selective free assumptions for the emissions not sufficiently constrained by the existing observations .",
    "+ synchrotron emission from high energy positrons was first proposed by to account for microwaves .",
    "more recently , suggested that positrons from charged pions would be an attractive possibility to explain the thz component .",
    "indeed , for one event , showed that : ( i ) the 210 ghz impulsive phase emission started simultaneously with the pion production and ; ( ii ) the 210 ghz emitting source coincided with a region of ion interactions , distinct from regions of electron interactions .",
    "such an interpretation can not be quantitatively studied in the case of the 6 december 2006 flare because the @xmath0-ray emission from this flare was only measured below 17 mev by rhessi .",
    "this is a too low energy to estimate the relative contributions of pions and electrons to the @xmath3 10 mev @xmath0-ray continuum ( cf and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that , for similar events , the number of positrons needed to explain the sub - thz emission was found much larger than that derived from @xmath0-ray measurements @xcite .",
    "we should note , however , that there is a theoretical possibility for enhanced positron production by proton - proton interactions by the drell - yan process @xcite .",
    "+ another suggestion was given by simulations of fully relativistic electron beams propagating into high density and high magnetic field medium , generating langmuir waves producing strong backward emissions with intensities larger at higher sub - thz frequencies as observed @xcite .",
    "the same beam , with energies of about 2 mev , might also produce the 10 - 20 ghz microwaves as observed .",
    "this possibility was also simulated using proton beams @xcite .",
    "however , these simulations have not taken into account the importance of absorption by the surrounding dense medium . +",
    "another possibility to explain a double - peak spectrum in the microwave - submillimeter range is to consider particle - wave instabilities in electron beams accelerated to ultra - relativistic energies , known as `` microbunching '' .",
    "the thz spectral component is attributed to incoherent synchrotron radiation ( isr ) emitted by ultra - relativistic beams of electrons .",
    "the beams are bunched when traversing inhomogeneous magnetic field structures , which are known to be common to sunspots @xcite .",
    "the ghz spectral component arises from the broadband coherent synchrotron radiation ( csr ) produced by a wave - particle instability , as a result from the bunching of the high energy accelerated electron beams .",
    "the mechanism that produce intense broadband csr was known for long time @xcite , but only recently recognized in laboratory accelerators @xcite . and discussed the relevance of this process for solar flares .",
    "the mechanism is highly efficient .",
    "the total power emitted by a bunch is proportional to the total number of electrons in the beam emitting the observed isr peaking in the thz range , according to the standard interpretation , while the csr peaking in the ghz range is proportional to the square of the same number times a form factor ( @xmath51 , ) .",
    "this means that only a small fraction of the accelerated electrons satisfying this condition are needed to account for the observed microwaves .",
    "+ the same electron beams producing the isr may eventually collide into denser regions in the solar atmosphere producing x- and @xmath0-rays by bremsstrahlung .",
    "it has been shown that the isr spectral contribution to the observed x- and @xmath0-rays might also become significant , although not a necessary condition @xcite . the number of electrons required to produce the hard x- and @xmath0-rays emissions should be compared to the number of electrons needed to produce the isr spectrum in the thz range ( rather than at microwaves as is usually done ) . this approach may bring a possible explanation to the electron number discrepancy , also known as the `` electron number paradox '' @xcite .",
    "the sub - thz emitting region could not be spatially resolved during the 6 december 2006 event .",
    "therefore , a thermal interpretation of the radio emission above 200 ghz can not be discarded if we assume a single source whose size is larger than 15 arc - seconds . however , the rather good similarity between hard x - ray and sub - thz time profiles and the fact that hard x - rays are emitted in discrete sources with diameters of the order of 10 arc - seconds , suggest that the sub - thz radiation was produced in several non - thermal sources .",
    "if this is the case , the emission , which should peak in the thz region , might be attributed to incoherent synchrotron radiation ( isr ) from ultra relativistic electrons or positrons .",
    "+ a non - thermal interpretation brings questions on the nature of the microwave spectra observed together with the sub - thz emission .",
    "possibilities discussed above suggest that electrons are injected into different magnetic arches of different magnetic field strengths and electron densities . in order to produce the two separate synchrotron spectral components .",
    "the razin effect might play a role to suppress the optically thin synchrotron emission below 400 ghz .",
    "+ the microwave emission might be at least partially produced by another mechanism recently recognized in laboratory accelerators .",
    "indeed , intense broadband coherent synchrotron radiation ( csr ) in the microwave range may be produced as the result of the bunching of high energy electron beams .",
    "these beams also produce the incoherent synchrotron radiation ( isr ) in the thz range",
    ". the electron beams producing the isr may eventually collide into denser regions where they may contribute to the x- and @xmath0-ray bremsstrahlung continuum .",
    "it should also be noted that additional contribution to hard x - rays and @xmath0-rays might come from the high frequency part of the isr spectrum .",
    "+ progresses in this field of research require measurements in the unexplored thz range which are crucial for the understanding of the relative importance of the mechanisms discussed in this study .",
