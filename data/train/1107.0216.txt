    "one of the most striking results in relativistic heavy ion collisions , at rhic and the lhc , is the existence of structures in the two - particle correlations plotted as function of the pseudorapidity difference @xmath1 and the angular spacing @xmath2 .",
    "these structures may have a common hydrodynamic origin : the combined effect of longitudinal high energy density tubes ( leftover from initial particle collisions ) and transverse expansion . in order to compare with the data mentioned above , event - by - event 3 + 1 hydrodynamics must be used . in this type of approach ,",
    "some initial conditions are generated , an hydrodynamics code is run and results are stored ; this is done many times thus mimicking experience .",
    "this method has been developed since 2001 by the brazilian collaboration spherio @xcite ( some typical results can be seen in @xcite ) .",
    "it has been also studied since 2007 by of h.petersen et al .",
    "@xcite . in 2010 , k.werner et al . @xcite and b.schenke et al . @xcite",
    "have also started to use this method .",
    "all groups except the last one assume an ideal fluid .",
    "( recently , various groups have also been working on event - by - event 2 + 1 hydrodynamics , see e.g. @xcite . )      in the nexspherio approach , initial conditions , generated with the nexus code , have tubular structures and two particle correlations exhibit _ near _ and _ away - side _",
    "ridges @xcite as can be seen in figure [ ic2d ] . in the calculation by k.werner et al .",
    ", initial conditions , obtained with the epos code , also have tubular structures and two particle correlations exhibit near - side @xcite and _ small _ away - side ridges @xcite .",
    "( the other two groups mentioned above have no result on two - particle correlations . )",

    "when using nexspherio , it is not clear how the various structures in the two - particle correlations are generated . to investigate this , we study the transverse expansion of a _ realistic _",
    "slice of matter with only one tube ( cf .",
    "figure [ tube ] ) .",
    "longitudinal expansion is assumed to be boost invariant and freeze out to occur at some constant temperature .    as seen in figure [ 1dist ]",
    ", the single particle angular distribution has two peaks located on both sides of the position of the tube , more or less independently of the transverse momentum value .",
    "the peak spacing is @xmath5 ( this is not a parameter . ) the resulting two - particle angular correlation has a large central peak at @xmath6 ( corresponding to the near - side ridge ) and two smaller peaks respectively at @xmath7 ( associated to the double - hump ridge ) .",
    "we have checked that this structure is robust by studying the effect of the height and shape of the background , initial velocity , height , radius and location of the tube @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of the two - peak emission can be understood from figure [ 1dist ] .",
    "as time goes on , as a consequence of the tube expansion , a hole appears at the location of the high - energy tube ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this hole is surrounded by matter that piles up in a roughly semi - circular cliff of high energy density matter .",
    "the two extremities of the cliff emit more fast particles than the background giving rise to the two - peaks in the single - particle angular distribution .     left : choice of a typical nexus tube located near the border .",

    ", one must sum on all tube positions . for a given tube position ,",
    "the single particle angular distribution is more complicated ( the double - peak signature of the tube may be hidden by the elliptic flow ) and the shape of the two - particle angular distribution depends on the trigger angle with respect to the reaction plane . after subtracting the elliptic flow and averaging on the tube angular position ,",
    "the two - particle correlation is found to be single peaked for in plane trigger and double peaked for out - of - plane trigger in agreement with data .      with these information",
    ", we can discuss what happens in a more complex event such as a nexus event .",
    "only the outer tubes need to be considered and will contribute with rather similar two - peak emission pattern at various angles in the single particle angular distribution .",
    "the two - particle correlation has a well - defined main structure similar to that of a single tube surrounded by several other peaks and depressions due to trigger and associated particles coming from different tubes . when averaging over many events they disappear and only the main one - tube like structure is left .",
    "event - by - event 3 + 1 hydrodynamic with tubular initial conditions predicts two - particle correlations as function of @xmath0 in qualitative agreement with data . using a simpler model ,",
    "we have seen that near - side and away - side structures are related to a `` two - horn '' emission from each tube .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that both these near - side and away - side structures are due to the triangular flow ( @xmath8 ) produced by a triangular shape ( or triangularity @xmath9 ) present in the initial conditions .",
    "the one - tube model does have triangularity and triangular flow .",
    "however , one can add three inner tubes to cancel @xmath9 and still have the same @xmath8 because only the outer tube contributes to this quantity . by removing this outer tube , leaving only the three inner tubes",
    ", one can have @xmath10 while @xmath9 decreases a little but is non - zero .",
    "both @xmath9 ( due to @xmath11 ) and @xmath8 are sensitive to external tubes however @xmath8 more so . as a consequence , on an event - by - event basis @xmath12 will not be satisfied .",
    "a more systematic study is in progress ( see also @xcite ) .",
