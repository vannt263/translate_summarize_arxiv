    "the delta  scuti stars are common pulsators on and near the main - sequence situated inside the classical instability strip .",
    "they generally pulsate with nonradial modes and small photometric amplitudes in the millimag range .",
    "these stars also essentially share the high rotational velocity of the average star of spectral type a. however , a number of population i stars shows dominant radial modes , amplitudes in excess of 0.3 mag and rotates with a projected rotational velocity less than 30 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the members of this subgroup are called hads ( high - amplitude delta scuti stars ) .    for the delta scuti stars",
    ", there exists a strong connection between rotation and pulsation properties , such as amplitude .",
    "we are presently engaged in a program to examine the stars between the two extremes of amplitude ( e.g. , for 44  tau , see @xcite ) .",
    "we note that with extensive data and nonradial mode identifications the aspect angle can be determined accurately , so that the true rotational velocity can be obtained from the spectroscopic @xmath3 measurements .",
    "the list of pulsators in the hipparcos catalogue @xcite , as reanalyzed for multiperiodicity by @xcite , contains a number of stars belonging to this intermediate group .",
    "ee  cam ( hip  27199 , hd  37857 ) is a promising target with reported peak - to - peak amplitudes near 80 millimag .",
    "its rotational velocity is presently unknown , but was suspected to be low because of the relatively large pulsational amplitude . in particular , we are interested in detecting another variable such as 44  tau @xcite which has a @xmath1 value of only 2 km s@xmath0 , in order to separate the effects of true low rotational velocity and geometric aspect . @xcite classified ee cam as an f3 giant ( gf3 ) .",
    "the catalog by @xcite gives a temperature of 6530k and a [ fe / h ] abundance of 0.06 relative to the sun .",
    "@xcite analyzed the hipparcos data and suggested two frequencies of 4.93 and 5.21 c / d , respectively .",
    "in 2006 and 2007 , photometric observations were performed using the vienna university automatic photoelectric telescope ( apt ; @xcite ) located at washington camp , arizona , usa . the `` wolfgang '' telecope acquired altogether 304 hours of strmgren @xmath4 data from 2006 february 14 to 2006 april 2 and from 2006 september 19 to 2007 april 5 .",
    "the three - star technique was employed with hd  35606 ( c1 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , f8 ) and hd  32745 ( c2 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , g0 ) as comparison stars . since for c2 ,",
    "long - term variability at time scales of days could not be excluded , the data reduction was applied solely relying on c1 . while the three - star technique was not applied in the final reductions , the importance of the technique in checking for possible small - amplitude variability in the chosen comparison stars was again demonstrated .",
    "a complete list of the measurements used to extract the light curves is provided in table  [ tabjournal ] .",
    "typical examples of light curves of ee  cam are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] together with the multifrequency solution derived in the next section .",
    "the pulsation frequency analyses were performed with a package of computer programs with single - frequency and multiple - frequency techniques ( period04 , @xcite ) , which utilize fourier as well as multiple - least - squares algorithms .",
    "the latter technique fits up to several hundred simultaneous sinusoidal variations in the magnitude domain and does not rely on sequential prewhitening .",
    "the amplitudes and phases of all modes / frequencies are determined by minimizing the residuals between the measurements and the fit .",
    "the frequencies can also be improved at the same time .    to decrease the noise in the power spectra ,",
    "we have combined the measurements obtained in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 passbands .",
    "the dependence of the pulsation amplitude on wavelength was compensated by multiplying the @xmath10 data set by an experimentally determined factor of 0.64 and increasing the weight of these data points correspondingly .",
    "this scaling creates similar amplitudes in both passbands but does not falsify the power spectra . note that different colors and data sets were only combined to detect new frequency peaks in the fourier power spectrum and to determine the significance of the detection .",
    "the effects of imperfect amplitude scaling and small phase shifts between colors can be shown to be negligible for period finding . for prewhitening , separate solutions were obtained for each color by multiple least - square fits . in the analysis of the delta scuti network campaign data , we usually apply a specific statistical criterion for judging the reality of a newly discovered peak in the fourier spectra , viz . , a ratio of amplitude signal / noise = 4.0 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis consists of a number of different steps to be repeated .",
    "each step involves the computation of a fourier analysis ( power spectrum ) from the original data or a previously prewhitened fit .",
    "the dominant peaks in the power spectrum were then examined for statistical significance and possible effects of daily and annual aliasing . for computing new multifrequency solutions , the amplitudes and phases",
    "were computed separately for each color , so that even these small errors associated with combining different colors were avoided .",
    "note that the new multifrequency solutions were always computed from the observed ( not the prewhitened ) data .",
    "because of the day - time and observing - season ( annual ) gaps , different alias possibilities were tried out and the fit with the lowest residuals selected .",
    "the resulting optimum multifrequency solutions were then prewhitened and the analysis repeated while adding more and more frequencies , until the new peaks were no longer statistically significant .",
    "an independently performed sigspec analysis @xcite , which employs a statistical treatment of discrete fourier transform ( dft ) amplitudes that would be produced by white noise , provided exact consistency with the results obtained from the above procedure .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the details of the search for the multiple frequencies , which are listed in table  [ tabfreqs ] .",
    "the average residuals of the 15-frequency fit in the @xmath9 passband were @xmath11 0.005 mag per single measurement , which is higher than the 0.003 mag expected from typical apt campaigns .",
    "this is caused by the large number of presently unresolved additional pulsation frequencies with small amplitudes , as revealed by the power spectrum of the residuals .",
    "we can now compare the new multifrequency results with a previous result based on much fewer data : the two frequencies of 4.93 and 5.21 cd@xmath0 found by @xcite are in exact agreement with our two frequencies showing the highest amplitudes .",
    "it is possible to estimate the nonradial degree , @xmath12 , of the dominant pulsation mode from the available photometry ( for a recent application see @xcite ) . from the @xmath10 and @xmath9 passbands",
    "we derive a value of @xmath13 = + 3.3 @xmath11 0.4@xmath14 . in this temperature domain",
    ", such positive values generally indicate radial pulsation . indeed , preliminary pulsation model calculations for ee cam identify a unique value of @xmath12 = 0 ,",
    "i.e. , radial pulsation .",
    "the frequency ratio @xmath15 = 0.946 .",
    "such a frequency ratio can not be identified with radial modes ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , so that @xmath16 has to be nonradial .",
    "we also note that @xmath17 and @xmath18 form a close frequency pair .",
    "such close frequencies are not unusual in delta scuti stars ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . in the case of ee cam , however , we can not yet exclude the possibility that the close - frequency pair could be an artifact of strong amplitude variability of the dominant mode .",
    "ee  cam certainly deserves a thorough spectroscopic study . here",
    "we present new results which shed light on the subject of the rotation of the star .",
    "two spectra of ee  cam and one spectrum of a standard star , hd  89449 ( 40  leo , f6iv ) , were obtained with the david dunlop observatory 1.88 m telescope on feb .",
    "14 , 2006 . for ee cam ,",
    "the ut start times were 05:15:19 ( 1220 s exposure time ) and 06:14:02 ( 1803 s exposure time ) , while for hd 89449 the values were 06:52:16 and 200s .",
    "the spectra were centred at the mg  i 5184   triplet and covered the range 5070 to 5306   with an effective spectral resolution of about 0.35  .",
    "a full technical description is given in @xcite .",
    "the spectra were rectified and then processed using the broadening function ( bf ) formalism ( as described in the same paper ) and subsequently improved during the ddo binary - star program ( for the last paper of the series , see @xcite ) .",
    "the bf s were determined over the span of 61 points at the 6.7 km  s@xmath0 spacing thus covering @xmath19 km  s@xmath0 . with such processing ,",
    "a bf of a very sharp - line spectrum has a half - width at the base of 19.5 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the broken line in the figure ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) shows the rotational profile calculated for the limb darkening of @xmath20 ( this choice is not critical ) in comparison with the bf for ee  cam .",
    "the bf differs from the simple rotational profile in having a well - defined , but unexplainable structure .",
    "the complex shape of the bf for ee  cam can be interpreted as : ( 1 ) a superposition of two sharp peaks , possibly from two different , unresolved stars with slightly different velocities or ( 2 ) one broad peak with some self - absorption , or ( 3 ) signatures of two shocks propagating through the atmosphere .",
    "the most likely is the last interpretation as the first two have no real support in what we know about the star .",
    "if the broadening of the bf at the base is interpreted by rotation of ee  cam , then the observed half - width at the base ( 45.4 and 44.8 km  s@xmath0 respectively ) can be used to estimate @xmath3 .",
    "the two bf s , when corrected for the intrinsic broadening introduced by the formalism and for @xmath21 of the template itself , give @xmath22 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the real uncertainty is larger than one determined from the difference of the two spectra and is about 3 km  s@xmath0 as based on results for similar stars observed in the ddo programme .",
    "note that the depression of the baseline around the bf peak is of no importance ; it is a characteristic feature for bf s of stars with rotationally broadenened lines as this reflects the uncertainty of the pseudo - continuum placement in the spectrum rectification step . at the time of observations",
    ", the star appeared to have the mean heliocentric velocity of @xmath23 km  s@xmath0 , on the assumption that the radial velocity of the template star hd  89449 is @xmath24 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "this assumed the fit by the rotationally broadened profile , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] ; note that the standard / template star in the bf technique is used to determine the broadening profile for the program star as shown in this figure ( and used for the @xmath1 determination ) as well as the relative radial velocities .",
    "the mean radial velocity of ee  cam was estimated at @xmath25 km  s@xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the bf can be used as an indication of the spectral match of the template ; an integral of unity indicates a perfect match and an identical spectral type ( or more exactly , an identically strong mg  i 5184   triplet ) .",
    "the two spectra gave the bf integrals of 0.91 and 0.90 which means that the lines are weaker than in the f6iv standard hd  89449 indicating a spectral type close to f5 .",
    "this is confirmed by the data in the tycho-2 catalog @xcite ( star number gsc  4098 - 123 ) where the mean magnitudes give a well defined color index @xmath26 which correponds to the spectral type f5 on the main sequence .",
    "extensive photometric measurements at the millimag level covering several months were carried out .",
    "the frequency analysis has revealed 15 significant pulsation frequencies .",
    "the residuals show that many additional modes in the 0 to 15 cd@xmath0 are present with small amplitudes .",
    "the dominant pulsation at 4.934 cd@xmath0 was identified as a radial mode by examining the phase shifts of the light curves at different wavelengths .",
    "the second most dominant mode at 5.214 cd@xmath0 was found to be nonradial .",
    "this star , therefore , is an excellent example of a star showing both the properties of the hads and the common small - amplitude pulsators , in which the radial modes are either absent or very weak .",
    "this picture of a star in the astrophysical transition region is supported by new measurements of the projected rotational velocity : two medium - dispersion spectra yielded a @xmath1 value of @xmath2 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this value is higher than the upper limit of 30 km s@xmath0 for the hads , but lower than the rotational velocity of the typical low - amplitude delta scuti star .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank heide debond and jim thomson for assistance with the spectroscopic observations .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank patrick lenz for computing a preliminary pulsation model .",
    "this investigation has been supported by the austrian fonds zur frderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung and the natural sciences and engineering council ( nserc ) of canada .",
    "alias patterns ( spectral - window insert of the top panel ) .",
    "the lowest panel clearly shows the power spectrum of the residuals from the 15-frequency solution : the excess power in the 5 to 15 cd@xmath0 range shows additional pulsation frequencies and demonstrates the rich pulsation spectrum of ee  cam .",
