    "we consider many sources of uncertainty . below",
    "we explain the origin and derivation of each uncertainty estimate .",
    "numerical : :    first we estimate the numerical accuracy of the calculations . in the    eihh method",
    "@xcite , the calculations are usually repeated with    the model space truncated at increasing values of the maximal    hyperangular momentum @xmath138 , until the differences    between consecutive @xmath138 results become    negligible .",
    "accordingly , the numerical uncertainty can be estimated ,    as in  @xcite , from the difference between two results obtained with    different @xmath138 values . however , unlike    ref .",
    "@xcite , here we encountered very slow convergence nuclei    compared with @xmath139he , and was indeed slightly worse for    @xmath77he than for @xmath77h .",
    "] , especially with the    @xmath78eft potential , and particularly for the    @xmath140 terms , which turned out to be more    sensitive to the parameterization of the hyperradial grid .    consequently , the final values we provide for many    terms , the individual    @xmath140 terms ( including    @xmath53 ) , @xmath46 , and    the sum of all other @xmath141 terms . ]",
    "were obtained    by extrapolating the results of several calculations made with    different @xmath138 values .",
    "therefore , for some of our    results the numerical uncertainty was estimated from these    extrapolations . nuclear model : :    next we note the dependence of the results on the nuclear model , which    is probed as in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the av18/uix and    @xmath78eft potentials .",
    "the final values we present are    obtained by taking the mean value of the two results . as in    refs .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding uncertainty is estimated as    their difference divided by @xmath142 , to account for the    possibility that the `` true '' result lies outside the range bounded by    the two calculated results .",
    "isb : :    the next source of uncertainty stems from the conservation of isospin    symmetry in our calculations , _ i.e. _ , we assume that the total isospin    is a conserved quantity throughout the calculation .",
    "all nucleons are    taken to be of equal mass , which is the average between the proton and    neutron masses .",
    "the difference between the proton and the neutron is    manifested only in their gyromagnetic factors and in the    electromagnetic interaction included in the nn interaction . in the    @xmath143 nuclei , most of the isospin symmetry breaking ( isb )",
    "effect can be accounted for by allowing the nuclear ground - state wave    functions to include also the channel with higher total isospin value    @xmath81 .",
    "this , however , increases the number of basis    states in each calculation and the associated computational cost rises    rapidly with @xmath138 .",
    "it was therefore performed    selectively only to estimate the uncertainty associated with    performing isospin conserving calculations .",
    "nucleon - size corrections : :    comparing the coordinate - space and momentum - space treatments of the ns    corrections we conclude that higher - order corrections to the terms we    obtained are expected only at @xmath61 . for the    zemach moments we were able to undertake a more accurate approach",
    ",    from which we estimate these higher - order corrections to be    @xmath144% ( @xmath145% ) for    @xmath1he@xmath2 ( @xmath1h ) .",
    "however , for consistency we use here only the low-@xmath146    approximation of the nucleon electric form factor , and use the above    corrections to estimate the ns - related uncertainties of the    @xmath147 terms .",
    "relativistic corrections : :    as explained in section  2 , relativistic corrections were included only    for the leading electric dipole contribution    @xmath42 .",
    "their sum turned out to be    @xmath148% ( @xmath149% ) of the non - relativistic value    in @xmath77he ( @xmath77h ) .",
    "we therefore estimated the    uncertainty due to uncalculated relativistic corrections of the other    contributions to be of that relative size .",
    "we would like to point out    two aspects of the elastic ( zemach ) term : ( i ) comparing the    non - relativistic calculation of @xmath31 of    @xmath4d in ref .",
    "@xcite with the relativistic treatment in    ref .",
    "@xcite reveals a discrepancy of the same order as the    uncertainty estimate given above .",
    "( ii ) we calculate    @xmath31 according to the definition that    connects it to the nuclear zemach moments .",
    "therefore , no relativistic    corrections are needed in the comparison we make with similar results    in the literature . however , when our value for    @xmath111 is used to approximate the full elastic part    of @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the missing    relativistic corrections should be accounted for . in this context , the    total relative uncertainty of @xmath111 should be    increased to @xmath150% .",
    "coulomb corrections : :    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate higher - order coulomb corrections    to be @xmath996% of @xmath140 .",
    "multipole expansion : :    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , our multipole expansion is truncated at    @xmath140 .",
    "based on our results we conservatively    estimate 2% uncertainty in @xmath38 due to    this truncation .",
    "@xmath151 expansion : :    except for the logarithmically enhanced coulomb distortion    contribution , we include in our calculation of    @xmath38 all terms of order    @xmath35 .",
    "since @xmath152 is small for    these systems , the missing contribution from all the higher - order    terms can be approximated by the first unaccounted - for term in the    series , @xmath153 , which is naturally estimated to be    @xmath1541.46% ( 0.73% ) of the size of    @xmath38 in @xmath77he    ( @xmath77h ) .",
    "magnetic mec contribution : :    the magnetic dipole term @xmath155 is calculated    using the impulse approximation ( ia ) operator , and is therefore    missing significant corrections , mainly due to meson - exchange currents    ( mecs ) . the same    ia operator was also used to calculate the magnetic moment    @xmath79 in the nuclear ground state .",
    "the results ,    presented in table  i , show a deviation of the ia    @xmath79 calculated with the av18/uix    ( @xmath78eft ) potential from the very precise experimental    values by 23% ( 21% ) for @xmath77he and 15% ( 13% ) for    @xmath77h .",
    "the same relative errors were therefore assumed    also for the small ia value obtained for    @xmath155 .",
    "the total uncertainties were obtained as a quadrature sum of all the above , where the last five sources do not affect the zemach terms .",
    "the values we thus obtained for the individual and total relative uncertainties estimated for @xmath38 , @xmath107 , and @xmath32 in @xmath1he@xmath2 and @xmath1h are given in table  [ table_err_supp ] below .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath156 can be obtained directly from our results , by summing all terms in @xmath38 except for the zemach terms , due to their cancellation .",
