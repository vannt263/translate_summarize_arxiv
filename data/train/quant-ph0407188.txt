    "giant noise - free optical nonlinearities have been extensively studied over the last decade . in particular , atomic coherence effects such as coherent population trapping ( cpt )  @xcite and",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite have been identified as promising mechanisms for the production of large nonlinear susceptibilities , while significantly reducing absorption and spontaneous emission noise  @xcite .",
    "these effects have been observed in a three - level @xmath1 atomic configuration where an incident probe , in the presence of a pump and under a strict two - photon resonance condition , does not essentially interact with the atomic sample .",
    "optical nonlinearities can be produced if this resonance condition is somewhat disturbed , by introducing either an additional energy level(s )  @xcite , or a mismatch between the probe and the pump field frequencies  @xcite .",
    "improvements of many orders of magnitude with respect to conventional nonlinearities have indeed been observed  @xcite , but are limited to the case of classical fields  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine a four - level atomic _ tripod _ configuration .",
    "this has often been used as an extension of a @xmath1 scheme , e.g. , by paspalakis who suggested its potential for nonlinear optical processes  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that while paspalakis considered the case of a single weak probe , we are adopting a setup with two weak fields namely a @xmath2 and and a @xmath3 in the presence of a strong pump .",
    "the pump creates eit , and leads to a large cross phase modulation ( xpm ) between the probe and the trigger  @xcite .",
    "such a modulation can be used to achieve optical phase shifts of the order @xmath0 radians which can be attained through an alternative phase - gate scheme that is here illustrated .",
    "the binary information is encoded in the polarization degree of freedom  @xcite of an incident probe and trigger pulse while the phase - gate mechanism relies on an enhanced cross - phase modulation between the two pulses .",
    "the gating mechanism will be examined for either semiclassical or quantum probe and trigger fields.the four atomic level _ tripod _",
    "configuration is relatively simple yet robust requiring good control over frequencies and intensities of the probe and trigger laser pulses .",
    "we should also recall that when compared with other schemes  @xcite , the present scheme can substantially reduce the experimental effort for its realizability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dress ] , dressed states analysis is performed .",
    "dressed states are then used to present a simple physical picture illustrating the requirements for a strong xpm . in sec .",
    "[ sec : susceptibilities ] , the expressions for linear and nonlinear susceptibilities are derived for a case of classical fields . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantpt ] we analyze essentially the same system , but with quantized probe and trigger fields , and find that in adiabatic limit , a symmetry of results in semiclassical and quantum adiabatic cases exist .",

    "the energy level scheme of a tripod system is given in fig .",

    "@xcite two contain no contribution from the excited state @xmath17 and hence they are _ dark states_. for the special case of atomic detunings @xmath18 , these are    [ eq : darkstates ] @xmath19    the two other states , @xmath20 contain @xmath21 and have energies @xmath22 .",
    "necessary conditions for achieving a large cross - kerr phase shift can be formulated as follows : @xmath23 probe and trigger must be tuned to dark states , @xmath24 the transparency frequency window for each of these dark states has to be narrow and with a steep dispersion to enable significant group velocity reduction , and @xmath25 there must be a degree of symmetry between the two transparency windows so that trigger and probe group velocities can be made to be equal .",
    "@xcite these conditions can be satisfied by taking all three detunings nearly equal . when detunings differ by very small amounts yet falling within the width of the transparency window , then strong cross - kerr modulation with group velocity matching can still be achieved and phase gate operation realized .",
    "the expressions for the probe and trigger susceptibilities are obtained by solving the relevant optical bloch equations  @xcite for the elements of density matrix @xmath26 . when @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the steady - state population distribution will be symmetric , i.e. , @xmath29 , with vanishing population in the other two levels . the resulting general expression for the steady  state ( @xmath30 )",

    "we here assume equal decay and dephasing rates @xmath41 , @xmath42 .    to examine cross - phase modulation between the probe and the trigger fields , it is sufficient to keep only the two lowest order contributions in the fields , so that    @xmath43    the linear susceptibilities    @xmath44    are completely symmetric with respect to exchange @xmath45 and @xmath46 and so are the third - order nonlinearities    [ eq : kerrsusc ] @xmath47    with @xmath48 for approximately equal atomic detunings .",
    "when all detunings @xmath49 acquire the same value , probe and trigger share a strong control field with rabi frequency @xmath8 and exhibit all effects associated with eit including strong group velocity reductions .",
    "it was first pointed out by lukin and imamolu  @xcite appreciable nonlinear interaction can be achieved when the optical pulses interact within the transparent nonlinear medium for a sufficiently long time .",
    "this happens when both pulses group velocities are very small and equal , a requirement which can easily be met in our proposal owing to the natural symmetry of a tripod configuration .",

    "we consider in this section the case in which probe and trigger are quantum fields .",
    "the pump is still considered much stronger than both of them so as to neglect its quantum fluctuations as for a classical field .",
    "we specifically adopt a recently developed formalism  @xcite and apply it to our tripod atomic configuration .",

    "the equations for probe and trigger pulses propagating along @xmath57axis through the tripod - media are given by    @xmath58    while the equations for the atomic transition operators @xmath59    with generalized detunings defined as in eqs .",

    "we now proceed by assuming the low intensity probe and trigger , @xmath60 and strong pump @xmath61 .",
    "the latter condition also implies that the eit resonances for both , probe and trigger fields are strongly saturated .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath62 , for a probe and trigger fields of equal mean amplitudes @xmath63 , we can assume @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as in the semiclassical case illustrated in the previous section . under these conditions",
    "one arrives at the following equations for the pulse propagation    @xmath66    note that these last two equations emphasize the full symmetry between the probe and the trigger dynamics , a symmetry which is intimately linked with the atomic population being equally distributed between levels @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we assume that the derivatives of the atomic operators vary slowly compared with their respective decay rates . furthermore ,",
    "if the rabi frequencies of the probe and trigger quantum fields are much smaller than @xmath8 , we can perform the adiabatic elimination of the atomic variables , to obtain    [ eq : propeqs ] @xmath69    where group velocities of probe and trigger pulses are given in terms of the respective refraction indices @xmath70  @xcite    @xmath71    expressions for group velocities above are consistent with the semiclassical case  @xcite for the case of equal couplings @xmath72 , equal detunings and weak probe and trigger . the low intensity condition @xmath60 has its semiclassical counterpart in @xmath73 .",

    "intensity fluctuations of 1% yield an error probability of about 4% in the gate fidelity .",
    "this error enters through the fluctuations of the phase shifts @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we also assume that all lasers are tightly phase locked to each other in order to minimize the effects of relative detuning fluctuations .",

    "the dephasing must also be lower .",
    "we have studied the nonlinear cross - kerr response between a probe and trigger field in a four - level atomic sample driven in a tripod configuration . in particular , this has been studied for the case in which both probe and trigger are quantum fields evaluating their relevant phase sifts @xmath91 when both probe and trigger are prepared in a multimode _ coherent _ state .",
    "the theory can further be extended to evaluate the shift acquired by a pair of probe and trigger _ single - photon _ wave packets .",
    "the large cross - kerr modulation between probe and trigger that can be obtained in the tripod configuration enables one to implement a phase gate with a conditional phase shift of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "these large nonlinear phase shifts can also be used to create quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
