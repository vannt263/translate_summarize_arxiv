    "very accurate knowledge of the hadronic cross section is essential for predictions of the hadronic contributions to @xmath6 , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , and to the running of the electromagnetic coupling from its value at low energy up to @xmath7 ( for recent reviews look @xcite ) . due to a complicated experimental setup , the use of monte carlo ( mc ) event generators @xcite , which include various radiative corrections",
    "@xcite is indispensable .",
    "some more extensive analysis of that subject can be found also in @xcite .",
    "the most important hadronic mode , i.e. @xmath3 , was recently measured by kloe @xcite by means of radiative return method . in this measurement only pions ( + missing momenta ) in the final state were observed .",
    "for that particular measurement there is no difference between photon(s ) and the pair production and one should estimate the contribution of the process @xmath8 to the measured cross section . as suggested in @xcite",
    "the contribution from the @xmath1 production to the @xmath9 is sizable and comes mostly from the t - channel bhabha  like diagrams . in this paper",
    "a monte carlo study is performed to test if this claim remains true for a realistic ( kloe ) experimental setup .",

    "we use scalar qed to model the fsr @xmath12 pair emission and the @xmath13 dominance model for the @xmath14 coupling ( see @xcite and @xcite ( from where the model of the pion form factor was implemented ) for details ) . the contribution from initial state radiation ( isr )",

    "we use multi  channel variance reduction method to improve efficiency of the generator and the generation is split into four channels , where two of them absorb peaks present in t  channel diagrams and other two take care of the s  channel peaks .",

    "the matrix element was chosen in a way that only a four dimensional numerical integration was necessary .",
    "the matrix element was integrated by the monte carlo program with full phase space generation and compared with the results obtained with 4-dimensional gauss integration , where the integration region was divided into ( @xmath17 ) rectangular solids ( or more complicated shapes at the border of integration region ) . in each rectangular solid",
    "the 8-point gauss procedure was used recursively .",
    "the error of the gauss method was estimated as the maximal difference of the results with different subdivisions and the central value was taken as a mean of the smallest and the biggest obtained values . the relative difference between mc result and the gauss method",

    "no cuts are imposed as the analytic formulae exist only for that case .",
    "a discrepancy at the level of about 10 % between the monte carlo and the analytic results can be observed in the region were the pair contribution is sizable and it is much larger in the region were the pair contribution is at the level of 1 per mil or lower . for s - channel diagrams",
    "we have found previously @xcite an agreement with analytic results of @xcite at the level of 1 per mil .",
    "we shall observe , that even if we take the relative difference as the error of the mc code , the accuracy of the code is good enough for an estimation of the contribution of the pair production to the process with the photon(s ) radiation . to estimate the complete contribution for the ( unrealistic ) situation with no cuts imposed , the ratio ( denoted by r ) of the t- and the s - channel pair production to the differential cross section of @xmath20 ( born : isr+fsr ) is also presented in table [ tab : table1 ] both for the mc based and the analytic results @xcite .",

    "-0.2 cm -0.2 cm",
    "-0.2 cm -0.2 cm    the contribution from the pair emission to the photon emission depends however a lot on the event selection , even if the t  channel contribution still dominates at low q@xmath21 . it is seen from fig .",
    "[ przekroj_ck ] , where for kloe event selection ( fig .",
    "[ przekroj_ck]a ) one gets only up to 1.2% contribution from the pair emission and up to 2.5% if one uses only the angular cuts on pions polar angles ( fig .",
    "[ przekroj_ck]b ) .",
    "the pair contribution at the @xmath13 peak is about 0.3% for kloe cuts and",
    "0.5% when only the angular cuts are imposed .",
    "even if the pair contribution remains small it has to be taken into account if the aimed experimental precision is of the order of 1% or better .",
    "another important observable used to control the fsr contribution to the cross section of the reaction @xmath23 is the charge asymmetry . again",
    "the measured value contains the pair contributions if only pions are observed .",

    "that conclusion holds despite the fact that the asymmetry for pair production itself is sizable in both cases ( figs .",
    "[ asymet]b and [ asymet_ck]b ) .    as stated already in @xcite , isr and t - channel of electron pairs can be treated likewise isr of photons , what results in the change of the radiator function in the radiative return method .",
    "another possibility is to treat the pair production as a background to the process @xmath24 . in that case",
    "one would like to reduce that background . the way to do that is to veto the outgoing electrons and/or positrons .",
