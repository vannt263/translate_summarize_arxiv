    "<S> we show how a quantum walk can be used to find a marked edge or a marked complete subgraph of a complete graph . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a version of a quantum walk , the scattering walk , which lends itself to experimental implementation . </S>",
    "<S> the edges are marked by adding elements to them that impart a specific phase shift to the particle as it enters or leaves the edge . if the complete graph has @xmath0 vertices and the subgraph has @xmath1 vertices , the particle becomes localized on the subgraph in @xmath2 steps . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a quantum search that is quadratically faster than a corresponding classical search . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to implement the quantum walk using a quantum circuit and a quantum oracle , which allows us to specify the resource needed for a quantitative comparison of the efficiency of classical and quantum searches  the number of oracle calls .    </S>",
    "<S> a quantum walk is a quantum version of a classical random walk . </S>",
    "<S> a classical random walk is described in terms of probabilities ; a particle `` sitting '' ( localized ) on a vertex of a graph has certain probabilities to leave that vertex along different edges . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum walk is described in terms of probability amplitudes , and that means that there are interference effects in quantum walks , which are completely absent in classical random walks . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution in these walks can either be in discrete steps @xcite or continuous @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both types of quantum walks have proven to be fruitful sources of quantum algorithms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a summary of both the properties of quantum walks and their algorithmic applications can be found in a review @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , quantum walks have entered the realm of experiment . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical predictions for the quantum walk on a line have been confirmed in various physical systems  with an ion in a linear trap performing three `` quantum '' steps in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with neutral atoms in an optical lattice in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite or with photons in waveguide lattices with negligible decoherence in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interesting realizations are also those exploiting the fact , that the most important ingredient in quantum walks is the interference . to this </S>",
    "<S> end the wave nature of classical light was exploited in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to propose an analog of a quantum walk , and this analog had been experimentally realized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite though for other purposes . </S>",
    "<S> the use of interferometers to realize quantum walks has also been proposed @xcite and also recently accomplished @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum walks on a line have abundance of interesting properties ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but quantum walks , when considered on more complex graphs provide us with deeper understanding of quantum dynamics and provide us with new insights and hints how to construct new quantum algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , quantum walks have been used to investigate searches on a number of different graphs . in these searches , </S>",
    "<S> one of the vertices is distinguished , and the objective is to find that specific ( marked ) vertex . </S>",
    "<S> the graphs considered so far have been grids and hypercubes of different dimensions and the complete graph @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , up to now , there has been no experimental realization of a search by means of a quantum walk . </S>",
    "<S> one way to achieve this goal may be the adoption of the scattering quantum walk formalism introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which is based on an interferometric analogy of a scattering process . for this type of a walk , </S>",
    "<S> multiport devices are needed . </S>",
    "<S> optically these can be constructed from simpler devices , such as beam splitters , and there is work ongoing to construct multiports for atoms @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose , that instead of finding a distinguished ( marked ) vertex , one is interested in finding a distinguished edge or even a distinguished subgraph . </S>",
    "<S> the case of an edge can be viewed as finding two elements in a list that have a particular relation . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , let us suppose that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are elements of a set , @xmath5 , and that @xmath6 is a classical boolean oracle function on @xmath7 , such that @xmath8 where @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this function then gives us the answer to the question of whether the two elements , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , satisfy the relation . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we are interested in finding pairs @xmath12 such that @xmath13 . there might be a single such pair , which would correspond to finding a single edge , or there might be several .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall pursue this study by using the formalism of scattering quantum walks ( @xcite ) in which the particle resides on the edges of a graph rather than on its vertices . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we used this formalism to study searches on graphs with high symmetry , including complete graphs and various versions of multipartite graphs .    having a graph @xmath14 on which the walk is defined , with @xmath15 being the set of vertices and @xmath16 the set of edges , the hilbert space is defined as @xmath17 this definition implies , that the hilbert space is given by the span of all _ edge states _ </S>",
    "<S> , i.e.  position states @xmath18 interpreted as a particle going from vertex @xmath19 to vertex @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being an edge of the graph @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> these edge states form an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space , which we shall call _ the canonical basis . </S>",
    "<S> _    in this hilbert space the unitary evolution is given by a set of _ local unitary evolutions _ defined for each vertex . if we specify ( for every @xmath19 ) @xmath23 , the set of all edge states originating on vertex @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , the set of all edge states ending on vertex @xmath24 , then local unitary evolutions act as @xmath26 . the overall unitary step operator , @xmath27 , acting on the system is represented by the combined action of the local unitary evolutions , that is </S>",
    "<S> , the restriction of @xmath27 to @xmath28 is just @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> given the initial state of the system is @xmath30 , the state after @xmath31 steps is @xmath32 and the probability of finding the particle ( walker ) in state @xmath33 is then @xmath34 .    let us consider a walk on a complete graph with vertices given by the set @xmath35 containing @xmath0 elements . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state is taken to be the equal superposition of all the edge states @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are reflection and transmission coefficients whose values are @xmath39 this choice of local unitary operators for the scattering walk is analogous to the choice of the _ grover coin , _ see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in a coined quantum walk .    </S>",
    "<S> the target edges are marked by placing `` phase shifters '' on both ends . </S>",
    "<S> these have the effect of modifying the local unitary operations associated with the vertices to which the edge is attached . a particle entering or leaving the edge picks up a phase factor of @xmath40 , and one that is reflected back into the edge picks up a factor of @xmath41 . in more detail , if the edge between vertices @xmath42 and @xmath10 is the only marked edge in the graph , we will have @xmath43    an example of a complete graph with @xmath44 vertices out of which @xmath45 are special ( white ones ) . </S>",
    "<S> the edge between two such vertices is considered to be special and it performs a phase shift for particle either entering or leaving it ( grey bars ) . </S>",
    "<S> ]    let us now consider a specific type of relation,@xmath46 , between vertices ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ [ eq : classical_oracle ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> we specify a subset of vertices , and two vertices satisfy @xmath46 if they are both in the specified subset . </S>",
    "<S> these vertices , and the edges connecting them , will form a complete subgraph . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we consider the problem of a scattering quantum walk on a complete graph with a marked complete subgraph ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cg ] ) . in particular , let the set of @xmath0 vertices of the complete graph be @xmath5 , and the set of @xmath1 vertices connected by marked edges and forming a complete subgraph be @xmath47 . a quantum walk on this graph starting from the initial state given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ initstate ] ) will take place in a small subspace of the overall hilbert space of the walk . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon , the reduction of the effective dimension due to the symmetry of the graph , has been analyzed in detail for coined walks by krovi and brun @xcite and for the scattering walk in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by defining four vectors : @xmath48 these vectors form a basis of a subspace of the hilbert space @xmath49 , which we shall denote by @xmath50 , which is invariant under the action of the unitary operator @xmath27 that advances the walk one step . </S>",
    "<S> the action of @xmath27 on the basis vectors of @xmath50 is given by @xmath51{\\left|{w_2}\\right>}+t{\\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathrm{i}}\\phi}\\sqrt{(k-1)(n - k)}{\\left|{w_4}\\right>},\\\\ { \\hat{u}}{\\left|{w_2}\\right > } & = & [ ( k-1)t - r]{\\left|{w_1}\\right>}+t\\sqrt{k(n - k-1)}{\\left|{w_3}\\right>},\\\\ { \\hat{u}}{\\left|{w_3}\\right > } & = & t\\sqrt{k(n - k-1)}{\\left|{w_1}\\right>}+[r - t(k-1)]{\\left|{w_3}\\right>},\\\\ { \\hat{u}}{\\left|{w_4}\\right > } & = & t{\\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathrm{i}}\\phi}\\sqrt{(k-1)(n - k)}{\\left|{w_2}\\right>}\\\\ & & + [ t(k-2)-r]{\\mathrm{e}}^{2{\\mathrm{i}}\\phi}{\\left|{w_4}\\right>}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the evolution to remain entirely within @xmath50 the initial state must be in this subspace as well . </S>",
    "<S> our initial state [ see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ initstate ] ) ] can be expressed as @xmath52 and is , therefore in @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in order to determine how this particular walk evolves , we need to only consider a four - dimenional problem . </S>",
    "<S> one simply finds the eigenvalues , @xmath53 and eigenstates @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , of @xmath27 restricted to @xmath50 , and finds the state after @xmath31 steps by exploiting expansion @xmath56    we now need to specify the value of @xmath57 . for localizing the particle on the marked edges , we employ phase - shift @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> in the case @xmath59 the expression for the vector after @xmath31 steps reads @xmath60 where the first entry is the @xmath61 component , the second is the @xmath62 component , and so on . in this expression , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63 and the terms that have been neglected are @xmath64 or smaller . </S>",
    "<S> we see that after @xmath65 steps , the particle is in the state @xmath66 , which means it is localized on the marked edges . after running the walk the proper number of steps to localize the particle on the marked edges , we complete the search by measuring the position of the walker to see on which edge it is located .    </S>",
    "<S> if we are searching for a single edge , i.e.  @xmath67 , then the quantum search represents a quadratic speedup over what is possible classically . </S>",
    "<S> classically we would just check each edge to see whether it is marked or not , and we would have to check @xmath68 edges in order to find the marked one ( this will be made more precise shortly ) . </S>",
    "<S> this quantum advantage remains for small subgraphs . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the subgraph is a triangle , our probability of finding all three vertices after running the quantum search twice is @xmath69 and the probability of finding all three vertices after no more than three runs of the search is @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation value of the number of searches necessary to find all three vertices is @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> things become more complicated if the subgraph is a complete graph on four vertices , because there are more alternatives . after two runs of the search , the probability that we have found all four vertices is @xmath72 and the probability that we have found three out of four of them is @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> if we go to three runs , the probability of finding all four vertices becomes @xmath73 and the probability of finding three out of four becomes @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for small subgraphs , a small number of runs of the walk will allow us to find all vertices of the subgraph with high probability .    to provide a different perspective on the proposed evolution unitary @xmath27 , we rephrase the quantum walk in terms of a quantum circuit </S>",
    "<S> in which the procedure of checking an edge to see whether it is marked is a call to a quantum oracle , corresponding to the classical oracle given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : classical_oracle ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum oracle can be interpreted as a unitary operation acting on a tripartite system as @xmath75 for @xmath76 , where the first two subsystems are both @xmath0 dimensional , the last one is from a four - dimensional hilbert space and @xmath77 is the addition modulo four . in this formulation , it becomes clearer what resources are being compared in the quantum and classical cases  the particular resource we are focussing on is the number of oracle calls . to find one pair marked by the oracle from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : oracle ] ) , we would classically ( when we are not allowed to use the interference ) need to query the oracle @xmath78 $ ] times . in the quantum case </S>",
    "<S> , however , we have seen that only @xmath2 queries are needed to find the pair with high probability , because that is the number of steps a quantum walk would need to localize the particle on the marked edge , and , as we shall see , the oracle is called only twice per step .     a quantum circuit ( network ) that implements a single step of scattering quantum walk search , which makes use of the quantum oracle @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the first input corresponds to a quantum walker originally prepared in the state @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the second and third inputs represent the end vertices of the walker s edge state , while the fourth input represents an ancillary processing subsystem prepared in the state @xmath80 given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : oracle_eigenstate ] ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the oracle is incorporated into the scattering quantum walk as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : circuit ] , where in addition to the walking hilbert space we make use of the three ancillary systems that the quantum oracle acts upon . to obtain the information about the actual vertices we use a unitary gate @xmath81 , whose action can be expressed as the action of two controlled operations similar to those given in ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite . on the state @xmath82 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath81 acts as @xmath83    it is useful to prepare the last subsystem in a special state @xmath84 the usefulness can be seen from equality @xmath85 so we see , that the composed operation @xmath86 changes the state @xmath87 to the state @xmath88 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the ancillary systems assist the evolution , but the ancillary systems do not themselves change , making it unnecessary to express them every time . </S>",
    "<S> this means , that this view is isomorphic to the one where we did not make use of the quantum oracle . </S>",
    "<S> as each step of the walk involves only two oracle calls , and with the number of oracle calls being a measure of the complexity of the problem , we conclude that fewer oracle calls are needed in the quantum case than in the classical for @xmath89 .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we considered scattering - quantum - walk searches on several examples of highly symmetric ( complete , bipartite , and @xmath90-partite ) graphs where some of the vertices were special . in particular , the special vertices simply reflected the particle with a phase factor of @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> as is the case here , the symmetry of these graphs led to a significant reduction in the dimensionality of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> for all of the types of graphs we considered , we found a quadratic speedup over the classical search when the phase - shift of special vertices was taken to be @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> we see from our analysis here that if one wants to find an edge , a different phase shift is required .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we introduced a novel application of quantum walks . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , quantum walks are used to find a marked edge , or a marked subgraph , in a complete graph . </S>",
    "<S> we proved that the quantum walk can perform the search ( quadratically ) faster than it is possible classically . </S>",
    "<S> one of the attractive features of our model is that it might be straightforwardly realized in simple scattering experiments . </S>"
