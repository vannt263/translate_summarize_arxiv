    "hard spheres constitute a paradigmatic system for many simple and complex fluids .",
    "steric stabilized colloids , for instance , are suspensions made of colloidal particles coated by short linear polymers suspended in a microscopic solvent fluid . for sufficiently high temperature and/or in the presence of a good solvent , those dressed colloids effectively interact as hard spheres.@xcite    on the other hand , a number of soft colloidal systems are always penetrable at least to a certain extent @xcite .",
    "notable examples include for instance star - shaped @xcite or branched - shaped @xcite polymers where each macromolecue can be roughly regarded as a sphere of a given radius ( the radius of gyration ) , but two particles can clearly interpenetrate to a substantially smaller distance .    a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for a one - dimensional fluid to be a _ nearest - neighbor _ fluid is to be a hard - core fluid , _ i.e. _ , a fluid made of particles which can not penetrate one another due to the existence of an infinite repulsive potential barrier in the pair potential @xmath0 .",
    "nearest - neighbor fluids admit an analytical exact statistical - mechanical solution:@xcite the partition function , equation of state , and correlation functions of any order can be calculated analytically from the knowledge of the pair potential .",
    "this is no longer the case for non - neighbor fluids.@xcite    penetrable spheres ( ps)@xcite can be reckoned as the simplest representation of soft colloids where the range of penetrability can be tuned from zero ( hard spheres ) to infinity ( ideal gas ) .",
    "both limits are amenable to an exact analytical treatment , but the intermediate case is not .",
    "when an attractive , short - range , square well ( sw ) is added to ps , one obtains the so - called penetrable - square - well ( psw ) fluid.@xcite on the one hand , this enriches the model so that it can also account for short - range attractive interactions which are ubiquitous in such systems . on the other hand",
    ", it also complicates the treatment due to possible ruelle instabilities associated with the lack of a well defined thermodynamic limit.@xcite as the width of the well vanishes with a constant area under the well the psw model reduces to what we denote@xcite as the sticky - penetrable - sphere ( sps ) model .",
    "this model was found to be thermodynamically unstable@xcite due to the divergence of the fourth virial coefficient .",
    "in fact , sps model violates the ( sufficient ) condition for stability ( see appendix a in ref .  ) .",
    "we emphasize that various classes of penetrable systems have appeared in the literature with rather different meanings .",
    "the widom  rowlinson model of non - additive hard - sphere mixtures,@xcite for instance , is not associated with a well defined pair potential as in the case of the present study .",
    "likewise , the rikvold  stell ",
    "torquato `` permeable sphere '' model@xcite is defined through a condition on correlation function which is not equivalent to a constant repulsive potential inside the core region . on the contrary , our psw model belongs to the same class of bounded potentials as the gaussian - core models originally proposed by stillnger _ _ et al.__@xcite in the late 1970s and exploited more recently by the dsseldorf@xcite and the cambridge@xcite groups .    in a previous paper,@xcite",
    "we have introduced the psw fluid model and discussed the conditions under which the model is ruelle stable .",
    "in addition , we have also derived an exact low - density expansion up to second order in the radial pair distribution function ( corresponding to the fourth order in the virial coefficient ) which was shown to compete with standard integral equation approximations such as percus ",
    "yevick ( py ) and hypernetted chain ( hnc ) over a wide region of the density - temperature phase diagram .",
    "these exact results , however , fail to reproduce the correct behavior when the concentration is large , due to their low - density character .    the aim of the present paper is to extend the analysis to these more demanding conditions , by using an approximation already successfully exploited in the ps case . in this case",
    "it has been argued@xcite that the exact analytical solution stemming from corresponding hard - sphere particles can be efficiently exploited to implement a low - penetrability approximate solution ( lpa , called lta in ref .  ) .",
    "the basic idea behind the method is that for sufficiently low penetrability , the functional form of the equations derived in the impenetrable case can be smoothly adapted to the penetrable case by `` healing '' a few crucial aspects of the original solution .",
    "building upon this idea , we here show that this methodology can also be applied to the psw case by starting from the corresponding impenetrable counterpart ( _ i.e. _ , the sw potential ) .",
    "we discuss the soundness of this approximation in various ways .",
    "first by comparing the lpa low - density results against the exact low - density expansion which was computed in ref .  .",
    "secondly , by comparing with specialized monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and standard integral equations ( notably py and hnc ) .",
    "we show how lpa properly describes a significant part of the phase diagram with a performance comparable with integral equations at a semi - analytical level .",
    "the introduction of an attractive part in the ps potential opens the route to some interesting questions that we also address in the present paper .",
    "first of all , we question the existence of a fluid - fluid phase separation in addition to the fluid - solid transition , by limiting our analysis within the range of applicability of lpa , that is , we avoid densities so high that a substantial interpenetration among particles is expected .    within the same lpa",
    ", we also investigate modifications on the fisher  widom line , marking the transition from oscillatory to exponential decay regimes for correlation functions , that is known to exist even in the sw one - dimensional fluid.@xcite we find an increase of the exponential decay region and we address the physical motivations behind this .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : we define the psw model in sec .",
    "[ sec : psw ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] we briefly recall the well known general scheme allowing for the exact analytical solution of the class of nearest - neighbor one - dimensional fluids .",

    "the regions in the density - temperature diagram where the lpa is only slightly thermodynamically inconsistent ( and thus expected to be reliable ) are discussed in section [ sec : limits ] , where also an improved version of the approximation is proposed .",
    "section [ sec : mc_ie ] includes a very brief description on the numerical methods ( mc simulations and integral equations ) discussed in the present model .",

    "@xmath13 is the usual step function equal to @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 otherwise .",
    "it also proves convenient to introduce the ratio @xmath17 , which is a measure of the relative depth of the attractive well .",
    "the above potential reduces to the corresponding ps and sw potentials in the limits @xmath18 ( or @xmath12 ) and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "other interesting limiting cases have already been detailed in ref .  .",
    "consider a sw fluid in one dimension : different particles can be assigned an increasing coordinate on the axis line and the only possible configurations are those indicated with a or b in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ( middle panel ) , where either the centers of two different spheres are separated a distance greater than the attractive sw range and behave as hard spheres ( a ) or they are sufficiently close to attract each other ( b ) .",
    "psw spheres , on the other hand , can interpenetrate with some energy cost so they also display configurations such as , for instance , ( c ) or ( d ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ( bottom panel ) .",
    "psw fluids are then effectively a many - body problem and , as such , not amenable to an analytical solution .    in the present paper ,",
    "our analysis will be limited to the case @xmath20 where a well defined thermodynamic limit is ensured.@xcite",

    ", penetrable spheres do not possess any analytical solution even in one dimension .",
    "this is because it is not possible to convolute appropriate laplace transform along a one - dimensional axis , which is the essential feature rendering the short - range one - dimensional models solvable . in turn",
    "this is due to the existence of multiple `` blobs '' formed by interpenetrating spheres so that it is no longer possible to `` order '' them along a line in such a way that they do not cross each other , a key point to the existence of the analytical solution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , middle panel ) .    because of this",
    ", we now turn our attention to a motivated approximation which amounts to assume a slight decrease from an infinite repulsive barrier , an approximation which will be denoted as low - penetrability .",
    "in ref .   we have followed the philosophy of considering a low - density expansion to provide exact analytical results valid up to second order in the rdf @xmath30 and up to fourth order in the virial expansion .",
    "this is a very useful exact limit case to test approximate theories and numerical simulations , but it has the considerable disadvantage of being limited to very low densities .",

    "we have explicitly checked ( not shown ) that for smaller values of the well width @xmath55 , psw results increasingly tend to the sps counterpart , as anticipated .",
    "next we turn to the analysis of thermodynamics within lpa .",
    "as anticipated ( see section [ sec : eos ] ) , the lack of an exact solution gives rise to thermodynamical inconsistencies where compressibility , virial , and energy routes all give rise to different results .",
    "the consistency degree among different routes is a ( partial ) signature of the lpa performance , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : limits ] . in fig .  [ fig : fig6 ] we report the behavior of @xmath155 as a function of the reduced density @xmath211 .",
    "once again , we fix the width of the well @xmath212 and the energy ratio @xmath201 , and consider two different temperatures @xmath199 ( top panel ) and @xmath213 ( bottom panel ) . in the former case",
    "different routes give practically indistinguishable results up to @xmath214 , whereas in the latter a difference is clearly visible at densities higher than @xmath215 with energy , virial , and compressibility routes having decreasing @xmath155 for identical values of @xmath211 .",
    "similar results are observed at the stability edge @xmath202 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "we remark that higher temperatures effectively correspond to higher penetrability , as particles have relatively more attractive energies , as compared to the positive repulsive barrier , and hence they can compenetrate more .",
    "therefore pressure differences among different thermodynamical routes can be reckoned as a rough measure of the breakdown of lpa .",
    "on the other hand , consistency among different routes does not necessarily means `` exact '' results , as they can all converge to the incorrect value .",
    "a comparison with mc numerical simulations is therefore also included in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] and [ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , this suggests that the virial route is the closest to the true value for the pressure , with both compressibility and energy routes always lying on the opposite side with the latter being the farthest from the mc results .    in order to compare with lpa",
    ", we have carefully scanned a wide range of temperatures and densities within the region @xmath216 where lpa provides consistent thermodynamics as remarked .",
    "within this region we found no signature of fluid - fluid transition line as expected . our preliminary numerical results for higher densities , where strong overlapping among different particles is enforced ,",
    "provide a clear evidence of phase separation . as the main emphasis of the present paper is on analytical approximations ,",
    "this point will be discussed in some detail elsewhere .",
    "let us follow the recipe given in sec .",

    "[ fig : fig8 ] we report the quantities @xmath217 and @xmath211 as a function of @xmath164 for @xmath218 and decreasing values of the ratio @xmath167 .",
    "the case @xmath219 is the one addressed in the original fw work on the one - dimensional sw fluid.@xcite we remind that above the fw line , @xmath104 has oscillatory behavior , whereas it is exponentially decaying below it , and it is located in the homogeneous fluid region of the phase diagram , above the critical temperature if phase separation is present .    as the repulsive barrier becomes finite , the region of monotonic behavior increases for large @xmath164 whereas it remains essentially unchanged for lower temperatures .",
    "this is not surprising as penetrability ( _ i.e. _ , finite repulsive barrier ) favors the onset of a critical region .",
    "somewhat more surprising is the fact that this happens in the high- rather than in the low - temperature region .",
    "a similar feature is also appearing in the @xmath27-@xmath105 plane ( see bottom panel ) . in order to test the effect of different width values",
    ", we have repeated the same calculation for @xmath220 .",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] and are in agreement ( in the limit @xmath219 ) with results for the one - dimensional sw fluid presented in ref .   for a hard - core to well - width ratio equal to @xmath221 ( see fig .  1 in ref .  ) .",
    "for this well width the influence of the ratio @xmath167 on the fw line is much less important .",
    "although we have been unable to find a simple physical explanation for this behavior , we remark that the sensitivity of the fw line to the barrier height occurs as the density decreases .",
    "consider for instance the density @xmath222 for models with @xmath218 . in the sw case ( @xmath223 ) the decay of the rdf changes from monotonic to oscillatory",
    "as one increases the temperature and crosses the value @xmath224 . in the case of the psw model with @xmath201 , according to the lpa , the transition takes place at @xmath225 .",
    "if the density is sufficiently low ( @xmath226 for @xmath201 ) , the asymptotic decay of @xmath104 is monotonic for any temperature , while this effect is absent in the impenetrable sw limit .",
    "one might argue that this influence of the energy ratio @xmath167 on the high - temperature branch of the fw line is an artifact of the lpa since the latter approximation is _ a priori _ restricted to low temperatures . on the other hand",
    ", this high - temperature branch also corresponds to low densities , counterbalancing the penetrability effect and making the lpa presumably accurate . as a matter of fact , the fw lines plotted in the top panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] and [ fig : fig9 ] are obtained from the three thermodynamic routes but the three curves are , in each case , indistinguishable each oth ! er . in other words , the fw lines are well inside the regions in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] where the lpa is thermodynamically consistent from a practical point of view .",
    "one - dimensional fluids with nearest - neighbor interactions admit an exact analytical solution for both structural and thermophysical properties with a well defined protocol.@xcite nearest - neighbor interactions , in turn , require a well defined hard - core term in the pair - wise potential preventing superpositions and particle exchanges which is the crucial ingredient necessary for the exact solution .",
    "the absence of the above constraint , on the other hand , allows the presence of critical phase transitions , in spite of the one - dimensional character of the system , which are fully absent in the hard - core counterparts .",
    "effective pair interactions with a soft - repulsive component are well - known features of polymer solutions and colloidal suspensions.@xcite among many different model potentials,@xcite with various degrees of core softness , penetrable spheres ( ps ) stands out for its simplicity.@xcite in this model , the infinite repulsive energy is reduced to a finite one , thus introducing an effective `` temperature '' into an otherwise athermal hard - sphere system .",
    "this potential model lacks of attractive interactions but these can be accounted for in the penetrable square - well ( psw ) companion model where an attractive short - range square - well is added to the ps model.@xcite    at sufficiently low temperatures , thermal energy can not overcome the repulsive barrier and penetrability is low , whereas at high temperatures different particles can interpenetrate to a significant extent .",
    "hence , within this framework , low- and high - temperature and low- and high - penetrability terminology can be used synonymously .    in this work",
    "we have studied structural and thermodynamic properties of the psw model . using a low - penetrability approximation ( lpa ) akin to",
    "that discussed for ps,@xcite we have considered rather interesting issues specific of the presence of attractive interactions ( and thus absent in the ps model ) such as fluid - fluid phase separation or the existence of a fisher - widom line.@xcite this is a pseudo - transition associated with a clear - cut change , from oscillatory to monotonic , in the asymptotic decay properties of the radial distribution function , as transition line is approached , even in those cases where the existence of a critical region is prevented by rigorous theorems ( e.g.the sw one - dimensional fluid ) .",
    "it requires the simultaneous presence of attractive and repulsive energies and hence it can not exist for the simpler ps model    our lpa has been devised to reduce to that of ps in the limit of no well .",
    "we have assessed its performance by comparing it with exact results@xcite in the low - density limit and by comparing with mc simulations and py and hnc integral equation theories for larger densities where exact analytical results do not exist .",
    "we found that it reproduces a significant portion of the @xmath105-@xmath24 parameter space at the level of pair correlation function , the main difference being in the penetrability region @xmath227 . at odds with its square - well counterpart ,",
    "psw thermodynamics depends upon the chosen route in view of the inconsistencies introduced by the lpa .",
    "we have quantified the inconsistencies among virial , compressibility , and energy routes and discussed how they reflect into the computation of the fisher  widom line . in all considered cases",
    ", we found a magnification at large temperatures of the monotonic regime region as penetrability increases and a much smaller , if any , modification , at lower temperatures . in all cases",
    "the fw line is found within the region where lpa is expected to be accurate as thermodynamic inconsistencies are small . within the density region @xmath228",
    ", we have found no sign of a fluid - fluid phase separation , although both fluid - fluid and fluid - solid transitions are expected at higher densities .    in the limit of infinitely narrow and deep well",
    ", psw has been shown to reduce to a penetrable version of baxter adhesive model,@xcite which violates the stability condition set for a well defined thermodynamic limit.@xcite    as the main weaknesses of lpa for the psw stems mainly from a non - adequate representation of the penetrable region @xmath208 , we have then discussed how a simple modification of the radial distribution function in this region gives a significant improvement when tested against mc results under rather demanding conditions .    this paper is part of an on - going effort on psw outlined in our previous work.@xcite future work will address a complementary approximation ( the high - penetrability limit ) and its matching with the lpa discussed in the present paper , so that the entire parameter @xmath105-@xmath24-@xmath27 space can be discussed with some comfortable degree of confidence .",

    "<S> we study structural and thermophysical properties of a one - dimensional classical fluid made of penetrable spheres interacting via an attractive square - well potential . </S>",
    "<S> penetrability of the spheres is enforced by reducing from infinite to finite the repulsive energy barrier in the pair potentials as a consequence , an exact analytical solution is lacking even in one dimension . building upon previous exact analytical work in the low - density limit [ santos _ et al . </S>",

    "<S> e , 051206 ( 2008 ) ] , we propose an approximate theory valid at any density and in the low - penetrable regime . by comparison with specialized monte carlo simulations and integral equation theories , we assess the regime of validity of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the degree of inconsistency among the various routes to thermodynamics and explore the possibility of a fluid - fluid transition . </S>",
    "<S> finally we locate the dependence of the fisher - widom line on the degree of penetrability . </S>",
    "<S> our results constitute the first systematic study of penetrable spheres with attractions as a prototype model for soft systems . </S>"
