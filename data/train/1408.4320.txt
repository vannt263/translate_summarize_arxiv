    "casimir - lifshitz force in an interaction originating from the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and existing between any couple of polarizable bodies .",
    "it was first theoretically derived by casimir in 1948 @xcite in the idealized configuration of two perfectly conducting parallel plates at zero temperature .",
    "later , lifshitz and collaborators generalized the calculation to the case of bodies having arbitrary optical properties and of finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the casimir - lifshitz interaction , experimentally verified for several different geometries @xcite , results from two contributions , one originating from vacuum fluctuations and present also at zero temperature , the other one from purely thermal fluctuations . the latter becomes relevant when the distance separating the bodies is larger than the thermal wavelength @xmath0 , of the order of @xmath1 m at ambient temperature .",
    "this explains why it has been only very recently experimentally observed at thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the situation completely changes out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "it was first theoretically predicted in 2005 that the atom - surface interaction ( usually referred to as casimir - polder force ) is qualitatively and quantitatively modified with respect to thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "new power - law behaviors appear , the force can turn into repulsive ( being only attractive at thermal equilibrium ) and it is strongly tunable by modifying the temperatures involved in the system .",
    "this prediction was verified in 2007 , providing the first experimental observation of thermal effects @xcite .",
    "these results paved the way to a renewed interest in casimir - lifshitz effects out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "in fact , this effect was studied for two slabs @xcite and in presence of atoms @xcite , and more recently several different approaches have been developed to deal with the problem of the force out of thermal equilibrium and heat transfer between two @xcite or more @xcite arbitrary bodies .",
    "the physics of the electromagnetic field out of thermal equilibrium has also stimulated the study of other effects , such as the manipulation of atomic populations @xcite and entanglement @xcite .",
    ", always assumed to be positive .",
    "the gratings , in general made of different materials , are infinite in the @xmath2 plane , and periodic in the @xmath3 direction with the same period @xmath4 .",
    "they have corrugation depths @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , thicknesses @xmath7 and lengths of the upper part of the grating @xmath8 .",
    "this defines the filling factors @xmath9.,width=302 ]    in parallel with the interest in the absence of thermal equilibrium , casimir - lifshitz interactions have been studied in several different geometries , with particular interest in the sphere - plane configuration , the most studied experimentally .",
    "more recently , nanostructured surfaces have been theoretically considered in the contexts of both force @xcite and heat transfer @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the force have been measured between a sphere and a dielectric @xcite or metallic @xcite grating .",
    "the problem we address here for the first time is the calculation of the casimir - lifshitz force out of thermal equilibrium in presence of dielectric gratings , in order to study the combination of non - equilibrium and geometrical effects .",
    "in particular we consider a system made of two different gratings having different temperatures , immersed in an environmental bath at a third temperature .",
    "our calculations can be relevant both to imagine new experiments measuring the casimir - lifshitz force out of thermal equilibrium and in the more general context of the manipulation of the force in micro- and nano - electromechanical systems @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secintro ] we introduce our physical system and provide the notation and main definitions . in sec .",

    "[ secnum ] , we apply these results in order to calculate the force out of thermal equilibrium between two different gratings .",
    "we explore the behavior of the force as a function of the three temperatures and of the geometrical parameters of the gratings , with a specific attention to the appearance and features of repulsion .",

    "[ secconcl ] some conclusive remarks .",

    "we label the two gratings with an index @xmath11 taking values 1 and 2 .",
    "the gratings are infinite in @xmath3 and @xmath12 directions , with periodicity along the @xmath3 axis .",
    "their distance @xmath13 is defined in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and can only take positive values ( i.e. a plane @xmath14 must exist separating the two bodies ) .",
    "the gratings share the same period @xmath4 and have corrugation depth @xmath5 , permittivities @xmath15 in the homogeneous zone , permittivities @xmath16 along the grating zone having thickness @xmath7 , and filling factors @xmath9 ( @xmath8 is defined as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "our physical system is considered in a configuration out of thermal equilibrium ( ote ) .",
    "this means that each body is supposed to be in local thermal equilibrium with a constant temperature @xmath17 .",
    "we also assume that the two gratings are immersed in a radiation bath coming from bounding walls far from the system and having temperature @xmath18 , in general different from the temperatures of the two gratings ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the whole system is considered in a stationary regime so that the three temperatures involved are constant in time .    in @xcite , this assumption has been used to characterize the properties of the source fields ( the ones emitted by the two bodies and coming from the surrounding walls ) in terms of field correlation functions .",
    "this procedure is based on a mode decomposition of the fields , each mode @xmath19 being identified by the direction of propagation @xmath20 along the @xmath21 axis , the polarization index @xmath22 [ assuming the values @xmath23 which respectively correspond to transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes ] , the frequency @xmath24 and the transverse wavevector @xmath25 . in this description ,",

    "[ fig5 ] we plot the ratio between the exact pressure and the pfa results for the four temperature configurations used in fig .",
    "we observe that pfa provides in our range of distances a description of the pressure with a relative error typically well below 20% .",

    "first , we observe that geometrical modifications can tune the pressure by a factor going from 0.5 to 1.6 .",
    "in particular , this region can be fully explored by varying the filling factor between the two admitted extreme values @xmath203 and @xmath202 , i.e. between the two limiting slab - slab configurations . concerning the depth @xmath59 , it also allows a wide variation of the pressure .",
    "we remark that for @xmath59 going to zero we recover the result corresponding to @xmath202 , that is a filled grating . on the contrary , for increasing values of @xmath59",
    ", we see that we approach to a pressure approximately equal to half the value of the pressure for @xmath202 .",
    "this can be interpreted by noticing that roughly speaking at some point the corrugation is so deep that only the upper part ( half of the total surface , being @xmath175 ) contributes to the pressure .",
    "differently , the dependence of the pressure on the period @xmath4 is less pronounced , and absent within our accuracy in the case of a lateral shift between the gratings , not reported in figure .",
    "as we have shown , the filling factor is a promising tool to tailor the behavior of the pressure .",

    "[ secgeopar ] , the filling factor is a promising tool to shift the distance at which the transition between attraction and repulsion takes place .",
    "nevertheless , from an experimental point of view it is more interesting to understand how this transition can be affected by tuning parameters which can be varied during an experiment , such as the three temperatures .",
    "this is topic of this section , where we first consider the case in which the two gratings have a common temperature @xmath228 , in general different from the environmental one @xmath18 . for this configuration ,",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the pressure acting on grating 1 in the reference configuration discussed above as a function of @xmath229 and @xmath18 .",
    "the plot is clearly divided in two regions , corresponding to positive and negative values of the pressure , separated by a solid zero - pressure line . following this line",
    ", we see that repulsion can be obtained only for body temperatures larger than approximately 312k , and that for larger values of @xmath229 a larger region of @xmath18 realizes repulsion .",
    "moreover , we stress the remarkable feature that for values of @xmath229 close to 312k the pressure is approximately zero and almost independent on the environmental temperature for @xmath18 up to approximately 150k .    in the same spirit of our last analysis we now fix only @xmath34 at three different values ( 200 , 300 and 400k ) and let @xmath230 and @xmath18 vary .",
    "the pressure as a function of the two temperatures is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "we see a behavior similar to the one observed in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , that is the existence of a minimum temperature @xmath231 below which repulsion is impossible , as well as a region where the pressure is close to zero almost independently of @xmath18 . as manifest from fig .",

    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , where we fix @xmath233k and plot @xmath232 as a function of @xmath18 . as a general remark ,",
    "when @xmath18 is smaller than @xmath229 the distance @xmath232 tends to a constant value , which decreases from 5.5@xmath195 m to 3@xmath195 m for @xmath229 going from 200 to 400k .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath18 tends to @xmath229 , i.e. the system approaches thermal equilibrium , @xmath232 tends to a vertical asymptote , in accordance to the fact that the pressure is always attractive at thermal equilibrium .",
    "we calculated the casimir - lifsthiz pressure out of thermal equilibrium acting on a 1d dielectric lamellar grating in front of another ( in general different ) dielectric grating . to this aim",
    ", we implemented the fourier modal method in order to derive the scattering operators associated to each individual grating . using the general formalism for casimir - lifshitz force based on scattering matrices , we calculated the pressure acting on a finite fused silica grating in presence of an infinite silicon grating , and also compared our results to the proximity force approximation .",
    "we showed that the combination of geometrical structuring of the surface and absence of thermal equilibrium offers an extremely rich domain of variation both with respect to thermal equilibrium and with respect to planar slabs out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "as in the case of two slabs , non - equilibrium is able to produce a repulsive pressure , whose intensity can be tuned by varying the temperatures as well as the several geometrical parameters associated to each grating .",
    "we also pointed out the presence of regimes in which the pressure is close to zero and almost independent of the environmental temperature .",
    "remarkably , the variations of all the parameters strongly affect the distance at which the transition between attractive and repulsive pressure occurs , allowing to obtain transition distances as low as @xmath234 m .",
    "this feature is indeed promising for the experimental observation of a repulsive force .",
    "moreover , our results can be relevant in the context of force manipulations on micro - mechanical systems @xcite .",
    "finally , an extension of this study to three - body configurations is also promising toward the manipulation of heat transfer @xcite .",
