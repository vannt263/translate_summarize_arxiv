    "when charged nano - particles ( colloidal macroions ) are dispersed in a neutralizing medium the electrostatic potential between the particles is screened by the counterions and is much shorter - ranged than the bare coulomb interaction between the two identical particles @xcite .",
    "derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) theory , for example , predicts that the screened electrostatic contribution to the effective interaction potential between the particles takes the form @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the re - normalized charge , @xmath2 is the dielectric constant of the solvent and @xmath3 is the debye screening length which determines the thickness of the double layer of opposite charge surrounding each colloidal particle .",
    "the dlvo theory also includes a hard - core repulsion , that takes into account the size of the colloids , and dispersion ( van der waals ) attraction . in many situations",
    "the latter plays a minor role and the effective particle - particle interaction can be modeled by a hard - core , repulsive yukawa potential .",
    "if one considers the limit of high charge and/or a low density of particles , one finds that the particles infrequently come into contact and the effect of the hard - core on the properties of the fluid is small . under these circumstances",
    "one may argue  @xcite that eq .",
    ", applied for all separations @xmath4 , is a good zeroth - order model to describe a charged colloidal suspension .",
    "indeed , hynninen and dijkstra  @xcite showed that the phase diagrams of one - component hard - core repulsive yukawa particles could be mapped to those of a point yukawa system for sufficiently large charge on the particles .",
    "the yukawa potential does , of course , arise in a variety of physical situations .",
    "for example , the point yukawa pair potential may also be used to model the interactions between micron sized dust particles in a charge neutral plasma  so called dusty plasmas  @xcite .",
    "the binary point yukawa model has also been used in a recent simulation study of glassy dynamics in low temperature - low density ( classical wigner ) glasses  @xcite .    in a previous study @xcite , we investigated the bulk structure and phase behavior of the two component point yukawa fluid , i.e.  a binary mixture in which all the potentials between the particles are repulsive yukawas .",
    "we found that for certain choices of the parameters in the pair potentials , and at sufficiently high densities , the mixture separates into two fluid phases , one of which is composed predominantly of particles of species 1 and the other phase is predominantly of species 2 . in this paper",
    "we investigate the inhomogeneous mixture adsorbed at a single planar wall . using a simple approximate density functional theory ( dft )",
    ", we calculate the equilibrium fluid density profiles and thermodynamic quantities relevant for investigating surface phase behavior ; the latter are surprisingly rich given the simplicity of the model and dft .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that by making comparisons with results from the accurate hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) approximation the simple random phase approximation ( rpa ) for the pair direct correlation functions @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , in the ornstein - zernike equation @xcite , yields a reasonably accurate approximation for the bulk fluid radial distribution functions @xmath7 at large and intermediate @xmath4 , provided that the fluid is at a state - point fairly close to the fluid - fluid binodal ( specifically , within the lifshitz line @xcite ) .",
    "however , the rpa was found to be inaccurate for determining the fluid correlation functions far from the coexistence region , where one must use the more reliable hnc or other related bulk theories @xcite .",
    "we also found that the rpa provides a good approximation for determining thermodynamic quantities such as the bulk fluid helmholtz free energy .",
    "indeed , the phase diagram resulting from the rpa is in fairly good agreement with that obtained from the hnc  @xcite .    in the present work we use a simple approximate dft that , in bulk , generates the rpa for @xmath5 to investigate the inhomogeneous mixture .",
    "based on the experience from studying the bulk fluid mixture @xcite we expect that the dft should predict with reasonable accuracy the fluid density profiles and adsorption behavior for state points that are close to the binodal . in such cases ,",
    "where a fluid close to fluid - fluid phase coexistence is adsorbed at a planar wall , it is possible for there to be wetting of the wall by the coexisting phase , for some choices of the wall - fluid interaction parameters @xcite . specifically if a mixture rich in particles of species 1 is at a state point close to the coexistence line",
    ", then we may observe wetting of the wall by a thick film of the coexisting phase that is rich in species 2 .",
    "this is indeed what we observe , for several different choices of purely repulsive wall potentials .",
    "furthermore , we find that the present system may exhibit a surface phase transition from a thick to a thin adsorbed wetting film and we examine the dependence of this transition on the specific form chosen for the wall potentials",
    ".    some of the inspiration for the present study comes from the particularly elegant dft studies of wetting pioneered by sullivan  @xcite for a one component fluid , where the fluid pair potential featured a hard - core plus an attractive yukawa tail .",
    "the dft that sullivan used was similar to the one we use here . the hard - core repulsion ( absent in the present system ) was treated by making a local density approximation , and the yukawa attraction treated in a simple mean - field approximation . in a subsequent study of the corresponding binary mixture adsorbed at a hard - wall with exponential wall - fluid attractive potentials ,",
    "telo da gama and evans  @xcite showed that for a particular set of wall - potential and fluid pair - potential parameters  @xcite , the euler - lagrange ( el ) equations arising from the minimization of the density functional yield a single ordinary differential equation ( ode ) that can be integrated directly to determine the equilibrium fluid density profiles .",
    "the benefit of this approach is that not only can the density profiles and surface tension be calculated easily without the need for sophisticated numerical schemes , but also that the criteria for different types of film adsorption and locating wetting transitions could be established directly  @xcite .",
    "we apply an equivalent method to the two component point yukawa model , treated within the present dft , and show , in appendix a , that for a particular set of fluid - fluid and wall - fluid interaction parameters , we may also derive a single ode that determines the equilibrium density profiles .",
    "however , in the present case the restriction on the parameters precludes fluid - fluid phase separation so that wetting must be investigated by solving the coupled el equations .",

    "we investigate adsorption of the model fluid at a planar substrate . a single planar wall exerts the potential @xmath59 on particles of species @xmath22 , where @xmath60 is the cartesian axis perpendicular to the wall .",

    "the hard - wall potential may be modified by adding an extra interaction term for @xmath62 .",

    "this choice of external potential corresponds to the case where the hard - wall carries a ( screened ) charge that is uniformly distributed over the surface .",
    "furthermore this potential allows us to recast the el equations as an ode  @xcite .",

    "note that the yukawa wall potential removes the infinite step discontinuity in @xmath59 at the origin , replacing it by a smooth increase . in both cases",
    "we set the wall potential decay length scale equal to the inter - particle interaction length scale @xmath3 , in order to simplify the model .",
    "this choice therefore precludes any phenomena that may arise from a competition between different length scales in the potentials @xcite .",

    "we find that for the different wall potentials that we considered above within the ( rpa ) dft the location of the pre - wetting line obtained from the functional and the rpa functional are located very close together , especially when the moderately small differences in the location of the binodals obtained within the two theories are taken into account @xcite .",
    "thus we are confident that all of the phenomena that we have observed within the simple rpa theory are at least qualitatively correct . at present",
    "we do not know of any computer simulation results for the binary point yukawa fluid that would confirm this assertion .",
    "although the point yukawa model of a fluid is very simplistic , and may be inappropriate for modeling the wide range of real systems where hard - core effects dominate the physics , its usefulness lies in its ability to incorporate realistic and relatively complex behavior , without the need for an elaborate density functional theory .",
    "we have shown that with a very simple model and functional it is possible to describe rich wetting behavior , which is also reproduced in the results of a more sophisticated functional . in order to study effects arising from an explicit hard - core",
    "one would require another ( hard - sphere ) contribution to the functional e.g.  @xcite , and a significantly greater computational effort to calculate the equilibrium density profiles .",
    "this becomes especially important when we move away from simple planar or spherical geometries to situations where the densities vary in two or even three dimensions .",
    "for example , we have used the binary point yukawa model to study the effective interaction between a large colloidal particle and a thick wetting film adsorbed at a planar wall , and a fluid - fluid interface  @xcite .",
    "the use of the simple rpa functional greatly decreases the computational cost of calculating individual equilibrium profiles , and of establishing the location and nature of phase transitions .",
    "interfacial phase behavior similar to that presented here , i.e.  the existence of a first - order pre - wetting transition and logarithmic growth of thick wetting films has also been observed in other binary systems of soft - core particles namely the gaussian core and star - polymer solutions  @xcite .",
    "these similarities lead us to conclude that the behavior found for the present model should be quite generic to binary mixtures of purely repulsive particles that exhibit fluid - fluid demixing .",
    "finally , we note that since the present dft treatment is purely mean - field , the influence of capillary wave fluctuations in the wetting film interfaces is neglected . in the complete wetting regime fluctuations",
    "merely change the amplitude of the logarithmic growth from @xmath173 to @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the standard dimensionless parameter measuring the strength of the fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "we believe that a treatment taking fluctuations into account would arrive at the same prediction of a first order pre - wetting phase transition . where fluctuations are likely to be more important is in the tri - critical regime where the cross - over from first - order to critical wetting occurs .",
