    "the evolution of superbubbles created by the supernovae ( sne ) and stellar winds of ob associations is a critical determinant of the structure and energetics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the coronal component of the ism , or hot ionized medium ( him ) is believed to originate within such superbubbles and supernova remnants ( snrs ; e.g. , cox & smith 1974 ) , hence the evolution of these structures determines whether and how this hot gas is released into the diffuse him .",
    "models for the ism are strongly dependent on whether the him is a pervasive , dominant component , as envisioned by e.g. , mckee & ostriker ( 1977 ) , or whether it plays a lesser role as favored by , e.g. , slavin & cox ( 1993 ) , returning to a paradigm closer to the two - phase ism of field , goldsmith , & habing ( 1969 ) .",
    "superbubble evolution also directly impacts the relative volumes of enriched , coronal gas in galactic disks vs. halos ( e.g. , shapiro & field 1976 ) .",
    "similarly , superbubbles and their related filaments are thought to provide much of the structure for the diffuse ism , including warm and cold  and the warm ionized medium ( e.g. , kennicutt etal .",
    "superbubble activity is therefore fundamental to the ism phase balance , structure , and kinematics ; and it is also a principal driver of galactic evolutionary processes .",
    "the standard model for the evolution of these superbubbles is an adiabatic , pressure - driven shell with continuous mechanical energy injection ( e.g. , pikelner 1968 ; castor , mccray , & weaver 1975 ) .",
    "the mechanical power @xmath0 is provided by stellar winds and sne of the parent ob association . in this model , an outer shock sweeps up ambient ism into a thin cooled shell , while an inner , reverse shock thermalizes the mechanical energy , thereby generating the hot interior whose pressure drives the shell growth .",
    "it is generally assumed that successive sne can be approximated as a continuous energy injection , and that all the available sn energy is thermalized ( e.g. , mac low & mccray 1988 ) .",
    "the standard , adiabatic model then yields simple analytic relations governing the shell evolution : @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the shell radius and expansion velocity , respectively , @xmath5 is the ambient density , and @xmath6 is elapsed time .",
    "there are several lines of evidence supporting this standard model for superbubble evolution ( see oey 1999 ) : a few young , stellar wind - dominated objects have well - constrained @xmath0 from classification of the stellar populations , and show reasonable consistency with the predicted kinematics ( oey 1996b ) .",
    "in addition , multiwavelength observations of highly active star - forming regions like 30 doradus ( wang 1999 ) and the starburst galaxy ngc 5253 ( strickland & stevens 1999 ) show hot gas morphologically contained within cooler shell structures . higher ionization species like and have been detected in lines of sight through all superbubbles with available observations ( chu etal .",
    "1995 ) , suggesting interface zones between hot and cold gas .",
    "in addition , the superbubble size distribution derived from the standard model is in remarkable agreement with observed size distributions of  shells in the magellanic clouds ( oey & clarke 1997 ; kim etal .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "however , other evidence suggests that superbubble evolution is often not nearly as simple as described by the standard model .",
    "the first problem is that the model overestimates the shell growth rate for young , wind - dominated superbubble nebulae ( oey 1996b ; garca - segura & mac low 1995 ; drissen etal .",
    "this could be due to a systematic understimate in the ambient densities @xmath5 by up to a factor of @xmath7 , or to a similar overestimate in the input power @xmath0 predicted by the assumed stellar mass - loss rates .",
    "secondly , oey ( 1996b ) identified a class of superbubbles that exhibit expansion velocities that are several times higher than predicted , relative to their radii .",
    "most of these also show anomalously bright x - ray emission , which suggests shell acceleration by snr impacts ( chu & mac low 1990 ; oey 1996b ) . in such cases ,",
    "not all the available sn energy will be thermalized to power the shell expansion , thus the effect of discrete sne on shell evolution remains unclear .",
    "clarifying the structure of the ambient medium is clearly essential in determining the origin of these discrepancies .",
    "since most estimates of the ambient @xmath5 for young nebular shells are based on the electron densities , the presence of a massive  shell component could imply a significant underestimate in assumed @xmath5 .",
    "another possibility is that the structure of the ambient medium is highly irregular , providing openings to a network of low - density channels . in that case",
    ", the superbubble could be ruptured in one or more locations , depressurizing the interior and releasing hot gas into these channels .",
    "soft x - ray imaging with _ einstein",
    "_ and _ rosat _ suggests this process in at least one object , dem l152 ( chu etal .  1993 ; magnier etal .",
    "1995 ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "these minor blowouts would then cause accelerated , high - velocity kinematics in excess of the standard model predictions ( e.g. , oey & smedley 1998 ; mac low etal .",
    "expansion into the density gradient perpendicular to galactic disks offers an additional systematic explanation for anomalously fast shell expansion in face - on galaxies ( silich & franco 1999 ) .",
    "in order to examine their interstellar environment in more detail , we therefore obtained  imaging around three nebular superbubbles in the lmc .",
    "all three objects are among those found by oey ( 1996b ) to show anomalously high expansion velocities relative to their radii .",
    "the characteristics of these objects are summarized in table  [ tabsample ] : columns 1 and 2 give their identifications in the  catalogs of davies , elliott , & meaburn ( 1976 ) and henize ( 1956 ) , respectively ; and column  3 gives the shell radius @xmath3 from oey ( 1996b ) , assuming a 50  kpc distance to the lmc .",
    "all three objects contain ob associations in projection , and their stellar content was classified by oey ( 1996a ) .",

    "the nebular gas in all three objects is well - defined , highly circular , and filamentary .",
    "the mcels narrowband frames of dem l25 and dem l50 were flux - calibrated with two longslit spectra of positions in dem l25 .",
    "these were obtained at the ctio 1.5-m telescope on 2001 august 1 under photometric conditions .",
    "we used the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) to construct aperture synthesis imaging of these regions in the 21-cm  line .",
    "as seen in figure  [ figopt ] , dem l25 and l50 are separated by only @xmath13 , so for these targets we mosaicked a single field from 13 pointings .",
    "our field for dem l301 comprises 7 pointings .",
    "we obtained the observations in four configurations : 750a ( 1996 nov 27 ) , 750d ( 1997 jan 57 ) , 1.5c ( 1997 sep 3 ) , and 1.5d ( 1997 mar 2630 ) . excluding the data from the baselines involving antenna  6 , these configurations yield 40 independent baselines ranging from 30 to 1470 m. the 21-cm line observations were carried out for an lmc heliocentric radial velocity @xmath14 .",
    "the bandwidth of 4 mhz was divided into 1024 channels , which were then binned to 512 channels .",
    "these correspond to a velocity coverage @xmath15 , with resolution 1.65 @xmath16 and sensitivity of 2.2 k. we simultaneously observed the 20-cm , 1.380 ghz continuum emission with a bandwidth of 128 mhz and full polarization information .",
    "we observed the primary flux calibrator pks b1934638 at the start and end of each observing run . for phase and amplitude calibration , we observed pks b0454810 and pks b0407658 .",

    "the pointing positions of our new data were adopted to coincide with the central pointings from the survey data .",
    "altogether , these observations yield  imaging at 50  resolution within roughly @xmath18 of each object .",
    "the calibration and mosaicking of the radio data were carried out with miriad software .",
    "our data were transformed to the image plane using superuniform weighting and a gaussian taper of 40 .",
    "we deconvolved the beam using a maximum entropy method , and this was then merged with the atca data and regridded parkes data .",
    "we adopted a flux ratio between the parkes data and our data of 1.2 for dem l25 and l50 , and 1.0 for dem l301 .",
    "the optical emission - line properties of dem l301 are discussed in detail by oey etal .",
    "( 2000 ) , who also present the individual narrowband images of that object used here .",
    "similar ccd narrowband imaging of dem l301 was obtained and discussed by skelton etal .",
    "in addition , oey etal .",
    "( 2000 ) obtained longslit spectrophotometry and compared these with tailored photoionization and shock models , showing that the observed line ratios appear to result from a combination of shock and density - bounded photoionization .",
    "in contrast , dem l25 and l50 emit substantially more  luminosity than apparently can be provided by the stars ( table  [ tabsample ] ) .",
    "this implies an additional ionization mechanism , most plausibly shock heating .",
    "figure  [ figopt]@xmath19 shows a dramatic contrast between dem l25 and l50 in [ ]  emission : while dem l25 shows a ratio of [ ] @xmath20/  @xmath21 , the main shell of dem l50 shows almost no detection in [ ] . there is some [ ]  emission from the snr n186  d , which is the small loop at the north end of dem l50 ( see  3.2 below ) , but lasker ( 1977 ) cites the lack of [ ] emission in the main shell as evidence that n186  d is physically separate from the remainder of the system .",
    "the [ ]  emission from dem l25 is surprising in view of the stellar populations : dem l25 has only a single o9  v star , whereas dem l50 has one o6.5  v star and several late - type o stars .",
    "we would have expected [ ]  emission from both nebulae , since it is even seen in  regions dominated by o9 stars ( hunter 1992 ; hunter & massey 1990 ) .",
    "however , the extremely low ionization parameter in these shell structures is likely to quench the photoionized [ ]  emission in these objects ( e.g. , oey etal .",
    "2000 ; garnett & kennicutt 1994 ) .",
    "the [ ]  from dem l25 is therefore most likely caused by an additional heating mechanism , probably shock excitation .",
    "the nebular kinematics of all three superbubbles have been studied extensively ( e.g. , rosado etal .  1981 ; lasker 1981 ; dopita etal .",
    "1981 ; rosado etal .  1982 ; meaburn , mcgee , & newton 1984 ; rosado etal .  1990 ) .",
    "all three show highly complex nebular velocity structure , and do not exhibit simple uniform expansion .",
    "the complex kinematics were cited as evidence consistent with the suggestion of internal snr impacts to explain the anomalously high velocities ( oey 1996b ) .",

    "it is apparent that the neutral environment varies dramatically among the three objects .",
    "dem l25 and l50 appear to be situated in a large  void , roughly 1.4 kpc in diameter , which apparently corresponds to the supergiant shell lmc  8 ( meaburn 1980 ) .",
    "this structure is also clearly seen in the full  map of the lmc contructed by staveley - smith etal .",
    "( 2001 ) , which combines data from the kim etal .  ( 1998 ) atca survey and the parkes multibeam receiver data . within this void",
    ", there is a patch of  emission corresponding to dem l50 , but no apparent  associated with dem l25 .",
    "figure  [ figd25chan ] shows  maps of the region over six velocity intervals , which are the average over four channels .",
    "the mean velocity is shown in the upper left of each panel .",
    "the environment of dem l301 ( figure  [ figopthi]@xmath23 ) shows neutral gas throughout the region in projection , but our data again show no apparent correspondence in the  distribution with the nebular superbubble ( see below ) .",
    "figure  [ figd301chan ] shows  maps of this region averaged over five velocity channels . hence , despite the similar appearance of the three shells in , their  environments are different to an extreme .",
    "as mentioned above , oey & kennicutt ( 1997 ) found that both dem  l25 and dem  l50 show more  emission than can be accounted for by the late - type o stars present within these objects .",
    "both nebulae might therefore be expected to be radiation - bounded and associated with neutral gas .",
    "the environment of dem l25 is consistent with the superbubble being nestled within a partial  hole ( figure  [ figd25 ] ) , within a region where typically @xmath22()@xmath24 . while some of the emission seen to the ne of dem l25 probably belongs to an unassociated velocity component , the individual channel maps do remain consistent with general  anticorrelation for the superbubble ( figure  [ figd25chan ] ) .",
    "the  scale height @xmath25 of the lmc is dependent on radius , and difficult to determine because of the galaxy s low inclination angle .",
    "kim etal .",
    "( 1998 ) estimated a characteristic @xmath26 pc , which is weighted toward outer radii and assumes that the stars and gas are coupled .",
    "a more classical analysis by kim etal .  ( 1999 ) suggests @xmath27 pc , assuming stars and gas are not coupled .",
    "elmegreen , kim , & staveley - smith ( 2001 ) note a break in the  power spectrum around a scale of 100 pc , which may also indicate a low value of @xmath25 . here",
    "we adopt a value of @xmath28 pc as a compromise estimate .",
    "if the value of @xmath22 ( )  found in the dem l25 environment is characteristic of the ism in this region , our adopted @xmath25 implies an ambient volume density of @xmath29 .",
    "this low value is related to the location of dem l25 within the supergiant shell environment mentioned above .",
    "there is no emission that unambiguously could correspond to a neutral shell of swept - up material , thus it may be that the entire shell is ionized .",
    "as seen in figure  [ figopt ] , dem  l25 shows the highest excitation among the three objects , with [ ] @xmath20/  @xmath21 , despite the fact that dem l25 has the latest - type ob stars of the three nebulae .",
    "the ratio of observed to predicted  luminosity is so high , @xmath30 ( table  [ tabsample ] ) , that an additional ionization mechanism is unavoidable .",
    "this is consistent with the high [ ] /  ratio , and it is therefore less surprising to find no neutral gas component .    figures  [ figopthi]@xmath19 and [ figd25 ] show that on the west side of dem l25 , the superbubble is interacting with an  cloud .",
    "this is apparent both morphologically and from the enhanced optical nebular emission , indicating a density increase in the optical shell as would be expected from a collision .",
    "the [ ] /  ratio is also higher in the interaction zone , ranging around @xmath31 , as would be expected from a ram pressure - induced shock .",
    "the mass of the  cloud is @xmath321.3@xmath33 , as measured within a 230  box centered at 04 53 49.4 , 70 00 12 ( j2000 ) .",
    "figure  [ figd25pvcloud ] shows an e - w position - velocity ( pv ) slice across the cloud , showing essentially a single component with a systemic velocity of 240 @xmath16 .",
    "the velocity dispersion at the interaction zone is about twice as large as for the remainder of the cloud , as is qualitatively expected from a collision .",
    "the surrounding  spatial distribution suggests that the shell is expanding into the cloud , or rather than that the entire superbubble has a systemic velocity in collision with the cloud .",
    "the standard , wind - driven evolution predicts a shell expansion velocity @xmath34 , based on the observed stellar population and shell size ( oey 1996b ) .",
    "this value represents a rough lower limit to the collision velocity , since  kinematic observations by rosado etal .",
    "( 1982 ) show much higher velocity structures that may imply @xmath35 up to 70 @xmath16 .",
    "we note that no kinematic features are seen in the  observations at these high velocities , again arguing that the shell itself is fully ionized .    to the n and ne of dem",
    "l25 is denser  gas ( figure  [ figopthi]@xmath19 ) , which is a southern extension from a major star - forming region with high - density gas about 300 pc to the north ( figures  [ fignhi]@xmath19 and [ figd25 ] ) .",

    "two distinct kinematic components are clearly apparent around 245 and 270 @xmath16 , which undoubtedly correspond to those seen in the unresolved observations by meaburn etal .",
    "these two components are continuously present over most of the emission in the large mass immediately to the ne of dem l25 and contrast with the single component of the cloud to the w. the existence of two , continuous , distinct velocity components is puzzling , but is a common feature that is also seen , for example , in the small magellanic cloud ( staveley - smith etal .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "dem l50 shows an  configuration that is virtually inverse to that of dem l25 .",
    "dem l50 clearly shows associated , plausibly in a neutral shell envelope outside the nebula , while the surrounding environment has a low density . for a single @xmath36 channel ,",
    "our 3@xmath37 limit is 2.0@xmath38 , although the effective detection limit depends on the kinematic range of the structure .",
    "binning over four channels ( @xmath39 ) as shown in , e.g. , figure  [ figd25chan ] gives a nominal detection limit of 4.0@xmath40 .",
    "this limiting ambient  column density corresponds to a volume density of @xmath41 , an extremely low value that is again associated with the interior of the supergiant shell environment .",
    "figure  [ figd50 ] shows the excellent spatial correspondence of the  ( image ) and @xmath22 ( )  ( contours ) maps .",
    "the total integrated emission of 282 jy @xmath16 within a 610  box implies a total  mass of 1.7@xmath42 for this material . for comparison ,",
    "the ambient density of 1.4 @xmath43 estimated by oey ( 1996b ) and 50 pc radius imply a swept - up mass of 1.6 @xmath44 .",
    "this therefore suggests that the ambient density was underestimated by an order of magnitude from the  emission .",

    "their patchy  remains consistent with the optical filaments corresponding to incipient blowout features or material accelerated by snr impacts , as has been previously suggested .",
    "the lack of correspondence between the nebular and  kinematics is more problematic for dem l50 , although the dominant  and  components are broadly consistent with each other .",
    "the  velocity profile suggests that the neutral component may correspond to the approaching side of the shell .",

    "<S> the ambient interstellar environment of wind- and supernova - driven superbubbles strongly affects their evolution , but its properties are rarely well - determined . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore obtained  aperture synthesis imaging of the environment around three similar , optically - selected superbubble nebulae in the large magellanic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting  maps show that the ambient gas distribution around these superbubbles differ to an extreme : dem l25 shows no neutral shell component , but is nestled within an  hole ; dem l50 shows a massive neutral shell component , but is otherwise within an  void ; and dem l301 shows no correspondence at all between the optical nebula and  distribution . </S>",
    "<S> there is also poor correspondence between the  and optical kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> these results strongly caution against inferring properties of the ambient neutral environment of individual superbubbles without direct observations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , all three objects show some evidence of shock activity .    2cm^-2    # 1to 0pt#1 </S>"
