    "a major problem in numerical relativity that is currently attracting considerable interest is the global treatment of entire asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "this is relevant both to the modelling of the gravitational radiation emitted by compact astrophysical sources , and to several questions in mathematical relativity such as the nonlinear stability of black holes and the quantitative asymptotic behaviour of perturbations of such spacetimes .    in the standard approach based on the cauchy formulation ,",
    "one truncates the spatial domain at a finite distance from the source , where boundary conditions must be supplied ( see @xcite for a review ) . apart from being compatible with the einstein constraint equations and yielding a well - posed initial - boundary value problem",
    ", these boundary conditions must carefully take into account the propagation of gravitational radiation .",
    "for instance , crude choices of boundary conditions are known to lead to incorrect results on radiation tails in the evolution of perturbed black hole spacetimes @xcite . recently , improved absorbing boundary conditions that minimize spurious reflections of gravitational radiation have been derived and implemented @xcite .",
    "while constituting a significant improvement , this approach still relies on the assumption that the einstein equations may be linearized about a given background spacetime so that incoming and outgoing radiation can be identified  an assumption that may not always be valid @xcite . in the full nonlinear theory",
    "there is no satisfactory quasi - local definition of a gravitational energy flux at a finite distance from the source @xcite .",
    "this fact also complicates the extraction of gravitational radiation in an invariant manner .",
    "gravitational radiation is only unambiguously defined at future null infinity @xmath0@xcite .",
    "thus it is very desirable to include @xmath0 in the computational domain .",
    "there are several ways of doing this .",
    "one approach is characteristic evolution , whereby spacetime is foliated by null hypersurfaces that can be compactified towards @xmath0(see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this works well in the far field but characteristic foliations are ill behaved in strong - field regions due to the formation of caustics in the null congruences generating the hypersurfaces .",
    "a compromise is cauchy - characteristic matching , where a cauchy evolution in the interior is matched to a characteristic evolution in an exterior region . in @xcite this has recently been applied to the _ a posteriori _ extraction of gravitational radiation from a cauchy evolution ( with finite outer boundary ) of a binary black hole coalescence .",
    "a more efficient solution is a foliation of spacetime into hyperboloidal hypersurfaces , which are everywhere spacelike but approach future null infinity rather than spacelike infinity .",
    "such surfaces are not cauchy surfaces  the foliation covers only the region to the future of some initial hyperboloidal hypersurface but not , for instance , the region around spacelike infinity .",
    "this is not a serious disadvantage for the applications we have in mind as we are mainly interested in computing the gravitational radiation at @xmath0and studying the late - time behaviour of perturbations .",
    "hyperboloidal foliations have the advantage of being as flexible as standard cauchy foliations in the interior , so that a variety of gauge conditions can be used that have been known to be successful in strong - field situations . in @xcite friedrich reformulated the einstein equations for a conformally rescaled metric in such a way that they are manifestly regular at @xmath0 .",
    "this symmetric hyperbolic system is larger than the actual einstein equations , e.g.  it contains evolution equations for the weyl curvature . for reviews of the theoretical development as well as numerical implementations ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "perhaps most relevant to the present work is an axisymmetric reduction of the regular conformal field equations by frauendiener and hein @xcite that was applied to the numerical evolution of minkowski spacetime and the boost - axisymmetric solutions of bik and schmidt @xcite .    despite these successes , most recent work in numerical relativity has used formulations of the einstein equations ( usually on truncated cauchy hypersurfaces ) rather than the regular conformal field equations .",
    "for this reason , it is worth investigating whether some formulation of the einstein equations themselves can be adapted to hyperboloidal foliations reaching out to @xmath0 . as for the regular conformal field equations",
    ", one applies a conformal transformation to the metric in order to map @xmath0to a finite coordinate location in a compactified coordinate system , where the conformal factor vanishes .",
    "when written in terms of the conformal metric , the einstein equations contain inverse powers of the conformal factor , terms that are singular at @xmath0 .",
    "numerical implementations must face the question of how to deal with these formally singular terms , which may be potential sources of instabilities .",
    "one proposal for solving the einstein equations on hyperboloidal slices was developed by zenginolu @xcite .",
    "it combines a conformal transformation of the spacetime metric ( where the conformal factor can essentially be freely specified ) with a certain choice of gauge source functions for the einstein equations in ( generalized ) harmonic gauge @xcite .",
    "preliminary numerical results on spherically symmetric evolutions of schwarzschild spacetime were reported in section 2.5 of @xcite .",
    "however , it is not yet clear how the formally singular terms at @xmath0are to be evaluated numerically in more general situations .",
    "here we follow a different approach due to moncrief that is based on an adm - like @xcite formulation of the einstein equations with a constant - mean - curvature ( cmc ) slicing condition . in @xcite",
    "we showed explicitly how the formally singular terms in the evolution equations at @xmath0can be evaluated there in terms of conformally regular geometric data .",
    "the constraint equations that occur in this approach were solved numerically in @xcite and initial data on cmc slices describing various configurations of single and binary black holes were constructed .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the evolution problem .",
    "we assume spacetime to be axisymmetric in order to speed up the code so that different ways of treating @xmath0numerically can be experimented with .",
    "we apply the ideas of @xcite to an earlier axisymmetric evolution scheme on cauchy slices @xcite ( see also @xcite for related schemes ) .",
    "the objective of the paper is to show that long - term stable evolutions are possible , including gravitational radiation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : formulation ] we explain our notation and gauge choices and obtain the constraint and evolution equations .",
    "particular emphasis is placed on how the formally singular evolution equations can be regularized at @xmath0 . in section [ s : numericalmethod ]",
    "we describe our numerical method for solving these equations .",

    "next , a gravitational perturbation is included .",

    "it seems likely , however , that a finite - difference method of higher than fourth order or a pseudospectral method will need to be used in order to reach the computational accuracy needed to study tails .",
    "although our multigrid solver has optimal computational complexity ( linear in the number of unknowns ) @xcite , the fact that our formulation contains elliptic equations is a major drawback on the computational speed .",
    "this is likely to be even more severe in the case without spacetime symmetries . from this point of view , a hyperbolic formulation such as the one by zenginolu @xcite seems advantageous .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether the methods of @xcite can be applied to that formulation as well so that regular versions of the evolution equations at @xmath0are obtained .    in this first study we imposed axisymmetry in order to be able to experiment with different numerical treatments of @xmath0more quickly .",
    "the next step will be the extension to spacetimes without any symmetries .",
    "as far as the numerical stability of @xmath0is concerned , we do not expect any new difficulties here because unlike spherical symmetry , axisymmetry already shares with the non - symmetric case what we believe are the key challenges , namely the existence of a dimension tangential to the conformal boundary and the presence of gravitational radiation .",
