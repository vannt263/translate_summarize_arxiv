    "one of the important questions in acceleration of cosmic particles is the fractions of energy that go into acceleration of electrons and protons ( and other ions ) . in this paper",
    ", we investigate this question for acceleration by plasma wave turbulence , a second order fermi acceleration process , which we call stochastic acceleration ( sa ) .",
    "the theory of sa has received little attention in high energy astrophysics except in solar flares where it has achieved significant successes during the past few years .",
    "the turbulence or plasma waves required for this model are presumably generated during the magnetic reconnection which energizes the flares .",
    "the first application of sa was to the acceleration of protons and other ions to explain the observed nuclear gamma ray lines from solar flares ( see e.g ramaty 1979 ; miller & roberts 1995 )",
    ". combining with the nuclear reaction rates ( ramaty , kozlovsky & lingenfelter 1975 ; 1979 ; see also kozlovsky , murphy & ramaty 2002 ) and a magnetic loop model , hua , lingenfelter and ramaty ( 1987a ; 1987b ; 1989 ) showed that the sa model can provide natural explanations for the many observed features in the 1 to 7 mev range .",
    "later this model was also investigated in the acceleration of electrons in several studies ( miller & ramaty 1987 ; bech , schlickeiser & steinacker 1989 ; miller , larosa & moore 1996 ; park & petrosian 1995 and 1996 ) , and the first quantitative comparison of predictions of this model with the observed hard x - ray ( 10 to 200 kev ) spectra in some solar flares was carried out by hamilton & petrosian ( 1992 ) . with",
    "a more detailed modeling , park , petrosian & schwartz ( 1997 ) showed that the sa of electrons by some generic turbulent plasma waves can reproduce the many spectral breaks observed over a broad energy range , from tens of kev to @xmath5 mev , in the so - called electron dominated flares via the bremsstrahlung process ( rieger , gan & marschhuser 1998 ; petrosian , mctiernan & marschhuser 1994 ) .    the strongest evidence supporting the sa model comes from the _ yohkoh _ discovery of impulsive hard x - ray emission from the top of a flaring loop , in addition to previously known emission from loop foot - points ( fps for short .",
    "masuda et al . 1994 ; masuda 1994 ) .",
    "the presence of the loop - top ( lt for short ) emission requires temporary trapping of the accelerated electrons at the top of the loop where the reconnection is taking place .",
    "the turbulence required for sa will naturally accomplish this by repeated scatterings of the particles ( petrosian & donaghy 1999 ) .",
    "more importantly , an analysis of a larger sample of _ yohkoh _ flares ( petrosian , donaghy & mctiernan 2002 ) has shown that the lt emission is a common property of all flares , and a preliminary investigation of _ rhessi _ data appears to confirm this picture ( liu et al .",
    "finally , a third and equally important evidence in support of the sa model comes from the spectra and relative abundances of the flare accelerated protons and other ions observed at 1 au from the sun ( mazur et al . 1992 ; reames et al . 1994 ; miller 2003 ) .",
    "these several independent lines of arguments have established the sa as the leading model for solar flares .",
    "this may be also true in many other astrophysical nonthermal sources .",
    "thus , a more detailed investigation of the sa model and its comparison with observations are now fully warranted .",
    "in particular , the sa of electrons on the one hand and protons and other ions on the other are investigated separately , a unified treatment and comparison with the total nonthermal radiative signatures of all species have not been carried out yet .",
    "the purpose of this investigation is to obtain the relative acceleration of electrons and protons from the thermal backgrounds of solar flare plasmas with the same spectrum of turbulence .",
    "we will present some general results of the model and qualitative comparisons with observations .",
    "more detailed comparisons with observations and the acceleration of other ions , such as the anomalous overabundance of the flare accelerated @xmath6he , will be addressed in subsequent papers .",
    "specifically , we will address the energy partition between the flare accelerated electrons and protons .",
    "observationally , in some flares , or during the earlier impulsive phase of most flares , there is little evidence for gamma - ray lines and therefore proton acceleration .",
    "these are called electron dominated cases . in the majority of solar flares",
    "the energy partition favors electrons but there are a significant fraction of flares where more energy resides in protons than in electrons in their respective observed energy bands .",
    "the ratio of energy of the observed electrons ( with @xmath7 kev range ) to that of protons ( with @xmath8 mev range ) in solar flares varies approximately from 0.03 to 100 ( see e.g. a compilation by miller et al .",
    "1997 ) . in what follows",
    ", we will use solar flare plasma conditions but the formalism described here will be applicable to other astrophysical sources .    in   [ sa ]",
    "we describe the general theory of sa and argue that in most cases , the fokker - planck ( f - p ) equation can be reduced to the diffusion - convection equation with the corresponding coefficients given by pitch angle averaged combinations of the f - p coefficients . in   [ cep ] , we study the resonant interactions of electrons and protons with parallel propagating waves in a pure hydrogen plasma , and calculate the resultant f - p coefficients and acceleration parameters for interactions with a power law turbulence spectrum of the wavenumber .",
    "the new and surprising result here is that the proton acceleration is suppressed by a barrier in its acceleration rate in the intermediate energy range .",
    "this is what is required by observations of electron dominated cases , but as we will show this barrier is too strong and makes the acceleration of protons unacceptably inefficient relative to the electron acceleration , except for in very weakly magnetized plasmas . in ",
    "[ ephe4 ] we point out that this difficulty can be alleviated by a more complete description of the dispersion relation which includes the effects of helium ions and by an inclusion of the effects of the thermal damping of the turbulence at high wavenumbers .",
    "the presence of an appropriate amount of fully ionized helium introduces an extra wave branch which lowers the barrier and the thermal damping steepens the turbulence spectrum toward high wavenumbers , making the acceleration of electrons and protons more in agreement with observations .",
    "the results presented here are summarized in   [ discs ] and",
    "their applications to solar flare observations are discussed qualitatively .",
    "some useful approximate analytical expressions for the interaction rates are presented in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we present the general theory of sa and show that in most astrophysical situations , the diffusion - convection equation is adequate to address the particle acceleration processes .",
    "the study of sa in a magnetized plasma starts from the collisionless boltzmann - vlasov equation and the lorentz force ( schlickeiser 1989 ) . in the quasilinear approximation",
    ", it can be treated by the f - p equation ( e.g. kennel & engelmann 1966 ) : @xmath9+{\\partial \\over\\partial   \\mu}\\left[d_{\\mu\\mu}{\\partial f\\over\\partial \\mu } +   d_{\\mu p}{\\partial f\\over\\partial p}\\right ] -{1\\over p^2}{\\partial\\over \\partial p}(p^2\\dot{p}_lf ) + s , \\label{fpeq}\\ ] ] where the wave - particle interaction is parameterized by the f - p coefficients @xmath10 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath11 is the gyro - phase averaged particle distribution , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the spatial coordinate along the field lines , the velocity , the pitch angle cosine , and the momentum of the particle , respectively .",
    "the energy loss ( minus systematic energy gains , if any ) processes are accounted for by @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the source function .    for weak turbulence ( @xmath18 ) ,",
    "as is the case for solar flares , the f - p coefficients can be evaluated by assuming that the particles and waves are coupled via a resonant process .",
    "the acceleration of particles at a given energy is then dominated by interactions with certain specific wave modes , e.g. the alfvn or whistler waves . for a study of acceleration in a narrow energy band",
    "it is usually sufficient to consider waves in a narrow frequency range ( miller & ramaty 1987 ) . in order to address the energy partition between electrons and ions , however , one has to calculate the particle acceleration over the whole energy range .",
    "for example , the alfvn waves can efficiently accelerate ions but not nonrelativistic electrons .",
    "models with pure alfvnic turbulence are not adequate to address the energy partition of accelerated particles in solar flares and many other astrophysical plasmas , especially for the acceleration of particles from a thermal background . for the acceleration of such low energy particles interactions with turbulent plasma waves extending over a broad range of wavenumbers ( and frequencies ) must be considered .",
    "we consider here interactions with a broad spectrum of plasma waves propagating along a static background magnetic field .",
    "the interactions of parallel propagating waves with electrons are described fully by dung & petrosian ( 1994 ) ( dp94 ) and pryadko & petrosian ( 1997 ) ( pp97 ) ( see also steinacker & miller 1992 ) .",
    "we will use their formalism and evaluate the relative rates of interaction and acceleration of electrons and protons in cold but fully ionized plasmas .",
    "waves propagating parallel or anti - parallel to the large scale magnetic field in a uniform plasma have two normal modes that are polarized circularly ( sturrock 1994 ) . because their electric fields are perpendicular to their corresponding wave vectors , the waves are also referred to as transverse waves .",
    "the dispersion relation for these waves in a cold plasma is ( see dp94 ) @xmath19\\ , , \\label{dispg}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the plasma frequencies and the nonrelativistic gyro - frequencies of the background particles ( with charges @xmath22 , masses @xmath23 and number densities @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath25 stands for the large scale magnetic field , @xmath26 is the speed of light , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the wave frequency and wavenumber , respectively .",
    "one of the important parameters characterizing a magnetized plasma is the ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the electron nonrelativistic gyro - frequency : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the elemental charge unit and the electron mass , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath4 is small for a strongly magnetized plasma .    a particle with a velocity @xmath33 ( lorentz factor @xmath34 ) and a pitch angle cosine @xmath14 interacts most strongly with waves satisfying the resonance condition : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is for the harmonics of the gyro - frequency ( not to be confused with the background particle number densities @xmath24 ) , @xmath27 and @xmath37 are the wave frequency and the parallel component of the wave vector in units of @xmath3 and @xmath38 , respectively ( we will use these units in the following discussion unless specified otherwise and in our case @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 is the particle gyro - frequencies in units of @xmath3 ; @xmath42 for electrons and @xmath43 for protons , where @xmath44 is the proton mass ( for more details see also dp94 ) .",
    "one notes that low energy particles mostly resonate with waves with high wavenumbers and only relativistic particles interact with large scale waves with low frequencies .",
    "the resonant wave - particle interaction can transfer energy between the turbulence and particles with the details depending on the particle distribution and the spectrum and polarization of the turbulence .",
    "the evaluation of the f - p coefficients requires a knowledge of the spectrum of the turbulence . following previous studies ( dp94 ;",
    "pp97 ) we will first assume a power law distribution of unpolarized turbulent plasma waves .",
    "for unpolarized turbulence , the amplitudes of the waves only depend on @xmath28 .",
    "then we have @xmath45 for @xmath46 ( _ i.e. _ a large scale cutoff ) , where the turbulence spectral index @xmath47 .",
    "for a given turbulence energy density @xmath48 , @xmath49 , presumably larger than the inverse of the size of the acceleration region , determines the maximum energy that the accelerated particles can reach and the characteristic time scale of the interaction .",
    "the general features of this situation have been explored in the papers cited above . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we briefly summarize the key results here .",
    "the f - p coefficients can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 the sum over @xmath52 is for the resonant interactions discussed in the previous section .",
    "the characteristic interaction time scale for each of the charged particle species is @xmath53 with that for electrons given by ( see dp94 ) : @xmath54(q-1)k_{\\rm min}^{q-1}\\ , .",
    "\\label{taup}\\ ] ]    in general , the f - p coefficients have complicated dependence on the turbulence spectral index @xmath55 , the plasma parameter @xmath4 and the energy and pitch angle of the particles",
    ". the exact solution of the full f - p equation is a difficult task .",
    "fortunately under certain conditions considerable simplifications are possible .",
    "these conditions are defined by the relative values of the three f - p coefficients .",
    "the pitch angle change rate of the particles is proportional to @xmath56 , while the momentum or energy change rate is proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "as evident from equation ( [ coeff ] ) the behavior of @xmath58 is intermediate between the two .",
    "the relative values of the f - p coefficients determine the type of approximations that can be used for solving the f - p equation .",
    "we now show that for most conditions reasonable approximations lead to the well known transport equation ( eq . [ [ dceq ] ] ) . in order to justify these approximations",
    "it is convenient to define two ratios of the coefficients : @xmath59 we will show in the following sections , for most energies and pitch angles both @xmath60 , which means that @xmath61 . under these conditions",
    "the particles are scattered frequently before being significantly accelerated and the accelerated particle distribution is nearly isotropic .",
    "then the pitch angle averaged particle distribution function @xmath62 satisfies the well known diffusion - convection equation ( see e.g. kirk , schneider & schlickeiser 1988 ; dp94 ; pp97 ) .    in this study",
    "we are interested in the relative acceleration of electrons and protons which is not sensitive to the detailed geometry or the inhomogeneities of the source .",
    "therefore we can assume a homogeneous and finite ( size @xmath63 ) source , or alternatively confine our discussion to spatially integrated spectra .",
    "in this case we can treat the spatial diffusion or advection of the particles by an energy dependent escape term .",
    "then the above mentioned equation is reduced to @xmath64 -{n\\over t_{\\rm esc } } + q\\ , , \\label{dceq}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the particle kinetic energy , @xmath66 , @xmath67 describes the net systematic energy loss , and @xmath68 is the total injection flux of particles into the acceleration region .",
    "@xmath69 describing the diffusion in energy is related to @xmath70 and defines the acceleration time , and @xmath71 is related to the scattering time @xmath72 : @xmath73 note that equation ( [ dceq ] ) describes the energy diffusion with two terms , @xmath69 and the direct acceleration rate : @xmath74    there are several important features in the diffusion coefficients which we emphasize here .",
    "\\1 ) the first is that in the _ extremely relativistic limit _ the diffusion coefficients ( and their ratios ) for protons and electrons are identical and assume asymptotic values such that both of the ratios are much less than one",
    ". therefore equations ( [ dceq ] ) , ( [ scat ] ) and ( [ accel ] ) are valid .",
    "( strictly speaking , this is not true for very strongly magnetized plasmas @xmath75 where one gets @xmath76 .",
    "see eq . [ [ coeff ] ] )    \\2 ) the second is that _ at low energies _ , as pointed out by pp97 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are not necessary less than one , especially for plasmas with low values of @xmath4 . in the extreme case of @xmath79 , three of the four diffusion terms in equation ( [ fpeq ]",
    ") can be ignored . again , if we assume a finite homogeneous region , or integrate over a finite inhomogeneous source , the resultant equation becomes similar to equation ( [ dceq ] ) .",
    "now because of the lower rate of pitch angle scatterings , the escape time may be equal to the transit time @xmath80 , the other transport coefficients @xmath69 and @xmath67 ( and consequently the accelerated particle spectra ) may depend on the pitch angle , and the assumption of isotropy may not be valid .",
    "however , as can be seen in the next section ( figures [ fig5.ps ] and [ fig6.ps ] ) , these coefficients change slowly with @xmath14 , except for some negligibly small ranges of @xmath14 , so that the expected anisotropy is small .",
    "in addition , at lower energies coulomb scatterings become increasingly important and can make the particle distribution isotropic . in many cases , especially for plasmas",
    "not completely dominated by the magnetic field ( _ i.e. _ for @xmath81 ) one can neglect the small expected anisotropy and integrate the equation over the pitch angle , in which case the transport equation becomes identical to equation ( [ dceq ] ) except now @xmath82 where `` @xmath83 '' denotes averaging over the pitch angle .",
    "\\3 ) it is easy to see that one can combine the above two sets of expressions ( eq . [ [ scat]]-[[accel2 ] ] ) for the acceleration rates ( or time scales ) and the escape times at the nonrelativistic and extremely relativistic cases as @xmath84 and @xmath85 the first expression in equation ( [ tacclall ] ) is valid at low values of @xmath86 and @xmath4 and the second at higher energies and in weakly magnetized plasmas .",
    "however , it turns out that at extremely relativistic energies and in weakly magnetized plasmas ( @xmath87 ) , independent of other conditions , @xmath88 and the first expression can be used .",
    "these expressions and equation ( [ dceq ] ) then describe the problem adequately for most purposes in high energy astrophysics , in particular for solar flares , the focus of this paper .",
    "\\4 ) finally , in certain cases , especially in the intermediate energy range the quantity @xmath89 appearing in equations ( [ accel ] ) and ( [ tacclall ] ) can be small .",
    "the acceleration rate can be reduced dramatically when both @xmath77 and @xmath90 are much less than one and @xmath91 . from the definitions of these ratios and expressions for the f - p coefficients ( eqs .",
    "[ [ r1 ] ] , [ [ r2 ] ] and [ [ coeff ] ] ) it is clear that if there were only one resonant interaction one would have @xmath92 and there would be no acceleration .",
    "thus , strictly speaking the use of equation ( [ dceq ] ) with interactions involving only one wave mode ( say the alfvn ) is incorrect .",
    "however , as we will show in   [ dispep ] there are always at least two resonant interactions in unpolarized turbulence , in which case @xmath93 so that the acceleration rate is finite .",
    "but if one of the interactions is much stronger than the others , @xmath89 can be small . in the next section",
    ", we will show some examples where this is true ( figure [ fig5.ps ] ) and that this happens at the intermediate values of energy ( figure [ fig6.ps ] ) .",
    "the acceleration rate is then reduced greatly .",
    "the much lower acceleration rate at the intermediate energies compared to the higher rates in the nonrelativistic and extremely relativistic limits introduces an acceleration barrier .",
    "as we shall see that in the intermediate energy range the behaviors of protons and electrons are quite different and a much stronger acceleration barrier appears for protons .      to determine the distributions of the accelerated protons and electrons by solving equation ( [ dceq ] ) with the above formalism , in addition to the transport coefficients @xmath69 , @xmath94 and @xmath71 , we need to specify the loss term @xmath95 . for electrons the loss processes are dominated by coulomb collisions at low energies and by synchrotron losses at high energies : @xmath96\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 cm is the classical electron radius and @xmath98 is a reasonable value in our case ( see leach 1984 ) .",
    "the ion losses in a fully ionized plasma are mainly due to coulomb collisions with the background electrons and protons ( post 1956 ; ginzburg & syrovatskii 1964 ) . for electron - ion collisions , we have @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the mean thermal velocity of the background electrons in units of @xmath26 and @xmath101 is the boltzmann constant . for proton - ion collisions , which are important for ions with even lower energies , we have ( spitzer 1956 ) @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the mean thermal velocity of the background protons in units of @xmath26 .",
    "these loss processes dominate at different energies and we can define a loss time @xmath104 .      we will use the impulsive phase conditions of solar flares for our demonstration . in this case , we can assume that the system is in a steady state because the relevant time scales are shorter than the dynamical time ( the flare duration ) .",
    "we also assume the presence of a constant spectrum of turbulence .",
    "we are interested in the acceleration from a thermal background plasma , therefore , a thermal distribution is assumed for the source term @xmath105 . as described above , equation ( [ dceq ] ) may not be valid at low ( kev ) energies where @xmath106 .",
    "however , for solar flare conditions and in the kev energy range , coulomb scatterings become important ( @xmath107 , see hamilton & petrosian 1992 ) . in this case @xmath108 and the particle distribution will be nearly isotropic at all energies .",
    "we therefore calculate the acceleration rate with the second expression of equation ( [ tacclall ] ) and solve equation ( [ dceq ] ) to get the distributions of the accelerated particles over all energies .",
    "to appreciate the relevant physical processes , one can compare the acceleration time with the escape and the loss time .",
    "we are mostly interested in the energy range above the energy of the injected particles .",
    "so the source term is not as important in shaping the spectrum as the other terms . in the energy band where the escape and loss terms are negligible , from the flux conservation in the energy space",
    ", one can show that @xmath109 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the acceleration terms are negligible , no acceleration occurs .",
    "when the escape time becomes much shorter than the acceleration time and both of them are much shorter than the loss time , particles escape before being accelerated .",
    "this results in a sharp cutoff in the particle distribution at the energy where @xmath110 .",
    "when the escape time is long and the loss time is much shorter than the acceleration time , one would then expect a quasi - thermal distribution for the coulomb collisional losses ( hamilton & petrosian 1992 ) and a sharp high energy cutoff for the synchrotron losses ( park , petrosian & schwartz 1997 ) .",
    "power - law distributions can be produced only in energy ranges where the loss term is small and the acceleration and escape times have similar energy dependence .",
    "the normalization of the steady state particle distributions is determined by their rates of acceleration , escape and injection .",
    "the injection rates depend on the geometries of the reconnection and the turbulent acceleration site and on possible contributions of the charged particles to reverse currents which must exist when a net charge current leaves the acceleration site . a more detailed time",
    "dependent treatment is required to determine the relative normalization .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the paper and will be dealt with in the future .",
    "here we concentrate on the relative shapes of the electron and proton spectra in the lt and fp sources .",
    "we will assume that the injection flux @xmath111 s@xmath112 @xmath113 for both electrons and protons ( see also   [ discs ] ) .",
    "in the steady state this is equal to the flux of the escaping particles @xmath114 . since the escaping particles lose most of their energy at the fps , instead of @xmath115 we will show the effective particle distribution for a thick target ( complete cooling ) fp source , which is related to the corresponding lt distribution @xmath116 via ( petrosian & donaghy 1999 ) : @xmath117",
    "in this section we describe the relative acceleration of electrons and protons in cold , fully ionized , pure hydrogen plasmas .",
    "this is an approximation because all astrophysical plasmas contain some helium and traces of heavy elements . ignoring the effects of helium ( trace elements",
    "will , in general , have no influence on the following discussion ) and adopting a turbulence spectrum of a single power law of the wavenumber simplify the mathematics and allow us to demonstrate the differences between the acceleration rates of electrons and protons more clearly .",
    "moreover , in some low temperature plasmas , most of the helium may be neutral and not be involved in the sa processes .",
    "the results presented here will be a good approximation .",
    "pure hydrogen plasmas can also be realized in terrestrial experiments to test the theory .",
    "the formalism can also be easily generalized to the case of electron - positron plasmas and to more complicated situations . in the next section",
    "we will present our results for plasmas including about 8% by number of helium and for turbulence with a more realistic spectrum .      in a pure hydrogen plasma ,",

    "we now introduce an additional cutoff at high wavenumbers presumably caused by thermal damping .",

    "this is beyond the scope of the current investigation . in stead",
    ", we make some reasonable assumptions on these breaks :    _ the low @xmath28 or large scale cutoff _ @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the largest scale of the turbulence , which must be less than the size @xmath63 of the region , and is most likely much less than it .",
    "to accelerate particles to high energies , we also need @xmath240 . for most waves we choose @xmath49 as before , i.e. by the value of the highest energy we want the particles to achieve .",
    "however , such a choice for the pc branch results in a sharp feature in the spectrum of the accelerated protons . as can be seen in the lower left panel of figure [ fig12.ps ] , the pc branch , unlike the ec , pc or hec branches , crosses the frequency axis ( @xmath241 ) at a finite frequency @xmath242 .",
    "such waves can resonantly scatter protons with a lorentz factor of @xmath243 or an energy of a few hundreds of mev .",
    "if the spectrum of pc branch wave extends to a very low wavenumber , one would get very efficient acceleration at such energies and a sharp spectral feature .",
    "we assume that such a feature is not present ( although there is no definite observation to rule it out ) and cutoff the spectrum of the pc waves at a higher @xmath244 or a scale of @xmath245 .",
    "_ the high @xmath28 or small scale _ cutoff is determined via the damping of the waves by low energy particles .",
    "for example , the cyclotron waves with high wavenumbers are subject to thermal damping in plasmas with a finite temperature ( schlickeiser & achatz 1993 ; steinacker et al . 1997 ; pryadko & petrosian 1998 ) .",
    "one can introduce an imaginary @xmath27 to include this effect .",
    "the real part of @xmath27 is not very sensitive to the plasma temperature ( miller & steinacker 1992 ) .",
    "so the cold plasma dispersion relation still gives a good description of the resonant interactions between waves and particles .",
    "however , above a wavenumber where the thermal damping time is comparable with the time scale of the wave cascade , the thermal damping steepens the spectrum of the turbulence . in the absence of a full treatment of these processes",
    ", we shall assume that the cyclotron waves have steeper spectra than the whistler and alfvn waves and set @xmath246 for the ec branch .",
    "for the pc and hec branches we set @xmath247 .",
    "these spectral breaks are indicated by the crosses in the lower left panel of figure [ fig12.ps ] .",
    "recent studies of the transport of high energy particles in the solar wind indicate that the resonance broadening due to the dissipation of turbulent plasma waves plays an essential role in explaining the observed long mean free paths of the particles ( bieber et al .",
    "1994 ; drge 2003 ) .",
    "such broadening is also expected in our case .",
    "it will modify only equation ( [ chi ] ) if the broadening width is less than the separation between the resonances . in the opposite ( and unlikely )",
    "case the idea of resonant interaction is invalid . because the resonance broadening mostly affects the scatterings of particles at relatively low energies , where coulomb collisions are important under solar flare conditions , it is less important in understanding the particle acceleration processes studied here",
    ".    all the formulae developed in the previous sections are still valid except that now @xmath248(q-1)k_{\\rm min}^{q-1}\\ , , \\label{taup1}\\ ] ] and the alfvn velocity is given by @xmath249 $ ] . because @xmath234 and @xmath250 ( and the pc branch contains much less energy than the other branches ) the total turbulence energy density @xmath251 .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig12.ps ] gives the electron ( thick curves ) and proton ( thin curves ) acceleration ( solid curves ) and scattering ( dashed curves ) times for a model with @xmath252 .",
    "we see that in the high energy range where particles are mostly interacting with the alfvn waves , the times are almost the same as those in a pure hydrogen plasma . at low energies ,",
    "the times rise sharply with the decrease of energy due to the thermal damping of the waves with high wavenumbers .",
    "as we will see in the following discussion , the thermal damping makes the particle acceleration times match their escape times , giving near power law accelerated particle distributions .",
    "more importantly , in the intermediate energy range , an acceleration barrier in the proton acceleration time still exists even though it is not as prominent as it is in a pure hydrogen plasma .",
    "this is mainly due to interactions with the hec branch which makes the acceleration of low energy protons more efficient .",
    "the sharp decrease of the acceleration time with energy near the critical energy is still due to interaction with the whistler waves . comparing with figure [ fig8.ps ]",
    ", we note that the electron acceleration and scattering times are also affected as evident by the wiggles seen at a few tens of mev .",
    "these wiggles are due to interactions with the hec and pc branches .",
    "we emphasize here that @xmath253 corresponds to the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "our only assumption which may be ad hoc is the large scale size cutoff for the pc branch waves .",
    "this assumption is not driven by observations but primarily introduced to obtain a smooth proton spectrum .",
    "we shall explore consequences of the assumption in the future . in the following discussion",
    ", we will fix these parameters at the specified values and investigate how the particle acceleration processes are affected by the strength of the turbulence @xmath254 , the size of acceleration site @xmath63 , the plasma parameter @xmath4 and the temperature of the injected particles .",
    "we will show that this model gives much more reasonable explanations to solar flare observations than the previous one .",
    "we now present some results on the relative numbers of accelerated electrons and protons at the acceleration site ( lt ) and escaping to the fps . here",
    "we explore its dependence on the model parameters .",
    "the normalization is as before ( see figure [ fig10.ps ] and discussion in eq . [ [ nfp ] ] ) , namely we assume that the escape fluxes for the total numbers of electrons and protons are equal .",
    "figure [ fig13.ps ] gives our fiducial model for solar flares where the energy content in the accelerated electrons and protons in the relevant observational energy bands ( indicated by the shaded regions ) is comparable .",

    "the other model parameters are : the size of the lt source @xmath256 cm , @xmath257 @xmath191 , @xmath258 gauss ( @xmath259 ) and @xmath260 sec . these imply @xmath261 , which is @xmath262 for @xmath263 . compared with models in pure hydrogen plasmas , the turbulence required to accelerate the particles is much weaker in the current model .",
    "this is mainly because of the adopted kolmogorov ( instead of @xmath208 or @xmath264 ) turbulence spectrum at long wavelengths .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=317 ]    in figure [ fig14.ps ] , we show the effects of the strength of turbulence on the particle acceleration .",
    "because the acceleration time is proportional to @xmath265 but the escape time is inverse proportional to it , a small change in @xmath265 can make the acceleration and escape times off balance very quickly .",
    "the spectra of the accelerated particles then change dramatically with @xmath265 .",
    "however , because this is true for both electrons and protons , changes in the energy partition between electrons and protons are much smaller .",
    "another parameter that affects the spectra of the accelerated particles is the size l of the acceleration region .",
    "an increase of @xmath63 results in an increase of the escape time and harder spectra of the accelerated particles .",
    "however , again because the escape times of electrons and protons increase by the same factor , the energy partition between them is not changed significantly .",
    "for example , for a model with @xmath187 cm and @xmath266 s@xmath112 , we find that the accelerated particle spectra which are harder than those in the left panel of figure [ fig14.ps ] and more like those in the right panel of figure [ fig13.ps ] .",
    "next we examine the effects of the plasma parameter @xmath267 .",
    "figure [ fig15.ps ] shows how the relative acceleration of electrons and protons changes with the change in the value of @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that for the range of parameters used in the current study , it does not matter whether @xmath4 is changed by changing the value of the density @xmath36 or the magnetic field @xmath268 .",
    "the difference between these two possibilities will appear as relatively small changes in the spectra at the low and high energy ends where coulomb collisions and synchrotron losses become important , respectively . to make the spectral shapes compatible with solar flare observations ,",
    "the value of @xmath175 also needs adjustment .",
    "but as we showed above , @xmath175 affects primarily the spectral hardness but not the relative acceleration of electrons and protons .",
    "thus the most relevant cause of the changes in the relative acceleration of protons and electrons is the variation of @xmath4 ; proton ( and consequently other ions ) acceleration is more efficient in high density and/or low magnetic field plasmas . given that the acceleration of electrons and protons are dominated by different wave branches , it is not surprising that their relative acceleration depends on the plasma parameter @xmath4 .",

    "_ goes _ and _ rhessi _ observations do suggest such a characteristic energy for the particles before the impulsive phase of x - ray flares .",
    "for example , _ rhessi _ s high resolution spectra indicate that the electrons in the soft x - ray emitting plasma always deviate from an isothermal distribution , implying a significant pre - heating of the flare plasma ( holman et al .",

    "the quasi - thermal part of the spectra ( similar to that of the injected particles ) is more prominent , while at higher t the spectra of the accelerated particles are dominated by the nonthermal tails .",
    "the primary aim of this work is the determination of the relative acceleration of electrons and protons by waves in a stochastic acceleration ( sa ) model . in this paper , we present the results of the investigation of the resonant interaction of the particles with a broad spectrum of waves propagating to the large scale magnetic field .",
    "we calculate the acceleration and transport coefficients and determine the resulting spectra for both particles for physical conditions appropriate for solar flares .",
    "we show that the injection of such a turbulence in a magnetized hot plasma can accelerate both electrons and protons of the thermal background plasma to high energies in the acceleration site .",
    "some of the accelerated particles escape the site and reach the fps .",
    "the parameters that govern these processes are the density , temperature , magnetic field , size of the acceleration region and the intensity and spectrum of the turbulence .",
    "we first describe two general features of our results .",
    "a. the first has to do with the general characteristics of the accelerated particle spectra .",
    "the outcome of the sa of a background thermal plasma is the presence of two distinct components .",
    "the first is a quasi - thermal component at low energies where coulomb collisions play important roles .",
    "this can be considered as a simple heating process of the background plasma .",
    "the second is a nonthermal tail with a somewhat complex spectral shape . technically , one can separate the two components at the energy where the coulomb collisional loss rate @xmath269 is equal to the direct acceleration rate @xmath94 .",
    "we can then calculate the fractions of the turbulence energy that go to `` heat '' and to``acceleration '' .",
    "this explains the observation of both thermal and nonthermal emissions during the impulsive phase of solar flares .",
    "the spectra of particles reaching the fps are in general harder than the corresponding lt particle spectra because high energy particles in the nonthermal tails escape more readily .",
    "the relative size of the two components in the acceleration site ( lt ) vs the fps and for electrons vs protons depends sensitively on the model parameters , which can explain the large variation of the observed nonthermal emission among solar flares and other astrophysical sources .",
    "b. the second feature has to do with the relative acceleration of electrons and protons . _ to our knowledge",
    ", a new result of our investigation is that there is a significant difference in the acceleration of protons and electrons .",
    "_ while the transport and acceleration coefficients for electrons are smooth functions of energy , this is not true for protons .",
    "there appears to be a barrier ( lower rate ) of acceleration for intermediate energy protons .",
    "this can have a dramatic effect on the relative production rate and spectra of the accelerated protons and electrons .    to demonstrate some of this and other more subtle effects , we first investigated the acceleration of electrons and protons in pure hydrogen plasmas by turbulence with a simple power - law spectrum .",
    "we find that this simple model does not agree with some qualitative aspects of the observed accelerated particle distributions in solar flares .",
    "the barrier for protons is too strong for reasonable physical conditions .",
    "we then explore more realistic models , where we include the effects of the background @xmath0he particles and the thermal damping of the waves .",
    "these more realistic models are in better concordance with solar flare observations .",
    "specifically we find the following :    1 .   in general , electrons are preferentially accelerated in more strongly magnetized plasmas ( small @xmath267 ) while the proton acceleration is efficient in more weakly magnetized plasmas .",
    "the ratio of the energy that goes into the accelerated electrons to that into protons is very sensitive to @xmath4 , which can explain the wide range of the observed energy partition between these particles .",
    "the proton acceleration will be more efficient in larger loops where the magnetic field is presumably weaker and during the later phase of flares when the corona loops have been filled by plasmas evaporated from the chromosphere , giving a higher gas density .",
    "this can explain the offset of the centroid of the gamma - ray line emission ( due to accelerated protons and ions ) from that of the hard x - rays indicated by a recent _ rhessi _ observation @xcite .",
    "it can also account for the observed delay of the nuclear line emission relative to the hard x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the acceleration rates and spectra of both electrons and protons are very sensitive to the intensity of the turbulence and the size of the acceleration site .",
    "models with more intense turbulence and/or larger acceleration region give rise to harder spectra .",
    "this result can explain the observed soft x - ray emission in advance of the impulsive phase hard x - ray and gamma - ray emissions ( the so - called pre - heating ) and the slower than expected decline of the temperature of the lt plasma in the gradual phase .",
    "when the turbulence is weak , as will be the case at the beginning and end of a flare , almost all the dissipated turbulence energy goes into the quasi - thermal component and there is no significant hard component , producing soft x - ray emission without obvious hard x - ray or gamma - ray emission .",
    "when the strength of the turbulence exceeds a threshold , nonthermal tails and high energy radiations ensue . on the other hand , for a turbulence energy much above this threshold",
    ", one would expect harder spectra than observed in solar flares .",
    "this may indicate that the sudden presence of a large amount of high energy particles also introduces significant dissipation of the turbulence over a broad frequency range such that the strength of the turbulence is limited to a level close to the threshold .",
    "consequently , we do not see flares with very flat x - ray spectra . to address these processes in detail",
    ", one needs to treat the wave generation , cascade and damping by both low and high energy particles properly . such an investigation",
    "is clearly warranted now but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "3 .   in general the spectra of both electrons and protons at the acceleration site ( lt )",
    "are softer ( stronger quasi - thermal component and steeper nonthermal spectrum ) than the equivalent thick target spectra at the fps .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the results from the _ yohkoh _ @xcite and with the more convincing evidence from _ rhessi _ observations @xcite .",
    "the most important parameter here is the energy dependence of the escape time ( see equation [ [ escall ] ] ) which depends on the pitch angle diffusion coefficient and the size of the acceleration region . unlike the acceleration time",
    "( see item b above ) , the scattering and escape times for protons and electrons have similar general behaviors .",
    "consequently , the difference between the lt and fp spectra is similar for both electrons and protons .",
    "4 .   for injected plasmas with high temperatures ,",
    "most of the particles can be accelerated to very high energies and the steady state particle distribution at low energies can be quite different from a thermal distribution .",
    "the presence of a quasi - thermal component is typical for low temperature plasmas .",
    "there are high energy cutoffs ( at around 1 mev for electrons and 10 mev for protons ) in the accelerated particle spectra .",
    "both cutoffs are due to the quick escape and the relatively inefficient acceleration of higher energy particles .",
    "the location of these cutoffs are directly related to the higher wavenumber spectral breaks in the turbulence spectrum . in plasmas with stronger thermal damping , the acceleration of high energy particles becomes relatively more efficient than that of low energy particles .",
    "consequently , the cutoffs shift toward higher energies .",
    "we would then expect a positive correlation between the cutoff energies and the heating rate of the background plasma .",
    "observations over a broad energy range will be able to test this prediction .",
    "finally , we summarize several improvements that are required for direct comparisons with observations :    1 .",
    "the results presented here show that wave - particle interactions play crucial roles in solar flares , especially during the impulsive phase .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of this problem requires the solution of the coupled kinetic equations for both particles and waves .",
    "previous studies on this aspect focused on the alfvn waves alone and ignored the energy dependent escaping processes ( miller & roberts 1995 ; miller et al .",
    "incorporation of the current investigation will make the models more realistic .",
    "+ waves propagating obliquely with respect to the large scale magnetic field will introduce new features to the wave - particle interaction ( pryadko & petrosian 1999 ) .",
    "earlier studies have shown that the fast - mode waves are very efficient in heating or accelerating super - alfvnic particles via landau damping or transit - time damping ( miller et al .",
    "1996 ; quataert 1998 ; schlickeiser & miller 1998 ) .",
    "these waves are expected to enhance the acceleration of high energy electrons and protons and sub - alfvnic particles may also be accelerated when one adopts the exact dispersion relation for the waves .",
    "results similar to what we present here are expected . moreover ,",
    "if the turbulence is dominated by the lower hybrid waves , electrons will not be scattered efficiently so that the electron distribution is not isotropic ( luo , wei , & feng 2003 ) . the acceleration barrier may not exist if this is also true for protons . a comprehensive study including these waves is needed to address the heating and acceleration processes more completely .",
    "2 .   a time dependent model is needed to address the temporal characteristics of solar flares and the injection processes . here",
    "we assume that the system is in a steady state and the injection fluxes of protons and electrons are equal .",
    "this may be the case if the plasmas are brought into the acceleration site by the reconnecting magnetic fields .",
    "however , e.g. if electrons have a shorter escape time than protons , there could be a net charge flux from the acceleration site , which would induce reverse currents consisting mainly of electrons so that the injection fluxes of electrons and protons into the acceleration site will be different .",
    "the application of the formalism developed here to the acceleration of other ions is straightforward .",
    "we are in the process of evaluating the relative acceleration of different ion species and isotopes and the results are promising and will be published in future papers .",
    "it is also straightforward to apply the formalism to accretion systems of black holes and neutron stars . besides the magnetic reconnection",
    ", turbulent plasma waves can also be produced by the magneto - rotational instability in accretion disks ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",

    "waves in the em branch interact resonantly with protons and those in the em branch interact with electrons only for low values of @xmath4 .",
    "these interactions mostly affect the acceleration of very low energy particles ( see discussion in  [ cri ] ) .",
    "waves in the ec and pc branches are the dominant modes for the acceleration of protons and electrons for intermediate and high values of @xmath4 and energies and therefore play key roles in determining the relative acceleration of the two species . in what follows",
    "we give some approximate analytic descriptions of these modes which are considerably simpler than equation ( [ disp ] ) .    at frequencies",

    "the whistler branch disappears .",
    "one then has @xmath284 for @xmath285 and @xmath286 for @xmath287 for the ec branch ( and the reverse is true for the em branch ) .    similarly for the pc branch one gets the alfvn waves with @xmath288 at low wavenumbers ( @xmath289 ) .",
    "the proton - cyclotron waves whose dispersion relation does nt have a simple form can be roughly approximated as @xmath290 for high @xmath28 .",
    "we can combine these two forms into one simple expression @xmath291 which agrees with the exact expression to within @xmath292 for @xmath282 .",
    "for very highly magnetized plasmas , @xmath293 , one again has @xmath294 for @xmath295 and @xmath296 for @xmath297 for the pc branch ( and the reverse for the em branch ) .",
    "with the approximate analytical expressions ( [ ecapprox ] ) and ( [ pcapprox ] ) for the dispersion relation , one can derive the critical velocity ( [ betacr ] ) and critical angle ( [ mucr2 ] ) for resonant interactions of low energy particles with the ec and pc branches . the critical velocity is for protons with @xmath298 interacting with the ec branch . from the resonance condition ( [ reson ] ) and the dispersion relation ( [ ecapprox ] ) for the ec branch , we have @xmath299 this equation has three roots with two of them being equal and @xmath300 at the critical velocities ( see figure [ fig1.ps ] , and equation [ [ betacr ] ] ) .",
