    "<S> we introduce a one - dimensional ( 1d ) xz model with alternating @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions on even / odd bonds , interpolating between the ising model and the quantum compass model . </S>",
    "<S> we present two ways of its exact solution by : ( @xmath2 ) mapping to the quantum ising models , and ( @xmath3 ) using fermions with spin @xmath4 . in certain cases </S>",
    "<S> the nearest neighbor pseudospin correlations change discontinuously at the quantum phase transition , where one finds highly degenerate ground state of the 1d compass model .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction _ models of magnetism with exotic interactions are motivated by rather complex orbital superexchange in mott insulators . in certain case </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy of @xmath5 orbitals is only partly lifted and the remaining orbital degrees of freedom are frequently described as @xmath4 spins . </S>",
    "<S> they also arise from spin - orbital superexchange , with rich dynamics leading to enhanced quantum fluctuations near quantum phase transitions @xcite , and to entangled spin - orbital ground states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital interactions have much lower symmetry than the su(2 ) of spin interactions and their form depends on the orientation of the bond in real space @xcite , so they may lead to orbital liquid in three dimensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a generic and simplest model of this type is so - called compass model introduced in @xcite when the coupling along a given bond is ising - like , but _ </S>",
    "<S> different _ spin components are active along particular bonds , for instance @xmath6 and @xmath7 along @xmath8 and @xmath9 axis in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) compass model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is quite different from classical ising - like models with periodically distributed frustration @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently we discussed the properties of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) model that interpolates between ising and compass model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the solution based on specific choice of interactions indicated divergences in correlation functions while approaching the transition point . </S>",
    "<S> this suggested first order phase transition but it was not clear if the effect is generic or it is just an artefact of singular parametrization of interactions . to answer this question we introduce more general solution which can be applied to any parametrization and </S>",
    "<S> then we make second insight into the original problem .    </S>",
    "<S> _ xz model in one dimension _ the model is described by a generalized xz hamiltonian with different energies for even and odd bonds , where the number of sites is @xmath10 and for simplicity we suppose that @xmath11 is even @xmath12 this hamiltonian turns into the one discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite if we fix the energy constants as follows : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath18 it gives @xmath19 and for @xmath20 we transform @xmath21 , @xmath22 for all @xmath2 and @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ first solution _ to solve the model given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ha1 ] ) we choose eigenbasis of @xmath24 operators consisting of vectors @xmath25 with @xmath26 for all @xmath2 . every state like that can be denoted equivalently as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this will let us exploit the fact that the hamiltonian ( [ ha1 ] ) flips only odd pairs of spins . for states like ( [ sub ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we define new spin operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 which act only on @xmath33 quantum numbers @xmath34 next we transform each @xmath31 as follows @xmath35 , to get effective forms of the hamiltonian in subspaces spanned by vectors ( [ sub ] ) with fixed @xmath36 s @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> now we have to solve two types of quantum ising model ( qim ) ; either with periodic or antiperiodic boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> the solution is well known and was described in detail in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first step is to introduce jordan - wigner ( jw ) transformation , @xmath40 the boundary condition for fermion operators @xmath41 differs for even and odd number of quasiparticles in the chain . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the hamiltonian conserves the parity of fermions , this lets us write @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and where @xmath44 are projections on subspaces with even ( + ) and odd ( @xmath45 ) number of quasiparticles . here </S>",
    "<S> we adopt notation @xmath46 for the subspace labels @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions are @xmath48 for @xmath49 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> after the fourier transformation , @xmath50 we find ( [ qimjw ] ) in a block diagonal form @xmath51 where quasimomenta @xmath52 take `` integer '' values @xmath53 for a periodic boundary condition and in the antiperiodic case they are `` half - integer '' @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> diagonalization is completed by a bogoliubov transformation @xmath55 preformed for all @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 are eigenmodes of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation @xmath59=e_k\\gamma_k^{\\dagger}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> in this way we get the full hamiltonian s spectrum in every subspace @xmath46 . for instance , in case </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath60 we obtain a hamiltonian for even number of quasiparticles @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the quasiparticle energy . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is bogoliubov vacuum in a subspace where all @xmath64 , apart from points @xmath65 it has no degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> cases of @xmath66 are trivial . for @xmath67 </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath68 for all @xmath46 which means that there is a ground state in every subspace where @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this results in @xmath70-fold degeneracy for the 1d compass model [ fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : com](a ) ] . in the limit </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 the lowest energies of periodic and antiperiodic qim get equal at @xmath67 . for @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> they are already two and threefold degenerate , so when @xmath67 the total degeneracy is @xmath73 , and the spin gap vanishes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> = 4.4 cm    .6 cm = 4.4 cm    _ second solution _ the most direct way of dealing with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ham ] ) is to leave the interactions @xmath74 and @xmath75 undefined and to start with the jw transformation @xmath76 which transforms spins into fermion operators @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> here the crucial step is to introduce new quantum number for fermions with two possible values @xmath78 and @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be regarded as quasiparticles spin or as splitting the chain into bi - atomic elementary cells . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath80 and @xmath81 . because of the boundary conditions and the fact that @xmath82 preserves the parity of fermions , we obtain @xmath83 where @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) is defined in subspace with even ( odd ) number of fermions with @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we introduced new notation for @xmath88 s ; @xmath89 and analogically for @xmath90 s . </S>",
    "<S> now , we proceed with fourier transform @xmath91 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 fermions separately , compatible to fermions parity . for periodic boundary conditions @xmath52 s take `` integer '' values and in the antiperiodic case they are `` half - integer '' . </S>",
    "<S> finally we find the problem block diagonal in a form @xmath92 and for @xmath93 similarly but with @xmath94 possible . </S>",
    "<S> diagonalization is completed by a four - dimensional bogoliubov transformation . </S>",
    "<S> we search for invariant subspace of a linear operator @xmath95 $ ] in 8-dimensional space spanned by @xmath96 and @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> the result suggests the form of transformation as @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are orthogonal matrices . </S>",
    "<S> this assures that @xmath61 s are fermionic . </S>",
    "<S> the rows of @xmath101 are eigenvectors of bogoliubov - de gennes equation @xmath102 = e_{k}\\gamma_{k}^{n\\dagger}$ ] and eigenvalues @xmath103 are energies of sytem s elementary excitations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find @xmath84 in a diagonal form @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 . in a similar way we get the result for @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> luckily , the parity of particles @xmath61 is the same as parity of original jw fermions , thus only states with even ( odd ) number of quasiparticles @xmath61 belong to the spectrum of @xmath107 ( @xmath85 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state energy @xmath108 obtained from ( [ npdiag ] ) is @xmath109 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> putting @xmath110 and @xmath111 we find the same energy spectrum as described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite [ see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : com](a ) ] . for @xmath112 </S>",
    "<S> one finds @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which means that the occupation numbers @xmath115 play the role of the subspace indexes @xmath36 from the previous solution while @xmath116 describe excitations within a given subspace .    </S>",
    "<S> pseudospin correlation functions can be derived from @xmath108 as derivatives with respect to @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is that @xmath117 and @xmath118 remain constant in intervals @xmath119 and @xmath120 $ ] , but with discontinuities at @xmath67 [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : com](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of these singularities is a cusp of @xmath121 surface at @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> the trajectory @xmath123 passes through this point at @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that no first order phase transition occurs in the general model of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ham ] ) , unless curves @xmath123 or @xmath124 pass through @xmath125 . passing should be interpreted literally as passing , not reversing at @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the curve @xmath126 reaches the point @xmath125 at @xmath67 , but nevertheless one of the pseudospin correlations remains continuous .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary _ we have presented an exact solution which demonstrated that a hidden order with constant pseudospin correlations exists in the 1d xz model . the second method used for solving this problem provides more insight into the nature of the quantum phase transition as discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , while the second one is more flexible and may be generalized , for instance , to the ladder geometry . </S>"
