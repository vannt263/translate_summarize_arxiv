    ", @xmath1 has been a subject of investigations @xcite for a , simple but much studied , discrete tight - binding one dimensional random chain which is coupled to a perfect lead at one side . a numerical study @xcite shows that in a broad range of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where the exponent @xmath4 is very close to @xmath5 . intuitively the @xmath6 behaviour can be deduced by assuming a uniform distribution for the localization centers of exponentially localized states @xcite .",
    "however , from analytic point of view one usually considers an infinitely long chain in which case the average density of resonances ( dor ) has a well defined limit . for a finite size system ,",
    "the difference between the dor and @xmath1 is the normalization by the system size @xcite .",
    "recently , kunz and shapiro have derived analytic expression of the dor for a semi - infinite disordered chain @xcite .",
    "they have obtained an exact integral representation of the dor which is valid for arbitrary lead - chain coupling strength .",
    "this has been further simplified for small lead - chain coupling strength where a universal scaling formula is found . in this limit",
    "they have proved the @xmath6-behavior of the dor @xcite . besides , for the continuous limit of this model an integral representation of dor has been obtained @xcite .    kunz and shapiro s work",
    "has established a universal @xmath6 law for arbitrary strength of disorder in a semi - infinite chain .",
    "numerically one can verify @xmath6 law of the dor , similar to what has been done by terraneo and guarnery @xcite in finite samples for @xmath1 .",
    "such verifications require the localization lengths to be much smaller than the size of the sample . in case of weak disorder",
    "an analytic result for the localization lengths is particularly useful .",
    "it comes from a second order perturbation theory .",
    "it states that the localization length is maximum near the middle of the energy band and is proportional to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the width of the disorder @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", this result also leads to an interesting limiting situation where the localization lengths are much longer than the sample size .",
    "this is what we refer to as a weak disorder limit in this paper .",
    "this limit has scarcely been studied hitherto although it is relevant in the study of localization through resonances .",

    "we address to this limit and derive analytic results which describe the statistics of resonances .",
    "our work probes a fresh area and studies a weak disorder limit which has never been addressed before .    for open systems , instead of studying the scattering matrix in a complex plane we follow an alternative approach where one solves the schrdinger equation by describing a particle ejected from the system or equivalently with a boundary condition of outgoing waves ( siegert boundary condition @xcite ) . in this approach",
    "one naturally turns up to a problem of solving a non - hermitian effective hamiltonian which admits complex eigenvalues @xmath9 @xcite . for details of such non - hermitian effective hamiltonians",
    ", we refer to a recent study @xcite and references therein .",
    "we derive the statistics which describe scattered complex energies of disordered chain around those regular ones which correspond to an open chain without any disorder ( clean chain ) .",
    "for instance , we derive average of square of the absolute values of the shifts in complex energies from the regular ones over all realizations of the set of random site energies .",
    "similarly we obtain results for the statistics of real and imaginary parts of those shifts .",
    "these results lead to compact expressions for long chains . to show the generality of our approach we also derive these results for the so - called parametric resonances which have been particularly useful in numerical studies @xcite .",
    "finally , we give numerical verifications of our analytic results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "we have used a perturbation theory up to the second order where we have derived the first and the second order corrections to the complex energies in terms of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "the first order corrections have been useful to obtain closed form of the statistical results for the scattered complex energies .",
    "these results have been further simplified for long chains where we obtain compact results .",
    "the asymptotic results have been verified against numerics .",
    "evidently , in the weak disorder limit the perturbation theory predicts nice statistical results .",
    "our results are new in these studies and they could be useful in the further studies of such systems",
    ".    it would be interesting to study statistics of resonances in the weak disorder limit for higher dimensional models as well as for the cases when the site energies are not independent random variables but they are correlated with each other @xcite . besides , there has been growing interest for the case when @xmath217 sites are connected to the outer world where @xmath218 @xcite .",
