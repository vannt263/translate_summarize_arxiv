    "in the last five years , there has been an intense activity in order to export the ideas of the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite to non - relativistic physics .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that some models that describe this kind of phenomena enjoy the non - relativistic version of the conformal symmetries : the so - called schrdinger group @xcite . in the spirit of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , the gravity dual metric has been identified as the spacetime whose isometry group coincides with the schrdinger group , see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . of particular importance is also the construction of kachru _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which proposed a new gravitational background dual to scale invariant lifshitz fixed points without galilean boost invariance . in this case",
    "the gravity backgrounds are commonly called lifshitz spacetimes , and its simplest realization occurs in three dimensions as follows : @xmath4 these spacetimes admit as their main feature an anisotropic scaling symmetry @xmath5 with dynamical critical exponent @xmath6 ( the isotropic case @xmath0 corresponds to ads ) as part of their isometry group .",
    "black hole solutions whose asymptotic behaviors reproduce the lifshitz metric are of particular importance for a finite - temperature holographic description of non - relativistic systems and are commonly known as lifshitz black holes .",
    "however , in contrast with the ads case , lifshitz spacetimes are not solutions of general relativity and require the introduction of matter sources or to consider square - curvature corrections to standard gravity @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of these theories is the so - called new massive gravity ( nmg ) @xcite in three dimensions , which has been intensively studied in the last five years .",
    "this theory presents the advantage of being at the linearized level equivalent to the unitary fierz - pauli theory for free massive spin-2 gravitons . up to now",
    ", there are only two known static black hole solutions of this theory both characterized asymptotically by a specific dynamical exponent @xmath3 .",
    "the first one occurs for @xmath0 and it is nothing but an asymptotically ads black hole solution derived in @xcite while the second one corresponds to a proper lifshitz black hole solution with a dynamical exponent @xmath1 and found in @xcite .",
    "these black holes have lifshitz soliton counterparts obtained in @xcite , @xcite by operating a double wick rotation in the killing @xmath7-plane which are characterized by dynamical exponents @xmath0 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this is due to the fact that the two - dimensional lifshitz algebras with dynamical exponents @xmath3 and @xmath8 are isomorphic .    unlike in general relativity @xcite , it is extremely difficult to establish uniqueness results in higher - order gravity theories , which are by default plagued of instabilities .",
    "the unitarity of nmg opens a window of opportunity , however , since there exist at least two different static black hole solutions , such uniqueness theorem can not be established .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand what is the spectrum of black hole configurations admitted by this theory . a reasonable starting point is the fact that most of the black hole solutions that we know can be expressed as a kerr - schild transformation from the spacetime to which they approach asymptotically .",
    "it is well - known that the original kerr - schild ansatz @xcite , as well as its generalizations , is a powerful tool for searching stationary black hole solutions of einstein equations both in vacuum and in presence of matter sources , see e.g.  @xcite and more recently @xcite for higher dimensions . just for completeness",
    ", we also mention the existence of examples for which the kerr - schild ansatz may be efficient even with a seed metric that does not solve the field equations , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the kerr - schild ansatz usually lies in the fact that it linearizes a certain combination of curvature components and since standard gravity is linear in curvature , the kerr - schild ansatz consequently linearizes einstein equations .",
    "this is no longer the case for higher - curvature theories .",
    "however , part of the dynamics is still linearized for theories with squared - curvature corrections as nmg .",
    "this property will be useful in order to achieve the main purpose of this work : to understand what are the asymptotically lifshitz static , axisymmetric black holes admitted by nmg that can be written as a kerr - schild transformation from the lifshitz spacetime ( [ eq : lifshitz ] ) .",
    "in fact , we will show that the dynamics of nmg restricts those configurations via two constraints : a linear one , due to the kerr - schild ansatz , and a non - linear one capturing the natural higher - curvature character of the theory .",
    "after a thorough analysis , we conclude that the struggle between both behaviors is only consistently balanced for the values @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the critical exponent , yielding to the previously mentioned black hole solutions . in other words ,",
    "the solution space is a constrained system within a linear space and many of the linear directions end up being inconsistent with the nonlinear constraint .",
    "additionally , these precise exponents play a special role since they are the only ones for which the characteristic polynomial determining the linear directions presents multiplicities , i.e.  they are the boundaries between different behaviors of the linear spaces .",
    "even if this is only a partial uniqueness statement , it is actually one of the very few uniqueness results found in high - order gravity theories .",
    "a similar analysis is carried out for the lifshitz soliton solutions of nmg , which can not be cast in kerr - schild form but likewise allow a representation in terms of a metric ansatz involving a single function .",
    "remarkably , the soliton field equations can be mapped to the black hole ones .",
    "this allows us to find that the only soliton solutions within this class are those obtained from the now unique black hole solutions operating a double wick rotation , and yielding to the lifshitz solitons with dynamical exponents @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "let us now present the different ingredients in order for the paper to be self - consistent .",
    "the action of new massive gravity is given by @xmath9=\\frac{1}{2\\kappa}\\int{d^3x}\\sqrt{-g } \\left ( r - 2\\lambda - \\frac{1}{m^2}k \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand respectively for the ricci scalar , the ricci tensor and the cosmological constant , while the unitary correction is defined as @xmath13 .",
    "the associated field equations read    [ eq : nmg ] @xmath14 where the higher - order contribution @xmath15    has second order trace @xmath16 .    as was originally shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the field equations of nmg ( [ eq : nmg ] ) allow lifshitz spacetimes ( [ eq : lifshitz ] ) as solutions for a generic value of the dynamical exponent @xmath3 , by means of the following suitable parameterizations of the cosmological constant and the mass    [ eq : ccz<>1 ] @xmath17    where the values of @xmath3 giving a vanishing value of the mass are forbidden .",
    "these parameterizations are valid in general except for the ads case @xmath0 , for which only the following constraint is satisfied @xmath18 the different static black hole and soliton solutions will be presented at the beginning of each section before proving their uniqueness in the following subsections .",
    "conclusions and comments on possible applications to other contexts of the arguments introduced in this work are provided at the end .",
    "the first static black hole solution found for nmg was the @xmath0 ads black hole , independently obtained by bergshoeff _",
    "_ @xcite and oliva _ et al .",
    "the line element is given by    [ eq : z=1bh ] @xmath19 and the solution occurs for @xmath20    the extra constant @xmath21 represents a gravitational `` hair '' encoding the higher - order contribution .",
    "note that for @xmath22 , the solution becomes the baados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) black hole @xcite which in general obeys the weaker constraint ( [ eq : lambda2mz=1 ] ) .",
    "the other static black hole solution known for nmg is the @xmath1 lifshitz black hole found in @xcite , and its line element reads    [ eq : z=3bh ] @xmath23 with coupling constants given by @xmath24    in both cases the identification @xmath25 is understood .",
    "as will be appreciated below , both black holes allow a kerr - schild representation . in its most general form",
    ", a kerr - schild transformation permits the construction of a spacetime that asymptotes a starting one using a scalar function and a null geodesic vector field of the original metric . in our problem ,",
    "the relevant kerr - schild ansatz for a stationary axisymmetric spacetime is the following @xmath26 where @xmath27 corresponds to the asymptotic spacetime , namely the lifshitz metric ( [ eq : lifshitz ] ) . it is straightforward to show that the two more general families of null geodesics compatible with the translation symmetries of the lifshitz spacetime ( [ eq : lifshitz ] ) , i.e.  being stationary and axisymmetric are given by @xmath28 however , if we were to preserve the contribution along the @xmath29 direction , we would lose the asymptotically lifshitz behavior in the kerr - schild transformation ( [ eq : ks ] ) , except for @xmath0 .",

    "the strategy we follow was simple and it consists on first characterizing the linear space of solutions of the euler equation for each dynamical exponent and then exploring the compatibility of this linear space with the nonlinear constraint .",
    "furthermore , we have been able to map these black hole constraints to their corresponding solitonic ones and proved in this way that the soliton counterparts with dynamical exponents @xmath0 and @xmath2 are the only lifshitz solitons that can exist in nmg within certain ansatz depending on a single function .",
    "we have put in light a relation between the existence of black hole solutions with the multiplicity of the roots of the characteristic polynomial associated to the euler equation .",
    "this feature appears as well in the case of solitons where multiplicity arises for @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "this partially answers what is special about this exponents in nmg .",
    "an interesting work will then consist in giving a more deep physical and/or mathematical explanation for this curiosity . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have found the analogous solutions of those of new massive gravity for general quadratic corrections of the einstein gravity in arbitrary dimension .",
    "we believe that the arguments established here can be generalized to the case of these higher - dimensional lifshitz black hole solutions .",
    "there also exist examples for which the kerr - schild transformation allows to obtain interesting solutions in presence of matter sources as for example in the context of eleven - dimensional supergravity with the @xmath119form @xcite .",
    "hence , it will be interesting to explore whether the mechanism presented here can also be useful to obtain lifshitz black hole solutions in presence of matter source as for example those derived recently in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite or in presence of scalar fields @xcite .",
