    "cross - correlations often provide us very useful information about financial markets to figure out various non - trivial and complicated structures behind the stocks as multivariate time series @xcite .",
    "actually , the use of the cross - correlation can visualize collective behavior of stocks during the crisis .",
    "as such examples , we visualized the collective movement of the stocks by means of the so - called multi - dimensional scaling ( mds ) during the earthquake in japan on march 2011 @xcite .",
    "we have also constructed a prediction procedure for several stocks simultaneously by means of multi - layer ising model having mutual correlations through the mean - fields in each layer @xcite .",
    "usually , we need information about the trend of each stock to predict the price for , you might say , ` single trading ' @xcite . however , it sometimes requires us a lot of unlearnable ` craftsperson s techniques ' to make a profit .",
    "hence , it is reasonable for us to use the procedure without any trend - forecasting - type way in order to manage the asset with a small risk .",
    "from the view point of time - series prediction , elliot _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite made a model for the spread and tried to estimate the state variables ( spread ) as hidden variables from observations by means of kalman filter .",
    "they also estimated the hyper - parameters appearing in the model by using em algorithm ( expectation and maximization algorithm ) which has been used in the field of computer science .",
    "as an example of constructing optimal pairs , mudchanatongsuk @xcite regarded pair prices as ornstein - uhlenbeck process , and they proposed a portfolio optimization for the pair by means of stochastic control .    for the managing of assets , the so - called _ pairs trading _",
    "@xcite has attracted trader s attention .",
    "the pairs trading is based on the assumption that the spread between highly - correlated two stocks might shrink eventually even if the two prices of the stocks temporally exhibit ` mis - pricing ' leading up to a large spread .",
    "it has been believed that the pairs trading is almost ` risk - free ' procedure , however , there are only a few extensive studies @xcite so far to examine the conjecture in terms of big - data scientific approach .    of course , several purely theoretical approaches based on probabilistic theory have been reported .",
    "for instance , the so - called _ arbitrage pricing theory ( apt ) _",
    "@xcite in the research field of econometrics has suggested that the pairs trading works effectively if the linear combination of two stocks , each of which is non - stationary time series , becomes stationary .",
    "namely , the pair of two stocks showing the properties of the so - called _ co - integration _",
    "@xcite might be a suitable pair .",
    "however , it might cost us a large computational time to check the stationarity of the co - integration for all possible pairs in a market , whereas it might be quite relevant issue to clarify whether the pairs trading is actually safer than the conventional ` single trading ' ( see for instance @xcite ) to manage the asset , or to what extent the return from the pairs trading would be expected _",
    "etc_.    with these central issues in mind , here we construct a platform to carry out and to investigate the pairs trading which has been recognized an effective procedure for some kind of ` risk - hedge ' in asset management .",
    "we propose an effective algorithm ( procedure ) to check the amount of profit from the pair trading easily and automatically .",
    "we apply our algorithm to daily data of stocks in the first section of the tokyo stock exchange , which is now available at the yahoo!finance web site @xcite . in the algorithm , three distinct conditions , namely , starting ( @xmath2 ) , profit - taking ( @xmath3 ) and stop - loss ( @xmath4 ) conditions of transaction are automatically built - into the system by evaluating the spread ( gap ) between the prices of two stocks for a given pair .",
    "namely , we shall introduce three essential conditions to inform us when we should start the trading , when the spread between the stock prices satisfies the profit - taking conditions , _",
    "etc_. by making use of a very simple way .",
    "numerical evaluations of the algorithm for the empirical data set are carried out for all possible pairs by changing the starting , profit - taking and stop - loss conditions in order to look for the best possible combination of the conditions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section [ sec : sec2 ] ,",
    "we introduce several descriptions for the mathematical modeling of pairs trading and set - up for the empirical data analysis by defining various variables and quantities . here",
    "we also mention that the pairs trading is described by a first - passage process @xcite , and explain the difference between our study and arbitrage pricing theory ( apt ) @xcite which have highly developed in the research field of econometrics . in section",
    "[ sec : sec3 ] , we introduce several rules of the game for the trading .",
    "we define two relevant measurements to quantify the usefulness of pairs trading , namely , winning probability and profit rate .",
    "the concrete algorithm to carry out pairs trading automatically is also given in this section explicitly .",
    "the results of empirical data analysis are reported and argued in section [ sec : sec4 ] .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary .",
    "in pairs trading , we first pick up two stocks having a large correlation in the past .",
    "a well - known historical example is the pair of _ coca cola _ and _ pepsi cola _",
    "then , we start the action when the spread ( gap ) between the two stocks prices increases up to some amount of the level ( say , @xmath2 ) , namely , we sell one increasing stock ( say , the stock @xmath5 ) and buy another decreasing one ( say , the stock @xmath6 ) at the time @xmath7 . we might obtain the arbitrage as a profit ( gain ) @xmath8 : @xmath9 when the spread decreases to some amount of the level ( say , @xmath10 ) again due to the strong correlation between the stocks , and we buy the stock @xmath5 and sell the stock @xmath6 at time @xmath11 . we should keep in mind that we used here the stock price normalized by the value itself at @xmath12-times before ( we may say ` rate ' ) as @xmath13 where we defined @xmath14 as a price of the stock @xmath5 at time @xmath15 .",
    "it is convenient for us to use the @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) instead of the price @xmath14 because we should treat the pairs changing in quite different ranges of price .",
    "hence , we evaluate the spread between two stocks by means of the rate @xmath16 which denotes how much percentage of the price increases ( or decreases ) from the value itself at @xmath12-times before . in our simulation",
    ", we choose @xmath18}$ ] . by using this treatment ( [ eq : def_gamma ] )",
    ", one can use unified thresholds @xmath19 which are independent of the range of prices for all possible pairs .",
    "obviously , more relevant quantities are now not the prices themselves but the spreads for the prices of pairs",
    ". it might be helpful for us to notice that the process of the spread defined by @xmath20 also produces a time series @xmath21 , which is described as a stochastic process .    in financial markets , the spread ( in particular , the bid - ask spread )",
    "is one of the key quantities for double - auction systems ( for instance , see @xcite ) and the spread between two stocks also plays an important role in pairs trading .",
    "especially , it should be regarded as a _ first - passage process _ ( or sometimes referred to as _ first - exit process _ ) ( see for instance @xcite for recent several applications to finance ) with absorbing boundaries @xmath19 , and the times @xmath7 and @xmath11 are regarded as first - passage times . actually , @xmath7 and @xmath11 are the times @xmath15 satisfying the following for the first time @xmath22 respectively . more explicitly , these times are given by @xmath23 the above argument was given for somewhat an ideal case , and of course , we might lose the money just as much as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a ` termination time ' satisfying @xmath26 this means that we should decide a ` loss - cutting ' when the spread @xmath27 does not shrink to the level @xmath3 and increases beyond the threshold @xmath4 at time @xmath28 .",
    "it should bear in mind that once we start the trading , we get a gain or lose , hence the above @xmath11 and @xmath29 are unified as ` time for decision ' @xmath30 by @xmath31 where we defined a unit step function as @xmath32 namely , if a stochastic process @xmath33 firstly reaches the threshold @xmath3 , the time for decision is @xmath34 , whereas if the @xmath33 goes beyond the threshold @xmath4 before shrinking to the level @xmath3 , we have @xmath35 .",
    "we already mentioned that the pairs trading is based on the assumption that the spread between highly - correlated two stocks might shrink shortly even if the two prices of the stocks exhibit a temporal spread .",
    "taking into account the assumption , here we select the suitable pairs of stocks using the information about correlation coefficient ( the pearson estimator ) for pairs in order to quantify the correlation : @xmath36 and standard deviation ( volatility ) : @xmath37 it should be noted that we also use the definition of the logarithmic return of the rescaled price @xmath38 ( see equation ( [ eq : def_gamma ] ) ) for the duration @xmath39 in ( [ eq : pearson ] ) by @xmath40 and moving average of the observable @xmath41 over the duration @xmath12 as @xmath42 at first glance , the definition of ( [ eq : pearson ] ) for correlation coefficient might look like unusual because ( [ eq : def_delta_gamma ] ) accompanying with ( [ eq : def_gamma ] ) implies that the correlation coefficient consists of the second derivative of prices . however , as we already mentioned , the ` duration ' @xmath43}$ ] appearing in ( [ eq : def_gamma ] ) is quite longer than @xmath44}$ ] , namely , @xmath45 is satisfied .",
    "hence , the price difference in ( [ eq : def_gamma ] ) could not regarded as the same derivative as in the derivative definition of ( [ eq : def_delta_gamma ] ) .",
    "therefore , the definition of correlation coefficient ( [ eq : pearson ] ) is nothing but the conventional first derivative quantity .    from the view point of these quantities @xmath46 ,",
    "the possible pairs should be highly correlated and the standard deviation of each stock should take the value lying in some finite range .",
    "namely , we impose the following condition for the candidates of the pairs at time @xmath7 , that is , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the total number of pairs for us to carry out the pair trading ( from now on , we call such pairs as ` active pairs ' ) is given explicitly as @xmath49 where a factor @xmath50 means that we terminate the game if ` time of decision ' @xmath30 ( see equation ( [ eq : decision_t ] ) ) becomes longer than the whole playing time @xmath51}$ ] .",
    "therefore , the number of active pairs is dependent on the thresholds @xmath52 , and we see the details of the dependence in table [ tab : tb1 ] and table [ tab : tb2 ] under the condition @xmath53 ( see @xmath54 in the tables ) .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : cor ] , we are also confirmed that the number pairs @xmath55 satisfying @xmath47 and @xmath48 is extremely smaller ( @xmath56 ) than the number of combinations for all possible @xmath57 stocks , namely , @xmath58 .",
    "it might be helpful for us to notice that the pairs trading could be regarded as a ` minimal portfolio ' and it can obtain the profit even for the case that the stock average decreases . actually , it is possible for us to construct such ` market neutral portfolio ' @xcite as follows .",
    "let us consider the return of the two stocks @xmath5 and @xmath6 which are described as @xmath59 where parameters @xmath60 denote the so - called ` market betas ' for the stocks @xmath61 , and @xmath62 stands for the return of the stock average , namely , @xmath63 and here we select them ( @xmath60 ) as positive values for simplicity .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath64 appearing in ( [ eq : betai])([eq : betaj ] ) are residual parts ( without any correlation with the stock average ) of the returns of stocks @xmath61",
    ". then , let us assume that we take a short position ( ` selling ' in future ) of the stock @xmath6 by volume @xmath65 and a long position ( ` buying ' in future ) of the stock @xmath5 .",
    "for this action , we have the return of the portfolio as @xmath66 hence , obviously , the choice of the volume @xmath65 as @xmath67 leads to @xmath68 which is independent of the market ( the average stock @xmath62 ) .",
    "we should notice that @xmath69 is rewritten in terms of the profit as follows .",
    "@xmath70 therefore , in this sense , the profit @xmath71 is also independent of the market @xmath62 .",
    "this empirical fact might tell us the usefulness of paris trading .    in the arbitrage pricing theory ( apt ) @xcite ,",
    "the condition for searching suitable pairs is the linear combination of ` non - stationary ' time series @xmath16 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 becomes co - integration , namely , it becomes ` stationary ' .",
    "then , the quantity possesses the long - time equilibrium value @xmath74 and we write @xmath75 with a small deviation @xmath76 from the mean @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , we easily find @xmath77 namely , we obtain the profit with a very small risk .",
    "hence , the numerical checking for the stationarity of the linear combination @xmath73 by means of , for instance , exponentially fast decay of the auto - correlation function or various types of statistical test might be useful for us to select the possible pairs .",
    "however , it computationally cost us heavily for large - scale empirical data analysis .",
    "this is a reason why here we use the correlation coefficients and volatilities to investigate the active pairs instead of the co - integration based analysis as given in the references @xcite .",
    "in this section , we explain rules of our game ( trading ) using the data set for the past three years 2010 - 2012 including 2009 to evaluate the quantities like correlation coefficient and volatility in 2010 by choosing @xmath78 [ days ] . in following ,",
    "we explain how one evaluates the performance of pairs trading according to the rules .",
    "obviously , the ability of the asset management by pairs treading is dependent on the choice of the thresholds @xmath19 .",
    "hence , we should investigate how much percentage of total active pairs can obtain a profit for a given set of @xmath19 . to carry out the empirical analysis , we define the ratio between the profit @xmath79 and the loss @xmath80 for the marginal spread , namely , @xmath81 as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a control parameter . it should be noted that for positive constants @xmath84 the gap of the spreads ( profit ) @xmath85 is written as @xmath86",
    "therefore , the difference @xmath87 appearing in the denominator of equation ( [ eq : def_alpha ] ) gives a lower bound of the profit .",
    "although the numerator @xmath88 in ( [ eq : def_alpha ] ) has no such an explicit meaning , however , implicitly it might be regarded as a ` typical loss ' because the actually realized loss @xmath89 fluctuates around the typical value and it is more likely to take a value which is close to @xmath88 .",
    "hence , for @xmath90 , the loss for the marginal spread @xmath88 is larger than the lowest possible profit once a transaction is taken place and vice versa for @xmath91 .",
    "if we set @xmath91 , it is more more likely to lose the money less than the lowest bound of the profit @xmath87 , however , at the same time , it means that we easily lose due to the small gap between @xmath4 and @xmath2 . in other words",
    ", we might frequently lose with a small amount of losses . on the other hand ,",
    "if we set @xmath90 , we might hardly lose , however , once we lose , the total amount of the losses is quite large .",
    "basically , it lies with traders to decide which to choose @xmath90 or @xmath91 , however , here we set the marginal @xmath92 as a ` neutral strategy ' , that is @xmath93 thus , we have now only two thresholds @xmath94 for our pairs trading , and the @xmath4 should be determined as a ` slave variable ' from equation ( [ eq : balance2 ] ) .",
    "actually this constraint ( [ eq : balance2 ] ) can reduce our computational time to a numerically tractable revel . under the condition ( [ eq : balance2 ] ) , we sweep the thresholds @xmath95 as @xmath96 , @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) and @xmath99 , @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) in our numerical calculations ( see table [ tab : tb1 ] and table [ tab : tb2 ] ) .      in order to investigate the performance of pairs trading quantitatively , we should observe several relevant performance measurements . as such observables , here",
    "we define the following wining probability as a function of the thresholds : @xmath102 where we defined @xmath103 where @xmath104 are numbers of wins and loses , respectively , and the conservation of the number of total active pairs @xmath105 should hold ( see the definition of @xmath106 in ( [ eq : def_n ] ) under the condition @xmath53 ) .",
    "the bracket @xmath107 appearing in ( [ eq : pw ] ) is defined by @xmath108 we also define the profit rate : @xmath109 which is a slightly different measurement from the winning probability @xmath110 .",
    "we should notice that we now consider the case with the constraint ( [ eq : balance2 ] ) and in this sense , the explicit dependences of @xmath110 and @xmath111 on @xmath4 are omitted in the above descriptions .",
    "we also keep in mind that @xmath112 takes a positive value if we make up accounts for taking the arbitrage at @xmath34 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath112 becomes negative if we terminate the trading due to loss - cutting .",
    "therefore , the above @xmath111 denotes a total profit for a given set of the thresholds @xmath113 .",
    "we shall list the concrete algorithm for our empirical study on the pairs trading as follows .    1 .",
    "we collect a pair of stocks @xmath114 from daily data for the past one year . 2 .",
    "do the following procedures from @xmath115 to + @xmath116 .",
    "1 .   calculate @xmath117 and @xmath118 to determine whether the pair @xmath114 satisfy the start condition . +",
    "* start condition : * * if @xmath119 and @xmath120 and @xmath121 , go to ( c ) .",
    "* if not , go to ( b ) .",
    "2 .   @xmath122 and back to ( a ) .",
    "@xmath122 and go to the termination condition . +",
    "* termination condition : * * if @xmath123 ( we ` win ' ) , go to the next pairs @xmath124 . *",
    "if not , go back to ( c ) . if @xmath125 , we ` lose ' . if @xmath126 , go to 1",
    "then , we repeat the above procedure for all possible pairs of @xmath0 stocks listed on the first section of the tokyo stock exchange leading up to totally @xmath127 pairs .",
    "we play our game according to the above algorithm for each pair , and if a pair @xmath114 passes their decision time @xmath30 resulting in the profit : @xmath128 or the loss : @xmath129 we discard the pair @xmath114 and never ` recycle ' the pair again for pairs trading . of course , such treatment might be hardly accepted in realistic pairs trading because traders tend to use the same pairs as the one which gave them a profit in the past markets .",
    "nevertheless , here we shall utilize this somewhat ` artificial ' treatment in order to quantify the performance of paris trading through the measurements @xmath110 and @xmath111 systematically .",
    "we also simplify the game by restricting ourselves to the case in which each trader always makes a trade by a unit volume .",
    "in the next section , we show several result of empirical data analysis .",
    "here we show several empirical data analyses done for all possible pairs of @xmath0 stocks listed on the first section of the tokyo stock exchange leading up to @xmath127 pairs .",
    "the daily data sets are collected for the past four years 2009 - 2010 from the web cite @xcite . in our empirical analysis , we set @xmath78 [ days ] , @xmath130 .      before we show our main result , we provide the two empirical distributions for the correlation coefficients and volatilities , which might posses very useful information about selecting the active pairs .",

    "the former is a low - risk group , whereas the latter is a high - risk group . the density of the points for the low - risk group in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg_scat ] is much higher than that of the high - risk group .",
    "hence , we are confirmed that our selection procedure of the active pairs works effectively to manage the asset as safely as possible by reducing the risk which usually increases as the volatility grows .",
    "finally , it should be noted that as we discussed in subsection [ sec : sub_constraint ] , the value @xmath164 is a lower bound of the profit rate ( see equations ( [ eq : lower_bound ] ) and ( [ eq : eta02 ] ) ) .",

    "of course , we can not list all of the winner pairs in this paper , hence , we here list only three pairs as examples , each of which includes _ sanyo special steel co. ltd . _",
    "( i d : 5481 ) and the corresponding partners are _",
    "hitachi metals . ltd . _",

    "( i d : 5706 ) and _ pacific metals co. ltd . _",
    "( i d : 5541 ) .",
    "namely , the following three pairs @xmath168 actually won in our empirical analysis of the game . note that each i d in the above expression corresponds to each identifier used in yahoo!finance @xcite . as we expected as an example of _ coca cola _ and _ pepsi cola _",
    "@xcite , these are all the same type of industry ( the steel industry ) .",
    "we would like to stress that we should act with caution to trade using the above pairs because the pairs just won the game in which the pairs once got a profit in the past are never recycled in future .",
    "therefore , we need much more extensive analysis for the above pairs to use them in practice .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a very simple and effective algorithm to make the pairs trading easily and automatically .",
    "we applied our algorithm to daily data of stocks in the first section of the tokyo stock exchange .",
    "numerical evaluations of the algorithm for the empirical data set were carried out for all possible pairs by changing the starting ( @xmath2 ) , profit - taking ( @xmath3 ) and stop - loss ( @xmath4 ) conditions in order to look for the best possible combination of the conditions @xmath169 .",
    "we found that for almost all of the combinations @xmath113 under the constraint @xmath170 , one can obtain the positive profit rate @xmath147 , which means that our algorithm actually achieves almost risk - free asset management at least for the past three years ( 2010 - 2012 ) and it might be a justification of the usefulness of pairs trading .",
    "finally , we showed several examples of active pairs to win the game . as we expected before , the pairs are all the same type of industry ( for these examples",
    ", it is the steel industry ) .",
    "we should conclude that the fact @xmath154 in most cases of thresholds @xmath113 implies that automatic pairs trading system could be constructed by applying our algorithm for all possible @xmath113 in parallel way .",
