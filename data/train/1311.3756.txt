    "for a real analytic manifold @xmath0 , one could consider two invariants that encode the local / global analytic and topological structure of @xmath0 , one is the derived category @xmath5 of constructible sheaves on @xmath0 , and the other is the fukaya category @xmath2 of its cotangent bundle @xmath3 .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath5 is generated by locally constant sheaves supported on submanifolds of @xmath0 , which we will call ( co)standard sheaves .",
    "the morphism spaces between these sheaves are naturally identified with relative singular cohomology of certain subsets of @xmath0 taking values in local systems . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath2 is a realm of studying exact lagrangian submanifolds of @xmath3 and the intersection theory of them .",
    "here we use the infinitesimal fukaya category from @xcite , where lagrangian branes are allowed to be noncompact and should have controlled behavior near infinity .    in @xcite , nadler and zaslow established a canonical quasi - embedding @xmath7 induced from @xmath8 , which is called the microlocal functor , between the @xmath9-version of these two categories .",
    "later on , nadler @xcite proved that @xmath8 is actually a quasi - equivalence of categories , hence @xmath10 is an equivalence .",
    "the key ingredient in the construction of @xmath8 is to associate each standard or costandard sheaf a lagrangian brane in @xmath3 which lives over the submanifold and asymptotically approaches the singular support of the sheaf near infinity , so that the floer cohomologies for these branes match with the morphisms on the sheaf side .",
    "one could view this as a way of quantizing the singular support of a sheaf by a lagrangian brane .    in the complex setting ,",
    "when @xmath0 is a complex manifold , one could also study @xmath11-modules on @xmath0 .",
    "the riemann - hilbert correspondence equates the derived category of regular holonomic @xmath11-modules @xmath12 with @xmath1 .",
    "there are also physical interpretions of the relation of branes ( including coisotropic branes ) with @xmath11-modules , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these relations together with @xmath8 connect different approaches to quantizing conical lagrangians in @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the special role of holomorphic lagrangian branes in @xmath2 in the complex setting , via the nadler - zaslow correspondence . for the notion of holomorphic ,",
    "we have used the complex structure on @xmath3 induced from that on @xmath0 .",
    "recall there is an abelian category sitting inside @xmath1 , the category of perverse sheaves , which is the image of the standard abelian category ( single @xmath11-modules ) in @xmath12 under the riemann - hilbert correspondence .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ main ] let @xmath0 be a compact complex manifold and @xmath13 denote the inverse functor of @xmath10 .",
    "then for any holomorphic lagrangian brane @xmath14 in @xmath3 , @xmath15 is a perverse sheaf in @xmath5 up to a shift .",
    "equivalently , @xmath14 gives rise to a single holonomic @xmath11-module on @xmath0 .    in the remainder of the introduction ,",
    "we discuss the motivation and the proof of our result from two aspects : the symplectic geometry and the microlocal geometry . in the symplectic geometry part",
    ", we will summarize the floer cohomology calculations we have for certain classes of lagrangian branes . then in the microlocal geometric side , we will introduce the microlocal approach to perverse sheaves and explain why the floer calculations imply our main theorem .",
    "all of the functors below are derived and we will always omit the derived notation @xmath16 or @xmath14 unless otherwise specified .",
    "we calculate the floer complex for two pairs of lagrangian branes in the cotangent bundle @xmath3 of a complex manifold @xmath0 .",
    "it involves three kinds of lagrangians which we briefly describe .",
    "firstly , we have a ( exact ) holomorphic lagrangian brane @xmath14 with grading @xmath17 ( see lemma [ grading ] ) .",
    "one could dilate @xmath14 using the @xmath18-action on the cotangent fibers and take limit to get a conical lagrangian @xmath19 then for each smooth point @xmath20 , we define a lagrangian brane , which we will call a _ local morse brane _ , depending on the following data .",
    "we choose a generic holomorphic function @xmath21 near @xmath22 which vanishes at @xmath22 and has @xmath23 . by the wordgeneric \" ,",
    "we mean the graph @xmath24 should intersect @xmath25 at @xmath26 in a transverse way . then the local morse brane , denoted as @xmath27 , is defined by extending @xmath24 in an appropriate way , so that @xmath27 lives over a small neighborhood of @xmath22 , and @xmath27 has certain behavior near infinity .",
    "note that the construction of @xmath27 is completely local ; it only knows the local geometry ( actually the microlocal geometry ) around @xmath22 .",
    "the last kind of lagrangian we consider is the brane corresponding to a standard sheaf associated to an open set @xmath28 under the microlocal functor @xmath8 .",
    "the construction is very easy .",
    "take a function @xmath29 on @xmath0 with @xmath30 on @xmath31 and @xmath32 on @xmath28 , then the lagrangian is the graph @xmath33 , which lives over @xmath28 .",
    "we will call such a brane a _",
    "standard brane _ and denote it by @xmath34 .",
    "we have been mixing up the terminology lagrangian and lagrangian brane freely , since the lagrangians @xmath27 and @xmath34 will be equipped with canonical brane structures .",
    "our floer complex calculations show the following :    under certain assumptions on the boundary of @xmath28 , we have @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a small ball around @xmath22 and the first identification is a canonical quasi - isomorphism .    an illustrating picture is not in a complex manifold , but it will become clear that the construction of local morse brane generalizes to the real setting ; also see section [ lmgf ] ] for the branes @xmath38 and @xmath27 in the case of @xmath39 is presented in figure [ morse ] , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the standard brane @xmath34 corresponds to the sheaf @xmath43 , and one can check that ( [ hf1 ] ) holds and compare it with ( [ mstandard ] ) .    morse.pdf ( 74,74)@xmath44 ( 47,46)@xmath34 ( 74,16)@xmath45 ( 30,36)@xmath46 ( 61,35)@xmath47 ( 87,35)@xmath48      there are roughly two characterizations of perverse sheaves .",
    "one is characterized by the vanishing degrees of the cohomological ( co)stalks of sheaves .",
    "the other is the microlocal ( or morse theoretic ) approach using vanishing property of the microlocal stalks ( or local morse groups ) of a sheaf .",
    "these are due to beilinson - bernstein - deligne@xcite , kashiwara - schapira@xcite and goresky - macpherson@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will mainly adopt the latter one .",
    "we also include a path from ( co)stalk characterization to the microlocal characterization in section [ lmg ] .",
    "the microlocal stalk of a sheaf is a measurement of the change of sections of the sheaf when propagating along the direction determined by a given covector in @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath49 be a sheaf whose cohomology sheaf is constructible with respect to some stratification @xmath50 .",
    "there is the standard conical lagrangian @xmath51 in @xmath3 associated to @xmath50 , which is the union of all the conormals to the strata .",
    "now pick a smooth point @xmath26 in @xmath52 , and choose a sufficiently generic holomorphic function @xmath21 near @xmath22 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( this is exactly the same condition we put on @xmath21 when we construct @xmath27 in [ hf ] ) . the microlocal stalk ( or local morse group ) @xmath55 of @xmath49 is defined to be @xmath56 for sufficiently small ball @xmath37 .",
    "in particular if @xmath49 is @xmath43 , the standard sheaf associated an open embedding @xmath57 , then one gets @xmath58    recall that @xmath10 sends @xmath43 to @xmath34 , and standard sheaves associated to open sets generate the category @xmath1 .",
    "so comparing ( [ mstandard ] ) with ( [ hf1 ] ) , one almost sees that the functor @xmath59 on @xmath6 is equivalent to the functor @xmath60 on @xmath1 under the nadler - zaslow correspondence .",
    "this is confirmed by studying composition maps on the @xmath9-level .    with the same assumptions as above plus",
    "the further assumption that @xmath50 is a complex stratification , the microlocal characterization of a perverse sheaf is very simple . it says that @xmath49 is a perverse sheaf if and only if the cohomology of the microlocal stalk @xmath55 is concentrated in degree 0 for all choices of @xmath26 . for a holomorphic lagrangian brane @xmath14 ,",
    "it is not hard to prove that @xmath15 is a sheaf whose cohomology sheaf is constructible with respect to a complex stratification .",
    "now it is easy to see that ( [ hf2 ] ) directly implies our main theorem ( theorem [ main ] ) .",
    "the preliminaries are included in the appendices .",
    "we first collect basic material on analytic - geometric categories , since this is a reasonable setting for stratification theory ( hence for constructible sheaves ) and for lagrangian branes .",
    "then we give a short account of @xmath9-categories , which is the algebra basics for fukaya category .",
    "lastly , we give an overview of the defininition of infinitesimal fukaya categories , with some specific account for @xmath2 to supplement the main content .",
    "section [ lmg ] starts from basic definitions and properties of constructible sheaves and perverse sheaves , then heads towards the microlocal characterization of a perverse sheaf .",
    "section [ nzcorr ] gives an overview of nadler - zaslow correspondence , with detailed discussion on several aspects , including morse trees and the use of homological perturbation lemma , since similar techniques will be applied in the later sections .",
    "section [ repr m_x , f ] devotes to the construction of the local morse brane @xmath27 and the proof that it corresponds to the local morse group functor @xmath61 on the sheaf side . in section [ sectionhf ]",
    ", we show the proof of ( [ hf2 ] ) and conclude with our main theorem , some consequences and generalizations .",
