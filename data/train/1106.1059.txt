    "the discovery of two - dimensional ( 2d )  @xcite and three - dimensional ( 3d )  @xcite topological insulator phases in materials with strong spin - orbit coupling has stimulated vigorous research in this field  @xcite .",
    "topological insulators ( tis ) are distinct from ordinary band insulators and semimetals by the presence of protected surface ( in 3d ) or edge ( in 2d ) states . in a 3d",
    "ti the surface state has a dirac - cone spectrum with zero band gap as a consequence of time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "if trs is broken , an energy gap is induced at the dirac point , and the surface state exhibits the quantum hall ( qh ) effect  @xcite and rich magneto - electric phenomena  @xcite related to axion electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the 2d tis have been realized in hgte / cdte quantum wells ( qws )  @xcite .",
    "their electronic bands form a single double - degenerate dirac valley  @xcite .",
    "the double degeneracy of the qw bands allows for an energy gap at the dirac point without trs breaking , so that the conduction electrons mimic the behaviour of massive dirac fermions with specific mobility  @xcite and weak antilocalization effects  @xcite .",
    "the unique feature of the hgte / cdte qws is that their band gap inverts its sign upon changing the thickness of the hgte layer  @xcite .",
    "the topologically nontrivial phase - the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) state  @xcite - occurs when the fermi level lies within the inverted band gap and is characterized by gapless quasi - one - dimensional states on sample edges , while the states in the 2d bulk are fully gapped . unlike the chiral qh edge states  @xcite the edge modes of a qsh insulator possess the trs because they accommodate counter - propagating opposite - spin electrons and , for this reason ,",
    "are frequently , called helical .",
    "one particular consequence of the trs is that the counter - propagating helical channels have the same group velocities .    in experiments on hgte",
    "/ cdte qws  @xcite , the qsh state was detected by measuring the longitudinal electric conductance of two spin channels propagating in the same direction on opposite edges of the sample .",
    "this finding was further substantiated by the observed suppression of the edge transport in an external magnetic field  @xcite , which is expected since the magnetic breaks the trs .",
    "however , the concrete scenario of the trs breaking may depend on a number of poorly controlled factors such as the degree of bulk - inversion asymmetry , strength and type of disorder  @xcite , which require further investigations .    in this paper",
    "we characterize the trs breaking in the qsh regime in terms of the modification of the edge - state dispersion in a magnetic field .",
    "we demonstrate that the counter - propagating helical edge states persist in a strong quantizing magnetic field due to the fact that they are protected by the band gap .",
    "however , they have now distinctly different group velocities : one of the edge modes merges with the bulk lowest landau level and therefore becomes slower than the other ( see also fig .",
    "[ edge ] ) . at the band gap energy ( corresponding to the bulk lowest landau level ) the edge spectrum changes from helical to chiral .",
    "such a transformation occurs as the fermi level is driven from the band gap into the landau - quantized conduction or valence band where a dissipationless qh state sets in .",
    "we find that in the qsh regime ( i.e. below the band gap ) the `` slow '' and `` fast '' edge modes are prone to get coupled by weak disorder that generates backscattering between the counter - propagating channels .",
    "this leads to suppression of the two - terminal longitudinal edge conductance @xmath0 as a function of both fermi energy and magnetic field @xmath1 : @xmath2 here @xmath3 indicates the position of the fermi level with respect to the band gap energy @xmath4 .",
    "equation ( [ g_as ] ) contrasts the behaviour of the zero - field conductance which increases as the fermi level is pushed into the metallic - type conduction or valence band  @xcite . also , unlike the exponential @xmath1 decay in strongly disordered systems  @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ g_as ] ) describes a power - law magnetoconductance .",
    "equation ( [ g_as ] ) assumes the presence of a few ( @xmath5 ) backscattering centers on the edge such as sample inhomogeneities where electronic trap states can interact with the edge channels randomizing their propagation directions  @xcite .",
    "although in a zero field this effect is believed to be weak , we show that near the band gap the backscattering is dramatically enhanced due to the flattening of the dispersion of one of the coupled qsh modes . according to eq .",
    "( [ g_as ] ) , the analysis of the power of the magnetoconductance decay can be a useful tool to determine the quality of the qsh devices .",
    "we will first analyze the edge states in scattering - free hgte qws using the effective 4-band model derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this approach one works in the basis of the four states near the @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) point of the brillouin zone : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the s - like electron and p - like hole qw subbands , respectively .",
    "the index @xmath14 accounts for the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the effective 2d hamiltonian can be approximated by a diagonal matrix in @xmath15 space  @xcite ; @xmath16 where pauli matrices @xmath17 act in subband space , @xmath18ms@xmath19 is the effective velocity  @xcite , and @xmath20 determines the band gap @xmath21 at @xmath7 . in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) we omit the terms @xmath22 , which are small near the @xmath6 point , and assume no coupling between the kramers partners , which is a good approximation for symmetric hgte quantum wells  @xcite .",
    "up to a unitary transformation , eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) is equivalent to a massive dirac hamiltonian @xmath23 @xmath24 is the pauli matrix in spin space .",
    "following the previous studies of edge states in graphene  @xcite we will work with the matrix retarded green s function defined by the equation @xmath25{\\hat g}({\\bf r},{\\bf r}^\\prime)=i \\delta ( { \\bf r}-{\\bf r}^\\prime ) , \\label{eq_g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 @xmath27 is the vector potential of an external magnetic field @xmath1 , and @xmath28 . assuming a sufficiently wide sample , we find @xmath29 near one of the edges , e.g. @xmath30 , using the boundary condition @xmath31 equivalent to confinement by infinite `` mass '' at @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this boundary condition can be obtained by introducing a large mass term ( @xmath33 ) outside the physical area of the system  @xcite .",
    "our results do not however strongly depend on the choice of the boundary condition since the origin of the qsh edge states is topological : a mass domain wall in the inverted regime with @xmath34 in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath35 is diagonal in @xmath36 space , and each @xmath37 can be diagonalized in e , h space : @xmath38 expanding @xmath39 in plane waves @xmath40 yields the boundary problem for the diagonal elements : @xmath41g_{ee|\\tau k}= \\frac{\\lambda(\\epsilon + \\tau m)}{\\hbar^2\\upsilon^2}\\delta ( z - z^\\prime ) , & \\label{eq1}\\\\ & \\left.\\partial_z g_{ee|\\tau k } = q\\ , g_{ee|\\tau k}\\right|_{z=0 } , \\ , q=\\frac{\\lambda(\\tau \\varepsilon + m)}{\\hbar \\upsilon }   -\\lambda k , & \\label{bc1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the equations for @xmath46 are obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ bc1 ] ) by replacement @xmath47 .",
    "the detailed solution to eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ bc1 ] ) has been given in ref .",
    "the outcome of these calculations is that the green s function @xmath48 can be expressed in terms of the parabolic cylinder function @xmath49 @xcite as follows @xmath50 the last term is the contribution of the edge , whereas @xmath51 , \\label{g_ee_bulk}\\\\ c & = & -\\lambda ( \\epsilon + \\tau m)\\gamma(a + 1/2)/\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\hbar^2\\upsilon^2 , \\label{c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the green s function of the unbounded system ( source term ) , where @xmath52 is euler s gamma function .",

    "@xmath57 given by @xmath58 the new feature of solution ( [ g ] ) is that it is valid for an arbitrary parameter @xmath59 which measures the magnetic field strength .",
    "below we compare _ weak_- and _ strong_-field regimes defined by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the edge - state spectrum is given by the poles of eq .",

    "[ edge](a ) and ( b ) ] , which is observed at the critical qw thickness @xmath64 nm  @xcite .",
    "the qsh state has two gapless counter - propagating spin channels which are exponentially localized at the edge for weak magnetic fields , as seen from eq .",

    "the magnetic field only shifts the zero - energy point @xmath70 with no effect on transport .    as the magnetic field does not open a gap , the qsh state persists in strong fields @xmath71 , though the qsh channels are no longer localized at the edge [ see , solid curves in fig .  [ g_z ] ] .",
    "the electron function @xmath72 for @xmath54 [ or the hole one @xmath73 for @xmath74 behaves almost like the lowest - landau - level bulk wave function peaked at the center of oscillator @xmath75 .",
    "the other functions are small at @xmath76 .",
    "the strong - field asymptotic is obtained for @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 in eqs .",
    "( [ g ] ) and ( [ alpha ] ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the complementary error function .",
    "however , the most essential distinction of this regime is the _ nonlinear _ spectrum ( [ e_strong ] ) . upon crossing the gap energy @xmath82 it changes from helical to chiral , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ edge](c ) .",
    "therefore , the qsh state transforms into a dissipationless @xmath83 qh state  @xcite .",
    "the transition between the qsh and qh regimes can be accessed experimentally through the gate - voltage ( i.e. energy ) dependence of the longitudinal magnetoconductance .",
    "to analyze such a dependence ( see next section ) we will need the group velocities , @xmath84 and the center - of - oscillator coordinates , @xmath85 , which are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ e_strong ] ) linearized near given energy , @xmath86 here @xmath87 is the solution of equation @xmath88 , which is related to the velocity by @xmath89 consequently , in strong fields the edge state can be described by the one - dimensional green s function , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is localized within @xmath92 [ see , eq .  ( [ alpha_strong ] ) ] . using the linearized dispersion ( [ e_lin ] )",

    "we now calculate the two - terminal magnetoconductance of a qsh system in the presence of backscattering centers , i.e. defects causing the scattering between the counter - propagating channels [ see , fig .",
    "[ geo ] ] .",
    "microscopically , such scattering can be mediated by interaction with electronic trap states which are likely to exist even in high quality samples  @xcite . since the edges are assumed decoupled , it is sufficient to do the calculation for one of them , e.g. , for the lower edge in fig .",
    "[ geo ] . the scattering matrix for the edge",
    "can be decomposed in two parts : @xmath96 the first factor @xmath97 is the projector on the electron qw subband which has the non - vanishing wave function in the strong magnetic field [ cf .",
    "( [ g_strong ] ) ] .",
    "the second factor @xmath98 is the scattering matrix connecting right ( `` + ' ' ) - and left ( `` -'')- moving electron states with corresponding reflection @xmath99 and transmission @xmath100 amplitudes .",
    "the conductance can be calculated as @xmath101 using fisher - lee relation  @xcite , @xmath102 between @xmath103 and the diagonal element @xmath104 of the green s function , @xmath105 which is a matrix in space of the right- and left - movers and has _ off - diagonal _ elements due to backscattering .",
    "we model the backscatterers by the sum of @xmath5 potentials , localized at positions @xmath106 with non - zero matrix elements @xmath107 between the right- and left - moving states : @xmath108 note that choosing the other off - diagonal matrix , @xmath109 does not change the final result",

    "let us look first at the particular cases @xmath117 and @xmath118 : @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "clearly , for arbitrary @xmath5 the conductance contains the cross product @xmath124 arising from the simultaneous scattering from @xmath5 potentials .",
    "this is the most divergent term when one of the velocities @xmath125 vanishes near the band gap , @xmath126 ( e.g. @xmath127 in fig .",
    "[ edge](c ) ) .",
    "such strong enhancement of the backscattering leads to the suppressed conductance , @xmath128 using eq .",
    "( [ zv ] ) we obtain the qualitative energy and field dependence of the conductance discussed earlier in the introduction [ see , eq .",
    "( [ g_as ] ) ] .    in a wider range of energies and",
    "fields the typical behavior of the conductance can be understood from eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) assuming two backscattering centers on the edge .",
    "first of all , it is easy to verify that eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) is valid not only for strong fields , but also in the weak - field case where the unperturbed green s function is given by eq .",
    "( [ g_weak ] ) .",
    "since the weak - field spectrum is linear @xmath129 , we have @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "we have shown that , albeit persistent in a strong magnetic field , the counter - propagating states acquire different group velocities",
    ". in particular , at the band gap the helical spectrum turns chiral : one of the edge states merges with the dispersionless bulk landau level , whereas the other remains propagating , which corresponds to the onset of the @xmath142 quantum hall state . due to the drastically different group velocities of the helical modes ,",
