    "electromagnetic calorimeters are fundamental elements of numerous experiments ranging from nuclear to hadronic and high - energy physics .",
    "their main goal is to measure precisely the energy of the detected electrons and photons .",
    "the depth of the calorimeters is generally taken to be large enough to avoid energy leaks and to allow a full development of the electromagnetic shower created by the incident particles .",
    "in addition to the energy measurement , the impact position of particles , corresponding to the shower central position in case of normal incidence , is usually required in order to provide refined information as particle identification .",
    "indeed , the knowledge of the photon or the electron energy and both the impact and interaction vertex positions allow the determination of the particle four - vector .",
    "this is of direct relevance for instance in the experimental determination of the origin of two photon events from the decay of @xmath0- or @xmath1-mesons where the 2@xmath2-invariant mass allows identifying the meson nature .",
    "it has been shown is some experiments , that the spatial resolution is of equal importance than the energy resolution for particle identification  @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the particle impact position requires a laterally segmented calorimeter where the energy is released in a cluster of adjacent blocks .",
    "the impact position can then be determined using the energy deposited in each block .",
    "laterally segmented calorimeters such as lead - fluoride ( pbf@xmath3 ) are frequently employed to determine the energy and the position of the showering particle  .",
    "this high - density material has a short radiation length ( @xmath4 cm ) and a small molire radius ( @xmath5 cm ) leading to compact detector geometries  .",
    "many efforts are still developed for optimizing the performances of such lead - fluoride calorimeters , in particular their energy and spatial resolution  @xcite .",
    "we investigate in this work , on the basis of geant4 monte carlo simulations  @xcite , the spatial resolution of a pbf@xmath3 calorimeter for several block sizes and different particle energies .",
    "two approaches are successively considered , discussed , and optimized to obtain a parametrization of the spatial resolution in terms of the block size and the particle energy .",
    "finally , these approaches are compared and the effect of the energy resolution on the spatial resolution is addressed .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter is simulated within the geant4 framework following a @xmath6 pbf@xmath3 block matrix .",
    "each block has a transverse square shape with dimensions @xmath7  @xmath8 and large enough depth ( 50@xmath9 ) along the @xmath10-axis to avoid energy leaks .",
    "different configurations corresponding to 13 different transverse size varying from @xmath11 to @xmath12 are studied . the minimum block size ( @xmath11 )",
    "is consistent with a large enough minimal calorimeter ( @xmath13@xmath14@xmath13 ) to contain the electromagnetic shower . for each configuration ,",
    "photons of energy @xmath15 are sent parallel to the @xmath10-axis and impinge normally on the central region of the calorimeter ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . the known impact position ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) of incident particles",
    "is distributed uniformly over the area of the central block @xmath18 .",
    "thirteen photon energies varying from 100  mev to 20  gev are generated , leading to a total of 169 configurations . in each case , the response on the calorimeter is studied for @xmath19 generated initial photons : the event - by - event energy deposit in each individual block is recorded and used to reconstruct the shower central position ( @xmath20,@xmath21 ) as described in the following sections .",
    "focus is put here only on the @xmath20 coordinate since the @xmath21 coordinate can be deduced following the same methods .",
    "two approaches can be used for reconstructing the shower central position @xmath20 .",
    "the first method is based on a numerical formula depending on the @xmath22-coordinate of the @xmath23 block center and the energy deposit @xmath24 in this block .",
    "the second method developed in the present work relies on fitting the calorimeter block response with a known profile function where @xmath20 becomes the free parameter of the fit .",
    "various formulas have been proposed to determine the shower central position  .",
    "the center of gravity method is one of the most common formula @xmath25 where the sum runs over the number of blocks in the shower cluster and @xmath26 is a weight factor depending of the energy @xmath24 . in the simplest case",
    "where @xmath27 , it has been shown that the obtained @xmath20 depends on @xmath16 in a non - linear way . a term , depending of the size @xmath28 of the blocks and the exponential radial falloff of the shower , has to be added to eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] to correct from the correlation between @xmath29 and @xmath16  @xcite , the so - called _ s - curve_. many other formulas and algorithms have been discussed and compared in reference  @xcite .",
    "for example , the un - shifted estimate of @xmath20 based on here - after expressions ( eq .  [ eq2]-[eq3 ] ) reduces significantly the non - linear correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath20 and gives a satisfying reconstruction of the shower position @xmath30 @xmath31\\right)}~~.   \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] in the previous relations @xmath32 represents the coordinate of the block with a maximal energy deposition and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are related to the transverse exponential behavior of the shower  @xcite .",
    "this un - shifted estimate of @xmath20 uses only the information of two particular blocks : the ones with the largest energy deposition ( eq .  [ eq3 ] ) and",
    "the ones adjacent to the block with maximal energy ( eq .  [ eq2 ] ) . in comparison to the simplest energy weighting case ,",
    "the logarithmic weighting of energies in these expressions procures a stronger influence of low energy deposit blocks in the calculation of @xmath20 . lately , a simple method based on eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] has been proposed and is still largely employed nowadays in many experimental analysis .",
    "it has been shown that it gives results similar or superior in quality to all those discussed previously and does not need position correction  @xcite . in this method",
    "the energy weight @xmath26 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a free dimensionless parameter .",
    "consequently , only the blocks having an energy deposition higher than @xmath37 are taken into account in the calculation of @xmath20 .",
    "in addition @xmath36 allows to set the relative weight of the blocks , with a small energy deposition , used in the sum of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] . indeed ,",
    "high @xmath36 values attribute almost an equal weight to the blocks entering the sum , while small @xmath36 values favor the highest energy blocks .",
    "it exists therefore an optimal @xmath38 giving the best position reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "actually the optimal @xmath36 value , called @xmath39 hereafter to indicate the formula method origin of this parameter , depends on the size @xmath28 of the blocks as well as the energy @xmath15 of the incident particle .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a typical behavior of the position resolution @xmath40 , defined by the root mean square ( rms ) of the @xmath41 distribution , as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "the minimal value of @xmath40 defines @xmath39 whereas the worst resolution obtained for @xmath42 or @xmath43 equals @xmath44 and corresponds to the rms of a uniform distribution of width @xmath28 . the optimal @xmath39 and corresponding position resolution @xmath45 are determined for each geometry and energy configuration previously described ( sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the energy dependence of @xmath39 for different block sizes . at a given size ,",
    "the energy deposit in the blocks surrounding the central block becomes small and very sensitive to the sampling fluctuations of the shower when the energy @xmath15 decreases . including these blocks in the calculation of @xmath46",
    "could then degrades the resolution .",
    "these blocks are removed by small @xmath36 values as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . at given energy @xmath15 , @xmath39 increases as",
    "the block size @xmath28 becomes larger .",
    "indeed , for large blocks the energy of the shower is essentially deposited in the central block .",
    "having a high threshold with small @xmath36 excludes the remaining blocks and the @xmath46 position becomes the central block coordinate with a resolution relative to the block size .",
    "an empirical parametrization of @xmath39 as function of @xmath28 and @xmath15 is proposed here following the expression @xmath47e(\\mathrm{gev})}\\right )   \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] where the three numerical constants are determined from a global fit of the 169 configurations .",

    "[ fig4 ] as function of @xmath15 for different block sizes . @xmath45",

    "[ eq1 ] having then a relative precision proportional to @xmath48 , @xmath45 is also scaling as @xmath48 . at low energies ( @xmath52 1  gev )",
    ", this proportionality becomes not valid since the worst resolution one could obtain can not exceed @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath15-dependent @xmath45 graphs for each block size are fitted at high energies with the expression @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the free parameters of the fit . the resulting coefficient @xmath54 is represented on fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] for some particular block sizes .",

    "[ eq8 ] that the resolution @xmath45 becomes better at high energies and for small block sizes",
    ". however , the @xmath28-dependence of the relative resolution @xmath64 at fixed energy is more involved .",
    "it is worth noting that eq .",
    "[ eq8 ] suggests the existence of an optimum block size corresponding to an optimum relative resolution at a given @xmath15 , allowing optimizing the calorimeter block size for a given energy measurement range .",
    "a second approach for reconstructing the shower central position relies on the knowledge of the lateral profile of the electromagnetic shower .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the profile function @xmath65 obtained from the simulated response of an infinite lead fluoride calorimeter to @xmath66=@xmath67 photons of 1  gev .",
    "this response is represented as function of the distance from the shower center along @xmath16-axis .",
    "the energy deposit is here determined per generated photon , as the transverse dimension integral normalized by the initial photon energy @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the energy released by the shower in a vertical column calorimeter centered at @xmath16 , having a width @xmath70=1  mm and an infinitely large height .",
    "this profile function turns out to be the same for photons and electrons and no energy dependence is expected according to the definition of the molire radius .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the shower profile was approximated by a single exponent term and a least - squares fit algorithm was developed for extracting the shower position taking into account all of the responding blocks of the calorimeter .",

    "[ eq1]-[eq4 ]  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , that the lateral profile of the shower is a more intricate function different from a simple exponent or a combination of two exponent contributions . a more realistic form @xmath65 of the profile function is proposed in the present work , deduced from the bin - to - bin linear interpolation of the simulated profile function ( fig .",

    "the clear energy deposit in that column for the same event expresses @xmath73 where @xmath36 is a dimensionless parameter related to the energy threshold applied on the blocks , and @xmath74=1 when @xmath75 and @xmath76 otherwise is the heaviside function . in the previous equation",
    ", @xmath77 represents the energy deposit in the block belonging to column @xmath50 and row @xmath78 . fitting for each event , with the minuit package  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath79 distribution ( eq .  [ eq10 ] ) with the expected distribution @xmath80 ( eq .  [ eq9 ] ) allows to extract the single free parameter of the fit @xmath46 .",
    "following eq .",
    "[ eq10 ] , this algorithm rejects the blocks with energy deposit smaller than the threshold @xmath81 .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the influence of @xmath36 on the obtained resolution @xmath40 given by the rms of the @xmath41 distribution for a particular value of @xmath15 and @xmath28 .",
    "as expected , larger the block number contributing to eq .",
    "[ eq10 ] , better the relative resolution .",
    "however , the resolution remains constant after a certain @xmath36 since very small energy deposit blocks do not contribute significantly to @xmath46 calculation and consequently not change the fit result .",
    "the optimum @xmath36 , denoted @xmath82 here - after , is defined as the value above which the resolution does not improve by more than 1% .",
    "no real energy dependence of @xmath82 is observed but logarithmic scaling with the block size is demonstrated on fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , following the parametrization @xmath83 for large block size , the shower energy is mainly deposited in one single block so the energy threshold must be reduced to include the surrounding blocks in order to improve the spatial resolution .",
    "the relative resolution of the fit method here developed is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] as function of the shower energy @xmath15 for different block sizes . as for the formula method",

    "these four constants are deduced from a global fit of the studied configurations .",
    "the fit algorithm described in this section is obviously more computing time consuming at the data analysis level than the formula based method . nevertheless , modern computers can easily and efficiently handle this problem : for instance , more than @xmath89 events per second can be analyzed with a modest 2  ghz processor .",
    "the formula and fit methods are compared on fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] from a typical distribution of the shower central position obtained for a given configuration . in opposition to the fit determination",
    ", the formula determination of @xmath46 does not exhibit the constant behavior expected from the uniform generation of the shower @xmath16 origin .",
    "this appears as a consequence of the number of blocks taken into account in eq .",
    "it was found in this study that the average number of blocks entering eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] is approximately 4 but could slightly differ depending on the configuration type ( for instance , 4.2 in the configuration shown on fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "therefore on average , two different block coordinates only are contributing to the determination of @xmath46 in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , which slightly favors the region between the center and the boundaries of the central block .",
    "this restriction does not show - up in the fit method where @xmath82 is always larger than @xmath39 and allows a larger number of blocks to contribute to the determination of the shower central position .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows the relative difference between the spatial resolution obtained with the two previously described methods . for small block sizes",
    ", the formula based method tends to be slightly preciser than the fit based method .",
    "however , when the block size comes closer or higher than the molire radius , the fit based method can provide as high as 40% better resolution at high energies . within the present work , particles with normal incidence only are considered whereas experimentally one can have different incident angles .",
    "it has been shown that the position resolution obtained with the formula based method is rather insensitive to this angle for moderate values  @xcite .",
    "for large incidence angles , a simulation optimizable geometrical correction depending on the shower depth must be taken into account since the impact position of the particle is shifted relatively to the shower central position  @xcite . similarly , different lateral shower profile functions depending on the incidence angle can be simulated and exported within the fit method to obtain the shower position and the corrected impact position .",
    "the resolution of the energy measurement per block originates solely from the shower sampling fluctuations in the current simulation approach .",
    "experimentally , lead - fluoride calorimeters are based on the detection of erenkov light and the fluctuations in the number of collected photo - electrons dominates the energy resolution  @xcite .",
    "the generation and tracking of erenkov photons is not performed here because of unrealistic computing times and strong sensitivity to exact optical properties of crystal and wrapping surfaces which are known to differ from an experimental device to another .",
    "this effect can globally be symbolized by an additional smearing of the energy deposition @xmath79 in each block @xmath50 .",
    "this is done by adding to @xmath79 a random number following a gaussian distribution centered at zero and having the following width @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a constant related to the global relative energy resolution of the calorimeter .",
    "several @xmath91-values in the range 1%-20% are used in the following to study the effect of the energy resolution on the position resolution .",
    "the degradation of the position resolution @xmath40 is defined as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the position resolution at a given @xmath91-value , and @xmath94=@xmath95 is the position resolution in absence of energy smearing , both determined for any of the two methods .",
    "this study shows that @xmath96 is proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "fig.[fig12 ] shows the typical energy dependence of the relative average resolution @xmath97 for a particular block size . as expected from eq .",
    "[ eq13 ] , the degradation of the position resolution can be parametrized at high energies @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a parameter depending linearly on the block size @xmath28 as shown on fig .  [ fig13 ] .",
    "finally the obtained position resolution @xmath40 taking into account energy resolution effects can be expressed @xmath100 where @xmath101 is either given by eq .",
    "[ eq8 ] or eq .",
    "[ eq11 ] according to the chosen method of the position determination .",
    "experimentally , other effects such as the physics and electronics background , energy calibration , radiation damage ... can contribute to the energy resolution and then degrades the position resolution .",
    "however , in a well designed experiment these effects are not dominating the position resolution . finally , the systematic uncertainty coming from the experimental knowledge of the coordinates @xmath71 of the block centers has to be added quadratically to eq .",
    "[ eq16 ] to obtain the final position resolution but this contribution can generally be neglected , as connected to the accuracy of the mechanical design and mounting . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the obtained experimental resolution on the reconstructed position using the center of gravity method is 2  mm , in good agreement with the 1.9  mm predicted by eq .  [ eq16 ] .",
    "the present work discussed the determination of the shower central position in a laterally segmented electromagnetic calorimeter following the widely used center of gravity method and a new fit method here developed .",
    "a semi - empirical parametrization of the relative position resolution as a function of the incident particle energy and the calorimeter block size is proposed and optimized for each case .",
    "the fit method is shown to significantly improve the position resolution as compared to the formula method , particularly at high energies and for large block sizes .",
    "finally , energy resolution effects on the position resolution are also discussed and quantified .    despite the present application to lead - fluoride calorimeters , the results presented here can be exported to several electromagnetic calorimeter materials through their parametrization in terms of the molire radius .",
    "in addition , as far as simulations are concerned , the profile function at the heart of the fit method has energy and material universality features .",
    "this global study not only provides useful parametrization for the design optimization of electromagnetic calorimeters in future experiments looking for a good spatial resolution , but procures also a new algorithm to improve position resolution at the data analysis level .",
