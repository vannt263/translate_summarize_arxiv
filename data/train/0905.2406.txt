    "the phenomenon of volume independence of @xmath7 gauge theories at large-@xmath0 was first suggested in the influential paper of eguchi and kawai @xcite .",
    "it is an example of an orbifold equivalence between two gauge theories that are related to each other by projecting out a sub - set of fields . in the eguchi - kawai ( ek )",
    "case , one of the theories ( let us denote it by ` a ' ) is the gauge theory defined at infinite volume , and the other ( theory ` b ' ) is the gauge theory with one dimension reduced to a point . clearly , one can obtain b from a by projecting out from a all the fields that are not invariant to translations in the reduced direction .",
    "theory a can also be obtained from b with a less transparent projection that involves a @xmath3 global symmetry whose order parameter is the holonomy in the reduced direction ( the polyakov loop ) .",
    "there is a necessary general condition that is required for orbifold projections to become large-@xmath0 equivalences : the symmetries defining the projection must be symmetries of the ground states in the corresponding theories @xcite .",
    "thus , for volume independence to hold , translation symmetry and @xmath3 symmetry need to be intact .",
    "this was indeed shown already in @xcite ( technically this was done using dyson schwinger equations of wilson loops ) .",
    "this can also be seen in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and , to our knowledge , that reference is also the first to emphasize the role of translation symmetry .    from the lattice perspective volume independence can have an obvious importance ; it provides a potential way to significantly save computational effort in numerically solving the large-@xmath0 limit of certain gauge theories .",
    "unfortunately , however , and as was discovered in @xcite , in the physical case of qcd ( or for that matter of pure yang - mills ) the @xmath3 symmetric vacuum is unstable , and the center symmetry is spontaneously broken in the continuum limit of the volume reduced theory .",
    "in retrospect this is not surprising since qcd has a deconfining transitions when its temperature is large enough , or equivalently when its four volume is small enough . therefore shrinking the volume below some critical value leads to a @xmath3 deconfining - like transition @xcite .",
    "several ways to circumvent this problem were suggested over the years and for a review on these we refer to @xcite and to @xcite . for an updated state of affairs",
    "we refer to the review section of the first reference in @xcite , and for an intuitive explanation we refer to the second reference of @xcite .    from here on we focus on the way ref .",
    "@xcite suggested to overcome the ek instability : adding to qcd light adjoint fermions that have periodic boundary conditions in the compactified direction .",
    "we shall not discuss at length the relation of this theory to physical qcd , but do wish to mention that it is interesting phenomenologically .",
    "its large-@xmath0 limit is expected to be equivalent to the large-@xmath0 limit of qcd with fermions in the antisymmetric representation .",
    "the latter theory , in turn , is a generalization of physical , @xmath8-color , qcd to a large-@xmath0 limit in which fermions are truly dynamical and back - react on the gauge fields .",
    "thus , it is a complementary limit to the standard large-@xmath0 ",
    "t hooft limit , where the fermions are in the fundamental representation and are sub - leading dynamically . for more details",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite and to the short summary in the forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "what the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite showed is that in the presence of massless adjoint quarks , the @xmath3 symmetry remains intact down to zero volume .",
    "this was done by calculating , in weak coupling , the one - loop potential @xmath9 as a function of the eigenvalues @xmath10 of the holonomy in the small direction .",
    "minimizing @xmath11 they saw that a @xmath3 invariant vacuum , with a uniform eigenvalue density , is the ground state . note",
    "that ref .",
    "@xcite was formulated in the continuum , and due to asymptotic freedom , the calculation is reliable because the length of the compactified direction is small compared to the dynamically generated scale in the theory .    a related work to ref .",
    "@xcite is that of ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", the authors considered a @xmath12 theory describing a unitary adjoint scalar field coupled to gauge fields and to adjoint fermions . when projected by a certain center symmetry ,",
    "the action of this theory was shown to give the action of four dimensional qcd with adjoint fermions defined with one compact discretized direction .",
    "all the other spatial directions were kept in the continuum .",
    "the one - loop potential of this theory was calculated in perturbation theory , and dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction was used to define certain linearly diverging integrals .",
    "the result was surprising and the ground state was found to generically _ break _ the @xmath3 symmetry  in contrast to what one might naively expect relying on the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite prompted us to perform the study we present in this paper and to ask three simple and related questions .",
    "first we ask how can one understand the apparent difference between the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and those of ref .",
    "second , we ask whether both these studies easily carry to a lattice regularization of the field theory where all directions are discretized .",
    "more precisely , we ask if it is actually possible to reduce one of the lattice directions to have a single site , while leaving all other to have an infinite number of sites .",
    "this is different from the construction of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the compact direction was a continuum ( i.e. had an infinite number of sites and a zero lattice spacing ) .",
    "this is also different from ref .",
    "@xcite which had a single site in the compact direction , but where the spatial , three - dimensional , space was a continuum .",
    "third , we wish to know what are the bare lattice parameters for which we can expect such volume reduction to be valid .",
    "this is a question of practical importance since if the adjoint quarks need to be very light for reduction to work , then it may be impossible to study them in monte - carlo simulations . on the contrary ,",
    "if the vacuum is @xmath3 symmetric for heavy fermions as well , then the suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite can be considered as a way to probe pure yang - mills at large-@xmath0 .    to answer these questions",
    "we generalize the calculation in @xcite to the lattice .",
    "this means we need to pick a fermion discretization and our choice is to work with wilson fermions .",
    "the prime reason is that this is the fermion discretization that we use to study this theory with monte - carlo simulations in the companion publication @xcite .",
    "our calculation can also be considered as a generalization of the pioneering refs .",
    "@xcite in two ways .",
    "firstly , we generalize them to the case where only one of the euclidean directions is reduced to a point , and secondly , we add dynamical adjoint fermions to the theory .",
    "( the first time these works were generalized to a singly reduced direction was already done in @xcite , but since this was not published , we repeat some of its steps here ) .    the following is the outline of the paper . in section  [ action ]",
    "we define the action of the theory that we study , and prepare for the one - loop perturbative calculation by fixing axial gauge . in section  [ vg ]",
    "we calculate the contribution of the gauge fields to the one - loop potential .",
    "as mentioned above , this section is very similar to what already appears in @xcite . in section",
    "[ vf ] we calculate the contribution of the adjoint fermions to the potential .",
    "the form of the resulting potential is summarized in section  [ recap ] , where we also remark on several of its properties and on the way its parameters should be chosen in order to get continuum - like equations like the ones that appear in ref .  @xcite . before we minimize the potential we pause in section  [ eft ] to discuss the way the one - loop potential was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , explain the meaning of the results obtained in that work and why they do not signal any problems for large-@xmath0 volume reduction .",
    "this is tied with the way ref .",
    "@xcite treats the uv divergences of the one - loop potential , and we therefore analyze these in detail . in section  [ sym ]",
    "we return to our lattice regularization and present a map of its phase diagram along the quark mass axis for the case of an isotropic lattice .",
    "this is generalized to the case where the lattice spacing in the reduced direction @xmath13 is different from the lattice spacing in the unreduced dimensions @xmath14 .",
    "in that case we map the phase diagram in the plane of the quark mass and the ratio @xmath15 .",
    "we summarize our findings in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the starting point of this section is the action of @xmath1-dimensional qcd with @xmath16 dirac fermions regularized on a @xmath1-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice . out of the @xmath1 space - time dimensions , @xmath17 have an infinite number of sites and one has a single site .",
    "the gauge action is the standard wilson unimproved action , and the fermions are chosen to be of the wilson type .",
    "also , we allow for anisotropic lattice spacings and so have two gauge couplings and two hopping parameters .",
    "those that correspond to spatial plaquettes and hopping terms carry the super / subscript `` @xmath18 '' while those corresponding to time - like quantities will have the super / subscript `` @xmath19 '' . in principle , one can add an anisotropy in the wilson coefficients ( the @xmath20 ) , but this is not needed @xcite .",

    "we begin by fixing a gauge in which all the temporal links are diagonal .",

    "( [ asgauge])([atgauge ] ) are large by factors of @xmath56 compared to those quadratic pieces that we neglect .",

    "the action of these fields will become non - flat once we appropriately choose a gauge , but because there are only @xmath0 such fluctuations , integrating over them will make only an @xmath58 contribution to the effective potential . since we are mostly focused on the large-@xmath0 limit of the potential , such a contribution will be @xmath59 suppressed compared to that of the off - diagonal components of the gluons and as a result we can ignore these fields .",

    "what we wish to do in this paper is to check whether the theory , as defined in section  [ action ] , and for a given set of bare lattice parameters @xmath191 and @xmath29 , has a vacuum that is @xmath3 symmetric in weak - coupling .",
    "we do not need to think about our theory as an eft , nor do we need to take its @xmath110 limit and worry about canceling divergences . if we find that the ground state of our @xmath138 reduced model , defined with fixed cutoffs @xmath14 and @xmath13 , is @xmath3 symmetric , then large-@xmath0 reduction tells us that it is large-@xmath0 equivalent to the @xmath178 four dimensional theory defined with the same field content , the same regularization , and the same cutoffs . to remove the four - dimensional cutoffs we",
    "will then tune the lattice parameters according to their four dimensional rg flow . according to the large-@xmath0 equivalence paradigm , this",

    "thus in this approach ( which , in fact , is the standard one used to justify large-@xmath0 reduction non - perturbatively @xcite ) we do not add any counter terms to the action . with @xmath192 ; such terms can get rid of unwanted center symmetry breakdown in regimes of the lattice parameter space where it surely happens ( see details in ref .",
    "@xcite and below ) . in that case , however , they are not considered as counter terms : their coefficients need not be tuned like @xmath193 and the choice of the power @xmath66 is not dictated by the considerations in section  [ uvsensitivity ] . ]",

    "different choices correspond to different low energy constants of the eft .",
    "since different regularization schemes subtract the uv divergences in different ways , then one can compare regularization schemes only if one adds to the action .",
    "for example , the regulator used in ref .",
    "@xcite was minimally subtracted dimensional regularization ( msdr ) .",
    "this regulator sets power law divergences , like the linear divergences in the one - loop potential , to zero , and essentially replaces the uv divergence of @xmath151 by finite @xmath49-dependent functions .",
    "this fact makes msdr a ` dangerous ' regularization scheme in our context  it automatically subtracts the infinity , and in contrast to other regularization schemes , it does not make the necessity of the counter terms in manifest .",
    "in fact , this was already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite . there .",
    "we thank m.  nsal for bringing this reference to our attention . ]    indeed , because msdr sets the linear infinity to zero , then there is nothing to subtract and the infinite piece of the counter term ( @xmath186 in ) is fixed to zero in this regularization . since , however , the last term of was not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , then @xmath187 was implicitly set to be zero as well .",
    "consequently , the resulting @xmath151 was minimized in a subspace of the eft full parameter space , and this subspace is not special in any sense ( the point @xmath196 is not protected by any symmetry ) . therefore the fact that @xmath151 was found to break the center symmetry in a physically relevant region of the eft parameter space is a result that is particular for the choice @xmath196 and may certainly change once one explores other choices for @xmath187 which correspond to other choices of regulators .    for example , we can choose any @xmath12 lattice regulator for ( such as the standard wilson action , or an ` improved ' one ) , or variants of dimensional regularization like power divergence scheme @xcite .",
    "if one does not add the counter terms to the actions of these regulators , then each regulator makes its own implicit choice for @xmath187 . as an example , let us choose the regulator to be a lattice and use the standard wilson action .",

    ", one will need to explcitly add the counter term to their action , and tune the values of @xmath187 in both regulators in an appropriate manner .      in this section",
    "we show how the presence of the adjoint fermions modifies the discussion above .",
    "the modifications are two - fold .",
    "first , because of the fermion propagators are of @xmath202 , the one - loop divergences can be of a higher degree .",
    "second , because the dirac operator of the fermions is a first derivative in the compact direction , which becomes @xmath203 in the reduced model , then the theory will radiatively generate operators of the form @xmath204 as well as @xmath199 .",
    "these facts can be seen in two ways . from arguments of the sort of section  [ nt1d3 ]",
    "we see that the uv sensitive @xmath49-dependent pieces of the fermionic contribution to the one - loop potentials are given by @xmath205\\times \\int \\,\\frac{d^3p}{p^2},\\ ] ] and a simple rearrangement of the color indices tells us that both @xmath204 and @xmath199 are generated with a linearly diverging coefficient .",

    "the bubble diagrams are now generated by replacing the vertex in fig .",
    "[ vertex ] with a corresponding vertex that connect two quarks and two @xmath208 matrices , and by replacing the gluonic loop of fig .",
    "[ bubbles ] by a quark loop . since the trace over the dirac gamma matrices will null all diagrams with an odd number of vertices we find that for general @xmath86 and @xmath129 one needs to generalize to a sum over @xmath209 where @xmath210 if @xmath211 is even and @xmath212 if @xmath211 is odd .",
    "a simple and important result of the previous subsections is the following .",
    "if one wishes to treat the reduced model as a three - dimensional eft , then @xmath151 calculated for the action in ( if we regularize the eft with a @xmath12 lattice ) or for the action generalized to include fermions ( if we choose msdr ) , is missing the following terms @xmath213 different values of @xmath187 and @xmath206 correspond to different points in the parameter space of the eft . thus , to show that for given values of physical parameters like @xmath214 and @xmath16 , the eft spontaneously breaks the @xmath3 center symmetry , we need to verify that there is no combination of @xmath187 and @xmath206 that can make the ground state of @xmath151 center invariant .",
    "since this procedure was not included in the analysis of ref .",

    "the differences between the regulator - dependent values is , however , finite .",
    "next , a straight - forward generalization of the discussion in section  [ meaningbbcs ] tells us that in the absence of @xmath217 , the lattice regulator effectively fixes @xmath218 ( here @xmath219 are the coefficients of the terms that multiply @xmath199 and @xmath204 in @xmath151 and that scale like @xmath198 at small @xmath14 ) .",

    "@xcite sees a vacuum that breaks the @xmath3 symmetry down to @xmath240 .",
    "in fact , from the previous paragraph it seems that the results in ref .",
    "@xcite also contradict the results of our lattice calculation , in which the @xmath12 spatial dimensions of the reduced model are discretized to have a finite lattice spacing @xmath14 .",
    "before we describe how we resolved these ` contradictions ' , we wish to emphasize that treating the reduced model as a three - dimensional eft may be useful but is not necessary .",
    "in particular , in the lattice calculation performed in this paper we treat the @xmath138 reduced model as a theory that is defined with a fixed cutoff , or equivalently that has finite bare lattice parameters . for values of lattice parameters where the center symmetry is intact ,",
    "the theory is large-@xmath0 equivalent to a corresponding theory with the same bare lattice parameters , the same field content , and the same cutoff , but with @xmath178 .",
    "this equivalence is true not only at low energies , but all the way up to the cutoff scale . removing the cutoff @xmath14 from this construction",
    "is finally done _ after taking the large-@xmath0 limit _ , and according to the rg equations of the @xmath194 large-@xmath0 theory . while our approach is the standard way one defines large-@xmath0 reduction nonperturbatively @xcite , it does not mean that the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is not useful , and we still need to understand how to resolve the apparent contradiction between the results of this approach and what we and ref .",
    "@xcite find for the symmetry of the ground state .",
    "for that purpose we first showed in section  [ eft ] that the three - dimensional eft defined by the reduced model is non - renormalizable .",
    "one of the consequences of this is a set of linear divergences in @xmath151 that depend on @xmath49 .",
    "these are radiatively generated as mass terms for the polyakov loops and from the point of view of eft we need to cancel them .",
    "thus , one needs to add to the action of the eft certain counter terms .",
    "these turn out to be relevant operators and after canceling the uv divergences , they leave us with extra finite additions to the one loop potential that depend on new low energy constants ( lec ) .",
    "specifically , we showed that the finite contribution of the counter terms is of the form @xmath295 where the lec @xmath187 and @xmath206 have mass dimension three .",
    "we also identified the counter terms for general values of @xmath129 and of the spatial dimension @xmath86 ( see section  [ eft ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the counter terms constitute a subset of the operators that ref .",
    "@xcite suggested to add to the eguchi - kawai model in order to make its ground state @xmath3-invariant . in this paper",
    "we see that in the eft approach , their presence is dictated by the regularization process of the reduced model .",
    "( note that if the theory has a ground state with a @xmath3 symmetry , then these operators , when projected back to @xmath194 , do not affect the leading large-@xmath0 dynamics ",
    "again see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the reduced model , seen as a three - dimensional eft , is defined not only by parameters like the quark mass @xmath159 and the number of flavors @xmath16 , but also by @xmath187 and @xmath206 .",
    "this tells us what is the cause for the different results one obtains in different regularizations : they reflect different choices for @xmath187 and @xmath206 . to make this clear",
    "let us detail the choices made for these lec by the different calculations .",
    "a.   here the subtraction of the infinities was done with minimally subtracted dimensional regularization ( msdr ) .",
    "this choice effectively sets power law divergences to zero and replaces them by finite @xmath49-dependent functions .",
    "the fact that @xmath296 from was not added to the action studied in ref .",
    "@xcite means that msdr actually fixed @xmath215 .",
    "this choice is made implicitly by the regulator and is why msdr is considered ` dangerous ' when dealing with power - law divergences @xcite .",
    "b.   above we emphasized we do not treat the reduced model as an eft . despite this , and to understand the difference between our results and those of ref .",
    "@xcite , we momentarily choose to depart this approach , and think about our lattice as a regulator for a @xmath12 eft which is alternative to msdr .",
    "it is easy to see that , from this point of view , the lattice fixed @xmath297 and @xmath298 to specific values that scale like @xmath198 for small @xmath14 ( because we did not add to our lattice action  for details see section  [ meaningbbcs ] ) .    there is absolutely no reason to expect that the implicit choices made for @xmath216 in msdr and on the lattice should lead to the same physical results . in particular , it is quite possible that these choices lead to different realizations of the @xmath3 symmetry in the ground state .",
    "indeed this is what happens : the choice made by msdr tends to break the @xmath3 symmetry , while the one of the lattice ( with wilson fermions ) tends to preserve it .    to obtain the same physical results in different regularizations , one would need to fix the physical parameters ( @xmath159 , @xmath16 , etc . ) , explicitly introduce the terms in into @xmath151 , and tune the values of @xmath187 and @xmath206 in a regularization dependent way ( instead of letting the regulator fix them implicitly ) .",
    "then , there will be some choice within msdr , @xmath299 , that will give the same physical results that a different choice , @xmath300 , gives on the lattice .",
    "moreover , to make a regularization - independent statement on the _ absence _ of @xmath3 symmetry in the ground state of the theory , one needs to show that , within a certain regularization , the center symmetry breaks for all values of @xmath187 and @xmath206 .",
    "as we say above , this was not included in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite and so the result of that work does _ not _ mean that large-@xmath0 reduction of qcd with light adjoint fermions is invalid . put differently , ref .",
    "@xcite effectively studied @xmath151 in a subspace of the full parameter space of the eft ; a subspace that turns out to have a broken @xmath3 symmetry for physically relevant values of the quark mass .",
    "if we view our lattice calculation as an eft , then the choices made for @xmath216 by the lattice can also be seen as a restriction to a subspace in parameter space .",
    "but in contrast to what happens with msdr , in our case the subspace defined by @xmath301 turned out to generically have a @xmath3-invariant ground state for @xmath151 .",
    "is it possible to change the results of ref .",
    "@xcite by making its choice of @xmath216 nonzero ?",
    "the answer seems to be yes .",
    "for example , for @xmath158 and @xmath223 , ref .",
    "@xcite reported a breakdown of @xmath222 , and it is fairly clear that by increasing both @xmath187 and @xmath206 to sufficiently positive values , one can get rid of this symmetry breakdown .",
    "indeed , this fact is what makes the results of ref .",
    "@xcite consistent with the ones we present in the current paper , namely that large-@xmath0 reduction works for a physically relevant range of the parameters in the gauge theory .",
    "this also means that there is no tension between the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the fact that we can view the lattice definition of the @xmath138 reduced model as a regularization of a three - dimensional nonrenormalizble eft with fixed @xmath216 teaches us the following important lesson .",
    "other lattice constructions of the @xmath138 model ( for example ones similar to @xcite which use staggered fermions , or any other type of fermions ) can be seen as alternative regulators for the same eft .",
    "then , if we do not add the terms in to their action , they will implicitly choose their own values for @xmath216 .",
    "importantly , it is not guaranteed that these choices will generically lead to a @xmath3 symmetric ground state in the physically interesting regime . in that sense",
    ", the result we present in this paper for wilson fermions can not be anticipated in advance .",
    "clearly , this means that it will be wise to perform one - loop calculations of the form we did in this paper for each regularization of a single - site model , prior to its ( computationally costly ) numerical monte - carlo study .",
    "the question of whether the @xmath3 symmetry is intact in our regularization also at moderate couplings , where the one - loop calculation is unreliable , can be answered only via non - perturbative monte - carlo simulations .",
    "for example , in the @xmath268 case , the study in ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that the answer is rather complicated and may be sensitive to the bare lattice parameters .",
    "the results we present in section  [ asym ] on the phase structure in the @xmath302 plane can be viewed as another example of a moderate case of this sensitivity , which is harmless for the large-@xmath0 reduction program .",
    "indeed , in the companion publication @xcite non - perturbative monte - carlo simulations were used to explore large-@xmath0 reduction and find evidence that for some values of the lattice coupling and quark masses , the theory with symmetric lattice spacings can be successfully reduced to a single site in _ all _ the euclidean directions . anticipating this result using a one loop calculation",
    "is , unfortunately , not straightforward , and compared to the one - loop calculation presented in this paper , is complicated by ir divergences .",
    "these need to be taken into account in a similar fashion to the way ref .",
    "@xcite estimated the free energy of singular tolerons .",
    "nonetheless , the values of the quark mass at which we see a transition from a @xmath3 broken phase into a @xmath3 invariant phase in the monte - carlo simulations of ref .",
