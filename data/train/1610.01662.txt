    "perhaps the most crucial structural change is the transition from sparse networks for @xmath1 , where the number of links @xmath9 in a network of @xmath3 nodes grows linearly with @xmath3 , to dense networks , where @xmath9 grows super - linearly with @xmath3 . in the sparse regime ,",
    "the network is `` normal '' in the sense that a typical realization of the network is representative of the average behavior .",
    "in contrast , in the dense regime , @xmath10 , network growth is not self - averaging ; namely sample - to - sample fluctuations do not vanish even when the number of nodes @xmath3 is very large .",

    "[ sec : links ] we quantify the simplest global network characteristic , the number of links @xmath9 .",

    "[ sec:2nd - neighbor ] we briefly discuss what happens if , in addition to connecting to the neighbors of the target node , connections to second neighbors are also allowed . finally in sec",
    ".  [ concl ] , we conclude and discuss some possible open questions .",
    "a basic global characteristic of a network of @xmath3 nodes is the number of links @xmath9 . in many models ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath3 is trivial .",
    "for example , if each new node links to @xmath4 pre - exiting nodes , then @xmath15 .",
    "hereinafter we assume that the network starts with a single node , so that @xmath16 . in the copying model , however , @xmath9 is a random variable taking different values in different realizations .",
    "the exceptions are the extreme cases of @xmath17 and @xmath18 where the number of links is deterministic . in the former case the copying mechanism produces a tree ( more precisely , a random recursive tree ) , so @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath18 , the copying model leads to the complete graph which has @xmath20 links .",
    "the simplest characterization of the random quantity @xmath9 is the _ average _ number of links @xmath22 .",
    "when a new node is added , the average number of links increases by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the average node degree .",
    "the factor 1 accounts for direct linking and the factor @xmath25 accounts for copying events .",
    "indeed , for a target node of degree @xmath26 , @xmath27 additional links are created on average by copying ( fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "thus the average number of links grows as @xmath28 since we assume that the network starts with a single node , the initial condition is @xmath29 .",
    "the solution to the homogeneous version of recursion is elementary . using this solution as a integrating factor",
    ", we solve the inhomogeneous equation ( see appendix  [ app : ln ] ) , from which the asymptotic behavior is    [ l - all ] @xmath30 { \\displaystyle n\\,\\ln n      }      &   \\qquad p=\\tfrac{1}{2},\\\\[0.2 cm ] { \\displaystyle a(p)\\,n^{2p }   }     &   \\qquad \\tfrac{1}{2}<p\\leq 1 , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] with @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the euler gamma function .",
    "equation shows that as the copying probability @xmath0 is varied , there is a transition from sparse regimes arising when @xmath1 to dense regimes when @xmath2 .",
    "the average degree remains finite as @xmath7 in sparse regimes and diverges in dense regimes  logarithmically with @xmath3 at the transition point @xmath12 and algebraically for @xmath10 .",
    "the change in the dependence of @xmath21 and many other network properties as a function of @xmath0 is a major feature of the copying model .",
    "parenthetically , we can obtain the asymptotics of  , with the exception of the amplitude @xmath33 , by considering the continuum limit of . in this limit",
    ", we treat @xmath3 as a continuous variable and recast the exact difference equation into the differential equation @xmath34 whose solution recovers the exact asymptotics given by   for @xmath35 . in this range ,",
    "the leading asymptotics are independent of @xmath36 ; the initial condition plays no role . for @xmath10",
    ", the continuum solution has the correct @xmath3 dependence , @xmath37 , but the amplitude depends on @xmath38 .",

    "logarithmic and power - law densifications given in   have been observed in citation graphs , the autonomous systems graph , software networks , and other social and information networks  @xcite .",
    "network densification also occurs in models that are based on accelerated network growth  @xcite . in these models",
    ", densification arises by introducing a time - dependent attractiveness to the nodes .",
    "our approach is fundamentally distinct , as densification is an emergent property of the dynamics .",
    "we now study the variance @xmath41 , which characterizes the fluctuations in the random variable @xmath9 .",
    "this variance exhibits a richer dependence on @xmath3 than the average number of links @xmath21 , with a new transition at @xmath13 , in addition to the transition at @xmath12 . to determine the variance ,",
    "we need to consider the copying process in more detail .",
    "when a new node attaches to a randomly selected target node of degree @xmath26 , it also attaches to @xmath42 of its neighbors by copying , where @xmath42 is a random variable that can range from 0 to @xmath26 .",
    "thus the number of links changes according to @xmath43 since connections to each of the neighbors of the target occurs independently with probability @xmath0 , the probability @xmath44 that @xmath42 additional links are made to the neighbors of a target of degree @xmath26 is @xmath45    averaging we obtain @xmath46 here @xmath47 denotes the average over all possible values of @xmath42 for a target node of degree @xmath26 , and @xmath48 denotes the average over all target nodes and hence over all possible degrees .",

    "we now extend this approach to compute the variance .",
    "squaring eq .   gives @xmath50 which , after averaging , becomes @xmath51 to compute @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we use to obtain @xmath54 therefore @xmath55 further @xmath56 where the sum is over all @xmath3 nodes of the network . since @xmath57",

    "[ the last result follows from eq .  .",
    "] these terms are all subdominant with respect to the first term on the right , which is of order @xmath81 .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath76 for all @xmath64 .    the above results for the number of links and its variance lead us to the following conclusions :    1 .   when @xmath82 , the variance @xmath40 grows linearly with @xmath3",
    "fluctuations are asymptotically negligible because @xmath83 as @xmath7 . thus we anticipate that the distribution @xmath84 of the number of links may be asymptotically gaussian when @xmath82 .",
    "the variance scales as @xmath85 when @xmath86 , thereby suggesting that the distribution @xmath84 is non - gaussian when @xmath86 .",
    "3 .   in the dense phase ( @xmath87 ) the magnitude of fluctuations is the same as the average : @xmath88 .",
    "the last point implies that the number of links does _ not _ self - average .",
    "this feature leads to a wide diversity between individual realizations of the network .",
    "in particular , the first few steps of the network growth are crucial to shaping its asymptotic evolution .",
    "we now study the degree distribution , both because of its fundamental nature in characterizing the network and because the second moment of this distribution is an essential ingredient in the variance @xmath40 from the previous section .",
    "we will argue that the copying model leads to dramatically different degree distributions in the sparse ( @xmath1 ) and dense ( @xmath2 ) regimes . in the sparse regime",
    ", the degree distribution has an algebraic tail and we can also write the number of nodes of degree @xmath26 in the scaling form @xmath89 , which simplifies the analysis . in the dense regime ,",
    "the degree distribution is anomalous in nearly all respects and thus far defies a complete analytical description .",
    "finally , we will use the second moment of the degree distribution to provide a more complete derivation of @xmath40 .    in",
    "what follows , we assume that @xmath3 is sufficiently large that we can employ a continuum approach . let @xmath90 be the number of nodes of degree @xmath26 in a network of @xmath3 nodes .",

    "each term in the above sum accounts for the contribution due to a target node of degree @xmath93 in which the new node attaches to the @xmath94 neighbors of this target . here",

    "the first four terms on the right trivially give zero .",
    "for the last term , we use @xmath99 and the binomial identity , @xmath100 , to conclude that @xmath101 , thus giving @xmath96 . in a similar spirit , multiplying by @xmath26 and summing over @xmath98 gives .      in the sparse regime",
    ", we make the standard assumption  @xcite that the fractions @xmath102 are independent of @xmath3 for @xmath39 . with this ansatz",
    ", we recast eq .",
    "as @xmath103n_{k+1}&=[1+pk]n_k\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hskip 0.5 cm + \\sum_{s\\geq k } n_s \\binom{s}{k } p^{k } ( 1-p)^{s - k}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while this is _ not _ a recurrence , we can use this equation to determine the behavior of low - order moments of the degree distribution .",

    "we also note that reduces to @xmath109 for @xmath17 .",
    "this last result can be verified by recalling that the copying model reduces to random recursive trees when @xmath17 , and the degree distribution for random recursive trees is @xmath110 .    to extract the asymptotics of @xmath111 from eq .  , first notice that for large @xmath26 , the summand on the right is sharply peaked around @xmath112 and thus reduces to  @xcite @xmath113 where we use a binomial identity  @xcite to compute the sum .",

    "one , @xmath123 , is unphysical because it violates the sum rule @xmath124 .",
    "the other applies for @xmath125 . in this case , the exponent @xmath126 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath0 , with @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the feature that @xmath129 is always greater than 2 is consistent with the sparseness of the network , in which @xmath130 is finite .    numerical results for the degree distribution in the sparse regime show that for small @xmath26 , the @xmath111 quickly converge to a stationary limit as a function of @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deg - dist - sparse ] ) . for larger @xmath26",
    ", the degree distribution slowly converges to a power - law asymptotic tail whose exponent is consistent with the prediction given in .",
    "this convergence becomes progressively slower as @xmath0 approaches @xmath131 .",
    "this slow approach to the asymptotic behavior was previously observed in a related model for protein interaction networks  @xcite , and seems to stem from the non - locality of the equation for the degree distribution .",
    "the degree distribution has a very different nature in the dense regime . instead of a power - law tail",
    ", the degree distribution has a well - defined peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deg - dist - dense ] ) whose location is determined by the mean degree , which grows as @xmath132 , see eq .  .",
    "an important feature of the degree distribution in the dense regime is that the fractions of nodes of degree @xmath26 , @xmath111 , are no longer stationary . to show that the distribution is not a power law as well as the lack of stationarity ,",
    "let us assume the converse and derive a contradiction .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath119 and that @xmath111 is independent of @xmath3 . using this form for @xmath111 ,",
    "the number of links in a finite network is given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 denotes the largest expected degree in a network of @xmath3 nodes .",
    "we estimate this maximal degree by the standard extremal condition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath135 ; namely , that there is of the order of a single node whose degree is @xmath134 or greater .",
    "this relation gives @xmath136 , so that reduces to @xmath137 on the other hand , eq .",
    "gives @xmath37 .",
    "these two results are consistent only when @xmath138 , and this consistency condition agrees with only at @xmath12 .",
    "thus we conclude that for @xmath10 , the degree densities @xmath111 must depend on @xmath3 , and further , that the degree distribution is not algebraic in @xmath26 .    because of the non - locality of eq .   and the non - stationary nature of the solution , we have not found an analytical solution for the degree distribution in the dense regime .",
    "we therefore report on simulation results .",
    "figure  [ fig : deg - dist - dense ] shows the degree distribution , averaged over many realizations , for representative values of @xmath0 , with @xmath3 ranging between @xmath139 and @xmath140 . for each @xmath3 ,",
    "the number of realizations is @xmath141 .",
    "these data clearly show that the degree densities are not stationary and that scaling the degree by the average degree @xmath142 does not collapse the data onto a single universal curve for networks with @xmath140 nodes or less .",
    "it is also worth noting that the degree distributions all exhibit a single peak , so that nodes of small degrees do not exist for @xmath7 .",
    "this behavior contrasts sharply with the sparse regime where the degree distribution is dominated by the smallest - degree nodes .",
    "finally , the degree distribution is non self - averaging in the dense regime , as there is a wide disparity in the degree distributions of individual network realizations ( fig .",

    "we begin by giving a ( trivial ) lower bound for the number of triangles @xmath14 in a network of @xmath3 nodes .",

    ", we need to account for both of these mechanisms .",
    "suppose that the target node has degree @xmath26 and that its neighbors are connected via @xmath148 ` clustering ' links ( fig .",
