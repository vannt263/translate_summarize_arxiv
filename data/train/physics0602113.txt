    "diffusion controlled bio - chemical reactions play a central role in keeping any organism alive  @xcite : the transport of molecules through cell membranes , the passage of ions across the synaptic gap , or the search carried out by drugs on the way to their protein receptors are predominantly diffusive processes . further more ,",
    "essentially all of the biological functions of dna are performed by proteins that interact with specific dna sequences  @xcite , and these reactions are diffusion - controlled .",
    "however , it has been realized that some proteins are able to find their specific binding sites on dna much more rapidly than is ` allowed ' by the diffusion limit  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore generally accepted that some kind of facilitated diffusion must take place in these cases .",
    "several mechanisms , differing in details , have been proposed .",
    "all of them essentially involve two steps : the binding to a random non - specific dna site and the diffusion ( sliding ) along the dna chain .",
    "these two steps may be reiterated many times before proteins actually find their target , since the sliding is occasionally interrupted by dissociation .",
    "berg  @xcite and zhou  @xcite have provided thorough ( but somewhat sophisticated ) theories that allow estimates for the resulting reaction rates .",
    "recently , halford and marko have presented a comprehensive review on this subject and proposed a remarkably simple and semiquantitative approach that explicitly contains the mean sliding length as a parameter of the theory  @xcite",
    ". this approach has been refined and put onto a rigorous base in a recent work by the authors  @xcite .",
    "a plethora of scaling regimes have been studied for a large range of chain densities and protein - chain affinities in a recent work by hu et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the numerical treatment of such a reaction is efficiently done with the method of excess collisions  @xcite ( mec ) , where the reverse process ( protein departs from the binding site and propagates toward the periphery of the cell ) is simulated .",
    "this approach delivers exact results and a significant speed up when compared to straight forward simulations .",
    "unfortunately , once very large systems are under investigation , the numerical treatment of the dna chain ( whose length is proportional to the volume of the cell ) quickly turns into a bottleneck , since the mec approach requires the construction of the cell in its full extent .",
    "realistic cell models have to deal with thermal fluctuations of the chain and its hydrodynamic interaction , thereby imposing a strict limit to the size that can be managed . in the present work",
    "we demonstrate how to implement a modification of the mec approach that allows to simulate a test system of reasonable size , followed by an extrapolation to cells of arbitrary size .    after a definition of the problem in sect .",

    "a comparison with exact solutions ( in the case of free diffusion ) and the analytical estimate of sect .  [ sec : tauf ] suggests that the mec - e approach delivers an accuracy of 10 to 15 percent with a speed up of several orders of magnitude .",

    "the target is located in the middle of the chain , that in turn coincides with the center of the cell .",
    "the state of the system is well defined with the position of a random walker ( protein ) , which can either diffuse freely inside the cell or , temporarily , associate with the chain to propagate along the chain s contour ( the numerical realization of this process is discussed in detail in sect .",
