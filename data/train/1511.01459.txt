    "within the last decade the need has arisen for a method that incorporates quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) radiative corrections into the many - body problem for heavy atoms and ions .",
    "for example , account of qed radiative corrections , that is , the vacuum polarization and self - energy corrections , were critical in the interpretation of the measurement @xcite of the parity violating amplitude in cesium , which restored an apparent deviation from the standard model of particle physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are other areas where full account of qed and many - body effects are required , including in the transition frequencies of many - electron highly - charged ions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and in the spectra and chemical properties of superheavy elements @xcite .",
    "ongoing improvements in experimental precision and developments in many - body methods across a range of precision atomic applications necessitate the accurate treatment of combined many - body and qed effects in the generic atomic problem .",
    "the one - loop radiative corrections are made up of the ( local ) vacuum polarization and the ( non - local ) self - energy terms .",
    "the vacuum polarization is dominated by the ( lowest order in @xmath4 ) uehling potential , and incorporation of this potential into the many - body problem is relatively straightforward .",
    "the rigorous , highly - accurate _ ab initio _ procedures for calculating qed self - energy corrections to properties of hydrogen - like and few - electron atoms and ions can not be applied with the same success to more complex many - body systems ( see , for example , the review @xcite ) .",
    "there are exact qed calculations performed in frozen atomic potentials ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , though here the many - body aspect of the problem may not be readily determined . on the other hand ,",
    "the qed part of the problem may be simplified and the full many - body treatment employed .",
    "several such `` radiative potentials '' have been advocated for use in many - body calculations .",
    "these include the local potentials @xcite and the more sophisticated non - local potential @xcite , all fitted to self - energy shifts in hydrogenlike ions .",
    "there are a number of recent works where qed radiative corrections have been included into the many - body problem using one or other of these radiative potentials ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". however , there has as yet been no in - depth study of the interplay between radiative corrections and many - body effects or of the breakdown of different terms .",
    "therefore , it is important to demonstrate the significance of different many - body effects so that they may be considered appropriately in high - precision calculations .",
    "derevianko _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the effects of core relaxation on valence @xmath3 and @xmath2 level shifts of neutral cs due to the uehling potential in the relativistic hartree - fock approximation .",
    "they demonstrated how important these relaxation effects are , particularly for orbitals with orbital quantum number @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we extend the work of derevianko _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to include the effects on valence @xmath1 levels .",
    "inclusion of relaxation corrections leads to several orders of magnitude enhancement of the uehling correction to the @xmath1-level binding energies .",
    "we study also the effect of second- and higher - order many - body perturbation theory on the uehling correction to valence binding energies through inclusion of the second - order and all - orders correlation potentials .",
    "we have found significant corrections to uehling shifts for all orbitals .",
    "the underlying mechanisms leading to the large many - body effects are studied and calculations are performed for the series of alkali - metal atoms na through to the superheavy element e119 .",
    "this work serves as a preliminary study of the more general qed - many - body interplay , where the full radiative corrections ( including the larger self - energy ) are considered .",
    "since the uehling potential may be determined to very high precision and is a local operator which may readily be included into atomic many - body codes , the study of the many - body effects is not hindered by any complexity arising from the qed terms themselves . while the form of the self - energy terms is more sophisticated than uehling , and the radiative shift is generally larger and of opposite sign , the short range of the interaction means that the same many - body enhancement mechanisms apply .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : finite ] we present the finite - size form of the uehling potential used in this work . in section",
    "[ sec : first ] , the first - order valence shifts are calculated for frozen atomic cores corresponding to core - hartree , kohn - sham , and hartree - fock approximations .",
    "the many - body effects of core relaxation and valence - core correlations are studied in sections [ sec : relax ] and [ sec : correlations ] , respectively . in these sections ,",
    "details of the many - body enhancement mechanisms are presented and calculations performed for na through to e119 , with more detailed results given for cs .",
    "the uehling potential @xcite gives the lowest - order in @xmath5 vacuum polarization correction to the coulomb potential @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is the nuclear charge and @xmath8 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "for the point - nucleus case , where @xmath9 , the uehling potential may be expressed as @xmath10 here and throughout we use atomic units ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .    to obtain the finite - nucleus expression for the uehling potential , the expression for the point - like nucleus",
    "is folded with the nuclear density @xmath13 , @xmath14 where we use the normalization @xmath15 .",
    "taking the nuclear density to be spherically symmetric , and after angular integrations , the well - known finite - nucleus expression for the uehling potential is obtained    @xmath16    there are publicly available procedures for performing this integral .",
    "for example , the code of hnizdo @xcite or the expansion of fullerton and rinker @xcite .",
    "we will instead consider the case of the step - function density ( homogeneous charge distribution ) and reduce the double integration , eq .",
    "( [ eq : double ] ) , to a single integration .",
    "the uehling potential then reduces to the following form , divided into parts valid inside and outside the nucleus ,    @xmath17 \\ , & \\qquad r\\leq   r_n \\\\ \\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}\\frac{z}{r}\\int_1^{\\infty}dt \\sqrt{t^2 - 1}\\big(\\frac{1}{t^2}+\\frac{1}{2t^4}\\big ) \\big(\\frac{2}{\\varkappa^3}\\big ) e^{-2tr/\\alpha } \\big [ \\varkappa \\cosh ( \\varkappa)-\\sinh(\\varkappa)\\big ] \\ , & \\qquad r >",

    "the first term inside the square brackets of the upper line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : step ] ) may be simplified by integrating over @xmath20 analytically , yielding @xmath21 , where all factors have been included .",
    "( [ eq : step ] ) agrees with that given in ref .",
    "@xcite in a different form .    throughout the paper",
    "we take @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where the nuclear root - mean - square radii @xmath24 are taken from ref .",
    "we have found that there is agreement to all digits presented for binding - energy shifts calculated using the step - function density expression for the uehling potential , eq .",
    "( [ eq : step ] ) , compared to the full double integral eq .",
    "( [ eq : double ] ) with a two - parameter fermi distribution used for the nuclear density @xmath25 , provided the same root - mean - square nuclear radius is used .    in this work the integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : step ] ) is performed using the gnu scientific library adaptive integration routine qagi @xcite .",
    "the first - order uehling correction to the binding energies of the valence electron is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the valence electron wave function of state @xmath28 .",
    "the zeroth - order valence energies @xmath29 and wave functions @xmath27 are found by solving the relativistic equations @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the nuclear and electronic potentials , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are dirac matrices , and @xmath35 is the momentum operator .",
    "we take the nuclear density to correspond to the two - parameter fermi distribution , with the nuclear thickness ( 90% to 10% fall - off ) taken to be @xmath36 for all atoms and the half - density radii found from the root - mean - square radii of ref .",
    "@xcite . for e119",
    ", we take @xmath37 , within the range predicted from hartree - fock - bcs theory @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the effect of the correlation potential is to pull the wave functions closer to the nucleus .",
    "this leads to larger uehling shifts for all waves and is more important for the orbitals with @xmath0 .",
    "the difference between the results using @xmath38 or @xmath39 is significant , affecting the second digit in the results .",
    "however , the fitted results shown in columns five and eight of table [ tab : sigma ] , agree very well , to about 2% for @xmath40 and significantly better for the other waves .",
    "that is , _ as long as the correlation potential is fitted to reproduce the experimental energies , the correlation corrections to the uehling shifts are insensitive to the details of @xmath41_.    therefore , we have performed calculations for na through to e119 with the second - order correlation potential @xmath38 fitted to reproduce experimental energies ( for e119 , we use fitting factors from fr ) .",
    "these results , which also include the important core - relaxation effects , are presented in the sixth column of table [ tab : all - order ] .    in the final column of table [",
    "tab : all - order ] we present , along with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the vacuum polarization calculations performed by thierfelder and schwerdtfeger @xcite in the relativistic hartree - fock approach .",
    "their results are in reasonable agreement with our relaxed core results @xmath42 .",
    "we are not aware of other many - body vacuum polarization results for the alkali atoms .",
    "( see inset ) . ]",
    "it is worth emphasizing the effect of the correlation potential on the valence electron wave functions .",
    "the wave functions are modified by the correlation potential in the region @xmath43 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : cs6sorbitals ] , where we illustrate the relativistic hartree - fock and brueckner upper radial component for the @xmath40 orbital of cs . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the brueckner wave functions are proportional to the hartree - fock wave functions , @xmath45 .",
    "the effect that the correlation corrections have in this region is simply in the normalization of the wave functions . obviously , since the uehling potential acts at a distance close to the nuclear radius , @xmath46 . if the range of the correction to the hartree - fock potential @xmath47 were within @xmath48 , then @xmath49 also , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "we do notice some deviation from this relation , which is a result of the long range of the relaxation correction to the hartree - fock potential ; this range indeed extends beyond @xmath51 , as we saw in the previous section .",
    "overall , though , the relation above holds fairly well .    from consideration of the level of agreement between the fitted brueckner results of cs from table [ tab : sigma ]",
    ", we estimate the uncertainty of our final results for the alkali atoms na to e119 ( column six of table [ tab : all - order ] ) to be a few percent .",
    "while the aim of this work is to study the effect of many - body corrections on the qed radiative shifts , applied to the uehling potential specifically , we note that there are other contributions to the vacuum polarization shift at the one - loop level that we have not included , for instance the higher - order in @xmath4 corrections and remaining electron screening effects corresponding to a vacuum polarization loop in the photon exchange between electrons .",
    "a more precise study would include these contributions , though we expect them to contribute at a level that is smaller than the estimated uncertainty in this work .",
    "we have studied the mechanisms of core relaxation and valence - core correlations on the uehling shift for the valence levels of the alkali atoms na to e119 .",
    "we observe sizeable corrections to the @xmath3-level shifts , while for the other orbitals @xmath0 the relative size of the corrections is larger . for the @xmath52 orbitals we have seen for several atoms that the relaxation and first - order uehling shifts are roughly the same size and of opposite sign . for @xmath53 and for the @xmath1 levels ,",
    "the effect of core relaxation is enormous , with corrections being orders of magnitude larger than the first - order result and usually of opposite sign .",
    "account of the valence - core correlations is also important for all waves . for rb , cs , and",
    "fr , the @xmath1-level shifts become comparable to the size of the @xmath3-level shifts ( one order of magnitude smaller ) .",
    "the atomic theory uncertainty for calculations of transition frequencies in heavy neutral alkali atoms is at the level of 0.1% @xcite , limited by the incomplete treatment of electron - electron correlations .",
    "this is roughly the same level where the radiative corrections enter .",
    "( the full radiative shift is comprised , at one - loop level , of the vacuum polarization and self - energy shifts , with the self - energy shift typically an order of magnitude larger than the vacuum polarization shift and of opposite sign . ) if the remaining uncertainty in the electronic theory can be controlled , the huge many - body corrections for the radiative shifts for @xmath1 levels could make high - precision studies of transition frequencies involving these levels a particularly sensitive test of combined qed and many - body effects .",
    "the results of this work are relevant for studies of radiative potentials  potentials that mimic self - energy qed radiative corrections  for use in heavy atoms and ions .",
    "the many - body enhancement mechanisms that operate for the uehling potential apply also to the self - energy due to the short range of the interaction .",
    "we are grateful to a. yelkhovsky for useful discussions .",
    "the all - order correlation potential @xmath39 was calculated using the dzuba - flambaum - sushkov codes maintained by v. dzuba .",
