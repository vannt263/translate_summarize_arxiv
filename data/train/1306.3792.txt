    "the concentrations of ions in interstellar space are typically orders of magnitude lower than those of the most abundant neutral species @xcite but , due to the fact that ion - molecule reactions are often barrier - less and have large rate coefficients , ions play a key role in the low - temperature gas phase chemistry of the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "many of the 20 cations detected up to date in the ism @xcite are protonated derivatives of small molecules that can be formed in chains of proton transfer processes involving molecules with varying proton affinities ( pa ) @xcite .",
    "the global initiator of these chains is assumed to be h@xmath6 , the most frequently produced ion in the ism ( oka 2006 ) , which is readily generated in the collisions of h@xmath7 molecules with h@xmath8 ions . due to the low pa ( 422.3 kj mol@xmath9 ) of the hydrogen molecule @xcite , h@xmath10 has a high tendency to transfer a proton and return to h@xmath7 . among the small molecules most common in the ism ( co , n@xmath7 , hcn , h@xmath7o , nh@xmath1 , ch@xmath7o , ch@xmath11 , ch@xmath12oh ) , ammonia has the highest proton affinity ( pa=853 kj mol@xmath9 ) and consequently nh@xmath13 , once formed , will be stable toward further reactions with the most abundant species .",
    "in fact , astrochemical models predict nh@xmath13 to become the dominant ion in some warm astronomical environments where nh@xmath1 desorbs from interstellar grains and becomes available for gas phase ion - molecule chemistry @xcite . it should be noted that , in spite of the concentration enhancement provided by grain desorption , nh@xmath1 always represents a small fraction of the neutral species inventory .",
    "the dominance of nh@xmath13 in the ion distributions of laboratory plasmas containing just small fractions of nh@xmath1 has also been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "interstellar nh@xmath13 is not limited to warm environments .",
    "it is also assumed to play a key role in the low temperature gas - phase formation of ammonia in cold clouds @xcite . in this case , the suggested route starts with the reaction between n@xmath2 and h@xmath7 to yield nh@xmath2 and proceeds through successive hydrogenation steps to the formation of nh@xmath13 that transforms into nh@xmath1 through dissociative recombination with electrons .",
    "the first step in this route is endoergic for para - hydrogen molecules in their ground state , but slightly exoergic for ortho - hydrogen , and @xcite have shown that realistic ortho / para ratios could explain the relative abundances of nitrogen hydrides observed in dark clouds . in general , the high gas - phase chemical stability of nh@xmath13 in the ism , which is mostly destroyed just in collisions with electrons , suggests that it can build up to high concentrations in different astronomical environments and , given its paramount importance for nitrogen chemistry in space , it is a desired goal for astronomical searches . unfortunately , nh@xmath13 is a spherical top molecule with no permanent electric dipole moment and thus unsuitable for radioastronomic observation . as far as we know",
    ", the ion has never been detected in the ism .",
    "however , deuterated variants of nh@xmath14 do possess a permanent dipole moment and could , in principle , be observed .",
    "variously deuterated ammonia molecules , the likely precursors of deuterated ammonium , are observed in dense cores , where fractionation leads to an enhancement of the molecular deuterium content @xcite and , in particular , all deuterated isotopologues of nh@xmath1 have been detected in the cold prestellar cloud b1-bs @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic data useful for astronomic observations are available for the monodeuterated ammonium ion .",
    "specifically , a frequency of @xmath15 mhz ( @xmath4 ) was predicted by @xcite for the 1@xmath5 transition of nh@xmath1d@xmath2 ( as this paper will be often cited in this letter , it will be abbreviated n&a ( 1986 ) hereafter ) .",
    "this value was derived using the ground - state molecular constants obtained by those authors from their high resolution spectroscopic measurements of the @xmath0 infrared band of the ion .",
    "recent work by cernicharo et al .",
    "( 2013 , accompanying letter ) has established the presence of an emission line at 262816.7 mhz in orion - irc2 and in b1-bs .",
    "the frequency is approximately 10 mhz higher than that estimated by nagaka and amano for monodeuterated ammonium and thus exceeds slightly the 3@xmath16 uncertainty of the spectroscopic value , strongly suggesting that the feature can correspond to this species . in the present work we have refined the previous spectroscopic measurements of n&a ( 1986 ) further constraining the frequency of the @xmath17 transition and providing additional support for the assignment of the observed 262816.7 mhz emission feature to the presence of nh@xmath1d@xmath2",
    "the experimental setup used in this work is similar to that described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it consists of an ir difference - frequency laser spectrometer @xcite , and a hollow cathode discharge reactor refrigerated by room - temperature water , with multipass optics in a white cell configuration , similar to the design of @xcite .",
    "the ir radiation is generated by difference - frequency mixing , following the scheme of @xcite , of an ar@xmath2 laser and a tunable ring dye laser in a linbo@xmath18 crystal .",
    "tuning the dye laser , while keeping the ar@xmath2 laser frequency locked , tunes the ir frequency , which is the difference between that of the ar@xmath2 laser and that of the ring dye laser . in our experiment ,",
    "the @xmath19 laser is frequency locked to a hyperfine transition of @xmath20i@xmath7 , ( a@xmath1 component of the p(13 ) @xmath21 transition , known with an accuracy @xmath22 mhz , @xcite ) and has a residual frequency jitter less than 1 mhz and long - term stability of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the wavelength of the ring dye laser ( also frequency stabilized , with a residual jitter of @xmath23 mhz ) is measured in just 1 ms at each data point of the spectrum by a high accuracy wavemeter based on fizeau interferometers ( high finesse wsu10 ) with a manufacturer - stated absolute accuracy of better than 10 mhz ( 3@xmath16 ) .",
    "the @xmath19 laser is used to calibrate the wavemeter and thus insure its accuracy throughout the experiments .",
    "the linewidth of the ir beam is the combined linewidth of those of the visible lasers , i.e. @xmath23 mhz .",
    "the internal coherence of the infrared frequency scale is limited by that of the wavemeter . from repeated measurements of n@xmath7o lines in the @xmath24 cm@xmath9 region , and their comparison with the values in the hitran 2008 database @xcite , we have verified a reproducibility and internal coherence of our ir frequency scale better than 1.2@xmath2610@xmath27 cm@xmath9 ( 4 mhz ) rms and a systematic offset of 6@xmath2610@xmath27 cm@xmath9 ( 18 mhz ) , which is within the combined uncertainty of the wavemeter and the quoted uncertainty limits for those line frequencies in hitran ( ( 1 - 10)@xmath28 cm@xmath9 , or @xmath29 mhz ) .    the ir beam traverses the multipass cell 12 times , giving an effective absorption length of 9 meters inside the discharge . in order to improve the detection sensitivity , both the ir beam and the discharge are amplitude - modulated , at 14.2 and 5.5 khz , respectively , and the ir signal is detected by an insb detector connected to a dual - phase lock - in whose reference frequency is the sum of the other two ( i.e. 19.7 khz ) . in this way , only changes in the ir beam intensity , due to species whose concentration is modulated in the discharge , are detected .",
    "the three frequencies are derived from a common oscillator by appropriately chosen integer dividers @xcite , therefore , insuring phase stability between the three of them .",
    "the detection time constant is 100 ms with 12 db / oct roll off .",
    "the ring dye laser scans at 0.005 @xmath30s@xmath9 rate .",
    "each line has been recorded 10 times and the results averaged in a grid spaced 0.001 cm@xmath9 .",
    "the discharge is modulated at 5.5 khz through an audio amplifier , a step - up transformer and a circuit designed to avoid the transformer core saturation , since the hollow cathode discharge acts inherently as an electric rectifier .",
    "typical discharge conditions are 200 ma and 400 v rms . the relatively high modulation frequency has been chosen to favor the detection of ionic species , whose lifecycles follow closely the on - off condition of the discharge , and to minimize undesired absorption signals associated with much slower processes like concentration change of the neutral species caused by multistep wall reactions @xcite . nevertheless , we have observed spectral signatures from nh@xmath1 due to a combination of population and doppler width changes that occur with the small temperature change on the `` on '' periods of the discharge , similar to those observed in @xcite for other stable species .",
    "note that the kinetic temperature deduced from the observed doppler widths of the ions is @xmath31 k , i.e. very near the temperature of the refrigerated cathode .",
    "a 32 pa ( 0.32 mbar ) gas flowing mixture of nh@xmath1 ( 37% ) + d@xmath7 ( 63% ) is used in the discharge as plasma precursor .",
    "gas flows , measured with rotameters at @xmath32 pa ( 500 mbar ) absolute input pressure , were 15 ml / min and 30 ml / min for nh@xmath1 and d@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "in the hollow cathode discharges used , efficient atomic recycling at the metallic cathode wall @xcite leads to an extensive isotopic scrambling both in the neutrals and ions .",
    "most of the initial nh@xmath1 is transformed into n@xmath7 and h@xmath7 and the pressure raises to @xmath33 pa ( @xmath34 mbar ) .",
    "the mixture proportions , flow rate and pressure were empirically selected to maximize the nh@xmath1d@xmath2 concentration .",
    "although the ion concentrations have not been directly measured in the present experiment , previous kinetic studies and langmuir probe measurements by our group @xcite on comparable hollow cathode discharges of h@xmath7/n@xmath7 mixtures , indicate that the ion distributions in our cell should be dominated by nh@xmath13 , with smaller concentrations of n@xmath7h@xmath2 and h@xmath10 ( and their deuterated variants ) and that the total ion densities should be of the order of @xmath3510@xmath36 @xmath37 , with electron temperatures of @xmath38 ev .",
    "these density values are also consistent with estimates made from the measured cathode current and glow region dimensions using bohm s velocity @xcite .",
    "the concentrations of the main individual ions and , in particular , of nh@xmath39d@xmath2 are estimated to be in the 10@xmath40 cm @xmath41 range .",
    "it must be noted that this set - up is very similar to the one used by n&a ( 1986 ) .",
    "the main differences between them are : the ir frequency measuring system ( a high accuracy wavemeter for the dye laser in our case , and calibration with n@xmath7o ir absorption lines with 1@xmath2610@xmath41 cm@xmath9 ( 30 mhz ) accuracy in the previous work ) , the detection scheme at the sum frequency vs. detection at the discharge frequency , the different frequencies of the discharge ( 5.5 khz vs. 17 khz ) , the rather different proportion of nh@xmath1 and d@xmath7 in the gas mixture ( @xmath42 in our case vs. 1:10 in the previous work ) , the different absorption path lengths ( 9 m in this work vs. 20 m in the previous one ) and the ir power available ( @xmath43 @xmath44w in this work vs. @xmath45 @xmath44w in the previous one ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our experiment has been guided and facilitated extensively by the previous study of n&a ( 1986 ) .",
    "the major experimental improvement of the present study is due to the availability of a more precise frequency scale and a more favorable ratio of precursors in the discharge .",
    "we have recorded 114 lines between 3268.4 and 3414.7 cm@xmath9 .",
    "not all the spectral interval has been scanned . instead , we have chosen to scan selected regions around the line frequencies calculated with the constants provided by n&a ( 1986 ) . in each region , 10 recordings have been made and averaged , in order to improve the signal to noise ratio . from the repeatability of the shape of the most intense lines , and from the fact that no broadening is observed in the averages ,",
    "we are assured that the frequency scale derived from the wavemeter is highly reproducible .",
    "the predictions , new assignments and fits have been made with the help of the pgopher program @xcite .",
    "a @xmath43 cm@xmath9 wide region of the spectrum in the central part of the band is shown in figure 1 , which can be compared with figure 1 of n&a ( 1986 ) .",
    "the more prominent features are due to nh@xmath14 , which we have identified throughout the spectrum with the measurements and predictions of @xcite .",
    "our much favorable intensity ratio between nh@xmath18d@xmath46 and nh@xmath13 signals as compared with those of n&a ( 1986 ) is worth noting .",
    "figure 2 shows some more examples of more isolated lines of nh@xmath1d@xmath2 in the _",
    "p- _ and _ r- _ regions",
    ".    each averaged line has been fit to a gaussian function , to derive its line center .",
    "standard deviations of the center frequency derived from these fits are @xmath47 cm@xmath9 ( @xmath48 mhz ) .",
    "the line center frequencies have been fit to the same hamiltonian used in the work of n&a ( 1986 ) , with the only exception of the sign of the @xmath49 ( rotational @xmath50-doubling ) parameter , since pgopher uses the opposite sign convention for it in its matrix elements . for completeness , we give here the expressions used for the energy levels , which are common for a prolate symmetric - top . for the nondegenerate ground - state , ignoring spin - rotation effects : @xmath51 and for the degenerate @xmath52 state @xmath53 with the off - diagonal matrix elements , responsible for the rotational @xmath50-doubling , @xmath54^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the rotational constants perpendicular and parallel , respectively , to the symmetry axis .",
    "the @xmath57 constants account for the centrifugal distortion effects . @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the usual rotational quantum numbers , with @xmath60 .",
    "recall that coriolis interaction splits @xmath61 levels in the degenerate vibrational state into @xmath62 and @xmath63 levels ( involving the parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 above ) and that the @xmath67 interaction splits the @xmath68 levels into pairs ( involving the @xmath49 parameter ) . for a more detailed description of the vibration - rotation hamiltonian and the matrix elements used here the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite and pgopher s documentation @xcite , respectively .",
    "finally , 76 lines have been fitted , 15 more than in the n&a ( 1986 ) work .",
    "the lines that have not been included in the fit either show interference from nh@xmath13 or nh@xmath1 features , have very poor signal to noise ratio , or show abnormally high linewidth ( indicating a possible overlap ) . besides",
    ", we have restricted ourselves mostly to lines with @xmath69 , in order to avoid using sextic and higher centrifugal distortion constants .",
    "restriction to these quantum numbers , even at the expense of reducing the number of observations included in the fit , provides a better description of the low lying levels that we pursue , avoiding the correlations between parameters that appear as the number of degrees of freedom is increased without a much larger number of observations .",
    "table 1 shows the observed frequencies , observed minus calculated residuals and the assignments of the fitted lines .",
    "the standard deviation of the fit is 5@xmath2610@xmath27 cm@xmath9 .",
    "table 2 shows the resulting constants and their standard deviations ( 1@xmath16 ) derived from the fit .",
    "since @xmath0 is a perpendicular band of a symmetric top , @xmath70 and @xmath64 can not be independently determined from the observations , so @xmath71 and @xmath72 have been constrained to the same values as in the n&a ( 1986 ) paper . as indicated there , this choice of parameters affects @xmath73 , @xmath64 , a@xmath74 and @xmath75 values , while the rest remain unaffected . specifically , the frequency of the @xmath76 pure rotational transition , namely @xmath77 , does not depend on any of these parameters , so our estimation is not influenced by the constraints .",
    "table 2 also shows the results from n&a ( 1986 ) , showing that the most significant changes are in the @xmath56 and @xmath57 rotational constants . from the @xmath78 and @xmath79 values",
    ", we obtain a frequency for the @xmath17 transition of 262816.8 mhz , in good agreement with the observation of cernicharo et al .",
    "( 2013 , accompanying letter ) .",
    "we are aware that the near perfect match is probably fortuitous , given the precision of the individual ir frequencies and the statistical uncertainty of the parameters derived from the fit .    in order to summarize , based on our observations and the analysis described above",
    ", we propose a value of @xmath3 mhz ( @xmath4 ) for the frequency of the 1@xmath5 pure rotational transition of nh@xmath1d@xmath2 .",
    "our ir measurements improve upon those of n&a ( 1986 ) thanks to a more precise frequency scale and a larger number of observed lines .",
    "this frequency is in good agreement with that of the feature detected in orion - irc2 and b1-bs ( cernicharo el al .",
