    "we have neglected hard thermal loops @xcite , corresponding to screening of electric charges . knowing that they are important for computations of the photon self - energy at @xmath29 , for @xmath191 , is their neglect justified ?",
    "the answer is : yes , because these have large contributions to @xmath186 , but their effect on @xmath187 and @xmath11 separately are small .",
    "we give the outline of a demonstration below .",
    "the hard thermal loop contributions to the process we are interested in can be represented as @xmath192{$a$ } \\text(40,20)[c]{$b$ }        \\text(-32,42)[lb]{$\\mu$ } \\text(0,42)[b]{$k_1 $ } \\text(32,42)[rb]{$\\sigma$ }        \\text(-27,17)[lt]{$\\nu$ } \\text(0,17)[t]{$k_2 $ } \\text(27,17)[rt]{$\\rho$ }     \\end{picture } \\label{htl.htl}\\ ] ] the blobs represent all vertex corrections to the triangle diagram and self energy corrections to the fermion and photon lines . the result is , retaining only the terms of interest , @xmath193                \\left[1+b(k_2\\cdot u)\\right]\\\\           & \\quad\\times              \\biggl [ m^{(a)}_{ll } m^{(b)}_{ll } \\rho_l(k_1)\\rho_l(k_2 )                   + m^{(a)}_{lt } m^{(b)}_{lt } \\rho_l(k_1)\\rho_t(k_2)\\\\           & \\qquad + m^{(a)}_{tl } m^{(b)}_{tl } \\rho_t(k_1)\\rho_l(k_2 )                   + m^{(a)}_{tt } m^{(b)}_{tt } \\rho_t(k_1)\\rho_t(k_2)\\biggr ] , \\end{array}\\label{htl.cut}\\ ] ] where @xmath194 and @xmath195 are the spectral densities of the longitudinal and transverse components of the photon .",
    "the quantities @xmath196 are the contributions from the blobs ; the subscripts denote appropriate components of the tensors .",
    "the analysis of @xcite can be adapted to show that the term quadratic in @xmath195 is the dominant infra - red term and gives the same contribution as that obtained with tree level propagators for the photon .",
    "hence , hard thermal loop resummation does not change our results for @xmath11 .",
    "similiar arguments hold for the production rate @xmath187 .",
    "however , the leading terms , quadratic in @xmath195 , cancel between the production and decay rates and hence the sub - leading terms become important for a reliable computation of the relaxation rate @xmath186 .",
    "for this reason , hard thermal loop resummation becomes important for the computation of the radius and other properties of the axio - sphere .",
