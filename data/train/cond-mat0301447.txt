    "the failure of glassy polymers such as polystyrene ( ps ) or polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) under external stresses occurs either through shear deformation or through crazing @xcite .",

    "the characteristic fibril diameter @xmath16 and separation @xmath17 ( see fig .

    "entanglements arise in dense polymeric systems from the topological constraints that the chains impose upon each other .",
    "the mobility of the chains is greatly restricted , because they can not pass through each other .",
    "the starting point for the present argument is the assumption that the glass inherits these entanglements from the melt , where an entanglement molecular weight is given by the plateau modulus under shear , @xmath26 : @xmath27 this result can be derived from the microscopic tube model @xcite , which relates the rheological response of the polymer melt to the deformation of a tube to which the polymer chain is confined . with repeat units of weight @xmath28 ,",
    "one can define a typical number of steps @xmath29 ( entanglement length ) between entanglements along the polymer backbone .",

    "[ capmodel - fig ] ) . by estimating the width of the active zone as @xmath40 , kramer calculated a stress gradient between glassy polymer and the finger void ceiling , @xmath41",
    "since @xmath42 is proportional to the interface velocity , he then predicted that the system will select a value of @xmath43 which maximizes the stress gradient between finger ceiling and bulk polymer and thus will lead to the fastest propagation velocity of the fingers .",

    "however , these authors suggest a different interpretation of @xmath36 . they introduce an effective surface tension that begins to rise above the vdw value when the finger radius rises above the rms spacing between entanglement lengths @xmath33 .",
    "this ansatz is motivated by the idea that expanding the random walk between entanglements generates an additional energy penalty .",
