    "the original context which led to the formulation of the bell inequalities was the intention to accomodate quantum correlations in a _ locally causal _ theory .",
    "the clearest formulation of such a theory is due to bell himself ( bell , 1987 , p. 54 ) . in a number of seminal papers bell carefully analyzed the intuitions lying behind our notion of locality and causality .",
    "his major contribution , however , consisted in translating these intricate notions into a simple probabilistic language which made these notions tractable both for mathematical treatment and later for experimental testability .",
    "this probabilistic framework made it possible to exactly identify the probabilistic requirements responsible for the violation of the bell inequalities in the epr scenario .",
    "a decade later authors like van fraassen ( 1982 ) , jarrett ( 1984 ) and shimony ( 1986 ) spent much time to analyze the philosophical consequences of giving up either the one or the other of these probabilistic assumptions .",
    "it also turned out soon that the conceptual framework in which the bell inequalities can be treated most naturally is the common causal explanation of correlations , originally stemming from reichenbach ( 1956 ) and later adopted to the epr case by van fraassen ( 1982 ) .    since the aim of these considerations was to accomodate the epr scenario in a classical world picture , both bell and the subsequent writers used a _ classical _ probabilistic framework in their analysis .",
    "all the assumptions representing locality and causality and also the resulting bell inequalities were formulated in the language of the classical probability theory .",
    "now , if the bell inequalities were classical , how could they be violated in the epr scenario which is well known to be described by quantum theory ?",
    "well , the answer is that quantum theory with its mathematical structure and ontological commitments played _ no role at all _ in the bell scenario .",
    "quantum mechanics was only used _ to generate classical probabilities _ , more specifically , _ classical conditional probabilities _ by the born rule .",
    "these classical conditional probabilities , however , could also have been gained directly from the experiments , and indeed later they have been gained so . in other words , the original context of the bell inequalities has no intimate link to quantum theory even if quantum theory produces probabilities which , reinterpreted as classical conditional probabilities , violate those inequalities .",
    "this classical view on the bell inequalities manifests itself in various authors .",
    "nicolas gisin for example writes : `` bell inequalities are relations between conditional probabilities valid under the locality assumption . ''",
    "( gisin 2009 , p. 126 )    in the face of all these , the bell inequality has made its way into quantum theory .",
    "it has been soon formulated as a general mark of entanglement of the given quantum state on a @xmath0-algebra ( summers and werner 1987a , b ) . a quote from bengtson and",
    "zyczkowski ( 2006 , p. 362 ) might illustrate this change of focus in the role of bell inequalities : `` the bell inequalities may be viewed as a kind of separability criterion , related to a particular entanglement witness , so evidence of their violation for certain states might be regarded as an experimental detection of quantum entanglement . ''",
    "how could the bell inequality make its way to this non - classical formalism so alien from its original context ? does there exist a justification for this ` trespass ' ?    in this paper we would like to investigate a possible justification for this transition . in this justification we intend to follow the route pioneered by bell , van fraassen , jarrett , shimony and others in that we stick to the conviction that the bell inequalities follow from the requirement of implementing correlations into a _ locally causal _ theory .",
    "we transcend , however , this view in _ not _ assuming that this theory has to be _",
    "classical_. or in other words , we pose the question whether the probabilistic requirements representing local causality and constituting the core of the bell inequalities can be reasonable formulated also in a non - classical theory .    a natural candidate for such a non - classical theory with clear conceptions of locality and causality",
    "is algebraic quantum field theory ( aqft ) ( haag , 1992 ) . in aqft events",
    "are represented by projections with well defined spacetime support and local causality is ensured by a set of axioms .",
    "hence we can pose the question as to whether the bell inequalities featuring in aqft follow from a locally causal explanation of correlations in a similar manner to the classical case .",
    "since we intend to give a causal explanation for _ correlations between events _ , therefore causal explanation is meant to be a _ common causal _ explanation .",
    "we will see that the connection between a common causal explanation and the bell inequalities in aqft is not so tight as in the classical case . in the classical case common",
    "causes necessarly commute ( in the set theoretical ` meet ' operation ) with their effects . since the quantum events of aqft form a noncommutative structure , one can decide whether to require that common causes commute with their effects or not .",
    "if commutativity is required , the bell inequalities will follow from the common cause just like in the classical case .",
    "but , as we will argue , requiring commutativity is only a remininscence of the classical treatment of correlations and is completely unjustified in the quantum case ( see e.g. ( clifton , ruetsche 1999 ) ) . for noncommuting common causes the bell inequalities will turn out _ not _ to be derivable from the presence of the common cause  at least not in the similar way to the the classical derivation",
    "this raises the question whether correlations violating the bell inequalities can have a noncommuting common causal explanation .",
    "we will answer this question in the affirmative showing up a situation when a set of correlations maximally violating a specific type bell inequality has a common causal explanation , which is local in the sense that it can be accomodated in the intersection of the causal pasts of the correlating events .",
    "the model we use for this example is the local quantum ising model , the simplest aqft with locally finite degrees of freedom .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly collect the most important concepts and some of the representative propositions concerning the bell inequality in aqft . in section 3 and 4",
    "we give the definition of the classical and the non - classical common causal explanations , respectively , and show how these explanations relate to the bell inequalities . since the correct ` translation ' of the so - called locality and no - conspiracy conditions of the classical common causal explanation into the non - classical setting is a subtle point not needed for our main purpose , we transfer it into the appendix .",
    "now , the common causal explanations in the epr - bell scenario is always meant as providing a _ joint _ common cause for a _ set _ of correlations .",
    "providing a joint common cause for a set of correlations is much more demanding than simply providing a common cause for a _ single _ correlation .",
    "therefore in section 5 , preparing for the more complicated case , we investigate the possibility of a common causal explanation of a single correlation , or in the philosophers jargon , the status of the common causal principle in aqft . in section 6",
    "we return to our original question and present a noncommutative common causal explanation for a _ set _ of correlations maximally violating some bell inequalities . in section 7",
    "we briefly analyze the philosophical consequences of applying _ noncommuting _ common causes in our causal explanation .",
    "we conclude the paper in section 8 .",
    "in this section we collect the most important concepts and some of the representative propositions concerning the bell inequality in aqft ( see ( summers 1990 ) and ( halvorson 2007 ) ) .",
    "we start with the general @xmath0-algebraic setting and then go over to the special algebraic quantum field theoretical formulation .    in the general @xmath0-algebraic setting bell inequality",

    "( summers ,    werner 1988 ) .    as said above",
    ", the bell inequality typically used in aqft is of the following form : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are self - adjoint _ contractions _ ( that is @xmath85 for @xmath86 ) supported in spatially separated spacetime regions @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "this type of bell inequality is usually referred to as the _ clauser  horne  shimony  holte ( chsh ) inequality _ ( clauser , horne , shimony and holt , 1969 ) . sometimes in the epr - bell literature",

    "therefore , from now on we will concentrate only on the ch - type bell inequalities .    in the next two sections we turn to the common causal explanation behind the bell inequalities . in the next section we introduce the basic notions of the classical common causal explanation leading to the bell inequalities",
    "; in the subsequent section we generalize these notions for the quantum case .",
    "let us begin with hans reichenbach s ( 1956 ) original definition which is historically the first probabilistic characterization of the notion of the common cause .",
    "let @xmath95 be a classical probability measure space and let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be two positively correlating events in @xmath96 : @xmath97    [ cc ] an event @xmath98 is said to be the _ reichenbachian common cause _ of the correlation between events @xmath26 and @xmath27 if the following conditions hold : @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the orthocomplement of @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the conditional probability defined by the bayes rule .",
    "one refers to equations ( [ cc1])-([cc2 ] ) as the _ screening - off conditions _ and to inequalities ( [ cc3])-([cc4 ] ) as the _ positive statistical relevancy conditions_.    reichenbach s definition , however , can not be applied directly to aqft for four reasons .",
    "first , the positive statistical relevancy conditions restrict one to common causes which increase the probability of their effects ; or in other words , they exclude negative causes .",
    "second , the definition also excludes situations in which the correlation is _ not _ due to a _",
    "single _ cause but to a _ system _ of cooperating common causes .",
    "third , it is silent about the spatiotemporal localization of the events .",
    "fourth and most importantly , it is classical .",
    "let us first address the first two problems .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be two correlating events in a classical probability measure space @xmath103 that is @xmath104    [ ccs ] a partition @xmath105 in @xmath96 is said to be the _ common cause system _ of the correlation ( [ classicalcorr ] ) if the following screening - off condition holds for all @xmath106 : @xmath107 where @xmath108 , the cardinality of @xmath109 is said to be the _ size _ of the common cause system .",
    "a common cause system of size @xmath110 is called a common cause ( without the adjective ` reichenbachian ' , indicating that the inequalities ( [ cc3])-([cc4 ] ) are not required ) .    concerning the third problem ,",
    "namely , the localization of the common cause , one has ( at least ) three different options .",
    "suppose that the two events @xmath26 and @xmath27 are localized in two bounded and spatially separated regions @xmath61 and @xmath62 of a spacetime @xmath36",
    ". then one can localize @xmath111 either ( i ) in the _ union _ or ( ii ) in the _ intersection _ of the causal past of the regions @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; or ( iii ) more restrictively , in the spacetime region which lies in the intersection of causal pasts of _ every _ point of @xmath112 . formally ,",
    "we have @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes the union of the backward light cones i.e. the causal pasts @xmath115 of every point @xmath37 in @xmath72 ( rdei , summers 2007 ) .",
    "we will refer to the above three pasts in turn as the _ weak past _ , _ common past _ , and _ strong past _ of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ pastsv.eps ] ) .",
    "the notion of these pasts presupposes a spacetime localization structure of the classical event algebra .",
    "( for such an attempt see ( henson , 2005 ) . )    now , suppose that we do not face _ one _ correlation @xmath116 but a _ set _ of correlations that is events @xmath88 and @xmath89 in @xmath96 such that for any @xmath117 @xmath118 if our aim is to explain all of these pair - correlations @xmath119 by a _ single _ common cause system ,",

    "_ locality _ ( [ lncccs2a])-([lncccs2b ] ) is the natural requirement that the measurement outcome on the one side should depend only on the measurement choice on the same side and the value of the common cause but not on the measurement choice on the opposite side .",

    "these conditional probabilities , however , could also have been directly obtained from the laboratory and in the actual experiments they are gained in this direct way indeed .",
    "so it is completely satisfactory to interpret the epr scenario  in accord with the quote from gisin in the introduction  as a classical situation with classical conditional correlation ( between detector clicks ) violating the classical ch inequality ( [ ch ] ) ( see ( szab 1998 ) ) .",

    "the above epr situation is to adopt another mathematical formalism , the formalism of quantum theory . here",
    "events are represented as projections of the von neumann lattice of the tensor product matrix algebra @xmath163 and probabilities are gained by the quantum states .",

    ", first we have to generalize the notions of this section to the quantum case .",
    "let us first generalize the notion of the common cause system to the quantum case in the following way . replace the classical probability measure space @xmath103 by the non - classical probability measure space @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the ( non - distributive ) lattice of projections ( events ) and @xmath11 is a state of a von neumann algebra @xmath170 .",

    "the image of this map is a unital subalgebra of @xmath170 containing exactly those elements that commute with @xmath185 .",

    "we can define the notion of the common cause system in the non - classical case :    [ ncqccs ] a partition of the unit @xmath188 is said to be the _ common cause system _ of the commuting events @xmath189 , which correlate in the state @xmath190 , if for those @xmath106 for which @xmath191 , the following condition holds : @xmath192 if @xmath193 commutes with both @xmath26 and @xmath27 for all @xmath106 , we call @xmath105 a _ commuting _ common cause system , otherwise a _ noncommuting _ one . a common cause system of size @xmath194 is called a _ common cause_.    some remarks are in place here .",
    "first , using the ` theorem of total probability ' the common cause condition ( [ ncqccs0 ] ) can be written as @xmath195 one can even allow here the case @xmath196 , since then both sides of ( [ ncqccs2 ] ) are zero .",
    "second , the non - classical character of the common cause system of definition [ ncqccs ] lies in the fact that the common cause system need _ not _ commute with the correlating events . if the events @xmath26 and @xmath27 commute with @xmath197 , then not only @xmath198 but also @xmath199 , and therefore @xmath200 , for example .",

    "if @xmath105 is a _ commuting _ joint common cause system , then @xmath201 drops out from the above expression since all the arguments are in @xmath232 ( see the remark before ( [ ncqccs2 ] ) ) .",

    "it is so because otherwise the support of @xmath105 would be spacelike separated from those of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and hence @xmath233 would be a _ commuting _ joint common cause system for a set of correlations violating the ch inequality ( [ qch_mn ] ) , in contradiction with proposition [ pqch ] .",

    "we pose an easier one : can _ a single _ correlation have a common causal explanation in aqft ?",
    "this leads us over to the question of the validity of the common cause principles in aqft .",
    "reichenbach s common cause principle ( ccp ) is the following hypothesis : if there is a correlation between two events and there is no direct causal ( or logical ) connection between the correlating events , then there exists a common cause of the correlation .",
    "the precise definition of this informal statement that fits to the algebraic quantum field theoretical setting is the following :    [ ccp ] a @xmath51-covariant local quantum theory @xmath47 is said to satisfy the commutative / noncommutative ( weak / strong ) common cause principle if for any pair @xmath235 and @xmath236 of projections supported in spacelike separated regions @xmath237 and for every locally faithful state @xmath238 establishing a correlation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , there exists a _ nontrivial _",
    "commuting / noncommuting common cause system @xmath239 of the correlation ( [ qcorr ] ) such that the localization region @xmath72 is in the ( weak / strong ) common past of @xmath240 and @xmath241 .    what is the status of these six different notions of the common cause principle in aqft ?",
    "the question whether the commutative common cause principles are valid in a poincar covariant local quantum theory in the von neumann algebraic setting was first raised by rdei ( 1997 , 1998 ) . as an answer to this question , rdei and summers ( 2002 , 2007 )",
    "have shown that the commutative weak ccp is valid in algebraic quantum field theory with locally infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "namely , in the von neumann setting they proved that for every locally normal and faithful state and for every superluminally correlating pair of projections there exists a weak common cause , that is a common cause system of size 2 in the weak past of the correlating projections . they have also shown ( rdei and summers , 2002 , p 352 ) that the localization of a common cause @xmath242 can not be restricted to @xmath243 or @xmath244 due to logical independence of spacelike separated algebras .    concerning the commutative ( strong ) ccp less is known .",
    "if one also admits projections localized only in _ _ un__bounded regions , then the strong ccp is known to be false : von neumann algebras pertaining to complementary wedges contain correlated projections but the strong past of such wedges is empty ( see ( summers and werner , 1988 ) and ( summers , 1990 ) ) . in spacetimes having horizons , e.g. those with robertson  walker metric , the common past of spacelike separated bounded regions can be empty , although there are states which provide correlations among local algebras corresponding to these regions ( wald 1992 ) .",
    "hence , ccp is not valid there .",
    "restricting ourselves to _ local _ algebras in minkowski spaces the situation is not clear .",
    "we are of the opinion that one can not decide on the validity of the ( strong ) ccp without an explicit reference to the dynamics since there is no bounded region @xmath72 in @xmath245 ( hence neither in @xmath246 ) for which isotony would ensure that @xmath247 . but dynamics relates the local algebras since @xmath248 can be fulfilled for certain @xmath249 and for certain time translation by @xmath250 .",
    "coming back to the proof of rdei and summers , the proof had a crucial premise , namely that the algebras in question are _ von neumann algebras of type iii_. although these algebras arise in a natural way in the context of poincar covariant theories , other local quantum theories apply von neumann algebras of other type . for example",
    ", theories with locally finite degrees of freedom are based on finite dimensional ( type i ) local von neumann algebras .",
    "this raised the question whether the commutative weak ccp is valid in other local quantum theories . to address the problem hofer - szab and vecsernys ( 2012a )",
    "have chosen the local quantum ising model ( see mller , vecsernys ) having locally finite degrees of freedom .",
    "it turned out that the commutative weak ccp is _ not valid _ in the local quantum ising model and it can not be valid either in theories with locally finite degrees of freedom in general .    but why should we require commutativity between the common cause and its effects at all ?    commutativity has a well - defined role in any quantum theories : observables should commute to be simultaneously measurable . in aqft",
    "commutativity of observables with spacelike separated supports is an axiom . to put it simply , commutativity can be required for events which can happen ` at the same time ' . but cause and effect are typically _ not _ this sort of events .",
    "if one considers ordinary qm , one well sees that observables do not commute even with their own time translates in general .",
    "for example , the time translate @xmath251 of the position operator @xmath37 of the harmonic oscillator in qm does _ not _ commute with @xmath252 for generic @xmath250 , since in the ground state vector @xmath253 we have @xmath254 \\ , \\psi_0 = \\frac{-i\\hbar \\sin{(\\hbar\\omega t)}}{m\\omega } \\psi_0 \\not\\equiv 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , if an observable @xmath26 is not a conserved quantity , that is @xmath255 , then the commutator @xmath256\\not= 0 $ ] in general .",
    "so why should the commutators @xmath257 $ ] and @xmath258 $ ] vanish for the events @xmath259 and for their common cause @xmath101 supported in their ( weak / common / strong ) past ?",
    "we think that commuting common causes are only unnecessary reminiscense of their classical formulation . due to their relative spacetime localization , that is due to the time delay between the correlating events and the common cause , it is also an unreasonable assumption .",
    "abandoning commutativity in the definition of the common cause is therefore a natural move . to our knowledge",
    "the first to contemplate the possibility of the noncommuting common causes were clifton and ruetsche ( 1999 ) in their paper criticizing rdei ( 1997 , 1998 ) who required commutativity from the common cause .",
    "they say : `` [ requiring commutativity ] bars form candidacy to the post of common cause the vast majority of events in the common past of events problematically correlated '' ( p 165 ) . and indeed , the benefit of allowing noncommuting common causes is that the noncommutative version of the result of rdei and summers can be regained : as it was shown in ( hofer - szab and vecsernys 2012b ) , by allowing common causes that do _ not _ commute with the correlating events , the weak ccp can be proven in local uhf - type quantum theories .    now , let us turn to our original question as to whether a _ set _ of correlations violating the ch inequality ( [ qch ] ) can have a noncommuting _ joint _ common causal explanation in aqft . since our answer is provided in an aqft with locally finite degrees of freedom , in the local quantum ising model , we give a short and non - technical tutorial to this model in the next section .",

    "but what are the consequences of applying noncommutative common causes ? let us see the story from the beginning , going back to reichenbach s original definition of the common cause .",
    "the reichenbachian common cause has the nice property that the presence of a common cause implies a ( positive ) correlation between the events in question .",
    "this fact is a simple consequence of the following identity : @xmath342\\big[p(b\\vert c)-p(b\\vert c^{\\bot})\\big ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is straightforward to check that if @xmath101 is a reichenbachian common cause fulfilling requirements ( [ cc1])-([cc4 ] ) then the right hand side of ( [ cons ] ) is positive therefore there is a positive correlation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in this sense the common cause provids a hempelian explanation for the correlation.)-([cc4 ] ) in the definition of the common cause . ]",
    "going over to the notion of the common cause system this ` explanatory force ' of the common cause disappears : from the presence of the common cause ( [ ccs1 ] ) the correlation ( [ classicalcorr ] ) between @xmath26 and @xmath27 does _ not _ follow .",
    "( for an attempt to define the notion of the common cause system such that it preserves this deductive relation between the common cause system and the correlation see ( hofer - szab and rdei 2004 , 2006 ) . )",
    "the noncommutative generalization of the common cause system is one step further into the direction of relaxing the relation between the common cause and the correlation . here",
    "not only the deductive relation between the common cause and the correlation gets lost , but also the relation between the conditioned and unconditioned probalitity of the correlating events .",
    "namely , @xmath343 holds in general iff @xmath344 , that is iff @xmath345=0 $ ] for all @xmath106 . that is the state @xmath346 differs from @xmath11 for @xmath347 in general , which means that the statistics of @xmath26 can differ depending on whether we calcutate it directly from the state @xmath11 or as a weighted average of conditional probabilities over the subensembles @xmath193 .",
    "but then one might come up with the following concern : noncommuting common causes are _ not actual _ but only _ contrafactual _ entities since if the @xmath193-s _ had been realized _ , then we _ would have ended up _ with another probability ( the right hand side of ( [ qtb ] ) ) for the correlating events than the actual ones ( the left hand side of ( [ qtb ] ) ) .",
    "so these common causes can not be realized in the same ( actual ) world in which those event are accomodated which they are supposed to explain .",
    "we do not consider this objection to be serious against the application of noncommuting common causes .",
    "an analogy between the notion of the _ common cause _ and the notion of the _ cause _ in qm might help to illuminate why .",
    "an observable / event @xmath348 can be said to be the _ cause _ of another observable / event @xmath349 in qm , if @xmath348 evolves in time into @xmath349 .",
    "but if @xmath348 and @xmath349 do not commute , then had @xmath348 been earlier realized , the unitary dynamics would have been distorted , so @xmath348 would not have evolved into @xmath349 .",
    "still , we regard @xmath348 to be the cause of @xmath349 . similarly , @xmath101 is a _ common cause _ of @xmath26 and @xmath27 if conditioned on it the correlation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 disappears .",
    "if @xmath101 does not commute with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , then had @xmath101 been realized , the statistics would have been distorted , so the probability of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath350 would be different .",
    "still , we think that @xmath101 is the common cause .",
    "what is important to see here is that the definition of the common cause does _ not _ contain the requirement ( which our classicaly informed intuition would dictate ) that the conditional probabilites , when added up , should give back the unconditional probabilities , that is @xmath351 should fulfil . or in other words , that the probability of the correlating events should be built up from a finer description of the situation provided by the common cause .",
    "to put it in a more formal way : the theorem of total probability is _ not _ part of the definition of the common cause . , one can not reconstruct the probability of a noncommuting @xmath349 from the conditional probabities over the subensembles pertaining to the outcomes of @xmath348 . ]",
    "the defining property of the common cause is simply the _ screening - off_.    so common causes might not be realized without the distortion of the statistics of the original correlating events .",
    "but this fact is ubiquitous for noncommuting observables in qm .",
    "if we tolerate this fact in general , then why not to tolerate it for common causes ? as we have seen , allowing noncommuting common causes helps us to maintain bell s original intuition concerning local causality .",
    "in the paper we saw that the bell inequalities used in aqft can not be given a common causal justification similar to the classical bell inequalities if we allow noncommuting common causes in the explanation .",
    "just the opposite is true : for a set of correlations violating the ch inequalities a noncommutative common causal explanation can be given and this common cause can be localized in the common past of the correlating events .",
    "thus , abandoning commutativity gives us extra freedom in the search of common causes for correlations .",
    "but how big is this freedom ?",
    "is it big enough to find a common cause for _ any set _ of correlations ?",
    "we saw that for the worst candidate , so to say , for the set _ maximally _ violating the ch inequality we have found such a common cause .",
    "but does it mean that this strategy can be applied across the board ? what is the range of correlations for which a joint common causal explanation can be given ?",
    "is this range determined only by the size of the set of correlations or by some other properties thereof ?",
    "is it true for example that for any finite set of correlations a weak joint common causal explanation can always be given ? or to put it in a more formal way , can one always find a partition of the unit for any finite set of correlations such that the necessary condition ( [ qch_mn_noncomm ] ) for a joint common causal explanation fulfills ?",
    "all these questions are still open .",
    "in section [ non - class ] we claimed that definition [ qcccs ] of the joint common cause system is the correct non - classical generalization of definition [ lnccccs ] of the ( classical ) _ local , non - conspiratorial _ joint common cause system . but",
    "how can the single non - classical screening - off condition ( [ qcccs1 ] ) generalize not only the classical screening - off condition ( [ lncccs1 ] ) but also the locality conditions ( [ lncccs2a])-([lncccs2b ] ) and non - conspiracy ( [ lncccs3 ] ) ? this is the question we address in this appendix .",
    "let us first introduce a classical probability measure @xmath352 on a common measure space @xmath353 for every element of a classical common cause system @xmath354 , if @xmath355 : @xmath356 with this denotation screening - off ( [ lncccs1 ] ) , locality ( [ lncccs2a])-([lncccs2b ] ) , and no - conspiracy ( [ lncccs3 ] ) will read as @xmath357 if one uses no - conspiracy ( [ lncccs3 ] ) in the first three equations .",
    "the subscript @xmath193 of the probability measure might remind the reader to the standard hidden variable approach where a parameter @xmath358 is used to index a set of probability measures on a common event algebra . in this approach",
    "the derivation of the bell inequalities then proceeds through the summation / integration over this parameter . in our opinion",
    "this indexical treatment of the common cause conceals an important fact , namely that the common cause and the correlating events stand on the same ontological footing : they are all _ events _ , accomodated in a common event algebra with a single probability measure . therefore the index in ( [ lncccs1])-([lncccs3 ] ) is simply an abbreviation of the conditionalization ( [ notation ] ) , which abbreviation is motivated by trying to find a classically equivalent form , where the non - classicaly meaningless expression @xmath359 of non - commuting quantities can have a definite interpretation .",
    "( see below . )    now , how does the non - classical definition [ qcccs ] of the joint common cause system relate to the above characterization of a classical _ local , non - conspiratorial _ joint common cause system ?",
    "the link is provided by the ( in our oppinion ) correct interpretation of the non - classical probabilities according to which quantum probabilities are _ classical conditional probabilities_. the quantum probability @xmath360 of a projection @xmath348 is to be interpreted as a _ conditional _ probability @xmath361 of getting the outcome @xmath362 _ given _ the quantity @xmath363 has been set to be measured .",
    "the precise mathematical formulation of this interpretation is given in the so - called ` kolmogorovian censorship hyptothesis ' . here",
    "we just state the proposition ; for the proof see ( bana and durt 1997 ) , ( szab 2001 ) and ( rdei 2010 ) .    * kolmogorovian censorship hypothesis . *",
    "let @xmath168 be a non - classical probability space .",
    "let @xmath364 be a countable set of non - commuting selfadjoint operators in @xmath365 .",
    "for every @xmath366 , let @xmath367 be a maximal abelian sublattice of @xmath368 containing all the spectral projections of @xmath369 .",
    "finally , let a map @xmath370 $ ] be such that @xmath371 then there exists a classical probability space @xmath103 such that for every projection @xmath372 in any @xmath367 there exist events @xmath373 and @xmath374 in @xmath96 such that @xmath375    the intuitive content of the above proposition is the following .",
    "a set of incompatible observables represented by noncommuting selfadjoint operators in the set @xmath364 are selected for measurement with the probabilities @xmath376 specified in ( [ p_0 ] ) .",
    "this measurement and selection procedure is then represented by classical events @xmath373 and @xmath374 , respectively : @xmath373 represents a certain measurement outcome of the measurement @xmath369 , and @xmath374 is the classical event of setting up the measurement device to measure @xmath369 .",
    "condition ( [ cond1 ] ) expresses that no outcome is possible without this setting up of a measuring device .",
    "condition ( [ cond2 ] ) expresses that incompatible observables @xmath369 and",
    "@xmath4 can not be simultaneously measured : the measurement choices @xmath374 and @xmath377 are disjoint events .",
    "condition ( [ cond3 ] ) states that the classical probability model captures the prescribed probabilities @xmath376 as the probability of the measurement choices .",
    "finally , condition ( [ cond4 ] ) is the central relation of the hypothesis , it states that quantum probabilities can be written as classical conditional probabilities : conditional probabilities of outcomes of measurements on condition that the appropriate measuring device has been set up .    applying the above proposition to our case , or the classical probability @xmath378",
    "will always indicate in which sense we use it .",
    "] we obtain that the quantum probabilities @xmath379 , @xmath380 and @xmath381 can be interpreted as classical conditional probabilities @xmath382 , @xmath383 and @xmath384 , respectively , with @xmath385 and @xmath126 ( @xmath386 ) accomodated in a classical probability space @xmath103 .",
    "hence the quantum correlations @xmath387 between the elements of the set @xmath119 can be interpreted as _ conditional _ correlations @xmath388 between classical measurement outcome events conditioned on measurement choice events in accordance with ( [ corrcond ] ) .    to see the link between the classical and non - classical version of the common cause",
    "let us first introduce a similar notation for the conditionalization on @xmath193 in the non - classical case , if @xmath389 , as was introduced above in ( [ notation ] ) for the classical case , that is let @xmath390 with this notation the definition of the non - classical joint common cause system reads as follows : @xmath391 using the kolmogorovian censorship hypothesis the classical interpretation of ( [ screen ] ) is the following : @xmath392 which is _ almost _ the screening - off ( [ lncccs1 ] ) except that the conditions on the right hand side are _ not _ @xmath393 .",
    "this defect will be cured however by the locality conditions .",
    "observe namely that since @xmath88 and @xmath89 commute , therefore @xmath394 which translated into classical conditional probabilities due to the kolmogorovian censorship hypothesis read as : @xmath395 now , observe that ( [ lncccs2a])-([lncccs2b  ] ) are equivalent to locality ( [ lncccs2a])-([lncccs2b ] ) , so locality is ` automatically ' fulfilled for the non - classical common cause due to the commutativity of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "( this fact is sometimes referred as the ` no - signalling theorem ' ; for more on that see ( schlieder 1969 ) . )",
    "moreover ( [ lncccs2a])-([lncccs2b  ] ) also cure the defect of ( [ almostscreen ] ) , since @xmath396 on the right hand side of ( [ almostscreen ] ) can be replaced with @xmath397 turning ( [ almostscreen ] ) into the classical screening - off property ( [ lncccs1 ] ) .    putting all this together ,",
    "a _ _ non - classica__l , local , non - conspiratorial joint common causal explanation of the correlations ( [ qqcorr ] ) is a partition @xmath188 if for any @xmath106 the following requirements hold : @xmath398 which using the kolmogorovian censorship hypothesis as a ` translation manual ' leads us over to the _ classical _ , local , non - conspiratorial joint common causal explanation ( [ lncccs1])-([lncccs3 ] ) of the correlations ( [ cccorr ] ) . but recall that ( [ qlncccs2a])-([qlncccs3 ] ) representing locality and no - conspiracy are just _ identities _ , and hence the screening - off condition ( [ qlncccs1 ] ) carries the whole content of the common causal explanation  in accordance with our definition [ qcccs ] .    *",
