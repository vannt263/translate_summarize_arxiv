    "compelling evidences from type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) and other cosmological observations show that the expansion of the universe is undergoing an accelerating stage at late times ( see ref .   for reviews ) . within the framework of general relativity and assuming homogeneity and isotropy",
    ", this indicates that there should exist an energy source , termed dark energy , which provides a significant negative pressure to cause this acceleration . thus far",
    "the nature of dark energy remains unresolved and is generally regarded as one of the most tantalizing problems in cosmology . while a positive cosmological constant remains the simplest realization of dark energy , current observational data have not ruled out the possibility of a time - evolving dark energy.@xcite as one awaits more information from the future observations , the constraining power of the next - generation observations and new analysis methods are being pursued.@xcite@xmath2@xcite    many dark energy models have been proposed and studied . for the cosmological constant , its value has been constrained by observations ( see ref .  , for example ) .",
    "the quintessence model , which invokes a time - varying scalar field,@xcite@xmath2@xcite generally allows its energy density and equation of state to evolve with time .",
    "there are various quintessence models with different potential forms ( see , refs .",
    "@xmath2 ,  , for example ) that have been proposed .",
    "studies of the classification@xcite and the general dynamical behavior@xcite of quintessence have been carried out .",
    "there have been also works on the reconstruction of quintessence potentials@xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath3@xcite and the investigations on how future observational data can constrain individual models of quintessence@xcite@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas ( see ref .   and references therein ) has been proposed to either unify dark matter and dark energy@xcite or to simply play the role of dark energy@xcite .",
    "the constraint of the generalized chaplygin gas has been obtained.@xcite@xmath2@xcite while these works have helped us study the possible nature of dark energy and obtain constraints of the parameters of an individual dark energy model , it should be desirable to explore possible means to determine whether a particular dark energy model can be ruled out by the observational data .",
    "recently , we introduced a new approach to testing the consistency between a dark energy model and the observational data.@xcite we tested the exponential ( see ref .   and references therein ) and the power - law potentials@xcite of quintessence to demonstrate this method , which can be summarized as follows .",
    "for each dark energy model , we look for a _ characteristic _ , @xmath4 , which in general can vary with the redshift but is equivalent to a constant parameter within the domain of the model .",
    "we further define the _ measure of consistency _",
    ", @xmath5 , as the derivative of @xmath4 with respect to the redshift @xmath6 .",
    "the observational data should allow a null value for @xmath5 if the corresponding dark energy model is consistent with them .",
    "if , however , the @xmath5 = 0 line lies outside certain confidence region , then that dark energy model is ruled out by the observational data at the corresponding confidence level . to obtain the constraint on the measure of consistency @xmath5 from the observational data , a parametrization of the relevant physical quantity , such as the equation of state or the luminosity distance , is required .",
    "we have invoked a broadly used form of parametrization of the equation of state,@xcite@xmath3@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the pressure and the energy density of dark energy , respectively .",
    "the two parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w0wa - parametrization ] ) and the normalized matter density at present , @xmath10 , define the parameter space , @xmath11 , through which the information from the observational data can be extracted .",
    "a recent work that is close in spirit to ours is that of zunckel and clarkson,@xcite who proposed consistency test of the cosmological constant via a direct parametrization of the luminosity distance . in our terminology",
    ", they use @xmath12 , which is equivalent to the constant @xmath13 in the domain of the cosmological constant , where @xmath14 is the critical density at present .",
    "sahni et al.@xcite also proposed null test of the cosmological constant via the diagnostic @xmath15 $ ] , which is equivalent to the constant @xmath13 in the domain of the cosmological constant , where @xmath16 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath17 is the hubble constant .    in this paper",
    ", we take the more recent data set and apply our method of consistency test to five dark energy models , including the cosmological constant , the generalized chaplygin gas as the dark energy component,@xcite and three quintessence models : exponential , power - law and inverse - exponential potentials@xcite . the data set we use",
    "includes a recently compiled `` constitution set '' of sn ia data,@xcite@xmath2@xcite the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurement from the five - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observation,@xcite and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite and the @xmath18df galaxy redshift survey ( @xmath18dfgrs)@xcite .    a conventional way to determine",
    "how well a dark energy model can fit the observational data is the _ model - based approach _ , in which one optimizes the parameters of each dark energy model based on the observational data and then statistically assesses the goodness of fit ( see ref .  , for example ) . in such approach one has to obtain the best fit for each set of parameters specific to the particular dark energy model , which could be tedious . in particular , in order to optimize the parameters of a quintessence model one has to solve the field equation numerically for each point in the parameter space , which can be computationally intensive and time consuming.@xcite in contrast , in our approach we first constrain the parameters of the chosen parametrization through the observational data , and then test consistency of each dark energy model based on this set of parameters",
    ". this can be more efficient than the model - based approach when one deals with a large number of dark energy models .",
    "it is also more direct and therefore much faster to constrain the parameter space @xmath11 than to optimize the parameters of a quintessence model in the model - based approach .",
    "the potential downside of our method , however , would be that as long as one invokes a specific form of parametrization , one might have simultaneously imposed a prior , or bias , against certain dark energy models .",
    "this issue requires a separate investigation and we are currently pursuing that.@xcite we note that the two methods are different in spirit .",
    "the goodness of fit describes how well a model can fit the observations .",
    "the consistency test , on the other hand , examines whether the condition necessary for a model is excluded by the observations . with in mind",
    "the pros and cons mentioned above , we believe that the two methods , that is , the model - based and ours , should be complimentary to each other in the pursuit of revealing the nature of dark energy .",
    "in this paper we consider a flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe and assume that it is dominated by pressureless matter and dark energy in the present epoch . the hubble expansion rate , @xmath19 , is given by the friedmann equations as @xmath20 \\nonumber \\\\",
