    "it is well known that exactly solvable systems play very important role in quantum theory .",
    "unfortunately number of such systems is quite limited .",
    "this considerably narrows their applications .",
    "such a situation stimulates interest to quasi - exactly solvable systems @xcite .",
    "in contrast to exactly solvable models in quasi - exactly solvable systems the spectral problem can be solved partially .",
    "nevertheless such systems are very interesting .",
    "besides modeling physical systems  @xcite they can be used as an initial point of the perturbation theory or to investigate various nonperturbative effects  @xcite . furthermore , recently in the series of papers  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) it was revealed a connection between quasi - exactly solvable models and supersymmetric systems with polynomial superalgebras  @xcite .",
    "also we can hope that progress in understanding quasi - exactly solvable quantum - mechanical systems will allow to find out methods of constructing quasi - exactly solvable models in quantum field theory .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in section  [ general ] a brief introduction into the lie - algebraic approach to constructing quasi - exactly solvable systems",
    "is given . in section  [ bounds ]",
    "we discuss constraints on wave functions of systems living in domains with boundaries .",
    "it is shown that for corresponding hamiltonians to be hermitian the wave functions must have a specific behaviour at boundaries .",
    "the role of the constraints is illustrated by an example of a known two - dimensional quasi - exactly solvable system . in section  [ new ]",
    "we construct new families of formally exactly solvable systems .",
    "application of the restriction on the behaviour of wave functions at boundaries leads to the conclusion that the systems are quasi - exactly solvable even if the wave functions are normalizable .",
    "discussion of results is presented in section  [ end ] .",
    "from the general viewpoint an operator is quasi - exactly solvable if it has a finite - dimensional invariant subspace .",
    "bearing in mind applications to the quantum mechanics we are interested in second order differential operators , hamiltonians .",
    "the most famous method of constructing quasi - exactly solvable differential operators is the lie - algebraic approach @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly discuss of main ideas of the approach .",
    "the one - dimensional and multidimensional cases have to be treated separately .",
    "the one - dimensional case is the most elaborated one .",
    "the simplest finite - dimensional subspaces are spaces which admit the following monomial basis : @xmath0 for such spaces it is not difficult to find invariant ( quasi - exactly solvable ) differential operators of the first order : @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "these operators form finite - dimensional representations of the algebra @xmath3 for @xmath4 . any second order operator taken as quadratic combination of the first order operators ,",
    "@xmath5 is automatically quasi - exactly solvable this question was completely investigated in ref .",
    "@xmath6 is a polynomial of order 4 . in the one - dimensional case",
    "any second order operator can be reduced to the schrdinger form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a wave function of the hamiltonian in the canonical form .",
    "this is essential difference of the one - dimensional case from multidimensional systems .",
    "the complete classification of linear differential operators with invariant subspaces of monomials is given in ref .",
    "( more recent discussions see in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in multidimensional case",
    "the situation is much more complicated @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the idea is the same .",
    "we construct finite - dimensional representation of some lie algebra in terms of first order differential operators @xcite , then one can look for hamiltonians considering quadratic combinations of the first order operators : @xmath9 with @xmath10 where @xmath11 and `` @xmath12 '' stand for the covariant derivative corresponding to the metric @xmath13 and such a hamiltonian can be reduced to the schrdinger form only if the self - consistency conditions are satisfied : @xmath14 from another point of view these equations are the necessary condition for the hamiltonian to be hermitian .",
    "the general solution of the constraints is unknown !",
    "therefore in the multidimensional case the general classification of quasi - exactly solvable linear differential operators is unknown even for invariant subspaces of monomials .",
    "however as it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite the problem with resolving the constraints can be avoided if one passes from @xmath15- to @xmath16-dimensional system .",
    "details of the procedure can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . nevertheless here",
    "we do not adopt this standpoint .",
    "when constructing quasi - exactly solvable operators in the lie - algebraic approach very often resulting systems live in domains with boundaries . if so one has to take into account behaviour of wave functions at the boundaries in addition to their normalizability .",
    "generally the system must evolve in a domain with a positively defined metrics @xmath17 here we investigate situation when components of the inverse metric @xmath18 are polynomial .",
    "therefore it is more convenient to define the boundaries of the domain as roots of the inverse metric determinant : @xmath19 to provide hermicity of the corresponding hamiltonian the following conditions have to be implied : @xmath20 for any @xmath21 and @xmath22 from the domain of the hamiltonian .    in the two - dimensional case",
    "the boundary can be locally given by the equation @xmath23 .",
    "then from the conditions one can infer that the wave functions from the domain of the hamiltonian have the following behaviour at the boundary : @xmath24 the normalizability of such a wave function leads to the inequality @xmath25 .",
    "so the hermicity implies the more strict inequality but often it is not taken into account .",
    "for example , consider the following hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath26 it can be represented in terms of generators of the algebra @xmath27 . in this case",
    "the inverse metric is @xmath28 its determinant has the form @xmath29 therefore we can consider the system in the domain @xmath30 . in principle",
    "there are four domains with positively defined metric but the consequence is the same for all of them .",
    "the wave functions corresponding to the quasi - exactly solvable sector have the structure @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a polynomial in @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "one can see that such functions are normalizable in the domain @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "however functions of such a form do not belong to the domain of the hamiltonian since they have improper behaviour at the boundaries .",
    "therefore , actually the hamiltonian is not quasi - exactly solvable .",
    "nevertheless it can be of interest in the context of pseudo - hermitian hamiltonians @xcite ( also see the discussion below ) .",
    "exactly solvable systems form a subset of quasi - exactly solvable systems , because evidently they have ( an infinite flag of ) finite - dimensional invariant subspaces .",
    "let us start discuss of this point in the context of the lie - algebraic approach from the one - dimensional case , .",
    "one can select two exactly solvable operators of the first order , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "a hamiltonian constructed in terms of these operators has the following general form : @xmath39 the resulting hamiltonian is exactly - solvable , but only formally . to proof the exact solvability one has to check normalizability of corresponding wave functions .",
    "not all systems given by the hamiltonian are exactly solvable in this sense .",
    "now we pass to the two - dimensional case .",
    "the following first order operators @xmath40 where @xmath41 , are exactly solvable because they are invariant on the spaces @xmath42 for any @xmath4 . for any fixed @xmath43 it is possible introduce yet another operator @xmath44 which is quasi - exactly solvable .",
    "all these operators form a series of representations of the algebra @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the case @xmath46 has to be considered separately since in this case there exist additional quasi - exactly solvable operators of the first order , e.g. see ref  @xcite .",
    "the general form of the hamiltonian constructed in terms of the first order operators is @xmath47\\label{h2}\\\\[-3mm]\\notag      & + \\bigl(q_0x + q_m(y)\\bigr)\\pd_x + q_1(y)\\pd_y,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are polynomials of degree @xmath51 and @xmath52 with real coefficients .",
    "the hamiltonian does not depend on the integer parameter @xmath43 and , as a consequence , has an infinite flag of finite - dimensional invariant subspaces parametrized by @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , formally it is an exactly solvable operator @xcite .    from the expression",
    "we infer the form of the inverse metric : @xmath53    in general the system given by the hamiltonian is too complicated to resolve the constraints . for simplicity",
    "we investigate the cases of factorizable and unfactorizable metric determinants : @xmath54 to this end we have to fix the coefficient functions , e.g. : @xmath55 for the fist case and @xmath56 for the second case .",
    "the functions @xmath57 are polynomials of degrees no more then @xmath58 .    by shifting and rescaling the variable @xmath34 we can fix the form of the linear function @xmath59 .",
    "there are two different cases .",
    "let us discuss the first one : @xmath60 in this case there are several solutions of equations with factorizable and unfactorizable metric determinants .",
    "for all of the solutions the coefficient functions @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are given by @xmath64&\\label{coef1}\\\\[-3 mm ] &        + \\left(p_0-q_0+\\frac{q_1}{p_2}-1\\right )         \\bigl(\\xi _",

    "but it is easy to check that for any choice of the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 the wave functions are not normalizable .",
    "therefore the system is actually not quasi - exactly solvable .    in the regions @xmath83 and @xmath84 the wave functions do not belong to the domain of the hamiltonian . to consider these domains it is necessary to discard the hermicity of the hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless in the quasi - exactly solvable sector matrix elements are real hence corresponding eigenvalues are real or form complex conjugated pairs . but",
    "this pattern is specific to pseudo - hermitian hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "therefore the system in the domains @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be interesting from this point of view . moreover",
    "some choice of the parameter @xmath85 can provide power - like falloff and normalizability of the wave functions ( at least part of them ) . in this sense",
    "the system is quasi - exactly solvable . besides",
    "if we discard the hermicity then it is possible to consider another configurations of boundaries when the corresponding system is quasi - exactly solvable or even exactly solvable .",
    "such a configuration is represented on the right plot of the figure  . indeed in this case",
    "the system living the finite region @xmath86 is exactly solvable because wave functions are normalizable for any values of the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath87 .",
    "according to the second solution @xmath88 and the wave functions have the following structure @xmath89 where @xmath67 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 the determinant of the inverse metric is factorizable @xmath92 possible configuration of boundaries in this system is schematically represented on the central plot of the figure  [ pic1 ] . from the structure of the wave functions",
    "one can conclude that for some choice of the parameters the wave functions are normalizable with power - like falloff and the system is quasi - exactly solvable in any of the domains .    according to the third solution the polynomials @xmath57 and @xmath93",

    "nevertheless if one discards the hermicity of the hamiltonian then for the situation represented on the right plot of figure  [ pic1 ] the system can be quasi - exactly solvable ( in the regions @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) or even exactly solvable ( in the region @xmath86 ) for some choice of the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "now we pass to the metric with the unfactorizable determinant , i.e. it has no roots in the variable @xmath33 . in this case",
    "there is the following nontrivial solution : @xmath98 and the wave functions have the following structure @xmath99 where @xmath67 , @xmath90 and @xmath100 the determinant of inverse metric has the form @xmath101 the determinant vanishes only at the line @xmath102 , therefore the system can live on the left or right semiplane of @xmath103 .",
