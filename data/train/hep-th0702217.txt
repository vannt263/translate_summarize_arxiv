    "various approaches to quantum gravity indicate that the effective field theory which emerges below the cutoff scale will be non - commutative .",
    "for example , in the context of string theory , one of the reasons for non - commutativity is that the basic objects which underlie the quantum theory are strings rather than point particles .",
    "a concrete formulation of this non - commutativity comes from the `` stringy space - time uncertainty relation '' of @xcite . in the matrix theory approach to non - perturbative string theory ,",
    "spatial coordinates arise in a certain limit from matrices which are non - commuting @xcite . this leads to space - space non - commutativity .",
    "the most promising arena to probe the fundamental non - commutativity of space - time on microscopic scales is cosmology .",
    "the reason is that , according to our present understanding , the seeds for the currently observed structure of the universe on large scales were laid down in the very early universe when the length scales which we probe today in cosmology were microscopic and thus subject to the modifications in the dynamics which arise due to the non - commutativity .",
    "the inflationary universe scenario is the current paradigm for early universe cosmology @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . according to this scenario , the universe experiences a period of accelerated expansion in its early stages . often , the expansion is close to exponential , or it is described by the scale factor @xmath0 expanding as a large power @xmath1 of time t. this accelerated expansion leads to the possibility of a causal structure formation scenario , as first discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1 provides a space - time sketch illustrating the basic idea . during the period of acceleration ,",
    "fixed comoving scales are stretched beyond the hubble radius @xmath2 .",
    "fluctuations on these scales can become the seeds for the presently observed large - scale structure and the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background .    by the same argument , however , we can argue @xcite that fluctuations on currently observed scales had a wavelength during the early stages of inflation which was so small that effects of planck - scale physics will be operative and leave an imprint on the initial evolution of the fluctuations , effects which are preserved until late times by the linear evolution of the fluctuations . initial studies of effects of trans - planckian physics on current observations in the context of inflationary cosmology made use of ad hoc modified dispersion relations for the fluctuation modes @xcite .",
    "these initial studies were followed by specific investigations of the effects of space - space @xcite and space - time @xcite non - commutativity .",
    "all of the works referenced in this paragraph were based on the current models of inflation in which it is assumed that inflation is driven by the potential energy of a scalar matter field . in this context ,",
    "any pre - existing classical fluctuations at the beginning of the phase of inflation are red - shifted , leaving behind a quantum vacuum .",
    "hence , it was postulated that the currently observed fluctuations are the result of the non - trivial evolution of quantum vacuum perturbations ( see e.g. @xcite for a comprehensive review of the theory of cosmological perturbations , and @xcite for a pedagogical introduction ) .",
    "non - commutativity of space - time or space - space leads to deformed dispersion relations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "whereas space - space non - commutativity introduces anisotropy into the dispersion relations , space - time non - commutativity leads to dispersion relations which preserve isotropy . in @xcite a class of deformed dispersion relation for ordinary radiation resulting from space - time non",
    "- commutativity was studied .",
    "this dispersion relation has a maximal momentum , and it has two branches ( two values of frequency for fixed momentum ) . in @xcite",
    "it was pointed out that this dispersion relation makes it possible to obtain a period of inflation driven by non - commutative radiation .",
    "typically , one obtains power - law inflation , inflation driven by the radiation itself . in @xcite , an order of magnitude estimate of the amplitude of the resulting cosmological fluctuations",
    "was given .",
    "in this paper , we present a detailed study of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in this model of non - commutative inflation .",
    "in contrast to the conventional models of inflation where the fluctuations are of quantum vacuum origin , in our model they are due to thermal fluctuations . in this aspect , our model has analogies with the `` warm inflation '' scenario @xcite in which the fluctuations are also of thermal origin .",
    "the following section provides a brief review of the non - commutative inflation scenario of @xcite .",
    "section 3 gives a summary of the key equations which describe the evolution of cosmological fluctuations which we will make use of . in section 4 ,",
    "we present the computation of the spectrum of scalar metric perturbations , based on thermal initial values for the fluctuations .",

    "note that the slopes of these two curves are different.,height=302 ]",
    "in the case of massless particles , the non - commutativity of space - time leads to modifications of the usual linear dispersion relation which take the form [ disprel1 ] e^2 - p^2 c^2 f(e)^2 = 0 with [ disprel2 ] f(e ) = 1 + ( e)^ . in the above , @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote momentum and energy , respectively , @xmath7 is a positive constant , and @xmath8 is a length scale whose physical meaning is the following : solving ( [ disprel2 ] ) for the momentum @xmath5 , we see immediately that for @xmath9 there is a maximal momentum @xmath10 whose value is determined by @xmath8 .",
    "for example , for @xmath11 the maximal momentum is @xmath12 .    for @xmath13 ,",
    "there are two values of the energy @xmath6 for any momentum - the dispersion relation has two branches . on the upper branch , the energy increases as the momentum decreases , which is what happens when the universe expands .",
    "it is this property which is crucial in order to realize that modified dispersion relations with @xmath13 can , at least for a certain range of values of @xmath7 , lead to inflation driven by ordinary radiation .",
    "the modification of the dispersion relation leads to a deformed thermal spectrum @xcite due to the changing density of states ( e ) = |1-| , where @xmath14 denotes the energy density ( per unit @xmath6 ) and @xmath15 is the inverse temperature .. ] in the high energy limit , @xmath16 .",

    "the friedmann and energy conservation equations are @xmath28 and its solutions are given for a constant equation of state parameter by @xmath29 these show power law inflation ( @xmath30 ) for values of @xmath7 in the range @xmath31 .",

    "inflation ends at time @xmath36 when there are no more excited states on the top branch of the dispersion relation .",
    "in this section we will list the key equations from the theory of cosmological perturbations which will be used .",

    "since there is no anisotropic stress , one degree of freedom for scalar metric fluctuations disappears and we can set @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "( [ pert_g00 ] ) and ( [ pert_gij ] ) can then be combined to give @xmath45 where we have used @xmath46 . as is well known",
    ", as long as the equation of state is not changing , then on scales larger than the sound horizon one of the solutions of the above equation tends to a constant , the other is decaying .",
    "thus , to know the power spectrum of @xmath39 at late times on scales larger than the sound horizon , it is sufficient to evaluate the amplitude of the @xmath47th mode of @xmath39 when the wavelength is equal to the sound horizon .",
    "introducing a variable @xmath48 ( in terms of which the action for cosmological perturbations has canonical kinetic term @xcite ) via [ vvar ] = 4g()^ , the equation of motion for scalar metric perturbations takes the simple form v^ + ( k^2 c_s^2 - ) v = 0 , [ mode_eq ] where z = .",

    "as it does at the end of the phase of inflation , @xmath39 is not constant .",
    "fortunately , for purely adiabatic perturbations there is a quantity which is conserved on scales larger than the sound horizon .",
    "this quantity is @xcite [ zetaeq ] + 2 3 ( h^-1 + ) . considering a transition between the period of radiation - driven inflation to the post - inflationary phase of regular radiation with @xmath51 , the conservation of @xmath52 implies [ factor1 ] _ f = ( 2 3 + 4 ) _",
    "i , where @xmath53 is the super - horizon value of @xmath39 during the initial period and @xmath54 is its final value during the radiation phase of standard cosmology .",
    "thus , the final spectrum of @xmath39 is related to the initial spectrum by a scale - independent multiplicative factor @xmath55 , which in the case of observationally viable backgrounds for which @xmath25 is close to @xmath56 is approximately [ factor2 ] f 4 .    in the following",
    "we will compute the spectrum of cosmological perturbations assuming that their origin is thermal . the correct variable to consider in this context",
    "is @xmath48 .",
    "the first justification is that it is this variable which enters the action for cosmological perturbations in the canonical way , and in terms of which concepts like particle number are well - defined .",
    "a second reason is that on sub - hubble scales , the variable @xmath48 for scalar field matter reduces to the matter field fluctuation ( multiplied by the scale factor ) .",
    "hence , the concept of `` number of quanta of @xmath48 '' reduces to the concept of the number of field fluctuation quanta .",

    "we will assume that the evolution equation for @xmath48 is not modified by the underlying space - time non - commutativity .",
    "this is well justified provided that the wavelengths we are interested in are much larger than the minimal length @xmath8 . on scales larger than the hubble radius",
    "this is always the case .",
    "if we consider temperatures @xmath59 smaller than @xmath60 , then we are safe for both sets of initial conditions we consider ( see below ) .",
    "the key question which has to be addressed is on what scale the initial conditions should be imposed . on a fixed comoving scale",
    ", it should be the time after which that scale ceases to be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "there are two possibilities : the hubble scale ( beyond which causality prohibits local causal interactions @xcite ) or else the thermal correlation length @xmath61 . in the following",
    ", we will adopt the latter prescription .",
    "this means that for a fixed scale @xmath47 , we will fix the fluctuations of the canonical variable @xmath48 to have a thermal equilibrium number at the time @xmath62 given by t^-1(_i(k ) ) = a(_i(k ) ) / k .",
    "the starting point of the analysis is the quantization of the linear cosmological perturbation variable @xmath48 .",
    "this variable is expanded into creation and annihilation operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the standard way .",

    "the amplitude of the power spectrum then becomes p_(k ) ~ f where we have used @xmath100 .",
    "note that the amplitude obtained with this prescription for setting initial conditions is larger than what was obtained using the previous recipe , the reason being that in order to maintain thermal equilibrium number of modes while the physical momentum is decreasing , the mode occupation number needs to decrease via interactions .",

    "the dispersion relation has two branches , i.e. two values of the frequency for every wavenumber .",
    "the upper branch of the dispersion relation has increasing frequency as @xmath47 decreases , this being the key property which leads to inflation . in the context of this model of inflation , the cosmological fluctuations are of thermal origin",

    "we discuss two prescriptions for setting up initial conditions . in the first",
    ", we set up the cosmological fluctuations mode by mode with thermal occupation numbers at the times when the modes exit the hubble radius . in the second prescription",
    ", the modes are initialized with thermal occupation numbers at the times when their wavelengths equal the thermal correlation length .",
    "we believe that this second prescription is the more realistic one , since on scales larger than the thermal correlation length the interactions are not likely able to maintain thermal occupation numbers .",
    "both prescriptions for initial conditions lead to a spectrum of fluctuations which is scale - invariant in the limit in which the expansion of space becomes exponential . for nearly exponential expansion",
    "the spectrum has a slight red tilt .",
    "we have computed the amount of the red tilt . for the choice of initial conditions which we believe are realistic in the context of model of inflation , the tilt has a different numerical value compared to the result for vacuum initial conditions in a scalar field - driven commutative inflation model with the same expansion rate .",
    "the amplitude of the spectrum is different from what is obtained in regular inflation models with the same background expansion history .",
    "our model is not the first inflationary model in which thermal rather than quantum vacuum initial conditions are the source of the inhomogeneities .",
    "the warm inflation @xcite scenario also has dominant thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , in warm inflation the acceleration of the background is generated by a commutative scalar field rather than by non - commutative radiation .",
    "thermal rather than vacuum fluctuations also play a crucial role in the recently discovered string gas structure formation scenario @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the fluctuations are of string thermodynamic origin rather than given by point particle thermodynamics .",
    "the possibility of thermal fluctuations as the source of an almost scale - invariant spectrum has also been studied in @xcite . however , in that work a regular dispersion relation for radiation was assumed . hence , no accelerated expansion resulted , and it was not possible to generate a nearly scale - invariant spectrum in a cosmological background in which the universe was always expanding .",
    "our work yields a confirmation of the fact that in inflationary cosmology , the accelerated expansion of space makes it possible to probe planck - scale physics in current observations via the induced signals in the spectrum of cosmological perturbations .",

    "<S> we compute the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in a scenario in which inflation is driven by radiation in a non - commutative space - time . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the non - commutativity of space and time leads to a modified dispersion relation for radiation with two branches , which allows for inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the initial conditions for the cosmological fluctuations are thermal . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be contrasted with the situation in models of inflation in which the accelerated expansion of space is driven by the potential energy of a scalar field , and in which the fluctuations are of quantum vacuum type . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in the limit that the expansion of space is almost exponential , the spectrum of fluctuations is scale - invariant with a slight red tilt . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the tilt is different from what is obtained in a usual inflationary model with the same expansion rate during the period of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude also differs , and can easily be adjusted to agree with observations . </S>"
