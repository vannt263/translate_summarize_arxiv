    "over the last decades considerable effort has been devoted to the investigation of simple nonequilibrium models of interacting particles .",
    "in addition to their application to specific problems ( traffic flow , ionic conductors , epidemics , etc . ) , such studies have been motivated by the hope of developing a macroscopic description of far - from - equilibrium systems .",
    "driven lattice gases , also known as _ driven diffusive systems _ ( dds ) @xcite , have played an important role in this program . in these models ,",
    "a stochastic lattice gas is subject to a  drive \" that biases hopping along one of the principal axes of the lattice @xcite .",
    "the repulsive version @xcite serves as a model for fast ionic conductors @xcite .",
    "stationary properties of driven lattice gases depend strongly on the details of dynamics , unlike in equilibrium .",
    "dds have provided a wealth of unexpected and counterintuitive results , many of which remain to be fully explained @xcite .",
    "( for example : the fact that the critical temperature of the attractive lattice gas _ increases _ under driving . )",
    "recently , a study of a two - dimensional lattice gas with nearest - neighbor exclusion ( nne ) , subject to a nonuniform ( shear - like ) drive , revealed a tendency for particles to migrate to the region with weaker drive @xcite ; the accumulation of particles is sufficiently strong to provoke sublattice ordering in this region . at higher densities",
    "the trend reverses , with particles accumulating in jammed regions that form where the drive is strongest . to better understand these results , we consider , in the present work , a one - dimensional ( ladder ) analog of the model studied in ref .",
    "the reduced dimensionality permits us to obtain simulation results of high precision , to develop high - order cluster approximations , and to derive essentially exact results ( for smaller systems ) , via numerical solution of the master equation .",
    "we find that particles migrate preferentially to the undriven lane at low densities , and to the driven one at higher densities .",
    "the same tendencies are observed in simulations of a continuous - space model .    in our model , one ring corresponds , in isolation , to a totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) with sequential dynamics , while the other is a symmetric exclusion process .",
    "( note however that the most widely studied version of the tasep features on - site exclusion only . )",
    "both models are exactly soluble and possess a stationary probability distribution that is uniform on the set of allowed configurations .",
    "the interaction between particles on different rings and the possibility of jumping between them changes this situation : the stationary probability distribution is no longer uniform , and the model exhibits nontrivial behavior .",
    "( the ladder without driving in either lane again corresponds to a simple equilibrium model that can be solved exactly via the transfer - matrix technique . )",
    "the tasep has attracted much attention due to the phase transitions that arise when , instead of periodic boundaries , the end sites are coupled to particle reservoirs @xcite . although not directly to the system studied here , it is worth noting that quite surprising phase behavior is found in an interacting tasep ladder , when the two lanes are coupled to different reservoirs @xcite , or there are asymmetric transition rates between them @xcite .",
    "a single - lane tasep with repulsive nearest - neighbor interactions exhibits a surprisingly complex phase diagram @xcite .",
    "our focus in this paper is on stationary properties , specifically , the particle density in the two lanes , the current , and the two - point correlation function .",
    "we also examine the stationary probability distribution ( for the lattice model ) on configuration space , and show that this distribution does not admit a simple characterization in terms of a set of macroscopic variables . the two - point correlation function @xmath0 exhibits power - law decay in both the lattice and continuous - space models .",
    "algebraic decay of correlations is well established in dds @xcite , and is expected to be a generic feature of anisotropic nonequilibrium systems with a conserved density @xcite , but is not commonly observed in periodic , one - dimensional systems .",
    "the balance of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",

    "the position of particle @xmath1 is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the _ lane_. in the lattice gas model , @xmath4 ; in the off - lattice model @xmath5 $ ] . in both cases , there are periodic boundaries in the @xmath6 direction . interactions between particles are purely repulsive : in the lattice gas model , the minimum allowed distance between particles in the same lane is 2 , while for particles in different lanes , the minimum allowed separation is 1 .",
    "( note that the nne condition means there is no particle - hole syttetry . )    in the _ off - lattice model _ the minimum distance between particles in the same lane is 1 , while the minimum separation along @xmath6 , for particles in different lanes is @xmath7 .",
    "the maximum density is 1 in this case . in both the lattice gas and continuous - space models ,",
    "the excluded volume constraint makes it impossible for particles to pass one another : the order of particles along the @xmath6 direction can not change .",
    "the process evolves via a sequential ( continuous - time ) markovian dynamics . in the lattice gas ,",
    "each particle in the driven lane ( @xmath8 ) attempts to hop forward by one lattice spacing [ @xmath9 at rate @xmath10 , and to hop to the other lane [ @xmath11 at rate @xmath12 .",
    "particles in the undriven lane ( @xmath13 ) attempt to hop to the upper lane at rate @xmath12 , and to hop forward or backward , each at rate @xmath14 .",
    "any attempted move that does not violate the excluded - volume constraint is accepted .",
    "the continuous - space model follows a similar dynamics .",
    "the rate of interlane driven transitions is again @xmath12 . in the driven lane , the intralane hopping rate is @xmath10 , with the displacement @xmath15 uniformly distributed on @xmath16 $ ] , so that particles in this lane can not jump in the @xmath17 direction .",
    "the hopping rate within the undriven lane is @xmath14 ; the displacement is uniformly distributed on @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "[ conf ] shows a typical region in the continuous - space model .",
    "the parameters characterizing the system are its size @xmath19 , particle number @xmath20 , and the transition rates @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14 .",
    "we expect that for large @xmath19 , macroscopic properties depend on the particle density @xmath21 instead of on @xmath20 and @xmath19 separately . in general ,",
    "stationary properties depend on the transition - rate ratios ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 , for example ) .",
    "the models ( on- or off - lattice ) with unbiased dynamics in both lanes represent _ equilibrium _ fluids with purely excluded volume interactions . in this case",
    "the stationary probability distribution is uniform on the set of allowed configurations .",
    "the nne lattice gas with both lanes driven also possesses a uniform stationary distribution , provided any absorbing configurations ( see below ) are excluded from consideration .",
    "( to show this one verifies that the number of configurations accessible from a given configuration @xmath24 equals the number of configurations from which @xmath24 is accessible , and that each transition out of @xmath24 occurs at the same rate as the corresponding transition in .",
    "it is easy to verify that this symmetry no longer holds in the half - driven ladder . )",
    "the same holds for the half - driven ladder with on - site exclusion only",
    ". we should therefore expect these models to have a trivial behavior ( for example , exponentially decaying correlations ) .",
    "it is straightforward to write the master equation for the lattice gas model defined in the previous section , the only practical limitation coming from the rapid growth in the number of configurations and transitions with increasing system size . in both this and the following section we employ a base-3 notation in which the configuration @xmath25 in each column ( fixed @xmath6 ) is denoted by 0 , 1 or 2 , corresponding to both sites empty , lower site occupied , or upper site occupied , respectively .",
    "then a configuration on a ring of @xmath26 sites is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "allowed configurations are such that , if @xmath28 or 2 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , for @xmath31, ...",
    ",@xmath19 , with periodic boundaries .",
    "our analysis of the master equation involves three steps .",
    "first , we enumerate all allowed configurations of @xmath20 particles on a ladder of @xmath32 sites ; configurations that differ merely by a rotation are treated as equivalent .",
    "next , the set of all transitions and associated rates is generating by considering all possible particle movements in each configuration .",
    "finally , the stationary probability distribution is generated via the fast iterative method described in @xcite .",
    "( for an alternative approach to constructing the stationary distribution see @xcite . )    at higher densities , some of the allowed configurations are _ absorbing _ ; all particle motion is blocked .",
    "this is obviously the case for @xmath33 , which is of no interest here . for even @xmath19 ,",
    "however , absorbing configurations with @xmath34 are possible ; instances appear for @xmath20 as small as @xmath35 , if @xmath19 is a multiple of six .",
    "( in particular , all configurations with @xmath36 are absorbing for @xmath19 even . )",
    "it turns out that all absorbing configurations are isolated in the sense that there are no transitions into them from other configurations .",
    "we therefore eliminate such configurations from the state space .",
    "( in simulations the initial configuration is always chosen to be nonabsorbing . ) we have verified , for systems of up to 38 sites , that the process ( restricted , if necessary , to the nonabsorbing subspace ) is ergodic , i.e. , there is a sequence of transitions leading from a given configuration to any other .",
    "the stationary probability distribution @xmath37 is used to evaluate the particle and current densities in each lane , and the statistical entropy per site , @xmath38 .",
    "we report results for the case @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "[ sd1619r ] shows the fraction @xmath41 of particles in the nondriven lane ( @xmath13 ) for several system sizes . for densities less than about 0.3",
    ", there is an excess of particles in the undriven lane ; the excess appears for systems with three or more particles . for densities above 0.3 , the trend reverses , with an excess of particles appearing in the driven lane .",
    "away from the extremes of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the fraction @xmath44 appears to trace out a smooth , roughly sinusoidal curve .",
    "( note however that this curve is not symmetric about the line @xmath45 , nor about the line @xmath46 . )",
    "we verified that in the absence of driving , the stationary probability distribution is uniform on the set of allowed configurations .    in fig .",

    "as expected , the current in the driven lane first grows with @xmath50 ( due to increasing number of carriers ) , and then decays ( due to blocking of particle movement at higher densities ) ; the maximum occurs at a density near 0.16 . due to the no - passing condition",
    ", particles in the undriven lane must also , on average , move forward .",
    "the current in this lane grows more slowly , reaching a maximum near @xmath51 . at higher densities the currents in the two lanes are virtually identical , as movement in one implies a corresponding movement in the other .",
    "the  outlying \" points at high density in fig .",
    "[ sd1619j ] reflect an odd - even effect that occurs near maximum filling .",
    "it is easy to verify , for example , that an isolated hole ( @xmath36 ) is immobile for @xmath19 even , while for @xmath19 odd it has a stationary velocity of @xmath52 .",
    "surprisingly , when @xmath19 is odd , the current for two holes is slightly _ less _ than for just one hole .",
    "these  anomalies \" are also observed in simulations ( sec .",
    "as noted , in equilibrium all allowed configurations have the same probability , so that the entropy ( in units of boltzmann s constant ) is @xmath53 , with @xmath54 denoting the number of configurations of @xmath55 particles on a ladder of @xmath32 sites that satisfy the nne condition . under biased dynamics",
    "the stationary probability distribution is no longer uniform over the set of configurations , making the statistical entropy of the driven system smaller than in equilibrium . in fig .",
    "[ dels ] we plot the entropy difference per site , @xmath56 , versus @xmath50 .",
    "the entropy reduction appears to attain a maximum near @xmath57 .",
    "( for comparison we note that @xmath58 is maximum for @xmath59 , while the current in the driven lane is maximum for @xmath60 . ) under the nonequilibrium dynamics , curiously , configurations with a more or less even distribution between the lanes are favored .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ sdn198 ] , which shows the _ average _ probability over all configurations with exactly @xmath55 particles in the driven lane , for the case @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "( of course , configurations with @xmath63 are more numerous , but in equilibrium the average probability is the same for all @xmath55 . )",
    "the average probability is slightly higher for @xmath64 than for @xmath65 , consistent with the migration of particles to the undriven lane .",
    "note however that in the tails of the distribution ( @xmath55=0 , 1 compared with @xmath667 , 8) this tendency is reversed .",
    "a related question is whether the stationary probability distribution @xmath37 can be expressed in terms of a small set of variables .",
    "the ` natural ' set of variables characterizing the global state of the system would appear to be the current densities @xmath48 and @xmath49 and the density @xmath67 of particles in the driven lane .",
    "classifying configurations by the values of these three variables , however , we find large variations in @xmath37 within each class .",
    "( in fact , for classes with more than one element , the standard deviation of @xmath37 over the class is comparable to the mean stationary probability of the class . ) for example , in the case @xmath68 , @xmath69 , the most numerous class , with 1497 configurations , is that having @xmath70 , and total currents @xmath71 and @xmath72 . within this class the stationary probabilities vary over two orders of magnitude ( from @xmath73 to @xmath74 ) , and almost all are distinct .",
    "( there is just one pair of configurations that have the same probability . )",
    "we therefore conclude that unlike in equilibrium , the stationary probability distribution can not be written as a function of a reduced set of variables .",
    "numerical solution of the master equation , discussed in the previous section , furnishes essentially exact results for limited system sizes . in this section",
    "we apply a complementary approach that treats effectively infinite systems using dynamic cluster approximations @xcite .",
    "we work with clusters of @xmath75 sites (  @xmath55-column approximation \" ) . for a given cluster size , we enumerate all configurations and all possible transitions involving the movement of a particle into , out of , or within the cluster .",
    "next we consider the master equation for the probability distribution on this set of configurations . for certain transitions ,",
    "the contributions to the gain and loss terms in the master equation can be written exactly using the @xmath55-column probability distribution .",
    "in other cases , however , the probability of a larger configuration , involving @xmath76 or @xmath77 columns , is needed to evaluate the contribution .",

    "probabilities of ( @xmath91)-column clusters are similarly estimated as the product of three @xmath55-column probabilities divided by the product of two ( @xmath90)-column probabilities .",

    "relatively slow convergence , we limited this study to @xmath92 columns .",
    "the predictions of the cluster approximation are compared against simulation in the following section .    to close this section we comment on a subtlety arising in the definition of the initial probability distribution .",
    "valid @xmath55-column distributions must satisfy certain symmetry relations , due to the fact that , in general , the marginal distributions for @xmath93 columns can be written in several ways . consider the case @xmath94 , for which the possible configurations are 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 .",
    "in addition to normalization , the following constraints apply to the two - column probability distribution :    @xmath95    and @xmath96    for @xmath64 further constraints arise , for example : @xmath97 and @xmath98    since the total density @xmath50 is conserved by the equations of motion , it must be defined in the initial distribution : @xmath99 , where @xmath100 denotes the number of occupied sites in configuration @xmath101 . for small clusters it is possible to find a simple parametrization of the probability distribution that permits one to fix the density while satisfying the symmetry relations noted above .",

    "redistribution of particles is strongest when the hopping rate in the driven lane is considerably larger ( by a factor of ten or so ) than the rate in the undriven lane .",
    "the redistribution found here is qualitatively similar to that observed in the two - dimensional driven nne lattice gas with a linear drive profile @xcite , but here the effects are much weaker , and migration to the driven lane is not accompanied by jamming , as it is in the two - dimensional system .",
    "the density difference observed in the one - dimensional system is relatively small , on the order of 1% or less of the total density ; in the two - dimensional system this difference can reach 25% .",
    "it is possible that migration in the two - dimensional system represents an amplification of the effect observed here , as particles move progressively to regions with weaker drive .",
    "( on the other hand the drive gradient in the two - dimensional system is @xmath177 , that is , much weaker than in the ladder studied here . )",
    "independent of its connection with the two - dimensional case , the redistribution observed here is an interesting nonequilibrium effect in a simple driven system .",
    "the existence of distinct densities is not in itself surprising : since the dynamics in the two lanes are radically different , there is no reason for the associated particle densities to be equal .",
    "but this does not explain why particles migrate to the undriven lane at low density , and to the driven one at high density .",
    "the former effect can be understood noting the high probability of diagonal pairs of particles , with the particle to the left in the driven lane , and the effect such a pair has on a third particle .",
    "we have generated the stationary probability distribution on rings of up to 2@xmath17819 sites .",
    "the stationary particle and current densities are quite similar to those for larger systems ( obtained via monte carlo simulation ) .",
    "the results for the stationary probability distribution allow us to characterize the reduction in statistical entropy caused by the drive .",
    "they also lead to the conclusion that the stationary probability distribution can not be written in terms of a reduced set of variables . in general",
    ", each configuration has a distinct stationary probability .",
    "remarkably , the two - point correlation function , @xmath0 , decays as a power law at low densities .",
    "the decay exponent @xmath142 takes a value close to two in the lattice gas . in the off - lattice system , @xmath142 ,",
    "takes a value near or below unity at low densities , and increases continuously with density ; the exponent also varies as a function of the transition rates .",
    "the amplitude of the power - law is much larger in the off - lattice system . at higher densities",
    "@xmath0 exhibits the oscillatory structure familiar in dense fluids , with an envelope that decreases exponentially with distance .",
    "while algebraic decay of correlations is expected to be a generic feature of driven systems with conserved density @xcite , the existing analyses do not apply specifically to the system studied here , and do not predict an exponent that varies continuously as a function of the density .",
    "a precedent for algebraic decay of correlations in a periodic one - dimensional system may be found in directed percolation @xcite , and in the driven lattice gas studied by helbing et al . @xcite . in these examples , however , slow decay of correlations is a manifestation of a continuous phase transition .",
    "the system studied here shows now evidence of a phase transition ( the density remains uniform , and there is no hint of nonanalytic behavior in the current , for example ) , and so appears to possess only a disordered phase .",
    "indeed , algebraic decay of correlations is expected to occur in the _ high - temperature _ phase of driven systems @xcite .",
    "a natural question is why , at higher densities ( @xmath179 in the continuous - space model ) , correlations appear to decay exponentially .",
    "we suspect that @xmath0 continues to have possess a power - law tail , but that this feature is masked by the short - range oscillatory contribution , due to its much larger amplitude .",
    "verification of this conjecture will have to await more extensive simulations or theoretical analysis .",
    "several one - dimensional driven models have been solved exactly via the matrix - product method @xcite .",
    "while it is possible that the model studied here could be solved by this method , we note that it corresponds , in the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , to a model with @xmath180 states per site ( a site here corresponding to a column in our original description ) , with an ` internal transition ' between two of these states , and an interaction range of @xmath181 .",
    "thus the search for a set of matrices satisfying the appropriate algebra promises to be a complex task , which we defer to future work .",
    "the present study leaves several other questions open for future theoretical and numerical investigation .",
    "principal amongst these is an explanation of the algebraic decay of correlations , and a more precise determination of the exponent @xmath142 as a function of density and transition rates .",
    "study of higher - order correlations , and of time - dependent properties , would also be of interest .",
