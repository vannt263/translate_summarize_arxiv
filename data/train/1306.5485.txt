    "far - infrared fine - structure lines of abundant elements such as carbon , oxygen , nitrogen and sulphur either in their neutral or ionised state contribute significantly to the gas cooling of the interstellar medium ( ism , e.g. hollenbach & tielens 1999 ) .",
    "far - infrared lines of ionised atoms are useful probes of hii regions while the main cooling of the neutral ism is carried out by [ cii ] and [ oi ] ( e.g. malhotra et al . , 2001 ) . in molecular gas , cooling is due to [ ci ] and the carbon monoxide molecule co. as potential tracers of the gas cooling , submillimeter [ ci ] and co lines are expected to provide information on the gas heating rate , which is dominated by the incident fuv radiation , mainly due to massive and young stars .",

    "the molecular co transitions have been extensively studied from the ground .",
    "however , the diagnostic power of the co rotational transitions has not been fully exploited since only the lowest transitions are easily accessible with ground - based telescopes . in recent years",

    "2010 ) covering the 194 to 671 @xmath0 m regime .",
    "this spectral region is particularly important as it allow us to access a number of high - j co line transitions and consequently investigate the properties of the molecular gas . in particular , the current observations allow us to probe the peak of the co sled and enable modeling of the physical properties of the molecular ism .",
    "in addition the detection of the two ground state [ ci ] and [ nii ] lines allow us to investigate the conditions in the pdrs .",

    "the maximum likelihood value for the h@xmath10 density of the cold temperature component predicted by our model is , however , lower than those reported in the literature .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising given that the cold gas component is in fact expected to have a lower density and a higher m@xmath27 .",
    "the warm gas component however , has a higher n(h@xmath10 ) density , and a lower column density n@xmath28 . based on the the lowest j @xmath2co lines , meier et al ( 2000 , 2001 ) inferred gas temperatures of 1020  k and densities of @xmath1710@xmath29@xmath23 .",
    "it is thus likely that there are multiple components to the molecular gas .",
    "denser gas with n(h@xmath10 ) @xmath3010@xmath31 is also present in ic342 as traced through cs and hc@xmath26n lines ( aladro et al .",
    "this dense gas is unlikely to contribute dominantly to the observed co emission , instead it is found in the central core of the molecular clouds in ic342 where evidently ( e.g. martin et al . 2009 ) is it used to sustain high star formation efficiency .",
    "a number of mechanisms can heat the co molecular gas , including uv starlight in photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , x - ray heated gas ( possibly associated with the presence of an agn ) in x - ray dominated regions ( xdrs ) , mechanical heating ( e.g. turbulence dissipation ) , powerful shocks and heating by cosmic rays .",
    "the absence of a strong agn in ic342 together with the shape of the co sled can probably rule out xdrs as the origin of the warm co emission . in the case of xdr dominance",
    "the co sled becomes flat at higher - j co transitions ( e.g. mrk 231 , van der werf et al .",
    "2010 ) which is clearly not the case in ic342 .",
    "a cosmic - ray ionisation rate of @xmath95@xmath410@xmath32 s@xmath33 ( e.g. de jong , dalgarno and boland 1980 ) is sufficient to heat the gas to about @xmath910 k. for an n(h@xmath10 ) density of 6@xmath410@xmath34 @xmath23 , co column density of 3.16@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath23 and an excitation temperature of 35 k the cosmic - ray ionisation rate is @xmath17 10@xmath35 s@xmath33 which is about 20 times higher compared to the standard rate . as eckart et al .",
    "( 1990 ) argue this is unlikely to be the case , especially in the nuclear region of ic342 as it would require a very strong 5 ghz non thermal radio component which is not observed .",
    "therefore , although cosmic rays may contribute towards heating low temperature @xmath910 k gas it is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism of co heating .    recent@xmath18ongoing star - forming activity in ic342 ( e.g. meier & turner 2005 , boker et al .",
    "1997 ) has resulted in an increased number of ob stars and therefore , in a more intense uv radiation field in this galaxy .",
    "the uv radiation heats up the surfaces of the molecular clouds by means of photoelectric heating and heating through far - uv pumping of h@xmath10 ( e.g. tielens & hollenbach 1985 ) .",
    "pdrs form in the outer layer of the clouds which are responsible for co emission from warm@xmath18hot gas . using the grid of pdr models presented in kaufman et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2006 ) we investigate predictions for the various @xmath1co lines .",
    "the rest of this section deals with models of the @xmath1co lines although for simplicity we refer to them as co lines .",
    "the pdr models cover a wide range in h@xmath10 density ( 1010@xmath7 @xmath23 ) and g@xmath36 , the incident uv flux .",

    "the fuv flux is related to the fir flux via the relation fir flux=2@xmath4 fuv .",
    "we note , however , that in our investigations of the pdr models we do not seek to determine the parameters that best fit the observed line ratios . instead , in addition to the relative co line intensities , we use the physical conditions determined from our lvg modeling as priors for pdr models .",
    "in our search we do not only consider the ml ( or mean ) value , instead , we make use of our likelihood analysis and take into account a larger parameter grid ( see figure 5 ) .     and and density @xmath38 for the pdr models .",
    "the vertical red dotted lines indicate the range of values for @xmath38 predicted by the radex models while the horizontal lines indicate the range of g@xmath36 values required to match the observed co line ratios .",
    ", width=302 ]    with the above caveats in mind , we have used the online pdr toolbox program ( kaufman et al .",
    "2006 , pound & wolfire 2008 ) to investigate the range of pdr parameters that would best match our co line ratios .",
    "the pdr toolbox program calculates the best values of g@xmath36 and cloud density @xmath38 for a given set of spectral line intensities .",
    "a description of the pdr models used for these tools can be found in kaufman et al .",
    "for a given set of gas phase elemental abundances and grain properties , each model is described by a constant h nucleus density , n , and incident far - ultraviolet intensity g@xmath36 .",
    "the models solve for the equilibrium chemistry , thermal balance , and radiation transfer through a pdr layer .",
    "we used the line intensities quoted in table 1 supplemented by those from the literature .",
    "the fts lines have been measured assuming a fwhm of 19@xmath39 as discussed in section 2 .",
    "figure 8 shows line ratios for various co transitions . assuming the range of n(h@xmath10 ) values determined from the likelihood analysis ( 10@xmath2210@xmath40 @xmath23 ) g@xmath36 should be in the range10@xmath41g@xmath4210@xmath43 to match the observed co line ratios .",
    "in fact the best - fit pdr models predicts n(h@xmath10 ) = 5.62@xmath410@xmath22 @xmath23 and g@xmath36=3.16@xmath410@xmath43 .",
    "although at this stage a second mechanism ( e.g. cosmic ray heating of the coldest gas ) contributing to the co lines can not be excluded it is very likely that pdrs play an important , perhaps dominant , mechanism for the co emission we have detected .",
    "our measured line ratios can be matched with pdr models with n(h@xmath10 ) very close to the values found by the maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "based on the models presented we conclude that a significant fraction of the co emission in ic342 originates in pdrs .",
    "as discussed in section 2 ( and presented in table 1 ) we detect three fine structure lines , the two [ ci ] 370 and 608 @xmath0 m and [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m lines . prior to herschel only a handful of [ ci ] extragalactic measurements had been carried out from the ground .",
    "the [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m line emission , in particular , is very difficult to observe from the ground because it lies near the long - wavelength cutoff for stressed ga : ge photoconductors , strongly limiting the sensitivity of spectrometers in this regime .",

    "when expressed in line temperature units ( k km s@xmath33 ) the [ ci](j=2@xmath451)@xmath18[ci](j=1@xmath450 ) ratio for ic342 becomes 0.54 .",
    "for this observed line ratio , a brightness temperature of @xmath17 15 k and assuming a line width of 54 km s@xmath33 we estimate a column density n(c)=2.1@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 and h@xmath10 density of 5.4@xmath410@xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "these values are indicative of an excitation temperature 40@xmath46t@xmath21@xmath4660 k. the range of the inferred [ ci ] excitation temperature is slightly higher than the one derived from cold ( low - j ) co ( mean value of 36 k ) although well within the uncertainties involved .",
    "it is , thus likely that that [ ci ] may originate in the same ( cold ) molecular gas .",
    "the column density ratio n@xmath47n@xmath28 is 0.66 a value similar to that derived for m82 ( e.g. stutzki et al . 1997 ) but lower than the value of 1 reported for arp 220 by rangwala et al .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. wilson et al .",
    "1997 but see also discussion in rangwala et al . 2011 ) that [ ci ] emission is stronger for more luminous systems or those harboring intense starbursts or agn .",
    "israel ( 2005 ) examined the [ ci](2@xmath451)@xmath48 and [ ci](2@xmath451)@xmath49 line ratios for a sample of quiescent , starburst and active galaxies .",
    "he found that in the majority of galaxies the [ ci](2@xmath451)@xmath49 ratio is @xmath502 .",
    "lower ratios are expected in high - uv environments with high column densities where the majority of neutral c will be locked up in co. for ic342 the [ ci](2@xmath451)@xmath49 value of 1.2 ( israel 2005 ) is smaller than the values found for the majority of strong starbursts or luminous systems . the line ratio together with the derived c column density of 2.1@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 and the fact that [ ci ] is weaker than co emission in ic342 could be be indicative of [ ci ] arising in a thin layer on the outside of the co emitting molecular clouds consistent with pdrs playing an important role .",
    "the [ nii]205 @xmath0 m and [ cii]158 @xmath0 m lines have nearly identical critical densities for excitation in ionised gas regions .",
    "their line ratio is thus insensitive to the hardness of the stellar radiation field ( since the photon energies required to ionize each species to the next ionisation states are similar ) and is only a function of the [ nii]205/[cii ] abundance ratio .",
    "the ratio [ nii]@xmath18[cii ] can , thus , give us an estimate of the fraction of [ cii ] arising in ionised gas for a given value of the ionised gas density .",
    "the [ nii ] 122@xmath18205 @xmath0 m line ratio can be used to probe the density of the ionized gas .",
    "using [ cii ] and [ nii]122 @xmath0 m measurements of ic342 from the iso - lws archive ( but also in brauher et al .",

    "if both lines arise from the ionized gas the expected [ cii]@xmath18[nii ] 205 ratio would have been @xmath93 .",
    "given our estimate of 17@xmath242.5 we infer that the contributions from ionised gas to [ cii ] is 17 - 20% with the remaining originating in warm gas pdrs .",
    "this result lends further support to the suggestion that pdrs must play an important role in ic342 .",
    "the most widely used method to investigate the properties of the molecular gas of galaxies near and far , is through measurements of co transitions . for nearby galaxies , a suite of low - j co transitions",

    "the diagnostic tools to model the high - j co lines are still under development , however , we have already began to exploit the new information available . extremely high co line excitation implies the presence of an agn and strong heating by xdrs or shocks . in star forming regions pdrs play a crucial role by heating the dust efficiently .",
    "the co - sled of mrk 231 has been modelled as the result of contributions from pdrs and xdrs , the latter to account for the emission of the high - j lines ( van der werf et al .",
    "2010 ) . in lower luminosity agn signatures of xdr heating",
    "are present close to the nucleus on small scales while in the starburst regions co excitation originates in by pdrs ( e.g spinoglio et al .",
    "2012 ) . in starbursts , such as m82 , detailed analysis of the co - sled revealed that although pdrs could play a role they can not provide high enough densities to match the observed co line emission .",
    "kamenetsky et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have therefore concluded that mechanical energy ( turbulent motions , shocks , cosmic ray heating ) is likely to play a large role in the heating of the galaxy .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by rangwala et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for arp220 .    in the case of ic342",
    ", we have shown that the co - sled can be adequately explained with a combination of a cold ( t@xmath935 k ) , low density component to explain the low - j transitions ( with most contribution from j=1 - 0 ) and a warmer component ( t@xmath9400 k ) necessary to account for the high - j transitions .",
    "* there is convincing evidence that co excitation in this quiescent star - forming galaxy can be provided by pdrs without invoking a need for extra heating mechanisms .",
    "thus , ic342 may be used as a template for explaining the co - sled of high - redshift main - sequence galaxies * that do not appear to be merger - driven ( e.g. elbaz et al . 2011 ) .",
    "we have presented spectroscopic observations of ic342 covering the wavelength range 194 - 671 @xmath0 m carried out with the spire - fts on board herschel .",
    "we have detected a number of @xmath1co , @xmath2co molecular , [ ci ] atomic and [ nii ] ionic lines .",
    "we have used the radiative transfer code radex coupled with multinest to model the @xmath1co sled : the modeling procedure has revealed two gas components , a cold temperature component t@xmath935 k and , a much warmer component with t@xmath9400  k. our new spire - fts data and in particular the high - j @xmath1co lines have allowed us to constrain the physical properties of the warm gas component . based on the observed co line ratios and published models of pdrs we argue that the co emission originates in pdrs although additional contributions from e.g. cosmic ray heating can not be excluded . using the observed atomic [ ci ] line ratio",
    "we discuss the origin of the [ ci ] and suggest that it arises in a thin layer on the outside of the co emitting molecular clouds .",
    "this claim is further supported by the fact that the [ ci ] emission in ic342 is much weaker than the co(43 ) . using [ cii ] 158 @xmath0 m measurements from iso ( brauher et al .",
    "2008 ) and the [ nii ] 205 @xmath0measurement presented here we infer that up to 70% of [ cii ] arises in warm pdrs on the surface of molecular gas clouds .",
    "such detailed studies of the properties of the atomic , molecular and ionised gas in nearby galaxies have only recently become available thanks to the capabilities of herschel .",

    "<S> we present observations of the nearby spiral galaxy ic342 with the herschel spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ) fourier transform spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral range afforded by spire , 196 - 671 @xmath0 m , allows us to access a number of @xmath1co lines from j=43 to j=1312 with the highest j transitions observed for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we present measurements of @xmath2co , [ ci ] and [ nii ] . </S>",
    "<S> we use a radiative transfer code coupled with bayesian likelihood analysis to model and constrain the temperature , density and column density of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> we find two @xmath3 components , one at 35 k and one at 400 k with co column densities of 6.3@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 and 0.4@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 and co gas masses of 1.26@xmath410@xmath7 m@xmath8 and 0.15@xmath410@xmath7 m@xmath8 , for the cold and warm components , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the high - j @xmath1co line observations , indicate the existence of a much warmer gas component ( @xmath9400 k ) confirming earlier findings from h@xmath10 rotational line analysis from iso and spitzer . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the warm gas is 10% of the cold gas , but it likely dominates the co luminosity . in addition , we detect strong emission from [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m and the @xmath11 and @xmath12 [ ci ] lines at 370 and 608 @xmath0 m , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath1co line ratios can be explained by photon - dominated region ( pdr ) models although additional heating by e.g. cosmic rays can not be excluded </S>",
    "<S> . the measured [ ci ] line ratio together with the derived [ c ] column density of 2.1@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 and the fact that [ ci ] is weaker than co emission in ic342 suggests that [ ci ] likely arises in a thin layer on the outside of the co emitting molecular clouds consistent with pdrs playing an important role .
