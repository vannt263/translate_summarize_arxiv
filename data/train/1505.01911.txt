    "in the quantum weak measurements introduced by aharanov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , when the coupling strength between the measuring device and the quantum systems is very weak , the values of the meter s readings could be much larger than those obtained in the traditional quantum measurement .",
    "because of such amplification effect , the weak measurement strategies have been used to implement a lot of high - precise measurements , such as observing the tiny spin hall effect of light  @xcite , and amplifying small transverse deflections and frequency changes of optical beams  @xcite . besides the advantages in measuring small signals , weak measurements are very useful for exploring the fundamental problems of quantum mechanics  @xcite . since its importance in applications and fundamental theories ,",
    "weak measurement has attracted much attention  @xcite .    for the random errors which can be reduced by repeated measurements  @xcite ,",
    "there is also an open question whether the weak measurements can improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) significantly compared with the ordinary measurements  @xcite .",
    "but for the system errors which can not be reduced by repeated measurements  @xcite , the amplification effect of weak measurements can effectively reduce the relative system errors .",
    "this is the reason why a lot of super - precise measurements are accomplished with the methods of weak measurement . from the results in the literature  @xcite ,",
    "it is concluded that when the coupling strength is weak , and the measure device state is the typical gaussian wave function , the maximal shifts of the pointer momentum and position are are respectively equal to @xmath0 ( the standard deviation of the momentum of the pointer initial state ) and @xmath1 ( the standard deviation of the position of the pointer initial state ) which are independent with the coupling strength @xmath2 .    for the fixed measure device and coupling strength ,",
    "the maximal shifts of the pointer are obtained by choosing nearly orthogonal preselection and postselection states ( pps ) .",
    "compared with classical states , quantum states are much more sensitive to the disturbance of the outside environment .",
    "if the quantum states suffers from some noise , could we obtain the significant amplification as we expected ? if not",
    ", what the amplification limit will be ? in this article , we will study these two questions . as the postselection states are realized by a sequential strong measurement after the weak interaction between the device and systems , and what we need",
    "are the outcomes .",
    "so we only study the maximum shifts of the pointers when the preselection states are disturbed by the noise from the outside environment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we will study the relationships between the modulus of the preseletion states and the amplification .",
    "the maximum pointer shifts are given under the quantum noise for the gaussian and qubit meters in sec .",
    "a short conclusion is presented in sec .",
    "in weak measurements , the quantum systems that to be measured are prepared in some state @xmath3 . during the storage and transmission processes ,",
    "the quantum systems are always correlated with the outside environment unavoidably . and the pure preslection state @xmath3 may change into a mixed state @xmath4 . in this article , it is assumed that the preselection state has been changed into a mixed state @xmath4 before entering measure device .",
    "the weak interaction between the quantum systems and measure device could be described by an impulse hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath2 is the coupling strength with @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the observable operator of the quantum systems , and @xmath8 is the observable operator of measure device .",
    "the measure device state is denoted by @xmath9 , after the interaction , the combined state of the system and the measure device state is @xmath10 where @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "different with ordinary measurements , weak measurements require a postselection to select the system into state @xmath13 .",
    "after the postselection , with the notation @xmath14 , the final measure device state is @xmath15 in weak measurements , the readings are the expectation values of the pointer conditioned on obtaining the postselectin state @xmath16 .",
    "if the observable operator of the pointer to be recorded is @xmath17 , the shift of @xmath17 is @xmath18 in order to search for the amplification effects , we should choose appropriate pps ( @xmath4 and @xmath19 ) to obtain the maximum value of @xmath20 .",
    "in quantum information , the most important and useful systems are qubits , and most of the weak value amplification experiments are based on qubits . in this article , the quantum systems to be measured are qubits . and two types of measure devices are used to analyze the amplification affected by the quantum noise .",
    "one is the continuous gaussian type and the other is the discrete qubit meter .",
