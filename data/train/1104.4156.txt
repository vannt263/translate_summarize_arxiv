    "a recent paper @xcite shows how to generalize @xmath0 quantum mechanics from the heisenberg algebra @xmath11=i$ ] to other kinds of algebras , such as e2 .",

    "@xcite are bosonic in character because they are expressed in terms of commutation relations .",
    "however , jones - smith and mathur have shown how to describe @xmath0-symmetric quantum theories in a fermionic setting @xcite .",
    "thus , in the current paper we apply the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to examine the representations of algebras expressed in terms of anticommutation relations .",
    "we consider here two standard algebras : the operator algebra of fermions , which consists of two nilpotent elements , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , whose anticommutator is unity , @xmath17 and the _ grassmann _ algebra , which again consists of two nilpotent elements , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , whose anticommutator vanishes , @xmath18 the requirement that @xmath15 and @xmath16 be nilpotent is imposed to incorporate fermionic statistics .",
    "our objective is to find matrix representations of ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) in the context of fermionic @xmath0-symmetric quantum mechanics ; that is , under the assumption that @xmath16 is the @xmath0 reflection of @xmath15 : @xmath19    in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] we investigate the two - dimensional matrix representations of ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) using nothing more than the representation of @xmath20 and @xmath21 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite in which the square of the @xmath21 operator is unity : @xmath1 . then in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , we apply the more elaborate formalism introduced recently in ref .",
    "@xcite in which is it argued that @xmath2 ( and not @xmath22 ) for fermions .",
    "we show that if we replace the condition @xmath1 by @xmath2 , it is still possible to find matrix representations of the grassmann algebra ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "however , the surprise is that it is not possible to find matrix representations of the fermion operator algebra in ( [ e1 ] ) ; one can only find matrix representations of the @xmath0 version of the fermionic operator algebra @xmath23",
    "for purposes of comparison , we begin by considering a two - dimensional matrix representation in which we assume that @xmath16 is given by the conventional hermitian adjoint @xmath24 . the most general complex matrix @xmath15",
    "whose square vanishes has vanishing trace and determinant , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are arbitrary complex numbers and @xmath28 is fixed by the determinant condition @xmath29 .",
    "then , @xmath16 is given by @xmath30 and the nilpotency condition @xmath4 is automatically satisfied .",
    "the fermionic algebra condition @xmath31 now reduces to @xmath32 thus , if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real , they are constrained to a unit diamond , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . more generally , if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are complex , then @xmath35 and @xmath36 are arbitrary and @xmath37 and @xmath38 lie on the line segment @xmath39 in the positive quadrant of the @xmath40 plane .     and @xmath27 for the representation of @xmath15 in ( [ e5 ] ) for the case in which @xmath16 is the conventional hermitian conjugate of @xmath15 ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 satisfy the fermionic algebra @xmath41",
    ". the diamond - shaped locus of points is described by the equation latexmath:[$|b|+     for the case of the grassmann algebra , @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfy the constraint @xmath43 instead of ( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "the unique solution to ( [ e8 ] ) is @xmath44 .",
    "thus , in this case there is no nontrivial grassmann representation for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "now let us turn to the case of a @xmath0-symmetric fermionic algebra . what happens if we apply to fermions the naive representations of parity reflection @xmath20 and time reversal @xmath21 that were used earlier in ref .",
    "we represent a parity reflection as a real symmetric matrix whose square is unity , which for two - dimensional matrices is @xmath45 and we represent @xmath21 as complex conjugation . with these choices , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48=0 $ ] .    here , if @xmath15 is as given in ( [ e5 ] ) , then from ( [ e3 ] ) @xmath16 is given by @xmath49 once again , the condition @xmath4 is automatically satisfied .",
    "now , requiring that @xmath15 and @xmath16 obey the fermionic algebra @xmath50 leads to the condition @xmath51 thus , if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real , they lie on the lines shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , which is the unbounded extended complement of the diamond shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . more generally , if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are complex , then @xmath35 and @xmath36 are arbitrary , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 lie on two infinite lines @xmath52 in the positive quadrant of the @xmath40 plane .     and",
    "@xmath27 for the representation of @xmath15 in ( [ e5 ] ) for the case in which @xmath16 is the @xmath0 conjugate of @xmath15 , where @xmath20 is given in ( [ e9 ] ) and @xmath21 is complex conjugation , @xmath15 and @xmath16 satisfy a fermionic algebra .",
    "the locus of points is described by the equation @xmath53 and is thus an unbounded region , in contrast with the bounded region shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . ]",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are required to satisfy a grassmann algebra , then if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real , they must satisfy the equation @xmath54 thus , unlike the hermitian case , there is a nontrivial set of solutions .",
    "it is interesting that when @xmath16 is the @xmath0 conjugate of @xmath15 , there is an unbounded range of parameters and that when @xmath16 is the hermitian conjugate of @xmath15 , the range of parameters is bounded .",
    "this result is strongly analogous to what was found in the study of the @xmath0-symmetric quantum brachistochrone compared with the conventional hermitian quantum brachistochrone @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian that describes the @xmath0 brachistochrone are unbounded ( even though the eigenvalues are fixed ) , while the matrix elements of the hamiltonian for the hermitian quantum brachistochrone are bounded .",
    "thus , @xmath0-symmetric quantum mechanics is hyperbolic ( unbounded ) in character , while conventional hermitian quantum mechanics is elliptic ( bounded ) in character .",
    "for a correct quantum - mechanical description of fermions , the time - reflection operator @xmath21 must be chosen such that its square is @xmath55 instead of @xmath22 @xcite . in a recent paper by jones - smith and mathur ,",
    "this fact is used to construct suitable matrix representations of the @xmath21 and @xmath20 operators @xcite . in the following subsection",
    "we briefly recapitulate their results .      in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown how to construct matrix representations of dimension @xmath56 @xmath57 of the @xmath21 and @xmath20 operators .",
    "the effect of a time operator acting on a state @xmath58 , which is a @xmath59-dimensional vector , is to take the complex conjugate of @xmath58 and to multiply the result by a real matrix @xmath60 : @xmath61 the general form for the @xmath60 matrix consists of @xmath62 copies of the @xmath63 matrix @xmath64 on the main diagonal and zero entries elsewhere . for the simplest ( @xmath65 ) case @xmath60",
    "is the @xmath66 matrix @xmath67 the effect of a parity operator acting on a state @xmath58 is to multiply @xmath58 by a real matrix @xmath68 : @xmath69 the general form for the @xmath68 matrix is the diagonal matrix whose first @xmath62 diagonal elements are @xmath70 and whose next @xmath62 diagonal elements are @xmath71 . for the simplest ( @xmath65 ) case @xmath68 is the @xmath66 matrix @xmath72 note that with these choices the operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 commute , @xmath73 , and @xmath2 .",
    "also , the matrices @xmath68 and @xmath60 satisfy @xmath74=0 $ ] , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "these results are nearly identical with those of bjorken and drell @xcite in their discussion of the operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the dirac equation . in this text",
    "it is shown that when the parity - reflection operator @xmath20 acts on a four - component spinor , it has the effect of multiplying the spinor by the matrix @xmath77 , which is precisely the matrix @xmath68 given in ( [ e16 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , when the time - reversal operator @xmath21 acts on a four - component spinor , it has the effect of multiplying the spinor by the matrix @xmath78 , which is the matrix @xmath79 , with @xmath60 given in ( [ e14 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath80 .",
    "it still follows that @xmath2 because @xmath81 is imaginary and thus it changes sign under complex conjugation .",
    "our next task is to construct general classes of quadratically nilpotent matrices .",
    "we know that an @xmath82-dimensional matrix whose square vanishes must have a vanishing trace and determinant . of course , if @xmath83 , not all traceless @xmath82-dimensional matrices having a vanishing determinant are quadratically nilpotent .",
    "thus , we propose the following very simple general set of such matrices : let the elements in the top row of the matrix be arbitrarily chosen complex numbers : @xmath84 .",
    "next , let the @xmath85th row ( @xmath86 ) be an arbitrary multiple @xmath87 of the elements in the first row .",
    "this matrix contains @xmath88 arbitrary complex parameters and by construction its determinant vanishes .",
    "we then impose the condition that the matrix be traceless : @xmath89 the resulting matrix contains @xmath90 complex parameters and is quadratically nilpotent . in four dimensions",
    "this construction gives the following general 12-parameter complex matrix representation for @xmath15 : @xmath91    using the matrix representation in ( [ e14 ] ) for the time - reversal operator and the matrix representation @xmath68 in ( [ e16 ] ) for the parity - reflection operator , we obtain from ( [ e3 ] ) the @xmath0 reflection of @xmath15 from the formula @xmath92 @xcite : @xmath93 one can verify that @xmath4 .      using the @xmath66 matrix representations for @xmath15 in ( [ e18 ] ) and @xmath16 in ( [ e19 ] ) , we can now construct the anticommutator @xmath94 .",
    "for the special case in which the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 are real , the matrix @xmath98 has a particularly simple form because the expression @xmath99 factors out of all 16 matrix elements :      thus , if we choose @xmath101 then all 16 matrix elements of @xmath98 vanish , and we have found a five - parameter four - dimensional real matrix representation of @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the grassmann algebra ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "there is no choice of parameters for which @xmath102 . to show that this is true , we see from ( [ e20 ] ) that @xmath103 requires that @xmath104 and that @xmath105 requires that @xmath106 . combining these two equations gives @xmath107",
    "thus , @xmath108 and also @xmath109 .",
    "it follows that @xmath110 and we conclude that it is impossible to construct a real matrix representation of @xmath15 that obeys the @xmath0-symmetric fermionic operator algebra ( [ e1 ] ) .    in general , the parameters in ( [ e18 ] ) and ( [ e19 ] ) are complex numbers : @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 . if we set the @xmath117 matrix element of the anticommutator matrix @xmath98 to @xmath118 , we obtain two equations for the vanishing of the real and imaginary part .",
    "these equations are long and complicated and they are quadratic in all of the parameters @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , except for two ; surprisingly , they are _ linear _ in @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "if we solve this pair of equations simultaneously , we obtain startlingly simple results for the real and imaginary parts of @xmath95 : @xmath126\\nonumber\\\\ & & /(a_2 ^ 2+a_1 ^ 2 + 1),\\nonumber\\\\ f_2&=&-[(a_2c_2+a_1c_1-b_1)h_2+(a_1c_2-a_2c_1+b_2)h_1\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( c_1+a_2b_2+a_1b_1)g_2+(-c_2+a_1b_2-a_2b_1)g_1]\\nonumber\\\\ & & /(a_2 ^",

    "thus , we have found a 10-parameter complex grassmann representation .",
    "an interesting special case is the complex _",
    "symmetric _ representation ( there is no real symmetric representation ) : @xmath127 for which @xmath35 is real .",
    "this representation has an obvious quaternionic structure .      to construct a fermionic algebra",

    "the expressions for the matrix elements of @xmath98 are extremely complicated , but ( [ e22 ] ) indicates a way to proceed .",
    "note that the denominator of ( [ e22 ] ) is quadratic in @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "this suggests that we should choose @xmath128 and @xmath129 so that we can obtain _ linear _ equations to solve for @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "we find that it is simplest to solve simultaneously the real and imaginary parts of @xmath130 for @xmath119 and @xmath120 and we obtain @xmath131 where      amazingly , it is not necessary to solve for any other parameters ; we find that when we substitute the values of @xmath119 and @xmath120 in ( [ e24 ] ) into the matrix @xmath98 we obtain after massive simplification a stunningly simple expression for @xmath98 : @xmath135 this result is a surprise because @xmath136 rather than the expected matrix @xmath137 .",
    "evidently , it is not possible to achieve the conventional fermionic algebra in ( [ e1 ] ) but rather we get the @xmath0-symmetric variant of this algebra in ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "indeed , we have found an eight - parameter representation of this algebra in which the real and imaginary parts of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 are arbitrary .",
    "note that we can not change the sign in this algebra from @xmath71 back to @xmath138 by multiplying @xmath15 by a complex phase because the time - reversal operator @xmath21 performs complex conjugation .",
    "we conclude that because the time operator for fermions obeys the equation @xmath2 , the fermionic operator algebra for a @xmath0-symmetric system necessarily picks up an extra minus sign ; we must replace the algebra in ( [ e1 ] ) by its @xmath0 variant in ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "we interpret the negative sign in the fermionic algebra ( [ e4 ] ) as indicating a fundamental change in character from elliptic to hyperbolic .",
