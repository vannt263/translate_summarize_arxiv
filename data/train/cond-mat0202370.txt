    "the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) as implemented on the basis of multiple scattering theory @xcite and combined with density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite constitutes the basis for _ ab inito _ calculations of the electronic structure and physical properties of random metallic alloys .",
    "this combination of the cpa with dft , or , in most cases , with the local density approximation ( lda ) , seems to be quite transparent @xcite leading to expressions for the one - electron potential and total energy which are very similar to those for ordered systems . however , there is , by now , a well - recognized problem @xcite with this description caused by the fact that the atomic or `` muffin - tin '' spheres , which _ artificially _ divide the crystal into regions associated with particular alloy components , may poses non - zero net charges .",
    "the problem stems from the fact that the conventional single - site ( ss ) dft - cpa method is based on the effective medium model of a random alloy which considers only conditionally averaged quantities and leads to the use of the single - site approximation not only in the electronic structure part of the problem during the solution of the cpa equations , but also in the dft self - consistent loop in the calculations of the electrostatic contributions to the one - electron potential and energy .",
    "the single - site approximation provides no information as to the charge distribution beyond the atomic sphere of each alloy component and , since the surrounding effective medium is electroneutral , poisson s equation can not be solved properly if the atomic spheres have non - zero net charges .",
    "hence , to find the correct solution to poisson s equation one must somehow describe the effect of the missing charge .",
    "since the electron density inside each atomic sphere is well - defined , any such description may be associated with a modification of the effective medium specifically for _ each _ alloy component .",
    "this may be regarded as an inconsistency since , in that case , the cpa and the electrostatic part of the dft are based on different effective media .    one obvious solution to the problem is to use electroneutral spheres ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "however , in the methods based on the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) this frequently leads to large sphere overlaps and a quite poor description of the electronic structure , especially in the case of inhomogeneous system , such as partially ordered alloys or surfaces with an inhomogeneous concentration profile .",
    "a more general solution can be found , however , in which the electrostatic potential is modified without making effective media for each alloy component in contradiction to the assumptions of the cpa .",
    "the way to do this is to introduce an additional shift of the one - electron potential due to the electrostatic interaction of the electrons inside each atomic sphere with the missing charge distributed outside of the sphere and postulate that the interaction comes from the boundary between the atomic sphere and the effective medium .",
    "such a shift may be associated with an _ intrasite _ interaction , which has no connection , at all , to the effective medium .",
    "this is exactly what is done in the locally self - consistent green s function method @xcite where one goes beyond the single - site approximation for poisson s equation by means of a supercell which models the spatial distribution of the atoms in a random alloy while a cpa effective medium is used in the electronic structure calculations beyond a local interaction zone ( liz ) .",
    "if the liz consists of only one atom , the lsgf method becomes equivalent to the cpa method with a properly defined electrostatic potential and energy @xcite . in this case",
    ", however , each atom in the supercell has its own electrostatic shift given by the madelung potential from all the other atoms in the supercell while the effective medium is the same for all atoms .",
    "it is clear that such an additional shift for each alloy component does not interfere with the cpa because the cpa effective medium is determined on the basis of the one - electron potentials including these shifts and because the cpa itself does not impose any restriction on the one - electron potentials of the alloy components .    following the above arguments two groups have proposed an _",
    "ad hoc _ expression for the electrostatic shift of the one - electron potential due to non - zero net charges in the atomic spheres of the alloy @xcite .",
    "although the basic models are seemingly different and based on different observations , either i ) , the net charge of an impurity in a metal is screened beyond the first coordination shell @xcite or ii ) , the net charge of an alloy component is proportional to the number of the nearest neighbors of the opposite type @xcite , they lead to exactly the same expression for the one - electron potential , i.e. ,    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the additional electrostatic shift of the one - electron potential of the @xmath3-th alloy component of net charge @xmath4 and @xmath5 the radius of the first coordination shell .",
    "in fact , the models described above are practically identical to the model proposed more than three decades ago @xcite to account for charge transfer effects in the self - consistent hartree scheme based on the tight - binding cpa . in this scheme",
    "the variation of the @xmath3-th atom energy level , @xmath6 , is proportional to the corresponding charge transfer @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is some average _ intra - atomic _ coulomb interaction .",
    "the non - self - consistent limit corresponds to @xmath9 , while @xmath10 provides local neutrality @xcite . in the present context",
    "one may identify @xmath6 with @xmath2 and it therefore follows that @xmath11 may be considered an intrasite coulomb interaction .",
    "although there is at least some consensus concerning the definition of the additional electrostatic shift ( [ eq : v_sim ] ) , which gives charge transfers quite close to the values obtained in supercell calculations @xcite , different workers do not agree on the corresponding electrostatic contribution to the total energy of the random alloy .",
    "some completely deny even the possibility of having such a term in a `` consistent '' ss - dft - cpa theory @xcite while others argue about the details of how this term should be defined .",
    "it would seem that the presently suggested models of charge transfer effects in the single - site approximation to the electrostatic problem , except the trivial elimination of the net charges by adjusting the radii of the atomic spheres of the alloy components , may be considered neither exact nor even `` a consistent theory '' .",
    "it is the main purpose of the present paper to shown that a consistent ss - dft - cpa theory including a correct description of the charge transfer effects does indeed exist .    here",
    ", we define the electrostatic shift of the one - electron potential and the corresponding contribution to the total energy in a form which is very similar to that proposed by korzhavyi _",
    "_ @xcite as well as johnson and pinski @xcite , and which provides a practically _ exact _ solution to the electrostatic problem in the single - site approximation .",
    "the actual expression for the electrostatic shift in the single - site model for poisson s equation includes one adjustable parameter the value of which is to be obtained in supercell calculations by the locally self - consistent green s function method in which the madelung problem is solved exactly .",
    "it turns out that the value of the adjustable parameter is practically independent of lattice structure , volume , and alloy composition due to the fact that the screening of the electrostatic part of the problem , in the asa at least , is almost universal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we outline the main concepts behind the lsgf used in this work and the details of the calculations . in sec .",
    "iii we present a pragmatic solution to the problem of finding the madelung shift in ss - dft calculations on the basis of the average values of the net charges and coulomb shifts , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , from supercell calculations .",
    "we also demonstrate that the linear relation between the net charges , @xmath4 , and the corresponding coulomb shifts , @xmath2 , of the alloy components discovered for metallic alloys by faulkner _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is practically universal in the effective medium approach for the green s function .",
    "this means that the response of the electron system to the coulomb field is linear and universal in such systems , and that the screening must be universal too . that this is indeed the case is demonstrated in the next section where we calculate the distribution of the screening charge in several systems and",
    "show that it is almost independent of the crystal structure , the alloy constituents , and the composition .    in sec .",
    "v we present a formalism for the screened coulomb interactions in the single - site mean - field approach for the electrostatic potential and energy and demonstrate that the conventional assumption of a vanishing madelung potential and energy is not valid in general .",
    "instead , one must include an additional term due to _ intrasite _ interactions which are , in fact , exactly the screened coulomb interactions .",
    "we also discuss the ordering contribution to the madelung energy and show why the screening contribution may be obtained in supercell calculations for ordered structures .",
    "the contribution from the screened coulomb interaction to the generalized perturbation method and the @xmath0 formalism is also determined .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "vi , we demonstrate that the total energy of a random alloy may be reproduced exactly in single - site cpa - dft calculations with corrections due to the screening intrasite interaction .",
    "in this paper we will consider only such alloy systems that on an underlying crystal lattice with perfect translational symmetry satisfy two conditions : i ) spatial homogeneity and ii ) no correlations between the one - electron potentials at sufficiently large distances .",
    "for the coulomb interactions in a random alloy both conditions may be formulated explicitly in terms of the average monopole electrostatic potential @xmath2 in the atomic sphere around site @xmath3 due to the charge distribution in the whole of the remaining system . in an ordered alloy",
    "this potential is the madelung potential .",
    "specifically , the first condition means that any average values of products of potentials must be translationally invariant , i.e. ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the translation operator @xmath16 , and the second condition is    @xmath17    for @xmath18 .    according to lifshitz _",
    "@xcite the space formed by the complete set of distinct realizations of the potential @xmath2 on the lattice , the operator @xmath15 , and the property of spatial homogeneity plays the same role in the theory of disorder as the phase space , the operator of dynamical evolution , and liouville s theorem do in statistical mechanics .",
    "moreover , according to birkhoff s ergodic theorem , for any functional @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 is some random realization of the potential on the lattice we have    @xmath21 =   < f[{v_i } ] > , \\ ] ]    i.e. , the spatial and the phase - space average are equivalent @xcite .",
    "this equation constitutes the principle of spatial ergodicity , according to which all possible finite atomic arrangements may be realized in a single infinite sample if the conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "what makes the above principle work in practice is the fact that for self - averaging or `` measurable '' quantities , which have a well - defined limit when the volume of the systems approaches infinity , all the correlations of the atomic distribution become unimportant at some distances and , hence , the sample may be chosen finite .",
    "this may be formulated explicitly by means of the cluster expansion theorem @xcite which defines the corresponding measurable quantity in terms of the site occupation correlation functions    @xmath22    where @xmath23 are the coefficients or interaction parameters , @xmath24 the correlation function of the figure or cluster @xmath25 which corresponds to a specific position of the sites @xmath3 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 in the lattice , and @xmath28 = @xmath29 is the fluctuation of the site occupation numbers @xmath30 taking on values 0 and 1 depending on whether site @xmath3 is occupied by one or the other component .",
    "according to ( [ clexp ] ) there are two practical ways of calculating the properties of a random system for which we have @xmath31 and , thus , @xmath32 : i ) the cluster or supercell approach , where @xmath31 is satisfied on average only for those clusters @xmath25 for which @xmath33 , or ii ) the effective medium approach , which directly gives @xmath34 from some knowledge of the alloy components .",
    "the first approach is realized , for instance , in the so - called special quasirandom structure ( sqs ) method @xcite while the second approach is realized by the coherent potential approximation where the real atoms are substituted by a specifically chosen effective medium on the lattice .      the supercell and the effective medium approaches are combined into a single computational scheme in the locally self - consistent green s function ( lsgf ) method @xcite . in the lsgf method",
    "the supercell approach is used to provide the correct solution to the madelung problem for a given alloy modeled by an appropriate supercell .",
    "it is also used in part in the electronic structure calculations , which are performed separately for every atom in the supercell by means of the local interaction zone centered at each atom . inside the liz",
    "the multipole scattering equations are solved exactly , while the region outside the liz is represented by the effective medium , which is usually taken to be the cpa effective medium built on all the one - electron potentials in the supercell .",
    "this means that every atom of the supercell `` sees '' only the cpa effective medium outside the liz , which according to the cpa definition represents a random alloy .",
    "in other words , the one - electron green s function of the supercell ( sc ) obtained in lsgf calculations may be presented as @xcite    @xmath35 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is the green function of the @xmath3th atom in the supercell embedded in the cpa effective medium , @xmath37 the contribution to @xmath38 due to the presence of the specific atomic arrangements on the figure @xmath25 in the liz as specified by the correlation function @xmath39 , which is equal to that of the supercell @xmath40 if the figure @xmath25 is circumscribed by the liz , i.e. , it can be put inside the liz in such a way that one of its vertices coincides with the central atom of the liz , otherwise @xmath39=0 .",
    "equation ( [ g_lsgf ] ) clearly shows how the lsgf works , and in particular , how the effective medium approach , represented by @xmath36 , is combined with the cluster or supercell approach , represented by by the second term .",
    "it follows from ( [ g_lsgf ] ) that the liz allows one effectively to cut off the contributions from the clusters which are not circumscribed by the liz ( an equivalent formulation in terms of effective interactions is given in ref .",
    "if the liz is single - site , i.e. , it consists of only one atom ( liz=1 ) , the contributions from the second term in ( [ g_lsgf ] ) vanish and we are left with the usual cpa or pure effective medium approach to the electronic structure problem .",
    "it is this single - site approach , referred to as ss - lsgf , which will be used in most of the present work .",
    "it has the advantage over the usual ss - dft - cpa method that poisson s equation is solved exactly within a given approximation for the form of the electron density .",
    "note , however , that the lsgf method by no means is restricted to the single - site approximation .",
    "in fact , it allows us to include local environment effects in the electronic structure calculations for the figures circumscribed by the liz if on average @xmath41 which is the case in a random alloy . in this respect",
    "the lsgf method may be considered a _ self - consistent _ embedded cluster method ( ecm ) of the kind proposed by gonis _",
    "@xcite more than two decades ago . with a proper choice of the supercell used to model a given random alloy @xcite",
    "the lsgf solves two major problems of the ecm : i ) it provides a set of clusters to represent an alloy with a given short range order and ii ) it allows one to close the dft loop with the correct treatment of the electrostatics .",
    "there is one important point concerning the electronic structure obtained in the lsgf with the cpa effective medium which should be mentioned : despite the fact that it can be quantitatively accurate , it is _ qualitatively _ different from the electronic structure which would result from direct supercell calculations with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "that is , the electronic spectrum in the lsgf - cpa method is always complex , unless all the atoms are equivalent in the supercell ( pure metal ) or the size of the liz is infinite .",
    "thus , in the lsgf - cpa the electronic structure of an _ ordered _ alloy is never correct , although it may be calculated with arbitrarily high accuracy . on the other hand , since blochs theorem is not applied to the supercell during the electronic structure calculations , the lsgf method is a perfect tool for calculating sqs as opposed to the ordinary band structure methods , which in this case lead to a real , i.e. , qualitatively incorrect , electronic structure of the random alloys due to the fact they present purely a supercell approach .",
    "it is possible to obtain the madelung potential and energy by a combined supercell ( cluster ) and effective medium approach similar to that used in the green s function approach to the electronic structure problem within the lsgf method .",
    "however , this requires some knowledge of the charge - charge correlations or the screening in the alloy .",
    "hence , the only way to solve the problem is to use a supercell model with the madelung potential and energy determined exactly from the _ bare _ electrostatic interactions , as it is usually done . here",
    ", another problem arises : the supercell should be constructed such as to provide zero correlation functions up to the distance where the net charges of the alloy components become uncorrelated or completely screened .    in the calculations presented below we assume at the outset the existence of a short - range screening which occurs over the distance of the first several coordination shells .",
    "this assumption is based on results obtained by the charge - correlated model @xcite , on single - impurity calculations @xcite as well as on the most recent lsgf calculations by ujfalussy _",
    "the latter authors demonstrated that a 16-atom supercell for an fcc equiatomic random alloy , in which the sro parameter at the 8th coordination shell must be equal to 1 due to the translation symmetry , i.e. , all the atoms in the 8th coordination shell are the same as that at the central site , yields practically the same average charge transfer and total energy as a 250-atom supercell , in which the sro parameter at the 8th coordination shell corresponding to a random number generator distribution of the alloy components on the lattice should be @xmath42 1 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in all the random alloys considered below the distribution of the atoms in the supercell was chosen such that the sro parameters ( or pair correlation functions , @xmath43 ) were exactly zero at least in the first 6 coordination shells and small ( not greater 0.01 in absolute value ) up to the 8th coordination shell .",
    "although the multisite correlation functions have not been optimized , they should not play a significant role in the asa where only monopole intersite coulomb interactions are taken into account .",
    "the electronic structure calculations were in all cases performed in the scalar relativistic approximation by the kkr - asa technique @xcite with an @xmath44- , @xmath45- , and @xmath46basis in the framework of either the usual ss - dft - cpa or the lsgf methods with a cpa effective medium .",
    "the asa ( no multipole corrections to the madelung potential and energy ) has been used in the electrostatic part of the problem .",
    "the integration of the green s function over energy was performed in the complex plane over 16 - 20 energy points on a semicircular contour .",
    "the local density approximation was used in the dft part with the perdew and zunger @xcite parameterization of the results by ceperly and alder @xcite .",
    "here we discuss a pragmatic solution to the following problem : can one devise a madelung potential for the alloy components to be used in ss - dft - cpa calculations such that the charge transfer effects , i.e. , the net charges of the alloy components , are consistent with those obtained in ss - lsgf calculations where charge transfer effects are treated properly ? the fact , that such a potential can be found , may seem surprising in view of the principle difference between the lsgf and the ss - dft - cpa methods . in the lsgf approach",
    "all the atoms in the supercell are different due to their different local environment while in the usual ss - dft - cpa approach one deals only with average quantities , i.e. , in terminology of the ref .",
    "@xcite , the lsgf supercell approach is equivalent to the _ polymorphous _ model of the alloy while the effective - medium approach is equivalent to the _ isomorphous _ model . however , it is obvious , that this can be done _ on average_.    it was discovered by faulkner _ et al . _",
    "@xcite from supercell calculations that the net charges on different sites @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and the corresponding madelung potentials , @xmath2 , obey a linear relationship . in fig .",
    "[ qv_alli ] we show such a @xmath47 relation for a 512-atom supercell which models a random al@xmath48li@xmath48 alloy on an underlying fcc lattice . for comparison",
    "we also show the charge and madelung shift for alli in the ordered l1@xmath49 structure .",
    "all results are obtained by lsgf calculations with the cpa effective medium in i ) the single - site approximation for the electronic part of the problem , ss - lsgf , i.e. , liz=1 , ( upper panel ) and ii ) with the perturbation in the electronic structure caused by the local environment up to the second coordination shell , i.e. , embedded cluster(ec)-lsgf , liz=3,(lower panel ) , included in the green s function . for random alloys the inclusion of more distant coordination shells do not affect the results significantly and thus the liz=3 results may be considered to be converged in the liz size .",
    "the most striking feature of the @xmath47 relation obtained in the ss - lsgf calculations is the perfect alignment of the @xmath47 points along two almost straight lines , one for each alloy component .",
    "this is , in fact , very similar to what has been observed by pinski @xcite in model calculations using the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "furthermore , a change of the ratio of the atomic sphere radii of the alloy components , @xmath50 , leads to a rescaling of the @xmath47 points .",
    "hence , for a specific ratio , @xmath51 in the present case , the @xmath47 relation collapses into the single point : @xmath52 .",
    "the existence of this point in the ss - lsgf is a consequence of the fact that all al atoms as well as all li atoms become indistinguishable if the net charges of the alloy components are zero : the difference between the atoms caused by local environment effects is solely due to the madelung shift , which is zero in this case .",
    "thus , for this particular choice of @xmath53 the polymorphous model is identical to the usual isomorphous model , or the ss - lsgf method is identical to the ss - dft - cpa method .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that the two models are not equivalent when local environment effects are included in the electronic structure part of the lsgf method , i.e , for liz@xmath541 .",
    "this is demonstrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ qv_alli ] where the local environment effects are clearly seen to destroy the strict alignment of the @xmath47 points and , as consequence , the possibility of choosing electroneutral atomic spheres by a single @xmath53 value .",
    "however , even if this were possible , all the atoms , or the corresponding one - electron potentials , would still be different .",
    "the discussion of local environment effects is beyond the scope of the present paper , and the results are included only to demonstrate the _ qualitative _ difference between the correct results and those obtained by the lsgf method in the single - site approximation : inclusion of intersite correlations in the electronic structure calculations leads to a real polymorphous description of random alloys which can not be mimicked by a single - site liz . as a consequence , as we will show later the ss - dft - cpa method can reproduce the results of the ss - lsgf exactly , but will , in general , reproduce only approximately the correct solution to the supercell or polymorphous model of a random alloy .",
    "the two @xmath47 points for the ordered l1@xmath49 structure are seen to fall on the @xmath47 lines for the random alloy as already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and , in fact , all the points on the @xmath47 relation obtained by the ss - lsgf method may be reproduced by a series of ordinary ss - dft - cpa calculations , by using the shift of the one - electron potential defined in a way similar to ( [ eq : v_sim ] ) , i.e. ,    @xmath55    where @xmath4 is the net charge of the alloy components , @xmath56 the wigner - seitz radius , and @xmath57 a parameter which may be varied arbitrarily in the ss - dft - cpa calculations without specifying its physical meaning .",
    "however , it is important to note , that @xmath58 corresponds to the electroneutral case ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath60 to the limit where there is no response of the system to charge transfer effects . as we will see later ,",
    "the values of the net charges @xmath61 obtained in the ss - dft - cpa calculations with @xmath60 are important scaling parameters .",
    "it is also useful to note , that for the l1@xmath49 structure @xmath62=0.8811575 @xcite , and in the screened impurity model ( [ eq : v_sim ] ) @xmath63 0.552669 and 0.568542 for the fcc and bcc crystal structures , respectively .",
    "[ qv_alli ] shows the @xmath47 relation , indicated by the black line , obtained in the ss - dft - cpa calculations including ( [ eq : v ] ) with @xmath57 varying from @xmath641.5 to 5 together with the ss - lsgf results , gray circles .",
    "it is clearly seen that the _",
    "`` isomorphous '' _ and _ polymorphous _",
    "@xmath47 relations coincide , and this allows one to make an isomorphous model consistent with the polymorphous results .",
    "the point is that all the net charges and corresponding coulomb shifts in the polymorphous model have significance only in terms of the average values they produce .",
    "this is so , because every supercell has its own set of net charges and madelung shifts and , in the case of an infinite system , there is an infinite number of different @xmath47 points . their average values , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , however , have a well - defined physical meaning as conditional averages of self - averaging quantities , and thus it is the average @xmath65 point which must be reproduced by the isomorphous model .",
    "hence , for a random alloy @xmath57 is given by    @xmath66    note , that in a binary ab alloy , it clearly does not matter , for which alloy component , @xmath67 , @xmath68 is determined , since @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the same is true for multicomponent alloys , but in this case , rather than being a trivial consequence of the charge neutrality condition , it follows from the physical origin of @xmath68 , which will be discussed in the next two sections . for an fcc al@xmath48li@xmath48 alloy at @xmath56=2.954 a.u .",
    "we find from the lsgf calculations @xmath700.60716 .",
    "of course , the coincidence of ( @xmath71 ) is a necessary , but not sufficient condition for the equivalence of the isomorphous and polymorphous models .",
    "the two models may be called equivalent only if the electronic structure of the random alloy and its conditional averages agree . in fig .",
    "[ dos ] we show that this is indeed the case : the local densities of states ( dos ) for the al and li atoms in al@xmath48li@xmath48 calculated by the ss - dft - cpa method coincide with the corresponding conditional average state densities obtained in the ss - lsgf calculations for the 512-atom supercell . for comparison",
    "we also show the dos obtained with @xmath720 corresponding to the `` conventional '' cpa . although the latter differs from the correct state density , it is obvious , that the neglect of the electrostatic shift ( [ eq : v ] ) has only a minor effect on the dos .",
    "the reason why the average state densities coincide is the following : in the ss - lsgf method the difference between the atoms of the same type comes only through the corresponding madelung shift . a shift in potential leads to a change in the charge transfer through a _ skewing _ of the local dos as seen in fig .  [ dos2 ] .",
    "therefore , when the conditionally averaged dos is obtained , the skewing contributions from the individual atomic sites caused by @xmath2 will cancel and leave only the dos given by the average @xmath13 .",
    "of course , this is true only in the ss - lsgf method ( liz=1 ) .",

    "in the previous section we have , in effect , defined a procedure whereby ss - dft - cpa calculations may provide the exact solution to the electrostatic problem in random alloys .",

    "the linear character of the @xmath47 relation indicates that the screening in the impurity case as well as in the case of a random alloy may be very well described by linear response theory .",
    "owing to enhanced electron scattering at opposite regions of the fermi surface linear response predicts in the case of a free - electron gas the existence of long - range friedel oscillations , which however decrease relatively fast ( @xmath83 ) with the distance . in a random alloy ,",
    "on the other hand , the screening is much more efficient due to the finite life time of the bloch states for the underlying crystal lattice and the spatial distribution of the screening density decays exponentially .",
    "in this respect charge correlated model @xcite adopted by johnson and pinski @xcite in the cc- and scr - cpa method or the equivalent screened impurity model @xcite may be viewed as the first approximations for the screening .",
    "based on the fact , that a single impurity in a metallic host is a particular case of a dilute random alloy , one would expect , and the results for a single cu impurity in pt presented in the previous section unambiguously indicate this , that the screening effects in the two cases are similar .",
    "it is therefore surprising that faulkner _",
    "_ @xcite and ujfalussy _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite claim that the screening in a random alloy is _ qualitatively _ different from that found in a single impurity system .",
    "in fact , these authors found extremely long - range correlations between the madelung potential at some particular site and the net charges at the other sites .",
    "since the madelung shift on a site is proportional to the net charge on the site , this may happen only if there are extremely long - ranged correlations between net charges or , in other words , there is no screening .",
    "however , this result has been obtained on the basis of summations of the direct or _ bare _",
    "coulomb interactions which is , at best , an ill - defined procedure , even mathematically .    to clarify the issue of screening we will perform the following computer experiment which will allow us to establish the range of the net - charge correlations or the screening in random alloys for one particular site .",
    "we set up a 512-atom supercell which represents an fcc cu@xmath48pt@xmath48 random alloy ( all sro parameters are equal to zero up to the sixth coordination shell and @xmath84 0 for at least the next 10 coordination shells ) and perform self - consistent ss - lsgf ( liz=1 ) and ec - lsgf ( liz=3 ) calculations .",
    "we then substitute one pt atom with one cu atom in some site which , in general , may be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "however , to keep the atomic distribution as close as possible to the random distribution we chose a site the local environment of which corresponds to the random alloy ( having equal number of cu and pt atoms ) for the first three coordination shells .",
    "we then repeat the self - consistent lsgf calculations for the supercell with the substituted atom and find new values for the net charges in the supercell .",
    "it is clear that , when liz=1 , the difference between the net charges in the two calculations , @xmath85 , gives the charges induced by the change of the net charge at the substitution site ( in the case of liz=3 the local environment effects also effect the charge transfer ) .",
    "this charge is simply the screening charge .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ q_scr ] we have plotted the normalized , induced charges    @xmath86    at the first eight coordination shells around the substitution site @xmath87 for cu - pt substitution in a cu@xmath48pt@xmath48 random alloy and for cu - pt substitution in pure pt ( @xmath73 3 a.u . ) obtained in the single - site approximation for the electronic structure ( liz=1 ) as well as with local environment effects included ( liz=3 ) .",
    "one may see that , while the local environment in a pure metal hardly affects the distribution of the net charges , it does introduce a dispersion in the distribution of the net charges in the random alloy , which is quite substantial at the first coordination shell but which practically disappears beyond the 5th coordination shell where , in fact , all the induced charges almost vanish .    to demonstrate that the net charge of the cu `` impurity '' indeed becomes screened we show in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ q_scr ] the total normalized induced charge in the @xmath3th shell    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the coordination number of the @xmath26th shell .",
    "i is seen that @xmath90 vanishes beyond the 7th coordination shell in all cases , and we conclude that the screening in a random alloy in the single - site approximation is practically the same as the screening in the case of a single impurity in a pure metal . there is neither qualitative nor quantitative differences between the impurity and the alloy cases .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ q_scr_all ] we show the distribution of the screening charge ( not to be confused with the screening _ density _ : the screening charge is , in fact , the screening density integrated in the corresponding atomic sphere ) for a cu impurity in fcc , bcc , and bct pt plotted as a function of the distance from the impurity site in units of the wigner - seits radius , @xmath56 .",
    "it is clear that the screening charge follows a single , common curve which does not depend on the structure .",
    "in fact , by changing the @xmath91 ratio in the bct structure one may completely fill the remaining gaps in the calculated curve . in the lower panel of the figure",
    "we have collected the results for the distribution of the screening charges in seven different systems including such hosts as pt , al , cu , v , na , and k. it appears that the screening in metallic alloys depends neither on the crystal structure nor on the nature of the alloy components , at least , when described within the asa .    the universal picture of the screening in alloy systems found above is partly destroyed when the electrostatics is treated more correctly , for instance by including multipole moment contributions to the one electron madelung potential and energy .",
    "however , the asa still gives a qualitatively correct picture and catches the main physics behind the phenomenon .",
    "hence , it is worth to discuss the origin of such a universality in both the screening and the response function .",
    "first of all , it was understood long time ago that the net charges in the atomic spheres of the alloy components has very little in common with the `` charger transfer '' in terms of the redistribution of the electron charge between the alloy components ( see , for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) . even in the case of the so - called ionic solids",
    "the self - consistent charge distribution is very close to that obtained from a linear superposition of the free - atom electron - densities @xcite and this is the reason for the success of the charge - correlated model @xcite , in which the net charge is proportional to the number of nearest neighbors of the opposite type ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    what we are seeing is basically a size effect :",
    "the net charges originate from the redistribution of the electron density in the _ interstitial _ region between the atomic spheres .",
    "the electron density in metals and their alloys in this region is very smooth and may be well described by a free - electron model , even for transition metal alloys .",
    "the interstitial density is much easier to perturb than the density closer to the atomic nuclei and it participates in the screening . on this basis",
    "one may , in fact , developed a model based on linear response theory which leads to a semi - analytical description of the universal screening .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the calculated distribution of the screening net charge may be used to obtain the screening contribution to the one - electron potential in the single - site model for the poisson equation given by ( [ eq : v ] ) with @xmath57 equal to    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the radius of the @xmath3th shell with coordination number @xmath94 . using the results for the screening charge , @xmath90 , in the case of cu - pt substitution for one particular site ( not on average ! ) in the cu@xmath48pt@xmath48 random alloy we find from ( [ eq : alpha_scr ] ) after summation up to the 8th coordination shell that @xmath95 = 0.60572 . at the same time , the average values of the net charges and the madelung potentials , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , in conjunction with ( [ eq : alpha ] ) gives @xmath68 = 0.60530 .",
    "that is , @xmath98 .",
    "since , there is only one effective medium in the supercell lsgf calculations , it is obvious that the screening is the same for all the sites and , thus , should not depend on the alloy component , that is , the ratio @xmath99 does not depend on the alloy components .",
    "it is important to understand that @xmath68 appears in the formalism due to the _ intrasite _ interactions between the electron density inside an atomic sphere and its screening ( or missing ) charge .",
    "therefore the inclusion of ( [ eq : v ] ) in ss - dft - cpa calculations does not _ in any way _ contradict the `` conventional '' mean - field picture according to which the contribution from _ intersite _ interactions to the madelung potential is zero in the ss - dft - cpa .",
    "in fact , neglecting the term will lead to incorrect results . on the other hand , the parameter @xmath62 which allows one to perform ss - dft - cpa calculations _",
    "identical _ to those of the ss - dft - cpa for the l1@xmath49 structure , has an origin different from that of @xmath95 determined by ( [ eq : alpha_scr ] ) .",
    "the former is a constant , which apart from the @xmath100 symmetry does not depend on anything , and in particular , not on the screening , while the latter is a system dependent parameter which is entirely determined by the type of intersite interactions or the screening in a given system .",
    "this means that there is no connection between the madelung constants for ordered structures and @xmath95 .",
    "the reason why it is possible to obtain @xmath95 from the supercell calculations for the completely ordered structures , as we have just done , is the fact that at the large distances , where the atomic - distribution correlation - functions are not zero anymore , the `` real '' _ intersite _ interactions do not contribute to the electrostatics due to the short - ranged screening .",
    "we will return to this point in the discussion of the coulomb energy of a random alloy , but here we would like to comment on the use of the single - site approximation in the green s function calculations .",
    "our lsgf calculations of impurities in different metals indicate that the problems observed in the single - site green s function impurity calculations by stefanou @xcite and drittler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite do not originate from the single - site approximation for the dyson equation , but from poisson s equation , which these authors also solve in the single - site approximation .",
    "the use of the screening electrostatic shift for the one - electron potential allows one to solve the impurity problem in the single - site green s function formalism in the asa or in the mt approximation almost exactly .",
    "this is so because the impurity case corresponds to the dilute limit of a random alloy where the concentration of one of the alloy components approaches zero . in this case , the contribution to the electronic structure due to the local environment effects becomes negligible , and the electronic structure of the impurity obtained by the single - site or the cluster dyson equations become almost identical .",
    "such an effect may be seen , for instance , in fig .",
    "[ q_scr ] : the dispersion of the screening net charge found in the concentrated alloy case , i.e. , cu@xmath48pt@xmath48 ( liz=3 ) , vanishes in the case of a cu impurity in pt .",
    "the effect is , in fact , the origin of the increasing accuracy of the cpa with decreasing concentration of one of the alloy components .",
    "the formalism describing the electrostatics of random alloys in the single - site mean - field approximation , where all the a and all the b atoms are represented only by the appropriate conditional averages , is indeed a trivial one , although it has remained quite a confusing issue for more than 30 years , starting from the definition of the electrostatic energy of a random alloy given by harrison in 1966 in connection with pseudopotential theory @xcite .",
    "according to harrison the madelung energy , which may be associated with the electrostatic interactions of the net charges of the ions of a random a@xmath101b@xmath102 alloy , is given by @xcite    @xmath103    where @xmath104 are the ion charges of the alloy components , @xmath105 is the madelung constant of the underlying lattice , @xmath56 the radius of the wigner - seitz sphere , @xmath106 the average charge equal to @xmath107 , and @xmath108 some constant .    equation ( [ eq : e_harr ] ) was , in fact , not derived specifically for coulomb interactions .",
    "rather , it was suggested on the basis of a more general consideration of the band - structure contribution to the total energy of a random alloy within second order perturbation theory .",
    "later , it was shown by krasko @xcite that in a system with randomly distributed a and b ions , having charges @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively , embedded in a medium of compensating charges , the electrostatic energy included only the second term in ( [ eq : e_harr ] ) while the first term vanished .",
    "it is obvious that ( [ eq : e_harr ] ) is valid also in the cpa - dft if one substitutes the ion charges @xmath104 by the net charges @xmath4 of the atomic spheres . in the asa",
    "the average charge @xmath111 is zero , and in this particular approximation the contribution to the madelung energy of a random alloy given by the second term in ( [ eq : e_harr ] ) will also vanish .",
    "note , however , that the term vanishes neither in inhomogeneous systems @xcite nor in the mt - approximation @xcite .",
    "this result was criticized by magri _",
    "@xcite who a decade ago deduced from calculations for ordered compounds that the net charge of the atomic sphere of an alloy component is proportional to the number of nearest neighbors of the opposite type , and on this basis developed the charge correlated model in which the madelung energy of a binary random alloy is given by    @xmath112    where @xmath113 is a constant equal to 0.5947049 and 0.60817846 for the fcc and bcc structures , respectively .",

    "this illustrates an important point : the ordering energy represented in reciprocal space in the concentration wave formalism must be corrected by the exclusion of the intrasite term , otherwise the theory will not be consistent .",
    "equation ( [ eq : h_conf_q ] ) gives the correct definition of the ordering energy considered more thoroughly in the appendix of ref .",

    "finally , performing the summation in ( [ v_scr_gpm_1 ] ) one may define the screened coulomb interactions as    @xmath187    it is easy to see from ( [ v_scr_gpm_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha_scr ] ) that @xmath188 and therefore , @xmath189 is exactly the on - site screened interactions that defines the madelung energy of the binary alloy which has exactly the same form ( [ eq : e_scr_rand ] ) .",
    "this on - site interaction must be included in the definition of the @xmath0 interactions @xcite , as has been demonstrated in the previous section ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . when @xmath190 , @xmath191 defines the intersite screened coulomb interaction contribution to the gpm - like effective interactions .",
    "since the screening in the asa , is practically universal these interactions have the universal form presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : vscr ] .",
    "the fact that the madelung energy of a random alloy described either by the effective medium model defined by the ss - dft - cpa method or by the supercell model in conjunction with the ss - lsgf method differ from each other , has neither consequences for the final result for the total energy of the random alloy nor even for the partial and local contributions to the total energy .",
    "this follows simply from the fact that the density of states and its average local contributions are the same in the two methods , as shown above .    in table",
    "[ e_iso_pol ] we compare the total energy and its components in a cu@xmath48pt@xmath48 random alloy calculated by the ss - dft - cpa method with @xmath1920.60572 and by the ss - lsgf method on the basis of a 512-atom supercell , in which the atomic positions of cu and pt have been chosen such that the sro parameters are equal zero at the first 7 coordinations shells ( lsgf-1 ) .",
    "the agreement between the two calculations is seen to be excellent if one combines the electron - nucleus , the electron - electron , and the madelung contributions to form a total coulomb energy , @xmath193 .",
    "the accuracy of the ss - dft - cpa method with the appropriate screening contribution to the madelung potential and energy may be appreciated if one compares the results of a 512-atom supercell calculation performed by the ss - lsgf method ( lsgf-2 ) where the distribution of the cu and pt atoms have not been optimized after the application of the random number generator leading to quite small , but not zero , sro parameters .",
    "the values of the sro parameters for the first 7 coordination shells are @xmath640.005208 ( 1 ) , 0.026041 ( 2 ) , 0.007161(3 ) , -0.014323(4 ) , -0.021484(5 ) , 0.0390625(6 ) , @xmath640.0136718 ( 7 ) , respectively , which are approximately the same , as in the lsms calculations in ref .",
    "the agreement between ss - dft - cpa results and ss - lsgf calculations with a properly chosen supercell ( lsgf-1 ) is obviously better than between two ss - lsgf calculations .",
    "the screened coulomb interactions which are due to the interaction between the net charge of an alloy component and its screening charge must be included in a consistent single - site mean - field theory of the electrostatics in random alloys . in this paper",
    "we have shown how this may be done and we have calculated the spatial distribution of the screening charge which in the asa is found to be practically universal for homogeneous systems . a formalism that describes the contribution from for the screened coulomb interaction to madelung potential and energy as well as to the effective interactions of the gpm - type is presented .",
