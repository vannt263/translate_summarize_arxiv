    "the phenomenon of induced fermion number arises due to the interaction of fermions with nontrivial topological backgrounds ( e.g. , solitons , vortices , monopoles , skyrmions ) , and has many applications ranging from polymer physics to particle physics @xcite .",
    "the original fractional fermion number result of jackiw and rebbi @xcite provides the physical explanation of the existence of spinless charged excitations in polymers @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic analysis of goldstone and wilczek @xcite in systems without conjugation symmetry has important implications for model field theories in particle physics , such as bag models @xcite , electroweak theories @xcite , and chiral sigma models @xcite . at zero temperature ,",
    "the induced fermion number is a topological quantity , and is related to the spectral asymmetry of the relevant dirac operator , which counts the difference between the number of positive and negative energy states in the fermion spectrum @xcite .",
    "mathematical results , such as index theorems @xcite and levinson s theorem @xcite , imply that the zero temperature induced fermion number is determined by the asymptotic topological properties of the background fields .",
    "this topological character of the induced fermion number is a key feature of its application in certain model field theories @xcite .    at finite temperature , the situation is less clear - cut . in several examples ,",
    "namely the @xmath2 dimensional chiral kink background @xcite and the @xmath3 dimensional dirac @xcite and t hooft - polyakov monopole @xcite backgrounds , the finite temperature induced fermion number has been shown to be temperature dependent , but still topological in the sense that the only dependence on the background field is through its asymptotic properties . however , it has recently been demonstrated @xcite that the finite temperature induced fermion number need not be topological .",
    "explicitly , in a @xmath2 dimensional chiral sigma model , the finite temperature induced fermion number depends on the detailed structure of the background , not just its asymptotic behavior .",
    "this result corrects several previous analyses @xcite that had claimed that the finite temperature fermion number was in general a topological quantity ( at zero chemical potential ) . in @xcite , an explicit calculation showed that the finite temperature fermion number can be nontopological , and a simple physical explanation was given for the origin of the nontopological fermion number as the plasma response of the fermions to the inhomogeneous background . a possible source of confusion here",
    "is that while the kink and sigma model cases are very similar at zero temperature , it is not widely appreciated that at finite temperature they are very different . in this paper",
    "we present more details of this analysis , and we present a general argument that the finite temperature fermion number naturally separates into a temperature - independent topological piece that corresponds to vacuum polarization effects , and a temperature - dependent piece that is _ generically _ nontopological , and which corresponds to the thermal occupation of excited states of the fermion fock space .",
    "while this temperature - dependent piece is generically nontopological , for certain particular backgrounds ( such as , for example , the kink background ) the fermion spectrum has a special symmetry , which has the consequence that the temperature - dependent corrections are in fact themselves topological .",
    "another motivation for our work concerns the nature of the induced fermion number as a sharp quantum observable . at zero temperature",
    "it has been shown that the fractional induced fermion number is indeed a sharp observable @xcite . in this paper",
    "we address this question at finite temperature by computing the rms fluctuations , @xmath4 , in the induced fermion number @xmath0 .",
    "we compute the finite temperature fluctuation in two different cases , and show that @xmath5 is generally nonzero ( and nontopological ) at finite temperature , but that @xmath5 vanishes at zero temperature .",
    "this indicates that @xmath6 is _ not _ a sharp quantum observable at nonzero temperature .",
    "the nonvanishing fluctuations are due to the mixing of fock states inherent in the thermal expectation value .",
    "it is interesting to note that another example of non - sharp fractional fermion number ( but not in the context of temperature dependence ) has been discussed recently in the context of liquid helium bubbles @xcite .",
    "our analysis of finite temperature fermion number has also been motivated by the realization over recent years that certain types of anomalies in zero temperature field theory become much more subtle at finite temperature .",
    "for example , pisarski et al have explained @xcite why finite temperature anomalous @xmath7 decay amplitudes are temperature dependent even though the chiral anomaly ( a topological object that is known to be related to the anomalous @xmath7 decay amplitude at @xmath8 ) is known to be temperature independent .",
    "these and related issues have also been explored in @xmath2 dimensions @xcite . and in odd spacetime dimensions , it has recently been realized @xcite that while the topological chern - simons term is the only parity - violating term that can be induced in the @xmath8 effective action , at finite temperature there are infinitely many other parity - violating terms , all of which vanish identically at zero temperature , but all of which are crucial , for example , for understanding how it is possible to maintain large gauge invariance at finite temperature .",
    "these results have led us to reconsider the related general question of induced fermion number at finite temperature .    in section",
    "ii we define what is meant by finite temperature induced fermion number , and indicate how it can be computed .",
    "in section iii we give more details of the derivations and results of @xcite for the finite temperature induced fermion number @xmath0 for a kink background and for a sigma model background in @xmath2 dimensional field theory .",
    "section iv presents the computation of the finite temperature fluctuations , @xmath9 , in the induced fermion number for the kink case and for the sigma model case . in section",
    "v we give a simple physical interpretation of all these results in terms of the thermal occupation of the available levels in the dirac spectrum , according to fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "we conclude in section vi and give some general comments regarding the extension of our results to higher dimensional theories .",

    "1 . in the sigma model case ( [ sigma ] ) , the angular field @xmath25 has the interpretation of a local chiral angle , since the chiral constraint ( [ sigma ] ) allows us to write @xmath26 and @xmath27 , so that the interaction term in the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) is @xmath28 in this sigma model case , it is the angular field @xmath25 that has a kink - like shape , as shown in fig .",

    "the fermion field operator @xmath30 may be expanded in a complete set of eigenstates of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath31 for fermions in the presence of the background fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 . the dirac hamiltonian corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) is @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and we have chosen to work with the dirac matrices : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the presence of the background fields modifies the fermion spectrum from the free case .",
    "all necessary information about the fermion spectrum can be encoded in terms of the spectral function @xmath37 of the dirac hamiltonian in ( [ ham ] ) : @xmath38 the zero temperature vacuum expectation value , @xmath39 , of the number operator can be expressed as @xcite @xmath40 where the subscript @xmath41 refers to zero temperature .",
    "thus , @xmath42 is expressed in terms of the _ spectral asymmetry _ of the dirac operator , which counts the number of positive energy states minus the number of negative energy states .    at zero temperature , in both the kink case ( [ kink ] ) and the sigma model case ( [ sigma ] ) , the induced fermion number ( [ asymmetry ] ) is given by the simple expression @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath25 is the angular field defined in ( [ theta ] ) , and",

    "the original conjugation symmetric case of jackiw and rebbi @xcite is obtained by taking @xmath45 in the kink case ( [ kink ] ) , in which case @xmath46 . in section",
    "iv we will show that the zero temperature expectation value ( [ asymmetry ] ) is in fact also a sharp eigenvalue .",
    "at nonzero temperature , the induced fermion number is a thermal expectation value @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the inverse temperature .",
    "note that as @xmath49 , which means @xmath50 , only the vacuum state survives in the trace , and @xmath51 reduces to the vacuum expectation value @xmath42 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath52 , so that the integral expression in ( [ thermalexp ] ) reduces smoothly to the spectral asymmetry expression in ( [ asymmetry ] ) .",
    "in fact , the finite temperature expression ( [ thermalexp ] ) provides a physically natural , and computationally simple , regularization of the spectral asymmetry ( [ asymmetry ] ) . in section",
    "iv we will show that at nonzero temperature the fermion number expectation value ( [ thermalexp ] ) is not a sharp eigenvalue .    to compute @xmath42 or @xmath51",
    ", one needs information about the spectral function @xmath37 .",
    "we stress , of course , that @xmath37 has nothing to do with the temperature ; it simply describes the spectrum of the fermions in the presence of the static background fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "one convenient way to proceed is to use the expression ( [ spectral ] ) for the spectral function to write ( [ thermalexp ] ) as a contour integral in the complex energy plane : @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the _ resolvent _ of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath31 , and the contour @xmath55 is @xmath56 and @xmath57 , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . since @xmath31 has a real spectrum , we can evaluate the contour integral ( [ contour ] ) in two alternative ways .",
    "first , we can deform the contour around the simple poles of the @xmath58 function , which occur along the imaginary axis at the matsubara modes : @xmath59 , for @xmath60 .",
    "this leads to an expression for @xmath51 as an infinite sum .",
    "alternatively , we can deform the @xmath61 contour around the poles and cuts of the spectrum of @xmath31 , which lie on the real axis .",

    "this can be seen clearly in figs . 4 and 5 . but",
    "at finite temperature , the expressions ( [ kinkq ] ) and ( [ kinkint ] ) for the induced fermion number are much more complicated than the @xmath8 result ( [ nzero ] ) .",

    "this is still consistent ( to this order ) with the topological nature of the zero temperature induced fermion number ( [ nzero ] ) , because the energy trace prefactor multiplying the @xmath100 term in ( [ nthird ] ) vanishes at @xmath8 .",
    "higher orders in the derivative expansion ( [ third ] ) can be developed systematically , although it becomes somewhat tedious to enumerate all the different terms at high orders .",
    "however , a remarkable simplification occurs @xcite in the low temperature limit where @xmath101 .",
    "the leading low @xmath102 terms at each order of the derivative expansion have the simple form : @xmath103 thus , in the low temperature limit , we can resum the _ entire _ derivative expansion , to obtain the induced fermion number in the sigma model case ( [ sigma ] ) : @xmath104 where the dots refer to power - law subleading terms for @xmath101 .",
    "note that @xmath51 in ( [ resum ] ) naturally splits into a temperature independent topological term , and a temperature dependent nontopological term .",
    "this has a simple physical explanation @xcite .",
    "first , observe that the chiral sigma model background acts like a spatially inhomogeneous electric field @xcite , as can be seen by making a local chiral rotation : @xmath105 .",
    "in terms of these chirally rotated fields the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) , with interaction ( [ exp ] ) , becomes @xmath106 thus , the chiral field @xmath25 acts as an inhomogeneous scalar potential @xmath107 , leading to an inhomogeneous electric field @xmath108 this electric field acts on the dirac sea to polarize the vacuum by aligning the virtual vacuum dipoles of the dirac sea , producing a localized build - up of charge near the kink center . this leads to the first , topological , term in ( [ resum ] ) , which is just the familiar zero temperature result @xcite .",
    "it is temperature independent as the short - lived virtual electron - positron dipoles of the dirac sea do not come to thermal equilibrium .",
    "the second , nontopological , term in ( [ resum ] ) arises as the response of the real charges in the thermal plasma to the spatially inhomogeneous electric field @xcite . the linear response @xcite of the plasma at low temperature to such an electric field yields an induced fermion number density @xmath109 where @xmath110 is expressed in terms of the particle and antiparticle fermi densities . in the derivative expansion limit",
    ", the leading effect of the background is that of an inhomogeneous chemical potential @xmath111 .",
    "thus , in this limit , the local fermi particle and antiparticle distribution functions are @xmath112 the resummed derivative expansion expression ( [ resum ] ) was obtained in the low temperature ( @xmath101 ) limit . in this limit",
    ", we can write @xmath113 note that @xmath114 vanishes smoothly as @xmath98 in the derivative expansion regime , because @xmath115 . for low temperature ,",
    "the leading behavior of the k integral in ( [ linear ] ) is @xmath116 therefore , the plasma linear response contribution ( [ linear ] ) to the induced fermion number gives precisely the second , nontopological , term in the formula ( [ resum ] ) which was obtained by resumming the derivative expansion at low temperature .",
    "we now turn to the fluctuation , @xmath117 , in the induced fermion number @xmath51 .",
    "we will show that the fluctuation vanishes at zero temperature , but is nonzero at finite temperature .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuation is inherently nontopological , in both the kink and sigma model cases .",
    "recall that the fluctuation can be expressed in terms of the partition function as @xcite @xmath118_{\\mu=0 } \\label{fluctuation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the fluctuation can be expressed in a manner analogous to the fermion number expressions ( [ thermalexp ] ) and ( [ contour ] ) : @xmath119 from a purely computational viewpoint , there is an immediate difference between ( [ fluc ] ) and the fermion number expressions ( [ thermalexp ] ) and ( [ contour ] ) : since @xmath120 is an even function , we now need the _ even _ part of the spectral function ( equivalently , the _ odd _ part of the resolvent ) , whereas to compute @xmath51 one needs the _ odd _ part of the spectral function ( equivalently , the _ even _ part of the resolvent ) .",
    "the callias index theorem result ( [ index ] ) gives the exact form of the even part of the resolvent , but tells us nothing about the odd part of the resolvent .",
    "thus , in the kink case , we should no longer expect an exact topological result for the fluctuation @xmath121 .",
    "indeed , for a general kink background , an approximation is needed to compute the odd part of the resolvent . instead , here we will proceed by considering a special two - parameter family of kink backgrounds for which the both the even and odd parts of the resolvent _ can _ be computed exactly .",
    "consider @xmath122 where @xmath123 is an integer .",
    "the parameter @xmath124 represents the asymptotic value of the kink , while @xmath125 determines the _ scale _ of the kink , as illustrated in fig 6 . while not completely general , the family of kinks in ( [ special ] ) is sufficiently general to distinguish between the topological and nontopological effects . for these special kinks ,",

    "furthermore , at any finite temperature , the fluctuation ( [ fsm ] ) is clearly nontopological . in the next section",
    "we will see that this expression for the fluctuation has a simple plasma interpretation , analogous to the linear response explanation ( [ linear ] )  ( [ limit ] ) of the induced fermion number ( [ resum ] ) in the sigma model case .",
    "( this assumes @xmath146 .",
    "if @xmath147 , then the unpaired bound state would be at @xmath136 . )",
    "there are continuum thresholds at @xmath148",
    ". there may or may not be additional bound states with energies in the range @xmath149 , but if these states are present they are necessarily paired in @xmath150 pairs . ]    .",
    "there is no particular symmetry to the spectrum , and there may or may not be one or more bound states in the gap .",
    "this depends sensitively on the detailed form of the angular field @xmath25 . ]    in this section we give a simple physical interpretation of the results of the previous sections for the induced fermion number and its fluctuations , in terms of the spectrum of the fermions in the background field .",
    "let us first summarize the results .",
    "at zero temperature , the induced fermion number @xmath42 is always topological , and has vanishing fluctuation : @xmath151 . at finite temperature , @xmath51 is topological for a kink background , but nontopological for a sigma model background .",
    "for both the kink and sigma model cases , the fluctuation is non - vanishing , @xmath152 , at nonzero temperature , and @xmath153 is nontopological .",
    "the vanishing of the fluctuations at zero temperature is in agreement with previous arguments that the zero temperature induced fermion number is a sharp observable @xcite . at finite temperature",
    ", the nonvanishing fluctuation indicates that the induced fermion number is no longer a sharp observable .",
    "rather , it is a thermal expectation value that mixes contributions from different states in the fermion hilbert space .",
    "this is somewhat analogous to the recent observation of jackiw _ et al _ @xcite that fractional electron number in liquid helium bubbles is not sharp , due to state mixing .    in the sigma model case , the resummed derivative expansion result ( [ resum ] ) for @xmath51 suggested a natural separation of the finite temperature induced fermion number @xmath51 into a zero temperature topological piece @xmath42 and a nontopological piece that represents the plasma response to the background field ( in this case , an inhomogeneous electric field ) .",
    "this separation is , in fact , a general feature of the induced fermion number : @xmath51 splits into a topological piece @xmath42 that arises due to vacuum polarization effects ( and only involves the ground state of the second quantized hilbert space ) , and a nontopological piece that can be interpreted in terms of the thermal occupation numbers of nonvacuum states .",
    "the topological piece is temperature independent , while the nontopological piece is temperature dependent . to see how this separation arises ,",
    "note the simple identity @xmath154 where the fermi occupation number distribution is @xmath155 then the finite temperature induced fermion number ( [ thermalexp ] ) separates as @xmath156 the first term in ( [ split ] ) is just the zero temperature fermion number ( [ asymmetry ] ) , and is topological .",
    "however , the fact that the spectral asymmetry integral in ( [ asymmetry ] ) is always topological does not necessarily mean that @xmath157 is itself topological . the second term in ( [ split ] )",
    "is generically nontopological due to the weighting of the integral with the fermi distribution factor .",
    "however , in the special case of a kink background , @xmath157 is itself topological [ see the callias index theorem result ( [ index ] ) ] . thus the temperature - dependent second term in ( [ split ] ) is also topological in the kink case , even though the integral involves the fermi factor .",
    "this separation can be understood in terms of the dirac spectrum of the fermions in the given background .",
    "for example , in the kink case , the sommerfeld - watson integral representation ( [ kinkint ] ) for the induced fermion number can be re - expressed using ( [ int ] ) , ( [ tanh ] ) and ( [ split ] ) as : @xmath158 for _ any _ kink background ( with @xmath17 positive ) , the spectrum of the dirac hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) always has the form shown in fig .",
    "there are continuum states for @xmath159 , where we recall that @xmath160 , and @xmath161 is the asymptotic value of the kink field at @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , there is always a bound state at @xmath162 : @xmath163}\\right)\\quad { \\rm with\\,\\,energy } \\,\\ , e =- m,\\,\\ , { \\rm if}\\,\\ , \\hat{\\theta}>0\\nonumber\\\\ \\psi_b&=&\\left(\\matrix{\\exp[\\int^x \\phi_2]\\cr 0}\\right)\\quad { \\rm with\\,\\,energy } \\,\\ , e=+m,\\,\\ , { \\rm if}\\,\\ , \\hat{\\theta}<0 \\label{zero}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there may or may not be additional bound states with @xmath164 .",
    "if these additional bound states are present they necessarily occur in @xmath150 pairs , because of the quantum mechanical susy of the dirac hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in the kink case .",
    "thus , the contributions of these paired bound states to the second integral in ( [ split ] ) cancel in pairs , while the unpaired bound state at @xmath162 leads to the @xmath165 term in ( [ kinksp ] ) .",
    "the remaining integral over the continuum states leads to the integral term in ( [ kinksp ] ) , as an integral of the fermi factor @xmath166 over the continuum beginning at the threshold energy @xmath167 , with the integrand involving the odd part of the spectral function derived from the callias index theorem result ( [ index ] ) .    in the sigma model case",
    ", the dirac spectrum is very different . as discussed in section iii.b , the chiral field @xmath25 is equivalent to a spatially inhomogeneous electric field @xmath168 for fermions of mass @xmath94 . for a slowly varying background , with @xmath93 , the leading order effect on the spectrum",
    "is that of a local chemical potential @xmath169 .",
    "thus , we can approximate ( [ split ] ) as @xmath170 which agrees precisely with the low temperature resummed derivative expansion result ( [ resum ] ) , and which agrees with the plasma linear response result as explained in section iii.b .    from numerical analysis of the dirac equation for a sigma model background ,",
    "the dirac spectrum has the form shown in fig .",
    "note that , unlike the kink case spectrum depicted in fig .",
    "8 , there is no particular symmetry of the spectrum .",
    "the only general thing we can say is that the continuum thresholds are at @xmath171 .",
    "there may or may not be one or more bound states for @xmath172 .",
    "the existence of ( and the precise location of ) bound states is highly sensitive to the actual _ shape _ of the @xmath25 . as there is no special symmetry in the spectrum ,",
    "there is nothing general that can be said about the odd part of the spectral function .",
    "nevertheless , the first term in ( [ split ] ) , which is @xmath42 , yields a topological result since the integral can be written , using levinson s theorem , in terms of the phase shift at infinity , which is topological @xcite .",
    "this application of levinson s theorem does nt work for the second term in ( [ split ] ) because of the fermi factor .",
    "this is another way to understand why the finite temperature induced fermion number is generically nontopological . at low temperature , we see from ( [ split ] ) that the dominant correction to the zero temperature fermion number is determined by the bound state energy with the lowest magnitude : @xmath173 since the location of @xmath174 is sensitive to the detailed shape of @xmath25 , this shows that @xmath51 is generically nontopological .",
    "if there is no bound state , then the leading correction comes from the threshold and is @xmath175 , with nontopolgical subleading corrections .",
    "the fluctuation ( [ fluc ] ) can also be expressed in terms of the fermi distribution functions @xmath176 in ( [ number ] ) .",
    "noting the simple identity @xmath177 we see that ( [ fluc ] ) can be written as @xmath178 this formula is natural , since it is well known @xcite that for noninteracting fermions , the fluctuation in the occupation number of the state with energy @xmath64 is @xmath179 . in this paper",
    "we are considering the fermions to be in a fixed static background , so we are simply populating the single - particle energy levels of the corresponding dirac hamiltonian with noninteracting fermions , according to fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "this explains why the fluctuation vanishes at zero temperature , as the @xmath180 factors vanish exponentially fast .",
    "it also explains why the fluctuation is nontopological , since the integral in ( [ fsplit ] ) requires detailed knowledge of the spectrum .    for the family of special kink backgrounds in ( [ special ] ) ,",
    "the integral representation result ( [ kfi ] ) for the fluctuation can be re - expressed in terms of the fermi occupation numbers of the states in the spectrum : @xmath181 where the paired bound state energies @xmath182 for the special kink backgrounds ( [ special ] ) are at @xmath183 this expression ( [ kfsplit ] ) can be interpreted directly in terms of the general expression ( [ fsplit ] ) : we can easily identify the separate contributions from the unpaired bound state at @xmath133 , from the paired bound states at @xmath184 , and the contributions from the continuum cuts .",
    "since the integral in ( [ fsplit ] ) involves the even part of the spectral function , the symmetry of the spectrum indicated in fig . 8 does not lead to any particular simplification for the fluctuation , as there are no cancellations .",
    "hence , @xmath185 is nontopological , as it is manifestly dependent on the scale parameter @xmath125 .    in the sigma model case , we can interpret the equation ( [ fsplit ] ) as follows . as discussed previously , in the derivative expansion ,",
    "@xmath93 , limit , the leading effect of the background is that of a local chemical potential @xmath186 , in which case the local fermi distribution factors are given by ( [ fermi ] ) .",
    "thus , the fluctuation can be computed from ( [ fsplit ] ) as @xmath187\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int dx \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{dk}{2\\pi } \\left [ n(\\sqrt{k^2+m^2}-\\mu(x))\\left(1-n(\\sqrt{k^2+m^2}-\\mu(x))\\right)\\right .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+n(\\sqrt{k^2+m^2}+\\mu(x))\\left(1-n(\\sqrt{k^2+m^2}+\\mu(x))\\right)- 2 n(\\sqrt{k^2+m^2})\\left(1-n(\\sqrt{k^2+m^2})\\right)\\right ] \\label{fsigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last term is the subtraction of the free case with @xmath188",
    ". at low temperature , ( [ fsigma ] ) gives the leading contribution @xmath189 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\sim & 4\\sqrt{\\frac{mt}{2\\pi}}\\ , e^{-m\\beta}\\ , \\int dx \\",
    ", \\sinh^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta^\\prime}{4t}\\right ) \\label{fs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the low temperature behavior of the @xmath190 integral in ( [ limit ] ) .",
    "this expression ( [ fs ] ) agrees precisely with the resummed derivative expansion result ( [ fsm ] ) for the fluctuation .",
    "to conclude , we reiterate that the finite temperature induced fermion number @xmath51 is generically nontopological , and is not a sharp observable . the induced fermion number naturally splits into a topological temperature - independent piece that represents the effect of vacuum polarization on the dirac sea , and a nontopological temperature - dependent piece that represents the thermal population of the available states in the fermion spectrum , weighted with the appropriate fermi - dirac factors . as the temperature approaches zero ,",
    "the nontopological terms vanish exponentially fast , and we regain smoothly the familiar topological results at zero temperature . but at nonzero temperature , the nontopological contribution is more sensitive to the details of the spectrum , and so is generically nontopological .",
    "this is illustrated explicitly by a derivative expansion calculation , which is resummed to all orders at low temperature , for the case of a sigma model background .",
    "the induced fermion number @xmath51 only depends on the _ odd _ part of the spectral function .",
    "this means the case of a kink background is special because the dirac spectrum for a kink background is remarkably symmetric , and the odd part of the spectral function is itself a topological quantity , in the sense that it only depends on the asymptotic value of the kink field , rather than on the full details of the shape of the kink field .",
    "thus , the kink case is non - generic , and the finite temperature induced fermion number is actually topological , albeit a complicated function of the temperature and the asymptotic value of the kink field . on the other hand ,",
    "the fluctuation , @xmath153 , is determined by the even part of the spectral function , for which no general topological information is known .",
    "thus , the fluctuations are always nontopological at finite temperature .",
    "we illustrated this explicitly with an exact solution for a special class of kink backgrounds , and with a derivative expansion calculation for the sigma model case .",
    "the fluctuation vanishes at zero temperature , which shows that the induced fermion number is a sharp eigenvalue at zero temperature , in agreement with the arguments of @xcite .",
    "but at finite temperature , the nonvanishing of the fluctuations indicates that the induced fermion number is not a sharp eigenvalue at nonzero temperature .",
    "the source of the fluctuation is clearly the dispersion introduced by mixing states in the thermal average .",
    "an analogous example of an induced fermion number expectation value that is not sharp has been discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "some of these results generalize immediately to higher dimensional cases .",
    "for example , the dependence of @xmath51 on just the odd part of the spectrum means that if the background has the same susy isospectral features as the kink case , then the finite temperature induced fermion number will be topological .",
    "this was in fact found to be true in @xcite where the @xmath3 dimensional induced fermion number in the presence of a static @xmath191 t hooft - polyakov monopole was shown to have exactly the same form as in the @xmath2 dimensional kink case , with the identification of the asymptotic value of the kink with the asymptotic value of the magnitude of the monopole s higgs field .",
    "this gives an interesting finite temperature remnant of the quantum mechanical susy present in the dirac spectrum .",
    "conversely , without such a special symmetry of the dirac spectrum , the finite temperature induced fermion number will be generically nontopological .",
    "so , for example , for a chiral @xmath191 sigma model with a skyrme background in @xmath3 dimensions , it is well known from numerical work that the dirac energy spectrum of the fermions is not symmetric , and the energy of a possible bound state ( and indeed the number of bound states ) is highly sensitive to the details of the shape of the radial hedgehog field @xcite . since the leading low temperature contribution to the finite temperature fermion number in ( [ split ] )",
    "is determined by the lowest magnitude bound state energy [ see ( [ lowtsigma ] ) ] , this shows that in this case the finite temperature induced fermion number is nontopological .",
    "likewise , the fact that the finite temperature fluctuation @xmath153 depends on the even part of the spectral function indicates that this will be generally nontopological .",
    "finally , the interpretation in terms of the fluctuations for individual energy levels in the spectrum shows that the fluctuation is nonzero at finite temperature , but vanishing at zero temperature .",
    "thus , the induced fermion number is a sharp observable at zero temperature , but not at finite temperature .",
    "in particular , for a skyrme background in @xmath3 dimensions , the finite temperature fermion number is not simply the ( topological ) winding number of the skyrme field , but a much more complicated nontopological object .",
