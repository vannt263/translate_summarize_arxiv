    "noncentrosymmetric superconductors have been a subject of considerable interest since the discovery of superconductivity in the heavy fermion material cept@xmath1si.@xcite in particular it is the unique property of such noncentrosymmetric superconductors that in the presence of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) both spin singlet and spin triplet cooper pairs can , and must , coexist within a single material .",
    "this is quite general as , while in the complete absence of soc the two kinds of pairing are distinguished by their different behavior under rotations in spin space , once soc is finite then spin and space rotations can not be separated , and it is only the parity of the cooper pair wave function under spatial inversion , p , which separates spin singlet ( even ) from spin triplet ( odd ) states.@xcite in a noncentrosymmetric superconductor there is no lattice center of inversion , and so the parity operator , p , is not a well defined symmetry of the crystal , leading to mixing of singlet and triplet pairing states within a single material .",
    "an interesting analogy can be made with particle physics where the mixing of neutrino flavors is induced by violation of cp symmetry.@xcite the implication is that in noncentrosymmetric superconductors the order parameter is always unconventional . on the other hand",
    "the experimental situation is quite complex as some noncentrosymmetric superconductors such as cept@xmath1si are additionally strongly correlated while the superconducting state of others such as li@xmath0pd@xmath1b , baptsi@xmath1 or re@xmath1w appears to feature pure singlet pairing.@xcite    an important recent development has been the observation , through zero - field muon spin resonance ( @xmath2sr ) , of time reversal symmetry ( trs ) breaking at the superconducting instability of lanic@xmath3.@xcite superconductivity in this intermetallic compound@xcite was discovered in the mid nineties with critical temperature @xmath4.@xcite there was some discussion of whether it was a type ii or a dirty type i superconductor@xcite and the possibility that the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter was unconventional was debated.@xcite at the time , however , the lack of inversion symmetry was largely overlooked .",
    "in contrast , very recently there has been a surge of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite work on this system .",
    "some of this has been motivated by the results in ref .   which constitute very strong and direct evidence of unconventional pairing .",
    "in addition to this dramatic dependences of @xmath5 on cu , y and th doping have been identified.@xcite    two broad and mutually - exclusive scenarios have been proposed to describe the breaking of trs in the superconducting state of lanic@xmath0.@xcite in the first scenario , which is based on group - theoretical considerations,@xcite the superconducting order parameter is intrinsically unconventional : a non - unitary triplet pairing state . in the second scenario , based on first principles calculations,@xcite",
    "lanic@xmath0 is essentially a conventional superconductor but a small amount of triplet pairing is induced by soc , as described above , and is responsible for the observed breaking of trs .",
    "unfortunately both the group theoretical analysis of ref .   and the first principles calculations of ref .",
    "ignore relativistic effects .",
    "it is therefore unclear whether any of the eight superconducting instabilities that are allowed by symmetry and that preserve trs@xcite acquire a trs breaking component when soc is adiabatically turned on .",
    "more specifically it is not known whether the conventional superconducting state assumed in ref .  , which does not break trs , can acquire the necessary trs breaking component in this way .",
    "indeed it is well known@xcite that trs breaking requires a superconducting order parameter with degeneracy .",
    "however no such degeneracy should occur in an orthorhombic crystal with finite soc . in the present work we address this question directly by extending the previous symmetry analysis@xcite to include the effect of soc .",
    "the more general analysis that we present here allows us to conclude that the observation of time - reversal symmetry breaking at @xmath5 is not compatible with a conventional mechanism of the type proposed in ref .  .",
    "to address the pairing symmetry in the lanic@xmath0 crystal structure@xcite we first consider , following the original analysis,@xcite the possible pairing states if spin - orbit interaction is negligible .",
    "we then study how these states evolve when perturbed by soc .",
    "in particular we note in this paper that simply a combination of @xmath6-wave pairing and noncentrosymmetric crystal structure does not automatically lead to time - reversal symmetry breaking at @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that the low symmetry of the orthorhombic @xmath7 structure leads to only a small number of time - reversal symmetry breaking states in the absence of soc , all of which have degeneracy which is lifted when spin - orbit interaction is finite .",
    "therefore the observation of time - reversal symmetry breaking at @xmath5 provides a very strong constraint on the pairing state and is not naturally consistent with the conventional electron - phonon pairing mechanism or @xmath6-wave pairing .",
    "instead , the observation is only compatible with soc being small and with the system entering a non - unitary triplet pairing state at @xmath5 .",
    "our arguments are based on group theory and in that spirit the present analysis of the pairing symmetry in lanic@xmath3 does not rely on any specific assumptions about the origin of the pairing interaction , the band structure or the strength of soc**. * * the method is very well - established and has been very successful in the past for many other superconductors with a centre of inversion , e.g. the cuprates.@xcite more recently similar methods have been applied to noncentrosymmetric superconductors.@xcite we will nevertheless describe some of the main arguments in considerable detail to highlight the issue of trs breaking , both in the presence and absence of soc , as well as the features specific to the point symmetry of lanic@xmath0 .",
    "the possible symmetries of the superconducting instability in lanic@xmath3 assuming that soc can be neglected were enumerated in ref .  .",
    "in this section we give the details of the derivation emphasizing the similarities and differences with the case where there is a centre of inversion . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "the point group @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the direct product , @xmath11 is the point group of the crystal structure and @xmath12 represents all spin rotations .",
    "the irreducible representations therefore have the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are irreducible representations of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ( in principle , the full space group of the crystal must be taken into account ; however we assume that the translational symmetries are the same above and below @xmath16 , so it is enough to refer to the point group ) .",
    "a basis of @xmath17 is given by the functions @xmath18 where @xmath19 forms a basis of @xmath14 and @xmath20 forms a basis of @xmath15 .",
    "the dimensionality of @xmath17 is @xmath21 .",
    "the gap function just below @xmath16 is thus @xmath22    the spin rotation group @xmath12 is the same for all crystals .",
    "as is well known it has two irreducible representations ( irreps ) .",
    "the first of these is the singlet representation , of dimension 1 .",
    "this corresponds to order parameters of the form @xmath23 crucially , @xmath24 meaning that we must have @xmath25 .",
    "thus for singlet order parameters only the first term in @xmath26\\hat{\\sigma}_{y } , \\label{eq : gapf2}\\ ] ] is finite .",
    "the second irrep of @xmath12 is the triplet representation , of dimension 3 . for it",
    "we thus have @xmath27 moreover we have @xmath28 whereby the @xmath11 basis functions must be odd , @xmath29 , meaning that for triplet pairing ( [ eq : gapf2 ] ) has only the second term .",
    "the above results are very well known from the group theory analysis of centrosymmetric superconductors.@xcite they are also valid in the noncentrosymmetric case as long as soc can be neglected .",
    "in particular , the pairing symmetry must be purely of the singlet or triplet type in the limit in which soc does not play a role .",
    "the only difference with the case of centrosymmetric superconductors is that in a noncentrosymmetric superconductor the irreps of the crystal point group do not have distinct symmetries under inversion , so each of them is compatible with both singlet and triplet pairing .",
    "thus in lanic@xmath3 , where @xmath30 , each of the four irreps @xmath31 and @xmath32 [ table i in ref .",
    "] is compatible with singlet and triplet superconducting instabilities . since in this case",
    "all four irreps of @xmath11 are one - dimensional , this leads to a total of 12 possible instabilities : 4 in the singlet channel and 8 in the triplet channel ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "the possible symmetries of the gap function are reproduced in table [ tab : c2v_nosoc ] here for completeness .",
    "note that the non - unitary triplet pairing instabilities @xmath33 are the only ones that break trs , leading to the conclusion that the superconducting state just below @xmath16 features nonunitary triplet pairing.@xcite as noted in that reference one of these four forms of the gap function has the same point group symmetry as the crystal , which would not have been possible for triplet pairing in a centrosymmetric superconductor .",
    "the other three break additional symmetries . in the following section we analyse how this conclusion is affected by the inclusion of soc in the analysis .",
    ".[tab : c2v_nosoc]possible symmetries of the gap function of lanic@xmath3 just below @xmath16 in the case where soc can be neglected , written in terms of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gapf2 ] ) .",
    "each of the functions @xmath36 depend on the wave vector @xmath37 and they have the same symmetries under the opretaions of the point group @xmath38 as its three components @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that the case of the orthorhombic symmetry group @xmath38 appropriate for lanic@xmath0 is quite different from the tetragonal @xmath41 appropriate to cept@xmath1si@xcite . for @xmath41 one of the irreducible representations is two - dimensional , so time - reversal symmetry breaking is allowed even in the presence of strong soc .",
    "the point group studied here is also somewhat different from the monoclinic @xmath42 , studied by sergienko and curnoe.@xcite in this case there is only one two - fold rotation axis , and hence only two irreducible representations , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , both one - dimensional .",
    "nevertheless the general pattern of possible symmetry breakings for @xmath45 is similar to those given in tables i and ii . under @xmath42 the @xmath43 representation is equivalent to both @xmath43 and @xmath44 of @xmath38 , while the @xmath44 representation of @xmath42 is equivalent to @xmath46 and @xmath47 under @xmath38 .",
    "our main conclusion so far is that the observation of trs symmetry breaking implies that soc must be very weak , for no trs breaking superconducting instability of the normal state is compatible with the crystal s symmetry in the presence of soc .",
    "one the other hand , a small amount of soc must be present in any crystal , which raises the question of how the results of secs .  [",
    "sec : weak_soc ] and [ sec : strong_soc ] can be reconciled . to clarify this we consider the evolution of the instability as a small amount of soc is adiabatically turned on .",
    "each of the symmetry - allowed superconducting instabilities listed in table [ tab : c2v_nosoc ] will evolve into one of those listed in table [ tab : c2v_soc ] , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] . to ascertain the relationships depicted in the figure",
    ", we must express the gap function given in table [ tab : c2v_nosoc ] as a linear combination of those in table [ tab : c2v_soc ] .",
    "such linear combinations are unique . in particular , the @xmath37-dependences of the gap function just below the singlet superconducting instabilities",
    "are given by@xmath48 thus the @xmath49 and @xmath50 instabilities evolve into instabilities with @xmath31 and @xmath32 symmetries , respectively .",
    "moreover adiabatic continuity in the limit of vanishing soc places constraints on the coefficients @xmath51 in table [ tab : c2v_soc ] : in order that the coefficients @xmath52 vanish in the limit of zero soc , it is necessary for them to be small , compared to @xmath53 , when soc is weak but finite . by this mechanism",
    "a small triplet component [ i.e. a finite @xmath35 ] could be induced in an otherwise singlet superconductor by the action of soc alone .",
    "note , however , that such triplet component does not break trs .",
    "this is at variance with the claim made in ref .",
    ", as we discuss in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "similarly , the @xmath37-dependences of the gap function just below the four unitary triplet pairing instabilities are also in one - to - one correspondence with those of the relativistically - allowed ones:@xmath55 finally , for the four non - unitary triplet pairing instabilities the situation is somewhat more complicated .",
    "since they break trs , they can not evolve smoothly into one of the four symmetry - allowed instabilities as soc is turned on , as all of them preserve trs . indeed",
    "the gap matrix just below @xmath16 is a linear combination of two of the forms allowed in the presence of soc :    @xmath56    this implies that , unlike the singlet and unitary triplet instabilities _ the nonunitary triplet instabilities split under the influence of soc _ : as soc is increased the critical temperature @xmath16 splits into two transitions , one in which the order parameter takes one form and a second one where another component develops .",
    "the first transition does not break trs , but the second one does ( it would nt if the system went into that state straight from the normal state ; trs breaking is due to the presence of the other component of the order parameter and their relative phase , which is fixed by the requirement that the correct form is recovered in the limit of zero soc ) . in the limit of weak soc",
    ", the two transitions happen so close that they are indistinguishable from a single transition going straight into the state with broken trs .",
    "evolution of all the superconducting instabilities of the normal state of lanic@xmath3 allowed by symmetry in the absence of soc as the latter is adiabatically turned on : ( a ) singlet pairing instabilities ; ( b ) unitary triplet pairing instabilities ; ( c ) non - unitary triplet pairing instabilities .",
    "the relative temperatures of the different instabilities in this diagram are arbitrary . ]",
    "figure [ fig : evolution ] shows the evolution of the superconducting instabilities allowed by symmetry in the absence of soc as the latter is adiabtically turned on . we can pose the opposite question , which is : in the presence of strong soc , how is a general pairing state decomposed into the components that would be allowed in its absence ? this",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : venn ] .",
    "we note that in general the pairing states allowed in the presence of soc contain singlet , unitary and non - untiary triplet components .",
    "interestingly , the non - unitary states , which are the only ones that can break trs , are always shared between two different strong soc pairing states . on the other hand the singlet @xmath6-wave state never contributes to a trs breaking instability . also interestingly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : venn ] , the singlet @xmath57 state does mix with several triplet states , including part of the non - unitary triplet pairings @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless , and somewhat counter - intuitively , none of these combinations break trs .        in the light of the above analysis",
    "let us now consider possible pairing states in lanic@xmath0 .",
    "the authors of ref .   have argued that the normal state of lanic@xmath3 is weakly correlated and that the superconducting instability is of the conventional , @xmath6-wave type , resulting from phonon - mediated pairing of electrons .",
    "the justification provided for these assumptions is that a value of @xmath16 very close to that encountered in the experiments follows from them . to explain the observation @xcite of trs breaking , a small triplet component induced by soc is invoked",
    "indeed an order parameter with @xmath60 symmetry would develop a small triplet component as a result of soc , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adiab_evol_1a1 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : venn ] .",
    "unfortunately , however , such triplet component is not trs - breaking : only the non - unitary triplet pairing instabilities can break trs .",
    "these instabilities , on the other hand , only have a small @xmath6-wave component , which vanishes completely as soc is turned off .",
    "our results imply that _ only nonunitary triplet pairing is compatible with the observation of trs breaking . _    a second consequence of our results , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] , is that _ the superconducting instability must be split by soc . _",
    "since this only happens for the nonunitary triplet pairing instabilities , the observation of a split transition would be a direct consequence of trs breaking and confirm the nonunitary triplet pairing in this system .",
    "on the other hand , given that it has not been detected in any experiment to date , the splitting must be quite small .",
    "its observation may require the availability of single crystals , where any splitting may be more easily observed .",
    "an outstanding issue is the quantitative estimation of the size of soc in lanic@xmath3 .",
    "the band splitting has been calculated perturbatively using as the starting point a band structure obtained in the local density approximation ( lda).@xcite an average band splitting of @xmath61 about half the value of that obtained by a similar method in the noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductor cept@xmath62si,@xcite was found .",
    "given that the critical temperature of lanic@xmath3 is about three times higher than that of cept@xmath62si this suggests that the possible role played by soc in lanic@xmath3 is smaller .",
    "that said , even in this case the obtained splitting is an average , and for some parts of the fermi surface it can be either larger or smaller than that value.@xcite the importance of soc thus depends on a number of details that are as yet unkwon , such as the exact functional form of the superconducting order parameter . in any case",
    "the average value is much larger than the superconducting gap , and of the same order of magnitude as the debye energy.@xcite yet as we have shown above if soc had a strong effect on the superconducting instability the latter would not break trs , which is at variance with the experimental data.@xcite we note that lda - based estimates of soc have been called into question in the case of the heavy fermion noncentrosymmetric superconductor cept@xmath62si@xcite where de haas - van alphen oscillations have failed to detect the predicted band splitting.@xcite    all discussions so far of the implications of the observation of trs breaking in lanic@xmath3 , @xcite including the one presented here , assume that this is a bulk phenomenon .",
    "however albeit very pure , the samples on which this was observed were polycrystalline.@xcite a distinct possibility is that the observations could correspond to a breaking of trs at the boundaries between crystallites.@xcite on such surfaces the crystal symmetry is broken and the list of symmetry - allowed superconducting instabilities is altered . on the other hand in the experiment described in ref .",
    "muons were deposited uniformly throughout the bulk of the sample .",
    "any magnetic fields occurring only at the boundaries between crystallites would have been screened over distances of the order of the penetration depth , @xmath63 . in order to discard completely this possibility it",
    "would therefore be required to know this number , which can be obtained for example in a transverse - field @xmath2sr experiment .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied , on the basis of group - theoretical considerations , the effect of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) of arbitrary strength on the superconducting instability of the noncentrosymmetric intermetallic compound lanic@xmath3 .",
    "we have paid particular attention to the issue of time reversal symmetry ( trs ) breaking .",
    "while in the absence of soc there are 12 possible superconducting instabilities , of which 4 break trs , when soc is taken into account there are only 4 superconducting instabilities of the normal state , and none of them break trs . to reconcile this result with the experimental observation of trs breaking on entering the superconducting state @xcite",
    "we have studied the evolution of the superconducting instability as a small amount of soc is adiabatically turned on .",
    "we have found that each of the 8 trs - preserving singlet and unitary triplet instabilities evolve smoothly into one of the 4 that are allowed in the presence of soc and we have obtained the form these must take when soc is small , but finite . in particular our analysis shows a small triplet component developing on top of an @xmath6-wave order parameter .",
    "however , this mechanism is found _ not _ to lead to trs breaking .",
    "a similar analysis for the case of the 4 nonunitary triplet pairing instabilities reveals that each of them splits into two distinct transitions : an instability of the normal state where superconductivity emerges without the breaking of trs , followed by a second superconducting instability where the order parameter acquires an additional component and trs is broken .",
    "we thus conclude that the superconducting instability must be of the nonunitary triplet type and that soc must be comparatively small in this system so as to make the first and second transitions indiscernible .",
    "a distinct prediction of this analysis is a splitting of the superconducting transition that could be observed in single crystals and enhanced by the application of pressure .",
    "since only the nonunitary triplet pairing instabilities are split in this way , its observation would be a direct consequence of the broken trs and constitute definitive proof of nonunitary triplet pairing in this system .",
    "non - unitary triplet pairing is believed to be realised in the ferromagnetic superconductors.@xcite in contrast , the normal state of lanic@xmath3 just above @xmath5 is paramagnetic .",
    "this material therefore constitutes the first example of an `` intrinsically '' nonunitary triplet superconductor where the pairing of electrons with only one value of the spin does not result from a pre - existing exchange splitting .",
    "elucidating the mechanism by which this comes about , and the possible role that the lack of inversion symmetry may play in it , is an outstanding challenge .",
