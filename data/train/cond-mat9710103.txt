    "the spectral dimension @xmath1 of non translation invariant structures is up to now the best generalization of euclidean dimension of lattices when dealing with dynamical and thermodynamical properties .",
    "it can be defined according to the large time asymptotic behavior of random walks and can be shown to be relevant for several different physical phenomena , such as vibrational dynamics , electrical conductivity and phase transitions .",
    "many properties of @xmath1 has been argued and proved starting from exact analytical calculations on a few particular cases and any further progress in understanding its relevance strongly depends on the availability of exact results in a wider range of particular cases .",
    "the most used mathematical tools to calculate @xmath1 belong to two main classes : renormalization group and combinatorial techniques . unfortunately renormalization group can give exact results only on exactly decimable fractals which , in turn , have been shown to have @xmath2 . on the other hand combinatorial techniques , based on iteration of cuttings , can be applied only to discrete structures with a given characteristic scale .",
    "recently , a particular combination of both techniques has been successfully applied to the more complex case of @xmath0 lattices @xcite .",
    "these lattices are not exactly decimable but they are invariant under a more complex geometrical transformation we shall call cutting - decimation . on @xmath0 lattices the random walks problem has been analytically solved using a cutting - decimation method based on a time - rescaling technique @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 has been shown to have remarkable properties such as non integer spectral dimension equal or greater then 2 , non anomalous diffusion laws , absence of phase transitions @xcite and dynamical dimension splitting @xcite .",
    "because of these peculiar characteristics @xmath0 lattices have been widely used for the study of statistical mechanics on non translation invariant lattices and they opened the way to the research of other structures sharing the same properties .",
    "in this paper we deal with generalizations of @xmath0 lattices we shall call @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 introducing three corresponding new techniques to solve analytically the random walks problem . as a result",
    "we obtain very general structures with the same properties of @xmath0 and , at the same time , we test new techniques that can be useful in other cases of non exactly decimable fractals .",
    "the @xmath3 are infinite fractal trees that can be recursively built using the following recipe ( fig .",
    "an origin point @xmath7 is connected to point @xmath8 by a link of length 1 ( the log of the tree ) ; from @xmath8 the log splits in @xmath9 branches of length @xmath10 ( i.e. made of @xmath10 consecutive links ) which , in turn , split in @xmath9 branches of length @xmath11 and so on in such a way that each branch of length @xmath12 splits in @xmath9 branches of length @xmath13 .",
    "the simplest case is that of @xmath14 and corresponds to the @xmath0 lattices .",
    "the @xmath3 invariance under the cutting - decimation transform can be described as follows ( fig .",
    "2 ) . suppose to cut the log of the tree and to separate the @xmath9 branches starting from @xmath8 .",
    "then each of these branches is exactly the same as the original tree with a dilatation factor equal to @xmath10 and therefore it can be reduced to the original tree through decimation .",
    "let us now consider the discrete time random walks problem on @xmath3 , in order to calculate the spectral dimension @xmath1 of the lattice .",
    "the spectral dimension of a graph is defined through the relation @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the probability for a random walker to return to the starting point @xmath7 after a walk of @xmath17 steps for @xmath18 .",
    "the cutting transformation applied to random walks gives a relation between @xmath19 , the probability of returning to the starting site @xmath7 after a @xmath17 steps walk on the whole tree , and @xmath20 , the probability of returning to the starting site @xmath8 after a @xmath17 steps walks on one of the branches starting from @xmath8 .",
    "this relation has been obtained in @xcite for the case @xmath14 in terms of the generating functions ( discrete laplace transforms ) @xmath21 of the probabilities @xmath22 , but it holds for @xmath3 for every @xmath23 : @xmath24 in the @xmath14 case the decimation transformation has been performed using a time - rescaling technique . indeed , the motion of the random walker on the branch considered only after an even number of steps can be exactly mapped in the motion of a random walker on the tree after the introduction of a staying probability @xmath25 in every site @xmath26 .",
    "this equivalence can be translated in terms of generating functions through the substitutions @xcite : @xmath27 @xmath28 in the case @xmath14 equations ( [ uno ] ) and ( [ due ] ) can be used to rewrite ( [ halley ] ) as : @xmath29 if @xmath30 this procedure must be iterated @xmath23 times obtaining : @xmath31 with @xmath32 @xmath26 being the iteration step . to find the value of @xmath1 we consider the singularities of the generating functions as @xmath33 , @xmath34 . in terms of @xmath35",
    "the decimation transformation can be resumed as : @xmath36 as @xmath37 , so that ( [ muir ] ) becomes : @xmath38 from ( [ rel ] ) , applying standard tauberian theorems techniques @xcite one obtains for a @xmath3 graph : @xmath39 which represent the generalization of the result obtained for @xmath14 .",
    "the previous results can be extended to @xmath4 , where now @xmath41 is an integer and not necessarily a power of 2 , and to @xmath42 , where the branches of @xmath0 are replaced by @xmath43-vertices regular polygons ( fig .",
    "3 ) . let us consider @xmath4 first .",
    "while relation ( [ halley ] ) still holds , the exact time - rescaling procedure can not be applied to the branch of generic length @xmath41 .",
    "however even in this case it is possible to obtain an asymptotic recursion relation applying the renormalization group techniques usually implemented on exactly decimable fractals @xcite . although this procedure can not give an exact equation for @xmath44 as in the previous case , nevertheless it can be used to obtain the exact value of @xmath1 via an asymptotic estimation",
    "indeed , in this case the branch of the @xmath4 can be considered as a tree with a dilatation factor equal to @xmath41 .",
    "the log of this tree can be reduced to a unitary length log after the suppression of the @xmath45 sites between the edges and introducing a new link connecting the edges .",
    "the same operation can be repeated for branches of every length suppressing the inner @xmath45 consecutive sites in every sequence of @xmath41 sites and introducing a new link between the surviving points .",
    "the final structure is equal to the original tree and the generating function @xmath46 becomes @xmath47 where : @xmath48 @xmath49 now @xmath47 coincides with @xmath50 since our branch has been transformed into a tree and ( [ halley ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath51 using the procedure described in the previous section for @xmath6 , from ( [ stella ] ) it follows that for an @xmath52 the spectral dimension is given by : @xmath53 an analogous technique can be used for @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "the log polygon has now @xmath43 faces of unitary length ; from each of @xmath54 of its vertices @xmath9 polygons depart , whose faces have length @xmath41 and so on . these structures , though similar to @xmath0 are no longer loopless structures nor necessarily bipartite graphs ( e.g. the @xmath55 tree ) .",
    "the cutting - decimation transform can be applied to @xmath42 as in the case of @xmath0 with the same substitutions ( [ tre ] ) and ( [ quattro ] ) . indeed , even if ( [ halley ] ) does not hold in this case , a new relation between the generating functions of the tree and that of one of its branches can be obtained using bundled structures theory @xcite .",
    "a bundle structure is a composed graph obtained by joining to each point of a  base graph \" a copy of a  fibre \" graph in such a way that every fibre has only one point in common with the base and no points in common with the other fibers .",
    "let us consider a @xmath42 and suppose to attach @xmath9 branches also in the free vertex of the log ( the root of the tree ) : we obtain a bundled structure having the log polygon as base and the graph made of @xmath9 branches as fibre .",
    "since for a @xmath43-polygon : @xmath56 as @xmath57 , we obtain for our bundled structure : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the generating function of the probability of returning to point @xmath7 ( one of the vertices of the log polygon ) after a random walk on the bundled structure and @xmath60 is the generating function of the probability of returning for the first time to the point of connection with the base after a random walk on the fibre . for a generic structure the generating function of the probability of returning to the starting point @xmath7 , @xmath61 and of returning for the first time to the starting point , @xmath62 , satisfy @xcite : @xmath63 using : @xmath64 where @xmath65 refers to the @xmath42 , from ( [ primo ] ) , ( [ secondo ] ) and ( [ terzo ] ) a relation between @xmath44 and @xmath66 follows , which represents the cutting transformation .",
    "it is now possible to perform the cutting - decimation transform to @xmath42 and get : @xmath67 in the same way we can calculate the spectral dimension of an @xmath0 built with @xmath68dimensional simplexes instead of @xmath69 .",
    "a @xmath70-dimensional simplex is a complete graph of @xmath71 points i.e. a graph where each point is nearest neighbor of all other points .",
    "the @xmath72dimensional case is the triangle , the @xmath73dimensional one is the tetrahedron and so on . since for @xmath68simplex @xmath74",
    "the spectral dimension is : @xmath75",
    "the generalized @xmath0 lattices described here have in general non integer spectral dimension depending on the geometrical features of the lattices , such as the growing factor @xmath10 or @xmath41 , the number of branches @xmath9 and the number of vertices of the polygon .",
    "since the intrinsic fractal dimension always coincides with the spectral dimension , the diffusion @xcite on all these lattices is not anomalous i.e. is described by the asymptotic law : @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "moreover as in the case of simple @xmath0 lattices @xcite , we can show that also generalized @xmath0 present dynamical dimension splitting .",
    "this means that the vibrational spectral dimension @xmath78 , which characterizes the density of vibrational modes as @xmath79 through the relation : @xmath80 is different from the diffusive spectral dimension of random walks @xmath1 .",
    "in particular we have @xmath81 and this can be intuitively understood noting that the topology of generalized @xmath0 is dominated by linear chains which become longer and longer in the outer branches . since @xmath81 , by the generalized mermin and wagner theorem @xcite , phase transitions with spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry for non zero temperature can not occur on these structures .",
    "all these remarkable properties , typical of simple @xmath0 lattices , have been here obtained even in absence of some peculiar characteristics of @xmath0 such as the bipartite and loopless nature of the graph .",
    "this enlarged family of lattices can be used , as @xmath0 lattices , to reach a better understanding of the geometrical features giving rise to dynamical dimension splitting and , at the same time , they represent the testing ground to study the relation between spectral dimensions and physical phenomena .",
