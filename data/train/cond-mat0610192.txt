    "although the discovery of quasicrystals @xcite , which are alloys with an structure neither periodic , nor disordered , launched an extensive investigation on quasiperiodic hamiltonians , in fact the study of such hamiltonians goes back to the old frenkel - kontorova model @xcite and to the pioneer research made in the seventies @xcite . here",
    "the word quasiperiodic means that in the system there are incommensurate periods ; and as a result , the dimension of the fourier space is always bigger than the dimensionality of the system .",
    "one of the most famous quasiperiodic hamiltonians was obtained by harper in connection with a problem proposed by peierls @xcite .",
    "the idea was to find the spectrum and the wave - functions of an electron in a square lattice with a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "two periods are involved in the problem , the electron motion in the lattice and the cyclotron frequency @xcite .",
    "the spectrum as a function of ratio between these periods turned out to be a complex set known as the hostaedter butterfly @xcite ( see figure 1 ) . since then , the harper model has been very useful to investigate the transition from localized to extended eigenstates , as the spectrum pass from pure point to continuous @xcite@xcite@xcite . between both limits",
    ", there is a new type of spectrum which is known as singular continuous @xcite .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates are called critical and show self - similar properties . for certain parameters of the harper equation , the distribution of level spacings follows an inverse power law @xcite , which is a new type of spectral statistics @xcite , explained as a level clustering tendency @xcite .",
    "it has been possible to find analytical expressions for the wave - functions using quantum groups @xcite .",
    "more recently , the quantum phase diagrams @xcite and the electronic correlation effects have been analyzed @xcite .",
    "another quasiperiodic system that has been extensively studied is the fibonacci chain ( fc ) .",
    "this chain is the simplest model of a quasicrystal @xcite .",
    "the importance of this hamiltonian arises because the nature of the physical properties of quasicrystals is still not well understood @xcite@xcite@xcite . even in the theoretical side",
    "there is a lack of understanding in how electrons propagate , specially in two and three dimensions @xcite . as is well known ,",
    "a periodic potential satisfies the bloch 's theorem , which tells that the eigenstates of the schredinger equation are plane waves of delocalized nature , and the energy spectrum is continuous @xcite . for disordered systems , like in the one dimensional ( 1d ) anderson model",
    ", all the states are localized corresponding to isolated eigenvalues @xcite . in more dimensions , there is a mobility edge which separates extended from localized states @xcite . for most of the quasiperiodic systems in 1d , the spectrum is neither continuous nor singular , instead a new type of spectrum , called singular continuous is obtained @xcite .",
    "this kind of spectrum is similar to a cantor set , and presents a multifractal nature .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions are called critical , and also show self - similarity and multifractality . in two and three dimensions ,",
    "the nature of the spectrum is not known , although there seems to be a kind of mobility edge @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , even in 1d , where large amount of work has been done , there are many unsolved questions , like the nature of conductivity @xcite or diffusivity @xcite , the spectral statistics and the shape of many of the eigenfunctions @xcite@xcite . even in the fc , there are no analytical expression for the wave functions , except for few energies @xcite .",
    "the harper and fibonacci potentials share many characteristics ; for example , both can present a multifractal spectrum with self - similar wave functions , although the harper equation can also present pure point and continuous spectrum .",
    "an interesting question is why fibonacci does not show pure point or continuous spectrum .",
    "furthermore , is it possible to build the analogous of the hostadter butterfly for the fc ?",
    "an understanding of these questions will serve to give a better picture of the electronic properties of quasiperiodic systems .",
    "for example , it can suggest a way to construct analytical solutions for the fc in terms of those solutions from harper .    in this article",
    ", we show that in fact , the fibonacci potential can be made from a superposition of harper potentials .",
    "then , we can follow the transition of the hofstadter butterfly to the equivalent in the fibonacci case .",
    "this allows to explore the equations in reciprocal space of the fc .",
    "the layout of this work is the following , in section ii we show how to obtain the fibonacci potential in terms of harper .",
    "section iii is devoted to a discussion of the corresponding spectra using the properties in reciprocal space , while section iv is devoted to study the localization in terms of the correlators of the potential .",
    "finally , in section v the conclusions are given .",
    "as a general model we will use a tight - binding hamiltionian of the type , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wave - function at site @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the resonance integral between sites @xmath2 and @xmath4 . for the present purposes , @xmath3",
    "is set to @xmath5 for all sites .",
    "@xmath6 is the atomic on - site potential and @xmath7 are the allowed energies .",
    "the generalized harper equation is obtained when @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the strength of the potential , @xmath10 is a parameter that contains the ratio between the electron cyclotron frequency and the elementary quantum flux , and @xmath11 is a phase shift . for a rational @xmath10 , eq .",
    "( [ tb ] ) can be solved by bloch s theorem since the problem is periodic , although the value of such theorem is very limited since the coefficients in fourier space of the solution form a dense set @xcite . for @xmath10 irrational , the spectrum depends on the value of @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath13 the spectrum is continuous with extended wave functions , for @xmath14 the spectrum is made from pure points and localized solutions .",
    "for @xmath15 the spectrum is singular continuous with self - similar wave functions .",
    "the other potential that we will consider , is the simplest model of a quasicrystal , obtained when @xmath6 has two possible values , @xmath16 and @xmath17 following the fibonacci sequence ( fs ) .",
    "the fs is build as follows : consider two letters , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the substitution rules , @xmath20 and @xmath21 if one defines the first generation sequence as @xmath22 and the second one as @xmath23 , the subsequent chains are generated using the two previous rules , for instance , @xmath24 starting with an @xmath18 , we construct the following sequences , @xmath25 @xmath19,@xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 and so on . each generation obtained by iteration of the rules",

    "this can be done in the following way . by using the cut and projection method",
    ", it is very easy to prove that a one dimensional chain with atoms at positions @xmath36 determined by a fs are given by @xcite,@xmath37 where the function @xmath38 denotes the greatest integer lower than @xmath39  is a parameter which turns out to be the inverse of the golden mean @xmath40 .",
    "the separation between atoms is @xmath41 in the fibonacci sequence , the separation takes two values , @xmath42 and @xmath43 thus , we can make a fibonacci potential with the sequence of spacings to get,@xmath44 using the identity @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the decimal part of @xmath47 , we obtain that @xmath6 can be written as,@xmath48 where @xmath49 is an average potential that shifts the zero of the energies , and @xmath50 is the strength of the quasiperiodicity , measured by the difference between site - energies @xmath51 . in what follows , without any loss of generality we set @xmath16 and @xmath17 in such a way that @xmath52 now , if the integer variable @xmath2 is replaced by a continuous one , say again @xmath47 , the resulting potential @xmath53 is just a square wave as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the potential stays at -@xmath54 for an interval of length @xmath55 and then it jumps to @xmath56 for a length @xmath57    the decimal part function @xmath46 has period @xmath58 and can be developed as a fourier series,@xmath59 it follows that , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the @xmath62 harmonic of the fourier series , @xmath63 the first terms of this series are shown in figure 1 , and in fact , we are approximating a square wave by a sum of cosines . notice the very slow convergence of the series due to the @xmath64 factor of each harmonic .",

    "( [ fibo ] ) , in such a way that the terms @xmath66 are replaced by @xmath67 .",
    "this phase is only a horizontal translation of the potential . for @xmath68",

    "there is an important change between the pure harper case and the second harmonic case .",
