    "@xcite and references therein ) . in the early stages ,",
    "the possibility of a linear 3@xmath12 chain structure was proposed for @xmath7c(@xmath8 ) by morinaga _",
    "however , the linear chain structure of @xmath7c(@xmath8 ) has been excluded by the @xmath12 decay width of this state @xcite . later theoretical studies with @xmath6 cluster models have revealed that @xmath7c(@xmath8 ) is a weakly bound @xmath6 state with neither geometric structures of the linear chain nor triangle structures @xcite .",
    "further extended models that do not rely on assumptions of the existence of clusters have also obtained similar results of the cluster feature in @xmath7c@xmath13 @xcite .    in 2001 , tohsaki _ et al . _",
    "proposed a new interpretation of @xmath7c(@xmath8 ) @xcite , i.e. , the `` @xmath12 cluster gas '' in which @xmath12 clusters are weakly interacting like a gas @xcite .",
    "in such a dilute cluster system , @xmath12 particles behave as bosonic particles ; therefore , this state has been discussed in relation to the @xmath12 condensation predicted in dilute infinite matter @xcite .",
    "the cluster gas phenomenon has been attracting great interest because it is a new concept of the cluster state and is different from the traditional concept of geometric cluster structures , in which clusters are localized and have a specific spatial configuration . indeed , in this decade , theoretical and experimental studies of nuclei , such as @xmath11he , @xmath14be , @xmath2b , and @xmath15o , have included intensive searching for cluster gas states @xcite .    for @xmath2b , a developed @xmath0 cluster structure in the @xmath5 state",
    "was predicted by a @xmath0 cluster model @xcite and the method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 state at 8.56 mev is assigned to this @xmath0 state because the experimentally measured @xmath16 and monopole transition strengths @xcite and the @xmath17 transition strength of the mirror state @xcite are reproduced by the calculation .",

    "how can we extend the @xmath12 cluster gas picture to the @xmath1 state containing a @xmath3 cluster with negative parity ?",
    "second , it is not obvious whether the @xmath0 cluster state shows a nongeometric feature because a state with three clusters is more bound in the @xmath0 system than in the @xmath6 system , resulting in a smaller size of @xmath2b(@xmath5 ) than that of @xmath7c(@xmath8 ) because of the deeper effective potential between @xmath3 and @xmath12 clusters than that between two @xmath12 clusters . in this study , we reanalyze the @xmath2b and @xmath7c wave functions obtained by amd calculations in previous studies @xcite and investigate the motion of a @xmath3 cluster around @xmath4 .",
    "we pay particular attention to the angular motion of the @xmath3 cluster with respect to the @xmath4 orientation to judge whether the @xmath0 structures in @xmath2b have a geometric feature with an angular correlation or a nongeometric structure with weak angular correlation similar to the @xmath6 gas state of @xmath7c@xmath19 ) .",
    "we also discuss the analogy and differences between @xmath0 structures in @xmath2b and @xmath6 structures in @xmath7c . by considering the body - fixed plane of three clusters",
    ", we can connect the @xmath20-wave motion of the @xmath3 cluster around @xmath4 to the @xmath18-wave motion of the @xmath12 cluster around @xmath4 , and then extend the picture of the @xmath6 cluster gas to the @xmath0 system .",

    "let us consider the angular motion in the extreme case of @xmath138 . in the angular distribution of the @xmath12 cluster moving around the @xmath4 , the probability completely vanishes at @xmath107 and @xmath104 because of the pauli exclusion principle between nucleons in different @xmath12 clusters .",

    "the opposite sign for a @xmath3 wave function is a consequence of the negative parity of the total @xmath0 system , which originally comes from the negative parity of the lowest allowed orbit for the @xmath3-@xmath12 intercluster motion , because the @xmath3 cluster consists of odd - numbered fermions . by taking the absolute value of the @xmath3-cluster angular wave function , having two nodes at @xmath107 and @xmath104 around the @xmath4 in the @xmath0 system , we can obtain an angular distribution similar to the @xmath12 distribution around the @xmath4 in the @xmath6 system , which means that the one - dimensional @xmath3 motion in the angular mode around the fixed @xmath4 core can be mapped on the @xmath12 motion around @xmath4 . in three - dimensional space , the phase of the @xmath3 wave function of the @xmath68 orbit changes by @xmath141 in the rotation around the @xmath56-axis .",
    "again by taking the absolute value of the @xmath3 wave function , it may be possible to consider a mapping of the @xmath3-cluster motion onto the @xmath12-cluster motion , if the @xmath12 probability is suppressed at @xmath107 and @xmath104 .    in the @xmath6 system for @xmath7c(@xmath8 ) , the @xmath12 probability is somewhat suppressed at @xmath107 and @xmath104 in the @xmath142 fm region . in this region , the angular motion of the @xmath3 cluster in @xmath2b(@xmath5 ) has some association with the @xmath12-cluster motion in @xmath7c(@xmath8 ) , as described previously .",

    "the @xmath12 cluster distribution is isotropic and goes to the ideal @xmath18-wave motion in the asymptotic region , where the blocking effect from the core vanishes ; by comparison , the @xmath3 cluster in a @xmath20 wave always has the node structure in the angular mode , even in the asymptotic region .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath3 cluster in @xmath2b(@xmath143 is distributed in a wide @xmath61 region around the @xmath4 , indicating that the total system has a non - geometric cluster structure with weak angular correlation rather than a geometric structure .",
    "if we tolerate the exclusion of @xmath105 and @xmath104 regions and extend the concept of the cluster gas as a developed cluster structure with weak angular correlation , @xmath2b(@xmath5 ) can be interpreted as a kind of cluster gas of @xmath0 .",

    "<S> we reanalyze @xmath0 cluster features of @xmath1 states in @xmath2b by investigating the @xmath3 cluster distribution around a @xmath4 core in @xmath2b , calculated with the method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) . in the @xmath5 state , </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath3 cluster is distributed in a wide region around @xmath4 , indicating that the @xmath3 cluster moves rather freely in angular as well as radial motion . from the weak angular correlation and radial extent of the @xmath3 cluster distribution , </S>",
    "<S> we propose an interpretation of a @xmath0 cluster gas for the @xmath5 state . in this study , we compare the @xmath0 cluster feature in @xmath2b(@xmath5 ) with the @xmath6 cluster feature in @xmath7c(@xmath8 ) , and discuss their similarities and differences . </S>"
